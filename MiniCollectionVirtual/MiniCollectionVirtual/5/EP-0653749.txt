<ABSTRACT>
In an optical information recording/reproducing 
apparatus, while a magnetooptical recording medium 

formed by stacking at least a recording layer, which 
consists of a perpendicular magnetization film for 

magnetically holding information, and a reproducing 
layer whose magnetic coupled state with said recording 

layer changes in accordance with a temperature is 
rotated at a fixed angular velocity, a laser beam is 

applied to the medium from the reproducing layer 
thereby reproducing information held by the recording 

layer by transferring the information to the 
reproducing layer. First, information which indicates 

a relation of an optimum intensity of the laser beam in 
reproduction with respect to a radial position on the 

recording medium, previously recorded on the recording 
medium is reproduced. Then, the intensity of the laser 

beam is adjusted on the basis of the information 
indicating the relation of the optimum intensity of the 

laser beam with respect to the radial position on the 
recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical
information recording/reproducing apparatus and method
and, more particularly, to an optical information
recording/reproducing apparatus and method of
performing at least one of recording and reproduction
of information by using a magnetooptical interaction.Methods of recording and reproducing information
with respect to a disc-like information recording
medium (to be referred to as an optical disc
hereinafter) by using a magnetooptical interaction
(polar Kerr effect) are conventionally known. Among
these methods, a medium construction as shown Figs. 1A
to 1C is proposed as a super-resolving technique which
realizes a recording density higher than the optical
resolving power of reproducing light.Fig. 1A shows the section of an optical disc as
one example of the super-resolving technique. A
substrate 20 is usually constructed of a transparent
material such as glass or polycarbonate. An enhance
layer 21, a reproducing layer 22, a recording layer 23, 
and a protective layer 24 are stacked in this order on
the substrate 20. The arrows in the magnetic materials
indicate the directions of magnetization in the films.The recording layer 23 is a film made of a
material, such as TbFeCo or DyFeCo, having a high
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Recording
information is held in accordance with whether the
magnetic domain in this layer is directed upward or
downward. The reproducing layer 22 is constructed of a
material with a large saturation magnetization Ms and a
small perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Although the
reproducing layer 22 is a longitudinal magnetization
film at room temperature, it becomes a perpendicular
magnetization film when a predetermined temperature Tth
is reached, since the saturation magnetization Ms
decreases.When an information-reproducing beam is irradiated
onto the magnetic film with this arrangement from the
substrate side, a temperature gradient as in Fig. 1C is
obtained in the center of a data track. When viewed
from the substrate, the isotherm of the predetermined
temperature Tth is present within a spot as illustrated
in Fig. 1B. Therefore, the reproducing layer 22 does
not contribute to the polar Kerr effect since the layer
becomes a longitudinal magnetization film at the
predetermined temperature Tth or lower as discussed
above. Consequently, the information in the recording 
layer 23 is masked and therefore cannot be seen from
the reproducing beam. On the other hand, a portion of
the reproducing layer 22, that is at the
