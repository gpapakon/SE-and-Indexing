<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for positioning an injection head inside a sleeved tube. Close to the sleeved tube (2), and preferably against its outer wall, there is placed at least one electronic tag (9) containing information; close to the injection head (5) there is placed a device (10) allowing information contained in the electronic tags (9) to be read; and the injection head (5) is positioned in the sleeved tube (2) on the basis of the information contained in the electronic tags (9) which are read by the reading device (10). The invention also relates to the implementation of such a method.

Method for positioning an injection head inside a tube with sleeves arranged
in a borehole from which the injection of a product into the ground is

performed, characterised by the fact that at least one electronic tag (9)
containing information is placed in the vicinity of the tube with sleeves (2), and

preferably against the outer wall thereof; additionally, an electronic tag (14)
containing in its memory information making it possible to identify the borehole

(1) is arranged in the vicinity of the inlet of the borehole (1); a device (10) is
placed in the vicinity of the injection head (5), said device (10) making it

possible to read information from the electronic tags (9); and the injection head
(5) is positioned in the tube with sleeves (2) depending on the information

contained in the electronic tags (9), which are read by the reading device (10).
Method according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact that use is made of
tags capable of recording information, such as those known by the name of

transponder, and of a reading device (10) allowing information also to be
written to the electronic tags (9).
Method according to any one of Claims 1 or 2, applied to a downward-oriented
borehole, characterised by the fact that an electronic tag (9) is placed above

and at a predetermined distance from each sleeve (4), while the reading and,
if appropriate, writing device (10) is placed at a point on the injection head (5)

such that, when the device (10) passes directly in line with an electronic tag
(9), two inflatable obturators (6, 7) for the injection head (5) are located on

either side of orifices (3) closed off by a sleeve (4), and that the displacement
of the injection head (5) inside the tube with sleeves (2) is halted when the

reading and, if appropriate, writing device (10) is located directly in line with the
electronic tag (9) that is placed above the sleeve (4) through which the injection

has to take place.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised by the fact that
the reading and, if appropriate, writing device (10) is connected to a central

computer, and preferably a monitoring terminal.
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised by the fact that
information concerning the background of the relevant injections, such as their 

number, their date, their degree and the nature of the injected product, is
recorded in the memory of the tags (9).
Device for performing the injection of the product into the ground by using the
method according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, of the type in which an injection

head is engaged inside a tube with sleeves that is introduced into an injection
borehole, characterised by the fact that electronic tags (9) are positioned at

different locations on the tube with sleeves (2), preferably outside the latter,
that the injection head (5) comprises a device (10) for reading information

stored in the electronic tags (9), and that an electronic tag that contains in its
memory information allowing the borehole to be identified is arranged in the

vicinity of the inlet of the borehole.
Device according to Claim 6, characterised by the fact that the tags are
capable of recording information and that the reading device (10) is capable

of sending information to the tags (9) in order to write it there.
Device according to any one of Claims 6 or 7, characterised by the fact that the
reading and, if appropriate, writing device (10) is connected to a central

computer and preferably also a monitoring terminal.
Device according to any one of Claims 7 or 8, characterised by the fact that the
tube with sleeves (2) is made of a material that allows electromagnetic waves

to pass through, for example, PVC.
