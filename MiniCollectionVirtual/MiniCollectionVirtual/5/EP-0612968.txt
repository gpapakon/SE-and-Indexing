<ABSTRACT>
A method for pretreating a natural gas stream using 
a single scrub column to remove freezable C₅+ components 

and provide an LNG product which can be conveniently 
handled and shipped is disclosed. The method comprises 

feeding a natural gas stream to a feed point on a scrub 
column operated substantially as an absorption column 

wherein the heavy components are absorbed from the feed 
gas using a liquid reflux essentially free of such C₅+ 

components. The feed can be vapor introduced at a low 
point on the column, or can be optionally split, cooled 

and/or expanded and introduced at one or more feed points 
on the column. The reflux stream can be overhead vapor 

condensate having a temperature of about -40°C, or 
methane-rich LNG or a combination of LNG and vapor 

condensate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of pretreating 
a natural gas stream comprising the features of 
the preamble of claim 1. Such a method is 
known, for example, from US-A-4 012 212. Natural gas is liquefied to facilitate its 
transportation. Prior to liquefaction, raw natural gas 
must generally be treated to remove components which can 
freeze and plug equipment during the formation and/or 
processing of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Thus, water, 
carbon dioxide and heavier hydrocarbon components 
containing 5 or more carbon atoms (C5+) are generally 
removed. It has typically also been desirable to fractionate 
natural gas into its various hydrocarbon components. 
Ethane, propane and butane (C2-C4) are commonly used as 
refrigerants for natural gas liquefaction in the so-called 
multicomponent or cascade refrigeration processes. 
Pentanes and heavier hydrocarbons generally have greater 
economic value as NGL's (natural gas liquids) for use in 
chemical feed stocks and gasoline. Fractionation 
processes typically involve cooling the natural gas to 
effect a partial condensation and feeding the partially 
condensed stream to a fractionation column commonly known 
as a scrub column. Methane is taken primarily in the 
overhead vapor and heavier components are removed 
primarily as a bottoms liquid. The bottoms are usually  
 
fractionated further into individual C2-C4 components for 
makeup gas in the LNG refrigeration system (e. g. 
multicomponent or cascade) and/or in order to make a 
liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) product. Typically, the 
scrub column employs either an overhead condensate reflux 
or a butane wash. In circumstances where removal of freezable 
hydrocarbons prior to natural gas liquefaction is the 
primary requirement, the prior art fails to recognize 
inefficiencies in scrubbing systems. For example, in 
liquid natural gas (LNG) plants employing liquid nitrogen 
as the primary refrigerant, or where C2-C4 refrigerants 
are already available from other sources, C2-C4 
fractionation may be unnecessary. Or, if the feed gas is 
very lean, fractionation may not be economical. The 
prior art processes for pretreating natural gas prior to 
liquefaction are not well-suited for such circumstances, 
are not energy efficient and incur excessive capital 
equipment costs. U. S. Patent 4,012,212 to Kniel describes a process 
for liquefying a hydrocarbon gas under a pressure greater 
than the critical pressure thereof wherein the gas is 
expanded to below the critical pressure and fed to a 
first

A method of pretreating a natural 
gas stream for liquefaction by removing freezable components, 

comprising the steps of: 

introducing a natural gas feed stream to a feed point on a 
scrub column having upper enriching and lower stripping 

sections; 
contacting the feed stream with a liquid reflux stream 
introduced to the upper section of the column to absorb C
