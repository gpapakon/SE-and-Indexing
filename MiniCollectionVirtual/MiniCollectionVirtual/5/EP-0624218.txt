<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a connection between components (10, 11), in particular shaped-section rods, gearwheels, etc., which are physically locked together laterally at their periphery by alternating tongues (15) and grooves (16). In order to design a connection of this kind so that the components connected together can rotate through angles of up to 360 DEG , the components (10, 11) are designed such that they can move relative to each other about parallel longitudinal axes (13, 14), the tongues (15) physically interlocking laterally in the grooves (16) to link the two together.

<CLAIMS>
Connection of structural elements (10 to 10", 
11 to 11
IV
), especially for profiled rods, gearwheels 
or the like, which roll on one another in a rotational 

manner and for this purpose mesh with one another at 
their peripheries in the manner of gearwheels by means 

of alternately arranged connecting tongues (15) and 
connecting grooves (16) which are of unchanging 

profile, wherein the elements are coupled against 
undesired radial separation by lateral shape-locking 

means, and wherein the connecting tongues (15) and 
connecting grooves (16) are relatively displaceable 

about the longitudinal axes (13, 14) of the structural 
elements which extend parallel to their periphery, 

characterised in that the undesired radial separation 
of the structural elements (10 to 10", 11 to 11
IV
) is 
prevented by the connecting tongues (15) and connecting 

grooves (16, 16') by them engaging in each other with 
undercuts as they roll upon each other. 
Connection according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the connecting tongues (15) have peripheral 

surfaces (30) which are capable of rolling movement 
provided over at least sections of their peripheries, 

and the connecting grooves (16, 16') have rolling 
surfaces (18) associated with said peripheral surfaces 

(30) and provided over at least sections of the 
grooves. 
Connection according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the peripheral surfaces (30) 

capable of rolling movement are provided on connecting 
tongues (15) shaped as mushroom heads and having 

elliptical-type crowning surfaces (17). 
Connection according to one or more of claims 1 
to 3, characterised in that the rolling surfaces (18)  

 
of the connecting grooves (16, 16') are of elliptical 

form. 
Connection according to one or more of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the outer peripheral 

surfaces (21) of two mushroom heads (19) which lie 
between the respective crowning surface edges (17') and 

the rolling surface edges (18') located on the mushroom 
stem (20) are in full surface-to-surface contact with 

each other in their position of mutual engagement. 
Connection according to one or more of claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the outer peripheral 

surfaces (21) of two mushroom heads (19) which lie 
between the respective crowning surface edges (17') and 

the rolling surface edges (18') located on the mushroom 
stem (20) are continuously curved. 
Connection according to one or more of claims 1 
to 5, characterised in that the spacing (a) between the 

crowning surfaces edges (17') of a connecting tongue 
(15) is approximately three times as great as the stem 

thickness (b) between the rolling surfaces (18) of 
adjacent connecting grooves (16). 
Connection according to one or more of claims 1 
to 6, characterised in that the structural elements 

(10, 10', 10", 11, 11') formed as profiled rods have 
fixing grooves (23) separate from the connecting 

grooves (16). 
Connection according to one or more of claims 1 
to 8, characterised in that the connecting tongues (15) 

and the connecting grooves (16) are provided 

distributed over 180Â° of the periphery of a structural 
element (10, 11) formed as a profiled rod. 
Connection according to one or more of claims

Connection according to one or more of claims 
1 to 10, characterised in that the structural elements

periphery, an equal size peripheral diameter as well as 

the same number of tongues and grooves. 
Connection according to claim 11, 
characterised in that at least one structural element

Connection according to one or more of claims 
1 to 10, characterised in that the one structural 

element (11" to 11
IV

than the other structural element (10) or is flat, and 

that two connecting tongues (15) of said other 
structural element (10) engage in a single larger 

connecting groove (16') of said one structural element
