<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed novel, solid, elastomeric block copolymers with improved resistance to cold flow wherein either 1) the terminal blocks are each a polymer (I polymer) of at least one conjugated diene (I), e.g., isoprene, which contains at least five carbon atoms with at least one of each pair of double-bonded carbon atoms in the polymerized diene I units being additionally single-bonded to two carbon atoms; at least one middle or interior block is a hydrogenated polybutadiene (B polymer); and at least one middle or interior block is an essentially straight chain polyethylene (E polymer) resulting from the hydrogenation of a polybutadiene composed of at least 80 % of 1,4- units; or 2) the terminal blocks are random copolymers resulting from the hydrogenation of a copolymer of at least one diene I as previously defined and hydrogenated butadiene, and at least one middle or interior block is a straight chain polyethylene (E polymer) as previously defined. The hydrogenated butadiene units in the B polymer or random IB polymer blocks are composed of no more than about 65 % of 1,4- units and at least about 35 % of 1,2- units. The foregoing block copolymers may be prepared by selectively hydrogenating substantially all the butadiene units of a precursor block, copolymer wherein the precursor blocks of the straight chain polyethylene block units are polybutadiene blocks in which at least about 80 % of the butadiene units are 1,4- units. A sufficient number of I units in the I polymer blocks or random IB copolymer blocks retain their unsaturation on selective hydrogenation to enable the vulcanization of the block copolymer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel, solid, 
elastomeric block copolymers having a degree of 
unsaturation sufficient for desired vulcanization or 
cross-linking, or other chemical modification, but not 
so high as to cause the copolymer to be susceptible to 
an undesirably large amount of oxidative, thermal or 
photolytic degradation, and also having improved 
resistance to cold flow and improved "green" strength 
before vulcanization. In accordance with this invention, novel, solid, 
elastomeric block copolymers with improved resistance 
to cold flow before vulcanization are provided wherein 
either 1) the terminal blocks are each a polymer, 
denoted as "I polymer", of at least one conjugated 
diene I, e.g., isoprene, which contains at least five 
carbon atoms with at least one of each pair of 
double-bonded carbon atoms in the diene I units in 
polymerized form being additionally single-bonded to 
two carbon atoms; at least one middle or interior block 
is a substantially hydrogenated polybutadiene, denoted 
as "B polymer", comprising 1,2- and 1,4- units as 
hereinafter defined; and at least one middle or 
interior block is an essentially straight polyethylene 
denoted as "E polymer", and resulting from the 
hydrogenation of a polybutadiene block comprising at 
least 80% of 1,4- units. The foregoing block copolymer 
contains, for example, 1 to 50 wt.% of I polymer 
blocks, from 49 to 98 wt.% of hydrogenated butadiene 
(B) polymer blocks, and from 1 to 30 wt.% of E polymer 
blocks, all based on the total weight of the block 
copolymer; or 2) the terminal blocks are each a random 
IB copolymer of at least one diene I and hydrogenated 
butadiene (B), both as previously defined, and at least 
one middle or interior block is an E polymer, as 
previously defined, such block copolymer comprising,  
 
for example, from 70 to 99 wt.% of random IB copolymer 
blocks, and 1 to 30 wt.% of E polymer blocks, all based 
on the total weight of block copolymer, with the I 
units being from 1 to 50 wt.% of each random IB 
copolymer block and the remainder being B units. The 
structure of the B or IB polymer blocks in both of the 
foregoing classes of block polymers contains sufficient 
branching such that after hydrogenation, these blocks 
contain no more than 10% of polyethylene 
crystallinity. This result is accomplished by 
introducing side branches into the butadiene or IB 
copolymer blocks, e.g., by controlling the 
microstructure of polymerized 1,3-butadiene. More 
particularly, the side branches are introduced into
