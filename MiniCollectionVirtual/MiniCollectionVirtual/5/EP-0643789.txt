<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a system and process for relining channel pipe sections with several hose-like inliners (2, 3 7). The internal hose-like inliner (2) of thermoplastic material has on its outside, e.g. a plurality of protuberances (4) as spacers for an external inliner (3). The inliners (2, 3, 7) are constructed in one piece and consist entirely or partly of HDPE and/or VLDPE. They are extremely flexible. The E modulus is preferably 30 to 900 N/mm
<
2
>
, the relative rigidity, i.e. the ration between the E modulus and the nominal diameter, is preferably 0.2 to 2.5 N/mm
<
3
>
. The invention proposes that first a preliner (3) and then the externally internal inliner (2) fitted with protuberances (4) be drawn into the channel (1) to be repaired. A quicksetting mortar (6) (sealant) is inserted into the annular chamber (5) between the preliner (3) and the inliner (2) defined by the protuberances (4) and allowed to set. In a preferred embodiment, a three-skinned system with an additional external inliner (7) is used, whereby the inside of the external inliner (7) or the outside of the central inliner (3) has short protuberances (8), so that an annular space (9) is formed to be used as an inspection chamber to permit inspection and subsequent repair.

System for relining conveyor ducts such as 
pipelines (1) 


having an inner tubular thermoplastic inliner 
(2), 
a second tubular thermoplastic inliner - 
termed hereinafter preliner (3) -, which is 

inserted into the pipeline to be restored, 
with the inner inliner (2) being inserted 
into the preliner (3) and having on its 

outside means (4) which serves both for 
fixing a defined clearance, and accordingly 

for formation of an annular chamber (5), 
between the internal inliner (2) and the 

preliner (3) and also for the form fitting 
anchoring of the internal inliner (2) in a 

hardenable composition to be introduced into 
the annular chamber (5). 
System according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 
between the tubular thermoplastic preliner (3) and the 

conveyor duct (1) to be restored there is provided a 
third tubular thermoplastic inliner (7), with the third 

inliner (7) having on its inside or the preliner (3) 
having on its outside means (8) for securing a 

clearance between the preliner (3) and the third 
inliner (7), whereby a free annular chamber (9) is 

formed between the preliner (3) and the third inliner 
as control chamber for the identification and possible 

elimination of leaks in one of the inliners. 
System according to one of claims 1 or 2, 

characterised by
 a metal foil (10) as diffusion or 
permeation barrier for chlorinated hydrocarbons etc in  

 
one of the inliners. 
System according to one of claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 knobs (4) are provided as means 
for fixing a defined distance between the inner inliner 

(2) and the preliner (3), with the knobs (4) having 
undercuts (11) and being connected in one piece with 

the inner inliner (2). 
System according to one of claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
 the inner inliner (2) consists of 

25 to 100% by wt.
of VLDPE with an E-modulus of 
30-300 N/mm², 
0 to 75% by wt.
of HDPE, 
0 to 5% by wt.
of fillers, pigments or 
auxiliary substances, 
0 to 5% by wt.
of other polymers
 
and that the inner inliner (2) has an E-modulus of 50-500 

N/mm². 
System according to one of claims 1 to 5, 

characterised by
 a ratio of E-modulus to nominal 
diameter of the inner inliner (2) of 0.25-1 N/mm³. 
System according to one of claims 4 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the inner inliner (2) has a wall 
thickness of 1.5 - 5 mm, an average nominal diameter of 

5 - 15 mm and a knob length of 8 - 20 mm. 
Method for the relining of conveyor ducts like 
pipelines (1), in which 


firstly an outer tubular thermoplastic 
inliner - denoted as preliner (3) hereinafter 

- is inserted into the pipeline (1) to be 
restored and 
then an inner tubular thermoplastic inliner  
 

(2) is inserted into the preliner (3), 
with the inner inliner (2) having on its 
outside means (4) for securing a defined 

clearance and accordingly forming an annular 
chamber (5) between the inner inliner (2) and 

the preliner (3), 
then the annular chamber (5) between the 
preliner (3) and the inner inliner (2) is 

filled with a hardenable composition (6), 
whereupon the hardenable composition is 
hardened to a solid tubular shell (12), in 

which the means (4) for fixing a defined 
clearance between the inner inliner (2) and 

the preliner (3) is anchored form-fittingly. 
Method according to claim 8, 
characterised in 
that,
before the insertion of the preliner (3) a 
further tubular thermoplastic inliner (7) is 

inserted into the pipeline (1) to be restored 
and

inside or the preliner (3) has on its outside 

means (8) for fixing a clearance between the 
preliner (3) and the further thermoplastic 

inliner (7), whereby a free annular chamber 
(9) is formed between the preliner (34) and

Method according to one of claims 9 or 10,

medium, or the like, as self-sealing layer arranged 

between two outer inliners (3, 7).
