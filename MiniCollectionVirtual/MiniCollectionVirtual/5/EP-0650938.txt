<ABSTRACT>
Transparent substrate (1), especially made of glass, on top of which there is a layer of metal nitride (3) intended to filter solar radiations, characterised in that, with a view to protecting the said layer of metal nitride, especially against high-temperature oxidation, this layer (3) has above it a layer (4) of pyrolysed metal oxide in which the metal has a standard free enthalpy of oxide formation delta G DEG  value lower than or equal at a given temperature to that of the metal of the nitride layer (3).
