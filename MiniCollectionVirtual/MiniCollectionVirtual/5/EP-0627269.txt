<ABSTRACT>
In a process for treating contaminated soils, sludges or the like, water is added to the materials to be treated and the contaminants contained in the water are separated off. To ensure particularly economical and effective treatment, the material is digested with water in a washing circuit and discharged in fractions, the fractions each being treated further in accordance with the grain size of their solids parts, and the washing water free of particles being recycled after the pollutants have been separated off.
