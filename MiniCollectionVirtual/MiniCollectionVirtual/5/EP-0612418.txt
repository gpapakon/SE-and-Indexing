<ABSTRACT>
An enlarging apparatus has a projection head (2), a projection table (3) and column (1) linking the projection head to the projection table. The column (1) has means (5) for detachably fastening it to a stationary beam and the projection head (2) is removably fastened in a fixed position to one end of the column, whereas the projection table (3) can be brought to a discrete number of predetermined positions on the column (1) at different distances from the projection head. This enlarging apparatus has the advantage of being easy to mount and to dismount at the workplace and of having parts that can be space-savingly stored when not in use. It thus satisfies the wish of the photo amateur for an apparatus with reduced space requirements.

<CLAIMS>
Photographic enlarger having a projection head (2), a 
projection stage (3) and a column (1) connecting the 

projection head to the projection stage, the column (1) 
having suitable means (5) for releasably fastening it to 

a fixed support, the projection head (2) being removably 
fastened in a fixed position to one end of the column, 

the projection stage (3) being attachable to the column 
at a discrete number of predetermined positions at 

different distances from the projection head, characterised 
in that the fastening means (5) comprise a 

clamping device (5) for quick fastening to a mounting 
plate (6), and the projection head (2) has a neck (11) 

which interlocks with the end of the column, and can be 
rigidly connected to the column by fitting the interlocking 

parts one into another. 
Enlarger according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the column (1) and the projection stage (3) have mutually 

complementary connection elements (14, 15, 16, 17, 18) 
for fastening the projection stage at different positions 

along the column. 
Enlarger according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the connection elements (14, 15, 16) of the column (1) 

comprise a central longitudinal slot (14) and a row of 
holes (16, 16'), on both sides of the slot, corresponding 

to the number of predetermined positions of the projection 
stage along the column. 
Enlarger according to claim 3, characterised in that 
the column (1) has a format scale (A) which assigns a  

 
picture format to individual holes (16, 16') of the rows 

of holes, the lengthening factor (shortening factor) for 
the exposure time when changing from one format to 

another being readable from a further scale (B). 
Enlarger according to any one of the preceding claims 
1 to 4, characterised in that the projection stage (3) is 

equipped with a mounting device (21) for interchangeable 
accessories such as enlarging frames, masking frames and 

the like. 
Enlarger according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the mounting device (21) comprises a mounting bracket 

(21) which can be attached to the projection stage (3) at 
lateral guides (19, 20) thereof.
