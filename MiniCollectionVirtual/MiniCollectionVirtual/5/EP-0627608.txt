<ABSTRACT>
An automatic rammer for artillery projectiles having a loading cradle (6) (which is arranged behind the weapon barrel (2) of the gun) and a displacement device for the projectile (1.1), which displacement device has a guide tube (4) which is arranged on the weapon barrel, parallel to the axis of the barrel bore, and on which a toothed rod (rack) (4.3) is arranged via which it can be displaced in the longitudinal direction (V1) by means of a first drive pinion (5.1). In the region behind the end of the weapon barrel, the guide tube (4) has a curved end section (4.1). This is curved forwards through a total of 180@ so that the end (4.2) of the end section (4.1) can pivot into the region immediately behind the loading cradle (6). A feed chain (3) is guided within the guide tube (4). This feed chain (3) is stiffly sprung and can be displaced in the guide tube (4) by means of a second drive pinion (5.2) in such a manner that its one end (3.1) moves out of the curved end section (4.2) of the guide tube (4), the front end (3.1) of the feed chain (3) being constructed as a displacement element.

An automatic rammer for artillery projectiles with a 
loading dish (6) arranged behind the gun barrel (2) of the 

gun, in which loading dish a projectile can be laid and which 
is aligned in the ramming position with the loading chamber of 

the gun barrel (2) and after the ramming procedure can be 
moved into an inoperative position where is does not impede 

the gun barrel return motion, and with a displacement device, 
which is driven by a motor and comprises a displacement 

element which acts upon the rear side of the projectile and 
is displaceable parallel to the gun bore axis, characterised 

in that the displacement device comprises a guide tube (4) 
which is arranged on the outside of the gun barrel (2) in the 

rear region thereof, extends parallel to the gun bore axis and 
is pivotable about an axis extending in the longitudinal 

direction, on which guide tube (4) a rack (4.3) is arranged, 
via which the guide tube is displaceable by means of a first 

drive pinion (5.1) parallel to its longitudinal axis and the 
rear end section (4.1) of the guide tube lying in the region 

behind the gun barrel end having a forward curvature extending 
through a total of 180°, the radius of curvature being 

selected in such a manner that the curved end section (4.2) of 
the guide tube (4) can be pivoted inwards into the region 

directly behind the loading dish (6) and a supply chain (3), 
which is non-resilient to longitudinal forces, is guided 

within the guide tube (4) and is displaceable by means of a 
second drive pinion (5.2) within the guide tube (4) in such a 

manner that one of its ends emerges from the curved end 
section (4.2) of the guide tube (4), the said front end (3.1) 

of the supply chain (3) being constructed as a displacement 
element, and the drive movement of the two drive pinions (5.1, 

5.2) is controlled in such a manner that, for the ramming 
procedure, the guide tube (4) is displaced forwards and the 

supply chain (3) is imparted with a displacement movement in 
the opposite direction to the guide tube (4), the velocity of  

 
said opposite movement being at least equal to the velocity of 

the displacement of the guide tube. 
A rammer according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the first and second drive pinions (5.1, 5.2) are driven by 

the same drive motor (5.3) and are arranged directly adjacent 
one another at the gun barrel end, the second drive pinion 

(5.2) engaging through a longitudinal slot provided in the 
guide tube (4). 
A rammer according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the guide tube (4) together with the 

drive motor (5.3) and the two drive pinions (5.1, 5.2) are 
constructed as a structural unit pivotable about an axis 

extending in the longitudinal direction. 
A rammer according to claim 3, characterised in that in 
an inoperative position the curved end section (4.1-4.2) of 

the guide tube (4) lies beneath the gun barrel end and can be 
pivoted inwards from this inoperative position through 

approximately 45° into the ramming position. 
A rammer according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the loading dish (6) comprises a 

longitudinal slot (6.1), through which the curved end section 
(4.2) of the guide tube (4) is guided during the displacement 

of the guide tube (4) when the loading dish (6) is in the 
ramming position and when the guide tube (4) has been pivoted 

inwards into the ramming position. 
A rammer according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the loading dish (6) is arranged on a 

telescopic guide (7), by means of which the loading dish is 
displaceable from an inoperative position in the region beyond 

the gun barrel return motion into the ramming position.
