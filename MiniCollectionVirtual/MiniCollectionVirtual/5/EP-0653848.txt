filed November 16, 1993, by D. Blaker, G. Ellard, M. Mobin and M. Thierbach, our 
docket number Blaker 5-5-5-9. This invention relates generally to digital signal processors, in general, 
and more particularly to digital signal processors implementing a Viterbi process. Mobile communication devices, such as mobile digital cellular 
telephones, often employ digital signal processors for processing and filtering 
received and transmitted digital signals. Often, a separate chip is provided to 
implement a Viterbi process for correcting errors in the incoming signals. 
Alternatively, a Viterbi process is encoded in software within the digital signal 
processor.  The Viterbi process is a maximum likelihood decoding process that 
provides forward error correction. The Viterbi process is used in decoding a 
sequence of encoded signals, such as a bit stream. The bit stream may represent 
encoded information in telecommunication system transmission through various 
media with each set of bits representing a symbol instant. In the decoding process, 
the Viterbi processor works back through a sequence of possible bit sequences at 
each symbol instant to determine which one bit sequence is most likely to have been 
transmitted. The possible transitions from a bit state at one
