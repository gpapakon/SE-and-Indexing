<ABSTRACT>
An improved process for recovery of precious metals such as gold or silver using novel ion exchnage resins having aryl guanidyl functionality from aryl guanidine compounds having a pKa at 25 DEG C less than 13 and preferably less than 12. The resins have improved elution properties compared to known guanidine reagents using caustic eluant solutions, particularly improved eluant solutions such as a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium benzoate. A selective elution of base metals may be carried out before elution of the precious metals from the resins having guanidyl functionality.

 RECOVERY OF PRECIOUS METALBackground of the InventionThis application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. application Serial No. 07/853,197 filed March 18, 1992 (Attorney Docket No. M5100/01 MIN) Field of the InventionThis invention relates to an improvement in the recovery of precious metals such as gold and silver and in particular to the recovery of gold from aqueous cyanide solutions thereof. The recovery is achieved by contact of the aqueous cyanide solution containing the precious metals, particularly gold, with an ion exchange resin containing a guanidine functionality. The guanidine reagent extracts the gold from the aqueous solution and the gold is then subsequently eluted or stripped from the guanidine reagent and recovered by conventional methods. The invention also relates to certain novel guanidine compounds which are suitable for extracting gold from cyanide solutions. 

Description of Related ArtGold occurs primarily as the native metal, alloyed with silver or other metals or as tellurides. It is commonly associated with the sulfides of iron, silver, arsenic, antimony and copper. Silver occurs as finely disseminated metal in rocks of hydrothermal origin as silver chloride, sulfide or tellurides and as complex sulfides with antimony and arsenic. Historical practice with ores containing native metal involves crushing, concentration of the gold or silver by gravity separation and recovery by amalgamation with mercury. Environmental concerns have resulted in abandonment of this process in most cases. Currently there are two major processes for recovery of gold and/or silver. The most widely accepted processes today involve leaching with caustic cyanide solution coupled with recovery of the metal values by concentration with zinc dust (Merrill-Crowe) or concentration of the gold and silver cyanide complexes by absorption on charcoal (carbon absorption scheme) also referred to as Carbon in Column (CIC) or Carbon in Pulp(CIP). A carbon process is also described in U.S. Patent 5,073,354 in which gold and silver also on activated carbon is stripped employing a caustic-benzoate strippent. Another process recently practiced in the Soviet Union is one in which quaternary amine ion exchange resins are employed as a replacement for charcoal in the carbon absorption scheme.
