<ABSTRACT>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a connector (1) for 
truss having a high shearing resistance and a superior safety in which 

the connector (1) can be inserted into and fixed in advance to the abutted 
surfaces of the structural members to be connected, adjustment of 

orientation of the connector is not needed, workability and installing 
workability can be remarkably improved and further the inserted and 

fixed connector can be prevented from being pulled when the connector is 
connected to the structural member. 
 
The connector (1) of the present invention includes the flat-plate like 
connecting plate (2), a hollow tubular member (3) having one end fixed to 

each of both surfaces of the connecting plate (2) and opened at the other 
end, a branch pipe engage part (7) communicated from a side of the 

tubular member (3) facing to the connecting plate up to the hollow part, a 
hollow branch pipe (8) having the engage part (9) removably engaged with 

the branch pipe engage part (7) formed at at least one end thereof, and a 
fixing hole (12) formed at a predetermined part of the connecting plate (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector for truss structure which is 
suitable for a connection of structural members in a wooden structure, 
in particular for a connection between the structural members in a truss 
structure. In recent years, there have been developed various kinds of 
structural laminated woods so as to apply some features of wood, 
artificially to improve the structural defects such as knots as found in 
natural materials and to get a heavy timber, long and large timber 
which is difficult to get from natural timber material. Along with this 
trend, it has been required to provide a connector for truss 
corresponding to a truss connection in the wooden structure. The prior art connector for truss will be described as follows. In the prior art, the connector for truss corresponding to the 
truss of the wooden structure has been used in such a manner that a bolt 
and nut are used for connecting the structural members to each other. For example, 1 ○ the gazette of Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. Hei 4-41831 
discloses a light-weight dome and a connector for the dome in 
which a pair of metallic connectors are welded in a radial spaced-apart 
relation to an outer circumference of a tube-like boss member, a wooden 
supporting member is held by a pair of metallic connectors and fastened 
and fixed with the bolts and nuts, and 2 ○ the gazette of Japanese U.M. 
Laid-Open No. Hei 4-13703 discloses a connector for connecting the  
 
wooden truss members by a method wherein an end surface of the wooden 
member is punched with a bolt embedding hole, a bolt is embedded into 
the bolt embedding hole, the bolt is integrally fixed to the wooden 
member with the adhesive agent and the bolt is fastened to a connector 
fitting with nut. However, in the aforesaid prior art configuration, in particular 1 ○ 
had some problems that many parts such as bolts, nuts and washers were 
required for connecting the structural members, fixing work for the 
structural members was troublesome and its workability was lacked. In 
addition, the prior art had other problems that the fitting was large 
in size, its transporting characteristic was not satisfactory, and in 
particular its working at a high-elevated location was lack of safety. Additionally, the prior art structure in which the wooden 
supporting members were fastened and fixed with bolts and nuts had some 
problems that its fastening force is lost in several years due to 
shrinkage of the wooden material to cause a certain looseness to be 
easily generated
