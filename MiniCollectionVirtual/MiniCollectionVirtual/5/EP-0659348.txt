<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for transferring an element of a moulding assembly in an operation for moulding small articles, permitting the vertical taking hold of and setting down of a first mechanical piece, a countermould (20), which is complementary to and separable from a second mechanical piece containing the first piece, a master mould (36), the said pieces constituting a moulding assembly. The device comprises:     means for clamping the countermoulds (20) without play, means for blocking the countermoulds in a horizontal position at one and the same level independently of the curvature of the mould plates, means for rapid ejection of the countermoulds when they are set down, and fixed means for guiding the countermoulds on their return to the washing station at a distance from the master moulds.

Device for transferring a component of a moulding
assembly in an operation for moulding small articles,

making possible the vertical picking up and replacing of a
first mechanical piece, which constitutes a countermould,

complementary to and separable from a second mechanical
piece containing the first piece, which constitutes a main

mould, the said pieces constituting a moulding assembly,
characterised in that it comprises:


at least one moulding assembly of this type, means (1) for
gripping the countermoulds (20) without play,
means (6) for locking the countermoulds (20) in the
horizontal position on the same level independently of the

curvature of the mould plates,
means (10) for rapidly ejecting the countermoulds when they
are removed, and fixed means (35) for guiding the

countermoulds returning to the washing station at a
distance from the main moulds,
and in that the countermoulds (20) comprise studs (21),
which cooperate with means for gripping, locking, ejection

and guiding.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
gripping means (1) comprise a bar (2), the substantially

vertical flat inner face (13) of which constitutes the
fixed clamp of a gripper (1),


a flat jaw (16) constituting the pivoting clamp of the said
gripper (1), articulated on a counter-bar (3) about a

horizontal shaft (14) passing through the said counter-bar
(3), the bar (2) and counter-bar (3) defining clear spaces

(4) between struts (5) connecting them, an angled lever
(15) fixed to the jaw (16) and equipped with a return 

spring (17) to hold the jaw (16) against the fixed clamp in
the extraction position, the said lever (15) acting against

the return spring (17) to open the gripper (1) in the
removal position.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
locking means consist of a rigid frame (6) fixed to the bar

(2), supporting vertical pushers (7) on compression
springs (10),


serving as stops against the top end of the studs (21) of
the countermould (20), the said pushers (7) cooperating

with notches (24) on the studs (21) and with the jaw (16)
to hold the countermould (20) without any degree of freedom

both vertically and horizontally.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
studs (21) are provided with at least one flat vertical

part, with at least one sliding slope (25) and at least one
stopping counter-slope (26), the slope (25) and counterslope

(26) defining a profiled notch (24) which cooperates
with the jaw (16) to press the countermould (20) against

the inner face (13) of the extraction bar (2).
Device according to Claims 1 and 4, characterised in
that the studs (21) are provided with two flat vertical

parts (23) and two notches (24) disposed back to back.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that
means for rapidly ejecting the countermoulds (20) when they

are removed during the opening of the gripper (1) result
from the combined effects of the disengagement of the jaw

(16) from the notches (24) and from the expansion of the
compression springs (10) acting on the stops, which has the

consequence of driving the studs (21) downwards.
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
fixed means (35,35') for guiding the countermoulds (20) 

returning to the washing station at a distance from the
main moulds (36) consist of fixed runners (35) situated

under the return run of the first chain and positioned
between the studs (21).
Device according to Claim 7, characterised in that the
fixed guiding means (35') are positioned outside the studs

(21) and cooperate with notches, snugs or shoulders (34')
fixed on the studs (21) towards the outside.
