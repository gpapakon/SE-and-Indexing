<ABSTRACT>
A combustor (4) for a gas turbine having an air 
inlet that forms two passages (90,92), each of which has a 

circumferential array of individually rotatable swirl vanes 
(84,86). The swirl vanes are mounted on axially oriented 

primary fuel pegs (72) that extend through the air inlet 
passages. The middle and outer liners form an outer 

annular passage in which radially oriented secondary fuel 
pegs (62) are disposed. The middle and inner liners form 

an inner annular passage that is supplied with cooling air. 
A perforated circumferentially extending baffle is locating 

in the inner annular passage and directs the cooling air to 
flow over the inner liner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a combustor for
burning fuel in compressed air. More specifically, the
present invention relates to a low NOx combustor for a gas
turbine.In a gas turbine, fuel is burned in compressed
air, produced by a compressor, in one or more combustors.
Traditionally, such combustors had a primary combustion
zone in which an approximately stoichiometric mixture of
fuel and air was formed and burned in a diffusion type
combustion process. Additional air was introduced into the
combustor downstream of the primary combustion zone.
Although the overall fuel/air ratio was considerably less
than stoichiometric, the fuel/air mixture was readily
ignited at start-up and good flame stability was achieved
over a wide range in firing temperatures due to the locally
richer nature of the fuel/air mixture in the primary
combustion zone.Unfortunately, use of such approximately stoichiometric
fuel/air mixtures resulted in very high temperatures
in the primary combustion zone. Such high temperatures
promoted the formation of oxides of nitrogen ("NOx"),
considered an atmospheric pollutant. It is known that
combustion at lean fuel/air ratios reduces NOx formation.
However, achieving such lean mixtures requires that the
fuel be widely distributed and very well mixed into the
combustion air. This can be accomplished by introducing
the fuel into both primary and secondary annular air inlets 
using, in the case of gas fuel, fuel spray tubes distributed
around the circumference of the annulus.It has been found that mixing of the fuel and air
is enhanced by using separate passages to divide the air in
the primary air inlet into two streams. Radial swirlers,
comprised of a number of swirl vanes distributed around the
circumference of these passages, impart a swirl angle to
the air that aids in the mixing of the fuel and air. The
swirlers in each primary inlet passage are opposite handed
so that the air exiting from the pre-mixing zone has little
net swirl angle. Such a combustor is disclosed in "Industrial
RB211 Dry Low Emission Combustion" by J. Willis et
al., American Society of Mechanical Engineers (May 1993).Unfortunately, such combustors suffer from a
variety of drawbacks. First, the swirl vanes are integrally
cast into a primary air inlet assembly, making it
impossible to change the swirl angle once the combustor has
been built. This makes it difficult to optimize the swirl
conditions since it is not possible for the combustor
designer to predict in advance the specific swirl angle
that should be
