<ABSTRACT>
A column band pattern memory (10) stores six 
different column band patterns "SML, SLM, MSL, MLS, LSM, 

and LMS" obtained by re-arranging three different area 
modulation ranks (L, M, and S). A column band pattern 

generator (12) irregularly selects one of the column 
band patterns stored in the column band pattern memory 

(10) on the basis of a numerical value generated by a 
random number generator (11). The selected column band 

pattern is input to a dot area determination unit (13), 
and dot areas in units of columns are determined on the 

basis of the order of dot area modulation ranks (e.g., 
the order of S, M, and L) in the selected column band 

pattern. A pulse controller (14) performs pulse control 
to form dots in accordance with the dot areas determined 

by the dot area determination unit (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording
apparatus for recording an image by drawing dots on a
recording medium and, more particularly, to a recording
apparatus which can achieve high image quality.Recording apparatuses arranged in a printer, a
copying machine, a facsimile apparatus, and the like
record an image consisting of a dot pattern on a
recording medium such as a paper sheet, a resin thin
plate, or the like on the basis of input image
information. Such recording apparatuses can be
classified into a wire-dot system, a thermal transfer
system, a thermal recording system, an ink-jet system,
an electrophotography system, and the like depending on
their recording methods. In recent years, of these
systems, the thermal transfer system and the ink-jet
system are used in many recording apparatuses since they
can realize high resolution with low cost.A recording apparatus of the above-mentioned sort
forms dots (a to h) using a recording head 1 on which
recording elements (A to H) having image forming
portions, as shown in Fig. 33. This operation is
repeated upon recording scanning (main scanning) of the
recording head 1, and each of the recording elements 
further forms a plurality of dots ((1) to (5) in Fig.
33), thereby recording an image.However, since the above-mentioned recording
apparatus uses a plurality of recording elements, a
variation in dot area, a variation in dot formation
position, and the like occur depending on the recording
elements. For this reason, upon recording of image
information which requires uniform dot areas and a
uniform dot arrangement, a stripe-shaped nonuniformity
is generated. This phenomenon will be described below
with reference to Figs. 34 to 36.Fig. 34 shows an ideal state of a recorded image
obtained by recording dots with uniform areas at
accurate positions on the basis of basic 50%-halftone
image information. Fig. 35 shows a 50%-halftone
recorded image obtained when the area of each of dots in
a line c recorded by the recording element C is larger
than a standard area, and the area of each of dots in a
line f recorded by the recording element F is smaller
than the standard area. The image constituted by such
dots becomes darker near the line c, and also becomes
lighter near the line f. Since this phenomenon
continuously occurs, a stripe-shaped nonuniformity
(banding) is generated in the recorded image.A 50%-halftone recorded image shown in Fig. 36 has
uniform dot areas recorded by all the recording elements 
(A to H). However, dots in a line b recorded by the
