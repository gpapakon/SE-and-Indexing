<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new belt
tensioning system and to a new belt tensioner
therefor as well as to new methods of making such a
new belt tensioning system and such a new belt
tensioner.It is known from US-A-5 190 502 to Gardner et al to provide a belt tensioning
system comprising a support means
having an abutment means, an endless transmission
belt construction carried by the support means and
arranged to move in a certain path relative to the
support means, an arm pivotally mounted to the
support means, a pulley rotatably carried by the
arm and being in engagement with the belt 
construction, and a wound coiled spring having
opposed ends, one of which is operatively
interconnected to the abutment means of the support
means and the other of which is operatively
interconnected to the arm, whereby the force of the
wound coiled spring tends to pivot the arm in a
direction that urges the pulley against the belt
construction with a force that tensions the belt
construction, the arm having a shoulder means for
being engaged by the one of the opposed ends of the
wound coiled spring by the force of the wound
coiled spring so as to permit removal of the arm
and the wound coiled spring as a self-contained
unit from the support means when the arm is pivoted
to a certain position where the shoulder means of
the arm engages the one end of the wound coiled
spring and effectively moves the one end of the
wound coiled spring out of contact with the
abutment means of the support means, the wound
coiled spring comprising a helical spring having
the opposed ends thereof comprising an inner end
and an outer end, the one end of the wound coiled
spring comprising the inner end thereof.It is one of the features of the present
invention as claimed in claim 1, to provide a belt tensioning system of
US-A-5,190,502, which is characterized 
in that said one end of said wound coiled spring
comprises said outer end thereof, and wherein
said shoulder means is initially separate from
said arm and has been attached thereto after
said spring has been wound on said arm to
a predetermined condition thereof. Accordingly, it is an object of this
invention to provide a new belt tensioning system
having one or more of the novel features of this
invention as set forth above or hereinafter shown
or described.Another object of this invention is to
provide a new method of making such a belt
tensioning system, as claimed in claim 12 which
mentions a combination of steps known
from the above US-A-5 190 502 to Gardner
et al, and which is
