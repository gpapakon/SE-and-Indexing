<ABSTRACT>
The cages are designed as disc cages (12), guided in a circular groove (13) positioned at the inner or the outer ball race (4.1,4.2,7.1,7.2). They are equipped with several pockets (23), positioned along the inner or outer edge of the disc for the accommodation of the cylindrical rollers (11). One of the ball races is divided into segments, kept together after the insertion of the cages, by holding elements (17). The wheel-set bearing (1) is protected by a cap (38) on one side and has a ring seal (37) at the opposite side.

<CLAIMS>
Axlebox bearing (1, 18) for rail vehicles, said bearing consisting of two
cylindrical rollers (11) arranged next to each other and guided in cages for

rolling on associated raceways (9, 10) of an inner (7, 19) and an outer race
ring (4, 20), said axlebox bearing (1, 18) comprising a centre flange (6) and

outer flanges, 
characterised in that
 the cages are configured as one-piece
disk cages (12) that are guided for free rotation in an annular groove (13) of

the inner (7, 19) or the outer race ring (4, 20) and comprise a plurality of
pockets (23) arranged in spaced relationship on the entire periphery on their

outer or inner diameter for receiving cylindrical rollers (11), the inner (7, 19)
or the outer ring (4, 20) is split and held together by retaining elements (17)

after the insertion of the cages (12).
Axlebox bearing (1, 18) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
, in the
region of the webs (26), the cages (12) comprise axial lubricant penetration

bores (14) that communicate with radial lubricant penetration bores (15) that
end on the inner or the outer diameter of the cage (12).
Axlebox bearing (1, 18) according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the axial
lubricant penetration bores (14) increase in diameter.
Axlebox bearing (1, 18) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the cage
(12) is made of a metal or a metal alloy, for example, of steel or brass, and

fabricated by punching.
Axlebox bearing (1, 18) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the cage
(12) is made of a plastic material and manufactured by injection moulding. 
Axlebox bearing (1) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the outer
race ring (4) is made up of two adjoining race rings (4.1, 4.2) that are

provided with outer flanges (5) so that a centre flange (6) is formed, both race
rings (4.1, 4.2) are split and each comprises an annular groove (13) for

receiving the disk cage (12), the inner race ring (7) being formed by two
adjoining inner race rings (7.1, 7.2) each of which is provided with an outer

flange (8).
Axlebox bearing (18) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the outer
race ring (20) has a tripartite configuration in which a central ring part (21)

having a centre flange (6) is connected on each side by the retaining
elements (17) to an outer race ring part (22) comprising an outer flange (5),

and, between the central ring part (21) and each outer race ring part (22), an
annular groove (13) is formed for receiving the disk cages (12).
Axlebox bearing (18) according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the inner
race ring (19) comprises two outer flanges (8), one of these flanges (8) being

constituted by a separate stop disk
Axlebox bearing (1, 18) according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 at least
the raceways (9, 10) are provided with an anti-corrosion coating of a galvanic

zinc alloy, the anti-corrosion coating having a thickness that, with a value of
0.1 to 3.0 Âµm, is in the order of magnitude of the surface roughness of the

rolling bearing component.
Axlebox bearing (1, 18) according to claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the
galvanic zinc alloy is a zinc iron alloy or a zinc nickel alloy and is chromated.
