<ABSTRACT>
Nestable shopping trolley (1) having an underframe (2) which is equipped with castors (3) and supports a basket (18), which tapers in the direction of pushing. A rack (20) which can be moved from an out-of-use position into a rearward use position and vice versa, comprises a pivoting part (21) and a depositing part (32) and is intended for the depositing of relatively large objects, is provided at that end of the shopping trolley (1) which is assigned to the pushing device, and at its rear end (33) the rack has at least one stop (36) for the further support of the objects. The depositing part (32), which is connected movably to the pivoting part (21), is equipped with supporting means (35) which are supported in at least one guide (13), which is arranged on the underframe (2) and extends in the direction of pushing of the shopping trolley (1), and the depositing part (32) is further supported by way of a cross stay (24) belonging to the pivoting part (21). The pivoting part (21), which is arranged on the underframe (2), can be pivoted about a horizontal axis (22) and can be mounted in a manner which allows it to be raised up and lowered to a limited extent. The cross stay (24) of the pivoting part (21) is arranged either on the underside (39) or on the top side (40) of the depositing part (32).
