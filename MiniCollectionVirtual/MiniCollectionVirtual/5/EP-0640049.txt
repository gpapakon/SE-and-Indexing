<ABSTRACT>
A modular cab/sleeper structural assembly (31) for a truck-tractor vehicle (30) is provided which improves ride quality and structural integrity without substantially increasing the overall weight or sacrificing any advantages of separate cab and sleeper units. The assembly (31) includes a chassis frame (33) extending substantially longitudinal of the vehicle (30) and a cab unit (35) having a cab structural assembly (37) mounted to the chassis frame (33) by a first mount (42). A sleeper unit (38) having a sleeper structural assembly (40) is mounted to the chassis frame (33) by a second mount (43). A coupling member (41), coupled between the cab structural assembly (37) and the sleeper structural assembly (40) and independent of the chassis frame (33), rigidly couples the sleeper structural assembly (40) and the cab structural assembly (37) together to produce a substantially unified composite structure for increased structural integrity. A method for improving ride quality and structural integrity of the modular cab/sleeper structural assembly (31) is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, generally, to truck-tractor vehicles and, more particularly,
to truck-tractor vehicles having sleeper box units.Traditionally, long-haul truck-tractor vehicles 10, examples of which are depicted in
Figures 1 to 3, are configured with sleeper units 11 which provide sleeping
accommodation for truck operators during long hauls. Vehicle 10, 10' or 10'' is operated
from a cab unit 12, 12' or 12'' (i.e., the driving compartment) which is positioned forward
of sleeper unit 11, 11' or 11''. Generally, these cab and sleeper assemblies are
constructed as either a structurally integral cab and sleeper assembly 14' (Figure 2) or as
separate cab and sleeper units 14 and 14'' (Figures 1 and 3).Separate cab and sleeper assemblies 14 and 14'', are highly desirable since these
configurations are capable of being constructed independent of one another which fosters
configuration flexibility. Thus, these units are capable of different cab and sleeper
configurations to suit customer needs. The sleeper unit 11, for example, may be
purchased in a variety of lengths, heights, compartment layouts or the like. By 
comparison, the highly tooled cab unit 12 may remain
unchanged and mounted to chassis frame 15.Sleeper unit 11 is generally mounted to chassis frame
member 15 at three discrete mounts 16. Chassis frame
member 15, briefly, includes two longitudinally
extending beams 25 positioned in a side-by-side spaced-apart
relation which are coupled together by a
plurality of transversely positioned cross-beams 26.
Typically, two transversely spaced-apart front rubber
mounts 16 coupled sleeper unit 11 to each longitudinal
beam 25, respectively. A single rear rubber mount 16
positioned intermediate a rear portion of sleeper mount
11 and mounted to one cross-beam 26.Cab unit 12 (i.e., the driving compartment) is
positioned forward of sleeper unit 11 and is similarly
mounted to chassis frame member 15 at three discrete
mounts 16 which provide limited isolation from chassis
frame member 15. To access sleeper unit 11 from cab
unit 12, aligned ports or openings (not shown) are
provided which extend through both cab rear wall 17 and
the adjacent sleeper front wall 18. A rubber boot 19
spans the interface between cab unit 12 and sleeper
unit 11 to seal assembly 14 and to provide weather
protection.This arrangement affords other benefits as well.
Because sleeper unit 11 is often taller and wider than
adjacent cab unit 12, crash damage during frontal
impacts, roll-overs or jack-knifes is more confined to
sleeper
