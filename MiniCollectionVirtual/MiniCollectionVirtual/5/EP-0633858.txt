<ABSTRACT>
A container (1) and closure (8) combination wherein the closure comprises a skirt portion (10) the periphery of which has at least one rounded ramped portion adapted to cooperate with one or more corresponding rounded ramped portions (11a) on the container such that relative axial rotation of the container causes cooperation of the ramped portions and disengagement of the closure from the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to containers and closures therefor, and especially to a 
container/closure combination wherein the closure is removed from the container by 
a rotational movement followed by an axial movement. GB 2,063,226 describes a closure and container combination wherein the 
closure is provided internally with a plurality of projections of equal circumferential 
length spaced apart by equal circumferential distances and the container is provided 
around its neck with a plurality of projections defining spaced slots therebetween, 
which slots have a circumferential length and are so positioned that the projections 
on the closure may pass through the slots on the container neck, or a skirt of the 
closure and the container neck being shaped such that contact between the said skirt 
and the container neck when the container and closure are at selected relative 
rotational positions thereof causes the said skirt of the closure to be temporarily 
deformed whereby the projections on the closure are urged through the slots on the 
container neck. GB 1471367 describes a container and closure combination comprising a 
container having a rigid neck terminating in an annular bead provided with an upper 
sealing surface and an annular shoulder surface arranged substantially parallel to the 
upper sealing surface and facing downwardly away from the latter, the shoulder 
surface extending laterally inwardly towards a bore in the said neck, said neck 
being provided with peripheral bulges, said bulges being substantially crescent-shaped 
viewed from the end of the neck; and a closure having a rigid end portion 
and a resilient skirt, said skirt being provided with inside hooks engaged with the 
shoulder surface of said bead and with inner lugs adapted to engage the peripheral 
bulges on relative rotation of said closure and said container. GB 1260128 discloses a container and closure combination comprising a 
container with an upstanding cylindrical neck provided with a cam surface. The 
closure comprises an outer skirt portion, within which there is an inner skirt portion 
having a cam surface which engages the cam surface on the neck when the container 
and closure are relatively rotated, to force the closure off the container. According to the present invention there is provided a container and closure 
combination as defined in claim 1. The cross-sectional shape of the container and hence of the substantially 
conforming closure at the point where the periphery of the skirt of the closure meets 
the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A container (1) and closure (8) combination, the closure (8) being 
made of a resilient material, the closure (8) and container (1) being able to rotate 

relative to each other about a container mouth - base axis, the closure (8) 
comprising an outer skirt portion (10) the periphery of which substantially conforms 

to the cross section of the container (1) at the points where the periphery (11) of the 
skirt portion (8) meets the container (1), the cross sectional shape at the said point 

being substantially oval or obloid, 
characterised
 in that there is at least one rounded 
ramp portion (11a) situated at the periphery (11) of the said outer skirt portion (10) 

adapted to cooperate with one or more corresponding rounded ramped portions (6a) 
on the container such that, relative axial rotation of the closure (8) and container (1) 

results in co-operation of the respective ramped portions (11a, 6a) on the periphery 
(11) of the skirt portion (10) and container (1) and a consequential relative axial 

movement of the closure (8) and container (1) such as to cause disengagement of the 
closure (8) from the container (1). 
A container (1) and closure (8) combination according to claim 1 

characterised
 in that the cross sectional shape is substantially oval but with flattened 
end faces substantially parallel to the minor axis of the oval. 
A container (1) and closure (8) combination according to claim 2 

characterised
 in that the cross-sectional shape is oval having minor and major axis 
lengths in the ratio 1 : 1.2 - 1.5, suitably about 1 : 1.33. 
A container (1) and closure (8) combination according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3 
characterised
 in that the ramped portion(s) on the periphery (11) of 
the skirt portion (10) of the closure (8) is/are provided by a skirt portion (10) 

having a scalloped periphery (11), and the corresponding ramped portion(s) on the 
container is/are provided by a ledge or shelf portion (6) integrally formed as a 

moulding of the container (1), of corresponding scalloped shape, such that when the 
closure (8) is in place on the container (1) the convex portions of the periphery (11) 

of the closure (8) intermesh with corresponding concave portions of the ledge or 
shelf (6) and 
vice versa
 such that relative axial rotation of the closure (8) and 
container (1) causes the convex portions of the scalloped periphery of the closure 

(8) to ride up the curve of the concave portions of the scalloped portion of the 
container (1), thereby functioning as co-operating ramp portions.  

 
A container (1) and closure (8) combination according to claim 5 


characterised
 in that the scalloped periphery (11) of the skirt portion (10) of the 
closure (8) has two convex portions (11a) and two concave portions (11b), a 

corresponding portion (6a, 6b) being formed on the container (1). 
A container (1) and closure (8) combination according to claim 5 

characterised
 in that the convex portions (11a, 6b) are formed so that the peaks are 
positioned opposite each other and bisected by the minor axis of the oval, with a 

corresponding ledge or shelf portion being formed on the container (1). 
A container (1) and closure (8) combination according to any one of 
claims 1 to 6 
characterised
 in that the closure (8) has a closure face (9) which when 
the closure is in place on the container seals the opening (5) of the container. 
A container (1) and closure combination according to any one of claims 1 
to 7 
characterised
 in that the engagement of the closure (8) with the container (1) is 
achieved by a 'snap-fit' mechanism. 
A container (1) and closure (8) combination according to claim 8 

characterised
 in that the 'snap-fit' is provided by a whole or segmented annular 
bead (7) around the neck of the mouth opening (5) of the container (1) and 

corresponding internal resilient lugs (13) on the closure (8) which snap over the 
bead (7).
