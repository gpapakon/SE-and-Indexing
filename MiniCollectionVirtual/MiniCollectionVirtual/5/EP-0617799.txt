<ABSTRACT>
A method for 3 dimensional, one pass migration of post stack seismic data is implemented on a massively parallel computer. The quality of the migration and speed of execution makes possible iterative 3D post stack depth migrations. The depth migration method computes in the frequency domain and downward continues one or more frequency planes through all depth levels of interest. For a single frequency, at each depth level, the method extrapolates a shifted position for each x, y position by applying a filter for 2D convolution. A processing component is assigned to each subgrid of x, y spatial positions and the processing components operate concurrently in parallel to determine filter coefficients independently for each x, y spatial position and to extrapolate the x, y shifted positions. The filter coefficients are derived independently at each x, y position by storing a limited table of filter coefficients in local memory of each processing component.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of seismic data 
processing, and in particular to a method for migrating seismic data 
using a massively parallel computer. The Earth's subsurface can be imaged by a seismic survey, 
therefore, seismic data acquisition and processing are key 
components in geophysical exploration. In a seismic survey, elastic 
acoustic waves are generated by a source at the Earth's surface and 
the waves are radiated into the Earth's subsurface. For land seismic 
surveys. the usual source is dynamite or a seismic vibrator, while for 
a marine seismic survey the source is typically an airgun array. As the waves radiate downward through the Earth's 
subsurface, they reflect and propagate upwards towards the surface 
whenever the subsurface medium changes. The upward reflections 
are detected by a number of receivers and the reflected data 
recorded and processed in order to image the subsurface. 
Interpretation of these acoustic images of the subsurface formation 
leads to the structural description of the subsurface geological 
features, such as faults, salt domes, anticlines, or other features 
indicative of hydrocarbon traps. While two dimensional ("2D") seismic surveys have been 
conducted since the 1920's, three dimensional ("3D") seismic 
surveys have only recently become widely used. 3D surveys more 
accurately reflect the subsurface positions of the hydrocarbon traps, 
but are expensive and time consuming to acquire and process. For 
an offshore 3D data set covering a 20 x 20 km area, it costs about 
$3M dollars (1991 dollars) to acquire the data with another $1 M 
dollars for data processing to transform the raw data into useable 
images. Because the cost of such a seismic survey is considerably 
less than the cost of drilling an offshore oil well, 3D seismic surveys 
are often worth the investment. Although 3D marine surveys vary widely in size (1,000 to 
100,000 km²), a typical marine survey might generate in excess of  
 
40,000 data acquisition tapes. Data is accumulated at a staggering 
rate, about 1.5 million data samples every 10 seconds. A significant 
amount of time and money is spent in processing this enormous 
amount of data. The result of the seismic survey is thus an enormous amount 
of raw data indicative of reflected signals which are a function of 
travel time, propagation, and reflection affects. The goal is to 
present the reflected amplitudes as a function of lateral position 
and depth. A typical marine seismic survey goes through three distinct 
sequ
