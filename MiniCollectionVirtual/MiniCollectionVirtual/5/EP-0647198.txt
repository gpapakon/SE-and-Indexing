<ABSTRACT>
A bundling-up device for container sets comprises a membrane (2) made of plastic material and defined by a tubular band adapted to wrap and tighten a predetermined number of containers (3) disposed in side by side relation, at side portions thereof, as well as a carrying handle (4) for handling the unitary container set.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi container package, in particular of beverage containers, into a 
unitary set. It is known that bundling-up or association of 
containers into unitary packages, in particular 
beverage containers such as bottles, cans, jars, is 
presently carried out by packaging elements or 
"clusters" made of injected or thermoformed plastics or 
paperboard material generally decorated in advance. In particular, for packaging 1 litre and bigger bottles 
into a unitary set, a heat-shrinkable plastics membrane 
or film is used, a support handle being formed therein 
or added thereto, which handle is for example made of a 
strip surrounding the unitary set and passing under it. In some packages, in addition to plastics membranes, 
the use of paperboard holding bowls into which the 
container bottoms are introduced, is also provided. However, the known bundling-up technique as briefly 
described above has some limits and inconveniences. In fact, in case of packages completely or partly made 
of paperboard material, not only possible wear of the 
material due for example to dampness and to the weight 
of the material itself may occur, but also 
manufacturing costs to be borne are rather high. As regards packages made of heat-shrunk film, in 
addition to the important amount of material needed for  
 
each unitary set, a non negligible energy consumption is 
also required due to the heat workings for applying the 
film. Furthermore, inscriptions or messages, such as 
advertisements, cannot be put on said heat-shrunk films, 
as, on the one hand, they would be deformed due to the 
material shrinkage during the packaging process and, on 
the other hand, it would be difficult to position them 
properly on the packages. It is also known from document US n. 4269314 a multi 
container package consisting of two six-packs of 
cylindrical cans joined together by means of a 
circumferential elastic band provided with a handle 
strap connected only to the outer surface of said 
elastic band. Under this situation, the technical task underlying the 
present invention is to devise a bundling-up device 
capable of substantially obviating the above drawbacks. Within the scope of this technical task, it is an 
important object of the invention to provide a bundling-up 
device which is not only pratical and reliable, but 
also very economic both as regards the device itself and 
the operating steps necessary to set it up. Another important object of the invention is to provide 
a bundling-up device

<CLAIMS>
A multi container package, in particular for 
beverage containers, 

comprising: 

a membrane (2) defined by a tubular band of elastically 
extensible plastic material adapted to wrap and tighten 

said containers (3) disposed in side by side relation in 
a predetermined number at side portions thereof; and 
a carrying handle (4) for handling said unitary set, 
said carrying handle presenting a central handgrip 

portion (5b), and end portions (5a) linked to said 
tubular band at symmetrically opposite areas thereof, 
 
characterized in that said end portions are also linked 

to the respective containers disposed at positions adjacent the handle 
in said package. 
A package according to claim 1, wherein said carrying 
handle (4) comprises an adhesive tape (5).  

 
A package according to claim 2, 

characterized in that said carrying handle (4) further 
comprises a ribbon (6) made of paperboard or other 

material engaged to said adhesive tape (5) at said 
central portion (5b). 
A package according to claim 1, 
characterized in that 

said carrying handle (4) is embodied by a 
support element (9) provided with a plurality of 

attachment seats (10) spaced apart from each other 
according to pitches corresponding to the distances 

between the axes of said containers disposed in the unitary 
set, each of said attachment seats (10) comprising a 

collar-shaped portion insertable on the neck of a 
respective bottle and provided with a locating 

protuberance (12) adapted to rest against an abutment  
 

area projecting from the container neck. 
A package according to claim 4, 
characterized in that said locating protuberance (12) is 

defined by flexible tabs facing the inside of the 
opening (13) defined by said collar-shaped portion. 
A package according to claim 1, 
characterized in that it comprises at least one 

auxiliary locking element engaging said tubular band (2) 
to at least one container (3) of said unitary set. 
A package according to claim 6, 
characterized in that said auxiliary locking element is 

embodied by at least one adhesive label (7) or one 
length of adhesive tape exhibiting one portion (7a) 

engaged to said tubular band (2) and a second portion 
(7b) engaged to said container (3). 
A package according to claim 6, 
characterized in that said auxiliary locking element is 

embodied by an auxiliary adhesive tape (8) disposed 
under the bottom of at least one container (3) of said 

unitary set and applied at both ends to said tubular 
band (2), at symmetrically opposite positions, so as to 

define a substantially U-shaped staple.
