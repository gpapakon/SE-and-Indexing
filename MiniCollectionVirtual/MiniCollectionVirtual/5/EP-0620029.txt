<ABSTRACT>
The support bearing (A) and sole holder (B) can alter their reciprocal position along the ski (Sk) lengthwise axis. The support bearing has a support element (St) cooperating with a tension element (3). The sole holder has a holder element (6) which is secured on the ski top surface and tilting on a transverse axis, gripping the ski-boot toe. The tread plate upper side has at least one protuberance (5).

Front sole-retaining device of a ski binding for a ski boot (St) having a
sole (So) jutting out in the front toe region, which can selectively be

used both for touring and for downhill skiing, comprising

a support bearing (A) for supporting the front region only of the ski
boot (St) from below, which includes a bearing axis (1) mountable upon

the ski (Sk) spaced from its surface and extending paralel thereto and
perpendicular to its longitudinal axis and an adjustable tensioning

means (3, 4) for exerting a tensional pressure directed towards the
bearing axis (1) for touring skiing

and
a sole holder (B) for taking up the forces acting on the ski boot sole
(So) in upward and forward directions for downhill skiing,

characterised in

that the support bearing (A) and the sole holder (B) are two components
which are completely independent from each other and separately

mountable on the ski (Sk).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in

that the support bearing (A) and/or the sole holder (B) are variable as
to their longitudinal position on the ski (Sk).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in

that the support bearing (A) comprises a positionally variable support
member (2; 7) for placing the sole (So) of the ski boot (St) thereupon

for mutual engagement in a solid and/or frictionally fitting
manner and a tensioning member (3; 9) cooperating therewith

and
that the sole holder (B) includes a holding member (6; 11) for engaging
the ski boot tip which is held on the ski surface pivotable about an

axis extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the ski.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in

that the support bearing (A) comprises a stepping plate (2) which is
pivoting about an axis (1) and has a tensioning bridle (3) articulated

thereto.
Device according to claim 4, characterised in

that the stepping plate (2) on its upper side which for touring skiing
may be pivoted in a position to extend at least approximately in

parallel to the ski surface comprises at least one projection (5)
designed to engage into a complementary recess (Au) in the underside

of the ski boot sole and/or a surface area made for increased
friction.
Device according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in

that the support bearing (A) comprises a supporting sleeve (7) mounted to
be pivoted about an axis (8) and a tensioning bridle (9) pivoting

about the same axis (8).
Device according to one of the claims 3 to 6, characterised in

that the holding member of the sole holder (B) is a tensioning bridle (6;
11) mounted to fold about an axis.
