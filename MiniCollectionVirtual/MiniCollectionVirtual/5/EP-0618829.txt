<ABSTRACT>
A system (234) for monitoring the interface region between cellular constituents and plasma in a blood separation chamber (80) employs a sensor mechanism (236) for emitting upon the interface region energy that is absorbed by the cellular constituents. The sensor mechanism (244) also detects the intensity of the energy that is not absorbed by the interface region to generate an unabsorbed intensity output signal. The system (234) moves the interface region relative to the sensor mechanism during a prescribed time period. A first circuit (268) measures variations in the unabsorbed intensity output signal over the prescribed time period and generates a time based output. A second circuit (270) can derive the physical size of the interface region based upon the time based output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to centrifugal
processing systems and apparatus.Today, blood collection organizations
routinely separate whole blood by centrifugation into
its various therapeutic components, such as red blood
cells, platelets, and plasma. Conventional blood processing systems and methods use durable
centrifuge equipment in association with single use, sterile processing chambers,
typically made of plastic. The centrifuge equipment introduces whole blood into
these chambers while rotating them to create a centrifugal field.Whole blood separates within the rotating chamber under the influence
of the centrifugal field into higher density red blood cells and platelet-rich
plasma. An intermediate layer of white blood cells and lymphocytes forms an
interface between the red blood cells and platelet-rich plasma.In conventional blood separation systems and methods, it is important to
monitor the position of the interface during processing, to keep the formed
elements in the interface and red blood cells adjacent to the interface from
entering the platelet-rich plasma stream.US-4724317 describes a centrifuge which provides an indication of the
radial positioning of a plasma-red blood cell interface by an output indicating
the amount of radiant energy reflected through the blood.US-5104526 describes a centrifuge having a separation chamber which
separates the blood into an outer annular region of red blood cells and an inner
annular region of plasma. A transparent member provides a surface at a
predetermined angle to the direction of flow through which the red blood cell-plasma
interface may be viewed.The invention provides an improved interface monitoring systems for
blood processing apparatus according to claim 1. The interface detection
systems measure the size of the interface region based upon time based signals.One aspect of the invention provides a system for monitoring the
interface region between cellular constituents and plasma in a blood separation
chamber. The system includes a sensor mechanism for emitting upon the
interface region energy that is absorbed by the cellular constituents. The sensor
mechanism also detects the intensity of the energy that is not absorbed by the
interface region to generate an unabsorbed intensity output signal. The system
moves the interface region relative to the sensor mechanism during a prescribed
time period. A first circuit measures variations in the unabsorbed 
intensity output signal over the prescribed time
period and generates a time based output.In a
