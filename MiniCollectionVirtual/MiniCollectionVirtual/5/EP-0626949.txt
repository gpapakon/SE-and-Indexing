 TITLE Antipsychotic Nitrogen-Containing Bicyclic Compounds FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel nitrogen- containing bicyclic compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and methods of using these compounds to treat physiological or drug induced psychosis and as antidyskinetic agents.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Patent No. 3,127,413 (Gray) discloses octahydroisoindoles of the formula:wherein:Ar represents a radical from an aromatic ring system which is monocyclic or bicyclic; Alk represents on alkylene chain, straight or branched, containing at least one and not more than three carbon atoms; R is H or acyl; and R' is lower-alkyl. The octahydroisoindoles are useful as tranquilizing agents and for potentiating the action of barbiturates.Processes for preparing trisubstituted perhydro isoindolines of the following formula are described by Achini et al, Helvetica Chimica Acta, Jϋ, Fasc. 3, pp. 572-585 (1974) : 
wherexn :R1 is H or COC6H5 ;R2 is NR4R5 , Br , OH , phenyl , or CN ;R3 is H or OH; andR4, R5 are H or lower alkyl. German Patent 3721723 (Hoechst AG) describes substituted 6-Oxo-Decahydroisoquinolines of the formula:wherein: R1 is benzyl, C1-C4 alkoxycarbonyl or 2,2,2- Trichloro-ethoxycarbonyl; and R2 is Ci-Cβ alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, cyclohexyl-C C4 alkyl, 9-fluorenyl, 1-Cyano-l- phenylmethyl or phenyl-Cι-C4 alkyl. These compounds are useful as tranquilizing agents. U. S. Patent No. 3,689,492 (Schroeder et al.) discloses a compound having the formula:
This compound is useful as an analgesic in warm¬ blooded animals.U. K. Patent No. 1,141,664 (Jansen) discloses piperidine compounds having the formula:wherein Y is Ar or r^ and Z is Ar-'- or Ar^, Ar being phenyl, halophenyl or lower alkoxy phenyl, Ar1 being dihalophenyl, rihalophenyl, lower alkyl - halo- phenyl or trifluoromethy - halo - phenyl, Ar^ being halophenyl and Ar^ being di - halo - phenyl or lower alkyl - halo - phenyl, with the proviso that when Y is Ar then Z is Ar1, and when Y is Ar^ then Z is Ar^ .These compounds are useful as psychotropic and neuroleptic agents.European Patent Application No. 0 196 132 (Kennis and Vandenberk) discloses compounds having the formula:wherein X is 0 or S and Q is a radical of formula 

 or a radical of formula 
These compounds are useful as antipsychotics .Janssen et al . , Journal of Med. and Pharm. Chem., vol. 1, 281-297 (1959), disclose compounds having the formula :wherein L = H or F and R = H, F, Cl, or CH3) .The authors discuss the CNS depressant properties of
