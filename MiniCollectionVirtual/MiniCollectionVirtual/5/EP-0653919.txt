<ABSTRACT>
In the method proposed, the gas or gas mixture under analysis is passed through at least one support (5) in which at least one acoustic or ultrasonic transmitter or receiver cell (S1, S2) is located, preferably at an angle to the axis of the tube, to form a measurement path. The acoustic or ultrasonic transmitter or receiver elements (S1, S2) emit a pulsed acoustic signal, and the travel times of the pulses over the measurement path are determined. The variation in gas temperature along the at least one acoustic-transmission path is determined by, for instance, a temperature probe. The molecular weight is determined from the travel time of the acoustic pulses and the measured or assumed temperature. The device proposed is suitable for use in diagnosing deficiencies in the functioning of the lungs.

Method for measuring the molar mass of gases or
gas mixtures,

the gas or gas mixture to be examined being conducted
through at least one mount (5) on which one or more

sound and/or ultrasound transmitting and/or receiving
cells (S1, S2) are arranged as measurement sections,

preferably obliquely with respect to the mount access,

the sound and/or ultrasound transmitting-receiving
elements (S1, S2) radiating a pulsed sound signal,

the propagation times of the sound pulses across the
measurement section being detected, and

the molar mass being determined from the propagation
time of the sound pulses,
characterized

 the determination of the molar mass is based on
the propagation times of the sound pulses across the

parts of the measurement section which lie in the flow
channel, which are obtained from the propagation times

detected across the entire measurement section by
subtraction of the propagation times along the parts of

the measurement section which do not lie in the flow

the temperature of the part of the measurement section

which lies in the flow channel.
