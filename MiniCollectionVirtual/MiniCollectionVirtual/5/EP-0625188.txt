<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND COMPOSITION FOR ENHANCING FOAM PROPERTIES OF FERMENTED MALT BEVERAGESField of the InventionThe present invention relates to a method and composition which enhances the foam properties of malt beverages. More particularly, the present invention relates to enhancing the amount and persistence of the foam head on a fermented malt beverage.As used herein, the term "malt beverages" includes such foam- forming, fermented malt beverages as beer, ale, dry beer, near beer, light beer, low alcohol beer, low calorie beer, porter, bock beer, stout, malt liquor, non-alcoholic malt beverages and the like. Unless otherwise noted, the term "beer" shall be used throughout this specification as a generic term and refers to the entire group of fermented malt beverages.Background of the InventionThe process of making fermented malt beverages is commonly referred to as brewing. Generally, the principal raw materials used in making these beverages are water, hops and malt. In addition, adjuncts such as common corn grits, refined corn grits, and brewer's (milled) rice may be used as sources of starch. The starch will eventually be converted into dextrins and fermentable sugars.For a number of reasons, the malt, which is produced princiÂ¬ pally from selected varieties of barley typically has the greatest effect on the overall character and quality of the beer. First, the malt is the primary flavoring agent in beer. Second, the malt provides the major portion of theSUBSTITUTE SH 

fermentable sugars. Third, the malt provides the proteins which will contribute to the body and foam character of the beer. Fourth, the malt will provide the necessary enzymatic activity during mashing.Hops also contribute significantly to beer quality, including flavoring. In particular, hops (or hop constituents) add desirable bittering substances to the beer. In addition, the hops act as protein precipitants, establish preservative agents, and aid in foam formation and stabilization.MASHING. The brewing process begins by mixing ground malt and warm water in large tubs until it forms a malt mash of porridge- like consistency. The temperature of the mash is then raised in steps, with time allowed at each step for the various enzymes to convert the starches into fermentable sugars.If rice and corn adjuncts are to be used, they are separately cooked and a cooker mash is obtained. Production of the cooker mash involves the use of adjuncts along with a 10% to 30% portion of the malt(or the addition of commercial enzymes) in order to convert
