<ABSTRACT>
Novel industrial product, characterised in that it consists of an elongate hollow component, one of the dimensions of which, measured in a first direction, is greater than at least ten times another dimension, measured in a second direction, the ratio of the hollow cross-section to the total cross-section is of the order of 40 % and the ratio of the hollow cross-section to the solid cross-section is of the order of 60 %, the said hollow piece being obtained by application of the technique of moulding by Central Injection of pressurised Gas (CIG) to semicrystalline and amorphous plastics chosen from polyamides (PA), ABS (acrylonitrite/butadiene/styrene), SAN (styrene/acrylonitrile), ASA (acrylonitrile/styrene/acrylate), PPE (polyphenylene ether oxide), PC/ABS (polycarbonate/acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene), PP (polypropylene) and, preferably, terephthalate polyesters, possibly filled with glass fibre.

Industrial product comprising of an airfoil or spoiler 
made of a synthetic material for automobiles, with the afore 

mentioned spoiler presenting a primary dimension, which is 
measured in a primary direction, that is greater than or 

equal to ten times that of a secondary dimension, which is 
measured in a secondary direction, the ratio between its 

hollow section and its total section being in the order of 
40% and the ratio between its hollow section and its section 

in mass being in the order of 60%, the afore mentioned 
hollow portion being obtained by application of the 

technique known as the Central Injection of Gas under 
pressure technique (I.C.G) to semi crystalline and amorphous 

plastic materials selected from polyamides (PA), ABS 
materials, (acrylonitrile/butadine/styrene), SAN materials 

(styrene/acrylonitrile), ASA materials (acrylonitrile/styrene/acrylate), 
PPE materials (polyphenylene ether oxide) 

PC/ABS materials (polycarbonate/acrylonitrile/butadine/styrene), 
PP materials (polypropylene) and, as a preference, 

the polyester-telephtalates, which are eventually loaded 
with glass fibres. 
Spoiler according to claim 1, characterised in that it 
possesses a rigidity that is sufficient for it to be 

necessary only to fix the afore mentioned spoiler to the 
bodywork of the afore mentioned automobile at two points 

which are indifferently situated in its central zone, or at 
both of its two curved ends. 
Spoiler according to either of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the afore mentioned fixing is obtained 

by means of self tapping screws which are directly screwed 
into the afore mentioned resin. 
Process for the production of an airfoil or spoiler for 
automobiles according to any of the claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that it consists of, 

in the first place, injecting into a mould a resin 
of a polyester terephtalate type which is melted at a 

temperature in the order of between 270-290Â°C and at an 
injection pressure in the order of between 1000-1200 bar,  

 
for a period of time in the order of 1.5 seconds, with the 

injector nozzle being heated to a slightly higher 
temperature; 
in the second place, inducting into the injecting 
mass in fusion an inert gas such as nitrogen under a 

pressure in the order of between 300-350 bar for a period of 
time in the order of 10 seconds; 
in the third place, leaving the material to cool 
down progressively in the mould for a period of time in the 

order of 2 minutes, the pressure of the inert gas being 
progressively lowered to around 280 bar by either its 

expansion compensating for the withdrawal of the material or 
by being maintained at a constant following the induction of 

the gas; 
in the fourth place, allowing the gas to escape, 
over a period of time in the order of 10 seconds; 
and finally, in the fifth place, over a period of 
time in the order of between 5 and 35 seconds according to 

the extraction technique employed, proceeding to the opening 
of the mould and commencement of the unmoulding process of 

the hollow piece. 
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that, at 
the moulding stage, the provision of orifices destined to 

receive the self tapping screws for fixing onto the vehicle 
is envisaged, either at the curved extremities of the piece, 

or at two intermediate points forming feet.
