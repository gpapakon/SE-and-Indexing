with the slide faces (220, 250) of the part (2) on the

Bowden cable side when the cable (5) is relaxed and the
locking element (3) is located close to the end stop (210)

or in a centre position between the stops (210, 240), and
that at least one of the slide faces (220, 250 and 320,

350) is adjoined by a support face (230, 260 and or 330,
370 respectively), which can be brought into engagement

with each other when the locking element (3) is located
close to the stop (240).
Device according to claim 6, 
characterised in that

the innermost detent element (13a) on the housing side
forms a stop (121a) which projects radially further

inwards than all the remaining detent elements (13a) and

completely into the housing (1) lies between the stops 
(210, 240) close to the stop (210), and that when
