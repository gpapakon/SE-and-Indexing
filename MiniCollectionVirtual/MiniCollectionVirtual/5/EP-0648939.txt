<ABSTRACT>
At a vaned diffuser or a volute casing of a 
centrifugal fluid machine, pressure pulsation and 

vibrating forces acting upon the diffuser or the volute 
casing are mitigated or cancelled so as to abate the 

noise from the centrifugal fluid machine. The fluid 
machine having an impeller 3 rotating about a rotating 

shaft 2 within a casing 1 and having a vaned diffuser 4 
or volute 12 fixed to the casing 1 is constructed such 

that radius of the vane trailing edge of the impeller 3 
and radius of the vane leading edge of the diffuser 4 or 

radius of the volute tongue is varied in the direction 
of axis of rotation and inclinations, on a meridional 

plane, of the vane trailing edge of the impeller 3 and 
the vane leading edge of the diffuser 4 or the volute 

tongue are set in the same orientation, thereby reduction 
in head and efficiency or occurrence of an axial 

thrust may be restrained to the extent possible to 
optimally abate the noise and pressure pulsation of the 

centrifugal fluid machine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to centrifugal fluid assemblies
such as a pump or compressor and, more particularly, relates
to a centrifugal fluid assembly in which noise and pressure
pulsation may be suitably abated.A flow distribution which is not uniform in the peripheral
direction occurs at the outlet of an impeller due to the
thickness of a vane and a secondary flow or boundary layer
occurring between the vanes. Such nonuniform pulsating flow
interferes with the leading edge of the vanes of a diffuser or
a volute tongue, resulting in a periodical pressure pulsation
and causing noise. In some cases, such pressure pulsation
vibrates the diffuser and furthermore vibrates a casing or an
outer casing outside thereof through a fitting portion, whereby
the vibration is propagated into the air surrounding the
pump to cause noise.Some proposals for reduction of pressure pulsation and noise
in centrifugal assemblies are known from prior art.WO-A-93/10358 discloses a centrifugal compressor in which
trailing edges of blades of a working wheel are provided with
depressions diminishing the rotation radii of these edges into
the body of the blades. That means that according to WO-A-93/10358
a radial distance between an axis of rotation and
said trailing edge of the working wheel blade, measured along
a perpendicular on said axis of rotation, is made smaller at
the center of said working wheel blade trailing edge than at
the two ends of said working wheel blade trailing edge. Stationary
elements of an outlet system enter these depressions
and have a form following the profile of the depressions. US-A-2 362 514 discloses a centrifugal compressor comprising a
casing, an impeller located in the casing and having a plurality
of circumferentially spaced blades. Furthermore a diffuser
is located in the casing and surrounds the impeller for
converting a part of the velocity energy of a medium discharged
from the impeller into pressure energy. The diffuser
has a plurality of circumferentially spaced vanes, whereby the
diffuser vanes and the impeller blades have adjacent edges
bevelled in opposite directions toward the axis of rotation.
The diffuser vanes and the impeller blades comprise adjacent
portions inclined in opposite directions with reference to
planes through their roots and perpendicular to the plane of
rotation.FR-A-352 787 discloses a diffuser type mixed flow pump, i.e.
FR-A-352 787 is directed to a combination impeller/diffuser.
With the arrangement as disclosed in FR-A-352 787 the flow has
velocity components
