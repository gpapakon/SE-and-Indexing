<ABSTRACT>
The number of signal lines of a cable between a controller and a carriage is small, and the printing timing of each head is adjustable in units each smaller than one pixel. The signal lines include a signal line for serial printing data including printing data arranged in a predetermined order for printing heads, a signal line for a clock corresponding to each bit of the data, a signal line for a signal HDSL [1..0] representing that the printing data included in the serial printing data corresponds to which printing head, and signal lines for the signals for driving the heads. Before transferring data, one slice section corresponding to the time slot for transferring the unit printing data for each head is divided into sections, and further the sections are divided into subsections the number of which is equal to the number of print heads. The transfer of printing data is started from arbitrary subsection independently for each head.
