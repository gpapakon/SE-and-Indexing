<ABSTRACT>
In a scaffold for construction work, four supports 
(1a,1b) are provided at the respective corners of a 

rectangle. The front and rear supports on each side are 
connected to each other by a connecting frame (11) which 

can be folded without changing its height. After the 
connecting frames are folded, a scaffolding floor member 

(6b) provided on the top surface enclosed by the four 
supports can be lowered by rotating it about one of its 

ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a folding scaffold 
for construction work which allows operators to climb to 
high places, e.g. when they wish to work on a ceiling or 
a high part of a wall at a construction site, and which 
can be moved easily. Conventionally, when construction work has to be 
performed on a ceiling or a high part of a wall, a 
scaffolding frame is built parallel with the wall using 
pipes and clamps, and scaffolding plates are mounted on 
the frame so that operators can stand thereon. A 
folding scaffold is also known, which can be easily 
carried and assembled. In such a folding scaffold, as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Unexamined 
Publication No. Hei. 2-85467 and Japanese Utility Model 
Application Unexamined Publication No. Sho. 62-110439, 
wheels are attached to the lower ends of supports to 
make the scaffold mobile. Furthermore, the scaffold is 
divided along its centre line into two halves which are 
connected by hinges. To fold the scaffold, the centre-side 
ends of the scaffolding plates of the two halves 
are lifted and the halves are vertically erected at the 
centre of the scaffold. The scaffold is stored in this 
state. Since such a folding scaffold is folded by erecting 
the halves vertically, it has a large height when in the 
storage condition. As a result it is inconvenient to 
transport; for example, it cannot be loaded into a 
freight elevator. Furthermore, since the scaffold has a 
large height when folded, it is difficult for a single 
operator to fold the scaffold vertically and unfold it 
horizontally. GB-A-1311569 discloses a folding scaffold 
comprising supports arranged at at least the four  
 
corners of a rectangle and having respective wheels at 
their lower ends, horizontal bars connecting the two 
front supports and the two rear supports respectively, a 
first connecting frame extending between the front and 
rear supports and located substantially in the upper 
half space of the scaffold and a second connecting frame 
extending between the front and rear supports and 
located substantially in the lower half space of the 
scaffold, each connecting frame having front and rear 
parts rotatably connected to the respective supports 
about vertical axes and being divided centrally into two 
adjacent halves that are hingedly connected to each 
other about vertical axes, and a scaffolding floor 
member provided at the top of the scaffold, 
substantially within the area bounded by the four said 
supports and of a size large enough to substantially

<CLAIMS>
A folding scaffold comprising supports (1a,1b) 
arranged at at least the four corners of a rectangle and 

having respective wheels (5) at their lower ends, 
horizontal bars (5b) connecting the two front supports 

(la) and the two rear supports (1b) respectively, a 
first connecting frame (11) extending between the front 

and rear supports and located substantially in the upper 
half space of the scaffold and a second connecting frame 

(11) extending between the front and rear supports and 
located substantially in the lower half space of the 

scaffold, each connecting frame having front and rear 
parts rotatably connected to the respective supports 

about vertical axes (12) and being divided centrally 
into two adjacent halves that are hingedly connected to 

each other about vertical axes (14), and a scaffolding 
floor member (6b) provided at the top of the scaffold, 

substantially within the area bounded by the four said 
supports and of a size large enough to substantially 

cover the scaffold top, characterised in that the said 
first connecting frame extends between the front and 

rear supports on one side of the scaffold and the said 
second connecting frame extends between the front and 

rear supports on the other side, whereby, to fold the 
scaffold, the said connecting frames on both sides are 

foldable inwardly about their vertical axes. 
A scaffold according to claim 1, wherein the said 
floor member (6b) has its front or rear end rotatably 

connected to the top regions of the adjacent supports 
about a horizontal axis, and engagement members are 

provided at the other end of the floor member for 
detachable engagement with the tops of the other 

supports, whereby, to fold the scaffold, the said floor 
member is hingeable downwardly about its horizontal 

axis.  
 
A scaffold according to claim 1, wherein the said 
floor member comprises a scaffolding plate (25) laid on 

the said horizontal bars (5b) connecting the front 
supports (1a) and the rear supports (1b). 
A scaffold according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein each said support (1a,1b) comprises two telescopic 

pipes capable of expansion and contraction lengthwise. 
A scaffold according to any preceding claim, 
further comprising handrails (16) detachably mountable 

on a top surface of the said floor member (6b). 
A scaffold comprising two scaffolds according to 
any of claims 1 to 5 connected together end to end, the 

said front supports (21) of the respective scaffolds 
being interconnected to form a central supporting member 

(23).
