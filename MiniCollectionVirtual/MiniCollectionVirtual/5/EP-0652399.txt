<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
system for vehicles. In particular, the present invention relates to 
an optical system of the type capable of emitting two or 
more light beams in directions separate from each other. Normally, in known optical systems of the type 
described above, each of the said light beams is generated 
by a corresponding emitter system comprising its own 
light source and its own reflecting body, which houses at 
least partially the corresponding light source, and is 
shaped so that it orientates a flow of light emitted from 
the light source in the corresponding said direction. Known optical systems of the type described 
above, although acceptable from the functional point of 
view, have the disadvantage first of all of having 
relatively high power consumption, due primarily to the 
large number of light sources. Known optical systems also 
have relatively high production costs due not only to the 
large number of light sources but also to the large 
number of reflecting bodies, the making of which is in 
itself relatively costly. The object of the present invention is to provide 
an optical system for vehicles which enables the disadvantages 
described above to be overcome in a simple and 
economical way, and which is also highly efficient and 
reliable in operation. According to the present invention, the optical 
system for vehicles which is made comprises emitter means 
and has at least one first and at least one second outlet 
for a first and second light beam respectively, said emitter means 
comprising a single light source and being capable of emitting a 
principal light beam having a first axis, while optical selection 
means being provided to send at least part of the said principal 
light beam towards at least one of the said outlets and along a 
corresponding path to form a corresponding outgoing light beam, 
characterized in that is also comprises distributor means associated  
 
with each of the said outlets and having at least one surface shaped 
in the form of a diffractive refracting optical system. The invention will now be described with reference 
to the attached drawings, which show some embodiment 
examples, in which: 
Figure 1 shows, schematically and in section, a 
first preferred embodiment of the optical system according 
to the present invention; Figures 2 and 3 are similar to Figure 1 and show 
the optical system in two different operating conditions; Figure 4 shows, schematically and in section, a 
second preferred embodiment of the
