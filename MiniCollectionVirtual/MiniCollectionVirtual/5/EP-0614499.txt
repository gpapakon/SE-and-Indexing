<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in and relating to processes for the preparation of bonded polyester fiberfill batts, sometimes referred
to as battings, especially processes whereby such improved batts with desirable aesthetic and serviceable qualities
may be obtained,Polyester fiberfill (sometimes referred to as polyester fiberfilling material) is well accepted as a reasonably inexpensive
filling and/or insulating material for pillows, cushions and other furnishing materials, including bedding materials,
and in apparel, and is manufactured and used in large quantities commercially. For many of these uses, as
disclosed, e.g., in U. S. Patents: Tolliver U.S. 3,772,137; Stanistreet U. S. 4,068,036; Scott U. S. 4,129,675; Pamm U.
S. 4,281,042; Frankosky U. S. 4,304,817; Siniscalchi U. S. 4,551,383; and LeVan U.S. 4,869,771, it has been desirable
to make bonded batts, e.g., by spraying a resin-bonding agent, usually of an acrylic polymer, or by blending the polyester
fiberfill with binder fibers, such as are well known in the art, or by use of both a resin-bonding agent and binder fibers.To improve the aesthetics of polyester fiberfill, it has often proved desirable to "slicken" the fiberfill with a coating
of durable (i.e., wash-resistant) coating that has usually been a silicone, i.e., a cured polysiloxane as disclosed, e.g.,
by Hofmann U. S. Pat. No. 3,271,189; Mead et al U. S. Pat. No. 3,454,422; Ryan U. S. Pat. No. 3,488,217; Salamon
et al U. S. Pat. 4,146,674; LeVan, above; Takemoto Oil and Fat Co., Ltd., Japanese Published Application No.
58-214,585(1983); or other types such as the polyalkylene oxide variety disclosed by, e.g., Marcus U.S. Patent No.
4,818,599.Despite all the prior suggestions and commercially-available materials, especially for use in premium level apparel
products, sleeping bags, and comforters, there still remains a need for an easily prepared, homogeneous batting that
is characterized by softness and drapability to conform to the wearer's body, good insulating performance, low levels
of fiber leakage through shell fabrics, enhanced durability to laundering by washing/drying or by dry cleaning, and
enhanced structural integrity whereby the batting is able to hang freely without the need for having it quilted into small
size panels.According to the invention, there is provided a process for preparing a bonded batt, comprising
forming a blend of polyester fiberfill, in amount by weight about 70 to about 96%, intimately mixed with a binder fiber,
preferably a

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a bonded batt, comprising forming a blend of polyester fiberfill, in amount by weight about
70 to about 96%, intimately mixed with a binder fiber having binder material of melting point lower than the softening

point of the polyester fiberfill, in amount by weight about 4 to about 30%, preparing a continuous batt from said
blend, said batt having an upper face and a lower face, advancing said batt through a spray zone, whereby both

faces of the batt are sprayed with resin, in total amount about 10 to about 30% of the weight of the sprayed batt,
including the about resin, said resin being selected to provide, after curing, a cured resin having a glass transition

temperature (Tg) of about 0 degrees Celsius or less, heating the sprayed batt in an oven to cure the resin and
soften the binder material, followed by hot-rolling the heated batt to achieve intimate contact between the resin

and the fibers in the faces of the batt, and cooling the rolled batt.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the hot-rolling of the heated batt is effected by passing the batt between
heated rolls in a calender.
A process according to Claim 1, wherein the hot-rolling of the heated batt is effected by passing the batt around
heated S-wrap rolls.
