<ABSTRACT>
A process for the catalytic partial oxidation of a hydrocarbon 
feedstock comprises contacting a feed comprising a hydrocarbon 

feedstock and an oxygen-containing gas at elevated pressure and a 
temperature of at least 950째C with a catalyst comprising as a 

catalytically active metal rhodium, iridium or ruthenium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the catalytic
partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, in particular a process for the
preparation of a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen from
methane, natural gas, associated gas or other sources of light
hydrocarbons.The partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, for example methane or
natural gas, in the presence of a catalyst is an attractive route for
the preparation of mixtures of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which
mixtures are known in the art as synthesis gas. The synthesis gas
so-produced may be converted into valuable products, for example
hydrocarbon fuels boiling in the middle distillate range, prepared
by means of the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, hydrocarbon waxes,
lubricating base oils or methanol.The optimum catalytic partial oxidation process would give high
yields of carbon monoxide and hydrogen at elevated pressures, for
example about 30 bar, and very high space velocities, for example of
the order of 1,000,000 Nl/l/h. For thermodynamic reasons, in order
to obtain high yields of carbon monoxide and hydrogen under these
process conditions, it is necessary to operate the partial oxidation
process at high temperatures. However, at the high temperatures
required in such operation, there exists a major problem in
maintaining a high level of catalyst activity and selectivity over
the prolonged operation times demanded by a commercial process.The literature contains a number of documents disclosing
details of experiments conducted into the catalytic partial
oxidation of hydrocarbons, in particular methane, employing a wide
range of catalysts. The majority of these experiments, however,
have been conducted under very mild conditions or under conditions
wholly unsuited to the operation of a commercial catalytic partial
oxidation process. Thus, European Patent Application publication No. 0 303 438
(EP-A-0 303 438) discloses a process for the catalytic partial
oxidation of a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock in which a gaseous
mixture of the hydrocarbonaceous feedstock, oxygen or an oxygen-containing
gas and, optionally, steam, is introduced into a
catalytic partial oxidation zone to contact a catalyst retained
therein. The catalyst employed in the process may comprise a wide
range of catalytically active components, for example palladium,
platinum, rhodium, iridium, osmium, ruthenium, nickel, chromium,
cobalt, cerium, lanthanum and mixtures thereof. Further, it is
stated in EP-A-0 303 438 that materials not normally considered to
be catalytically active may also
