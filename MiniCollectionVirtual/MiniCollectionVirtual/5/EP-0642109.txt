<DESCRIPTION>
As is expressed in the title of this specification,
the present invention refers to a didactic-educational
toy for elementary arithmetic operations, reading and
writing, which provides a series of relevant and advantageous
features with regard to the presently existing
devices for these activities. The child's imagination
is also exercised due to the fact that the pieces can be
connected as a construction, obtaining three-dimensional
geometric shapes as there are varied connection and
joining pieces.The different elements that identify the digits
have some corresponding protuberances that make the
represented number identifiable by touch.Upon handling the different elements that comprise
the toy, mental calculation and the interest to learn
how to read and write are enhanced to a larger degree
than with other means and devices presently on the market.Upon carrying out operations and forming the tens,
the same are more easily identifiable. There are also
figurative pieces that allow one to study the spatial
concepts of left, right, up, etc., stimulating the child's
oral expression as problematic situations arise, making
the didactic toy more attractive.All the components parts are easily interconnected,
which allows the base surface to be increased in order
to carry out operations, as well as to form words and
sentences.There are presently means or tools to carry out this
type of operations, consisting of prismatic slide rules
of different lengths and colors, abacuses and other 
types of boxes containing cubes, slide rules and boards.With these elements, upon being very repetitive,
carrying out elementary operations becomes tremendously
difficult, and on the other hand the basic digits are
not identifiable by touch. Figurative pieces that can
be assembled to study the spatial concepts of left,
right, etc. and to stimulate oral expression, as well
as graphic expression, mathematical as well as to start
the learning of reading and writing, are not known either.In general lines, in order to achieve the above
cited advantageous characteristics, as well as to eliminate
the inconveniences cited in the prior art, the
didactic-educational toy for elementary arithmetic
operations, reading and writing, that constitutes the
object of the invention, is comprised of a series of
parts or elements that we can distribute in two big
groups: one of them that comprises all the parts that
allow elementary aritmetic operations to be done, and
the other that includes another part and letter cards
to form words and

(6), "X"-shaped or double "X"-shaped with small opposite

inside recesses (22) that fit in the respective elongate
diametrically opposite notches (21), of the stepped
