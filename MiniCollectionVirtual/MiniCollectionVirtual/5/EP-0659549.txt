<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to laminar
structures having a polyimide core layer, inner
fluorinated ethylene-propylene (FEP) copolymer layers,
intermediate polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)/fluorinated
ethylene-propylene (FEP) copolymer blend layers and
outer fluorinated ethylenepropylene (FEP) copolymer
layers, which can be used in the form of narrow tapes
as an insulating wire wrap.Laminar structures of polyimides and fluorinated
polymers, such as laminates of Kapton® polyimide film
and fluorinated ethylenepropylene copolymers (FEP), are
commercially available and are characterized by a
unique combination of physical properties not
separately possessed by each individual component. An
important use of such laminar structures is as an
insulation wrap for electrical conductors. However, a
drawback of such laminar structures resides in the lack
of sufficient bond strength and durability when exposed
to high temperature environments. In addition, when
such laminar structures are heat-sealed onto metal
conductors, they cannot be readily removed or stripped
from the conductor. In many end-uses, it is important
that the insulation be readily strippable from the end
of the metal conductor without damaging the conductor
by nicking or scoring. The spirally wound insulation
wrap, usually applied to the conductor in film or tape
form and heat-sealed thereon, experiences some degree
of shrinkage during the heat-sealing step and is quite
difficult to remove. Both conventional polyimide/FEP
and FEP/polyimide/FEP insulation tapes have poor 
strippability from the conductor since, in the case of
polyimide against the metal, the coefficient of
friction is high; and in the case of FEP against the
metal, the FEP tends to bond to the metal surface
during the heat-sealing step.Moreover, while laminar structures containing
polyimide have a very desirable balance of properties,
such as high temperature and electrical properties,
under some conditions, polyimide-containing structures
can arc track, resulting in the undesirable formation
of a carbonaceous char. Arc tracking is a catastrophic
failure in the presence of an electrical arc when a
short circuit occurs between the conductor and a
conducting medium external to the insulation, such as a
moderately conductive fluid. Such a failure causes
mechanical damage to the insulation which rapidly
propagates at the elevated temperature of the
electrical arc.U.S.-A-3,616,177, issued on October 26, 1971,
discloses an asymmetric, four-layer laminar structure,
for use as an insulation
