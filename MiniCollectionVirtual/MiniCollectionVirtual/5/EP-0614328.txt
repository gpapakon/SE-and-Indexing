<ABSTRACT>
A multi-layered circuit component is efficiently manufactured with a three-dimensional complicated and various circuit 
group which are incorporated in it exactly and compactly. A primary molded product (wiring board) is formed of a thermo-plastic 

resin or thermo-setting resin. On one or both sides of the primary molded product, desired conductive circuits are formed, and 
one or more places of this primary molded product on which the circuits are formed are fixed to a secondary molding die. A thermo-plastic 

secondary molding material is injection-molded into a composite molded product incorporating all or part of the circuits 
of the primary molded product. The composite molded product has the circuits in multilayers. Furth
er, at or after the first 
and second moldings, the through holes are made in given positions of the circuits on the layers. Metal is coated on the inner surface 

of each through hole in order to form the conductive part in each given position of the circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite
molded article such as a multi-layered circuit
substrate having a three-dimensional conduction
circuit, and to a composite molded article which can
be prepared efficiently and will be suitably utilized
for electric and electronic components such as a
chassis incorporating a circuit board, an IC memory
card, and so forth.A method of producing a composite molded article having multi-layered conduction circuits is disclosed in JP-A 3-78291.Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing an example
of a primary molded article as a three-dimensional
circuit substrate according to the present invention.Fig. 2 is a perspective view showing the state
where a circuit pattern is formed on the surface of
the primary molded article (Fig. 1), wherein (a) shows
one side (the face) and (b) shows the other side (the
back).Fig. 3 is a perspective view showing the state
where a multi-layered circuit substrate was formed by
using two primary molded articles (Fig. 2) having the
circuit pattern formed thereon and making them 
composite by secondary molding.Fig. 4 shows a composite molded substrate
(finished product) having a three-dimensional
conduction circuit formed by boring through-holes in
the multi-layered circuit substrate (Fig. 3) and
establishing electric conduction of each layer by
plating the inside of the through-holes, wherein (a)
is a perspective view thereof and (b) is a sectional
view taken along a line X - X of (a).Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing a primary
molded substrate to be incorporated and sealed as
another embodiment of the present invention.Fig. 6 is a perspective view showing the state
where a circuit pattern is formed on the surface of
the primary molded substrate (Fig. 5), wherein (a)
shows the face and (b) shows the back of (a).Fig. 7 shows a secondary molded substrate
incorporating and sealing the primary molded substrate
(Fig. 6) having the circuit pattern, wherein (a) is a
perspective view of the appearance and (b) is a
sectional view taken along a line X'- X' of (a).Fig. 8 shows the state where a circuit pattern is
further formed on the surface of the secondary molded
three-dimensional circuit substrate (Fig. 7) and
plating is effected inside the through-holes, wherein 
(a) is a perspective view of the appearance and (b) is
a sectional view taken along a line X" - X" of (a).
