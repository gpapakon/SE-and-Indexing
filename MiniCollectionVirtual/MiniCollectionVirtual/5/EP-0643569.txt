<CLAIMS>
Device for automatically verifying the positioning of an odontological
instrument in a radicular canal with respect to the apex of a tooth, comprising a

conducting element (4) adapted to move in the radicular canal towards the
mucous membrane of a patient, comprising means (13) for measuring the

conductance, capable of presenting a threshold of variation, during said
displacement, when the conducting element (4) is in contact with the mucous

membrane, comprising means (30) for detecting at least one predetermined
critical value of the conductance (pc) and means for producing a signal (33) when

said determined value (p) attains said critical value (pc), characterized in that it
comprises:


means for determining the drift, or slope, (p) of the conductance during
the displacement of the conducting element (4) in the radicular canal, and

recording means for memorizing the value (P
M
) of the maximum drift, or slope, of
the conductance, during the displacement of the conducting element, and analysis

means for deducing the critical value (p
c
) of the value of the maximum drift, or
slope, (P
M
).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the critical value (p
c
) is
substantially equal to half the value of the maximum drift, or slope (P
M
).
Device according to either one of the preceding Claims, characterized in
that the conducting element is constituted by a tool (4) animated by a movement

of vibration under the action of an ultrasound generator (7), and the device
comprises servo-control means (33) for controlling the operational parameters of

the tool (4), namely its amplitude and/or its frequency of vibration, the servocontrol
means (33) being adapted, when the value of the drift, or slope, of the

conductance attains the critical value (p
c
), to modify the operational parameters of 
the tool (4) in accordance with a predetermined law, this operational law possibly

leading to the complete stoppage of the vibration of the tool (4).
