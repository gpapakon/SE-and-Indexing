<ABSTRACT>
A mono operated Venitian blind comprises a driving shaft (5) mounted in a headrail, one or more frictionally driven shutter wheels being mounted on said shaft, said shutter wheels carrying the upper ends of ladder cords for a number of horizontal laths and a bottom rail (4) being liftable up and down by the driving shaft (5). The lowermost ends of the ladder cords are attached to said bottom rail. At the driving shaft (5) a wheel for a ball cord is mounted on the driving shaft (5) at each end of the blind. An endless ball cord (2) is passed around each of said wheels, said endless ball cord being also passed around an idle wheel placed below the bottom rail (4) in its lowermost position. One part of each ball cord (2) is passed through a vertical bore in a bearing part (3), by means of which two bearing parts (3) in each and end of the blind are carrying the bottom rail (4) in such a way, that said bottom rail is tiltable around a longitudinal axis. The vertical bores are of such dimensions, that the ball cord (2), but not the individual balls, can pass through the bore; and a number of balls are left out from that part of the cords (2), which are passed through said bores. Thereby a clearance is obtained enabling the laths to be tilted without lifting up or down the bottom rail.

<DESCRIPTION>
Mono Operated Venetian Blind.The invention relates to a mono operated Venetian blind of the kind mentioned in the preamble of the claim.Usually the lifting up and down of a mono operated Venetian blind is made using one or more lift cords being attached to the bottom rail and guided through openings in the laths to a lift cord pulley on the driving shaft. The advantage of the mono operation as compared to the usual dual operation is that a more flexible and neater operation is obtained, because of the possibi¬ lity of using, for the rotation of the driving shaft, either a motor, a rotating rod or a cord/ball cord.DE 2.238.177 discloses a Venetian blind, in the headrail of which a driving shaft carrying toothed wheels is placed. Each toothed wheel is connected to an endless cord or chain, through a toothed belt and a further toothed wheel outside the plane of the blind, said endless cord or chain being passed around an idle wheel, which is positioned beneath the bottom rail. The bottom rail is connected to the endless cords through driving pins. This permits the lifting up and down of the Venetian blind to be forcibly guided by means of the endless cords and without using lift cords in the laths.Anyhow, every rotation of the driving shaft leads to a movement of the bottom rail. That is the reason why the driving shaft can not also be used for the turning of the laths.According to the invention, a mono operated Venetian blind of the kind as stated above is constructed as disclosed in the characterizing part of the claim.In this construction the driving shaft is also utiiizable for the turning of the laths, because of the clearance caused by the left out bails. Concommitantly, the advantages known from the above mentioned DE patent are obtained, i.e. inter alia the applicability for windows in pitched roofs, the pitch of which is only very small; the forcibly guiding of the lifting up and down; the avoi¬ dance of gliding of a lifted down blind in case the window is turned in preparation for cleaning of the outside glass thereof. Besides openings for lift cords in the laths, and thereby light pas¬ sing slits, are avoided.The invention is explained in greater detail in connection with the accompanying drawing, in which fig. 1 is a vertical sectional view of the upper part of a Venetian blind according to the inven¬ tion, the bottom rail being lifted up, fig. 2 is a vertical sectional view of the Venetian blind, the bottom rail in it's lowermost posi¬ tion and the laths turned into one direction, and

Mono operated Venetian blind comprising a driving shaft (5) mounted in a headrail, one or more frictionally driven shutter wheels being mounted on said shaft, said shutter wheels carry- ing the upper ends of ladder cords for a number of horizontal laths; a bottom rail (4) being lift- able up and down by the driving shaft (5), the lowermost ends of the ladder cords being at¬ tached to said bottom rail, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in a wheel for a ball cord being mounted on the driving shaft (5) at each end of the blind, an endless ball cord (2) being passed around each of said wheels, said endless ball cord being also passed around an idle wheel placed below the bottom rail (4) in it's lowermost position; one part of each ball cord (2) being passed through a vertical bore in a bearing part (3), whereby two bearing parts (3) - in each an end of the blind - are carrying the bottom rail (4) in such a way, that said bottom rail is tillable around a longitudi¬ nal axis, said vertical bores being of such dimensions, that the ball cord (2), but not the indivi¬ dual balls, can pass through the bore; and a number of balls being left out from that part of the cords (2), which are passed through said bores.
