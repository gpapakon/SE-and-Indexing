<ABSTRACT>
An initially integral terminal assembly (84) 
useful for terminating a selected conductor (74) of a 

flat power cable (72) having at least two insulated 
conductors (74) includes upper and lower plate 

sections (26) extending in diverging directions from 
a common bendable hinge (46) defining a cable receiving 

region therebetween. Each plate section (26) has at 
least a first portion (28) corresponding to the first 

conductor (74) and a second portion (36) associated 
with a second conductor of the cable (72). Each 

portion (28, 36) further includes conductor 
terminating regions (30,54) intermediate opposed 

upstanding side walls of the upper and lower 
plate sections (26,50). One of the terminating regions 

(30,54) of a selected one of the first or second 
portions (28 ,36) of the plate sections (26,50) 

corresponding to a selected cable conductor (74) 
contains respective arrays of shearing means (56) 

adapted to penetrate the selected conductor 
(74) inserted therebetween upon the upper and lower 

plate sections (26,50) being pressed together to shear 
the insulation and the selected conductor (74) The 

terminating regions (36, 54) of the portions 
(28,38) corresponding to the remaining cable 

conductors (74) are severed from the assembly (84) 
prior to terminating the assembly to the cable (72). 

Upon termination the assembly (84) is electrically 
connected to the selected conductor (74) and 

electrically isolated from the remaining conductors (74).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
electrical connectors and more particularly to terminals
for use with flat power cables.U.S. Patent Nos. 4,867,700 and 4,859,204 disclose
terminals which are crimped onto a flat power cable by
penetrating the insulation covering the cable's flat
conductor and also shearing through the conductor at a
plurality of locations. The cable is of the type
entering commercial use for transmitting electrical
power of for example 75 amperes nominal, and includes a
flat conductor one inch wide (1 inch = 25.4 mm) and about 0.020 inches
thick with an extruded insulated coating of about 0.004
to 0.008 inches thick over each surface with the cable
having a total thickness averaging about 0.034 inches.
One embodiment of terminal is stamped and formed of
sheet metal and includes a pair of opposing plate
sections disposed along respective major surfaces of the
cable and including opposing termination regions
extending transversely across the cable. Each
terminating region includes a transverse array of
alternating shearing wave shapes and relief recesses of
equal width, the relief recesses defined by arcuate
projections extending away from the cable-proximate
side, and the wave shapes extending outwardly from the
cable-proximate side and toward relief recesses in the
opposed plate section. Each shearing wave shape has a
transverse crest between parallel side edges, and the
side edges of the corresponding relief recesses are
associated with the wave side edges to comprise pairs of
shearing edges, preferably with zero clearance. When
the plate sections are pressed against a cable section
disposed therebetween the crests of the wave shapes
initiate cable shearing by their axially oriented side
edges cutting through the cable insulation and into and 
through the metal conductor. The wave shapes extrude
the sheared cable strips outwardly into the opposing
relief recesses as the shears propagate axially along
the cable for limited distances, forming a series of
interlocking wave joints with the cable while exposing
newly sheared edges of the cable conductor for
electrical connection therewith.In U.S Patent No. 5,219,303 a pair of upper and
lower terminal portions coextending from a hinge and
defining a cable receiving region therebetween, are used
for terminating to flat cable upon the upper and lower
plate sections being pressed toward each other and into
flat cable. When used with single-conductor cable the
assembly provides two terminations across the width of
the cable. When
