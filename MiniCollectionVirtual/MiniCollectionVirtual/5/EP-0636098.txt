<ABSTRACT>
Container or box for packaging and unwinding a coil (18) of wire (2), which comprises: a box-like body (5, 11) that has a polygonal plan, can be opened at the top and is meant to accommodate a coil for wire; and a coil covering panel (16) that has a central circular opening (17) and a contour that matches the plan shape of the box-like body, so that it can freely descend within the box-like body in contact with the coil as the height of the coil decreases as the wire is unwound from above through the central opening of the panel, in order to prevent the lifting of turns of wire between the peripheral region of the panel and the container and thus the accidental entanglement of turns.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container or box for 
packaging and unwinding a coil of wire. In unwinding wires, such as soldering wires, from reels 
or coils there is the problem of unwinding uniformly and 
uninterruptedly and possibly without forming bumps and 
without applying undesirable twists to the wire, which would 
lead to defects or in any case to a reduction in the quality 
of the soldered joints. A cylindrical container, on which a 
hood with a wire guiding sheath is placed, has already been 
proposed for this purpose; in this container, a movable lid 
or disk is placed above the coil so that it can descend 
freely as the vertical thickness of the coil decreases; the 
disk or lid has a smaller diameter than the internal 
diameter of the container, so as to delimit, together with 
the inner wall of said container, a gap through which the 
wire, unwound from the coil passes. With a container structured in this manner, turns of 
the wire often escape beyond the movable disk, and since the 
wire is highly flexible, produce overlaps and form tangles 
that force to stop the soldering operation that is in 
progress and entail considerable downtimes to eliminate them 
and resume soldering.  
 A welding wire packaging container, as set forth in the 
preamble of claim 1, is known from the prior document US-A-4 
869 367. Other containers for packaging and handling cable type 
material are disclosed in the prior documents EP-A-480 259 
and US-A-1 640 368.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a 
container or box based on a new concept which is suitable 
for eliminating the drawbacks described above. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
container or box that allows stacking of a plurality of 
boxes one on top of the other, so as to allow considerable  
 
savings in transport and storage space as well as easy 
handling. Another object of the present invention is to provide a 
container or box that can be obtained from inexpensive 
materials and can be disposable. These objects and others which will become apparent 
hereinafter are achieved by a container for packaging and 
unwinding a coil of wire, according to the invention, 
with the features set forth in claim 1. Advantageously, the container is constituted by: a 
first panel made of punched cardboard, which can be folded 
so as to obtain a first box-like body with multiple closure 
flaps at its top, two of which have a through slit or slot; 
by a second panel made of punched cardboard which can be 
folded into a

<CLAIMS>
Container for packaging and unwinding a coil (2) of 
wire (18), comprising a box-like body (1) for accommodating 

the wire coil (2) with an openable top for allowing 
insertion of the wire coil (2), and a coil covering panel 

(16) having a central circular opening (17) and a contour 
matching the inner plan
 shape of said body (1), said panel 
(16) being freely descendable in said box-like body (1) in 

contact with said coil (2) as height thereof decreases 
following unwinding of wire (18) from an upper end of the 

coil (2) through the central opening (17) of the panel 
(16), 
characterized in that
 said box-like body (1) has a 
polygonal plan cross-section, said panel (16) 

matching with the contour of the inner plan shape of said polygonal body 
(1), the angular portions of said panel preventing lifting of 

wire turns between the peripheral region of the panel (16) 
and the inner surface of said box-like body (1) and thus 

accidental entanglement of the wire turns. 
Container according to claim 1, characterized in 
that said container (1) with said coil covering panel (16) 

having a polygonal plan shape are of the disposable type. 
Container according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that it comprises a pair of handles (3,4) for its manual 

handling and transport. 
Container according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises: a first panel 

made of punched cardboard, that can be folded so as to 
obtain a first box-like body (5) with multiple closure flaps  

 
(6-9) at its top, two of said flaps having a through slit 

(10) or slot; a second panel made of punched cardboard, that 
can be folded so as to obtain a second box-like body (11) 

that can be inserted in the first one and has two lateral 
flaps that are shaped like handles (3,4) and can be inserted 

in a respective slit or slot of the first box-like body; and 
a coil covering panel (16) which is also made of cardboard. 
Container according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that said box-like body (1) 

comprises side walls arranged so as to accommodate a coil 
(2) having elliptical turns that are offset at angles such 

as 45, 60, 72, 90 or 120Â°, the turns being arranged in 
groups, each group having its major axis orientated at right 

angles to a respective wall of the container body (1). 
Container according to claim 4, characterized in 
that it comprises a wire unwinding hood (19) that is like a 

frustum-shaped pyramid with a polygonal base (21) and can be 
inserted on the container. 
Container according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that it comprises angular elements 

(32) for confining the coil. 
Container according to claim 7, characterized in 
that each one of said angular elements delimits a 

longitudinal recess (33) and comprises a removable insert 
(34) for abutment against the coil. 
Container according to claim 8, characterized in 
that said angular elements are made of cardboard and that 

said insert is a wood strip. 
Container according to any one of the preceding 
claims characterized in that for containers adapted to  

 
contain coils (2) with a weight up to approximately 230 kg, 

said body (1) is made of lightweight material such as 
cardboard, and for coils weighing over 200 kg in materials 

such as wood-fiber composite or plywood.
