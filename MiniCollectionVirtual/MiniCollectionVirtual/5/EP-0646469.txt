<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing machine having a print head (109) which can be pressed under spring loading against a back pressure roller (108), the active strand (107) of a printing ribbon (104) and a recording medium to be printed running through between said print head and the back pressure roller (108). The printing ribbon (104) is uncoiled from a first reel (101) and is wound up onto a second reel (103), and a slip clutch (115) is connected between a drive (117) and the second reel (103) and/or between a drive (117) and a drive roller bearing against the recording medium, which slip clutch is arranged in a wheel (2) with a concentric shaft (1). Connected between the shaft (1) and the wheel (2) is at least one pair of friction discs (5, 6) which are spring-loaded axially. As an advantageous clutch, it is proposed that the wheel (2) be designed as a hollow body which can be opened, that all the elements (5, 6, 7) of the slip clutch (115) be located inside the wheel (2), and that the shaft (1) be capable of being inserted in the slip clutch (115), the at least one shaft-side friction disc (5) being connectable to the shaft (1) in a positive-locking manner.
