<ABSTRACT>
An electric motor (30) stator (31) and rotor (51 to 55) 

are made by holding magnetic elements (32, 53) thereof in 
position in dies (25; 66 to 69) and injecting a plastics 

material into the dies to provide bearing carrier mountings 
(27, 51) substantially concentric with the pole faces (33) 

of the stator (31) and poles (53) of the rotor. The motor 
is completed by providing a bearing (21) in the stator 

bearing carrier mounting (27) and a shaft (13) in the rotor 
bearing carrier mounting (51), the shaft running also in a 

further bearing mounting tube (8). The motor and drive so 
made is mounted to drive an agitator (7) and spin tub (4) 

of a laundry machine (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to clothes washing machines.It is an object of the present invention to provide a clothes washing machine
having an electric motor which directly drives the machine agitator and spin tub
wherein a pair of bearings rotatably support the motor rotor and the rotating parts of the
washing machine.The invention consists in a clothes washing machine (1) including a cabinet (2),
a stationary water container (3) having a base and a side wall mounted in the cabinet;
a perforated spin tub (4) within said container and a vertical axis agitator (7) within said
spin tub wherein
said base incorporates a plurality of downwardly extending ribs (4a, 5);a bearing tube (6) is mounted in said base supported by said ribs (4a, 5)a pair of vertically spaced bearings (20, 21) are mounted in said bearing tube (6);a vertical shaft (10) is rotatably mounted in said bearings;a seal (23) extends between said shaft (10) and said tube (6) above said bearings
(20, 21);  said agitator (7) is mounted on said shaft (10) for rotation therewith; spin tub bearing means are mounted on said shaft for rotatably supporting said
spin tub on said shaft; an electric motor (30) having a stator (31) and a rotor (52) drives said vertical
shaft (10) said stator (31) including a central hub portion, said shaft (10) passing
through said hub portion, a plurality of stator poles (32) radially displaced from and
facing outwardly from said hub portion, and a web (41) connecting said central hub
portion and said stator poles (32), said hub portion including stator locating means (27)
directly locating said hub portion on said bearing (21) such that
the faces (33) of said stator poles (32) are concentrically located relative to said shaft
(10); said hub portion of said stator (31) is fixed to the lower end of said bearing tube
(6) and said rotor (52) is fixed to said shaft (10) in a manner so that said spaced
bearings (20, 21) act as bearings providing relative rotation of said stator and rotor of
said electric motor; andinterconnecting means are provided between said spin tub and said agitator which
on appropriate operation interconnect said spin tub (4) and said agitator (7) for rotation
together in one direction by said shaft (10) to produce a spin action and disconnect said
spin tub (4) from said agitator (7) so that only said agitator (7) is rotatably oscillated
by rotating oscillation of said rotor (52) to produce a washing action.To those skilled in the art to which the invention
relates, many changes in construction and widely
