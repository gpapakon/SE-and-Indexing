<ABSTRACT>
When using a thread measuring tool with a "go" plug gauge (1) and a "no go" plug gauge (4) and scale (13) indicating the thread depth, the gauge is worn or damaged so that the tool must be discarded. By providing the tool with interchangeable gauges (1, 4), as referred to in the application, it is possible to replace the worn or damaged gauge in that the gauge is placed on a shank (2, 5) which can be inserted into a tapered bore (3, 6) in a rod (7). The rod extends inside the housing (16) of the tool. When for instance a plug gauge (1) is worn down, it is extracted from the rod (7) and a new one is inserted. In order to be able to adjust the tool, the rod (7) is provided with an external thread (17) so that it can be screwed in and out of the housing (16) and thus be adjusted so that the end of the plug gauge holder (12) will just flush with the end of the plug gauge (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thread measuring tool with a "go" 
plug gauge and a "no go" plug gauge designed at each end of an 
elongated housing, which housing comprises a thread bushing 
screwed in the one end of the housing, in which thread bushing 
a through-going spindle is mounted in the interior of the 
housing, the opposite ends of said spindle being connected to 
said plug gauges, and where a plug gauge holder with a measuring 
value indicator is arranged around the "go" plug gauge, 
which plug gauge holder is inserted telescopically into the 
housing against the resistance of a spring. Thread measuring tools of this type, known from the publication 
WO-A-83/03664, can be used for checking the tolerances of 
the thread holes while at the same time the thread depth can 
be read direct from a measuring value indicator. By this hitherto known tool the "go" plug gauge and the "no 
go" plug gauge are designed at each end as an integrated part 
of a through-going spindle extending through the housing. In use the "go" plug gauge and the "no go" plug gauge are 
worn, and they may both be damaged as well. When one or both 
plug gauges do no longer meet the requirements in respect of 
tolerance, shape etc., the whole tool must be discarded or at 
best be provided with a new spindle with plug gauges. The replacement of the spindle with plug gauges can normally 
only take place while at the same time adjusting the measuring 
value indicator of the tool, because the plug gauge must be 
flush with the end of the plug gauge holder in order to provide 
an accurate reading of the thread depth. It is the object of the invention to overcome these short-comings 
of the known measuring tool, and this is achieved by a 
thread measuring tool of the kind described above, which tool  
 
according to the invention is characterized in that the one 
end of the spindle is provided with a thread on the outside 
designed to co-operate with an interior thread in the thread 
bushing in such a manner that the placing of the plug gauge in 
the housing is adjustable, that said plug gauges are provided 
with a shank which can be inserted into a bore at each end of 
the spindle, and that the shanks and the bores are cylindrical 
and slightly tapered, respectively, or vice versa. Considerable advantages in use and by way of reduced costs are 
hereby obtained. First of all the replacement of a worn down 
or damaged gauge is simple and comparatively inexpensive. It 
will thus suffice to replace only one gauge thereby saving 
money for

<CLAIMS>
1. A thread measuring tool with a "go" plug gauge (1) and a "no 
go" plug gauge (4) designed at respective ends of an elongated 

housing (16), which housing comprises a thread bushing (10) screwed 
into one end of the housing (16), in which thread bushing a 

through-going spindle (7) is mounted in the interior of the 
housing (10, 16), the opposite ends of said spindle being connected 

to said plug gauges (1, 4), and where a plug gauge 
holder (12) with a measuring value indicator (13) is arranged 

around the "go" plug gauge (1), which plug gauge holder (12) 
is inserted telescopically into the housing (10, 16) against 

the resistance of a spring (11), 
characterized
 in 
that one end of the spindle (7) is p
rovided with a 
thread (17) on the outside designed to co-operate with an 

interior thread in the thread bushing (10) in such a manner 
that the placing of the plug gauge (1) in the housing (10, 16) 

is adjustable, that said plug gauges (1, 4) are provided respectively 
with a shank (2, 5) which can be inserted into respective bores (3, 6) at 

respective ends of the spindle (7), and that the shanks (2, 5) and 
the bores (3, 6) are cylindrical and slightly tapered, respectively, 

or vice versa. 
2. A thread measuring tool according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that the thread bushing (10) is provided 
with a transverse screw (9) which, during co-operation with a 

recess (8) in the spindle (7), is designed to lock together 
the spindle (7) with the thread bushing.
