Electric high voltage circuit-breaker having a 
self-generated quenching-gas flow and having a 

compression device for the blow-out of electric arcs, 

in which circuit-breaker a pressure chamber (5), which 
can be heated up by the electric-arc energy and is 

directly adjacent to the isolating gap section, is 
connected, if appropriate in a valve-controlled manner, 

to a compression space (8) which is associated with the 
compression device, and in which circuit-breaker the 

compression space is connected to a low-pressure space 
(10), on the one hand by way of an excess-pressure 

valve which has a movable valve head and on the other 
hand by way of a top-up valve which has a movable valve 

head, characterised in that the two valve heads of the 
valves arranged between the compression space (8) and 

the low-pressure space (10) are formed as two 
concentric ring-type discs (12, 13), which rest 

directly against each other, have different diameters 
and partially overlap, and said valve heads are 

combined to form a single valve device. 
Electric high voltage circuit-breaker 
according to claim 1, characterised in that the first 

of the ring-type discs (12), which has a comparatively 
small diameter, is pressed, on the side which faces the 

low-pressure space (10), with spring-loading against a 
fixed limit stop as a valve seat (15), and lifts off 

from the valve seat (15) when a pre-determined excess 
pressure occurs in the compression space (8). 
Electric high voltage circuit-breaker 
according to claim 2, characterised in that the other 

ring-type disc (13), which has a larger diameter, as a 
flap-valve, is applied in a sealing manner with its 

inner opening edge (16) against the first ring-type 
disc (12), and rests with its outer edge (17) on a 

fixed limit stop (18) as a valve seat, and in the case  
 

of a movement of the compression device in the closing 
direction frees the cross-section between the 

compression space (8) and the low-pressure space (10) 
for the purpose of topping up the compression space. 
Electric high voltage circuit-breaker 
according to claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the 

spring-loading of the first ring-type disc (12) is 
adjustable. 
Electric high voltage circuit-breaker 
according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised in 

that the two ring-type discs (12, 13) surround a switch 
rod (20), which passes through the compression space 

(8) and the low-pressure space (10) and moves the 
compression device.
