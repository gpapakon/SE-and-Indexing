<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to upholstery, the base structure of the furniture concerned and its production. The invention seeks a pioneering design to offer various arrangement possibilities and an assembly mode enabling easy recycling. To achieve that objective, the upholstered piece of furniture is made from a base structure which has been dressed so as to give a shape to said piece of furniture. The comfort is provided independently of the dressing by the covering of the base structure.
