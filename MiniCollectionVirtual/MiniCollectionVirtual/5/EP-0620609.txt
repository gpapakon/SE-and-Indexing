<ABSTRACT>
An electrochemical multicell battery having polymer electrolyte membranes. The necessity for a compact and lightweight construction in order to achieve high power densities resulted in the present design of a multicell battery according to the invention. Particular features are the bipolar plate (1), which is developed as a frame version (2), the mechanical pressing elements, which are arranged in the centre of a plane, and the optimised shape of the end plates.

An electrochemical multi-cell battery with polymer electrolyte diaphragms with 
a serially disposed first end plate (12), a first insulating plate (17), a first current take-off 

plate (16), a plurality of framelike bipolar plates, a second current take-off plate 
(16), a second insulating plate (15) and a second end plate (13), which are clamped 

against one another by means of tie bolts (11) integrated into the frames (2) of the 
bipolar plates and the plates (12, 13, 15-17), the bipolar plates are formed by two 

electrically conductive plates (1) and a frame of synthetic plastics material, which is 
glued resiliently by means of a seal
ing composition or adhesive (7) between the 
current-conducting plates which are placed against one another, whereby a cooling 

space (5) is formed between the plates (1) of a frame (2) and, on the other side of 
the plates (1) a respective gas space (3) is formed, gas and coolant supply passages 

and gas (4) and coolant (6) antechambers being integrated into the frames (2), and 
whereby structures for distributing the reaction gases to the supply passages are 

integrated into the first insulating plate (17), while, for maintaining the 
homogeneous pressing-together of the plates (12,13,15-17), pressure elements 

(14) disposed centrally on the surface are integrated into the second insulating plate 
(15).
