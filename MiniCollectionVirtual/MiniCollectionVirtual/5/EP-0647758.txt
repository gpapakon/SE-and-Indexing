<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for opening and closing a movable wing about an axis, comprising an assembly movable in translational motion in an essentially vertical plane, which carries a rolling element (10) and a motor (20) for driving the rolling element in rotation. According to the invention, the distance between the axis of rotation (d) of the rolling element and the surface of contact of the element with the ground varies.

A device for opening and closing a door or gate leaf
that is movable about an axis, the device comprising an assembly that

is movable in translation in an essentially vertical plane, which
device carries a running element (10) in contact with the ground and

a motor (20) for rotating the running element (10), and is
characterized in that the distance between the axis of rotation (
d
)
of the running element (10) and the surface of the element (10) in

contact with the ground varies.
An opening and closing device according to claim 1, characterized
in that the running element is a running wheel (10) mounted to rotate

eccentrically.
An opening and closing deice according to claim 2, characterized
in that the eccentricity of the running wheel (10) is about 10 mm for

a diameter of 100 mm.
An opening and closing device according to any one to claims 1 to
3, characterized in that the moving assembly includes at least one

rod (31) held captive to move in translation between at least one set

of guide wheels (41, 42, 43, 44, 41', 42', 43', 44') mounted on the
leaf to rotate freely.
An opening and closing device according to claim 4, characterized
in that each set of guide wheels comprises two pairs of guide wheels

(41, 42, 43, 44), the guide wheels (41, 42, 43, 44) in each pair
being mounted on opposite sides of the rod (31), and the two pairs of

guide wheels being spaced apart from each other along the
longitudinal axis of the rod (31) so as to guide the rod (31) in its

translation movement.
An opening and closing device according to claim 4 or 5,
characterized in that the rod (31) moves in translation parallel to

the leaf, and in that the running element (10) is mounted to rotate
on an axis (
d
) that is offset relative to the direction in which the
rod (31) moves in translation. 
An opening and closing device according to claim 4 or 5,
characterized in that the rod (31) moves in a direction that is

oblique relative to the leaf.
An opening and closing device according to claim 7, characterized
in that the running element (10) is mounted to rotate on an axis (
d
)
that intersects the direction in which the rod (31) moves in

translation.
An opening and closing device according to any one of claims 4 to
8, comprising a structure (50) secured to the leaf, characterized in

that it includes two sets of guide wheels (41, 42, 43, 44, 41', 42',
43', 44') mounted at the same level on two facing portions (52, 53)

of the structure (50) and extending essentially perpendicularly to
the leaf, and in that the moving assembly includes a frame (30)

having two parallel rods (31, 32) held captive to move in translation
between the two sets of guide wheels, the motor (20) being secured to

the frame (30).
An opening and closing device according to any one of claims 4 to
9, characterized in that each guide wheel (41, 42, 43, 44, 41', 42',

43', 44') is essentially circularly cylindrical in shape, being
provided on its cylindrical peripheral surface with a V-section

annular groove (43a, 44a, 43'a, 44'a).
