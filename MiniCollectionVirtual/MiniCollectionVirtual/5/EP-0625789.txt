<ABSTRACT>
A writing pad having a construction wherein two substrates each having electrodes formed on one of the surfaces 
thereof are disposed in parallel in such a way that their electrodes face one another with a predetermined gap between 

them. The gap is defined by insulating dot spacers fixed at regular intervals to at least one of the electrode surfaces. The 
height G of the dot spacers is smaller than 15 µm, the mean center distance L between the adjacent dot spacers is smaller 

than 100 µm, d 
>
 G and 3d 
<
 L 
<
 100d (where d is a diameter of the dot spacers on the electrode surface to which the 
dot spacers are fixed). According to this writing pad, when characters or graphics are inputted to the input substrate of 

the writing pad by an input pen, an erroneous input does not occur even when fingers, etc, erroneously come into contact 
with the input substrate, and the erroneous operation does not occur, either, when the input operation is repeated many 

times by the input pen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a writing pad
suitable for inputting handwritten images. More
particularly, the present invention is concerned with a
writing pad which, when characters or graphics are inputted
to an input substrate of the writing pad by an input pen,
does not cause an erroneous operation even when fingers or
other portions of a writer's hand erroneously come into
contact with the input substrate, and which is durable
against a vast plurality of repeated sliding inputs.
Moreover, the present invention relates to a process for
producing the same.Known in the art is a discriminating contact sensor
which comprises a writing pad comprising a juxtaposed pair
of upper and lower sheets each having an electrode attached
thereto, separated at a given spacing by a plurality of
insulating dot spacers, the upper sheet being flexible, and
a position detecting circuit that, when the upper flexible
sheet is depressed with an input pen, electrically detects
the coordinates (x, y) of the depressed position of the
upper flexible sheet (see U.S. Patent No. 3,911,215). In this sensor, when the input-side sheet having an
electrode attached thereto (upper electrode-bearing sheet)
of the writing pad is depressed with an input pen, the
input-side sheet is flexed by the writing pressure load to
thereby cause the upper and lower electrodes of the writing
pad to contact with each other so as to create an
electrical connection at the depressed site. This permits
detection, by means of the position detecting circuit, of
the coordinates (x, y) of the position of the sheet
depressed by the tip of the input pen.A handwritten image input device can be obtained by
connecting the above position detecting circuit of the
sensor to a storage unit having an appropriate memory
capacity. In such a handwritten image input device, the
coordinates of the positions of a plurality of dots
composing the inputted image are stored in predetermined
addresses of the storage unit.Further, when this storage unit is connected to a
display unit, the plurality of position coordinates
detected by the position detecting circuit and stored in
the storage unit are inputted into the display unit, so
that the handwritten images inputted in the writing pad are
reproduced on a display screen of the display unit.In the above conventional writing pad, the upper and
lower electrodes are contacted by depressing the upper
sheet with an input pen so as to flex the sheet, so that in
many cases the distance between the dot spacers is, for 
example, in the
