<ABSTRACT>
A moulded tray comprising a blank of single-face corrugated board having a liner element (L) and a corrugated element (C) moulded to define a base (1), an upstanding side wall (2) and an outwardly directed rim (3), the base (1) and side wall (2) and the side wall (2) and the rim (3) being connected by smoothly radiussed regions (4 and 5) whereby the currugated element (C) substantially retains its integrity in the radiussed regions to thereby provide a moulded tray having increased rigidity.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MOULDED CONTAINER Field of the InventionThis invention relates to moulded containers suitable for supporting for display and containing food and other products. The invention finds application in a wide range of containers, including moulded trays for food products such as meats, cakes and various forms of so-called fast-foods, and lidded containers suitable for food products such as hamburgers, pizzas and all other forms of fast-foods.Background of the InventionFood products such as meats, cakes etc. are usually displayed in supermarkets on shallow trays covered by a plastic film. The most widely used tray is the moulded polystyrene foam tray which is durable and may be manufactured at relatively low cost. Similarly, containers having integrally hinged or separate lids are also moulded from polystyrene foam and are widely used to package fast-foods such as hamburgers.Moulded polystyrene foam trays and containers are being increasingly criticized for their impact on pollution of the environment and their lack of recyclability. However, until the present invention, few if any practical alternatives of comparable cost have been developed by the packaging industry. For example, moulded trays and integrally hinged lidded containers, such as hamburger cartons, have been made from so- called box board, but such trays and containers are prohibitively expensive when made from sufficiently rigid box board materials. When made from lighter box board materials, the trays and containers have insufficient strength to provide an acceptable alternative to the polystyrene foam products.Single-face corrugated board is widely used in the packaging industry as a cushioning material. It is not traditionally used to form cartons or boxes, although proposals have been made in AU-B-30298/63 (277947) to use modified single-face corrugated board for this purpose, and in AU-B-44160/64 (284298) to use multi-ply wound single-face board to form tubular containers. Neither of these proposals has found commercial acceptance due to the greater strength and more widely accepted use of standard 

(double-face) corrugated board in the packaging industry. It has never been proposed to make moulded containers or trays from single-face corrugated board, the expectation being that it would not be possible to form moulded containers and trays from such material. It has been surprisingly found by the present applicant that by moulding single-face corrugated board in a particular configuration, containers and trays are able to be moulded in a

The claims defining the invention are as follows:
1. A moulded container or tray suitable for food products, comprising a blank of single-face corrugated board having a liner element and a corrugated element moulded to define a base, an upstanding side wall and a rim, characterized by smoothly radiussed regions between the base and said side wall, said corrugated element substantially retaining its integrity in said radiussed regions to provide a moulded container or tray of the required rigidity.
2. The container or tray of claim 1, wherein said rim has an outwardly directed portion connected to said side wall by further smoothly radiussed regions.
3. The container or tray of claim 1 or 2, wherein at least said corrugated element has a coating to increase its resistance to moisture and heat and to further increase its rigidity and to retain its moulded shape.
4. The container or tray of claim 3, wherein the coating is a selected acrylic resin coating or a modified acrylic resin coating.
5. The container of any preceding claim, further comprising a lid moulded in a similar form to said container and hinged to said container along part of its rim.
6. A method of forming a moulded container or tray comprising the steps of forming a shaped blank from single-face corrugated board having a liner element and a corrugated element, moulding the blank under heat and pressure to form a moulded container or tray having a base, an upstanding side wall and rim, said moulding being performed to provide smoothly radiussed region between the base and the side wall to maintain the integrity of the corrugated element in these regions to thereby form a moulded container or tray having the required rigidity.
7. The method of claim 6, furthering comprising moulding the blank to form an outwardly directed rim connected to said side wall by further smoothly radiussed regions.
8. The method of claim 6 or 7, further comprising the step of coating at least the corrugated element of said blank to increase its resistance to moisture and heat and to increase the rigidity 


of the moulded product and to retain its moulded shape.
9. The method of claim 8, wherein the coating is a selected acrylic resin coating or a modified acrylic resin coating.
