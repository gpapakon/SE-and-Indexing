<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a system for the casting of anchors meant for the 
mooring of floating oil producing and/or drilling platforms, for which an anchor laying 

craft is used, whose general arrangement consists of a deck with wells for anchors, a 
capstan for dealing with chains, cable drums of an improved kind, lockers for the 

stowing of chains built into the underside of the deck of the craft, which are led by a 
capstan from such lockers or back to them, along hawsepipes, and drums for winding 

cables, mounted on a bed. When a floating platform is being moored, an improved 
laying device is used which prevents any slipping or dropping after each platform chain 

has been fastened to the previously laid line whenever the latter has to be lowered to its 
place in the sag. The invention also provides an improved line fisher.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a line fisher for the casting of anchors intended to moor 
floating drilling and producing oil rigs. The conventional method of mooring floating offshore drilling and production 
platforms, particularly when intended for use in deep waters, uses a combination of 
chains and large gauge cables. Usually at least eight mooring lines are needed, and two 
main winches are needed for each mooring line. Some examples of systems most used 
are described in FR-A-2208373, US-A-3985093, US-A-3967572 and US-A-4722293. In the conventional system the chains, cables and anchors are stored on board 
the platform and they are dropped by transferring the anchor, already fastened to its 
chain, into a special kind of tug with the aid of a device known as an anchor chaser tied 
to a tug hawser. After such transfer the tug travels away from the platform to wherever 
it has been agreed upon beforehand that the anchor is to be dropped, thereby towing the 
chain that the windlass on the platform has released. After an agreed length of chain has been paid out, if the system is not of the 
continuous kind, the chain is tied to the steel cable (on the platform) and work goes 
ahead, this time with the aid of the capstan for the cable whereupon, at the spot where 
the anchor is to be taken hold, it is lowered and the chaser retrieved. To do this 
requires a very strong tug, able to make its way against the weight of the anchor and the 
sag of the cable and chain. Experience has shown that the ideal minimum requirements to keep a 
production rig in place consist of -- working from the sea bottom upwards - 
- an anchor, 
a fast length of chain, an intermediate length of cable, a second length of chain, a 
fairlead, a windlass, and a locker for the second length of chain. The foremost 
advantage of this system is that the platform is moored by the chain, instead of by the 
cable as in the conventional system, and therefore corrosion and metal fatigue troubles 
are reduced. However to put this system into effect meant having to overcome the problem 
of casting anchors, for which the conventional methods could not be employed; all 
solutions so far devised turned out to be extremely costly and complicated. It has been proposed to lay the lines in advance and to chase for the anchor  
 
later when the platform is to be moored. This invention aims to produce an improved line fisher for use in mooring a 
platform where a previously laid chain is to be recovered for connection to moor the 
production platform.

<CLAIMS>
A line fisher for use in an anchor-laying process and characterised by 
consisting of a sheave and crown (50) fixed by means of a spindle (51) which passes 

through a body a part (52) of which is reinforced in the shape of an inverted groove; 
the body being provided with a hoisting eye (53) at the front 

part there of; 
and by the fact that said body has a front part (54) which is more open in order to guide 

the chain, and a back part (55) having a guiding nozzle and stop which prevents a triple 
link of the chain from passing through said guiding nozzle.
