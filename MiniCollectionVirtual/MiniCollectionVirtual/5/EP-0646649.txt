<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a method of producing 
iturin A, in which cells of 
Bacillus
amyloliquefaciens
 
are incubated and iturin A is collected from the 

culture. It also relates to an antifungal agent for 
profound mycosis, containing iturin A as the active 

ingredient. Heretofore, there have been known few 
medicines effective against profound mycosis, but 

iturin A may be an effective antifungal agent for 
profound mycosis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
producing iturin A and to an antifungal agent for profound
mycosis comprising iturin A as the active ingredient.Heretofore, infectious diseases to be caused by
fungi such as mold, yeast and others have been essentially
in local infection in the skin, respiratory organs, vagina
and others, but recently, these tend to increase also in
systemic infection. In particular, systemic infectious
diseases such as profound infectious diseases to be caused
by depression of immunological competence resulting from
use of immunosuppressive agents, carcinostatics and others
are increasing. Many cases of fatal serious infectious
diseases have been reported in the clinical medicine
(Nippon Byori Gakkai Kaishi, 74, 61 (1985)). However, as
compared with noticeable progress of the chemotherapy for
infectious diseases to be caused by bacteria, it must be
said that the chemotherapy for infectious diseases to be
caused by fungi is belated at present. One reason is that 
bacteria are prokaryocytes, being different from animal
cells of eukaryocytes with respect to the cell background,
and preparation of medicines having selective toxicity to
them is easy; while fungi which are composed of
eukaryocytes like animal cells are hardly differentiated
from animal cells because of the similar cell background
of them so that elevation of the selective toxicity
specific only to fungi but not to animal cells is not
easy.At present, only amphotericin B is known as a
medicine effectively applicable to profound mycosis such
as candidiasis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis,
mucormycosis, coccidioidomycosis, paracoccidioidomycosis,
blastomycosis, histoplasmasis, sporotrichosis

teach a method for producing iturin A from Bacillussubtilis strains and
recommend to use iturin A against phytopathogenic fungi. They do not
disclose nor suggest (i) the production of iturin A (especially iturin A1-free
iturin A) from Bacillusamyloliquefaciens strains, and (ii) the use of
iturin A in preventing or curing profound mycosis in animals including
human beings.The object of the present invention is to provide a method of
producing known iturin A and to provide an antifungal agent for profound
mycosis which
