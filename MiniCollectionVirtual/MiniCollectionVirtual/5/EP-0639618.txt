<ABSTRACT>
Free-flowing compression-moulding compositions comprising 40-80 % by weight of inorganic filler, 20-60 % by weight of organic reactive resin and optionally further auxiliaries and additives where the reaction resin contains an epoxide, optionally in liquid form, a latent catalyst and a powdered polyisocyanate which is solid at room temperature.

<CLAIMS>
Pourable moulding compositions consisting of 40 to
80 wt.% of an inorganic filler, 20 to 60 wt.% of an

organic reactive resin and optionally additional
auxiliary substances and additives, characterised in

that the reactive resin consists of 5 to 50 parts by
weight of epoxy resin containing 2 to 4 epoxide groups

per molecule and having an epoxide equivalent weight
of 90 to 500, as well as of 0.01 to 10 parts by

weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the resin
present, of a thermolatent catalyst having an onium

structure and/or a Lewis-acid salt structure and of 50
to 95 parts by weight of a solid pulverised

polyisocyanate having a melting point of above 25Â°C.
Moulding compositions according to claim 1,
characterised in that quartz powder, chalk, Al
2
O
3
,
SiO
2
, metal powder and/or metal oxide powder are used
as inorganic fillers.
Process for the production of moulding compositions
according to claim 1, charac
terised in that in a first
step the inorganic filler is mixed with an optionally

liquid epoxide and with a latent catalyst and
subsequently solid pulverised polyisocyanate is added

to the mixture thus obtained.
Use of the moulding compositions according to claim 1,
optionally containing additional known per se

additives and auxiliary substances, for the production
of mouldings, coatings, adhesives, moulded plates,

electrical insulators and in mould making.
