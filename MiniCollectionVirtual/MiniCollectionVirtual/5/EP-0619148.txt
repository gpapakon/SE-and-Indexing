<ABSTRACT>
A liquid jetting apparatus includes a drive mechanism 
(1), fixed, rotating and jetting cylinder sections (2, 3, 4) 

connected in order, first rotation transmission mechanism (14) 
connected to the drive mechanism and having a first operating 

element (27), second rotation transmission mechanism (15) 
connected to the drive mechanism and having a second operating 

element (39), the rotational speed of the second rotation 
transmission mechanism being slightly different from that of 

the first rotation transmission mechanism, a first operating 
rod (22) connected at its one end to the first rotation 

transmission mechanism through a position change mechanism 
(29) and at its other end to the jetting cylinder section (4), 

a second operating rod (33) connected at its one end to the 
second rotation transmission mechanism and at its other end 

to the rotating cylinder section (3), and detector (41) for 
detecting the positions of the first operating element and the 

second operating element and reversing the direction of 
rotation of the drive mechanism when both operating elements 

(37, 39) are present at a prescribed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a liquid jetting 
apparatus, more particularly to a liquid jetting apparatus 
used, for example, to fluidize sludge accumulated in an oil 
tank by jetting it with a washing liquid or the like. Numerous liquid jetting apparatuses for use in 
cleaning the interiors of oil tanks have been proposed, 
including those described in Japanese Utility Model Appln. 
Publications Hei 4-33275, Sho 58-9674, Sho 59-36281 and Sho 
58-23435, Japanese Utility Model Appln. Public Disclosure Hei 
4-110158, Japanese Patent Appln. Public Disclosure Sho 56-15855 
and U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,233. All of these apparatuses 
are supplied with high-pressure washing liquid whose high 
pressure is used to rotate a turbine and, in turn, to rotate 
or swing the nozzle section that jets the washing liquid. In a method which rotates a turbine using the high 
pressure of supplied washing liquid, however, the jetting 
pressure of the washing liquid is naturally lowered by the 
resistance of the turbine. Under some circumstances, this 
reduction of the washing liquid jetting pressure prolongs the 
period required for breaking down solidified sludge in an oil 
tank or makes it impossible to achieve adequate breakdown. In addition, a particular problem is encountered 
when oil is used as the washing liquid. Since there is no way  
 
of preventing the oil from getting into the turbine and 
other mechanical parts, the oil is liable to be ignited 
by frictional heat or sparks produced by the operation 
of the mechanical sections. JP-A-02 035 981 describes a liquid jetting apparatus 
comprising drive means, a fixed cylinder section disposed 
under the drive means, a rotating cylinder section 
rotatably disposed at the lower end of the fixed cylinder 
section and having a free end with an inclined end 
surface, a jetting cylinder section having an inclined 
upper end face-to-face with the inclined end surface of 
the rotating cylinder section and a lower end equipped 
with a liquid jetting nozzle, first operating rod 
connected to the drive means for rotating the jetting 
cylinder section, and second operating rod connected to 
the drive means for rotating the rotating cylinder 
section, wherein the first operating rod is connected 
with the drive means through a first rotation 
transmission mechanism, the second operating rod is 
connected to the drive means through a second rotation 
transmission mechanism having rotational speed slightly 
different from that of the first rotation transmission 
mechanism, the first
