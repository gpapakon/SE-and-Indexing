<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coated cutting tool having a tenacious
and high wear resistance coating formed on the surface of a substrate such
as cemented carbides and a process for the production of the same.Improvement of the service life of a cutting tool has been carried out
by vapor deposition of a coating layer of titanium carbide (TiC) on a surface
of cemented carbides, cermets or ceramics and in general, a coated cutting
tool having a coating layer formed by a thermal or heat-assisted chemical vapor
deposition method (hereinafter referred to as heat-assisted CVD method) or
plasma CVD method has widely been spread.However, in the case of carrying out a working using these coated cutting
tools, for example, a working needing the wear resistance of a coating layer
at a high temperature, such as high speed cutting working, and a working needing
a number of workings and a number of thrusting-in workpieces, such as working
of small-sized parts, decrease of the service life of a tool tends to
occur due to lacking of the wear resistance of the coating layer or occurrence
of damage of the coating layer.In the coating film by the heat-assisted CVD method, the adhesiveness
thereof to a substrate is excellent, and depending upon the variety of the substrate,
η phase as a brittle layer tends to be deposited thick on the interface
with the substrate, in particular, near the cutting edge ridge line contri
buting to the property. During cutting, the coating layer falls away with
this η phase to cause progress of wearing and to cause dispersion in the
service life of the tool and it cannot sometimes be said that the coating layer
sufficiently contribute to improvement of the wear.In these coated cutting tools, factors affecting the wear resistance and
peeling resistance are the chlorine content in components for forming the coating 
layer, and preferred orientation.Coating of titanium carbide or titanium nitride (TiN) by the heat-assisted
CVD method is generally carried out by the use of titanium tetrachloride (TiCL4)
as a titanium source, methane (CH4) as a carbon sorce and nitrogen gas as a
nitrogen source. Thus, in the coating using these gases, chlorine resulting
from the titanium tetrachloride is taken in the coating layer, resulting in
deterioration of the film quality.As a report as to the chlorine in the film, there are disclosed techniques
in which coating is carried out at a low temperature side using a plasma CVD
method, for example, in "Hyomen Gijitsu (Surface Techniques)" Vol. 40, No. 10,
