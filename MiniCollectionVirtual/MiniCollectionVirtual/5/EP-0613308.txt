<ABSTRACT>
A projection-type color display device comprises light source means emitting three light beams, 
each beam being of one of the three primary colors, a first, a second and a third liquid crystal 

light valve (8B, 8G, 8R) of an active matrix type, each arranged to modulate a respective one 
of said liquid crystal light beams so as to form modulated light beams containing images in the 

three primary colors, and each including a light shielding layer on one side of a liquid crystal 
layer, dichroic means (9) for synthesizing said images, said dichroic means reflecting the 

modulated light beams from said second and third liquid crystal light valves and transmitting 
the modulated light beam from said first liquid crystal light valve, wherein the images included 

in the modulated light beams from the second and third liquid crystal light valves are laterally 
inverted with respect to that from the first liquid crystal light valve so as to compensate for the 

image inversion caused by reflection by said dichroic means, and driving means arranged to 
drive said liquid crystal light valves by scanning their matrix arrangements. Each of said liquid 

crystal light valves is arranged to have its light shielding layer facing the light incident side. In 
order to compensate for the lateral inversion of the images from the second and third liquid 

crystal light valves with respect to that of the first liquid crystal light valve, said driving means 
is arranged such that the scanning direction of said second and third liquid crystal light valves 

is reversed with respect to that of said first liquid crystal light valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a projection-type color display device which uses a plurality of 
light valves for forming and projecting picture images. A projection-type color display device according to the prior art portion of claim 1 is disclosed 
in the document International Symposium of the Society for Information Display, Digest of 
Technical Papers, 1986, pages 375-378, S. Morozumi et al, "LCD Full-Color Video Projector". 
In this prior art, light from a halogen lamp or a metal-halide lamp is separated into three light 
beams of the primary colors red, green and blue by means of a dichroic mirror. Each light beam 
is then image modulated by a respective liquid crystal light valve, and the modulated light 
beams are synthesized by a dichroic mirror group. The synthesized image is projected on a 
screen by a projection lens. Another projection-type color display device based on the same principle as the one explained 
above is disclosed in the document EP-A-0 266 184 (prior art within the terms of Art. 54(3) 
EPC). In the prior art, one of the three liquid crystal light valves should be reversed in order to make 
the device compact for synthesizing images so that the colored light beams enter from the side 
of the substrate on which thin-film transistors are integrated. This results in a deterioration of 
the characteristics of the thin-film transistors and that of the picture quality, such as the 
contrast ratio. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to eliminate the problems of the prior art 
described above and to provide a compact projection-type color display device, producing 
bright images with high picture quality and high picture reproducibility. This object is achieved with a projection-type color display device as claimed. In accordance with the present invention, the driver circuit is arranged so that only one of the 
three liquid crystal light valves displays laterally inverted or reflectively symmetric images like a 
mirror. This enables an image display with a large contrast ratio and a high picture quality 
without a deterioration of the capability, and a compact structure. Ways of carrying out the invention are described in detail below with reference to drawings 
which illustrate only specific embodiments, and in which: 
Fig. 1is a cross-section of a first embodiment of the present invention,  Fig. 2shows the transmittance against wavelength characteristics of dichroic mirrors, Fig. 3is a perspective view showing the positional relationship between the liquid
