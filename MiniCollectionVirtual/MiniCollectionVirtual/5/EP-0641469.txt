<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a card including at least one electronic component (14), particularly a card having no external contacts and further including a coil (16). According to the method, a structure (10) made of meltable material for positioning the electronic component (14) and the coil (16) is arranged on a work surface (2). By supplying energy, the structure (10) is at least partially melted and pressure is exerted on said melted structure to form a mass in which the electronic component (14) and the coil (16) are embedded.

Process for the manufacture of a card which has a
first group of steps comprising the following steps :


B) the provision, on a working surface (2), of at
least one electronic element (14);
C) the provision, on said working surface (2), of a
structure (10;46;56;60) that is porous or comprises a

relief, the hollows of which communicate, this structure
being composed of a fusible material and defining a

positioning zone (12;13), and placing of this structure so
that said electronic element is located inside said

positioning zone;

this first group of steps being followed by a second group
of steps having the following steps :


F) the provision of energy serving to at least
partially melt said structure (10;46;56;60);
G) the application of pressure to said structure in
the direction of said working surface (2) so that said

fusible material constituting said structure forms a mass
(32;42;38) into which said electronic element is embedded;

this second group of steps being followed by a step of
solidification of said mass.
Process for the manufacture of a card which has a
first group of steps having the following steps :


B) the provision, on a working surface (2), of at
least one electronic element (14);
C) the provision, on said working surface (2) of a
structure (56;60) that is compressible and composed of a

fusible material so that said electronic element is
superposed on this structure and is situated close to this

latter;

this first group of steps being followed by a second group
of steps having the following steps :


E) the application of pressure to said electronic
element (14) so that this latter at least partially

penetrates said structure (56;60); 
F) the provision of energy serving to at least
partially melt said structure (56;60);
G) the application of pressure to said structure in
the direction of said working surface so that said fusible

material of said structure forms a mass (32;42;38) in
which said electronic element is embedded;

this second group of steps being followed by a step of
solidification of said mass.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said first group of steps also has the following

step :

A) the provision, to said working surface (2), of an
outer layer (8;44) and positioning of this outer layer so

that said electronic element (14) and said structure
(10;46;56;60) are located on this outer layer.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that said first group of steps also has the following

step :

D) the provision of an outer layer (18) and
positioning of said outer layer onto said electronic

element (14) and onto said structure (10;46;56;60).
Process according to claim 3 or 4, characterized
in that said steps F and G also serve to firmly bind said

outer layer (8;18;44) to said mass (38;42) once this
latter has solidified.
Process according to claim 3 or 4, characterized
in that said structure (10) forms a single and same piece

(6) with said outer layer (8).
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that said positioning zone is defined by a main opening

(48) provided in said structure (46).
Process according to claim 2, characterized in
that said structure (60) has a first part (62) and a

second part (64), said electronic element (14) being
placed between these first and second parts.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in
that said working surface (2) is planar and in that said 

structure (10), once applied, presents, in a plane (26)
substantially parallel to said working surface (2), a

relief, the extreme points of which (22) substantially
define a plane (24) parallel to said working surface (2).
Process according to claim 9, characterized in
that said relief is compo
sed of an assembly of pyramids
(20).
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
