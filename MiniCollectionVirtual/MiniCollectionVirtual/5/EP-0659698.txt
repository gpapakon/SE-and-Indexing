<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method and apparatus for providing 
reactant vapors to a utilization site. The apparatus 

includes a vaporization chamber enclosed by top and bottom 
walls, side walls and first and second end walls. The 

first end wall is elevated with respect to the second end 
wall. The reactant is supplied in liquid form to a flow 

distributor that delivers the liquid to that portion of the 
bottom wall near the first end wall. The angle with which 

the bottom wall is inclined with respect to horizontal is 
sufficient to cause the liquid to flow down the bottom wall 

at a rate sufficient to form a film, the thickness of which 
is smaller than that thickness which would support
 a bubble 
during heating of the film. The surface is heated to a 

temperature greater than the boiling point of the liquid, 
thereby converting the liquid reactant to a vapor that is 

delivered to the vapor utilization site.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vaporizer for 
delivering vaporized reactants to a reaction zone, and to a 
method of using such vaporizer. Preforms from which optical fibers can be drawn are 
frequently made by reacting vapors and depositing the 
resulting glass particles. In order to form preforms, e.g. optical waveguide 
preforms, having generally consistent properties, and to 
assure an even distribution of the glass particles, it is 
necessary to supply the burner with a substantially 
constant flow of vaporized source material entrained in a 
carrier gas, such as O2, i.e. pressure spikes should be 
minimized. Moreover, the rate of change of flow of vapor 
should accurately track any change in vapor demand 
initiated by the control system. For control, the reactant 
flow can be measured in the vapor state, or in the liquid 
state. In the system disclosed in US-A-4 529 427, the metered reactants and oxygen are 
supplied to a flash evaporation chamber in controlled 
amounts; the liquid is sprayed onto a heated surface 
whereby immediate vaporization occurs, thereby causing 
undesirable nucleate or film boiling. The vaporized output 
from this system slowly responds to the input liquid flow 
since the chamber volume needs to be large to permit the 
liquid to be sprayed onto or toward the heated plate.  
 
Thus, a step change in the flow of boron-containing 
reactant, for example, would not produce a step change in 
the amount of boron-containing particles deposited on the 
preform. US-A-5 090 985 discloses a reactant vaporizer which employs a chamber 
including a cylindrical inner wall; reactants are fed to 
one end of the cylindrical chamber, and a thin film is 
formed by rotating blades. Since the blade shaft passes 
through an end wall of the chamber, the chamber is subject 
to leaking at the seal. Film thickness is essentially 
determined by the gap between the blades and the inner 
wall. It would appear that part of the film would not be 
thin since there would be a thick portion (like a wave) 
adjacent the stirrer until axial flow made the film thinner 
than the gap between the blade and inner wall. Liquid 
running down the blade could form droplets that could be 
carried in the vapor stream. Faster blade rotation would 
worsen the effect. Another disadvantage is slow response 
time, the volume within the cylindrical chamber being 
relatively large. The cylindrical vaporizer disclosed in EP-A-0 434 966 includes a cylindrical 
heating rod that is situated within a cavity located within 
a
