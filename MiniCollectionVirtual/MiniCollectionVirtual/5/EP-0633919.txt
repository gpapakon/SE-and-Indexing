9 for bonding non-pretreated polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride or metals,

more particularly copper, lead and aluminium, to one another or to materials
of the same type, PVC with a pronounced tendency towards plasticizer

migration being preferred.
The use of the hotmelt adhesive claimed in at least one of claims 1 to
9 for co-extrusion with polyethylene or polypropylene.
Shrinkable mouldings coated on at least one side with the hotmelt
adhesive claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 9, the mouldings preferably

being based on crosslinked polyethylene or polypropylene.
