<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device having solder bumps with improved affinity between
pad electrodes and solder bumps, and to a process for
manufacturing this device.Semiconductor devices using a resin substrate having
a number of electrodes have been developed along with
high density mounting of IC chips in recent years. A
typical example of such a semiconductor device is the
pin-glid array (hereinafter abbreviated to PGA). PGA has
a construction in which IC chips are mounted on one side
and sealed with a resin, and a number of pins are
provided on the other side. Although PGA has an
advantage that it is attachable to and removable from the
mother board, it is large in size because of the use of
pins. It is difficult to fabricate it small, and there
are thus limitations to high density mounting.Ball-glid array (hereinafter abbreviated to BGA) has
been developed as a small-type resin sealing
semiconductor device with an expectation of being
replaced for PGA. A general construction of BGA is 
illustrated by reference to the drawings.Outline for manufacturing a conventional BGA is
first described with reference to Figures 10(a) to 10(d),
Figure 11, and Figure 12.Figures 10(a) to 10(d) are sectional views of resin
substrate 1 in each step of manufacturing conventional
BGA, Figure 11 is a sectional view of resin substrate as
completed, and Figure 12 is an enlarged sectional view of
a main portion sectioned along line X-X of Figure 11 and
shows a multi-layer construction of plated metals on said
resin substrate 1.As shown in Figure 10(a), resin substrate 1 is
formed from a glass epoxy resin or the like with a
thickness of about 0.2 mm. The resin substrate 1 has a
laminated copper foil (see Figure 11) with a thickness of
18 µm on both the upper and lower sides, and further a
number of through-holes 2 provided therethrough by a
cutting drill or the like. The surfaces of resin
substrate 1, together with walls of through-holes 2, are
washed and the whole surface is plated electrolytically
and non-electrolytically to form a copper layer 3. This
copper layer 3 is provided also inside the through-holes
2.A plating resist is then laminated on the resin
substrate 1, and the resist is irradiated and developed 
to form a pattern mask, following which pattern etching
is performed using CuCl2 + H2O2 which is a common circuit
board etching solution. In this manner, an acrylic type
dry film 4 is formed on the parts, excluding at least the
parts where IC chips, bonding wires, and solder bumps are
joined.
