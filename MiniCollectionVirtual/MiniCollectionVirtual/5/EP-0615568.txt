<ABSTRACT>
Process for making non-bearing partition walls for buildings in which a core (3-8) in the form of a longitudinal strip of longitudinal tiles (4, 4'), blocks or the like with at least one continuous longitudinal channel is laid out in rows on a first covering layer (2) and a further covering layer (2') is laid on this core, thus forming a sandwich construction in the form of a longitudinal strip from which pieces of predetermined length are cut off to form partition wall sections. The core consists of two layers (3, 7) or rows of tiles. The longitudinal channels (5) of all the tiles (4) in the first layer (3) run in the longitudinal direction of the strip and the longitudinal channels (5') of all the tiles (4') in the second layer (7) run across the strip.

<CLAIMS>
Method of producing non-load-bearing partition walls 
for building construction, in which a core (3-7) of elongated 

bricks, blocks or the like, which are provided with at least 
one elongated channel and which are laid out in brick rows, is 

applied onto a first facing layer (2) in the form of an 
elongated web, and a further facing layer (2') is applied to 

the said core so that a sandwich body in the form of an 
elongated web is formed, of which portions of a predetermined 

length (L) are severed to form the partition walls, 
characterized in that as a core two layers of brick rows are 

applied, wherein in a first layer (3) all bricks (4) with their 
elongated channels extend in the longitudinal direction of the 

web and in the second layer (7) all bricks (4') with their 
elongated channels extend in the transverse direction of the 

web, and wherein after severing of the portions of 
predetermined length (L) apertures between the first and the 

second layer (3, 7) are formed at the locations of bends of 
installation conduits. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
reinforcing fabric is additionally folded around the core, the 

web projecting at least on one longitudinal side of the 
sandwich body to form a loop.
