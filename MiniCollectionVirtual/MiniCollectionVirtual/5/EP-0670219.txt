<ABSTRACT>
A printing head has a plurality of heater boards, 
each of which includes a shift register to which 

printing data and selection data for selecting 
preheating pulse signals are applied as inputs, a latch 

circuit for latching the printing data, a selection-data 
latch circuit for latching the selection data, a 

selection circuit for selecting any one of a plurality 
of preheating pulse signals inputted in accordance with 

the latched selection data, and a plurality of heating 
resistors driven by the printing data or preheating 

pulse signals. Correction data, obtained by a head 
correcting apparatus, for performing printing at an 

average density by correcting the characteristics of 
each heater board is stored in a memory of the printing 

head. A printing apparatus decides the selection data 
in accordance with the correction data and sets the 

selection data in the selection-data latch circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elongated printing
head having a plurality of printing elements, a printing
method and apparatus using this printing head, and an
apparatus and method for correcting the printing head.A printing apparatus such as a printer, copying
machine or facsimile machine prints an image comprising
a dot pattern on a printing medium such as paper, a thin
plastic sheet or cloth based upon image information.
Among these printing apparatus, those which are the
focus of attention because of their low cost make use of
printing heads that rely upon the ink jetting method,
the thermal printing method or LED method, etc., in
which a plurality of printing elements corresponding to
dots are arrayed on a substrate.In a printing head in which printing elements such
as heating resistors or nozzles are arrayed to
correspond to a certain printing width, the printing
elements can be formed through a process similar to that
used to manufacture semiconductors. Accordingly, a 
transition is now being made from a configuration in
which the printing head and driving integrated circuitry
are arranged separately of each other to a configuration
in which the driving integrated circuitry is formed on
the board of the head on which the printing elements are
arrayed. As a result, complications in driving the
printing head can be avoided and the printing apparatus can
be reduced in size and cost.Among these types of printing methods, the ink-jet
printing method is particularly advantageous. According
to this method, thermal energy is made to act upon ink
and the ink is jetted by utilizing the pressure produced
by thermal expansion. This method is advantageous in
that the response to a printing signal is good and it is
easy to group the discharge ports together at a high
density. There are greater expectations for this method
in comparison with the other methods.However, when the printing head is manufactured
through a process used to manufacture semiconductors, as
mentioned above, numerous printing elements to be made
to correspond to the printing width are arrayed over the
entire area of a board, and therefore it is very
difficult to manufacture all of the printing elements
without any defects. As a consequence, the
manufacturing yield of the printing head is poor and
this is accompanied by higher manufacturing cost. It is 
very difficult to achieve such a printing head in
practice.Accordingly, methods of manufacturing an elongated
printing head have been disclosed in the specifications
of Japanese Patent
