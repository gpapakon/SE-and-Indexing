<ABSTRACT>
A sputtering target (20) having plastically deformed grains 
(22) is etched with a wet chemical etchant to remove at 

least a portion of the plastically deformed grains (22) 
from the surface of the target (20). After etching, the 

target (20) is mounted in a sputtering zone, and material 
is sputtered from the target (20) onto a substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sputtering processes and 
sputtering targets. Conductive metal films, such as aluminum films are used to 
interconnect devices in VLSI (very large scale integration) circuits. One 
method of depositing conductive films onto substrates is by sputtering, also 
known as physical vapor deposition (PVD). In sputtering processes, a sputtering target is bombarded by 
energetic ions, such as a plasma, causing material to be knocked off the 
target and deposited as a film on the substrate. The crystallographic 
orientation of the grains in the target affects the distribution of material 
ejected from the target. Thus, the sputtering target must have a uniform 
crystalline structure for the sputtering process to produce a uniform and 
homogeneous film. Typically, the sputtering targets are disc shaped, being 
mechanically machined to size using processes such as lathing or milling. 
These machining processes produce shearing forces on the surface of the 
target. With reference to Figure 1a, the shearing forces on the target 
20 plastically deform the grains 22 on the surface of the target 20 to produce 
a "smeared" surface grain structure 24. By "plastic deformation" it is meant 
that adjacent planes of atoms within the grains 22 slip over one another 
resulting in a permanent lateral displacement of the atomic planes relative to  
 
one another, as described in Van Vlack, Elements of Materials Science, 2d 
Ed., Addison-Wesley Publ. Co. (1964), pages 142-160. The plastically deformed grains on the target can cause 
unstable deposition conditions. The smeared grain structure causes the 
sputtering rate and the properties of the sputtered film to vary with sputtering 
time. This results in deposition of films with non-uniform thicknesses and 
properties. In order to obtain stable sputtering conditions and uniform films, 
it is necessary to remove the plastically deformed grains on the target. A known method of removing the plastically deformed grains 
comprises an in situ sputter etching process. In this process, the target is 
mounted in a sputtering chamber, process gas is introduced into the 
chamber, and a plasma is generated to etch the target until the plastically 
deformed grains on the target are removed. Removal of the deformed 
grains is detected by sputtering films onto test wafers and by examining the 
deposited films to determine their uniformity. Generally, at least about 
100 test wafers must be processed to remove a sufficient thickness of the 
target. The in situ
