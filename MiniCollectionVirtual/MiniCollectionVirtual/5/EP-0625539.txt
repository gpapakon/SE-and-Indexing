<ABSTRACT>
A thermal lamination polyester film with a melting point of 150-250 
o
C, a diethylene glycol content of 0.01-1 
wt.% and an intrinsic viscosity [η]
 of 0.7 or above, which has moldability and impact resistance heretofore unattainable 
and is excellent in adhesion and flavor retention, thus being suitable as a wrapping material and a container liner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester film
for thermal lamination which excels not only in
adhesiveness and impact resistance, but also in
shapability and taste characteristics. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a
polyester film for thermal lamination suited for metal
cans produced by forming.The term "thermal lamination" with a film in the
present invention means to laminate the film on a
substrate such as a metal or a non-metal (paper,
plastics, fibers, non-woven fabric or the like) wherein
the substrate or the film is heated to continuously
adhere the both to form a composite.Particularly, methods for laminating a film on a
metal plate are drawing attention with the recent
increase in the production of metal cans.Conventionally, in order to prevent corrosion of
inner surface of metal cans, it is widely performed to
apply solutions or dispersions of various thermosetting
resins such as epoxy resins and phenol resins in a
solvent to the inner surface of metal cans to coat the
inner surface. However, with this method by which the
inner surface is coated with a thermosetting resin, a 
long time is required for drying the coating liquid, so
that the production efficiency is low. Further,
environmental pollution by the large amount of organic
solvents is problematic.To overcome these problems, a polyester film is
laminated on a steel plate, aluminum plate or on a steel
or aluminum plate whose surface is treated in wide
variety of manners such as plating, and a metal can is
prepared from the metal plate laminated with the film by
drawing or ironing. The following
characteristics are demanded for the polyester film:
(1) The film has a good adhesion to a metal plate.(2) The film has a good shapability and voids such as
pin holes are not formed after being shaped.(3) The polyester film is not peeled off and cracks and
pin holes are not formed in the film by an impact to the
metal can.(4) Smelling components of the content in the can are
not adsorbed by the polyester film, and the taste of the
content is not deteriorated by a component eluted from
the polyester film (This property is hereinafter referred
to as "taste characteristics").To satisfy these demands, a number of proposals have
been made. For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent
Application (Kokai) No. 2-305827 discloses a polyester
film having a specific coefficient of planar orientation,
and Japanese Laid-open Patent Application (Kokai) No. 2-57339 
discloses a copolymerized polyester film having a
specific crystallinity.
