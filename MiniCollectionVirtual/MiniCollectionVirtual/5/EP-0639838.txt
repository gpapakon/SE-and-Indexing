<ABSTRACT>
An electrically conductive moulding made of thermoplastic material is at the same time reinforced by glass fibers and steel fibres. The quantity of glass fibres is preferably dimensioned such that the specific conductivity is at least 10% greater than in the case of a moulding in which the glass fibres are replaced by the thermoplastic material. The moulding can be used for the screening of electromagnetic fields.

A process for the production of an electrically
conductive shaped article using steel fibers,


characterized in that
 it comprises incorporating
strands of steel fibers into a thermoplastic

material by pultrusion, cutting the material to
chips, admixing chips which comprise glass fibers

in a thermoplastic material and shaping the chip
mixture thermally under the action of pressure, the

length of the glass fibers in the shaped article
being below 20 mm and the material of the shaped

article comprising less than 20% by weight of steel
fibers and less than 60% by weight of glass fibers.
A process for the production of an electrically
conductive shaped article using steel fibers,


characterized in that
 it comprises incorporating
strands of continuous glass and steel fibers into a

thermoplastic material by pultrusion, cutting the
material to chips and shaping the chips thermally

under pressure, the length of the glass fibers in
the shaped article being below 20 mm and the

material of the shaped article comprising less than
20% by weight of steel fibers and less than 60% by

weight of glass fibers.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
weight ratio of steel fibers to glass fibers is in

the range from 2:1 to 1:2. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 various mutually miscible base polymers are
used for the thermoplastic material into which the

steel fibers are incorporated and for the thermoplastic
material which contains the glass fiber.
A process for the production of an electrically
conductive shaped article using steel fibers,


characterized in that
 it comprises incorporating
strands of continuous glass and steel fibers into a

thermoplastic material by pultrusion, cutting the
material to chips and shaping the chips thermally

under pressure, the length of the glass fibers in
the shaped article being in general below 20 mm.
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to
5, 
characterized in that
 the base polymers used for
the thermoplastic materials are polycarbonates,

acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene copolymers, blends
of polycarbonates and acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene

copolymers, polypropylene, polyamide 66,
polybutylene terephthalate or polyphenylene

sulfide.
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to

6, 
characterized in that
 the thermal shaping under
pressure of the chips comprising steel and glass

fibers is effected by extrusion, by a plasticizing/stretching/pressing
process or by injection

molding.
