<ABSTRACT>
A method for microencapsulating agriculturally active 
substances such as pesticides to provide improved resistance to 

environmental degradation, especially ultra-violet light. The 
method employs as the UV protectant lignosulfonates, such as 

sulfite lignin or sulfonated lignin, or alternately sulfonated 
lignite, sulfonated tannins, napthalene sulfonates or other 

related compounds in combination with a protein such as a high 
bloom gelatin to form a capsule wall. The capsule wall formed by 

the interaction of these components is durable and has an ultra-violet 
protectant as an integral part of its structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
microencapsulating agriculturally active substances and, more
specifically, to the production of microencapsulated chemical
and/or biological actives having improved resistance to
environmental degradation, especially that caused by exposure to
ultra-violet (UV) light. Said actives can be any UV sensitive
synthetic or natural or biologically derived pesticide.The use of microencapsulation as a means of controlling
the release of actives, of improving handling via reduced toxicity
and of improving environmental stability has been documented.
Without such protection, the effectiveness of such actives can be
drastically reduced by numerous factors including volatilization
and degradation caused by exposure to ultra-violet light. By use
of the process described herein, the resistance of UV sensitive
chemical and/or biological actives to such losses can be greatly
reduced.A number of microencapsulation systems have been
proposed for providing protection of agriculturally active
substances.One method suggested in U.S. Patent No. 3,839,561
utilizes diisophorone derivatives to protect active cyclopropane
carboxylic acid compounds from ultra-violet induced
degradation. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 4,094,969 describes the
use of a sulfonated copolymer of catechin and leucocyanidin as a
UV stabilizer. In both cases, however, the formulations
suggested do not maintain the sunscreen and active in close
enough contact to be effective. In U.S. Patent No. 3,242,051, a method for coating
materials by phase separation is described. Gelatin and various
carboxylated polymers such as gum acacia and ethyl cellulose are
used to form the coating. The use of a similar
ethylcellulose/gelatin system is described by Ignoffo and Batzer
in "Microencapsulation and Ultraviolet Protectants to Increase
Sunlight Stability of an Insect Virus", J. of Econ. Entomology,
Vol. 64, pp. 850-853 (1966), and the use of a chlorophyll
green/gelatin system is described in U.S. Patent No. 2,090,109.
In these cases, however, the materials have less than desirable
environmental stability. Another disadvantage of these polymers
is that they are not always capable of keeping the sunscreening
agent within the capsule wall.Encapsulation of actives by interfacial polycondensation is
described in U.S. Patent No. 4,280,833 and 4,417,916. The
actives thus formed have a skin or thin wall of polyurea which
improves release characteristics and environmental stability. In
the process, lignin sulfonate is used as an

<CLAIMS>
A method for encapsulating an ultra-violet sensitive agriculturally active pesticide
in protective capsule wall, comprising the steps of:


i. dissolving a protein and an ultra-violet protectant lignosulfonate, sulfonate
lignite, sulfonated tannin, naphthalene sulfonate, condensed naphthalene

sulfonate and/or azolignosulfonate, the ultra-violet protectant being in a
solution having a pH of 6.0 to 8.5;
ii. mixing a pesticide in said solution to form an emulsion;
iii. acidifying the resulting emulsion to a pH close to the isoelectric point of the
protein by controlled addition of acid to form a coacervated mixture

containing a protein/ultra-violet protectant complex as a capsule wall;
iv. transferring the coacervated mixture to a chilled water bath and
v. isolating said capsules.
A method as claimed in claim 1 which further includes the step of hardening the
capsule wall prior to isolating said capsules.
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the step of hardening comprises adding a
crosslinking agent to said chilled water bath, which crosslinking agent is preferably one

or more of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, malonic acid dialdehyde
and/or glyoxal.
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein the step of isolating said
capsules comprises filtration.
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, which further includes the step of
neutralising said coacervated mixture prior to isolating said capsules.
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the pesticide is one of a synthetically
prepared pesticide, a naturally derived pesticide, and a biologically derived pesticide. 
A method as claimed in claim 6 wherein the pesticide is one of:

a pyrethroid, and preferably is selected from allethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin,
fenothrin, flucythrinate and indothrin;
an organophosphonate, and preferably is selected from crufomate, dursban,
dicrotophos, parathion and phorate;
pyrethrum; and
one or more of a virus, a bacterium, a nematode and/or a fungi, and preferably
is a nuclear polyhedrosis virus and is selected from 
Heliothis zea, H.
virescens, Lymantrai dispar, Orgai pseudotsufata, Neodiprion sertifer,

and 
Autographa californica
