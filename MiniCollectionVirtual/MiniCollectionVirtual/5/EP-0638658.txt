Martensitic stainless steel comprising:

a - from 0.5 to 0.85% by weight carbon + nitrogen
b - from 0.15 to 0.24% by weight nitrogen
c - from 0 to 0.50% by weight silicon
d - from 0 to 0.70% by weight manganese
e - from 0 to 0.50% by weight nickel
f - from 14 to 17% by weight chromium
g - from 1 to 2.5% by weight molybdenum
h - from 0.20 to less than 1% by weight vanadium

the remaining fraction consisting of iron and residues
and the respective contents of each of these elements

being determined so as to limit the residual austenite
content to a value less than 10% by volume and to obtain

a Rockwell C hardness greater than or equal to HRC 58
after heat treatment.
Steel as described in claim 1, characterised by the
fact that the vanadium content is between 0.20 and 0.70%.
Steel as described in claim 1 or 2, characterised by
the fact that the nitrogen content is between 0.18 and

0.23% by weight.
Steel as described in one of the preceding claims,
characterised by the fact that the carbon content is

between 0.30 and 0.60% by weight.
Steel as described in one of the preceding claims,
characterised by the fact that the carbon + nitrogen

content is between 0.55 and 0.80% by weight.
Steel as described in one of the preceding claims,
characterised by the fact that the size of the carbides 

is less than or equal to 40 µm.
Process for the manufacture of a martensitic
nitrogen stainless steel with a low carbon content

comprising in particular the steps of preparation of a
metallic bath, refinement of this bath into steel in the

liquid state, casting the steel into ingots and
thermomechanical transformation of the solidified ingots,

characterised by the fact that the carbon content in the
liquid steel is lowered to values between 0.30 and 0.60%

by total weight of the steel and to it is added a
quantity of nitrogen such that it does not exceed the

limit of solubility of the latter in the liquid steel.
Process as described in claim 7, characterised by
the fact that the
 total content of carbon and nitrogen is
adjusted to a value between 0.50 and 0.85% of the weight

of the steel.
Process as described in claim 7 or 8, characterised
by the fact that the residual austenite content is

limited to a value lower than 10% by volume.
Process as described in one of claims 7 to 9,
characterised by the fact that the nitrogen is introduced

into the liquid steel in gaseous form by bubbling.
Process as described in one of claims 7 to 9,
characterised by the fact that the nitrogen is introduced

in solid form by nitrided charges.
Process as described in one of claims 7 to 11,
characterised by the fact that the partial pressure of

nitrogen over the liquid steel is maintained at a value
less than or equal to 1 bar.
Process as described in one of claims 7 to 12, 
characterised by the fact that after thermomechanical

transformation a heat treatment is carried out comprising
a pre-heating step to an austenisation temperature of

between 1020°C and 1070°C followed by quenching and then
a tempering cycle between 130°C and 180°C for 2 hours.
Process as described in one of claims 7 to 12,
characterised by the fact that after thermomechanical

transformation a heat treatment is carried out comprising
a pre-heating step to an austenisation temperature

between 1070°C and 1120°C followed by quenching and then
a double tempering cycle between 500°C and 525°C for 2

hours.
Process as described in either of claims 13 or 14,
characterised by the fact that, after quenching and

before tempering, a cryogenic treatment is carried out at
-80°C.
Use of a steel as described in one of claims 1 to 6,
to make mechanical parts, ball bearings, surgical tools,

or those intended for the chemical or agro-nutritional
industries, or for the transformation of plastics

materials.
