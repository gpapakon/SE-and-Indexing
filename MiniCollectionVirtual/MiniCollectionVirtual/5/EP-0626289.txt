is mounted in its upper zone on the backrest support (40) for 
movement, and is connected in its lower zone to the second squab 

body (24) for displacement in its upper zone when the second 
squab body (24) is folded up, so as to produce at least approximately 

the continuous original face (28) of the backrest, and the
