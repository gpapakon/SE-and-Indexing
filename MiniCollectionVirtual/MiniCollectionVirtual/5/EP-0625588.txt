<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a plasma polymer layer set as sintered material coat on substrates having a functional layer and, if appropriate, an interlayer and a gradient layer, the functional layer also containing, in addition to the base elements, non-metallic or semi-metallic elements from main groups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and/or 7 of the Periodic Table of the elements and being obtainable via conventional PVD or CVD processes, for example a plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PEVCD) process, to a possible preparation variant thereof and to some possible applications. According to the invention, this plasma polymer layer set is described in such a way that the non-metallic or semi-metallic elements, contained in the functional layer in addition to the base elements, from the main groups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and/or 7 of the Periodic Table of the elements are incorporated into the functional layer in such a way that the level of the polar and/or disperse proportion of these functional layers is adjusted to a defined value as a function of the polar and/or disperse level of the surface energy of the gaseous, liquid and/or solids, with which these layers are contacted, and of the desired adhesion behaviour.

Process for the production of a plasma polymer layer
sequence on a substrate by means of a plasma enhanced

chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) process, comprising an
outermost function layer and an intermediate layer

possibly disposed between the substrate and function
layer, said function layer being configured as a hard

material layer, which contains the base elements carbon
(C) and hydrogen (H) as well as the supplementary

elements silicon (Si) and oxygen (O),
characterised in that

the reactive gas for deposition of the hard material
layer is composed of a mixture of hexamethyl disiloxane

(HMDSO) and oxygen and the thus produced function layer
has a wetting rate relative to water of 43 to 50%.
Process according to Claim 1,
characterised in that

to improve adhesion of the function layer on the
substrate, an intermediate layer serving to promote

adhesion between the substrate and function layer is
deposited before feeding the reactive gas into the

process, whereby the change in process atmosphere between
deposition of the intermediate layer and deposition of

the function layer occurs without interruption.
Process according to Claim 2,
characterised in that

the transition from the process atmosphere forming the
pure intermediate layer to the process atmosphere forming

the pure function layer occurs in steps so that a
gradient layer is deposited between the intermediate

layer and the function layer. 
Process according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that

the intermediate layer serving to promote adhesion is
deposited from an acetylene or a tetramethylsilane

atmosphere.
Layer sequence on a substrate, which may be obtained
according to one of the processes mentioned above,

wherein the outermost function layer

is configured as a hard material layer,
has carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) as base elements,
also contains silicon (Si) and oxygen (O) in
addition to the base elements carbon (C) and

hydrogen (H) , and
has a wetting rate relative to water of 43 to 50%.
Layer sequence according to Claim 5,
characterised in that

an intermediate layer is disposed under the function
layer to improve adhesion.
Use of the layer sequence according to Claim 5 or 6 as
protective layers.
Use according to Claim 7 as protective layers in the
household appliance industry, in the food industry, in

the paint and printing industry, in general machine
construction and in medical engineering.
Use according to one of Claims 7 or 8 as protective
layers against dirt and/or calcification and/or

lubrications.
Use according to Claim 9 as protective layer on heating
elements in washing machines.
