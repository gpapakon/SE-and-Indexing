<ABSTRACT>
A generally block-shaped valve comprises a gas feed 
passage (6) possessing an inlet (6a) and an outlet (6b), 

a branch passage 7 possessing an outlet (7a) branched off 
and communicating with the gas feed passage (6), a body 

(1) having a tank or chamber (8) formed in the midst of 
the branch passage (7), a first valve (2) provided in the 

body (1) for opening and closing the downstream side of 
the gas feed passage (6) at the downstream side of the 

place of connection with the branch passage (7) and a 
second valve (3) provided in the body (1) for opening and 

closing the branch passage (7) at the upstream side of 
the tank/chamber (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a valve assembly for handling
high purity gas used mainly in semiconductor
manufacturing apparatus and the like. More particularly,
it sets out to provide a valve, usually block-shaped,
which is connected to the outlet side of other valves
incorporated in the pipings so as to discharge promptly
and smoothly the residual gas in the pipings in which the
valves are incorporated. A fluid flow control valve assembly comprising
a gas feed passage possessing an inlet and an outlet, and which is suitable for a
semiconductor manufacturing apparatus, is disclosed in US-A-5145152.Generally, the pipings for feeding gas to a process
chamber for forming a film on a wafer, which is an
essential part in a semiconductor manufacturing
apparatus, is constituted as shown in Figure 6, in which
a plurality of block-shaped valves 40 in a structure of
integrally combining plural valves are incorporated into
gas feed pipings leading to the process chamber (not
shown), and by properly controlling the valves 40,
various gases G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 are alternately supplied
into the process chamber through the block 40.In Figure 6, reference numeral 41 is a branch pipe
connected to the gas feed pipings, 42 is a valve
installed in the branch pipe 41, and 43 is a vacuum pump
connected to the branch pipe 41. The pipings into which the valves 40 are incorporated can
be smaller in the inner volume of the pipe passage as
compared with pipings into which a plurality of single
valves are incorporated, and hence advantages are
exhibited, for instance, the gas replacement performance
is enhanced and generation of particles can be prevented.In the process chamber used in semiconductor manufacture,
it is necessary to change the type of the gas to be
supplied inside, or discharge the gas from the process
chamber. For this purpose, it is necessary to discharge
also the residual gas in the pipings (the thick line
portions in Figure 6) where the valves 40 are
incorporated.To discharge the residual gas in the pipings where the
valves 40 are incorporated, in the conventional method,
first the supply of gas is stopped, and then the residual
gas is discharged by using the vacuum pump 43 and the
branch pipe 41 connected to the gas feed pipings at the
downstream side of the block valves 40.However, if the inner volume of the pipings is relatively
large, when the closing valve 42 provided at the intake
side of the vacuum pump 43 is opened during continuous
operation for discharging the residual gas, the degree
of vacuum at the
