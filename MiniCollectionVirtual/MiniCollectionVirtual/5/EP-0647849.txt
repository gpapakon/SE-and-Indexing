<ABSTRACT>
Method for detecting the presence of an analyte in a sample by immobilising 
the analyte, removing the immobilised analyte from the sample, contacting the 

removed immobilised analyte with a labelled antibody able to form a complex 
containing the analyte, and detecting the presence of the analyte by detecting the 

presence of the complexed labelled antibody. Kits and a reactor suitable for use with 
the method are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
Within this application several publications are referenced 
by Arabic numerals within parentheses. Full 
citations for these references may be found at the end 
of the specification immediately preceding the claims. 
The disclosures of these publications in their entirety 
are hereby incorporated by reference into this application 
in order to more fully describe the state of the 
art to which this invention pertains. There is a continuous and expanding need for rapid, 
highly specific methods, of detecting and quantifying 
chemical, biochemical, and biological substances. Of 
particular value are methods for measuring small quantities 
of pharmaceuticals, metabolites, microorganisms 
and other materials of diagnostic value. Examples of 
such materials include narcotics and poisons, drugs 
administered for therapeutic purposes, hormones, pathogenic 
microorganisms and viruses, antibodies, metabolites, 
enzymes and nucleic acids. The presence of these materials can often be determined 
by binding methods which exploit the high degree of 
specificity which characterizes many biochemical and 
biological systems. Frequently used methods are based 
on, for example, antigen-antibody systems, nucleic acid 
hybridization techniques, and protein-ligand systems. 
In these methods, the existence of a complex of diagnostic 
value is typically indicated by the presence or 
absence of an observable "label" which has been attached 
to one or more of the complexing materials.  The specific labeling method chosen often dictates the 
usefulness and versatility of a particular system for 
detecting a material of interest. A preferred label 
should be inexpensive, safe, and capable of being attached 
efficiently to a wide variety of chemical, biochemical, 
and biological materials without changing the 
important binding characteristics of those materials. 
The label should give a highly characteristic signal, 
and should be rarely, and preferably never, found in 
nature. The label should be stable and detectable in 
aqueous systems over periods of time ranging up to 
months. Detection of the label should be rapid, sensitive, 
and reproducible without the need for expensive, 
specialized facilities or personnel. Quantification 
of the label should be relatively independent of variables 
such as temperature and the composition of the 
mixture to be assayed. Most advantageous are labels 
which can be used in homogeneous systems, i.e., systems 
in which separation of the complexed and uncomplexed 
labeled material is not
