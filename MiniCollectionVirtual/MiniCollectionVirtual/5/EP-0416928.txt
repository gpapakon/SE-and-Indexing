<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an olefin polymerization catalyst 
system of which the procatalyst comprises a solid carrier with a 

magnesium compound, an electron donor compound and monocyclo­
pentadienyl titanium trichloride on its surface. A method for the 

preparation of such a procatalyst is also disclosed, comprising 
impregnating a solid carrier with a solution obtainable by 

dissolving a magnesium compound and monocyclopentadienyl titanium 
trichloride in a compound having electron donor properties. The 

use of the olefin polymerisation catalyst system in a process for 
polymerizing olefins is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to catalyst systems for the polymerization of 
olefins, the procatalyst of which comprises a solid carrier and 
a layer on its surface comprising a titanium compound, a magnesium 
compound and an electron donor. The invention also relates 
to the preparation of such a catalyst system and to 
the use of the catalyst system for the polymerization and copolymerization 
of alphaolefins. For the polymerization of olefins is generally used a so-called 
Ziegler-Natta-catalyst system consisting of a so-called 
procatalyst and a cocatalyst. The procatalyst is based on a compound 
of a transition metal belonging to any of the groups IVB to 
VIII of the periodic table of elements and the cocatalyst is based 
on an organometallic compound of a metal belonging to any of 
the groups IA to IIIA of the periodic table. The catalyst system 
usually also comprises electron donors improving and modifying 
the catalytic properties. In the preparation of heterogenic polymerization catalysts it is 
conventional to use as a component improving the polymerization 
activity of the procatalysts a carrier compound, on which the 
transition metal compound is layered. Common carrier compounds are 
silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, titanium oxide, 
carbon in different forms, and different kinds of polymers. As 
important carrier compounds have proven magnesium compounds, such 
as alkoxides, hydroxides, hydroxyhalides and halides, of which the 
last-mentioned, especially magnesium dichloride, has lately grown 
to the most significant carrier component of the procatalyst compositions. As magnesium halides do not in their basic crystal form become 
activated very efficiently by the transition metal compound, their 
crystal structure must be deformed. Conventionally this takes 
place by grinding e.g. in a ball mill, whereby finely-divided  
 
powder having typically a great specific area is obtained, the 
crystal lattice of which is greatly deformed. When such a powder 
is activated to a procatalyst composition by layering it with a 
transition metal compound and thereafter is reduced with a organometallic 
compound acting as a cocatalyst, a very active polymerization 
catalyst is obtained. A drawback of the conventional grinding methods of magnesium halide 
is, however that they consume very much energy, cause 
wear and corrosion of the equipment and are suitable for the preparation 
of a catalyst by a laborious batch process only. A newer and more efficient manner to decrease the crystallinity
