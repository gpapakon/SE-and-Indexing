<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of metal sulphides by reacting corresponding metal oxides at temperatures between 500 and 1500  DEG C in a stream of gaseous CS2, characterised in that the CS2 is generated from elementary carbon and gaseous H2S by reaction at temperatures between 900 and 1500  DEG C upstream of the metal oxide. The process furnishes metal sulphides of high purity, thus being of specific usefulness in optical glass materials for, e.g., fibre optics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of metal sulphides. Metal sulphides find various uses in technical and scientific applications. For instance, 
several rare earth and other metal sulphides are of specific interest as 
materials or components in optical glasses for the manufacture of, e.g., optical 
fibres and active fibre amplifiers. In this field of application there is an increased 
demand of new materials useful for fibre optics with improved optical properties. 
Typical of such materials are, for example, the sulphides of Lanthanum (La2S3), 
Praseodymium (Pr2S3), Holmium (Ho2S3), Gallium (Ga2S3) and Germanium (GeS2). 
One of the main requirements to be met for optical fibre applications, specifically 
for 1.3 µm fibre optic systems, is ultra high purity of the sulphides, as it is expected 
that an increase in purity of the sulphides could lead to a substantial increase in 
efficiency of the fibre optics. Several methods for the preparation of metal sulphides are known which are based 
on the reaction of the metal or the metal oxide with sulphur, hydrogen sulphide or 
other sulphur containing reagents. For a review of methods for the preparation of 
rare earth metal sulphides, reference is made to Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic 
Chemistry, 8th Edition, Rare Earth Elements - C7, page 69-74, Springer Verlag, 
1983. It is apparent that the methods reported there suffer from severe 
disadvantages, most of all limited applicability and ineffectiveness, and do not 
furnish products of high purity. For instance, high temperature reaction of the metal with sulphur in a sealed silica 
tube works for a limited range of metals only, where the product sulphide is 
miscible with excess metal, permitting a continuous reaction of the elemental 
charge. The partial formation of an insoluble product sulphide, such as La2S3 may 
cause the reaction to cease and leads to rupture of the ampule and explosion.  
 High temperature reaction of the metal with hydrogen sulphide is similarly limited by 
the formation of insoluble surface sulphide which inhibits full progress of the reaction. High temperature reaction of the oxide with hydrogen sulphide and/or sulphur vapour 
is effective with elements such as Group IIa metals only, but may leave a high level 
of several percent of unreacted oxide impurity. It is ineffective in the case of many 
rare earth oxides. Moreover, many of the rare earth oxides require temperatures above 1300 °C in this 
type of reaction which is inconvenient for normal
