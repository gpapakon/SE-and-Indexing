<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a ribbed plate (1) for a composite slab, the profile of which plate consists of protruding ribs (2) formed in an essentially planar plate, the upper flanges of the ribs being surface profiled in order to achieve better adhesion between the ribbed plate and the concrete of the composite slab. According to the invention the surface profiling of the upper flange of each rib (2) consists of spaced apart corrugations (3) extending essentially across the upper flange. Additionally, in the junction of the web of the rib and the upper flange there is formed a protruding longitudinal corrugation (4) extending at least partly along its length.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ribbed plate 
for a composite slab, the profile of which plate 
consists of protruding ribs formed in an essentially 
planar plate, the upper flanges of the ribs being 
surface profiled in order to achieve better adhesion 
between the ribbed plate and the concrete of the composite 
slab, and in which plate the surface profiling of 
the upper flange of each rib is formed of spaced apart 
corrugations extending across the upper flange. In building with composite slabs tens of 
different profiled ribbed plates made of steel sheet are 
being used around the world, the steel sheets differing 
from each other mainly in their outward appearance. One 
of the most popular ribbed plates in Europe is a steel 
ribbed plate provided with dovetail-like ribs. Among the 
best properties of this plate is its favourable 
appearance, because its lower surface is relatively 
smooth, and the possibility of attaching also heavy 
loads in the dovetail grooves of the plate by means of 
special brackets without making holes in the plate 
itself. The weakness of, for example, the dovetail 
profile is, however, an imperfect adhesion to the concrete 
cast on the plate. Attempts to improve the 
adhesion have been made by increasing the pattern, for 
example, protuberances in the upper flange and web of 
the rib. The problem has, however, not been solved, but 
in some cases cost-increasing help measures have been 
necessary, for example, deformation of the rib ends, so 
called heading. Because of the vertical component of the 
adhesion forces and the different bending stiffnesses 
of the ribbed plate and the concrete, the ribbed plate  
 
and the concrete show a tendency to disengage from each other, i. e. they repel 
each other, which for its part makes the adhesion between the ribbed plate 
and the concrete weaker. The weak adhesion and the repulsion reaction lead 
to brittle breaking behaviour. This again has resulted in that reduction coefficients 
of durability have to be used in dimensioning, and essential limitations 
in the plasticity theoretical dimensioning. A ribbed plate for a composite slab is known by DE-B-2 159 959, the profile of 
which plate consists of protruding ribs, the upper part of the ribs having essentially 
planar flanges equipped with surface profiling as deformations or 
nodules. Using a construction of rib with flanges as disclosed in the DE-B-2 
159 959 there is a risk that the thin and wide flange bends when bending force 
is applied to the slab not being able to
