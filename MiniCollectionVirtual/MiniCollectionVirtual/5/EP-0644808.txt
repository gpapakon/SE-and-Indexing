<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to metal powder
compositions containing a lubricant for high temperature
compaction and a binding agent to reduce dusting and
segregation. The invention further relates to methods of
compacting the metal powder compositions at elevated
temperatures to make sintered components.Industrial usage of metal parts manufactured by
the compaction and sintering of metal powder compositions is
expanding rapidly into a multitude of areas. Manufacture of
parts with metal powder compositions provides substantial
benefits in comparison to use of a molten alloy in the
manufacturing process. In the manufacture of such parts,
iron or steel particulate powders are often admixed with at
least one other alloying element that is also in particulate
form. These alloying elements permit the attainment of
higher strength and other mechanical properties in the final
sintered part. The alloying elements typically differ from
the base iron or steel powders in particle size, shape and
density. For example, the average particle size of the
iron-based powders is typically about 70-100 microns, or
more, while the average particle size of most alloying
ingredients can be less than about 20 microns, more often
less than about 15 microns, and in some cases less than
about 5 microns. The alloying powders are purposely used in 
such a finely-divided state to promote rapid homogenization
of the alloy ingredients by solid-state diffusion during the
sintering operation.The disparity in particle size can lead to
problems such as segregation and dusting of the finer
alloying particles during transportation, storage, and use.
Although the iron and alloy element powders are initially
admixed into a homogeneous powder, the dynamics of handling
the powder mixture during storage and transfer can cause the
smaller alloying powder particles to migrate through the
interstices of the iron-based powder matrix. The normal
forces of gravity, particularly where the alloying powder is
denser than the iron powder, cause the alloying powder to
migrate downwardly toward the bottom of the mixture's
container, resulting in a loss of homogeneity of the
mixture, or segregation. On the other hand, air currents
which can develop within the powder matrix as a result of
handling can cause the smaller alloying powders,
particularly if they are less dense than the iron powders,
to migrate upwardly. If these buoyant forces are high
enough, some of the alloying particles can, in the
phenomenon known as dusting, escape the mixture entirely,
