<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a stretch-levelling device for removing gutter curvatures in metal strips (1). This stretch-levelling device has at least one tensioning device with a set (2) of tension rollers and a set (3) of braking rollers. Arranged on the delivery side of the last tension roller (5) is a correction roller (7) which can be adjusted in its depth of intrusion relative to the respective metal strip (1). The correction roller (7) receives actuating signals from an interposed control device (8) as a function of the respectively detected gutter curvature of the metal strip in order to eliminate the said gutter curvature.

<CLAIMS>
A method for eliminating transverse curvatures in 
metal strips (1), in particular thin metal strips having a 

thickness up to 2.0 mm, which in the course of continuous 
straightening are straightened by stretch-bending, and/or 

tension-stretched in a strip processing line, in which the 
transverse curvature is detected following the stretch-bending-straightening 

and/or tension stretching in a strip 
process line region with a substantially lower strip 

tension than that in the stretch-bending-straigthening- and/or 
tension stretching region and is levelled by means 

of a correction roller (7) which is adjustable in its depth 
of engagement characterised in that the levelling of the 

transverse curvature takes place in the strip processing 
line region with the substantially lower strip tension. 
A stretch-straightening installation to carry out 
the method according to claim 1, with at least one set of 

tension rollers (2) and with a set of brake rollers (3) and 
if necessary with at least one stretch-bending roller (4) 

or bending rollers between the set of tension rollers (2) 
and the set of brake rollers (3), in which in the running 

direction of the strip downstream of the last tension 
roller (5) a measurement apparatus (6) is arranged to 

detect the transverse curvature of the respective metal 
strip (1), characterised in that in the running direction  

 
of the strip downstream of the last tension roller (5) a 

correction roller (7) is arranged which is adjustable in 
the depth of engagement against the respective metal strip 

(1), and that the correction roller (7) as a function of 
the respectively detected transverse curvature from an 

intercalated regulating device (8) receives adjustment 
signals to level the transverse curvature. 
A stretch-straightening installation according to 
claim 2, characterised in that the correction roller (7) is 

arranged upstream of the measurement apparatus (6). 
A stretch-straightening installation according to 
claim 2 or 3, characterised in that a correction roller (7) 

is arranged on both sides of the continuous metal strip 
(1). 
A stretch-straightening installation according to 
one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that the correction 

roller (7) or correction rollers are arranged between two 
guide rollers (9).
