<ABSTRACT>
Phellodendrine analogs represented by general formula (I), wherein A represents the group (a); B represents hydrogen, 
lower alkyl or lower acyl, or alternatively A and B together with the adjacent nitrogen atom form a substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 

ring represented by general formula (II), R₁₁, R₁₂, R₂₁, R₂₂, R₃₁ and R₃₂ represent each hydrogen, hydroxyl or 
lower alkoxy; n₁ represents a number of 0 to 2; n₂ represents a number of 1 and 2; and m₁ represents a number of 0 to 1, 

provided tsat when A represents the group (b), and n₂ is 2, B is lower acyl, and that when A and B together form a substituted 
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline ring, n₁ is 1 and m₁ is not 0. These analogs (I) and related compounds have an excellent 

activity of suppressing allergy type IV and hence are utilizable as a medicine efficacious against diseases wherein allergy 
type IV participates, such as chronic hepatitis, intractable asthma, nephrotic syndrome or rheumatism.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
phellodendrine analog and an allergy type IV suppressor 
comprising the same as an active ingredient. There are a number of patients of diseases involving 
allergy type IV, such as chronic hepatitis, intractable 
asthma, nephrotic syndrome, rheumatism, or the like, and 
a great social attentions are given to these diseases. Conventionally, immunosuppressors, typically 
including steroidal agents, which suppress cellular 
antibody production have been used for treating these 
diseases. However, because conventionally used 
immunosuppressors, such as steroidal agents and the like, 
have strong side effects, their use has been restricted. 
Development of an allergy type IV suppressor exhibiting 
minimal side effects and excellent pharmaceutical effects 
has therefore been desired. The present inventors have synthesized a number of 
compounds and undertaken earnest studies on their 
pharmacological actions in order to provide an allergy  
 
type IV suppressor effective for curing diseases 
involving the IV-type allergy, such as chronic hepatitis, 
intractable asthma, nephrotic syndrome, rheumatism, or 
the like. As a result, the present inventors have found 
that novel phellodendrine analogs represented by the 
following formula (I) exhibit excellent actions on 
suppression of the allergy type IV, and completed the 
present invention. Accordingly, a first object of the present invention 
is to provide phellodendrine analogs represented by the 
following formula (I), 
wherein A represents a group 
wherein R₂₁ and R₂₂ individually represent a hydrogen 
atom, a hydroxy group, or a lower alkoxy group; and n2 is 
1 or 2; B represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl 
group, or a lower acyl group, or A and B may form, 
together with the adjacent nitrogen atom, a substituted 
1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolyl ring represented by the 
following formula,  wherein R₃₁ and R₃₂ individually represent a hydrogen 
atom, a hydroxy group, or a lower alkoxy group; R₁₁ and 
R₁₂ individually represent a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy 
group, or a lower alkoxy group; n1 denotes a number 0-2; 
and m1 denotes a number 0-1; provided that when A is 
a group 
if n2 is 2, B is a lower acyl group, and further that 
when A and B together form a substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolyl 
ring, n1 is 1 and m1 is not 0. A second object of the present invention is to 
provide an allergy type IV suppressor comprising a 
phellodendrine analog represented by the above formula 
(I), its related compound, and the
