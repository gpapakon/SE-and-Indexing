<ABSTRACT>
Improvements to a hypodermic needle disposed within a retractable sleeve comprised of a plurality of longitudinal slats extending between a base carrying the needle and an outer end covering the needle's tip. There is a releasable base attaching to a device such as a syringe. The base supports a hard cover used to attach and release the needle and sleeve. A bell end provides a point of sliding on the needle behind the tip and viewing of the tip when transparent. The tip is placed in a pre-established orientation and the sleeve is marked so that the needle can be positioned before the sleeve is retracted. Where a spring-biased collar is used over the sleeve, the base has gripping tabs to hold the spring, the collar has an extended area for sliding stacking of the spring upon retraction, and another extended area for protecting the front holding projections when the sleeve is extended. A dental version has the slats at the rear to fold outward outside the patient's mouth. By reversing the front projections, the sleeve locks up after one use. A strongback adjacent the front end of the sleeve helps in creating a repeatable folding pattern. A gripping ring aids in manually retracting the sleeve. Living hinges also help in creating a repeatable folding pattern. The living hinges may include indentations representing an identification number.

 MEDICAL INJECTION DEVICES WITH SAFETY FEATURESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:This invention relates to medical devices for injecting living bodies and, more particularly, to safety features incorporated therewith. In particular, it relates to improvements to retractable sleeves for protecting hypodermic needles and the like.In United States Patent No. 4,998,922 by Thomas C. Kuracina entitled SAFETY SYRINGE CAP MINIMIZING NEEDLE-STICK PROBABILITY which issued 12 March 1991, a safely device for hypodermic needles and the like is shown. The inventions shown hereinafter are improvements thereto by inventors including and/or working with Mr. Kuracina. In the interest of simplicity herein, the teachings of that patent are incorporated herein by reference and the discussion of the background art will be kept to a minimum.A typical prior art hypodermic syringe 10 as shown in Figure 1 includes a barrel 12 having a moving plunger 14 therein. A needle 16 having a sharp beveled tip 18 extends from the end opposite the end of the barrel 12 into which the plunger 14 is inserted. The needle 16 is covered by a removeable cap 20 for safety purposes. The problem to be solved and avoided is the accidental sticking of users of the syringe 10 by the tip 18 after use where the tip 18 may carry body fluids containing agents of hepatitis B, AIDS, and the like. Accidental needle stick is a very common problem in the health care industry and besides the risk of serious illness or even death as a result thereof, the insurance industry spends over a billion dollars a year in the testing of individuals who have been subjected to post-use needle slick. 

 The 1979 patent of Alvarez proposed a retractable plastic protective sleeve 22 as depicted in Figures 2 and 3. The Alvarez sleeve 22 has an inner hub 24 which fits around the base of the needle 16 and an outer hub 26 through which the tip 18 passes. The inner and outer hubs 24, 26 are connected by curved slats 28. When the needle 16 is to be inserted into the body of a patient, the force required to move the sleeve 22 from its extended position of Figure 2 to its retracted position of Figure 3 is as depicted in the graph of Figure 4. Thus, there is really no 0 ,, actually safety from a large variety of ways in which accidental needle stick takes place. Even if the sleeve 22 fully extends after use, a slight blow against a user or observer in the area will cause the sleeve 22 to retract and the tip 18 to stick the unfortunate person. The action of the basic protective sleeve of the
