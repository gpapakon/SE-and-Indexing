<ABSTRACT>
An improved process is disclosed to prepare an 
carboxylic acid salt. According to the process, an 

aqueous solution of an alcohol is contacted with an 
alkali metal hydroxide in the presence of an effective 

amount of a copper catalyst that contains from about 50 
parts per million to about 10,000 parts per million of 

an element selected from the group consisting of 
chromium, titanium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, 

vanadium, molybdenum, manganese, tungsten, cobalt, 
nickel and mixtures thereof. Raney copper is preferred.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the preparation of 
carboxylic acid salts, and more particularly, relates to 
a method for the preparation of carboxylic acid salts by 
the reaction of primary alcohols with an alkali metal 
hydroxide in the presence of a copper catalyst. Carboxylic acid salts are useful in various 
applications. The salts can be neutralized to the 
corresponding acid which is also useful in a number of 
applications, such as a raw material for 
pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and pesticides. 
Many of such carboxylic acids are available commercially 
in large quantities. U.S. Patent 4,782,183 to Goto et al. discloses 
a method for the manufacture of amino carboxylic acid 
salts which comprises subjecting an amino alcohol to an 
alkali metal hydroxide in the presence of a Raney copper 
catalyst. In a patent application published by WIPO as 
WO 92/06069 on April 16, 1992, a process is disclosed 
for producing glycine, iminodiacetic acid and 
nitrilotriacetic acid salts by contacting monoethanolamine, 
diethanolamine or triethanolamine with an alkali 
metal hydroxide in the presence of a Raney copper 
catalyst, wherein at least some of the Raney copper 
catalyst has been rejuvenated by treating the catalyst 
under reflux conditions with formic acid  
 EP-A- 0 513 396 describes a process to manufacture carboxylic 
acid salts which comprises contacting an aqueous solution of an 
amino alcohol with an alkali metal hydroxide and/or alkaline 
earth metal hydroxide, in the presence of a copper catalyst, 
wherein the reaction is conducted while maintaining the nickel 
concentration of the reaction solution below 40 ppm.  
 A journal article "Structure and Activity of 
Chromium-Promoted Raney Copper Catalyst for Carbon 
Monoxide Oxidation" by Laine et al., Applied Catalysis, 
44 (1-2), pages 11-22, discloses that chromium-promoted  
 
Raney copper catalysts were prepared, and their activity 
for the oxidation of carbon monoxide was measured. The 
surface area of the Raney copper catalyst was directly 
related to the aluminum content in the precursor alloy 
and to a lesser extent to the presence of chromium. 
Bulk cuprous oxide and cupric oxide were detected by X-ray 
diffraction in the Raney copper catalyst. The 
presence of chromium inhibited the formation of cupric 
oxide but not of cuprous oxide. The activity decreased 
as chromium content increased. U.S. Patent 4,810,426 to Fields et al., 
discloses a process for the production of N-phosphonomethylglycine 
by oxidizing
