<ABSTRACT>
The tool is provided with an oblong handle (1), which at one end has a portion (5) for engaging the cap (7) of a preserving jar (8), and a jaw (2) for engaging the lower edge of the cap. The mouth of the jaw is turned away from the other end of the handle, and between the free end (3) of the jaw and the portion (5) for engaging the cap (7) a concave, circular cylindrical guide slot (6) is provided, said guide slot (6) guiding the tool into position against the rim of the cap in such a way that the jaw grips the lower edge of the cap, after which a slight lifting of the handle brings about an elastic deformation of the rim of the cap allowing the vacuum in the preserving jar to be broken.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tool for breaking a vacuum in a preserving jar closed
with a screw cap, said tool comprising an oblong handle of the type disclosed in the
pre-characterising part of claim 1.A tool is known from DE patent application no. 38 22 745. In this tool the portion for
engaging the cap comprises two on the handle essentially perpendicular arms tapering
towards the ends, and in which the edges intended to engage the cap form a small angle
with each other in such a way that each arm only contacts the rounded outer rim of
the cap in a single point.When the tool is used, the jaw is advanced towards the cap, the free end of the jaw
reaching under the edge of the cap while the portion with the two arms abuts the rim
of the cap, the handle extending diametrically across the cap.The handle is then pressed down against the cap to pivot about a line through the two
contact points between said arms and the cap, whereby the jaw is intended to engage
the edge of the cap and deform it elastically and thus break the vacuum in the jar.The tool suffers, however, from the major drawback that the handle, in particular
when used for breaking a vacuum in a jar with a comparatively big diameter, will abut
the upper rim of the cap in a point diametrically opposite the jaw, before the jaw has
lifted the edge of the cap sufficiently, which result in the vacuum not being broken.On account of the shape of the two arms the tool tends to slide away from the cap during
the pivoting movement, which further amplifies the above-mentioned drawback.The tool also suffers from the disadvantage in that it is difficult to simultaneously hold
the tool and to present it to the cap, as the fingers cannot grasp the handle as they
would then be squeezed between the handle and the cap, when the handle is pressed
against the cap.A tool of the type indicated in the pre-characterising part of claim 1 is known from
DE-C-818740. The tool has a hook for engagement with the lower edge of the cap in
order to deform the cap, such that it can be pulled off the bottle. Such a tool is not 
suited for preserving jars closed with screw caps, because it is disadvantageous that
screw caps are deformed which may hinder a satisfactory reuse of the screw cap.The object of the invention is to provide a tool of the type mentioned in the pre-characterising
part of claim 1, which does not have the above-mentioned drawbacks
and which is designed in such a way that the user intuitively understands how to use it.This object is met according to the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A tool for breaking a vacuum in a preserving jar (8) closed with a screw cap (7),
said jar having quadropole or sextopole threads (9) in the neck of the jar, each thread

extending only over a comparatively small part of the circumference of the neck, said
tool comprising


an oblong handle (1),
a mouth portion formed at one end of this handle (1) for engaging the periphery part
of the cap (7),
the mouth portion facing away from the handle (1) and comprising a jaw (2) for engaging
under the lower edge of the cap (7) and a top portion adapted to bear on the

upper surface of the screw cap,
characterised in that
the top portion of the mouth portion has a lower plane surface (5) in the shape of a
circle segment able to span over two thread sections of the screw cap (7),
guide means in the shape of a slot forming a concave circular arc is provided between
the top portion of the mouth portion and the jaw,
the free end (3) of the jaw (2) forms a concave arc of a circle.
A tool according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the top side of the jaw is
parallel to the lower plane surface (5) of the top portion of the mouth portion.
A tool according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the length of the jaw
is adjustable to the height of the edge of the cap.
