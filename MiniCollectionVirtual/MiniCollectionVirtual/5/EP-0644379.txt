<ABSTRACT>
The air depollution device comprises a container (1) 
which has, at opposite ends, an intake grille (6) and an 

emission grille (7), both of which are suitable to convey a 
large stream of air. A mechanical filter (10) and an 

activated-charcoal filter (11) are arranged inside the 
container together with a collection device (12) which is 

arranged downstream of the two filters and has, in 
succession, an electrification grid (16) which is supplied 

with a high voltage of negative polarity and arranged on a 
plane (19) which is transverse to the container, a 

partition (18) arranged at an angle in front of the 
electrification grid so as to convey the stream of air 

toward at least one narrower region, a negatively charged 
deflector plate (20) and a positively charged collector 

plate (21) which face one another at a short distance so as 
to delimit the above-mentioned respective narrower region. 

A germicidal lamp (30), arranged at an opening (28) of the 
deflector plate, is suitable to illuminate the collector 

plate substantially along its entire length in a direction 
which is transverse to the container. Suction means (13) 

are suitable to create the stream of air inside the 
container. An ionizing element (32) is arranged at the 

outgoing stream of air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
depolluting air from fumes, dust, toxic gases, viruses,
bacteria and the like and for restoring the balance of
negative charges in the air.It is known that living spaces are subject to various
forms of pollution, such as industrial emissions, emissions
due to traffic and to heating systems, fumes and the like.In order to remove the pollutants from the air,
filters operating according to various physical principles,
for example mechanical ones, or according to chemical or
electrostatic principles, are currently available. However,
these filters are unable to eliminate pathogenic germs from
the air and to block smaller particles, for example smaller
than one tenth or one hundredth of a micron.It is also known that, besides air purity, an
important factor for physical well-being is constituted by
the presence, in said air, of negative ions, which are
produced by solar radiation, by moving water masses and by
trees. However, air ionization is very limited in enclosed
spaces, due both to pollution and to appliances such as
air-conditioning systems.US-A-5 035 728 discloses a single compact air cleaner
comprising a mechanical pre-filter screen, then an
electrostatic precipitator followed by a main filter
cartridge comprising a synthetic mesh media and a screen
impregnated with activated carbon powder. The device
also comprises a blower and an ionizing element.
Furthermore, GB-A-2 215 234 discloses an air filtering
apparatus comprising a ultraviolet radiator chamber in
order to kill microorganisms.The aim of the present invention is to solve the above
problem, providing a device which allows to fully depollute
the air, particularly blocking even the smallest particles
and eliminating toxic gases and pathogenic germs, and also
allows to appropriately ionize the air.Within the scope of this aim, a further object of the
present invention is to provide an air depollution device
which is simple in concept, safely reliable in operation  
and versatile in use.This aim and this object are both achieved, according
to the invention, by the present air depollution device
comprising: a container which has,
at opposite ends, an intake grille and an emission grille,
both of which are suitable to convey a large stream of air;
a mechanical filter and an activated-charcoal filter which
are mounted side by side on a frame which is removably
inserted inside said container along a plane transverse to
said container; a collection device which is arranged
downstream of said two filters
