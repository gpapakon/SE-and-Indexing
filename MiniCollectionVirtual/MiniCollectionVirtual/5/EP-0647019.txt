<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a circuit for limiting the maximum 
current to be supplied to a load (Z) through a power Mos 

(Mp), being in particular of the regulated type using an 
equalizing capacitor (C). The addition of circuit means (2) 

with a one-way current flow between a terminal of said 
equalizing capacitor (C) and the gate terminal of (Mp) is 

effective to lower the voltage across the capacitor (C) and 
to speed up its charging process, thereby making the 

current limiting action expected from the circuit a timely 
one. The circuit means (2) may include a second Mos (M) of 

the same type as the power Mos (Mp). In this way, any 
deviations of (Mp) from its designed operation, as due to 

its manufacturing process and thermal drift phenomena, can 
be also compensated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a circuit for limiting the
maximum current to be supplied to a load from a power Mos,
in particular of a type which is regulated by means of an
equalizing capacitor.Specifically, the invention concerns a circuit for limiting
the maximum current to be supplied to a load from a power
Mos, where said load is connected to a terminal of an
external voltage supply and to the drain terminal of said
power Mos, being of a type which comprises:
a current generator connected to the gate terminal of the
power Mos, a resistance connected to the source terminal of the
power Mos and to the ground terminal, an amplifier which consists of,
an input stage comprising a pair of transistors whose
collectors are connected to the output terminals of a
current mirror circuit, and whose bases are connected to
each other through a series of two resistances having the
same value, the emitter of the first transistor being
connected to the ground terminal, the emitter of the second
transistor being connected to the source terminal of the
power Mos, and the terminal shared in common by said
resistances of equal value being connected to a terminal of
a voltage reference,an output stage comprising a bipolar transistor of
the pnp type having its emitter connected to the gate
terminal of said power Mos, collector connected to ground,
and base connected to the collector of the first of said
pair of input stage transistors,andan equalizing capacitance connected between the collector
and the base of the first of said input stage transistors
of said amplifier.There are several ways of limiting the current rating to a
load through an output terminal of a power Mos. The most
widely used one in the art sees recourse to a feedback
network which comprises an amplifier having one input
connected to a reference voltage, the other input connected
to a resistor which senses the current being flowed through
the load, and the output connected to the gate terminal of
the power Mos, see for example WO 89/01255.That amplifier basically performs a comparison between the
reference voltage and that applied to the other of its
inputs which increases with the current across the load. As
these two voltages tend to equal each other, the amplifier
operates by its output to limit the voltage at the gate of
the power Mos, thereby also limiting the current at the
output terminal connected to the load.A major problem to be addressed in such negatively feed back
arrangements is that of stability, especially where the
connected load is of the
