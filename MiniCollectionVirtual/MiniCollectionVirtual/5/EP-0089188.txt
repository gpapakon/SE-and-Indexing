<ABSTRACT>
A washing machine for a waste container or for any 
other container of a relatively large size is designed so as to 

be attached preferably to a vehicle, such as a lorry, for 
example as a unit with a frame of an exchangeable platform. 

The washing machine (1) comprises at least one rotable 
brush (2), which consists of a tubular brush body (3), from 

which the brush fibres project preferably radially, and of 
nozzle means for spraying the washing liquid onto the object 

to be washed. According to the invention, for the purpose of 
moving the brush (2) along a path of movement substantially 

of a shape of a rectangle or square in the normal plane of the 
axis (4) of rotation of the brush, the washing machine (1) 

comprises guide means (5, 6) and a drive gear (7) for moving 
the brush (2) in the normal plane of its axis (4) in one 

direction back and forth. The washing machine (1) addiÂ­
tionally comprises a second sit of guide means (8, 9) and a 

drive gear (10) for moving the brush (2) in the normal plane 
of its axis (4) back and forth in a direction perpendicular to 

the direction mentioned above.
