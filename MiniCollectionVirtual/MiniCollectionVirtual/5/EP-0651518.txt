<ABSTRACT>
A method of cascading sigma-delta modulators includes the step of 
feeding the input to the quantizer of each modulator stage to the subsequent 

stage. Therefore, the signal which is fed to each of the subsequent stages is 
the difference between the output and the quantization noise of the previous 

stage. The method also includes the step of removing the quantization noise 
of the first two stages, as well as the output of the first two stages, so that the 

final output of the cascaded modulators is a delayed version of the input, plus 
a scaled version of the last stage which has been shaped with a fourth-order 

high pass function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject matter of this application is related to that in our copending
application EP-A-0641085.The present invention relates generally to sigma-delta modulators. More
particularly, the present invention relates to methods of cascading sigma-delta
modulators. Oversampled interpolative (or sigma-delta) modulators comprise at
least one integration stage or filter followed by a quantization stage (most
typically a comparator) and a feedback from the output of the quantization
stage to the input of the integration stage. Depending upon the number of
integration stages, sigma-delta modulators can be divided into order types, e.g.,
second-order, third-order, or fourth-order.Sigma-delta modulators have come to be commonly used to perform
analog-to-digital (A/D) and digital-to-analog (D/A) conversion in a number of
applications. These applications include coder-decoders (codecs), integrated
services digital network (ISDN) equipment, and audio equipment.The use of higher order sigma-delta modulators has become desirable
in many applications for several reasons. One reason is because the
introduction of higher order modulators increases the number of integrations
to be carried out, which results in a decrease in the noise level of the passband
as the quantization noise is shifted to a higher frequency level. Another
reason is because the use of higher order modulators keeps the oversampling
ratio (i.e., the ratio of the modulator clock to the Nyquist rate) low, which
is desirable under certain conditions.A number of efforts have heretofore been undertaken to develop
higher order sigma-delta modulators. Five such efforts, those undertaken by
Matsuya et al., Ribner, Chao et al., Karema et al., and the inventor of the
present invention, Cabler, are discussed immediately below. Matsuya, et al., in "A 16-Bit Oversampling A-D Conversion Technology
Using Triple-Integration Noise Shaping", IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits,
Vol. SC-22, No. 6, pp. 921-929, Dec. 1987, have presented a method of
cascading three or more first-order modulators in order to provide higher
order noise shaping. A block diagram of this circuit is shown in FIG. 1 in our
aforesaid application EP-A-0641085. The technique employed in this
circuit, well known to those skilled in the art as the "MASH" technique, is
described at length in U.S. Patent 5,061,928 to Karema.
Although the circuit in FIG. 1
of EP-A-0641085 could be discussed at length, given the level of skill
of those skilled in the art, it suffices here to say that the circuit of that
