<ABSTRACT>
Safety device for heating elements in home appliances with a 
fluid subjected to temperature control comprises a thermostat 

(9) provided with a heat-sensitive element (10, 29, 32) 
immersed in the fluid, that is thermally and mechanically 

coupled to said heating elements (1, 18, 31) by 
thermally-conducting means (11, 23, 33), so as to provide, by 

means of said thermostat (9), a combined control of the 
temperature of the fluid and of that of the heating elements 

(1, 18, 31).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a safety device for heating
elements in temperature-controlled home appliances, such as
washing machines, washer-driers, dishwashers, deep-friers and
such like.Compliance with safety regulations in force in the matter of
home appliances obliges manufacturers to install suitable
safety devices on such home appliances that prevent the heating
elements from overheating, generally constituted by armoured
resistances immersed in a liquid or other suitable fluid.Such overheating can be caused by the lack of the fluid to
be heated, typically water in the case of washing machines, air
flow in the case of washer-driers and cooking oil in the case
of deep-friers. In the case, say, of a washing machine, the
absence of water inside the cylinder causes a fast increase in
the temperature of the heating resistance, and the possible
burning of its insulator coating; this is clearly dangerous, as
it involves the formation of an electrical short-circuit when
the water inside the cylinder shall once again come into
contact with the resistance.Safety devices are known that are constituted by power
supply switches triggered by devices sensitive to the external
temperature of the heating resistance.Such devices, however, are dedicated solely to a function of
surveillance of the temperature of the heating element,
separate devices being always provided to control the
temperature of the fluid to be heated; the latter are 
constituted by thermostats endowed with heat-sensitive elements
immersed in the fluid itself. This is naturally reflected on
costs of production.WO-A-92/056 75 discloses a safety device as set forth in the
preamble of claim 1. The safety device is however affected by scarce precision
in the control of the temperature of the fluid, because
the temperature of the latter is sensed by a thermally-responsive control
means outside the liquid chamber through a heat conduction link.In view of the state of the art, the object of the present
invention is to provide a safety device that integrates the
function of controlling the temperature of the fluid.According to the present invention such object is attained
thanks to a safety device for heating elements in home
appliances as set forth in claim 1.According to a preferred embodiment of the present
invention, said heat-sensitive element is fastened mechanically
to a flange wherein said heating elements are fastened to the
chassis of the home appliance.Thanks to the present invention it is possible to provide a
safety device integrating
