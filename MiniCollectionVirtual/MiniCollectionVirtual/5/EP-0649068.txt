<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus is provided for registration of color images on a 
photoreceptor belt (14). Registration is accomplished by forming, in one embodiment, 

chevron-shaped registration marks (10,12) in non-image areas of the belt (14). A Raster 
Output Scanner (ROS) sweeps an output beam across the belt's surface. The beam is 

modulated in accordance with input video data to form successive color images. An 
unmodulated beam is also swept across the registration marks, each mark being successively 

swept by a plurality of beams. With each crossing of the legs of the chevron (10,12), two 
signals are generated by an associated sensor and stored in an averaging and extrapolation 

circuit. The multiple signals are compared and detection of the intersection is calculated by an 
extrapolation method. The averaging circuitry generates a registration signal which is used to 

enable an accurate start of page signal, to correct for skew and to adlust for errors and line-to-line 
spacing between lines i
n a color image frame (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a xerographic system, and, more particularly, to
a system which incorporates a photoreceptor belt having registration marks on the surface thereof
whose location must be precisely detected for image registration purposes.The following patents contain disclosure of techniques for sensing marks placed on the
photoreceptor belt for various purposes.U.S.-A-4,912,491 discloses an apparatus for forming superimposed images and
registration marks corresponding to the position of the images associated therewith. The
registration marks are formed apart from the imaging portion of the medium in a transparent area to
be illuminated from the opposite side of the belt. Detectors sense the position of the registration
marks as the marks pass between the illuminated areas. The sensing of the registration marks is
used in determining proper registration positioning, whereby the image forming devices may be
adjusted to achieve such registration.U.S.-A-5,175,570 discloses a color image forming apparatus which forms registration
marks 1a, 1b, either as holes formed in the belt or as marks formed on the belt surface. The marks
are then sensed and used to adjust the position of the latent image.U.S.-A-4,963,899 discloses a color copier which uses a single imaging station to form
successive color images during multiple passes of a photoreceptor belt. Registration marks are
formed on the belt and are sensed for purposes of color image registration.JP-A-63-199416 discloses a measuring method for positional displacement using a mark
consisting of two circles of different diameters, one circle inside the other. Four signals are
produced by each scan across the mark and after scanning a plurality of times the central
coordinates of the circles can be determined and their positional displacement determined.For these prior art, mark-detecting systems, the instantaneous position of the mark is
sensed. Exact determination of the center of the registration marks within the desired accuracy of
plus or minus 5-10 microns is difficult because of the "noise" factor. Noise is attributable to stray
light, variations in the registration mark and the distance between the photoreceptor belt and the
detector. Also, for those systems using a laser Raster Output Scanner (ROS) as the imager,
additional noise is created by asymmetry in beam shape, variation in the intensity of the laser
source, and wobble of the rotating polygon.One object of the present invention is to provide an improved method of
