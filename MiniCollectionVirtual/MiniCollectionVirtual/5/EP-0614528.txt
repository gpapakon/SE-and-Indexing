<DESCRIPTION>
The field of this invention is gel electrophoresis.With the huge expansion in biotechnology, gel
electrophoresis has become an indispensable tool. The
ability to separate nucleic acid fragments and proteins by
means of size, shape and charge has added numerous
opportunities to identify specific compounds, indicate
purity, and allow for isolation of a compound in
relatively pure form. By being able to change the
conditions under which one carries out the
electrophoresis, one can determine many characteristics of
the compounds in the sample.A variety of new techniques are predicated on the use
of gel electrophoresis in an efficient and convenient way.
Restriction fragment length polymorphisms is one
application where one can perform genetic diagnosis by
means of a genomic DNA sample. This technique may also be
used in forensic medicine to identify the source of
nucleic acids. Gel electrophoresis may also be used to
identify a compound, by separation of a complex mixture
and then by using markers such as antibodies, or the like.
Electrophoresis is used in conjunction with transfer to a
membrane such as Southern, Northern, and Western blotting, 
or other techniques involving transfer of the separated
sample to a different substrate.While much of the power of gel electrophoresis as a
tool in identification and separation is realized, there
are still many shortcomings. Apparatuses tend to be
relatively large and cumbersome. Comparisons from samples
or runs and particularly from different laboratories are
very difficult since conditions of the electrophoresis
vary and regulation and monitoring of the conditions is
not available or unreliable. Thus, one frequently gets
wide variation in determinations of molecular weight, as
well as the properties of the sample components.
Therefore, it has been very difficult to make comparisons
from one run to another, no less from one laboratory to
another.Additionally, the gel electrophoretic apparatus
usually does not prevent the sample from running off the
gel, nor does it provide assurance that the sample has had
sufficient time for a reasonable separation. Thus,
substantial improvements in presently available equipment
is desirable in order to obtain a satisfactory
electrophoretic separation.There is substantial interest in being able to
provide electrophoretic systems which can be substantially
automated, assure directly comparative results, and
provide economies in the use of electrophoresis.References include J. Gershoni (1987) in Advances in

A gel electrophoresis sample
applicator/retriever device comprising:


a holder (5 or 105 or 209) comprising a single
elongate well (217) or a linear array of wells (8) or

mountings (111) for detachably mounting individual wells
(109), with the proviso that when said holder (105)

comprises said mountings (111), said device further
comprises a plurality of wells (109) capable of being

individually detachably mounted to said holder;
said well or wells each comprising a channel and
forming a nozzle (6 or 106 or 206) at a bottom end having

a front (33) and rear (35) face, said front and rear
faces being angled to form an edge (39) transverse to a

gel (29) surface in the direction of component migration
in said gel, and said front face having an aperture (27)

in communication with said channel, which aperture serves
to release sample components substantially uniformly into

a gel under the influence of an electrical field when
said nozzle is inserted into a gel; and
a retrieval electrode (25 or 125 or 225) for
inserting into said channel.
A device according to claim 1 wherein the
holder (5 or 105 or 209) comprises a linear array of

wells (8).
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2
wherein said front face (33) is at an angle of from about

53 to 58 degrees and said back face (35) at an angle of
from about 62 to 67 degrees to a gel surface when said

device is held upright.
A device according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein said retrieval electrode (25 or 125 or

225) is capable of removable insertion into said channel. 
A device according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein said wells (109) are detachably mounted on

said holder (5 or 105 or 209).
A device according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein said aperture (27) extends substantially

across said front face (33).
A device (305) according to any one of the
preceding claims further comprising a concentrator funnel

(310) capable of mounting on said channel and partially
extending into said channel.
A device according to any one of the preceding
claims comprising pegs (13) at each end of said holder (5

or 105 or 209) for mounting said holder on a support.
A device according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein said holder (5 or 105 or 209) is of clear

plastic.
A device according to any one of the preceding
claims wherein said holder (5 or 105 or 209)further

comprises an electrode extending into a well.
Use of a device according to any one of claims
1 to 10 in a method for performing a gel electrophoresis

with removal of at least one band during the course of
the electrophoresis prior to completion of said

electrophoresis, said method comprising:

inserting said nozzle (6 or 106 or 206) into said
gel while maintaining an electrical field in said gel,

whereby components in said sample migrate into said gel;
maintaining an electrical field in said gel, whereby
said components migrate and separate in said gel to

define bands;
inserting said nozzle (6 or 106 or 206)containing an 
electrically conducting medium into said gel adjacent at

least one parallel band and applying an electrical field
between said electrode (25 or 125 or 225) inserted in

said channel and a second electrode opposite said band
from said nozzle, whereby said component in said band

migrates into said
medium; and
removing said nozzle (6 or 106 or 206) from said
gel.
The method of claim 11 wherein said nozzle is
inserted through the surface of the gel to a depth not

greater than 75% and not less than 25% of the thickness
of the gel.
