<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to installation of floor
coverings and, more particularly, to a tool for raising and
lifting furniture, partitions or like during the
installation of the flooring.During the installation of carpet, ceramic tile or the
like in existing buildings where furniture, especially
modular partitions, needs to be moved, the installer is
faced with a recurring furniture moving dilemma. The
installer may either move the furniture, partitions or the
like by hand to one side of the room, install the carpet on
that side of the room and move the furniture back onto the
new flooring, install the remainder of the flooring and
reposition the furniture. Another way is to raise the
furniture, partitions or the like at its original position
so that flooring may be positioned underneath the
furniture, partition or the like.A useful device for raising and lowering furniture,
partitions or the like is illustrated in my U.S. Patent No.
4,846,443, the specification and drawings of which are
herein expressly incorporated by reference. This patent
illustrates a lifting device for raising and lowering
furniture, partitions or the like. While this invention
provides the art with a satisfactory device for raising and
lowering furniture, partitions or the like, designers
continue to strive to improve the art.Also, the following U.S. patents illustrate various
types of lifting devices. The patents are: 66,170;
829,344 ; 2,469,670; 2,536,550; 2,786,649; 2,786,650;
2,910,270; 3,081,066; 3,426,752; 3,662,994; 4,194,726.The present invention provides the art with an
improved floor covering installation tool which lifts
partitions, furniture or the like. The present invention
enables installers to position flooring underneath
furniture, partitions or the like without necessitating
removal of the furniture from its original position within
the room receiving the floor covering. The present invention also provides a removable
abutment member which enables the device to lift partitions
or the like with a single planar surface or with two or
more planar surfaces, such as a corner of a partition. The
invention is also provided with movable lifting brackets to
enable multi-positioning of the brackets with respect to
the object to be lifted and also to move from one abutment
member to the next. The present invention also includes a
live current indicator to test for live current in the
object to be lifted.From the subsequent description and the appended
claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings,
