<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the present invention is to be provide a device for the synchronous actuation of sliding door elements (1, 2, 3), which device is composed of a small number of parts, is robust and operates reliably and can be easily fitted, with a low space requirement. This is achieved by a scissors-type linkage (11, 12) which is arranged parallel to the surface of the sliding door elements (1, 2, 3) and has a common pivot point (10) fastened on the central sliding door element (2), the ends of the scissors-type linkage (11, 12) being connected to the two outer sliding door elements (1, 3). Actuation of an outer sliding door element (1 or 3) thus always inevitably results in a synchronous actuation of the sliding elements which are not directly exposed to the external force.
