<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum cleaner hose has a suction hose (4) and a grip piece (5, 6), fixed to one end thereof, with catch lugs (9) for releasable engagement with a counter-notch (8) on a vacuum cleaner housing (1). In order to achieve a structure here which is simple to produce, the catch lug (9) is integrally joined to one part of the grip piece and this grip piece part (5 and 6, respectively) is pivotably and integrally joined to the other grip piece and also to the purchase (5b, 6b).

Vacuum cleaner hose with a flexible suction hose (4) having a grip
member (5, 6) fixed thereto at one end, with which grip member a pivotable

locating lug (9) is associated, which is formed for detachable engagement
with a counter-catch (3) on a vacuum cleaner housing (1) and which is

provided with a manually actuatable handle (5b, 6b), characterised in that
the locating lug (9) is integral with part of the grip member (5, 6) and this

grip member portion (5 and 6 respectively) is connected with pivotal motion
and integrally with the rest of the grip member (5, 6, 7, 10) and with the

handle (5b, 6b).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1, characterised in that the grip
member (5, 6) has on an inner tube (7), on whose one end the suction

hose (4) is fixed, a radially outwardly extending hinge web (10), which a
pincer shank acting as a moving grip member portion (5 and 6

respectively) abuts, the pincer shank extending axially on either side away
from the hinge web (10) and carrying on the shank portion (5a, 6a) remote

from the suction hose (4) the locating lug (9), whilst the shank part (6a, 6b)
oriented towards the suction hose (4) is disposed as a handle with radial

clearance from the inner tube (7) or the suction hose (4).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that two
diametrically opposite pincer shanks (5, 6) are disposed on the inner tube

(7).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that the pincer shank (5, 6) is formed as a shell

disposed coaxial to the inner tube (7) and enclosing less than half the
circumference. 
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that the hinge web (10) has a web section (13)

standing on the outer surface of the inner tube (7) and a web section (15)
which abuts the former, is oriented parallel to the inner tube axis (14) and

to the suction hose (4), and which runs parallel to and with radial
clearance from the shank part (5a) provided with the locating lug (9).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, charac
terised in that the inner tube (7) projects axially beyond the
pincer shank (5a, 6a) provided with the locating hook (9).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1, characterised in that the hinge
web (10) has in the region of a pincer shank and in the axial region of the

locating lug (9) at least one adapted aperture.
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that between the pincer shanks (5, 6) gaps (11)

are provided in the axial direction.
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 8, characterised in that the gap
(11b) between the shank parts formed as a handle (5b, 6b) is wider than

between the shank parts (5a, 6a) carrying the locating lugs (9).
Vacuum cleaner hose according to claim 1 or one of the subsequent
claims, characterised in that at least one restoring spring element is

allocated to the grip member portions (5, 6).
