<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is to provide a 
device to make flow uniform in a denitrification system, 

which can achieve a predetermined flow regulation effect with 
low pressure loss independently of the gas flow rate. 

According to the present invention, the device installed on 
the upstream side of a chemical injection means for the 

denitrification system is composed of at least one perforated 
plate 11, and the perforated plate 11 can be turned by a 

rotating shaft 10 or 10a from the closed position where the 
gas flow path is closed to the open position where th
e gas 
flow path is opened or vice versa.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device to make gas flow
uniform used in an exhaust gas denitrification system.The conventional boiler is provided with a
denitrification system to remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) in
exhaust gas. In this denitrification system, an NOx removal
catalyst is contained. An ammonia injection nozzle for
injecting ammonia (NH3) is provided on the upstream side of
the denitrification system, and a device to make gas flow uniform
for regulating the flow of exhaust gas is provided on the
upstream side of the ammonia injection nozzle.The aforementioned device to make gas flow uniform,
consisting of a number of steel members etc. having a
chevron-shaped cross section which are fixedly arranged in
parallel or in a lattice shape in the exhaust gas flow path,
achieves flow uniform effect only for a predetermined gas
flow property.In the aforementioned device to make gas flow uniform,
because the flow uniform lattice etc. is fixed, the shape of
the lattice is such that the boiler is adapted to the exhaust
gas flow rate at base load (high load). Therefore, the flow 
uniform effect cannot be achieved sufficiently for a low
exhaust gas flow rate at partial loads. If the device to
make gas flow uniform is constructed so as to achieve the flow
regulation effect at partial loads, the pressure loss becomes
excessive at high loads.An object of the present invention is to provide a
device to make gas flow uniform in a denitrification system which
can solve the above problems.In accordance with the present invention, the device to make gas flow uniform installed on the upstream
side of a chemical injection means in a denitrification system,
is characterized in that said device comprises at least one
perforated plate arranged across the gas flow, and in that said perforated plate
can be turned from the closed position where the gas flow path is closed to the
open position where the gas flow path is opened or vice versa.According to the present invention, when the load is
low and in turn the gas flow rate is low, the perforated
plate arranged across the gas flow is turned to close the gas
flow path. Therefore, the gas flows through the holes in the
perforated plate, so that a predetermined flow uniform is
achieved. On the other hand, when the load is high, the
perforated plate is turned to open the flow path, which 
maintains the predetermined flow regulation effect and
prevents the increase in pressure loss.FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of the
present invention;FIG. 2 is a sectional
