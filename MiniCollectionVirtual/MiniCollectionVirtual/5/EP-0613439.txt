<ABSTRACT>
A locking and release mechanism for securing a loading/unloading buoy (2) on a vessel (1), wherein the buoy (2) is of the type to be introduced into a submerged downwardly open receiving space (3) in the vessel (1), and to be fastened in a releasable manner in the receiving space. The mechanism comprises hydraulically actuated locking elements (40) mounted about horizontal axes (41) at the sides of the receiving space (3), to pivot between the locking and releasing positions, the buoy (2) having a peripheral collar (20) having a downwards facing abutment edge (21) for engagement with the locking elements (40) in the locking position thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a locking and release mechanism 
for securing a loading/unloading buoy on a vessel, wherein 
the buoy is of the type to be introduced into a submerged 
downwardly open receiving space in the vessel, and to be fastened 
in a releasable manner in the receiving space. There are previously known various types of submerged 
buoy structures wherein locking and release mechanisms of the 
above-mentioned type are used. For example, from US patent 
specification No. 4 604 961 (corresponds to Norwegian patent 
specification No. 167 906) there is known a vessel having a 
releasable mooring system wherein the vessel has a through-going 
deck opening, the lower part of the through opening forming a 
submerged receiving space for a mooring element in the form of 
a submerged buoy. In the receiving space there is arranged a 
rotating body (turret) which is rotatably mounted in the hull of 
the vessel and is designed for receipt and releasable attachment 
of the buoy. To this end, the buoy is provided with a hydraulically 
actuated locking mechanism for attachment to the rotating 
body. Since the hydraulically actuated locking mechanism in 
the known system is arranged on the mooring element or buoy, this 
requires divers for connection of the control hydraulics. 
Alternatively, a relatively complicated swivel means must be 
used. Diver operations in connection with connection and 
disconnection are time consuming and renders the use of the known 
system as a transport system impossible, when using shuttle 
tankers. Further, there is a big risk for faulty operations and 
damages in case of uncontrolled disconnection. Further, a very 
substantial disadvantage is that, in case of breakage in the 
hydraulic system, there is no possibility for connection of a 
back-up or auxiliary device. In the known locking mechanism, there are used horizontally 
movable locking pins which are moved in their longitudinal 
direction for engagement with an abutment surface on the rotating 
body. This is an unadvantageous solution, since it results in 
great edge loads on the locking pins and the abutment surface 
during disconnection, especially in case of unrelieved emergency  
 
disconnection, and thereby to deforming stresses. It is thus a general object of the invention to provide 
a locking and release mechanism which is without the above-mentioned 
drawbacks. A more particular object of the invention is to provide 
a locking and release mechanism which avoids large edge loads 
under connection as well as

<CLAIMS>
A releasable locking mechanism for securing a 
loading/unloading buoy to a floating vessel in a downwardly 

open receiving space thereof, the mechanism comprising a plurality 
of locking elements (40; 50; 60; 70) arranged 

around a receiving opening for receiving a portion of a buoy, 
and 

mounted 
for pivoting by drive means about horizontal axes (41; 51; 

61; 71) between a locking 
and a release position, the locking elements having 

engagement portions for engagement in use with a downwardly facing 
abutment edge (21) of a buoy (2) in the locking position 

thereof, the locking elements after release thereof being 
free to move in a manner such that the engagement portions 

move downwardly and away from the receiving opening, 
characterised in that the locking elements (50; 60; 70) are 

arranged to be pivoted by respective locking arms (58-61; 
62, 63; 72) which provide mechanical self-locking of the 

locking elements (50; 60; 70) in the locked position in 
case of failure of the drive means. 
A mechanism according to claim 1 wherein the locking 
elements (40; 50; 60; 70) comprise a pair of dogs mounted 

at diametrically opposite sides of the receiving space (3). 
A mechanism according to claim 1 or 2 wherein the 
drive  

 
means comprise hydraulic actuators (52; 65; 74) located externally 

of the receiving space (3). 
A mechanism according to claim 3 wherein the hydraulic 
actuators are connected to a hydraulic drive system in parallel. 
A mechanism according to any preceding claim having a 
backup means (77) for the release of the locking elements (70) in 

case of failure of the drive means. 
A mechanism according to claim 5 wherein the drive means 
comprises hydraulic means and the backup means comprises a 

hydraulic accumulator.
