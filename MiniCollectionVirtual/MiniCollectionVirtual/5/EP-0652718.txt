<ABSTRACT>
Described is a shoe (1) with a central rotary fastener (7) attached to an insole cover (4), a tensioning element (8) being formed by two loop straps (9, 10) on each side of the insole cover (4). The rear strap (9) is linked to a rear tensioning belt (13) which runs rearwards and downwards at an angle from one loop strap (9) to the outside (15) of the heel. The front strap (10) is linked to a tensioning belt (16) which is separate from the rear tensioning belt (13) and which runs rearwards and downwards at an angle from the other loop strap (10), extending towards the arch of the foot on the inside (17) and towards the ball (20) of the foot on the outside (18).

Footwear (1) especially footwear for sport or leisure, with a central

   rotary closure (7) which is provided on an instep-shield (4) and in
which a tightener element (8) actuable by the central rotary closure (7)

is led out in the form of two loops (9, 10) to each side and over a deflector
element (11) on a coupling member (12) in the region of the side

portions of the upper (6), so by turning the central rotary closure (7)
the loops (9, 10) my be shortened for closing the footwear (1) and lengthened

for opening it, and both on the inside (17) and outside (18) of
the footwear a rear tension-strap (13) runs back down in the direction of

pull at an angle to the inside or outside of the heel (15) whilst a front
tension strap (16) runs back down at an angle on the inside (17) of the

footwear in the direction of the arch of the foot and on the outside (18)
of the footwear in the direction of the outer ball (20) of the middle of

the foot, characterized in that

the deflector elements (11) present in the region of the inside (17)
and outside (18) of the footwear are provided on quite separate tension-straps

(13, 16), the said tension-straps (13, 16) being connected firmly
to the footwear (1), the upper (6) or the sole (23) merely in the end

region (22) of their lower limit.
Footwear as in Claim 1, characterized in that

   from the free end provided with the deflector element (12) the
tension-straps (13, 16) increase in width (21) from an initial minimum

corresponding with the width of the deflector element (11) up to about 2
to 9 cm, especially to about 5 to 7 cm at the end region fastened to the

footwear (1), the upper (6) or the sole (23).
Footwear as in Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that

   except for the region (24) of the deflector elements (11) and if
necessary except for an adjoining section (25) of 1 to 3 cm the tension-straps

(13, 16) are connected firmly to the footwear (1), the upper (6)
or the sole (23).
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that

   the tension-straps (13, 16) consist of material elastic in bending
but of low extensibility.
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that
 
for increasing their bendability the tension-straps (13, 16) exhibit weak

points (26) where the material has been thinned, and/or openings (27).
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that

   the tightener element (8) may be inserted from the rear into the
coupling member (12) and laid over the deflector element (11).
Footwear as in one of the Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that

   slide-tabs (28, 29) are provided, running in the direction of the
tension-straps (13, 16), against which rests the associated coupling

member (12) in the region of the usual open positions until the fully
closed position.
