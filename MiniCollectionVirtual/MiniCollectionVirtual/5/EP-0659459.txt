<ABSTRACT>
A filter apparatus includes a generally box-shaped 
casing (40) formed by connecting peripheral edges of first 

and second casing members (10, 20) each having a concavity 
and filter (30) assuming the shape of a bag when disposed in 

the casing (40). The casing (40) has a suction port (12) 
and an exhaust port (23a) each communicating between the 

interior and the exterior of the casing (40). The filter 
(30) has an opening (31d) connected to either the suction 

port (12) or the exhaust port (23a). The filter (30) is 
com
posed of first and second filter media (31, 32) placed 
one upon the other and having respective peripheries held 

between substantially the entire peripheral edges of the 
first and second casing members (10, 20). The first and 

second filter media (31, 32) have respective through holes 
(31b, 32b) and are closely adhered together at peripheral 

portions of the respective through holes (31b, 32b).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filter of the type having a
casing composed of two casing members.FIGS. 11 to 14 illustrate a conventional filter
apparatus of the above-described type. The filter apparatus
is shown upside down for convenience' sake.A casing 1 of the shown filter apparatus comprises
first and second casing members 2 and 3 each of which has a
concavity, as shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. The first casing
member 2 has a suction port 4 and the second casing member 3
has an exhaust port 5. A filter 6 is formed by folding a
sheet of filter medium back and has an opening 7 formed so
as to correspond to the suction port 4 of the first casing
member 2, as shown in FIG. 13.The first and second casing members 2, 3 are placed so
that the concavities thereof face each other with the filter
6 being enclosed. A peripheral edge of the first casing
member 2 is put into a peripheral curled portion of the
second casing member 3, being held in position so that seal
is provided. In this state, the peripheral edge of the
filter 6 is held between the peripheral edges of the first
and second casing members 2, 3 except its folded portion.
Since portions of the peripheral edges of the casing members
2, 3 holding the peripheral edge of the filter 6 are
continuous with those not holding it as shown in FIG. 14,
the second casing member 3 is previously formed with a 
stepped portion 8 so that the folded portion of the filter 6
can be positioned.The folded portion of the filter 6 thus need to be
positioned with respect to the stepped portion 8 in the
above-described filter apparatus. This positioning
complicates the control in assembling steps of the filter
apparatus. Furthermore, when the casing 1 is formed of a
metal, the sealing performance is reduced at the portions of
the peripheral edges of the casing members 2, 3 not holding
the peripheral edge of the filter 6 therebetween.
Additionally, since the filter medium is folded back.
through holes formed in the filter 6 to communicate between
the interiors of the casing members 2, 3 cannot be located
at an optimum position.GB-A-2 102 690 shows a filter apparatus in which
the filter medium is foldet back, too, so that the above described
problems are also present.Therefore, an object of the present invention is to
provide an improved filter apparatus where in the sealing
performance can be improved and the assembling steps can be
simplified.To achieve the object, the present invention provides a
filter apparatus comprising a generally box-shaped casing
formed by connecting
