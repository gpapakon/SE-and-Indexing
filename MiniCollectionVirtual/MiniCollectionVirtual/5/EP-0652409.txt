<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus suitable for controlling the temperature of perishable 
products during transportation thereof comprising the combination of a 

smaller than usual mechanical refrigeration system 14 and a cryogenic 
system 16 together with a control system for operating one or the other or 

both systems so as to maintain the temperature within the container within 
a predetermined temperature range.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigeration apparatus and relates 
particularly, but not exclusively, to a transportable refrigeration 
apparatus. Transportable refrigeration apparatus are generally used for maintaining 
the temperature of a perishable product within acceptable limits during 
transportation thereby to avoid spoilage and ensure the product reaches the 
customer in the best possible condition. Presently known transportable refrigeration apparatus generally comprise 
cryogenic or mechanical refrigeration systems for supplying a cooling 
atmosphere to the interior of a container in which the perishable product 
is stored. In a cryogenic system, cryogenic fluid, such as for example 
liquid nitrogen, is sprayed over the perishable such that the liquid and/or 
vaporised nitrogen acts to cool the product. Mechanical systems work on 
the principle of heat exchange between the interior and exterior of the 
container. Liquid held in a closed loop refrigeration system is compressed 
by a mechanical compressor and then expanded within an evaporator 
positioned within the container to be cooled. Expansion of the liquid 
causes a temperature drop thereof and thus cold liquid is passed through 
the evaporator in which a heat exchange operation takes place such that the 
liquid refrigerant is heated and the atmosphere within the container is 
cooled. The heated liquid is cooled by passing it through a heat exchanger 
positioned outside of the container and exposed to the passage of cooling 
air. The above mentioned refrigeration apparatus do suffer from a number of 
drawbacks which can result in them being unable to meet the requirements of 
some operators. Mechanical systems, for example, generally use a diesel 
compressor which when operated in confined spaces, such as loading bays, 
cause unacceptable noise and pollution. In addition to this, they provide 
a comparatively slow means of reducing the temperature within the container 
taking some three times longer than an equivalent cryogenic system. This 
can cause problems during loading, when it will be necessary to operate the 
mechanical system for a comparatively long period of time before loading  
 
can take place. Slow temperature recovery after the container has been 
opened is also a problem associated with such mechanical systems. 
Breakdowns are not unknown and this could result in the spoiling of a 
valuable cargo. Cryogenic refrigeration systems, whilst being silent in operation, 
reliable and being able to provide a rapid reduction

<CLAIMS>
A refrigeration apparatus comprising a container (10) for receiving 
items to be maintained under controlled temperature conditions and a 

temperature control means for generating and controlling said 
controlled temperature within the container, characterised in that the 

temperature control means comprises the combination of a mechanical 
refrigeration device (12) and a cryogenic refrigeration device (14) 

together with a control system (43) for controlling the operation of 
each device so as to cause the operation of one or other or both of 

said devices (12, 14) in accordance with predetermined operating 
parameters. 
A refrigeration apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised by 
circulation means (42) for causing the circulation of a mechanical 

and/or cryogenically refrigerated atmosphere within the container (10). 
A refrigeration apparatus as claimed in either of the preceding claims 
characterised by supply control means (43) for controlling the supply 

of product of the cryogenic and/or mechanical refrigeration devices to 
different zones (10a, 10b, 10c) within the container (10) thereby to 

create zones of different temperature therein. 
A refrigeration apparatus as claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that said container (10) comprises a road haulable 

container. 
A method of operating a refrigeration apparatus as claimed in any one 
of claims 1 to 4 characterised by the following steps : 


(a) operating the cryogenic refrigeration device so as to reduce 
rapidly the temperature within the container to or within a given 

range of a first temperature below that of atmospheric and at 
which it is desired to maintain a product to be placed in the 

container. 
(b) operating the mechanical refrigeration device to maintain the 
temperature within the container at or within a given range of 

said first temperature; 
(c) operating the cryogenic refrigeration device to initiate a rapid 
reduction in temperature within the container after the escape of 

atmosphere therefrom. 
(d) repeating steps (b) and (c) as required so as to maintain the 
temperature within the container within a desired temperature 

range. 
A method as claimed in claim 5 including the further step of operating 
the mechanical refrigeration 
device during step (c) so as to assist in 
the reduction of temperature within the container. 
A method as claimed in claim 5 including the further step of ceasing 
operation of the cryogenic refrigeration device during step (c) and 

operating the mechanical refrigeration device once the temperature 
within the container is within a given range of said first temperature. 
A method as claimed in any one of the claims 5 to 7 including the step 
of ceasing the operation of the cryogenic refrigeration device before 

or within a first pre-set time period after commencement of operation 
of the mechanical refrigeration device in step (b). 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 5 to 8 including the step of 
ceasing the operation of the mechanical refrigeration device under step 

(b) before or within a second pre-set time period after commencement of 
operation of the cryogenic refrigeration device under step (c). 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 5 to 9 including the step of 
controlling the flow of product from the cryogenic and/or mechanical 

refrigeration devices to different zones within the container, thereby 
to create zones of different temperatures.
