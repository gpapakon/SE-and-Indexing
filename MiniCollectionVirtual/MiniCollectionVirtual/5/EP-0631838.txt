<ABSTRACT>
In a method for effecting precision laser machining to a work by a laser machining head through additional 
operation shaft means (8) mounted to a robot body (1) of a multi-joint type laser robot, a required time (A+B) for 

taking the machining head by rapid feed from an origin point (OR) to a machining start point (E) according to 
various machining specifications stored in a rewritable storage means and a required time (C) for taking it similarly 

to the starting point without using rapid feed are calculated and compared with each other by arithmetic means (CPU) 
provided to a robot controller (10) of the laser robot. Only when the required time (A+B) is shorter than the required 

time (C), a rapid feed command is given automatically to driving motors (MA, MB) of the additional operation shaft 
means (8) so that the rapid feed operation of the laser machining head becomes effective to a predetermined laser 

machining trajectory. In this way, judgement is made automatically and laser machining efficiency can be improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser machining method 
employing a multi-articulated laser-equipped robot having a 
plurality of axes of motion (an axis about which one of the 
movable elements of an industrial robot has a degree of 
freedom of motion is referred to as an axis of motion.), and a 
multi-articulated laser robot provided with a control apparatus 
for carrying out the method. More particularly, it relates to a 
laser-beam machining method that feeds a laser-beam 
projecting unit, attached to the extremity of a laser robot, by 
the controlling operation of an additional motion- axis 
mechanism, incorporating therein two feed motors, along a 
narrow machining locus of a small diameter to thereby 
efficiently machine a workpiece with a laser beam projected 
through a laser beam projecting nozzle on the laser beam 
projecting unit, and a multi-articulated laser robot suitable for 
carrying out the laser-beam machining method. A laser robot, particularly a well-known multi-articulated 
laser robot having freedom of motion about six axes, is 
provided with a robot wrist , i.e., one of the movable elements 
of the robot, attached to the extremity thereof. The robot is 
further provided with an additional-axis mechanism including 
two drive motors and moves a laser beam projecting unit along 
a predetermined path, i.e., a feed path, in a biaxial coordinate 
plane using the additional motion-axis mechanism. Such a laser 
robot capable of forming a precision small hole in a workpiece 
by feeding the laser beam projecting unit along a circular feed 
path having a small diameter has been proposed and put into 
practical use for laser-beam machining. A multi-articulated laser robot provided with the 
above-mentioned additional motion-axis mechanism has a robot 
unit as shown in Fig. 1, and the operation of the robot unit is  
 
controlled by a well-known robot controller for implementing 
the desired laser-beam machining. The robot unit 1 has a robot base 2, a robot body 3 set 
upright on the robot base 2, a turning robot body 4 turnably 
joined to the upper part of the robot body 3, a robot upper arm 5 
pivotally joined for rotating about a horizontal axis to one end 
of the turning robot body 4, a robot forearm 6 pivotally joined, 
for rotating about a horizontal axis relative to the robot upper 
arm 5, to the extremity of the robot upper arm 5, a robot wrist 
7 having three degrees of freedom of motion, joined to the 
extremity of the robot forearm 6 and capable of rotatinging 
about three axes
