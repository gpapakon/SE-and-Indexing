<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method and apparatus for testing a memory card 
(50'). The memory card (50') includes a plurality of storage 

locations which store data bits and ECC check bits. On the 
storage controller associated with the memory card (50') under 

test are provided means (420) for generating a test data pattern 
and input ECC logic (110) and output ECC logic (160). On reading 

the test data pattern into the storage locations ECC check bits 
are generated which are stored in the ECC bit array (140). On 

reading out the test data pattern, the ECC check bits are used 
to see whether any error has occurred in the data bits and, if 

so, this is signalled (ECC_SE; ECC_UCE). The method and 
apparatus further includes means (370) to step through all the 

addresses in the memory card (50') under test so that a complete 
test may be carried out at system speed. On completion of the 

test, the occurrence of any errors and their location within the 
memory card (50') may be read from provided registers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a memory card comprising data memory 
with a plurality of storage locations, data input lines 
connected to a data-in register, data output lines connected to 
an error detector and a storage controller for controlling the 
data memory including means for providing a clock signal. The invention further provides a method for testing a memory 
card with a data bit array, a check bit array and a keystore 
(SRAM) array. All electronic computers require memory in order to store 
programs and data. In mainframe computers and large 
workstations, these memories are located on plugable cards, 
known as memory cards, which also contain logic to control the 
memory operations. This logic is known as the storage controller 
logic. Memory cards which incorporate such logic are known as 
intelligent memory cards. All components incorporated on the intelligent memory card are 
tested before they are mounted on the card. Nevertheless after 
completion of the manufacturing process, the memory card has to 
extensively tested before it can be shipped to the customer. 
These tests are necessary to detect problems caused by component 
test escapes, tolerance problems, manufacturing problems and 
possible design problems. Such tests are usually carried out 
using expensive memory testers which, depending on the 
performance of the memory card to be tested, may cost up to $2 
million. This cost can be explained by the high operation speed  
 
and accuracy which has to be provided at the interface of the 
tester in order to stress the memory card under test. Current memory testers test memory cards by generating a data 
pattern for a location in the memory card under test, storing 
the data pattern into the location and then reading the data 
pattern out of the location. The stored data pattern is compared 
with the original data pattern to see whether it has been 
changed in any way in the memory card. If this is the case, then 
the presence of an error in the memory card is signalled. This 
test procedure is repeated for every memory location on the 
memory card. As a result of the repeated storing, reading and 
comparison of data patterns, the testing of a high density 
memory card is very time consuming. For instance testing a 64 MB 
memory card takes at least a few minutes on a Macrodata MD407 
manufacturing tester. Considering the growing capacity of modern 
memory cards (design work is currently proceeding on a 1 GB 
card), the time and cost required to test just one memory card 
will increase
