<ABSTRACT>
Methods for producing and using bispecific antibodies formed by leucine zippers are provided. Leucine zippers capable of preferentially forming heterodimers are respectively linked to epitope binding components comprising different binding specificities. Bispecific antibodies are formed by pairwise association of the leucine zippers, forming a heterodimer which links the two distinct epitope binding components. Heterodimerization can occur by interaction of the two leucine zipper regions, forming a bispecific antibody. Such a bispecific antibody may be further stabilized by the formation of intermolecular chemical bonds, such as disulfide bonds, between the two monomeric subunits. Subsequent to the formation of such intermolecular bonds between the monomeric subunits, the leucine zippers may be removed or retained. Bispecific antibodies produced by these methods are substantially pure and may be produced in high yields and on a large scale. Alternatively, bifunctional heterodimers may be formed by linking an epitope binding component to a macromolecular species that is not an epitope binding component.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY HETERODIMERSTECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to bispecific antibodies, epitope binding components capable of forming specific heterodimers with other epitope binding components, methods for producing such bispecific antibodies and epitope binding components, methods for using such bispecific antibodies and epitope binding components, and pharmaceutical compositions containing such bispecific antibodies and epitope binding components.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Bispecific antibodies are antibodies with dual epitope binding specificities, with one specificity being the capacity to bind a first epitope and a second specificity being the capacity to bind a second epitope.Such bispecific antibodies are, in some embodiments, potentially valuable molecules for immunotherapy. For example, bispecific antibodies can crosslink cytotoxic effector cells to target cells (Segal and Snider, (1989) Chem. Immunol. 47:179) , resulting in the killing of the target cell.Although numerous bispecific antibodies have been shown effective in vitro (Gililand et al., (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA £55:7719; Lanzavecchia and Scheidegger, (1987) Eur. J. Immunol. 1/7:105; Stearz and Bevan, (1986) Immunol. Today 2:241; Berg et al., (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88.:4732) , few have been tested clinically as therapeutic agents. One of the reasons for the slow development of bispecific antibodies as therapeutic agents has been the difficulty in manufacturing them in sufficient purity and quantity.Bispecific antibodies have been produced by chemical cross-linking, by hybrid-hybridomas (Milstein and Cuello, (1984) Immunol. Today 5_:299) or transfectomas, or by disulfide 

 exchange at the hinge of two different Fab' . The first method yields heterogeneous and ill-defined products. The second method requires extensive purification of the bispecific antibodies from many hybrid-antibody side products, the presence of which may interfere with the cell cross-linking activity. The disulfide exchange method applies essentially only to F(ab')2, and is thus limited by the susceptibility of the monoclonal antibodies to cleavage by enzyme digestion (Parham, (1983) J. Immunol. 131:2895). Further, since Fab' have little affinity for each other, very high protein concentrations are required for the formation of the inter-Fab' disulfide bonds. The disulfide exchange method has been improved by the use of Ellman's reagent to modify one of the Fab' prior to oxidation with the other Fab• , reducing the
