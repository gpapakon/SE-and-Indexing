<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an oven muffle (1) with at least one heating element (2) mounted in the muffle interior so as to be pivotable parallel to a muffle wall situated at a short distance therefrom. According to the invention, the pivoting axis of the heating element (2) is arranged outside the plane formed by the heating element (2). In particular, the heating element (2) is mounted on a pivot realised in the form of a knife-edge bearing. The pivoting mechanism is of structurally simple and largely wear-free design. The heating element can be relatively easily pivoted owing to the negligible friction.

Baking oven muffle (1) with at least one heating body (2) pivotably arranged in the
muffle interior parallel to a muffle wall spaced away slightly, wherein the heating body (2)

consists of multi-limbed heating body elements which are guided as several windings and
are able to be surrounded by a flange (23), wherein the pivot axis of the heating body (2) is

arranged outside the plane formed by the heating body (2) and is realised in the form of a
knife-edge bearing, characterised in that the flange (23) of the heating body (2) has an

edge forming the knife-edge (24) and that the knife-edge is mounted in a seat (11), which
is arranged at the rear wall of the baking oven muffle (1), of a built-in part (4).
Baking oven muffle according to claim 1, characterised in that a curved part (4),
which forms an abutment limitation (41) for the heating body (2), is arranged at the rear

wall of the baking oven muffle (1).
Baking oven muffle according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the
flange (23) engages in the curved part (4) and that the heating body (2) together with the

flange (23) adopts at least two defined positions (2.1, 2.2) in the curved part (4).
Baking oven muffle according to claim 3, characterised in that the flange (23) in a
first position (2.1) closes recesses provided in the rear wall of the baking oven muffle (1)

for the heating body (2).
Baking oven muffle according to one of claims 3 and 4, characterised in that the
flange (23) in a second position (2.2) closes recesses provided in the curved part (4) for

the heating body (2).
Baking oven muffle according to one of claims 4 and 5, characterised in that the
heating body (2) in its first position (2.1) is arranged parallel to the muffle ceiling and that

associated with the heating body (2) and/or the muffle ceiling is a fastening element (7.1,
7.2) holding the heating body (2) in a first position (2.1) and enabling the pivot movement.
Baking oven muffle according to claim 6, characterised in that the fastening
element (7.1, 7.2) consists of a fastening strap (7.1) and of a knurled screw (7.2). 
Baking oven muffle according to one of claims 6 and 7, characterised in that the
fastening element (7.1, 7.2) is arranged in the vicinity of the loading opening.
Baking oven muffle according to claim 8, characterised in that the fastening
element (7.1, 7.2) is arranged approximately centrally in the vicinity of the loading opening

and that associated with the heating body (2) are two spacers (8, 9) facing in the direction
of the muffle ceiling and each arranged at a respective side of the heating body.
