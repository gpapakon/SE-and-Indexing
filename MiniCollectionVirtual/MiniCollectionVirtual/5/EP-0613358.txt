<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
to automatically position and operate surgical
instruments, in particular for refractive keratic
surgery, in particular lamellar refractive surgery.More particularly, the invention relates to an
apparatus of the said type, that allows surgical
techniques to be carried out with an extreme safety and
a high repeatability.It is well-known that in all the fields of
surgery one tries to realize equipments that allow to
operate to a greater precision, and, moreover, allow
surgeons having not a very long experience to carry out
delicate operative surgeries.This is even more true in those fields wherein
it is operated upon delicate organs, and therefore is
particularly felt in ophthalmological surgery.In this field, a very important operation
consists in lamellar refractive surgery
(keratomyleusis).Keratomyleusis is a surgical methodology well
known to those skilled in the art, originally set by
Prof. Barraquer.It has developed during years through three
techniques, and the relevant apparatuses have been
realized by Barraquer himself, by Krumeich and Swinger
and then by Ruiz.Among the various equipments that make up the
set of the surgical instruments necessary to operate,
Barraquer's technique provides the use of a sucking
metal ring which is applied on the eye of the patient
and whereon the microkeratome slides. In order to be able to achieve the exact
keratic surface protrusion it is necessary to have a
complete set of sucking metal rings at disposal.Before carrying out the operation, one
measures the intraocular pressure caused by the ring and
measures, by means of a precalibrated lens, the
lenticule diameter that would be obtained with that
particular ring.Only after verifying these variables and
selecting the proper ring, one will be able to proceed
to the section of the lamella.Obviously, all these operations render the
operation more difficult, less safe and longer.In EP-A-0 208 950 it is disclosed an apparatus
to automatically position and operate surgical
instruments for performing corneal transplants
comprising:
means for correctly positioning the equipment
in correspondence with the operating table (2) (see
figure 1);means for vertically raising all the
apparatus (see page 13, second paragraph, first
sentence, reference 7);a horizontal guide (9) (see page 13, second
paragraph, second sentence);a first support formed by references (8) and
(11), arranged slidably on the guide (9) (see page 13,
second paragraph, second and third sentence);a horizontal
