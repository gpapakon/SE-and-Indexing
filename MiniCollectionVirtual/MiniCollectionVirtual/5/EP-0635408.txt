<ABSTRACT>
A unit (3) on board a vehicle comprising an immobilizer (10) of the vehicle's 
engine, a logical unit (4) and a transponder reader (12), and a transponder (13) 

carried by the vehicle owner, are associated among one another so that, when 
the vehicle's engine is switched off, the logical unit (4) automatically activates 

the immobilizer (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a safety system for vehicles, more especially, a 
system that can activate protection against theft of the vehicle after the same 
system has automatically and independently recognized the person authorized 
for use of the vehicle. In the description below and in the claims said person will simply be termed - 
the owner-. In the field of electronic safety devices for vehicles, more simply termed anti-theft 
device, the theft protection functions are realized by means of devices 
suited to preventing the vehicle engine start-up; these devices interrupt the flow 
of fuel to the engine, of electricity to the starter motor or to the car's original 
electronic units. According to the current state of the art the activation and dis-activation 
of said 
anti-theft devices take place by the voluntary action of the owner by means of a 
remote control. This remote control sends the anti-theft device an appropriately 
encoded message using the broadcasting of electro-magnetic waves, that is both 
radio waves and infrared waves, or else using the electric connection of an 
electronic key. The more evolved anti-theft devices on the market comprise the "alarm" part 
and the "motor-blocking" part and allow that the latter, henceforth termed - 
immobilizer -, may be automatically connected after a set period of time from 
when the vehicle's engine is switched off. The disadvantage of the present anti-theft devices is that their dis-activation 
must be controlled by the owner. The vehicle safety system according to the present invention, as characterized in 
the claims, comprises a conventional anti-theft device, a logical unit, a  
 
transponder reader on board the vehicle and a transponder carried by the user, 
all four are associated to one another, in order that the anti-theft device be 
automatically activated after a set period from the switching off of the engine 
and that it be dis-activated when the intention of starting the engine is made 
manifest, for example by turning the starter key, jointly to the fact that the 
reader identifies the presence of said transponder in a given region of space pre-established 
around the starter key lodging or around the driving seat. The meaning of "transponder" as intended herein is made clear below. It is an 
electronic device consisting of a transmitter and a receiver of electro-magnetic 
waves and by a memory containing a given message. When stimulated by a 
suitable electro-magnetic wave the transponder responds transmitting the 
message
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A safety system for vehicles fitted with a warning device (2) to signal any 
break-in efforts and an immobilizer (10) to perform the blockage of the engine 

characterized in that it comprises a unit (3) on board the vehicle bearing said 
immobilizer (10), a logical unit (4) and a transponder reader (12) and that 

comprises a transponder (13) held by the owner, all four (10, 4, 12, 13) 
associated among one another so that when the vehicle's engine is switched off 

said logical unit (4) automatically activates said immobilizer (10) and, in the 
case of engine start-up request, said reader (12) receives and identifies the 

message from said transponder (13) and, in case of correct identification said 
logical unit (4) releases said immobilizer (10). 
Safety system according to claim 1 characterized in that an antenna (21) 
that queries and reads said transponder (13) is fitted on block (20) of the starter 

key (23) or the immediate surroundings and said reader (12) is close to said 
block (20) so that the area read may have a range of a few centimetres. 
Safety system according to claims 1 and 2 characterized in that said 
transponder (13) is contained in the grip of the starter key (23). 
Safety system according to claims 1 and 2 characterized in that said 
transponder (13) is held in the case in which the key head and remote control 

for the alarm system to the vehicle are contained. 
Safety system according to claims 1 and 2 characterized in that said 
transponder (13) is in the form of a card kept in the driving licence of the 

owner. 
System according to claims from 1 to 5 characterized in that the signal 
(14) that controls said immobilizer (10) is a coded signal. 
safety system according to claims from 1 to 6 characterized in that said 
logical unit (4) reads said transponder (13) for a limited period of time, 

programmed through the electronic programmer (24) comprised in said logical 
unit (4). 
Safety system according to claims from 1 to 7 characterized in that said 
logical unit (4) may be associated to new transponders (13), to replace or be 

added to the transponder (13) already recognized by the it, by means of a 
control sent by the electronic programmer (24) so that it (13) will recognize 

them as authorized to dis-connect said immobilizer (10). 
Safety system according to claims from 1 to 8 characterized in that in an 
alarm condition (5) said immobilizer (10) may not be dis-activated by means of 

the identification of said transponders (13). 
Safety system according to claims from 1 to 9 characterized in that it 
comprises an emergency device (9) controlled by said logical unit (4) that is able 

to make a vehicle operative for a given period of time if said unit (3) should be 
damaged. 
Safety system according to claims from 1 to 10 characterized in that an 
alarm signal (19) is activated when, after having switched on the vehicle's 

instrument panel (6), said reader (12) does not detect said transponders (13) for 
a pre-set number of readings.
