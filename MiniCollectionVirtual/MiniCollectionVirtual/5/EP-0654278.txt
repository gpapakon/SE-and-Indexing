<ABSTRACT>
A volumetric pump for administering intravenous 
fluids to a patient comprises a housing having an 

elongate cavity therein with an open and a closed end. 
A resilient sheet of material having a centrally-located 

aperture covers the open end, and a pump shaft is 
slidably disposed through the aperture to form a 

sphincter seal therebetween. An inlet conduit leading 
from a fluid source (an IV bag) passes through the 

housing into the cavity near the open end thereof, and 
an outlet conduit leading to a fluid sink (the patient) 

passes through the housing from the cavity near the 
closed end thereof. The shaft is driven back and forth 

in reciprocating motion inwardly and outwardly of the 
cavity to produce, respectively, a positive pressure 

forcing fluid out of the outlet conduit to the fluid 
sink, and a negative pressure forcing fluid from the 

fluid source through the inlet conduit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lightweight,
inexpensive volumetric pump, suitable for a variety of
uses including medical systems such as intravenous (IV)
therapy systems and the like.The intravenous administration of fluids to
patients is a well-known medical procedure for, among
other things, administering life sustaining nutrients to
patients whose digestive tracts are unable to function
normally due to illness or injury, administering
antibiotics to treat a variety of serious infections,
administering analgesic drugs to patients suffering from
acute or chronic pain, administering chemotherapy drugs
to treat patients suffering from cancer, etc.The intravenous administration of drugs frequently
requires the use of an IV pump connected or built into
a so-called IV administration set including, for
example, a bottle of fluid to be administered and
typically positioned upside down, a sterile plastic
tubing set, and a pump for pumping fluid from the bottle
through the IV set to the patient. Other mechanisms may
be included to manually stop the flow of fluid to the IV
feeding tube and possibly some monitoring devices.Current IV pumps generally are of two basic types:
electronic pumps and disposable non-electronic pumps.
Although the electronic pumps have been significantly
miniaturized and do include some disposable components,
they are nevertheless generally high in cost, require
frequent maintenance with continued use, and may be 
difficult for a layman to operate if, for example, self
treatment is desired.The disposable non-electric pumps generally consist
of small elastomeric bags within a hard shell container,
in which the bags are filled with IV solution under
pressure. The pressure generated by the contraction of
the elastomeric bag forces the IV solution through a
fixed orifice at a constant flow rate into the patient's
vein. Although these pumps are much less expensive than
the electronic pumps and eliminate the need for
maintenance (since they are discarded after every use),
their drawbacks include the lack of monitoring
capability, the lack of the ability to select different
flow rates, limited fluid capacity, and still relatively
high cost for a disposable product.It is an object of the invention to provide a new
and improved volumetric pump which is especially
suitable for use in IV administration sets, other
medical systems, and the like.It is also an object of the invention to provide
such a pump configured to sweep bubbles from the pump
chamber during operation.It is a further object of the
