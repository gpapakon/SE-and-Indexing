<ABSTRACT>
A brush holder (10) for electric motors fitted with a collector has a base plate (11) of an injection moulded, electrically insulating plastic in which there are apertures (26, 27) for electrical components and two opposite tubes (51, 52) for carbon brushes. To provide brush holders which can be fitted fully automatically, each tube (51, 52) takes the form of a U-shaped carbon brush guide (16, 17) in the base plate (11) and a region (37) of a pressed screen (12) covering it which is fitted with a closing tab (39) for the tube (51, 52).

<CLAIMS>
Brush holder for an electric motor provided with a collector
and with a base plate (11) made of electrically insulating

material, preferably injection moulded plastics material, on
which receivers (26, 27) for electrical components are provided,

and with at least two opposing cartridges (51, 52) for carbon

brushes, wherein each cartridge (51, 52) is formed on the one
hand by a substantially U-shaped carbon brush guide (16, 17)

provided in the base plate (11) and, on the other hand, by a
pressed screen (12) covering the carbon brush guide (16, 17)

which pressed screen is provided with a sealing tab (39) for the
cartridge (51, 52), wherein a single pressed screen (12) is

applied to the base plate (11) for all cartridges (51, 52) and is
provided with appropriate electrical separating points (57, 61,

62), characterised in that a region (37) of the pressed screen
(12) covering the carbon brush guide (16, 17) is provided with a

terminal lug (55) for a flexible lead of a carbon brush (56),
wherein the terminal lug (55) for the flexible lead of the carbon

brush (56) is formed by an extension (37'), which is bent
upwards, of the region (37) of the pressed screen (12) covering

the carbon brush guide (16, 17) , wherein the sealing tab (39) for
sealing the cartridge (51, 52) is formed by an extension (39'),

which is laterally bent upwards, of a region of the pressed
screen (12) laterally delimiting the carbon brush guide (16, 17)

and wherein the region (37) of the pressed screen (12) covering
the carbon brush guide (16, 17) and the terminal lug (55) for the

flexible lead of the carbon brush (56) is provided with a
longitudinal slot (38) for the flexible lead of the carbon brush

(56) .
Brush holder according to claim 1, characterised in that the
pressed screen (12) is provided with terminal lugs (42 to 45) for

electrical components, such as thermostatic switches and/or
suppressor elements and/or the like. 
Brush holder according to claim 2, characterised in that a
separating point (57) can be introduced into the pressed screen

(12) between two terminal lugs (42, 43).
Brush holder according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the base plate (11) is provided with

sprayed-on parts (31, 32) by means of which it can be caulked to
the pressed screen (12).
