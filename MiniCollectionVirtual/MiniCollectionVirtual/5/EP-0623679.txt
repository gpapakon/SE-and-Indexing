<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a family of synthetic proteins 
having binding affinity for a preselected antigen, and 

multifunctional proteins having such affinity. The 
proteins are characterized by one or more sequences of 

amino acids constituting a region which behaves as a 
biosynthetic antibody binding site (BABS). The sites 

comprise V
H
-V
L
 or V
L
-V
H
-like single chains wherein the 
V
H
 and V
L
-like sequences are attached by a polypeptide 
linker, or individual V
H
 or V
L
-like domains. The 
binding domains comprise linked CDR and FR regions, 

which may be derived from separate immunoglobulins. 
The proteins may also include other polypeptide 

sequences which function, e.g., as an enzyme, toxin, 
binding site, or site for attachment to an 

immobilization media or radioactive atom. Methods are 
disclosed for producing the proteins, for designing 

BABS having any specificity that can be elicited by in 
vivo generation of antibody, for producing analogs 

thereof, and for producing multifunctional synthetic 
proteins which are self-targeted by virtue of their 

binding site region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compositions
of matter, hereinafter called targeted
multifunctional proteins, useful, for example, in
specific binding assays, affinity purification,
biocatalysis, drug targeting, imaging, immunological
treatment of various oncogenic and infectious
diseases, and in other contexts. More specifically,
this invention relates to biosynthetic proteins
expressed from recombinant DNA as a single
polypeptide chain comprising plural regions, one of
which has a structure similar to an antibody binding
site, and an affinity for a preselected antigenic
determinant, and another of which has a separate
function, and may be biologically active, designed to 
bind to ions, or designed to facilitate
immobilization of the protein. This invention also
relates to the binding proteins per se, and methods
for their construction.There are five classes of human antibodies.
Each has the same basic structure (see Figure 1), or
multiple thereof, consisting of two identical
polypeptides called heavy (H) chains (molecularly
weight approximately 50,000 d) and two identical
light (L) chains (molecular weight approximately
25,000 d). Each of the five antibody classes has a
similar set of light chains and a distinct set of
heavy chains. A light chain is composed of one
variable and one constant domain, while a heavy chain
is composed of one variable and three or more
constant domains. The combined variable domains of a
paired light and heavy chain are known as the Fv
region, or simply "Fv". The Fv determines the
specificity of the immunoglobulin, the constant
regions have other functions.Amino acid sequence data indicate that each
variable domain comprises three hypervariable regions
or loops, sometimes called complementarity
determining regions or "CDRs" flanked by four
relatively conserved framework regions or "FRs"
(Kabat et. al., Sequences of Proteins of
Immunological Interest [U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, third edition, 1983, fourth edition,
1987]). The hypervariable regions have been assumed
to be responsible for the binding specificity of
individual antibodies and to account for the
diversity of binding of antibodies as a protein class. Monoclonal antibodies have been used both as
diagnostic and therapeutic agents. They are
routinely produced according to established
procedures by hybridomas generated by fusion of mouse
lymphoid cells with an appropriate mouse myeloma cell
line.The literature contains a host of references
to the concept of targeting bioactive substances such
as
