<ABSTRACT>
An automated high resolution/definition image storage retrieval, and transmission system provides fast, efficient access to medical diagnostic images, e.g. X-ray images, simultaneously to a pluraity of requesting subscribers. This overcomes significant limitations of the prior art system that allowed only one user at a time to view a diagnostic image film that had to be physically transported to a different location for each viewing. The system digitizes images and stores the resultant data in a hierarchically compressed format on CD-ROMs (48). The data are subsequently downloaded, via the telephone lines, to a requesting subscriber in an optimal fashion. The data that are sent initially are used to create an initial, coarse, display of the image. Subsequent data are used to refine the resolution of the displayed image, up to a resolution limit set by the display terminal (20). This progressive enhancement process can be guided by the remote subscriber, who can select the most interesting areas of the image, to receive priority in the enhancement process.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: Automated High Definition/Resolution Image Storage Retrieval and Transmission SystemTechnical FieldThe invention provides an automated high definition/resolution diagnostic quality image storage, retrieval transmission, and display system for use with medical X-ray films and the like.Background ArtStorage and retrieval systems for medical image data such as X-ray films, CAT scans, angiograms, tomograms and MRI are commonly antiquated. For example, when image films are used in the operating room, the physician must display these photo films on a light box.Moreover, due to the diffuse responsibilities of multiple attending physicians and treatment sites, image data for patients with complex conditions is often lost, or at best, difficult to find when needed. Hospitals maintain large "file rooms" to store bulky patient image data films. In a complex situation in which several folders are needed, a file's weight can build up to 7 kg. It has proven time consuming to obtain image data from file rooms due to administrative backlogs, to lack of specialized filing personnel and to misfiling.Typically, the physician examines the patient in his office after radiographical studies have been made in a hospital or diagnostic facility. The relevant films and the information contained therein are often unavailable at the time of the examination. Thus, there is a need for remote access to image data for rapid patient assessment and therapy recommendation.US 4,603,254 teaches a stimulable phosphor sheet that stores a radiation image and that is read out by scanning with stimulating rays. The light emitted from the sheet is detected 

and converted into a digitizable electric signal used to reproduce the radiation image in diagnosis and storage.US 4,764,870 describes a system for transferring medical diagnostic information from a diagnostic site to remote stations.An internal analog video signal from imaging diagnostic equipment is converted to a standard format for storage and transmisison to a CRT display for reproduction of diagnostic images.US 5,005,126 shows a system for transferring medical diagnostic information from a diagnostic site to remote stations similar to that found in US 4,764,870.US 5,019,975 teaches a medical image database that tags records with the time at which each medical image was recorded and with a rank of importance for each medical image and that logs the number of times a given record was retrieved. When the database is full, the oldest and least important records are deleted to allow
