<ABSTRACT>
The metallic table for preparing food according to the invention comprises a table top (1) made from stainless steel with folded edges to form a front lip (2), two lateral lips (3) and a rear back (4). Separate corner elements (13, 14) fit into notches made in the steel and comprise engaging parts which are profiled in order to fit against the inner faces of the lateral lip (3) and of the front lip (2) or rear back (4). Fastening means make it possible to fasten the engaging parts to the metallic walls against which they are fitted.

Metal food preparation table for communal 
kitchens, comprising a table top (1) of stainless steel 

with folded edges, forming a forward edge (2), two 
lateral edges (3) and a rear backplate (4), 

characterised in that it comprises corner pieces (13, 
14) mounted in notches (40, 41) provided in the steel, 

each corner piece (13, 14) comprising: 

a first engaging portion (18) profiled to fit against 
the internal face of the adjacent lateral edge (3) to 

which it is secured by first securing means, 
a second engaging portion (19) profiled to fit 
against the internal face of the forward edge (2) or of 

the adjacent rear backplate (4) to which it is secured 
by second securing means, 
a central portion (15) having external faces (16, 17) 
in a corner configuration in order to extend the 

adjacent external faces of the lateral edge (3) and 
forward edge (2) or backplate (4), the said external 

faces (16, 17) connecting with the respective adjacent 
engaging portions (18, 19) by shoulders (20, 21) 

configured and positioned to cover the corresponding 
rims (22, 23) of lateral edge (3) and forward edge (2) 

or backplate (4). 
Table according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the shoulders (20, 21) are of a height substantially 

equal to the thickness of the stainless steel forming 

the table, so that the external faces (16, 17) of the 
corner pieces fit flush with the corresponding external 

faces of the lateral edge (3) and of the forward edge 
(2) or rear backplate (4). 
Table according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the corner pieces (13, 14) also 

comprise a third engaging portion (24) profiled to fit 
under the lower face of the table top (1). 
Table according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the first and second securing 

means of an engaging portion comprise: 

a through housing (25) provided in the engaging 
portion (19), the housing comprising a central portion 

(31) of reduced diameter adapted for passage of the 
shaft (32) of a screw (27) and connecting to an 

external end portion (33) configured to house the head 
(28) of the screw (27) and to an internal end portion 

(34) of wider cross-section with six faces for 
accommodating a tightening nut (26) for the screw (27), 
a nut (26) adapted to slide in the internal end 
portion (34) of the through housing (25), 
a screw (27) with a milled head (28), adapted to pass 
through the housing (25) and to screw into the nut 

(26), and comprising an axial hole (37) opening at 
least into its head (28), 
at least one stopper (29) formed of a head (38) of a 
diameter greater than that of the head (28) of the 

screw (27) and of a shaft (39) configured to fit and be 
wedged in the axial screw hole (37). 
a hole (30) provided in the corresponding table edge 
(2) or backplate (4), dimensioned and configured so  

 
that its wall receives and retains the peripheral 

portion of the lower surface of the head (28) of the 
screw (27).
