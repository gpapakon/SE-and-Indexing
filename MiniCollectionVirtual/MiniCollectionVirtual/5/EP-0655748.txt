<ABSTRACT>
An X-ray intensifying screen comprises a support and a layer containing a 
direct emission phosphor formed without a binder. The preferred direct emission 

phosphor is a rare earth silicate phosphor. Said X-ray intensifying screen is useful 
in the methods for recording and reproducing high energy radiation images. A 

process for the preparation of the binderless phosphor layer by reactive spray 
pyrolysis is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to X-ray intensifying screens and their
preparation, and more in particular to binderless X-ray intensifying screens and
their preparation by reactive spray pyrolysis.Some luminescent substances (phosphors), which comprise an inorganic
compound (host) generally activated with elemental ions (activators), emit light
(which is usually visible light but may be also infrared or UV radiation and is
generally called soft or low energy radiation) upon exposure to hard or high energy
radiation, such as X-rays, cathode rays, short UV rays.The soft radiation emission may be either a direct emission, i.e. the
phosphor emits light while it is still under irradiation (direct phosphor), or a
photostimulated emission, i.e. the irradiated phosphor emits light if stimulated by a
suitable stimulation light (stimulable phosphor).Direct emission phosphors find application in intensifying screens for
radiography in which the relevant luminescence of the phosphor is selected to be in
the band of higher sensitivity of either a silver halide photographic film (direct
radiography) or a photodetector (digital radiography) which are coupled to the
phosphor screen for detecting the emitted light. The X-ray intensifying screen
absorbs the X-rays and converts the X-rays, through luminescence, into light
energy to which the photographic film or the photodetector are sensitive. Screens
absorb a much larger fraction of X-rays than photographic films and photodetectors
do and thus are used in order to reduce the X-ray dosage.Among direct emission phosphors known in the art, the most efficient are
generally considered the gadolinium oxy-sulfide phosphors activated with terbium
(Gd2O2S:Tb), the barium fluoro-choride phosphors activated with europium
(BaFCl:Eu), the calcium tungstate (CaWO4), the yttrium tantalate phosphors
activated with niobium (YTaO4:Nb), the gadolinium tantalate phosphors activated 
with terbium(GadTaO4:Tb) and the rare earth silicate phosphors activated with
terbium and/or cerium.The X-ray intensifying screens are made of relatively thick layers of X-ray
absorbing phosphors which convert X-rays into light energy. Generally, X-ray
intensifying screens comprise a support having coated thereon a phosphor layer
which comprises phosphor particles dispersed into a suitable binder in a
phosphor-to-binder volume ratio between about 0.8/1 to about 4/1 and phosphor
coverages between about 100 g/m2 and about 2000 g/m2, as described for
example in Research Disclosure, vol. 184, item 18431, August
