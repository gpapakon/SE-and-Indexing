least three double bonds, the components of class a) 
excluded;

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to no drop and antifogging 
products, in particular films and plates, comprising a 
support consisting of acrylic polymers and a polymerized and 
U.V. light crosslinked coating, consisting of a mixture of 
particular acrylic monomers and of small amounts of hydrofilic 
metal oxides. It is known that one of the problems faced in the use 
of generally transparent plates, based on thermoplastic polymers 
such as polymethylmethacrylate is due to the surface 
condensation of water in the form of small or large drops 
which reduce the transparence thereof.
 
The prior art has suggested various surface treatments of 
said plates in order to avoid the above inconvenience, however 
with poor results as regards the maintenance during the 
time of the conferred no drop features or by employing complicated 
and polluting processes or, in the case of acrylic 
plates, conferring unwished yellowish colouring. It is known from DE patent 3.400.079 to treat plates of 
acrylic polymers, in particular polymethylmethacrylate 
(PMMA), by effecting a first surface coating with a layer of  
 
polymers unsoluble in water having a modest content of polar 
groups, applied by their solutions or dispersions, which in 
its turn is coated with a colloidal silica layer or colloidal 
metal oxides insoluble in water, applied through spraying 
of their solutions or dispersions. Such a process results complex and expensive as it comprises 
the application of two subsequent layers, it can result 
as polluting for the employments of solvents and often 
it does not allow the achievement of good adhesions of the 
layers applied to the polymeric plate.
 
In the European patent application EP 374.516, it is described 
the coating of transparent plates of thermoplastic polymers, 
in particular of polycarbonate, with a solution formed 
by at least 92% by weight of organic solvents and till 
8% of a mixture consisting of: 
a) a curable polyfunctional acrylic monomer, in particular 
1,6-hexandiol diacrylate, b) colloidal metal oxides, in particular silica, and c) a U.V. crosslinking catalyst, generally in amounts from 
1 to 10% by weight, in which the ratio by weight b/a 
varies from 1,9 to 19, and said solution is successively 
cured by U.V. light forming a crosslinked coating 
containing from 65 to 95% by weight of colloidal metal 
oxides. Such a process presents the inconveniences deriving 
from the use of high amounts of metal oxides requiring, in 
order to be disperded, high amounts of polluting and toxic 
solvents
