<ABSTRACT>
In an escalator according to the invention or a moving walkway, provision is made to cover a gap (44, 46) between a handrail (16) and a handrail guide section (14) via brushes (48, 50) serving as soft elements and thus to ensure not only a deflecting function in the area of the balustrade heads but also protection against catching over the course of the balustrade.

Escalator or passenger conveyor with a handrail leading
along a handrail guide curve lodged on a handrail guide

profile on a balustrade, where the handrail has a back and
angled sections on both sides attaching to the back, the ends

of which are turned towards the handrail guide profile, but
end at a distance from it to form a gap, characterised in that

brushes or bristles (48, 50) are attached to the handrail
guide profile (14) and/or the balustrade (12) which extend

along the gap (44, 46) to the ends of the angled sections (28,
30) of the handrail (16).
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to claim 1,
characterised in that the brushes or bristles forming non-rigid

elements (48, 50) extend on both sides of the balustrade
(12) towards the ends of both the angled sections (28, 30).
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the bristles (52, 54)

extend perpendicular to the direction of travel and in
particular slant slightly following the direction of travel. 
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that an essentially U-shaped

clamp mount (58, 60) is provided for the brushes (48,
50) and that the clamp mount (58, 60) is made of folded sheet

metal.
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that a clamp mount (58, 60)

for the brushes (48, 50) is screwed onto the handrail guide
profile (14), with the screws in particular as self-tapping

screws perforating the clamp mount (58, 60) and exerting a
clamping effect on the bristles (52, 54) of the brush (48,

50).
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the brush (48, 50) is

manufactured from a pre-fabricated strip of bristles (64, 66),
which is introduced into a clamp mount (58, 60) when this

brush is in a non-screwed on state and that the strip of
bristles (64,66) prior to the formation of an aligned brush

(48, 50) can be aligned with in particular perpendicularly
positioned bristles (52, 54) in the clamp mount (58, 60) and

the alignment can be defined by tightening the screw
connections.
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that non-rigid elements

forming brushes (48, 50) end in front of the ends of the
angled sections (28, 30).
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of claims 1
to 6, characterised in that non-rigid elements forming brushes

(48, 50) lie flexibly against the end of the angled section
(28, 30) of the handrail (16).
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the non-rigid elements

laid out as brushes (48, 50) extend away from a clamp mount
(58, 60) perpendicularly upwards and divergent from one

another, and that the tips of the bristles (52, 54) extend
beneath the end of the angled section (28, 30) from the front

surface of the angled section (28, 30) into the area in which
the angled section (28, 30) is curved.
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that tips of the bristles

(52, 54) of brushes forming non-rigid elements (48, 50) end
approximately at the same horizontal level.
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the bristles (52, 54)

of a brush forming a non-rigid element (48, 50) are made from
a flexible material and/or plastic or natural bristles.
Escalator or passenger conveyor according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the brushes (52, 54)

are laid out in pockets of a specially made handrail guide
profile, made of aluminium, plastic or similar material (14),

so that the clamp mount (56, 58) as well as the fixing screw
(68) are economised.
