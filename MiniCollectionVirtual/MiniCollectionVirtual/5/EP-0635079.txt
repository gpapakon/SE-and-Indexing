<ABSTRACT>
Composite roofing and cladding material comprising: (A) a bitumen-coated cellulose base material (1) combined with (B) a modified or unmodified, bitumen-coated, surfaced and impregnated glass mat to form a layer, which further includes on its outer side at least one material (3) selected from the group consisting of mineral granulates, slate flakes and non-foamed silicate lamellates, while the base material bitumen and/or cellulose substrate is further filled with at least one mineral or synthetic powder. An alternative embodiment includes a reinforcing element (4) inserted between materials (1) and (2). Application in fire-resistant roofing and cladding materials.

A composite roofing and cladding material, essentially composed of a
combination of:


(A) a bitumen-coated cellulose base material (1)

comprising
(B) a glass mat which is impregnated and surface-treated by means of

a bitumen or modified bitumen so as to form a coating (2),

and comprising in addition on its outer face at least one material (3) selected
from the group comprising mineral granules, slate flakes and unexpanded layer

silicates,
characterised in that
 the bitumen and/or the cellulose support of the base material is
filled in addition with at least one mineral or synthetic powder selected from doped

poly(vinyl chloride) or poly(vinylidene chloride) powders, and/or hydrated alumina,
hydrated magnesia, antimony trioxide or chlorinated paraffin wax, in a proportion

(weight/weight) of about 5 to 20 %, preferably about 10 to 16 %, of the bitumen-coated

cellulose support,

and that said material additionally comprises a layer of thermosetting resin on the
underside of the bitumen-coated cellulose support (1).
A material according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the powder which is
added as a filler to the bitumen and/or to the cellulose material is a fine synthetic PVC

powder which is stabilised with lead and which is doped with antimony oxide.
A material according to either one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the
bitumen used for impregnating and surface-treating the glass mat, with which it forms

a coating (2), is selected from direct distillation bitumens which are modified by the
addition of an elastomer.
A material according to claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the elastomer is an
elastomer of atactic polypropylene, of styrene-butadiene or of natural rubber. 
A material according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised that in that it
comprises active fillers which are suitable for the evolution of water vapour under the

action of the heat produced by a source of heat.
A material according to claim 5, 
characterised in that
 said active fillers are
hydrated alumina.
A material according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that
 it
additionally comprises a metal reinforcing element (4) between the panel (1) and the

coating (2).
A material according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the material (1) has a
cross-section in the form of corrugations which extend substantially sinusoidally, and

the reinforcing element (4) is a metal angle which covers at least a plurality of the
upper corrugations of said material (1).
A material according to claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the upper corrugations of
the material (1) have a radius of curvature which is less than that of the lower

corrugations.
A process for producing a composite roofing and cladding material,

characterised in that
:

a) a cellulose support (1) is produced, which is preferably corrugated or
contoured in another manner, and is filled with at least one mineral or synthetic

powder selected from doped poly(vinyl chloride) or poly(vinylidene chloride)
powders, and/or hydrated alumina, hydrated magnesia, antimony trioxide or

chlorinated paraffin wax, whilst said filler represents about 5 to 20 %, preferably
about 10 to 16 % (weight/weight), of the bitumen-coated cellulose support,
b) the aforementioned cellulose support is impregnated throughout with road
bitumen,
c) a bituminous coating (2) is applied, preferably by hot, intimate adhesive
bonding, to one face of the impregnated panel of material obtained, which bituminous

coating is reinforced with a glass fibre mat, and is coated on its opposite face with at 
least one material (3) selected from the group comprising mineral granules, which are

preferably coloured, slate flakes and unexpanded layer silicates, and a thermosetting
resin is additionally applied to the underside of said support.
A process according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 said road bitumen is
previously filled with at least one mineral or synthetic powder selected from doped

poly(vinyl chloride) or poly(vinylidene chloride) powders, and/or hydrated alumina,
hydrated magnesia, antimony trioxide or chlorinated paraffin wax.
A process according to claim 10, 
characterised in that
 metal elements (4) are
additionally intercalated between the panel (1) and the coating (2).
Use of a material according to any one of claims 1 to 9 for producing fire-resistant
roofing or cladding panels.
