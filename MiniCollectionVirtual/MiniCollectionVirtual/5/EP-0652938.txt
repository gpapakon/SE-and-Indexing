<ABSTRACT>
In a particulate enzyme-containing washing agent containing synthetic anionic tensides of the sulphate and/or sulphonate type, non-ionic tenside, a water-soluble organic builder and a water-insoluble inorganic builder, the cleaning performance is to be improved with the use of textile-softening cellulase without enzyme activation and without any loss of softening power in the presence of anionic tenside and a proteolytic enzyme. This has been achieved by optimising the constituents, especially the tenside components essentially in that the agent contains 10 to 25 wt % anionic tenside and so much non-ionic tenside that the ratio by weight of anionic tenside to non-ionic tenside is 1.5:1 to 20:1, and protease in such a quantity that it presents a proteolytic activity of 500 PE/g to 2000 PE/g and cellulase in such a quantity that it has a cellulolytic activity of 1 to 21 CEVU/g.

anionic surfactant of the sulfate and/or sulfonate type, a nonionic surfactant, 

a water-soluble organic builder, a water-insoluble inorganic builder, 
characterized in that it contains 10% by weight to 25% by weight of anionic 

surfactant and such a quantity of nonionic surfactant that the ratio by weight 
of anionic surfactant to nonionic surfactant is 1.5:1 to 20:1 and protease in 

such a quantity that it has a proteolytic activity of 1.14 mcatal/g to 4.56 
mcatal/g (500 PU/g to 2000 PU/g) and cellulase in such a quantity that it has 

a cellulolytic activity of 2.85 ncatal/g to 60 ncatal/g (1 CEVU/g to 21 CEVU/g), 
the nonionic surfactant component consisting of a mixture of a fatty alcohol 

having a low degree of alkoxylation of less than 7 with a fatty alcohol having 
a relatively high degree of alkoxylation of more than 7. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that it contains 
more than 12% by weight, preferably more than 14% by weight and more 

preferably from 15% by weight to 22% by weight of an anionic surfactant in 
the form of alkyl benzene sulfonate containing linear C

 alkyl groups, the 
Î±-sulfoesters derived from fatty acids containing 8 to 22 carbon atoms and, 

more particularly, 12 to 18 carbon atoms and linear alcohols containing 1 to 
6 carbon atoms and, more particularly, 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the sulfofatty 

acid disalts derived from these esters, ether sulfate and/or primary alkyl 
sulfate containing 10 to 20 carbon atoms and, more particularly, 12 to 18 

carbon atoms. 
A detergent as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it contains

alkyl sulfate or up to 25% by weight and, more particularly, 10% by weight to 

25% by weight of anionic surfactant which either consists entirely of alkyl 
sulfate or contains small amounts, more particularly no more than 30% by 

weight, based on the alkyl sulfate component, of ether sulfate and/or alkyl  
 

benzene sulfonate. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that it 
contains 2% by weight to 15% by weight of nonionic surfactant in the form of 

alkoxylates, more particularly ethoxylates and/or propoxylates, of linear or 
branched alcohols containing 10 to 22 carbon atoms and, more particularly, 

12 to 18 carbon atoms. 
A detergent as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that 
part of the nonionic surfactant, more particularly up to 50% by weight and

in particular, 60% by weight to 90% by weight of the alcohol with the low 
degree of alkoxylation is present.
