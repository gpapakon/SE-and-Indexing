<ABSTRACT>
An adhesive tape applicator comprises a base (6) which carries a 
support (8) for a roll of masking tape which is turnable about a vertical axis to 

permit tape to be drawn from the roll. The applicator is provided with forming 
means (13
a
, 13
b
) adapted to form and guide the tape as it is drawn from the 
applicator into respective longitudinal portions (T1, T2) extending at an angle to 

one another, and to guide the tape into contact with the object, so that the two 
longitudinal portions of the tape adhere to respective contiguous faces of an edge 

of the object. Tape is drawn from the roll around a guide roller (16
a
, 16
b
) prior 
to entry into the forming means (13
a
, 13
b
) and by maximising the distance 
between each roller and its associated forming means, tendency for tape to foul 

as it enters the forming means is reduced, ensuring that the tape is applied to the 
side edges of the object in a desired manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with an adhesive tape applicator. The applicator forming the subject of this invention has been devised 
primarily for use by painters and decorators for the purpose of applying masking 
tape to the edge of a carpet or other floor covering which abuts against a skirting 
board, so that the skirting board can be painted without getting paint on the 
adjacent edge of the carpet. In the specification of copending application GB-A-2247002 there is 
described an applicator for applying tape around two contiguous faces of an edge 
of an object such as a carpet, the applicator comprising a base, means to support 
a supply of adhesive tape on the base, means adapted on movement of the 
applicator along the edge of an object to form the tape as it is drawn from the 
supply into two longitudinal portions extending at an angle to one another and to 
guide the tape into contact with said object, so that the two longitudinal portions 
of the tape adhere to the respective faces. In use, masking tape is drawn from the 
supply around a roller through a cut-away portion which provides the forming 
means. Difficulty has been encountered in the use of the applicator of the kind 
described in the specification of said copending application, and it is one of the 
various objects of this invention to provide an improved applicator for applying 
tape around two contiguous faces of an edge of an object. According to this invention there is provided an adhesive tape adhesive 
tape applicator comprising a base, means to support a supply of adhesive tape on 
the base, means adapted on movement of the applicator along the edge of an 
object to form the tape as it is drawn from the supply into two longitudinal 
portions extending at an angle to one another and to guide the tape into contact 
with said object so that the two longitudinal portions of the tape adhere to 
respective faces of the object,
 
 
   characterised in that the applicator comprises two such forming means 
adapted to so form and guide the tape in respective opposite 
directions, each forming means being associated with a respective 
roller located in spaced relationship from said forming means. By the provision of two such rollers better forming of the tape as it 
passes through the forming means may be obtained. Preferably said forming means are each provided in the front edge of 
the applicator, and the rollers are located at opposite corner portions of the front 
edge. Preferably downstream of each forming means guide means is

<CLAIMS>
An adhesive tape applicator comprising a base (6), means (8) to 
support a supply of adhesive tape (T) on the base, means (13) adapted on 

movement of the applicator along the edge of an object (30) to form the tape (T) 
as it is drawn from the supply into two longitudinal portions (T1, T2) extending 

at an angle to one another and to guide the tape into contact with said object (30) 
so that the two longitudinal portions of the tape adhere to respective faces of the 

object, characterised in that the applicator comprises two such forming means 
(13a, 13b) adapted to so form and guide the tape in respective opposite 

directions, each forming means (13a, 13b) being associated with a respective roller 
(16a, 16b) located in spaced relationship to said forming means. 
An applicator according to Claim 1 wherein said forming means (13a, 
13b) are each provided in the front edge (12) of the applicator, and the rollers 

(16a, 16b) are located at opposite corner portions of the front edge. 
An applicator according to one of Claims 1 and 2 wherein located 
downstream of each forming means (13a, 13b) guide means (20a, 22a; 20b, 22b) 

is provided, against which the formed tape may be pressed as the tape is applied 
to the object (30). 
An applicator according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
each of said forming means (13a, 13b) is located immediately adjacent to one of 

the roller (16b 16a) associated with the other forming means. 
An applicator according to any one of the preceding claims wherein 
the outer surface of each roller (16a, 16b) is located so that one of the faces of 

the forming means extends as a tangent thereto.
