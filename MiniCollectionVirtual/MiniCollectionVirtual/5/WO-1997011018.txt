<ABSTRACT>
A pre-stretching mechanism, for use in an orbital wrapping apparatus whereby a web (6) of plastics film is drawn from a feed roll (5) of film and applied to an object to be wrapped by virtue of relative rotational movement of the object and the roll, comprises a braking roller (9) in contact with the feed roll, a stretching roller (7) in contact with the web and drive transmission means (10, 11, 12) connecting the rollers such that the surface speed of the stretching roller in the direction of film movement exceeds that of the braking roller in that direction, wherein the feed roll is mounted for rotation upon slideable saddles (16) and the contact pressure between the braking roller and feed due to tension in the drawn-off web is augmented by loading springs (18) to an extent such that slippage occurs between the feed roll and the braking roller before draw-off tension in the web reaches a value at which the web would neck down and break.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FILM STRETCHING MECHANISMTECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to packaging processes in which an object to be packaged (which may be a single article or a plural assembly of articles) is wrapped in pre-stretched plastics film. More particularly, the invention relates to the mechanism used to stretch the film immediately before it is applied to the object. Such processes are frequently referred to as stretch wrapping processes and such mechanisms are frequently referred to as pre-stretching mechanisms.BACKGROUND ARTStretch wrapping utilises film having the property known as "memory", that is to say a tendency to recover its former shape or size, after having been strained beyond its elastic limit, some short while after the straining force has been relaxed.Plastics wrapping film is normally provided to the user as a feed roll of unstretched film. Film is customarily drawn from the roll and applied to the object by securing an end of the film to the object, and then either rotating the object or orbiting the feed roll around the object. A number of types of pre-stretching mechanisms have been proposed hitherto whereby the web of film extending from the feed roll to the object is stretched as it is drawn from the roll before being applied to the object.Such pre-stretching of the film is advantageous for a number of reasons, for example; 

 the pre-stretched film may be applied to the object under a relatively low lay-up tension, as the subsequent contraction of the film ensures a desirably tight wrap (this is particularly advantageous when an assemblage of relatively small or lightweight articles is to be wrapped, because it reduces the likelihood of the articles being displaced by the wrapping process),moderate or properly controlled pre-stretching improves the mechanical properties of the film, andit is economical, in that a given weight of film may be extended to provide effectively more wrapping material.The simplest and least desirable prior known pre-stretching apparatus merely applies a brake to the roll of film. Such apparatus is disclosed, for example, in US patent 3,867,806 (Lancaster) and US patent 4,077,179 (Lancaster). In these and other instances wherein a brake is applied to the feed roll, the stretching is induced by using a high lay-up tension. This suffers from the disadvantages inherent in the use of a high lay-up tension indicated above. Furthermore, stretching occurs throughout the whole length of the flight of web extending from the feed roll to the object, so that the overall

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:-
1. A wrapping apparatus including a pre-stretching mechanism whereby, in use, a web of plastics film is drawn from a feed roll of film and applied to an object to be wrapped by virtue of orbital movement about the object of a shuttle carrying said feed roll, wherein the pre-stretching mechanism comprises a braking roller mounted on the shuttle for rotation about an axis that is fixed relative to the shuttle, a stretching roller mounted on the shuttle for rotation about an axis which is fixed relative to the shuttle, parallel to the braking roller axis and spaced therefrom, drive transmission means connecting the said rollers such that the surface speed of the stretching roller exceeds that of the braking roller, mandrel means for the rotational support of a feed roll of stretch wrap film mounted on said shuttle by guide means allowing the mandrel means to move freely towards the braking roller under the influence, in use, of tension in a web of film drawn from the feed roll and passing around said stretching roller, and supplementary loading means acting independently of the web tension to supplement the effect of the web tension in urging the feed roll towards the braking roller to maintain braking contact therebetween.
2. Wrapping apparatus according to claim 1 wherein said guide means comprise two slideable saddles respectively supporting ends of the mandrel means, and said supplementary loading means comprise springs acting between said saddles and said shuttle.
3. Wrapping apparatus according to claim 2 wherein said saddles are movable along guide rods and each of said springs is sleeved upon a respective guide rod. 


 4. Wrapping apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims wherein said braking roller is surfaced with a soft elastomeric material.
5. Wrapping apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein said supplementary loading means are such that the maximum pressure obtained between the braking roller and the feed roll is such that slippage between the braking roller and feed roll occurs prior to the web tension reaching breaking point.
6. A method of wrapping at least part of an object in plastics film comprising the steps of loading a shuttle with a feed roll of the film, attaching an end of the film to the object, causing the shuttle to orbit said at least part of the object and pre-stretching the film as it is drawn from the feed roll by the relative movement between the object and the shuttle prior to its application to the object, wherein said feed roll is free to move bodily into contact with a braking roller under the effect of tension in the film departing from the feed roll and the step of pre-stretching the film is effected by the steps of drawing the film from the feed roll around a stretching roller connected to the braking roller by drive transmission means ensuring that the surface speed of the stretching roller is greater than that of the braking roller, and augmenting the effect of the tension in the film in maintaining contact between the feed roll and the braking roller by applying a supplementary force urging the feed roll towards the braking roller and having a value that is not dependent on the film tension.
7. A method according to claim 6 wherein said supplementary force has a magnitude such that the maximum pressure obtained between the braking roller and the feed roll is such that slippage between the braking roller and feed roll occurs prior to the web tension reaching breaking point. 


 8. A pre-stretching mechanism for use in a wrapping apparatus whereby, in use, a web of plastics film is drawn from a feed roll of film and applied to an object to be wrapped by virtue of relative rotational movement between the object and the roll, said pre-stretching mechanism comprising: a supporting chassis; a braking roller mounted on the chassis for rotation about an axis that is fixed relative to the chassis; a stretching roller mounted on the chassis for rotation about an axis which is fixed relative to the chassis, parallel to the braking roller axis and spaced therefrom; drive transmission means connecting the said rollers such that the surface speed of the stretching roller exceeds that of the braking roller; mandrel means for the rotational support of a feed roll mounted on said chassis by guide means allowing the mandrel means to move freely towards the braking roller under the influence, in use, of tension in a web drawn from the feed roll and passing around said stretching roller, and; supplementary loading means acting independently of the web tension and supplementing the web tension in urging the feed roll towards the braking roller to maintain braking contact therebetween at a pressure such that slippage between the braking roller and feed roll occurs prior to the web tension reaching breaking point.
