<ABSTRACT>
The consumption rate of at least one additive to an industrial 
process in an industrial 

process is determined. The additive (22) is added to at least 
one upstream process stream (12) that feeds 

into at least one process zone (14) in which the additive is at least 
partially consumed. Any additive 

residual leaves the process zone in at least one downstream process 
stream. The consumption 

rate is determined by a method comprising:
 

   adding the additive to the process stream or each of the upstream 
process streams in an 

additive feed that contains an inert tracer in known proportion to the 
additive;

 
   monitoring the concentration of the inert tracer in the upstream 

process stream or each of 
the upstream process streams (24) and in the downstream process 

stream (26) or each the downstream 
process streams;

 
   determining the concentration of the additive residual in the 

downstream process stream 
or in each of the downstream process streams;

 
   calculating the rate of additive consumption in the process 

zone; and
 

   optionally making a consumption-responsive additive feed rate 
adjustment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the technical field of monitoring the process consumption of 
additives in industrial processes, such as raw and waste water treatment processes, 
manufacturing processes and the like, so as to increase the efficiency thereof and provide a 
consumption-responsive control of additive feed. The process consumption of additives in industrial processes has been monitored 
primarily by the determination of the additive residual downstream of the additive-consuming 
site and then estimating the process demand for the additive from that residual determination 
together with approximate determinations of additive feed rate and other influences on additive 
concentration. The rate at which the additive is fed to the industrial process is generally not 
subject to accurate determination through readings and/or settings on the additive feed system. 
The additive is at least partly consumed during the process, and the rate of additive consumption 
is also not subject to accurate determination using the standard industrial process plant controls 
and/or equipment. The rate of additive consumption is generally determined by a comparison 
between additive residual levels and the additive feed rate, which again is not precisely known.  
 
Operating parameters other than additive consumption in the process may influence the level of 
additive residual downstream of the additive-consumption site, such as dilution when other 
additives are charged to the system concentration by evaporation or other means, unaccounted 
log of fluid from the system and the like. These other influences throw off the consumption rate 
estimates. This combined lack of accurate additive feed rate readings and lack of accurate 
additive consumption rates (process demand for the additive) in a industrial process plant 
severely diminishes the sensitivity of any additive-consumption responsive adjustment of the 
additive feed rate, and diminishes the ability to follow changes in the additive's consumption rate 
with appropriate compensations to the additive feed rate. More accurate analysis techniques are 
generally not practical because feedback information would most probably be days behind the 
sampling and hence of little value. The process consumption rate of an additive would routinely 
have changed during the interval. A sensitive consumption-responsive control of additive feed would render most any 
industrial process more efficient. Overfeeding of an additive is unnecessarily expensive, may at 
times diminish
