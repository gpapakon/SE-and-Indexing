<CLAIMS>
Catalyst comprising a porous organic or mineral
support and a mixture constituted by sulphuric

acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and,
optionally, water, the support being impregnated by

said mixture and, before impregnation, having a
specific surface area of between 0.01 and 1500

m
2
/g, a total pore volume of between 0.005 and 3
cm
3
/g and being principally constituted by
substantially spherical particles having an average

diameter of between 80 and 150 µm, said mixture
having a composition by weight between the

following limits:

sulphuric acid: between 80 and 99.5 %,
trifluoromethanesulphonic acid: between 0.5
and 15 %,
water: between 0 and 5 %.
Catalyst according to claim 1 wherein said support
is silica.
Catalyst according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein
said support, before impregnation with said

mixture, contains at most 2 % of impurities. 
Catalyst according to any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein the composition by weight of said mixture

is between the following values:

sulphuric acid: between 85 and 99.5 %,
trifluoromethanesulphonic acid: between 0.8
and 15 %,
water: between 0.05 and 3 %.
A process for the preparation of a catalyst
according to any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein said

support is calcined then impregnated with a mixture
constituted by sulphuric acid,

trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and, optionally,
water.
Use of a catalyst in accordance with any one of
claims 1 to 5 in an alkylation process which treats

a feedstock comprising at least one isoparaffin
selected from the group formed by isobutane and

isopentane and at least one olefin containing 3 to
6 carbon atoms per molecul
e.
Use according to claim 6 wherein the reaction
temperature is below 0°C.
