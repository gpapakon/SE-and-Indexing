<ABSTRACT>
An information catalog database system (2) is disclosed for 
cataloging information stored in one or more data storage resources (12-24) 

under the control of one or more data processing nodes (4). The 
catalog system (2) includes a cataloging service facility (60)_for 

performing one or more information cataloging functions to organize and 
present a graphical view of the information stored in the data storage 

resource (12-24). The information cataloging functions are categorized 
into a plurality of defined function categories. An object generation 

facility generates one or more meta-data objects corresponding to units 
of information stored in the data storage resource (12-24). The meta-data 

objects contain attributes defining characteristics of the 
information units to which they correspond and the meta-data objects are 

assigned to one or more of the function categories to define the 
information cataloging functions which may be performed on the meta-data 

objects. A user interface is provided for executing the information 
cataloging functions on the meta-data objects in response to user input.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to information
management, and more particularly, to systems for cataloging information
managed by one or more data processing nodes for use by non-data
processing professionals having access thereto. Still more particularly,
the invention relates to a system for providing catalog system product
functionality within an environment of fully user extendable user-defined
information.One of the challenges facing administrators of databases used by
businesses and other enterprises is to ensure that the information
therein is fully and efficiently available to and accessible by non-data
processing professionals. Knowledge workers are those persons within an
enterprise whose function is to make decisions, or recommendations, in
response to unanticipated events (e.g. changing business conditions).
Those individuals must have ready access to all relevant information
available to the enterprise, but may not know, or want to know, the
unique naming schemes, expression statements or semantic modelling
required to retrieve the information, particularly when that information
extends over several information management systems having differing
storage and delivery paradigms. Knowledge workers need to locate
information on terms that are understandable and intuitively apparent to
them.A requirement therefore exists for an information catalog system
that allows non-data processing professionals to define information
objects on their own terms, and to search, query, retrieve and otherwise
manipulate the "real world" information represented by those objects for
consideration and analysis. This presents a challenge to product
developers to produce a product whose objects are defined by the user
base but whose functionality remains fixed. End users must be free to
generate object types of their own creation but must be constrained in
their ability to assign product functionality thereto. European Patent Application 0 472 070 discloses an electronic
library metaphor having shared books that allow object oriented data
bases to be organised and accessed and create a visual hierarchy of
related and shared objects.Research Disclosure, RD347015, 10 March 1993 discloses a meta-object
containing key attributes for searching a database and for
displaying, printing, copying and storing programs.European Patent Application 0 585 813 discloses data processing
apparatus for executing a process by combining objects. the objects to
be combined are identified by an object command. Each of the

<CLAIMS>
An information catalog generation and modification system (2)
for cataloging information stored in a data storage resource

(12,14,16,18,20,22,24), comprising:

cataloging means (26, 260,270) adapted to perform one or more information
cataloging functions to organize and present a graphical view of the

information stored in the data storage resource;
catalog function categorization means (26), including a user
interface, adapted to allow users to categorize said information cataloging

functions into a plurality of predefined cataloging function categories
(40,42,44,46,48,50);
object means (26, 220) including a user interface, adapted to allow users to
generate a meta-database (28) containing one or more user-defined objects, each of said

objects corresponding to a unit of information stored in the data storage
resource, and

containing attributes defining
characteristics of the information unit to which they correspond,and

said user-defined objects being assigned to one or more of said.
cataloging function categories, whereby each of said one or more cataloging function categories defines specitic information cataloging

functions which can be performed on said user-defined objects;
means (26,240,250) including a user interface, adapted to
allow users to perform said information cataloging functions on said

user-defined objects; and
tag language means (30,32) adapted to create said user-defined objects by interpreting tag language statements, said tag language statements being obtained
by reformating said units of information stored in said data

storage resource.
A system as claimed in claim 1 wherein said object means includes means adapted
to allow users to extend the attributes of one or more of said user-defined

objects any thereby to generate additional user-defined objects.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said object
means includes means adapted to allow users to prevent the generation of additional

user-defined objects in one or more cataloging function categories. 
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said object
me
ans includes means adapted to allow users to generate said attributes from a set of
predefined attributes and means adapted to allow users to generate additional

attributes.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said catalog
function categorization means includes means adapted to allow users to

categorize one or more cataloging functions into mutually exclusive cataloging
function categories.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said object means
includes a user interface

adapted to allow users to execute user-defined object
setup commands.
A system as claimed in any preceding claim wherein said cataloging
means performs a searching function that includes searching user-defined

objects based on the attributes thereof, an object listing function that
includes generating lists of searched user-defined objects, a navigation

function that includes generating navigatable user-defined object tree
hierarchies, and a launching function that includes launching programs

that utilize information defined by said user-defined objects.
A system as claimed in claim 7 wherein said catalog
function categorization means includes means adapted to allow users to

generate a grouping category containing said object listing and
navigation functions.
A system as claimed in claim 7 wherein said catalog function
categorization means includes means adapted to allow users to generate a

program category containing said program launching function.
