<ABSTRACT>
In a vacuum concentrating plant, a feed liquid supplied (5,13) into a 
vacuum pan evaporator (3) is heated indirectly by a latent heat by 

introducing depressurized vapor into a steam jacket added to an outer 
periphery of a lower portion (4) of the vacuum pan evaporator. In this 

manner, the feed liquid in the vacuum pan evaporator is boiled and 
concentrated in a concentrating zone within the vacuum evaporator. The 

depressurized vapor used for heating the feed liquid is obtained by 
heating water in a depressurized vapor generator (20) by means of a 

heating 
source (33) in a heat pump. On the other hand, the vapor generated in 

the 
vacuum evaporator is cooled and condensed in a vapor condenser by means 

of a cooling source (38) in the heat pump and removed in the form of 
a drain 

outside a circuit system. A concentrate as a product is withdrawn 
outside the circuit system through a concentrate withdrawing line (14) 

by an 
operation of a pump. Thus, in this vacuum concentrating plant, it is 

possible to provide a high heat efficiency, an excellent stability of 
the operation and a low running cost by a combination of the vacuum pan 

evaporator, the depressurized vapor generator and the heat pump. 
Further, it is possi
ble to concentrate the feed liquid at a low 
temperature of 60Â°C or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum concentrating plant for 
concentrating a feed liquid at a relatively low temperature by a 
heating evaporation thereof, which is used to concentrate, for example, 
a fruit juice, an enzyme, a naturally occurring coloring matter, an 
yeast extract, a protein solution, an organic acid, a naturally 
occurring flavoring matter, nucleic acid, medicines or the like, or to 
concentrate a solution having a low boiling point to recover a solvent 
therefrom, and particularly, to such a vacuum concentrating plant in 
which an extremely high heat efficiency can be achieved by combination 
with a heat pump. The EP-A-0006612 discloses a vapor generating and recovering 
apparatus for vaporizing a liquid and condensating a vapor, the 
apparatus including a complementary condenser system on the high 
pressure side of the means to compress a refrigerant. The US-A-4638642 discloses a heat pump using water as a 
refrigerant, the heat pump comprising an evaporator equipped 
with a feedwater control device and a draining device, a 
compressor and a condenser with a vacuum generating means.  
 Further, there is a conventionally known and used plant for concentrating 
the feed liquid at a relatively low temperature, which utilizes a 
heating by warm water. However, the concentrating plant utilizing the 
heating by warm water suffers from a disadvantage that the time of 
start-up of the plant is longer, and a longer time is required for 
changing the set temperature, because saturated steam is usually used as 
a heating source. In order to reduce the start-up time, a vacuum 
concentrating plant utilizing a heating by depressurized vapor has been 
developed. This plant is designed to generate saturated steam under a 
reduced pressure of 0.2 to 1.466 bar 
(150 to 1,100 Torrs) to indirectly heat a feed liquid  
 
by a latent heat of this steam. In the above prior art vacuum concentrating plant, the start-up 
time thereof is shorter, and the set temperature is easy to change. 
Moreover, the temperature cannot be abnormally risen, leading to a high 
stability. However, the above prior art plant suffers from many 
disadvantages. For example, because steam is drawn by using a vacuum 
pump or an ejector, a large loss of steam is brought out, and because of 
a large number of components for a circuit system, a great deal of 
labor is required for maintenance. Further, it is difficult to set the 
vapor pressure at 0.2 bar (150 Torrs) or more and hence, the temperature of 
heating steam cannot be
