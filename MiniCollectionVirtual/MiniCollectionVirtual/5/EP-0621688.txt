<ABSTRACT>
A high-impedance circuit includes a differential 
pair circuit (Tr6,Tr7) composed of a first transistor and a second 

transistor, and a buffer circuit. The buffer circuit 
includes an NPN type transistor pair (Tr3,Tr5,Tr8,Tr9) composed of a 

cascade connection of NPN type transistors, and a PNP 
type transistor pair (Tr2,Tr4,Tr10,Tr11) 

composed of a cascade connection of 
PNP type transistors, and bases of the NPN type 

transistors and bases of PNP type transistors 
respectively corresponding to the NPN type transistors 

are connected to each other, respectively so as to 
constitute current mirror circuits. An output of the 

differential pair circuit is connected to a cascade 
connection point of the NPN type transistor pair (Tr3,Tr5,Tr8,Tr9), 

and an 
emitter of an NPN type transistor (Tr5,Tr8) included in the NPN 

type transistor pair is connected to the ground via a 
constant current source (I2,I4), and the emitter is connected to 

bases of the first transistor (Tr6) and the second transistor (Tr7) 
via resistors (R1), respectively. Therefore, the output of 

the differential pair circuit is fed-back to inputs of 
the differential pair circuit, i.e. the bases of the 

first transistor and the second transistor as base 
currents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a high-impedance
circuit. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a high-impedance circuit having
high-impedance, which is incorporated in an integrated
circuit.Figure 17 is a circuit diagram showing a
conventional example, wherein a reference numeral 1
denotes a high-impedance circuit which is constructed by
transistors and resisters. In the high-impedance
circuit 1, an equivalent resistor R between bases of
transistors T1 and T2 can be evaluated in the following
manner.At first, it is assumed that a base voltage of the
transistor T1 is V1, and a base voltage of the
transistor T2 is V2. An emitter voltage of the
transistor T1 becomes equal to the base voltage thereof,
and therefore, becomes V1 in an alternating current.
Similarly, an emitter voltage of the transistor T2
becomes V2. Then, a voltage VBB1 between bases of a transistor
T3 and a transistor T4 which constitutes a differential
pair is shown by the following equation (1).
VBB1 = V0 x R2 R1 + R2 + R3
where, V0: a difference between V1 and V2.Furthermore, in the same way, a voltage VEE1
between emitters of the transistors T3 and T4 becomes
equal to the equation (1), and is represented by the
following equation (2).
VEE1 = VBB1
= V0 x R2 R1 + R2 + R3Therefore, since differentiation resistors re exist
at sides of the emitters of the transistors T3 and T4 of
the differential pair, respectively, a current IE1
flowing in each of the differentiation resistors re can
be shown by the following equation (3).
IE1 = VEE1 (re + re)
= V0 x R2 R1 + R2 + R3 x 1 2reTherefore, the equivalent resistor R between the
bases of the transistors T1 and T2 is shown by the
following equation (4). 
R = V0 IE1
= R1 + R2 + R3 R2 x 2reThen, if a collector current of a transistor T5
which is a constant current source is I5, each of the
differential resistors re of the transistors T3 and T4
of the differentiation pair can be evaluated according
to the following equation (5).
re = 52(mV) I5The same assignee has proposed a high-impedance
circuit in Japanese Patent Application No. 4-16008 (H01C
13/00) on the basis of such a principle. Figure 18 is a
circuit diagram showing the proposed prior art, wherein
a reference numeral 10 denotes a high-impedance circuit
which is connected to a signal source 12. An input from
the signal source 12 is applied to a point between a
buffer circuit 14 which includes a PNP type transistor
T7 and NPN type transistors T8 and T9, and a buffer
circuit 20 which includes a PNP type transistor T12
