<ABSTRACT>
A thickness measurement of a specimen is obtained by applying 
a DC magnetic field to the specimen of level placing at least a 

portion of the specimen in a near magnetically saturated state and 
determining the incremental magnetic permeability at the surface of 

the portion of the specimen and deriving therefrom the thickness of 
the portion of the specimen. The determining step of the method is 

preferably practiced in part by inducing and detecting eddy 
currents in a surface of the specimen bounding the portion. 

Systems and apparatus for implementing the method are set forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the non-destructive 
examination of objects and pertains more particularly to methods 
and apparatus for obtaining thickness measurements of objects 
responsive to the influence of magnetic fields. In the prior art, plate or wall thickness is measured 
non-destructively by the use of ultrasonic techniques which fall 
into two categories. One technique is generally referred to as the 
pulse-echo method, wherein a water or oil based couplant transmits 
a sound wave generated by a transducer to the object. The other 
technique, referred to as the EMAT (electro-magnetic acoustic 
transducer) method, involves a strong, near-saturation level DC 
(direct current) magnetic field acting as a couplant for the sound 
wave. The pulse-echo method is more suited to a statistical sampling 
or secondary verification approach especially on large plates in 
above the ground oil-storage tanks having numerous tank bottom 
plates. The EMAT method is more suitable to periodic wall 
thickness measurements of critical end-use tubing for oil wells, 
power plants and like applications. Although ultrasonic techniques for thickness measurements are 
generally easy to use and considered to be highly accurate on 
non-corroded, newly-produced products, they can be much more  
 
difficult to implement, as well as erroneous in output at times, 
when used on corroded products such as aged tank bottom plates. 
Such difficulties and errors can be caused by loss of coupling due 
to delaminated surface scale and/or poorly adhering epoxy laminate 
coatings. They can also be caused by excessive beam diffraction 
and uncontrolled beam reflections or deflections due to corrosion 
caused by non-parallel opposing plate sides. The present invention has as its primary object the provision 
of improved methods and apparatus for thickness measurement of 
specimens to be non-destructively tested. A more particular object of the invention is to provide 
specimen thickness measuring methods and apparatus which overcome 
the above-noted disadvantages of prior art ultrasonic thickness 
measuring practices and systems. In attaining the foregoing and other objects, the invention 
provides, in its broad method aspect, practice wherein applicants 
obtain a thickness measurement of a specimen by applying a DC 
magnetic field to the specimen of level placing at least a portion 
of the specimen in a near magnetically saturated state and 
determining the incremental magnetic permeability of the portion of 
the specimen and
