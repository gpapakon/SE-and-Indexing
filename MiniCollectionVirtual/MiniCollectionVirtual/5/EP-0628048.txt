<DESCRIPTION>
 META LO-ORGANIC PRECURSORSThis invention relates generally to metallo-organic precursors. More particularly, the invention relates to novel metallo-organic precursors which are useful for chemical vapor deposition and pyrolysis, and to their methods of preparation. This invention also contemplates novel processes for preparing titanium nitride by chemical vapor deposition and pyrolysis.Metallo-organic precursors have been used in recent years to prepare advanced materials such as titanium nitride, vanadium nitride, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, etc. These advanced materials advantageously have been deposited onto transparent glazings, e.g., glass, and other substrates by well-known coating processes such as, for example, atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) , low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) , plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) , laser induced chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) , and the like.Glazings having these advanced materials coated thereon are particularly useful in automotive and architectural applications which require reduced solar and infrared radiation transmittances. Titanium nitride is a particularly useful advanced material having several desirable properties such as, for example, high melting point (2,950°C), high hardness (8-9 on the Moh scale) , excellent strength, high electrical conductivity, excellent solar and infrared reflectances, and nonreactivity with a variety of corrosive atmospheres. Furthermore, it is substantially unaffected by acids, excepting aqua regia; however, alkali compounds may cause its decomposition.Conventional methods for preparing titanium nitride include the high temperature reaction of a source of titanium such as, for example, titanium tetrachloride with a source of nitrogen such as, for example, ammonia. Such a method is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,535,000 to Gordon. 

This chemical vapor deposition process has been used to form a film of titanium nitride on a ribbon of glass as it is being produced by the well-known float glass process. It is known to prepare titanium nitride by the pyrolysis of a polymeric precursor formed by reacting ammonia with a titanium dialkylamide. See Brown, G. M. and Maya, L. , "Ammonolysis Products of the Dialkylamides of Titanium, Zirconium, and Niobium as Precursors to Metal Nitrides," Journal of the American Ceramic Society, v. 71 (1988) 78-82. Specifically, a titanium dialkylamide such as, for example, tetrakis(dimethylamido)titanium is reacted with liquid anhydrous
