<ABSTRACT>
A deflection apparatus for high perveance ion 
beams, operating at 20Hz fundamental and substantially 

higher order harmonics, has a magnetic structure formed of 

laminations (72) with thickness in range between 0.2 and 1 
millimeter. A compensator with similar laminated 

structures (71,75) with resonant excitation circuit, 
operating at 20 Hz or higher, is in phase locked 

relationship with the frequency of the previously 
deflected beam. Other features with broader applicability 

to produce strong magnetic field in magnetic gap are shown.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems for utilizing
ion beams such as in ion implanters and more generally to
magnetic systems that apply strong magnetic fields to
working gaps.Modification of semiconductors such as silicon
wafers is is often implemented by ion implanters, wherein a
surface is uniformly irradiated by a beam of ions or
molecules, of a specific species and prescribed energy.
Usually, the physical size of the wafer or substrate
(e.g. 8 inches or greater) is larger than the
cross-section of the irradiating beam which deposits on
the wafer as a spot of finite size (e.g. 1'' x 2").
Commonly, in high current machines, the required uniform
irradiance is achieved by mechanical scanning of the
wafer through the beam, either by reciprocal motion of
the wafer, or a combination of reciprocal motion and
rotation about an axis.It is distinctly advantageous to have a high
scanning velocity at least in one direction for a number
of reasons: the irradiance uniformity is more immune to
changes in the ion beam flux; a higher wafer throughput
is possible at low dose levels; for high dose
applications degradation from local surface charging,
thermal pulsing, and local particle induced phenomena
such as sputtering and radiation damage are greatly
reduced.All forms of mechanical scanning are very limited
in speed and have the further disadvantage of generating
particulates which degrade the surface structures on the
wafer. In a common variation, a time varying electric
field is used to scan the beam back and forth in one
direction, while the wafer is reciprocated in another
direction or rotated about an axis. In this hybrid type
of implanter the beam current and hence rate at which
wafers can be processed is severely limited by the space
charge forces which act in the region of the time-varying
electric deflection fields. These forces cause the ions
in the beam to diverge outwards, producing an
unmanageably large beam envelope. Such a space charge
limitation also occurs in implanters which use time-varying
electric fields to scan the beam in two
directions.Space charge blow-up is the rate at which the
transverse velocity of a beam increases with distance
along the beam axis. This is proportional to a mass
normalized beam perveance
Î¾ = I M 1/2 E -3/2
where I is the beam current, M is the ion mass, and E is
the ion energy. (The Physics and Technology of Ion
Sources, Ed. Ian G. Brown, John Wiley & Sons, New York
1989). For typical ion beam configurations encountered
in ion beam implanters, space charge effects
