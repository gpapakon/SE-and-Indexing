<ABSTRACT>
Section of adhesive film for a temporary bond,     a) comprising a double-sided adhesive film, b) whose adhesive surfaces have been rendered non-adhesive in areas lying opposite one another in an offset manner, where   c) the non-adhesive areas overlap only slightly or not at all, and d) the adhesive bond produced therewith can be separated by pulling apart the non-adhesive areas, in particular by pulling in the direction of the bond plane.

<CLAIMS>
Adhesive-film section for a rereleasable bond, 

a) comprising a double-sided adhesive film, 
b) whose adhesive areas have been given a non-adhesive 
treatment on regions in staggered opposition to one 

another, 
c) the non-adhesive regions having little or no overlap, 
and 
d) the adhesive bond produced therewith being separable 
by pulling apart the adhering regions, especially by 

pulling in the direction of the bond plane. 
Adhesive-film section according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that it is extensible plastically or 

elastically with or without intermediate supports. 
Adhesive-film section according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the adhesion of the adhesive film 

is lower than the cohesion, the adhesiveness largely 
disappears when the film is extended, and the ratio of 

pulling force to tearing load is at least 1:1.5. 
Adhesive-film section according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the adhesive film is based on 

thermoplastic rubber and tackifier resins, with high 
elasticity and low plasticity. 
Adhesive-film section according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the non-adhering regions have a 

non-tacky coating material or a laminated-on layer 
material, such as a paper or a plastics film. 
Adhesive-film section according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that it is treated with an intermediate 

support of little or no extensibility which if desired is 
provided with a predetermined breaking point, such as a 

cut, partial cut or a perforation on the line, at which 
point the non-adhering regions meet with lateral offset. 
Adhesive-film section according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the adhering regions are covered 

with a release laminate, such as a siliconized release 
paper or a release film, and, in particular, grip tabs 

are provided for pulling off the release laminates.  
 
Adhesive-film section according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the non-adhering regions are 

designed such that they extend around one edge, 
especially the upper and lower end edge of the adhesive-film 

section, and thus form grip tabs with which the 
adhesive-film section or its residues, after bonding and 

rerelease have taken place, can be pulled off.
