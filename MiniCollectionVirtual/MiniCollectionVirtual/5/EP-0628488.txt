<ABSTRACT>
Container for the transport, storage and dispensing of chemical products comprising an inner casing made from a plastic material containing fluorine, in particular PFA, provided at its upper part with a stopper device traversed by filling and dispensing connections, and an outer casing having a substantially cylindrical external shape and an internal shape substantially matching that of the inner casing. The outer casing (1) consists of a cylindrical section (6) which is integral at its bottom with a base (7) of quadrangular cross-section and of cross-sectional area greater than that of the cylindrical section of the outer casing.

<CLAIMS>
Container for the transportation, storage and 
distribution of chemicals, which includes an inner shell 

(2) made of fluorinated plastic, in particular made of 
PFA, and which is provided at its upper part with a 

sealing device (3) penetrated by filling and distribution 
connections, and an outer shell (1) having an external 

shape which is substantially cylindrical and an internal 
shape w
hich substantially matches that of the inner 
shell, characterized in that the outer shell (1) consists 

of a cylindrical part (6) which is integral, at its lower 
part, with a base (7) of quadrangular cross-section and 

of cross-sectional area greater than that of the 
cylindrical part of the outer shell. 
Container according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the said base (7) has a rectangular shape. 
Container according to either of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the said base (7) has, at its lower 

part, feet (8). 
Container according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the outer shell (1) is surmounted

that the annular lid (5) has a frustoconical general 

shape, the protuberances (16) being truncated-cone 
segments. 
Container according to any one of the preceding  
 

claims, characterized in that the sealing device (3) is 
fixed to a collar (13) provided at the upper part of the 

inner shell (2) and has a frustoconical lower elongation 
(15) capable of being housed in the said collar which, 

for this purpose, includes an inner wall (14) of corresponding 
frustoconical shape. 
Container according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the inner shell (2) has a 

cylindrical part (9) and convex upper and lower parts 
(12), the said cylindrical part (9) being placed radially 

away from the cylindrical part (6) of the outer shell 
(1). 
Container according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the inner shell (2) is 

reinforced with composite materials, especially with 
polyester and glass fibres.
