<ABSTRACT>
The coupling incorporates studs (11) on the tool (3) which engage with recesses (38) in the tool carrier (32), while a surface (4) of the tool has a horizontal cross-member (10) at the bottom equipped with two studs, and a pair of lugs (15) at the top. The lugs are parallel with one another and with the working plane of the tool, and each one has an aperture (18) which is open towards the bottom. The tool holder has a cross-member (37) with recesses for the studs, and a horizontal axle (40) at the top to engage with the lugs. The lower ends of the lugs are extended in the form of two divergent plates located on either side of the cross-piece to act as guides for the upper end (41) of similar plates on the tool holder. The apertures in the lugs have sides which are parallel or converge slightly.
