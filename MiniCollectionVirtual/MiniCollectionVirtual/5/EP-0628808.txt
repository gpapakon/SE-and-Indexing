<ABSTRACT>
For measuring the weight per unit area (basis weight, grammage) of a paper web (10), a radioactive source (16) is arranged on one side of the paper web (10) and a semiconductor detector (20) in the form of a photodiode array is arranged on the other side of the paper web in a measuring head (12, 14). The photodiode array is covered against visible light by means of a metal foil (30).

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for measuring the basis weight of a laminer material (10) under test, as e.g. 
paper, plastic foil or textile fabric, comprising a radioactive source (16) on one side of 

said material and a semiconductor detector (20) on the other side of said material, 

characterized in that
 said semiconductor detector (20) is segmented 
according to a photodiode line array (22
1
-22
n
) and is transversely moved with respect 
to said material under test (10) and that means are provided which, besides the 

detection of the individual currents of each photodiode (22
1
-22
n
) of the array 
implement an averaging of the photo currents of equal positioned photodiodes with 

respect to the material under test. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized by
 an aperture (18) 
between the radioactive source (16) and the photodector line array (20), whereat the 

opening of the aperture is matched to the geometry of the photodetector line array. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 an amplifier 
(24
1
-24
n
) is connected to each photodiode (22
1
-22
n
) of the line array (20). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 
the photodiode line array (20) is located on a cooling element (28) being stabilized 

with respect to temperature. 
Apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 besides said 
photodiode line array (20) said amplifiers (34; 24
1
-24
n
) and corresponding highly 
resistive resistors (35) are arranged on said cooling element (28) being stabilized with 

respect to temperature. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by
 
web guiding elements (32, 32') in order to conduct the material (10) under test over 

the photodiode array (20) with a predetermined distance.
