 BULLET-RESISTANT TRANSPARENT PANEL , AND METHOD AND PRESS FOR MAKING SAMERELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part . application to my Application Serial No. 843,337 filed February 28, 1992, which application is still pending.FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a bullet- resistant transparent panel, and also to a method and presses for making such a panel.Many types of bullet-resistant transparent panels are known. One type, as described for example in US Patent 4,594,290, includes transparent sheets of a-'.-ylic and polycarbonate resins bonded together by a transparent polyurethane adhesive. The invention of the present application is directed particularly to the latter type of bullet-resistant transparent panel.OBJECTS AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a transparent panel, particularly of the type described in US Patent 4,594,290, exhibiting unidirectional bullet-resisting characteristics; that 

is, the panel blocks the penetration of a bullet when fired from the outer side of the panel, but not when fired from the inner side of the panel.Another object of the invention is to provide a method of making transparent panels, and a further object is to provide a press particularly useful for making such transparent panels.According to the present invention, there is provided a transparent panel effective to block the penetration of a bullet when fired from the outer side of the panel but not when fired from the inner side of the panel, the transparent panel comprising: an outer transparent sheet of an acrylic resin having a thickness of 7.5-9 mm, and an inner transparent sheet of a polycarbonate resin having a thickness of 9.5-11 mm, the sheets being bonded together by a polyurethane transparent adhesive.It has been surprisingly found, as will be shown more particularly below, that when the acrylic and polycarbonate sheets are of the above thicknesses, the laminated panel exhibits unidirectional bullet- resisting characteristics. Such a panel construction thus provides protection against outsiders attacking persons inside an enclosure, such as a vehicle, a protective teller's cage, or the like; but at the same 

time the panel permits insiders to fire against the attacking outsiders.Best results were obtained when the outer acrylic resin sheet has a thickness of about 8 mm, the inner polycarbonate resin sheet has a thickness of about 10 mm, and the transparent polyurethane adhesive has a thickness of

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A transparent panel effective to block the penetration of a bullet when fired from the outer side of the panel but not when fired from the inner side of the panel, said transparent panel comprising: an outer transparent sheet of an acrylic resin having a thickness of 7.5-9 mm, and an inner transparent sheet of a polycarbonate resin having a thickness of 9.5-11 mm, said sheets being bonded together by a polyurethane transparent adhesive.
2. The panel according to Claim 2, wherein said outer acrylic resin sheet has a thickness of about 8 mm, and said inner polycarbonate resin sheet has a thickness of about 10 mm.
3. The panel according to Claim 1, wherein said transparent polyurethane adhesive has a thickness of about 2 mm.
4. The transparent panel according to Claim 1, wherein each of said sheets includes a scratch- resistant coating on the face thereof not bonded to the other sheet.
5. The transparent panel according to Claim 1, wherein both said sheets are of curved configuration. 


 6. The panel according to any one of Claims 1-5, further including a plurality of glass sheets bonded to each other and to said outer acrylic sheet.
7. The panel according to Claim 6, wherein said plurality of glass sheets include: an outer glass sheet of 9-14 mm thickness; an intermediate glass sheet of 9-14 mm thickness; and an inner glass sheet of 3-6 mm thickness bonded to the outer face of said acrylic sheet.
8. The panel according to Claim 6, wherein: said outer glass sheet is of 10 mm thickness; said intermediate glass sheet is of 10 mm thickness; and said inner glass sheet is of 4 mm thickness.
9. The panel according to Claim 6, wherein: said outer glass sheet is of 12 mm thickness; said intermediate glass sheet is of 12 mm thickness; and said inner glass sheet is of 4 mm thickness.
10. The method of making a transparent panel, comprising: forming a sheet of an acrylic resin and a sheet of a polycarbonate resin of the same size and configuration; applying a sealing strip around the peripheral edge of one of the sheets; applying the 


other sheet over the one sheet with the two sheets spaced from each other by said sealing strip; drilling two holes through one of the sheets adjacent its diagonally opposite edges; applying pressure to the opposite faces of the two sheets to press them against the sealing strip; injecting under pressure an adhesive liquid through one hole of the one sheet until it exits from the other hole thereof; and permitting the adhesive to harden to bond the two sheets together.
11. The method according to Claim 6, wherein said sealing strip is applied around the peripheral edge of the acrylic resin sheet.
12. The method according to Claim 6, wherein said holes are drilled through said polycarbonate resin sheet.
13. The method according to Claim , wherein the acrylic resin sheet and the polycarbonate resin sheet are each individually precurved to the desired curvature by supporting the respective resin sheet on a glass panel having the desired curvature and heating 
'
 the resin sheet and glass panel to a temperature sufficiently high to soften the respective resin sheet, but not to soften the glass panel, and thereby to cause the respective resin sheet to assume the curvature of the glass panel. 


 14. The method according to Claim 6, wherein said pressure is applied during injection of the adhesive to the opposite faces of the two sheets by a press having a fixed frame assembly, and a movable frame assembly movable with respect to said fixed frame assembly; each of said frame assemblies including a plurality of parallel pressure bars extending transversely across the respective frame; said press further including a plurality of adjustable devices for precisely positioning the pressure bars against .opposite surfaces of the panel.
15. The method according to Claim 10,- wherein said plurality of adjustable devices include a piston and cylinder coupled to each of the pressure bars
'
 in each of the frame assemblies.
16. The method according to Claim JO , wherein said plurality of adjustable devices includes a manually adjustable screw and nut for each of the pressure bars in each of the frame assemblies.
17. The method according to Claim 10, wherein each of said pressure bars includes a resilient cushioning layer for directly contacting the respective surface of the panel.
18. The method of Claim 10, wherein each of said pressure bars includes an inflatable boot for 


directly contacting the respective surface of the panel.
19. A press for laminating a plurality of sheets, comprising: a fixed frame assembly, and a movable frame assembly movable with respect to said fixed frame assembly; each of said frame assemblies including a plurality of parallel pressure bars extending transversely across the respective frame; said press further including a plurality of adjustable devices for precisely positioning the pressure bars against the opposite surfaces of the panel.
20. The press according to Claim 15, wherein said plurality of adjustable devices include a piston and cylinder coupled to each of the pressure bars in â€¢ each of the frame assemblies.
21. The press according to Claim 15, wherein said plurality of adjustable-devices includes a manually adjustable screw and nut for each of the pressure bars in each of the frame assemblies.
22. The press according to Claim 15, wherein each of said pressure bars includes a resilient cushioning layer for directly contacting the respective surface of the panel.
23. The press according to Claim 15, wherein each of said pressure bars includes an inflatable boot 


for directly contacting the respective surface of the panel.
