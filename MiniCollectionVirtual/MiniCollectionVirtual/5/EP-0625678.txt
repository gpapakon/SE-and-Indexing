An air-conditioning installation for the human domain, particularly for living and working
areas, - having at least one outlet duct (2) for the fresh air to be introduced into a room (3) to be

air-conditioned and having a fresh air outlet (1) at its end, wherein at least one flow alignment
means (5) is disposed in the fresh air outlet (1) and comprises a plurality of alignment elements

(6) having flow alignment paths (9) as well as an alignment element surface (7) over which the
fresh air flows, and wherein the fresh air outlet (1) with the installed alignment means (5) is

constructed as a streaming air outlet, characterised in that the alignment element surface (7) is
coated and/or impregnated with a germicidal substance (8).
An air-conditioning installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the flow
alignment means (5) is equipped with alignment elements (6) which generate a low-turbulence

flow, which is mainly laminar, in the emerging fresh air.
An air-conditioning installation according to claim 1, characterised in that the flow
alignment means (5) is equipped with alignment elements (6) which generate a substantially

homogeneous, isotropic turbulence in the emerging fresh air.
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the flow alignment elements (6) are constructed as intersecting strips, rods or wires.
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the flow alignment elements (6) are constructed as webs between holes in a plate, wherein the

holes form the flow alignment paths (9).
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the flow alignment elements (6) are constructed as webs of a honeycomb structure, wherein the

channels of the honeycomb structure form the flow alignment paths (9). 
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
the flow alignment means (5) is constructed as a porous plate with communicating, open pores,

the pore walls of which form the alignment elements (6) and the pore spaces of which form the
flow alignment paths (9).
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the flow alignment elements (6) are made of a porous material with open pores, and are

impregnated, at least in the region of their alignment element surfaces (7), with germicidal
substances (8).
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the flow alignment elements (6) have a coating of a porous material, and the coating is

impregnated, at least in the region of its coating surface, with the germicidal substance (8).
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that
a turbulence-generating grid is disposed in front of the flow alignment means (5) on the

impingement side thereof.
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that the flow alignment means (5) has an alignment element surface area F which is matched to

the mass flow M for which the fresh air outlet (1) is designed, according to the matching rule
M / F = 2.5 to 1000 mm

/sec/mm
2
.
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that in the direction of flow of the fresh air the flow alignment means (5) has a depth and the flow

alignment paths (9) have a free cross-section which are designed so that at least 50 % of the
molecules of the fresh air come into contact with the alignment element surfaces (7).
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in
that the flow alignment means (5) is designed for a pressure drop from about 5 to 40 Pa in the

fresh air which passes through the flow alignment means (5). 
An air-conditioning installation according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in
that the flow alignment means (5) is constructed as an interchangeable module and is replaceably

inserted in the fresh air outlet (1).
