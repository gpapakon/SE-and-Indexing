<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a pacemaker, a dual chamber 
VDD(R) or DDD(R) pacemaker, having improved features for 

avoiding undesired sensor-sinus competition and providing 
blended sensor and sinus (atrial) control. The pacemaker 

employs atrial hysteresis which is used during sensing of 
natural atrial beats in order to enable tracking the sinus 

signals that occur at rates below the current pacing limit; 
and sensor hysteresis which prevents early takeover by sensor 

control and, in a DDDR pacer, controls when the sensor rate 
controls over a sensed sinus rate and also enables dropping 

the pacing rate during sensor control so as to enable finding 
and tracking of underlying lower rate sinus signals. The 

sensor hysteresis function is automatically adapted by 
obtaining and processing scattergram data representative of 

the sensor rate compared to the average of the natural sinus 
rate, and adjusting the sensor hysteresis function to 

optimally match the data.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention lies in the area of rate-responsive
cardiac pacemakers and the method of operation of same and,
more particularly, dual chamber rate responsive pacemaker
systems having blended sinus and sensor control so as to
optimize tracking of a reliable sinus rate while permitting
sensor control where atrial signals are non-physiological or
otherwise unreliable.Dual chamber rate responsive pacemakers are now
widely available from pacemaker manufacturers. Such
pacemakers may be of many types, including the types
designated as DDDR or VDDR. The DDDR pacemaker paces and
senses in both chambers, i.e., both the atrium and the
ventricle, and has rate responsive (RR) backup to provide
pacing in the absence of sensed natural beats, or to provide
rate responsive ventricular pacing during atrial
tachyarrhythmias in the absence of natural ventricular beats.
The DDDR pacemaker has a lead that is placed within the
atrium to deliver atrial pace pulses, as well as to sense
natural atrial (sinus) signals, and a ventricular lead for
pacing and sensing in the ventricle. In contrast, the VDDR
pacemaker paces only in the ventricle, although it senses in
both the atrium and the ventricle. The VDDR pacemaker system
may be made simpler by incorporating a single lead, which has
a floating atrial electrode for sensing atrial signals, in a
known manner. The VDDR pacemaker is indicated for patients 
who are determined to have a good and reliable sinus rate, so
that for a good bit of the anticipated lifetime of the
patient, natural atrial signals will be present from which
ventricular pace pulses can be tracked, thereby providing
synchronized pacing.For DDDR and VDDR pacemakers, there is an inherent
desirability of maximizing use of the sinus rate, i.e.,
avoiding takeover of the pacing function as long as a good
atrial signal is present and sensed. For a rate responsive
pacemaker, this leads to the desirability of correlating the
rate response as closely as possible to the sensed natural
sinus, while still enabling the rate response to take over
pacing control when and if the sinus does not accurately
reflect cardiac demand. Thus, for example, if a patient
develops chronotropic incompetence after implant of a VDDR
pacemaker, there must be an ability to switch modes or
otherwise enable the sensor response to override the sinus.The prior art indicates many schemes for adjusting
rate response as a function of exercise. Such schemes
include algorithms for ramping up rate upon the onset of
exercise, and ramping down rate after
