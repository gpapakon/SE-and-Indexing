<ABSTRACT>
In an optical coupling device for optically coupling 
an optical fiber (5) to an optical waveguide (2) formed on a 

crystalline substrate (1), the optical fiber (5) is placed in a 
V-shaped groove (4A) formed on the substrate (1) by anisotropic 

etching. The V-shaped groove (4A) is not linearly continuous, 
but intermittent to intermittently support the optical fiber (5). 
The intermittence of the V-shaped groove (4A) decreases 
undesired width expansion of the V-shaped groove (4A). For 

this structure, a light axis alignment between the optical fiber 
(5) and the optical waveguide (2) is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical coupling device for
optically coupling an optical fiber and an optical waveguide, and
more particularly to, an optical coupling device in which the
position alignment between an optical fiber and an optical
waveguide is obtained with high precision and simple
manipulation.In providing an optical communication system, an
optical exchange system, etc, optical devices such as an optical
modulator, an optical combining and branching device, an optical
switch, an optical multiplexing and demultiplexing device etc.
are generally used as based structural elements. These
devices generally comprise optical waveguides. For this
structure, it is inevitable to optically couple optical
waveguides and optical fibers. The importance of the optical
coupling between optical waveguides and optical fibers is
enhanced under the situation where subscriber's networks have
been increasingly changed to optical systems replacing electric
systems, and optical devices have been more and more integrated
into semiconductor substrates. In accordance with this
tendency, the characteristics such as low loss of light, easy
fabrication, stability against external force and heat are
required for the optical devices.Conventionally, an optical fiber and an optical
waveguide are positioned to lower optical coupling loss to the
minimum extent by using an optical jig, and fixed at the smallest 
coupling loss-position by using optical adhesive.In this method of coupling the optical fiber to the
optical waveguide, however, there are disadvantages in that
(1) the position adjustment takes a long time,(2) the optical coupling process is carried out one by
one to lower the mass-productivity, and(3) the reliability is low against external force.In order to overcome the disadvantages, an optical coupling
device for optically coupling an optical fiber to an optical
waveguide has been proposed, for instance, as described on pages
391 to 395 of "Applied Optics, Vol. 13, No. 12, February 1974",
on pages 166 and 167 of "Integrated Photonics Research, TuD 6-1
and TuD 6-2", and on page 4-315 of "the Spring session in the
electron information and communication academic society, 1993".The conventionally proposed optical coupling device
comprises an optical waveguide having a core layer and a clad
layer provided on a silicon substrate, and a V-groove formed on
the silicon substrate to be aligned to the core layer of the
optical waveguide.In assembly, an optical fiber is positioned in the V-groove
on the silicon substrate to
