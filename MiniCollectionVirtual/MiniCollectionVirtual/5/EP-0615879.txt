<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises at least two parallel rails (12) fixed to the floor of the vehicle and two slides (14) integral with the seat, which can slide on the rails (12) and are equipped with means, which can be deactivated with the aid of a manual control borne by the frame of the seat, for locking the slides in any one of several longitudinal positions. The locking means comprise housings distributed along the rails, these being intended to receive a lock bolt borne by the slides (14) and pushed back towards a position of engagement in one of the housings. The manual control includes a member which can be displaced along the slide from a position of rest in which it leaves the lock bolt free to engage in one of the housings towards a position in which it moves the lock bolt away from the housings.

A device for adjusting the longitudinal position of 
a seat in a motor vehicle, comprising at least two 

parallel rails (12;112) attached to the floor of the 
vehicle and two slides (14;114), to which the seat is 

attached, the slides being slidable along the rails 
(12;112) and having means, disengagable via a manual 

control, for locking the slides in any of a number of 
longitudinal positions, said locking means comprising 

recesses (28;128) spaced along at least one of the 
rails; a bolt (30;130) borne by at least one of the 

slides (14;114); and return means (141) which urge the 
bolt towards a position of engagement in one or more of 

the recesses, characterised in that the slide also 
supports an actuating member (32;132) displaceable 

parallel with the slide by means of said manual control, 
which is borne by the frame of the seat, from an inoperative 

position, in which it leaves the bolt (30;130) 
free to engage in one or more of the recesses (28;128), 

to a position in which it moves the bolt away from the 
recesses against the force of the return means (141). 
A device according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
the seat bears a control linkage enabling said actuating 

member (32;132) to be displaced longitudinally in relation 
to the slide. 
A device according to Claim 1 characterised in that 
each slide (14;
114) bears at its ends fingers or rings 
(16;116) for the support of front and rear supports (18) 

of the seat and the attachment of disengagable latches 
(20) mounted on said supports. 
A device according to Claim 3 characterised in that 
the actuating member (32;132) bears against the bolt 

(30:130) via one or other of two bearing surfaces each 
forming an angle with the direction of the slide  

 
(14;114) and with the direction of displacement of the 

bolt (30;130) in relation to the slide; said two bearing 
surfaces being symmetrical with one another in relation 

to the direction of displacement of the bolt, so that 
the longitudinal position of the seat can be adjusted 

when the seat is placed on the slide in one or other of 
two positions 180Â° away from one another. 
A device according to Claims 2 and 4 characterised 
in that the linkage controlling the longitudinal displacement 

of said actuating member (32;132) includes one of 
the latches (20b) mounted on the supports of the seat, 

which is applied against one end of said actuating 
member for its displacement along the slide when said 

latch is disengaged. 
A device according to any of Claims 1 to 5 characterised 
in that the bolt (30) can slide vertically in 

relation to the slide (14) and is urged downwardly by 
the return means to become engaged in one of the recesses 

(28), and said actuating member is formed by a plate 
(32) having at least inclined bearing face which lifts 

the bolt when said plate is displaced from its inoperative 
position. 
A device according to Claims 4 and 6 characterised 
in that the plate comprises two inclined bearing faces 

forming the flanks of a V-shaped notch. 
A device according to any of Claims 1 to 5 characterised 
in that the recesses (128) are located on one 

side of the rail (112); the bolt (130) can slide laterally 
in relation to the slide (114) and has a vertical 

coupling rod (131); and said actuating member is formed 
by a plate (132) having an aperture (139) whose periphery 

comprises at one surface which bears against the 
coupling rod and forms an angle with the direction of 

the slide (114) and with the sliding direction of the 
bolt (130), to move the bolt away from the recesses  

 
(128) when the plate (132) is displaced from the inoperative 

position. 
A device according to Claims 4 and 8 characterised 
in that the periphery of the aperture (139) of the plate 

comprises two bearing surfaces which are symmetrical in 
relation to the direction of sliding of the bolt. 
A device according to Claims 8 or 9 characterised 
in that the return means are formed by a spring (141) 

installed between a flank of the slide (114) opposite 
from the recesses (128) and the coupling rode (131) of 

the bolt. 
A device according to Claim 10 characterised in 
that the bolt (130) is disposed beneath the slide (114) 

and is supported by the spring (141) which bears against 
a shoulder (129) with which the coupling rod (131) is 

formed. 
A device according to Claim 3 characterised in that 
the rail (112) has a generally U-shaped section, two 

protective brushes (162) being provided in the upper 
portion of the rail between the arms of the U to close 

the inside of the rail in which the slide (114) is 
installed, each slide comprising, around the fingers or 

rings supporting the supports (166), spreaders (164) to 
allow the supports to pass between the brushes (162) 

when the seat is displaced longitudinally. 
A device according to Claim 12 characterised in 
that the slide is generally U-shaped, the ends of the 

branches of the U each comprises a longitudinal bore 
(168); each finger supporting the support (166) is 

connected at its two ends to respective studs (172) each 
formed with a bore (168a) corresponding to one of the 

longitudinal bores of the slide; one spreader (164) 
comprises two outwardly directed transverse flanges 

(174) disposed on each side of one of the studs and each 
formed with an opening (168b) corresponding to the bores  

 
of the slide and the stud; and two pins (176) are engaged 

respectively in the two longitudinal bores of the 
slide for the simultaneous assembly of the finger and 

the spreaders on the slide. 
A device according to any of the preceding Claims 
characterised in that each slide (14;114) rests on the 

respective rail (12;112) via small plastic rods (22;122) 
each trapped in two longitudinal grooves (113,115) 

opposite the slide and rail. 
A device according to Claims 13 and 14 characterised 
in that the studs (172) connected to the fingers 

supporting the support and/or the flanges (174) of the 
spreaders project laterally of the slide at the longitudinal 

grooves (115), to wedge the small plastic rods 
(122) longitudinally. 
A device according to any of the preceding Claims 
characterised in that another pairs of rails are attached 

evenly spaced-out to the floor of the vehicle, so

for engagement in the rings (16) characterised in that 

each of the front supports (18) at least as a primary 
latch and a secondary latch both able to tilt around an 

axis on the respective support, the secondary latches 
(20
b
) being disengagable independently of the primary 
latches (20
