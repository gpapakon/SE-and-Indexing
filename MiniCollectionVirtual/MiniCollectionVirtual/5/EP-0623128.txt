<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to indoles of general formula (I), wherein R0 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-3 alkyl group; R1 represents a group R4CONH-, R4R5NSO2-, R4SO2NH- or R4R5NCO- (where R4 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-6 alkyl group, provided that R4 does not represent a hydrogen atom when R1 represents R4SO2NH-, and R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-6 alkyl, C3-7 cycloalkyl, phenyl or phen(C1-3)alkyl group in which the phenyl ring is optionally substituted by a halogen atom or a C1-4 alkoxy, hydroxy or C1-3 alkyl group); R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-3 alkyl, C3-6 alkenyl, phenyl or phen(C1-3)alkyl group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom, a C1-3 alkyl group or a group -CO2R6, -COR6, -COCO2R6 or -CONHR6 where R6 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1-4 alkyl, C3-7 cycloalkyl, C3-6 alkenyl, aryl or ar(C1-4)alkyl group in which the aryl group may be unsubstituted or substituted by a halogen atom or a C1-4 alkoxy, C1-4 alkyl or hydroxy group (provided that when R3 represents -CO2R6, R6 is other than hydrogen); n represents zero or an integer from 1 to 5; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
 -INDOLE DERIVATIVESThis invention relates to indole derivatives, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their medical use, in particular to compounds and compositions of use in the treatment of migraine.It has been suggested that the pain of migraine may be associated with excessive dilatation of the cranial vasculature and known treatments for migraine include the administration of compounds having vasoconstrictor properties such as ergotamine. However, ergotamine is a non-selective vasoconstrictor which constricts blood vessels throughout the body and has undesirable and potentially dangerous side effects. Migraine may also be treated by administering an analgesic usually in combination with an antiemetic but such treatments are of limited value.More recently, indole derivatives which are selective 5HT,-Hke receptor agonists and which exhibit selective vasoconstrictor activity have been described in the art as useful in the treatment of migraine.We have now found a novel group of indole derivatives which exhibit 5HT.-like receptor agonist activity and selective vasoconstriction.Thus, the present invention provides a compound of formula (I):wherein R0 represents a hydrogen atom or a C,.3alkyl group;R, represents a group R4CONH-, R^NSO.,-, R4SO2NH- or R4R.NCO- (where R4 represents a hydrogen atom or a C,^ alkyl group, provided that R4 does not represent a hydrogen atom when R, represents R4SO2 H-, and Rj represents a hydrogen atom or a 

 C..6 alkyL, C^ cycloalkyl, phenyl or phen(C..3)aIkyl group in which the phenyl ring is optionally substituted by a halogen atom or a CM alkoxy, hydroxy or C._3 alkyl group); Rj represents a hydrogen atom or a CU3 alkyl,C3^ alkenyl,phenyl or phen(Cι_3)alkyl group; R3 represents a hydrogen atom, a C._3 alkyl group or a group -COjRg, -CORg, -COCOJ-lg or -CONHRg where Rg represents a hydrogen atom or a CM alkyl, ^ cycloalkyl, C^ alkenyl, aryl or ar(C,^)al--ςyl group in which the aryl group may be unsubstituted or substituted by a halogen atom or a CM alkoxy, CM alkyl or hydroxy group (provided that when 3 represents -COjRg, Rg is other than hydrogen); n represents zero or an integer from 1 to 5; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.As used herein an alkyl group either as such or as part of a phenalkyl, alkoxy or alkoxycarbonyl group may be a straight chain or branched chain alkyl group, for example a methyl, ethyl, or prop-2-yl group. A C-^ alkyl group is conveniently C,_3 alkyl such as methyl. A ^ cycloalkyl
