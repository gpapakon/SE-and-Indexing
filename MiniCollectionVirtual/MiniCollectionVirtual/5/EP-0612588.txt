<ABSTRACT>
In a control device for electric tools, in particular for electric hand tools such as (multi-speed) hand drills, drilling and percussion hammers, screwdrivers and the like, it is proposed, to arrest the tool spindle (16) (lock function) by positive engagement, to mount in an actuating element (20), e.g. a turning knob, which is accessible from outside and manually adjustable, on the tool housing a slide (32) which is itself additionally movable in the radial direction and, in the spindle-arresting position, arrests the spindle rotational movement by means of an arresting member (35) actuated by it, and in this spindle-arresting position the rotatable actuating element at the same time defines an idle-running position in the transmission connection between driving electric motor and spindle.

An electric tool, in particular an electric hand tool such as a hand drill, a multiple-speed 
hand drill, a hammer drill, a screwdriver and the like, with a switching device for locking 

the tool spindle (16), also called a locking function, by engagement with positive locking, 
wherein a manually adjustable rotary knob (20) - accessible from the outside - on the 

tool housing (11, 11a) has an angular setting which determines an idling position in the 
gearing connexion, and the setting of the locking function is forcibly synchronized geometrically 

with positive locking with the torque interruption produced by the idling position 
between the driving electric motor and the tool spindle, 
characterized in that
 the 
rotary knob (20) supports a slide (32) itself additionally movable - in this angular setting 

which determines the idling position - in the radial direction into a spindle-locking position 
in which a locking member (35) driven by the slide (32) locks the rotational movement 

of the spindle. 
An electric tool according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the locking member (35) is 
in the form of an elongate blocking tongue which is supported with positive locking by 

areas of the housing so as to prevent lateral movement and which engages by a front 
locking point (35) in the axially extended position of the locking member into recesses in 

an apron (37) connected in a rotationally fixed manner to the tool spindle (16). 
An electric tool according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the rotary knob (20) is 
used to switch a gearing cluster gear (16) [
sic
] from a first gear setting into a second gear 

setting and 
vice versa
 with the aid of eccentric setting pins (23, 26), wherein the rotary 
knob (20) has the angular setting permitting the displacement movement of the slide (32) 

in a position of the cluster gear (19) corresponding to the idling position. 
An electric tool according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the slide (32) is mounted 
pre-stressed by a spring radially outwards in the rotary knob (20) so as to lock the spindle 

and, in the angular setting of the rotary knob (20) determining the idling position, so that 
it passes into a housing recess (39) which releases the slide movement and entrains the 

locking member (35) by this movement directed radially outwards. 
An electric tool according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 for switching the gear a 
transmission disc is mounted on an inner housing (12) of a transmission module, the 

transmission disc engaging by a setting pin (23) in a groove in the cluster gear (19) for  
 

axially displacing the gear thereof and itself supporting - by means of a central bearing 
pin (25) - the rotary knob (20) in its mounting recess (31) in the outer tool housing (11) 

in order to perform a rotary setting movement, wherein the transmission disc (31) [
sic
] is 

rotated by an axially offset entrainment pin (26) which engages in an entrainment opening 
(27) in the rotary knob (20), wherein the setting pin (23) and the entrainment pin (26) 

are positioned in such a way with respect to the recess (39) of the tool housing (11) for 
the slide (32) that the cluster block (19) is in an idling position when the slide (32) is 

orientated towards the housing recess (39). 
An electric tool according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the locking member 
(35) engages with a retaining projection (34) in a receiving groove (33) in the underside 

of the slide (32), the receiving groove (33) being continued as a retaining groove (33a) in 
an annular manner in the underside of the rotary knob, wherein the receiving groove (33) 

and the retaining groove (33a) pass into each other in alignment when the slide (32) is in 
its starting position retracted against the pressure of a spring. 
An electric tool according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 an engagement point (32a) 
converging at an angle on both sides on the front edge face of the slide (32) has associated 

therewith in the two gear positions suitably complementary respective recesses 
(40a, 40b) in the housing for the switching-setting engagement.
