<ABSTRACT>
In taxi meters, it is necessary to use a buffer battery. The subject of the application serves for simplifying the outlay for the battery per se and the mounting and exchange of the buffer battery. In particular, it is proposed that there be used as a buffer battery a round cell (18) which can be mounted through an orifice provided on the front wall of the taxi meter housing (2, 3) and designated as a service compartment (14). At the same time, the round cell (18) is retained in the housing (2, 3) of the taxi meter (1) between contact-makers (25, 26), in such a way that its axis is located essentially in a position parallel to the indicating surface of the taxi meter (1).

<CLAIMS>
Taximeter having an electronic computer and data
memories, having a display device and buttons assigned to

the latter for the functional control and for calling up
memory contents and having a contact arrangement which is

accessible from the front via an opening (14) provided at
the front wall of the taximeter housing and closable by a

lead-sealable cover (15),

characterized

in that the contact arrangement (16, 37) is provided for
parametrization and diagnostic purposes,
in that a back-up battery (18) is provided, and
in that the contact arrangement (16, 37) and the back-up
battery (18) are assigned to one another in such a way that

both are accessible via the opening (14).
Taximeter according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that at least one button cell is used as the back-up
battery (18).
Taximeter according to Claim 2,

characterized

in that the button cell is held in the housing of the
taximeter (1) in such a way that its axis is situated

substantially in a parallel position with respect to the
display area.
Taximeter according to Claim 1,

characterized

in that a pack comprising a plurality of button cells,
preferably held together peripherally by means of a shrink-on

sleeve (19), is used as the back-up battery (18).
Taximeter according to Claim 4,

characterized
 
in that a dish-shaped holder (17) for the button cells is

constructed in the housing of the taximeter (1), such that
the depths of insertion of the button cells in relation to

the display area of the taximeter (1) is limited.
Taximeter according to Claim 4,

characterized

in that preferably identically designed contact springs
(25, 26) are provided for establishing contact between the

button cells and a printed circuit board (27) carrying the
electronic components of the taximeter,
in that recesses (23, 24) are provided in the housing of
the taximeter (1) on both sides of the holder (17) for the

button cells and
in that the contact springs (25, 26) fastened on the
printed circuit board (27) reach through the recesses (23,

24) and engage axially on the inserted button cells.
