<ABSTRACT>
The lock bearing (5) of a control tongue (4) of a railway switch rests on the lock element (2) by means of an extension (9) when in the closed position, i.e. when the tip of the control tongue rests on the edge (1) of the rail. As a result, the lock bearing (5) is prevented from rotating and thus the control tongue (4) which is connected to it can lift off from the edge (1) of the rail. Such a clamp lock is particularly suitable for switches of high speed routes since particularly large switch radii occur here.
