<ABSTRACT>
A demodulator responsive to a symbol containing analog signal includes a pair of relatively inexpensive analog-to-digital converters for sampling I and Q channels of the signal only once per symbol. A derotator responsive to outputs of the converters and a digital signal representing frequency and phase corrections for an input to the demodulator operates in accordance with a CORDIC function to derive I and Q channel digital signals that are compensated by the corrections. A digital phase shifter responsive to at least one of the digital I and Q signals controls when the input is sampled by the converter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
receivers and demodulators employing digital
processing responsive to symbol containing analog
signals and more particularly to such devices including
at least one of: (a) relatively inexpensive analog-to-digital
converter means for sampling the signal only
once per symbol, (b) a derotator operating in
accordance with a CORDIC function, and (c) a digital
derotator for deriving a digital signal representing
frequency and phase corrections for an input to the
demodulator in combination with a digital phase shifter
for controlling when the input is sampled by an analog-to-digital
converter.Reference will now be made to Fig. 1 of the
accompanying drawings which is a block schematic diagram
of a previously proposed phase shift key receiver and
demodulator employing digital processing. The receiver
of Fig. 1 is responsive to a noise laden suppressed
carrier quadrature phase shift key (QPSK) modulated
electromagnetic wave incident on antenna 10. The wave
incident on antenna 10 is transduced into an electrical
signal that is amplified by RF and IF stages 12. The
wave has a precisely controlled carrier frequency
determined at an electromagnetic wave QPSK transmitter
and includes symbols having a predetermined rate, i.e.,
frequency, e.g., 20 mHz.The output signal of stages 12 is applied in 
parallel to mixers 14 and 16, also respectively
responsive to mutually orthogonal oscillations derived
by ± 45° phase shifters 18 and 20. Phase shifters 18
and 20 are in turn responsive to voltage controlled
variable frequency local oscillator 22, having an
output frequency approximately equal to the suppressed
carrier frequency derived from stages 12. The
resulting outputs of mixers 18 and 20 are respectively
applied to matched (to the transmitter waveform) low-pass
filters 24 and 26 which derive variable analog
baseband signals representing symbols to be processed
into intelligence representing output signals. The
baseband output signals of filters 24 and 26 are
typically referred to as I and Q channel signals.The I and Q channel signals derived by filters 24
and 26 are respectively applied via variable gain
amplifiers 23 and 25 to analog-to-digital converters 28
and 30, operated to sample the baseband I and Q signal
amplitudes at a variable frequency, typically
approximately twice the symbol frequency. The gains of
amplifiers 23 and 25 are controlled so that the maximum
amplitude of the analog signals supplied to converters
28 and 30 equals the optimal range which the
converters
