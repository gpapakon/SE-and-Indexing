<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) has a multi-component injection head (8) to which are connected elastomer extruders (9, 10), an introduction device (21) for a composite material and a plastic extruder (2) via a calibration and cooling zone (5). From an outlet (15) of the multi-component injection head emerges a profiled section of composite chemically bonded thermoplastic synthetic materials and elastomers. Said section is co-vulcanised in a downstream cross-linking zone (17).
