<ABSTRACT>
With this invention it is possible to reconstruct aging hydraulically driven elevator systems at little cost in such a way that the risk of environmental pollution and/or groundwater contamination can be eliminated. Instead of a conventional hydraulic oil, a biodegradable vegetable oil (bio-oil) is used and at the same time the natural degradation process of the bio-oil is prevented or at least delayed by contact of the bio-oil with the oxygen in the air being largely prevented by a closed hydraulic system. Instead of an open reservoir, a reservoir (10) sealed gas-tight is used, the free space of the reservoir (10) being filled with a neutral gas which, during the hoisting movements of the elevator, is forced into or drawn off from a gas accumulator (18), advantageously designed as a gas bag. In addition, this gas bag prevents air pollution during operation of the elevator by the otherwise normal discharge of foul-smelling air.
