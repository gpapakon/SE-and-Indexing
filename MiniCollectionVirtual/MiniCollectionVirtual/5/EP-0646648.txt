<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing
polypeptides.As a method for producing polypeptide in the cell-free
translation system, there has been known a method which required
ribosomes, chemical energy sources such as ATP and GTP, and
soluble protein factors.However, the method was not always satisfactory in that
the method required energy sources and soluble protein factors.
Therefore, the conventional method was so complicated that it was
not practical for producing polypeptide.Other methods for producing polypeptides are described in US Patent No. 4,440,676
disclosing a process for the production of a dipeptide, a polypeptide or a protein
whereby an end amino group and an end carboxyl group are directly combined using
pentaco-ordinate spirophosphorane as a coupling agent to form a peptide linkage.
WO 88/08453 discloses a cell-free translation system on ribosomes containing as
substrates ATP, GTP and amino acids. As the substrates are consumed and the
products being the translation products as well as AMP, GDP, pyrophosphate and
inorganic phosphate are obtained the products are extracted while the substrates are
simultaneously introduced into the system.Under the circumstances, the present inventors have
intensively studied the method for producing polypeptides in the
cell-free translation system, and have found that the condensation
of a precursor comprising amino acids and adaptors can be
effectively performed in the absence of the energy source such as
ATP and GTP, and soluble protein factors but in the presence of
rRNAs and an aromatic tertiary amine other than GTP or ATP. Thus, the present invention provides a method for
producing a polypeptide, which comprises condensing precursors
comprising an amino acid and an adaptor in the absence of soluble protein factors, GTP and ATP in the presence of
rRNAs,
and an aromatic tertiary amine other than GTP or ATP.It also provides a method for producing a polypeptide,
which comprises the steps of;
(a) reacting an amino acid with an adaptor molecule in the presence
of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to obtain a precursor comprising an
amino acid and a nucleic acid adaptor; and(b) condensing the precursors in the absence of soluble protein factors, GTP and ATP in the presence of rRNAs,
and in the
presence of an aromatic tertiary amine other than GTP or ATP.According to the present invention, the condensation of
precursors comprising an amino acid and an adaptor can be
effectively carried out without energy source such as ATP and GTP
and soluble
