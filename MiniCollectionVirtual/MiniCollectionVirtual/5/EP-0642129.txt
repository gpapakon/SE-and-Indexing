<ABSTRACT>
In a transmission system only part of the signal samples of series of 
transmit signal samples is transmitted by the transmitter (2) to a receiver (6) over a 

channel (4). In addition, a number of characteristic parameters of the series of signal 
samples are determined in the transmitter by characterization means (12) and transmitted 

to the receiver. 
The characteristic parameters are used at the receiver end (6) for 
reconstructing the missing signal samples. This is effected by assignin  g to the missing 

signal samples a value, so that the series of signal samples is described in the best way 

possible by the characteristic parameters. 
It appears that if periodicities having a period longer than the time 
duration of the series of signal samples occur, the reconstruction of the signal samples 

is accompanied by a considerable interpolation error. By determining this period in the 
transmitter (2), transmitting same over the channel (4) to the receiver (6) and 

introducing this periodicity in the receiver (6) by period introducing means (18) in the 
reconstructed sequence of signal samples, the interpolation error may be reduced 

considerably.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transmission system for sequentially transmitting
signal samples, comprising a transmitter which includes characterization means for
determining parameters characteristic of the signal samples, means for transmitting the
characteristic parameters and at least part of the signal samples over a channel to a
receiver, which receiver includes interpolation means for determining the value of
missing signal samples to obtain successive series of signal samples having characteristic
parameters that correspond to the received characteristic parameters.In addition, the invention relates to a transmitter, a receiver, a coder and a
decoder to be used in such a transmission system, as well as an interpolator and an
interpolation method.A transmission system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from
United States Patent 5,025,404.Such transmission systems are used, for example, for transferring speech or
musical signals over channels having a limited transmission capacity or over channels on
which so-called burst errors occur.A first example of such a channel is a radio channel between a mobile
station and a fixed base station. The available transmission capacity of this channel is
limited, because this channel is utilized by a great number of users. Besides, there may be
periods in which, as a result of fading, the probability of the occurrence of burst errors is
rather great.A second example is a recording channel which utilizes a magnetic, optical
or other recording medium such as, for example, a ROM. The capacity thereof is mostly
limited, and in some of these recording media burst errors may occur when the recorded
samples are reproduced.In the transmitter of prior-art transmission system, characteristic parameters
are determined of the signal samples to be transferred. This may be effected by
determining linear prediction parameters which describe the relation between current
signal samples and previous signal samples, while these parameters are determined in
such a way that an error between the current signal sample estimated on the basis of the 
previous signal samples and the real value of the current signal sample is minimized.
These characteristic parameters are transferred to the receiver over the channel together
with (part of) the signal samples.If a saving on transmission capacity is desired, only part of the signal
samples are transferred over the channel. The samples that have not been transferred are
determined on the basis of the received characteristic
