Non-acoustic alarm intended to equip a device 
supplying information such as time information, including 

motor means (24) which can be electrically driven and 
which are associated with a mass (26) adapted to be set in 

motion under the action of the motor means (24) in order 
to furnish a vibratory effect, characterized in that the 

motor means (24) are constituted by an electromagnetic 
motor including a winding (24b) and a core (24a) 

supporting such winding, such motor (24a, 24b) being 
fixedly mounted on a support (28) including elastic 

coupling elements (30) which are associated with said mass 
(26), in that said core (24a) of the motor and said mass 

(2) are substantially situated in a same plane (Pd) and in 
that said core (24a), said mass (26) and said elastic 

coupling elements (30) are designed and arranged so that 
said mass (26) assumes a quasi-linear oscillating motion 

in this plane (Pd) when the motor is operated. 
Alarm according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said support (28) is a single multifunctional piece having 

the form of a stirrup including a fixed portion (28a) on 
which said motor (24) is mounted and a movable portion 

(28b) on which said mass (26) is mounted, the two 
respectively fixed (28a) and movable (28b) portions being 

coupled together by the elastic coupling elements (30) 
which are constituted by bent blades integral with said 

fixed (28a) and movable (28b) portions. 
Alarm according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that said said core (24a) of the electromagnetic motor 

(24a, 24b) includes two arms (32) which extend parallel to 
the elastic coupling elements (30) of the support (28) and 

which form two pole pieces intended to constitute a gap 
(e) with corresponding surfaces (38) of the mass (26).  

 
Alarm according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the mass (26) is a piece of basically 

planar form extending over the entire width of the core 
(24a) and ofa height substantially equal to that of the 

motor. 
Alarm according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the support (28), the core 

(24a) and the mass (26) are constituted by stamped parts. 
Alarm according to claim 5, characterized in that 
the core (24a) and the mass (26) are welded to the support 

(28). 
Alarm according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the support (28) is formed in a metallic sheet.
