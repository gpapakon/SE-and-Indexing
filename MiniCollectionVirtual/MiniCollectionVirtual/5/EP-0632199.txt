<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the activation of an ignition coil, it is proposed, in order to transmit additional data for controlling the ignition energy between control module and ignition output stage over a time range of no significance for the ignition, that an additional control pulse (E) be transmitted between two ignition pulses (N2, N3).

Method of varying the ignition energy of an ignition coil with a connected current
monitoring, in which ignition pulses from a control apparatus are transmitted to an ignition

end stage, characterised in that additional control pulses (E) are inserted between two
ignition pulses produced by the control apparatus and that in dependence on this

additional control pulse (E) and ignition current limiter is switched over to a predetermined
increased value of the ignition current for the ignition coil or the burn period of the spark

plug is influenced.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the ignition end stage (2)
converts the additional control pulse (E) and the associated ignition pulse (N3) into a

single pulse (N3').
Method according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the maximum size
of the ignition current and/or the burn period is determined by the lead time of the rising

flank of the additional control pulse (E) relative to the normal ignition pulse (N3).
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the burn period
and/or the size of the ignition current is determined by the width of the additional control

pulse (E).
Method according to claim 2, characterised in that due to the shortness of the
additional control pulse (E) it is established by the pulse of a monoflop (5) that that is not a

normal ignition pulse and consequently an ignition process is not triggered.
Circuit arrangement for carrying out the method according to claim 1, characterised
in that a control apparatus (1), which contains engine characterising figures such as

temperature and crankshaft angle as input magnitudes, inserts an additional control signal
(E), which is derived therefrom, between two ignition pulses and passes it to an ignition

end stage (2), the rising flank of which additional control signal acts on a monoflop (5), the
pulse of which together with the control signal are passed to both an AND member (7) and

an OR member (6), the output of which serves as a signal for charging the coil and for
resetting a flipflop (8) which, set by the AND member (7), gives the signal for increasing

the ignition current. 
Circuit arrangement according to claim 6, characterised in that the signal "increase
ignition current" serves, by means of a switch (S1), for increasing the input voltage of a

first operational amplifier (OP1), which by way of a further operational amplifier (OP2),
which is connected as an integrator, increases the ignition current in the ignition coil (3) in

such a manner that by way of a voltage leaper and a power transistor (TR) the current in
the primary winding of the ignition coil (3) rises, and that the output of the OR stage (6)

"charge coil" is connected to a semiconductor switch (S2) at the input of the third
operational amplifier (OP3) for as long as the ignition coil (3) is to be charged.
