<ABSTRACT>
A quenching device with thin pads, to cool by contact the cast 
blanks in continuous casting plants, comprises thin self-adjusting pads, 

essentially consisting of a thin wall (7, 7A) combined with cooling ducts 
(8, 8A) which adhere to the inner surface of said wall (7, 7A), and fluid 

pressure means (6, 6A) associated to said pads in order to cause the 
outer surface of their thin wall (7, 7A) to adhere to the cast blank (G).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns important improvements in continuous 
casting plants and it relates, in particular, to a quenching device comprising 
thin pads to cool by contact the cast blanks in said plants. The continuous metal casting plants are known to comprise quenching 
systems to carry out the cooling by contact of the cast blanks (bars, 
billets, slabs). Such systems make use of devices which cause sliding 
and/or oscillating pads - provided with grooves into which circulates a 
cooling fluid (generally water) - to adhere onto said blanks. In various respects, said systems are no doubt preferable - as far 
as efficiency and conduction of the process - to the more traditional 
spray quenching systems, or to the systems using mixed air-water jets; 
however, so far, such systems have suffered from the serious drawback of 
adopting quenching devices which make use of very heavy and thick cooling 
pads (independently from the various metallic or refractory materials 
from which they are made). For this reason, the movement of such pads has 
always been difficult to control and has required the use of very stout, 
bulky and complicated devices, which have turned out to be scarcely flexible 
and very costly. Above all, however, the cooling pads of the known 
quenching systems have difficulties in adhering and conforming to the 
surface of the cast blanks just on account of their considerable thickness 
and scarce mobility, thereby limiting the efficiency and uniformity 
of the quenching action as well as the possibility to regulate the same. An interesting attempt has been made to overcome this last obstacle 
by creating a device equipped with pads which, though still being heavy 
and very thick, are apt to conform to the surface of the cast blanks far 
better than the conventional pads. In fact - in addition to the usual 
heavy and thick molten or forged body, provided with grooves for the 
cooling fluid - said pads comprise, in correspondence of the active part 
of said body, a thin sheet-metal lining which has its outer surface in  
 
contact with the blank to be cooled and which closes, with its inner 
surface, the open side of said grooves, thereby being directly hit by the 
cooling fluid circulating therein. The use of said lining - which perfectly conforms to the surface of 
the cast blank, thanks to its scarce thickness - requires however the 
presence of sealing gaskets for the cooling fluid in correspondence of 
the active parts of the pad, between the periphery of said lining and its 
molte

<CLAIMS>
Quenching device with thin pads to cool by contact the cast 
blanks in continuous casting plants, characterized in that it comprises 

thin self-adjusting pads, essentially consisting of a thin wall combined 
with cooling ducts which adhere to the inner surface of said wall, and 

fluid pressure means associated to said pads in order to cause the outer 
surface of their thin wall to adhere to the cast blank. 
Device as in claim 1), wherein the cooling ducts of the pads are 
independent from said thin wall and are pressed in contact with its inner 

surface by a hollow yielding structure under pressure, which also forms 
said pressure means. 
Device as in claim 1), wherein the cooling ducts of the pads are 
in one piece with said thin wall, being formed by way of weld lines between 

the wall itself and a thin fellow wall associated thereto, onto 
which act said pressure means. 
Device as in claim 1), wherein said pressure means consist of 
bladders of elastic material. 
Device as in claim 1), wherein a single pressure fluid feeds 
said pressure means and flows through said cooling ducts.
