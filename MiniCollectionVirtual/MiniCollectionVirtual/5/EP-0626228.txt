<ABSTRACT>
A method of modifying the surface of a workpiece (2) 
which is to be joined to another member. The method 

comprises exposing a series of locations on the workpiece 
surface to a power beam (1) whereby at each location 

workpiece material (4) is melted and spaced laterally under 
the influence of the power beam and then allowed to 

solidify so as to form a cavity (3) surrounded by an area 
of solidified material which is raised with respect to the 

workpiece surface and has a re-entrant profile.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to modifying or preparing the 
surface topography of a workpiece or parent material in 
order to increase the degree of mechanical friction or the 
degree of mechanical interlock with respect to another 
material or body. Various methods have been used to increase the surface 
roughness of materials which have been made relatively 
smooth by machining, polishing, forming against a flat 
mould and so forth. These roughening methods include 
surface deformation by mechanical means such as grooving or 
knurling, or chemical means such as etching. Alternatively, material has been added to the parent 
material surface by means, for example, of arc welding with 
a consumable filler wire. In one example small drops of 
metal have been deposited onto a metal surface, utilising 
the consumable electrode gas metal arc (GMA) process in 
which the current is modulated such that molten drops are 
detached from the melting wire electrode in a discrete and 
regular manner. These drops serve as raised dimples on the 
otherwise relatively smooth parent material surface and 
have been used to reduce the tendency to slip between the 
parent and another body. In accordance with the present invention, a method of 
modifying the surface of a workpiece which is to be joined 
to another member comprises exposing a series of locations 
on the workpiece surface to a power beam whereby at each 
location workpiece material is melted and spaced laterally 
under the influence of the power beam and then allowed to 
solidify so as to form a cavity surrounded by an area of 
solidified material which is raised with respect to the 
adjacent workpiece surface and has a re-entrant profile. Thus, suitable raised portions or dimples with re-entrant 
profiles are generated on the otherwise 
comparatively smooth material surface from the parent 
material by rapidly smelting small localised regions by  
 
means of a (typically focused) power beam such as an 
electron beam impinging on the parent material. The high 
power density beam is rapidly moved from point to point to 
produce a series of such raised dimples. By closely 
spacing the dimples a semi-continuous line or ridge can be 
produced. It is noted that the raised material comes from 
melting and displacing the molten material, thus leaving a 
small cavity in the parent. Some material may be lost by 
vaporisation under the high power density of the applied 
beam. In use, when the workpiece is adhered to another 
member, both the cavity and the raised dimple can 
co
