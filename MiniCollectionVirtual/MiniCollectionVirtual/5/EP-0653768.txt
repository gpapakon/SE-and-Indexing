the fact that the light sources are formed by small fi
lament lamps. 
A keypad according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized by 
the fact that the plate (400) is provided with a roof-shaped prism 

(412, 414) on its periphery. 
A keypad according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterized by 
the fact that the plate (400) is provided with protecting lugs (460) 

on its periphery, and adapted to engage with complementary snap-fastening 
teeth (160) provided on the housing (100). 
A keypad according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterized by 
the fact that the plate (400) possesses through openings (426)
