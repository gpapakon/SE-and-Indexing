<ABSTRACT>
To excavate sticky soil such as clayey soil, left 
and right buckets (39, 40) are slightly inclined, 

thereby reducing the force to pull the buckets (39, 40) 
from a hole. A structure and a hydraulic control 

circuit of a clamshell bucket (22) includes left and 
right buckets (39, 40) which are closable, thereby 

holding soil, and a hydraulic cylinder (49) having a 
stroke reserve so as to be further extendible after the 

buckets (39, 40) are closed, whereby the closed buckets 
(39, 40) can be displaced sidewardly relative to the 

vertical.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clamshell bucket 
arrangement for deeply excavating the earth to form a 
hole having a depth which is too long for its diameter, 
and particularly to a structure of the clamshell bucket 
and a hydraulic control circuit thereof capable of 
reducing pull up force of the bucket when excavating 
sticky earth such as claylike soil. There have been many cases at a construction site, 
building site, etc. where the earth should be deeply 
excavated to form a hole having a depth which is too 
long for its diameter. For example, there have been 
cases for excavating the earth to form a hole in which 
an anchor supporting a steel tower is embedded, a hole 
in which a water purifier tank is embedded, a hole for 
ground-making and a hole for well sinking. In such 
cases, the hole should generally have a depth which is 
too long (e.g. ranging from 15m to 20m) for its diameter 
(e.g. about 5m). In deep excavating work, a construction machine is 
conventionally employed having a stretchable arm fixed 
to a boom wherein a clamshell bucket arrangement is  
 
coupled to a tip end of a top arm of the stretchable arm 
and is suspended vertically by the weight thereof. In 
this construction machine, the clamshell bucket is first 
hung to reach the bottom of the hole so as to bite into 
the sand and it closes after holding the sand. The 
clamshell bucket is successively pulled upward from the 
hole while it is closed and then it is opened over the 
ground or a truck bed, thereby transferring the held 
sand. If the operations are repeated, it is possible to 
excavate the earth deeper to form a deeper hole. Such conventional clamshell bucket arrangement 
comprises a support shaft which forms a main frame 
thereof and is suspended from the top arm, two buckets 
supported by both sides of the lower end of the support 
shaft so as to be closable to the left and right, and 
teeth fixed to both sides of each bucket at the portion 
where these buckets confront each other. In such an 
arrangement, the sand can be held when the buckets 
supported by the support shaft are closed, and it can be 
dropped when the buckets are opened. The structure of 
this clamshell bucket is well known and is employed on 
construction machines when excavating soft ground. In such a clamshell bucket arrangement, it is 
possible to easily excavate the earth by closing the 
buckets on soft earth which is not sticky such as a 
sandy soil, thereby increasing the working efficiency. 
However, in ground such as claylike (i.e. clayey)

<CLAIMS>
An actuating mechanism for a clamshell bucket (22) 
comprising a support shaft (38), left and right buckets (39, 

40) pivotally connected at opposite sides of one end of the 
support shaft (38), a respective hydraulic cylinder (48, 49) 

connected between the support shaft (38) and each bucket 
(39, 40), whereby the buckets (39, 40) can be closed 

together to hold soil therein by extending the pistons (68, 
69) of the hydraulic cylinders (48, 49) and the buckets can 

be opened to release the soil by contracting the pistons 
(68, 69); 

   characterized in that the piston (69) of one 
hydraulic cylinder (49) has a stroke reserve so as to be 

further extendable when the piston (68) of the other 
hydraulic cylinder (48) is fully extended, so that the 

closed left and right buckets (39, 40) are then pivoted 
sideways relative to the support shaft. 
A mechanism according to claim 1, wherein the 
arrangement is such that the buckets are closed together 

when the piston (68) of the other hydraulic cylinder (48) is 
fully extended, and wherein the further extension of the 

piston (69) of the one hydraulic cylinder (49) which acts to 
displace the left and right buckets (39, 40) sideways, also 

causes the piston (68) of the other hydraulic cylinder (48) 
to be contracted. 
A mechanism according to claim 1 or claim 2 in 
which the support shaft (38) is suspended substantially 

vertically from the upper end of a top arm, and in which the 
buckets (39, 40) are of substantially partial-circular shape 

in cross section, and each have a plurality of teeth at 
their contacting portions, each hydraulic cylinder (48, 49) 

being connected between the upper end of the support shaft 
(38) and the rear surface of its respective bucket (39, 40). 
A mechanism according to any preceding claim further 
comprising a hydraulic control circuit which is 

 
characterized in that the pressure chambers (66, 67) of the 

hydraulic cylinders (48, 49) are commonly connected to an 
oil supply passage (a) through oil supply passages (b, d, c) 

while discharge chambers (70, 71) of the hydraulic cylinders 
(48, 49) are commonly connected to an oil return passage (g) 

through oil return passages (e, f), and a directional 
control valve (65) is associated with the oil supply 

passages (b, d) between the oil supply passage (a) and the 
hydraulic cylinder (48) so as to disconnect the hydraulic 

cylinder (48) from the oil supply passage (a) when hydraulic 
pressure of the oil in the oil supply passage (b) is 

increased. 
A mechanism having a hydraulic control circuit 
according to claim 4, wherein the directional control valve 

(65) is switched when hydraulic pressure of the oil in the 
oil supply passage (b) is increased to disconnect the 

hydraulic cylinder (48) from the oil supply passage (b) and 
to connect the hydraulic cylinder (48) to an oil return 

passage (h). 
A mechanism having a hydraulic control circuit 
according to claim 4 or claim 5, further including a 

directional control valve (72) which is disposed between the 
hydraulic cylinders (48, 49) and the oil return passage (g) 

and is switched to disconnect hydraulic cylinders (48, 49) 
from the oil return passage (g) when hydraulic pressure of 

the oil under pressure in the oil supply passage (b) is 
increased.
