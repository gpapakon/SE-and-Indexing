<ABSTRACT>
A clinch type staple (22) has a U-shaped configuration 
with a pair of legs (26, 28) extending generally 

perpendicularly from a base portion (24) of the staple with 
the outside surface of the distal ends (30, 32) of the legs 

being bevelled. The legs of the staple lie in spaced apart 
planes that are parallel to one another, but are angularly 

offset from one another in order to insure that the legs 
(26, 28) will not contact or interfere with each other as 

they are clinched into a workpiece (34, 36). A plurality of 
such clinch staples (22) can be manufactured into an assembly 

(20) of clinch staples. The method of making such an 
assembly of clinch staples includes advancing a plurality 

of wires (42) in parallel side-by-side relation in a flat, 
planar array and adhering them to one another. A blank 

(54), severed from an end of the formed array, includes a 
plurality of side-by-side wire segments of equal length extending 

parallel to one another in a first direction. The 
severing of the wires is accomplished along a cutting line 

that is inclined by a bias angle (56) from a perpendicular 
to the first direction. The blank (54) is bent along two 

bending lines to form a channel-shaped stick of clinch 
staples with the legs (26, 28) extending perpendicularly 

from a base or bight portion (24) of the staples (22). The 
two bending lines are parallel to the cutting line so that 

the legs of the formed staples will be offset angularly 
from each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for installing
staples from a staple assembly as specified in the
pre-characterizing clause of claim 1.US-A-5 035 040 discloses a way of installing hog ring
type fasteners around a wire or rod as, e.g., to attach upholstery
material. In contrast thereto clinch staples may be used
to fasten two or more workpieces together, one on top of the
other, for example two strips of wood. In doing so, the legs
of each of the staples are driven through the workpieces with
the ends of the legs turned back or clinched into at least the
lowest of the workpieces upon striking a flat metal anvil
situated below. In order for the staple legs to be deflected
inwardly or toward each other as they are driven into the
workpieces, the outside surfaces of the distal ends of the
legs are beveled. However, some provision must be made to assure
that the legs are separated from one another as they are
so deflected since, otherwise, they will contact or interfere
with each other as they are being driven back into the workpieces
after contacting the anvil. While oppositely directed,
saw-toothed configured ends of the legs of clinch staples tend
to insure that the legs will not interfere with each other as
they are being clinched into workpieces, such staples cannot
be readily and economically manufactured.Quite generally, a staple is a formed wire fastener
having a generally U-shape configuration with parallel legs
projecting perpendicularly from each end of a base or bight
portion of the staple. In so far such staples could be economically
fabricated and formed into assemblies of staples by
means of automated manufacturing and packaging equipment. The
staples that are the most economical to manufacture are those
having points at the end of each leg that are formed by bevelling 
the end of the legs along planes perpendicular to the
plane in which the base and legs of the staple lie. These
points at the end of the staple legs are typically referred to
as "C" points (a modified version of a "C" point - sometimes
referred to as a "CO" point - results when only the outside
surface of the end of the staple leg is beveled). However,
problems occur when conventional clinch type staples having
this type of modified "C" point or "CO" point are installed
because the legs of the staples tend to contact or interfere
with each other as the staples are being clinched into the
workpieces. Staples can also be provided with offset points
beveled in the transverse direction (typically referred to as
a "D"

<CLAIMS>
A method for installing staples (22) from a
staple assembly (20), said staple assembly including a

plurality of such staples adhered together with each staple
having a base portion (24) and first and second legs (26, 28)

extending perpendicularly from said base portion yet offset at
an offset angle (41) with respect to each other, the first

legs (26) of the staples of said staple assembly (20) and the
second legs (28) of the staples of said staple assembly lying

in planes generally parallel to each other and each of said
first staple legs (26) having a first bevel along the outside

of its distal end (30) and each of said second staple legs
(28) having a second bevel along the outside of its distal end

(32),

   said method comprising removing said staples (22)
from said staple assembly (20) one at a time for installation

and being 
characterized
 in that it is performed employing said
staples (22) as clinch staples for fastening together

workpieces (34, 36) one on top of the other and, to this end,
comprises the following additional steps:


placing said workpieces (34, 36) on an anvil (40)
and
driving said removed staples (22), one at a time,
into said workpieces (34, 36) by driving said first and second

staple legs (26, 28) through said workpieces until their
distal ends (30, 32) contact said anvil (40) and further until

said base portion (24) of the respective staple gets rested on
the top one (34) of said workpieces, 
whereby said bevels cause said distal ends (30, 32)
of said staple legs (26, 28) to be deflected towards each

other and back into at least the lowest one (36) of said
workpieces with said staple legs crossing each other without

contacting each other due to said offset.
The method of claim 1, 
characterized
 in that
said offset angle (41) of said staples (22) employed is

between about 1 degree and about 5 degrees, and preferably
about 2 degrees.
