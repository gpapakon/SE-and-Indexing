<ABSTRACT>
The pump has a rotor (18) riding on a shaft 
end (12-3) and is eccentric with respect to the 

rotational axis of the shaft (12). The rotor (18) 
rotates in a bore (16-2) of a pivot ring (16) and coacts 

therewith in the nature of a double action pump such 
that there are two pumping cycles per revolution of the 

shaft (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
Fluid machines such as compressors are typically
lubricated by oil drawn from a sump by a pumping structure
associated with the crankshaft. Centrifugal pumps and
positive displacement pumps such as gerotors are commonly
used to pump the oil. One problem associated with some
rotary compressors such as scroll compressors is that they
can run in reverse due to miswiring or due to a pressure
equalization across the compressor upon shut down. Under
these conditions some types of oil pumps do not function
properly and damage can result from lack of adequate
lubrication. Those oil pumps that do function properly
under reverse rotation conditions are, typically,
relatively complicated and costly.A positive displacement pump as defined in the
precharacterizing portion of independent claim 1 is
disclosed in US-A-2,260,868 which concerns a combined
lubricating oil supply pump and air pump for supplying air
to a fluid operated wiper motor. A similar pump is also
disclosed in US-A-2,260,867. When the direction of rotation
changes the fluid flow direction through the pumps
disclosed in US-A-2,260,868 and US-A-2,260,867 reverses.It is an object of this invention to provide a
positive displacement oil pump having few parts, low cost
and high reliability, suitable for horizontal and vertical
orientation, and which pumps fluid in one direction
independent of the direction of shaft rotation.To achieve this there is provided in accordance
with the invention a positive displacement pump for a fluid
machine having an oil supply comprising a shaft having a
rotational axis; oil supply and distribution means; rotor
means drivingly received on said shaft and located
eccentrically with respect to said rotational axis; means
defining a cylinder having a bore defined by a pair of
semicircular portions joined by straight sections
corresponding in extent to a distance by which said rotor
means is located eccentrically with respect to said
rotational axis, said bore receiving said rotor means and 
coacting therewith to define at least one trapped volume;
oil passage means in said rotor means coacting with said
oil supply and distribution means to supply cil from said
oil supply to said trapped volume during a suction stroke
and from said trapped volume to said oil distribution means
during a discharge stroke; characterized in that said oil
supply and distribution means are formed in said shaft, and
said shaft has a limited relative rotational movement with
respect to said rotor means and said means for supplying
oil and said means for
