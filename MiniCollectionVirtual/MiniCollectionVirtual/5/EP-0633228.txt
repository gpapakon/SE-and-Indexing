<ABSTRACT>
A method of making glass articles, wherein glass 
flows from a furnace, through a distribution channel, and 

then to forming means, the method comprising forming at least 
one oxy/fuel flame at the sides of the distribution channel, 

the flame having a hottest point within about five inches of 
the base of the flame so as to produce a large thermal 

gradient between the sides of the distribution channel and 
the center of the distribution channel. A novel distribution 

channel and a method and apparatus for producing an oxy/fuel 
flame having a hottest point within about five inches of the 

base of the flame are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of glass
making using an oxy/fuel fired distribution channel.In the production of glass, a distribution channel has
two main purposes. First, the distribution channel
delivers molten glass from the furnace to the forming
means. Second, the distribution channel modifies the
temperature of the molten glass. Usually, the temperature
of the molten glass must be lowered.Modifying the temperature of the molten glass brings
the glass to a viscosity required for forming. Viscosity
requirements vary widely depending on the glass and forming
means used. Uniformity of temperature for all glass
entering the forming means is the measure of excellence.
Uniformity of gob weight or product dimensions are
dependent upon uniform temperatures in the gob.However, modifying the temperature of molten glass in
a distribution channel is difficult due to temperature
differences existing in the glass. The glass at the sides
of the distribution channel is cooler than the glass in the
center of the distribution channel. This is because the
glass at the sides of the channel transfers heat through
the walls of the channel, while the glass in the center of
the channel is insulated from heat loss by the surrounding
glass.Thus, it is usually necessary to heat the glass at the
sides of the distribution channel so as to raise its
temperature to that of the glass in the center of the
channel. Conversely, the glass in the center of the
distribution channel is usually simultaneously cooled so as
to lower its temperature to that of the glass at the sides
of the channel.The temperature of the glass at the sides of the
distribution channel is commonly raised with burners. 
Recently, a few glassmakers have tried oxy/fuel burners in
place of air/fuel burners. Attention is directed to EP-A-167447
and EP-A-216698, both of which describes the use of
any oxy/fuel flame to heat molten glass flowing in a
forehearth or distribution channel. Compared with air/fuel
burners, oxy/fuel burners provide three times the available
heat from the same fuel input and a significant reduction
in NOx.One major problem has historically plagued the
practice of heating the glass at the sides of a
distribution channel with burners. The heat produced by
the burners travels to the center of the channel. This
heats the glass in the center of the channel, which should
be cooled.To deal with this problem, wind cooling of the center
of the distribution channel and "wings" substantially
separating the center and sides of the channel

A method of producing glass articles, wherein molten
glass flows from a furnace, through a distribution channel,

and then to forming means, said method includes forming by
means of any oxy/fuel burner, at least one oxy/fuel flame

(33) directed from the sides of said distribution channel
towards the center thereof, said flame having a hottest

point within 127mm (five inches) of the face or outermost
part of said burner so as to produce a large thermal

gradient between the sides of said distribution channel and
the center of said distribution channel.
The method of claim 1, wherein said at least one
oxy/fuel flame (33) has a hottest point within 76mm (three

inches) of the said face or outermost part of the burner.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein said burner
provides between 14 l/hr (0.5 SCFH) and 425 l/hr (15 SCFH)

of fuel.
The method of claim 3, wherein said burner provides

The method of any preceding claim, including cooling
the center of said distribution channel with a longitudinal

flow of air.
The method of any preceding claim, including
separating the sides of said distribution channel from the

center of said distribution channel by placing wings (27)
