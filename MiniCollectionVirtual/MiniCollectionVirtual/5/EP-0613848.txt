<ABSTRACT>
A dispensing assembly (10) adapted to be mounted on a 
backboard (12) of the type that can be supported on an easel (13) 

or other support structure for dispensing lengths of 
sheet material (14,94,104)(e.g., paper) from a roll (18,98,108) of sheet 

material included in the dispensing assembly (10). The 
sheet material (14,94,104) has strips of repositionable pressure 

sensitive adhesive (20,99,109) coated on its rear surface (16) by which 
the dispensed sheet material (14,94,104) can, for example, first be 

removably adhered to the backboard (12) adjacent the 
dispensing assembly (10) while still attached to the sheet 

material on the roll (18,98,108) to afford writing on the dispensed 
sheet material (14,94,104), and may subsequently be separated from 

the sheet material on the roll (18,98,108), removed from the 
backboard (12), and removably adhered to another support 

surface to display the written material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to large sheet 
material that can be supported at the front of a room 
on a support such as an easel during a meeting and used 
to record lists of items or ideas generated during the 
meeting, and in one aspect to the packaging of such 
sheet material. Many large pad assemblies are known that include a 
multiplicity of aligned flexible sheets (i.e., 
typically paper sheets) in a stack which are attached 
together along or adjacent aligned edges of the sheets, 
and include a stiff back card on which the stack is 
mounted so that the pad assembly can be supported at 
the front of a room on a support such as a presentation 
easel during a meeting and used to record lists of 
items or ideas generated during the meeting. During 
such use, typically one or more of the uppermost sheets 
on the pad, after being written on, are either (1) bent 
or pivoted away from an underlying sheet so that they 
project over and are supported on an upper support edge 
of the back card and the underlying sheet can be 
written on, or (2) are separated from the stack so that 
the separated sheet or sheets can be positioned 
elsewhere, typically on the walls of the room to which 
they are attached by means such as a clip, pin or a 
length of adhesive coated tape so that information on 
the separated sheets can easily be viewed by the 
participants of the meeting. A pad assembly commercially designated "Clingers" 
and available from the Ampad Corporation, Holyoke, 
Maryland, comprises a multiplicity of flexible sheets 
disposed in a stack with the corresponding edges of the 
sheets aligned and with each sheet having a band of 
repositionable pressure sensitive adhesive coated on  
 
its rear surface along aligned first edges of the 
sheets, and the band of repositionable pressure 
sensitive adhesive on each sheet adhering it to the 
front surface of the adjacent sheet in the stack. 
Sheets removed from the "Clingers" pad assembly can be 
releasably adhered to a support surface by the bands of 
repositionable pressure sensitive adhesive on the 
sheets. U.S. Patent No. 5,153,041 discloses a pad assembly 
including a multiplicity of aligned flexible sheets 
attached together along one edge portion to form a 
stack from which any of several uppermost individual 
sheets can either be pivoted away from an adjacent 
sheet, or can be separated from the stack and 
releasably adhered to a support surface by 
repositionable pressure sensitive on the sheet that can 
adhere well to many rough surfaces; which pad
