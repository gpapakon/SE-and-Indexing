<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for determining leaks in assemblies (8) having a device (2) for feeding gas through the assembly (8) to be investigated, a camera (14) having a narrow-band filter characteristic essentially matched to the spectral absorption of the gas, and a device (16, 18), connected to the camera (14), for processing and indicating the image picked up from the assembly (8) to be investigated.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for detecting leaks in components (8), having a
device (2) for passing gas through the component (8) to be

inspected, a device (10) for irradiating the component (8) to be
inspected with infrared radiation, a camera (14) having a narrowband

filter characteristic substantially matched to the spectral
absorption of the gas, and a device (16, 18) connected to the

camera (14) and intended for processing and displaying the
picked-up image of the component (8) to be inspected,

characterized in that the gas is CO
2
.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
gas pass-through device (2) includes a flowmeter (4).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the gas pass-through device (2) passes the CO
2
 under pressure
through the component (8) to be inspected.
Apparatus according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the component (8) to be inspected and the

camera (14) are movable relative to one another.
