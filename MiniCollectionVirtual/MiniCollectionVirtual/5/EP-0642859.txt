<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cutting tool for drilling in the solid and for turning, having a rhombic or rhomboidal indexable insert (3). All four cutting edges (5, 6, 5', 6') lie on the top side of the indexable insert (3), are rounded off at the cutting corners and are inclined rectilinearly or in a curved shape relative to the bearing surface. The indexable insert (3) is arranged in a recess in the machining section of the basic tool body in such a way that the active, front-end cutting edge (5) runs perpendicularly to the longitudinal drilling axis (A) with a maximum deviation of 0.5 DEG . One end of this cutting edge (5) determines the bore diameter, while the other end extends beyond the longitudinal drilling axis (A) in such a way that the transition point (4) from the straight cutting-edge section to the rounded-off corner section coincides with the longitudinal drilling axis or projects beyond the latter by a maximum of 10% of the cutting-edge length. As seen in front elevation of the tool, the front-end cutting edge (5) intersects the longitudinal drilling axis (A) or is at a maximum distance of 2% of the drilling diameter of the tool from the longitudinal drilling axis (A).

A cutting tool for drilling into solid material and for 
turning, comprising a substantially cylindrical tool base 

element (1) with a machining section with a chip groove (2), 
which extends in the longitudinal direction and comprises a 

recess, in which a prismatic, substantially rhombus or 
rhomboid-shaped reversible bit (3) with acute and obtuse 

corner angles of less than 89° or more than 91° is secured, 
the active cutting edges (5, 6) lying on the upper side of 

the reversible bit (3) - in the top view of the tool - and 
the active end-face cutting edge (5) extending approximately 

perpendicular to the bore longitudinal axis (A) of the tool 
and one end of said cutting edge (5) defining the bore 

diameter, whilst the other cutting edge end extends beyond 
the bore longitudinal axis (A) and this cutting edge 
(5) 
being inclined linearly or in an arc relative to the bearing 

surface (7) in such a manner that the thickness of the 
reversible bit (3) is greater at the acute-angled cutting 

corner than at the obtuse-angled cutting corner,
 
characterised in that four cutting edges (5, 6; 5', 6') lie 

on the upper side of the reversible bit (3) and are rounded 
at the cutting corners; the end-face cutting edge (5) 

extending approximately perpendicular to the bore 
longitudinal axis (A) deviates from the perpendicular by a 

maximum of 0.5°; the end of the end-face cutting edge (5) 
extending beyond the bore longitudinal axis (A) coincides 

with the bore longitudinal axis (A) at the transition point 
(4) from the straight cutting edge section to the rounded 

corner section - in the top view of the tool -, or extends 
beyond said bore longitudinal axis (A) with a length of 10% 

maximum of the over length of the cutting edge (5), and the 
end-face cutting edge (5) - in the front view of the tool - 

intersects the bore longitudinal axis (A) or lies at a 
distance from said axis of 2% maximum of the boring diameter 

of the tool.  
 
A cutting tool for drilling into solid material and 
turning according to claim 1, characterised in that the 

corner angles of the reversible bit (3) measure 88° or 92°. 
A cutting tool for drilling into solid material and 
turning according to claims 1 to 2, characterised in that 

the cutting edges (5, 6; 5', 6') extend linearly inclined 
relative to the bearing surface at an angle of 3° to 10°. 
A cutting tool for drilling into solid material and 
turning according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 

that the reversible bit (3) comprises a central aperture (9) 
and is secured via said central aperture (9) to the tool 

base element with the aid of a countersunk screw (10). 
A cutting tool for drilling into solid material and 
turning according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 

that the tool (1) comprises a bore (8) for the supply of 
cooling means, which bore opens directly onto the reversible 

bit (3) and extends in the longitudinal direction of the 
reversible bit (3).
