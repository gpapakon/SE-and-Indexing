<ABSTRACT>
The facsimile includes an electrophotographic printer intended to reproduce, on a paper medium, the image represented by an incoming message having a light source (10) supplying a beam, modulated by the incoming signal, for scanning a rotary photosensitive drum (16), means for transferring electrostatic charges depending on the illumination onto the drum, means (24) for transferring dry ink onto the drum with a density depending on the charges, means (26) for transferring this ink from the drum onto a paper medium and means for fixing the ink. The incoming message is characterised in that the incoming message is decoded line by line, and the data are supplied directly to the light source for exposing the drum, causing printing at the data rate of the communication.

A telefax machine comprising an electrophotographic
printer intended to reproduce on a paper

support the image represented by an incoming data
message, comprising:


a photosensitive drum (16) rotatable in a given
direction;
a light source (10) delivering a printing beam on
the photosensitive drum along successive lines

parallel to the axis of rotation, the light source
being intended to produce on said drum

electrostatic charges dependent upon the
illumination by the beam;
means for decoding the incoming data, line-by-line,
and delivering them directly to the drum

exposure light source, thus producing line-by-line
printing at the start of the message entry;
a motor for driving the drum at a variable speed
dependent upon the incoming speed of the data and

the decoding speed;
means (24) for transferring dry ink to the drum as
it rotates, in a density which is dependent upon

the deposited charges, said means being situated
at a position which is downstream of the said line

in the direction of rotation; and
means (26), situated downstream of the means (24)
for transferring dry ink to the drum, said means 

(26) being intended to transfer the ink from the
drum to the moving paper support (28), line-by-line,

as said lines arrive; and
means for collecting the paper (34 - 38) from the
drum after transfer and fixing the ink by pressure

and, if required, heating.
A telefax machine according to claim 1,
characterised in that the dry ink is of a type which is

fixable by pressure and in that the fixing means
comprise pressure rollers (34, 38) driven at the same

linear speed as the photosensitive drum during the
printing operation.
A telefax machine according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the photosensitive drum (16) is

driven by a stepping motor (18) in time with the
decoding of the lines.
A telefax machine according to claim 3,
characterised in that the light source comprises an

array of photo-emitter elements preceded by a memory of
a capacity equal to the number of photo-emitter

elements, equal to the number of pixels of a line.
A telefax machine according to claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in 
that it comprises a data memory having
a capacity of two lines of pixels.
A telefax machine according to claim 1,
characterised by means for driving the paper in the

fixing means at a constant speed of movement which is
independent of the drum speed. 
A telefax machine according to claim 6,
characterised in that between the transfer and fixing

the paper travels a distance at least equal to the
length of a sheet of paper.
