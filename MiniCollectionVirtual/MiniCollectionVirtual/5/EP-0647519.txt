<ABSTRACT>
The present process for manufacturing a low-odour moulded article from sound- and heat-insulating nonwoven fabric involves uniformly crosslinking the moulded article by sealing the mould cavity of a heatable press in a pressure-tight manner and introducing into this mould cavity a hot fluid acting as a heat transfer medium. This fluid is left in the compression mould under increased pressure and under steady-state conditions until the desired crosslinkage has occurred. Only then is the fluid relieved again and let out from the compression mould. A saturated dry steam is preferably used as the fluid. The moulded article manufactured by this process is distinguished by a uniform crosslinkage and a reduction in the binder content.

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a porous, sound and heat
insulating moulded article with a fleecy surface and a density

of 50 - 200 g/cm
2
, in particular for covering sound and/or heat
radiating vehicle parts, in which into the cavity of a heatable

press mould there is applied a fibre fleece of natural fibres and
binder containing thermoplastic fibres, wherein the binder

constituent part is at least 15 % by weight, preferably is 20 %
by weight and the thermoplastic fibres are selected such that

these essentially remain intact with the processing, thus do not
completely melt, this press mould is closed in a gas-tight and

pressure-tight manner, a hot fluid is admitted into the cavity
containing the fibre fleece with the binder and this is kept

under an increased pressure of 2 to 20 bar during the complete
retention time of the fibre fleece and binder in the press mould,

and before the removal of the produced moulded article from the
opened press mould the fluid is evacuated from the press mould

and led to a filter installation.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that as
water a saturated, dry water steam is used.
A porous moulded article acting in a sound and/or heat
insulating manner, manufactured according to the method according

to claim 1.
A moulded article according to claim 3, characterised in
that this is a one-layer product.
A moulded article according to one of claims 3 and 4,
characterised in that at least one decor layer or protective

layer is deposited onto this moulded article. 
A moulded article according to one of the claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that as a binder a mixture of thermoplastic and

duroplastic material is present.
A moulded article according to one of the claims 3 to 6,
characterised in that the thermoplastic fibres consist of

polypropylene, copolymers and/or bicomponent fibres.
A moulded article according to claim 7, characterised in
that the fibres have a length of approx. 4 cm.
