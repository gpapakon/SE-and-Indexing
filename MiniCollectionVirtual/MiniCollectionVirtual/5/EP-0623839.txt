<ABSTRACT>
A projection type television receiver in which 
the screen is maintained on the framework despite 

temperature changes or external force application, and 
also a large screen video display apparatus which 

displays video images with minimal loss of picture area, 
characterized by easy installation or removal of the 

screen holding frameworks, and which is excellent in 
maintainability. A plurality of projection type 

television receivers are arranged in multiple rows and 
lines for the purpose of displaying a large screen video 

image. Each projection type television receiver 
comprises a permeable screen (1) with a screening 

effect, a framework (2) for holding the permeable 
screen, an elastic member (5), one surface of which is 

fixed to the peripheral end part of the permeable screen 
(1), and the other surface of which 
is fixed to the 
framework's holding part of the permeable screen, and 

which is readily deformable according to applied 
external force, and a cabinet (3) having its opening 

installed within the framework.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a back
projection type television receiver wherein video images
are projected on a light permeable screen, and to its
application in a large screen video display apparatus.
More specifically, the present invention relates to a
structure for holding such a screen.An example of a prior art holding structure
for a permeable screen used in a back projection type
television receiver is shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. Fig.
8 shows schematically a cross-sectional view of a prior
art structure for holding a permeable screen. In
general, a projection type television receiver is used
to build a large screen video display apparatus with its
large screen measuring, for example, 700 to 900 mm in
width and about 500 to 700 mm in height.In Fig. 8, the permeable screen 1 is formed of
a Fresnel lens sheet 1a laminated with a lenticular lens
sheet 1b. The screen 1 is held by a recessed slot 2e
formed on the inner side of the periphery of a framework
2 with the peripheral end surfaces of screen 1 fixed in
said slot 2e by insertion. A plastic material like
acrylic resin is generally used as the material for the
Fresnel lens sheet 1a and lenticular lens sheet 1b.Because a large screen is held by the
framework 2, it is desirable for the material used in
the framework 2 to have strong mechanical strength, and
a metallic material is usually used to build the
framework 2. Plastic materials and metallic materials
as well expand or shrink according to temperature 
changes. Particularly, the thermal expansion
coefficient of plastic materials is much larger than
that of metallic materials. Therefore, when a plastic
material having such a relatively large thermal
expansion coefficient is used as the screen material,
the outline dimensions of the screen are changed greatly
by expansion or contraction according to the changes in
ambient temperature or humidity. For example, in case
of a screen measuring 900 mm in width, its width changes
about 3mm in total over the temperature changes of - 10
to + 40°C. In contrast, the dimensional changes of a
framework made of a metallic material due to thermal
expansion or contraction total about 1mm over the
temperature changes of - 10 to + 40 ½C. Accordingly,
on account of a big difference existing between the
framework 2 and screen 1 in expansion or contraction, it
has not been possible to realize a structure wherein the
screen 1 and framework 2 are coupled together with a
projection type television receiver incorporating a
large picture screen. As a result, the
