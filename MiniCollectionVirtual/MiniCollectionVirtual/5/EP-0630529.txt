<ABSTRACT>
A transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell (10) for measuring EM emissions. The TEM cell longitudinal axis is positioned at a fixed angle relative to the horizontal. This fixed angle results in the alignment of the orthoaxis of the TEM cell with the gravity vector. A rotatable platform (19) for supporting an electronic device (18) is positioned inside the TEM cell (10). The platform (19) is mounted horizontally, and its axis of rotation is vertical (i.e. parallel to the gravity vector). Further, the rotation axis of the rotatable platform intersects the test volume of the TEM cell. Three mutually orthogonal components of EM emissions are measured successively by placing a device (18) on the platform (19) and rotating the device (18) through two 120 degree rotations, thereby measuring three positions. Thus, it is not necessary to tilt the device (18) from a normal, horizontal operating position in order to fully test its EM emissions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus
for measuring electromagnetic (EM) emissions from, or
electromagnetic immunity of, an electronic device. More
specifically, the present invention provides an improved
gigahertz transverse electromagnetic cell (TEM) for measuring
EM emissions from a device under test (DUT) without the need
to tilt the device under test from its normal horizontal
position.Transverse Electromagnetic cells are often used to
measure radiated EM emissions from electronics devices.
Certain agencies, such as the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC), require the measurement of EM emissions in
order to guarantee that the electronic devices are not
radiating EM emissions above limits specified by the agencies.
These limits are based upon open area test site (OATS)
measurement standards. Because a TEM cell can only measure EM
emissions in a direction perpendicular to its longitudinal
axis, a device under test must be repositioned during testing
in such a way as to measure three mutually orthogonal vector
components of these emissions. This repositioning involves
rotating and tilting the device to change its orientation
relative to the cell's longitudinal axis. Once the three sets 
of measurements are complete, they may be
mathematically correlated for comparison to the OATS
standard.Because the longitudinal axis of most TEM cells
is horizontal, or parallel to the ground, one of the
three orthogonal components can be simply measured.
Measurement of the two additional orthogonal
components, however, requires rotating a device
under test 90 degrees in two planes, which includes
reorientation of the device from a horizontal to a
vertical position wherein the device's orientation
changes in relationship to the gravity vector. Some
devices cannot be titled for measurement in a TEM
cell without damaging the device or significantly
modifying its operating characteristics.There is a need, therefore, for a TEM cell that
can measure three orthogonal components to EM
emissions without requiring tilting of an electronic
device from a normal, horizontal position. The
testing apparatus of the present invention,
described in greater detail below, provides a means
for measuring three orthogonal components of EM
emissions from an electronic device without
requiring such realignment.US-A-4,837,581 discloses a device under test in
a transverse electromagnetic cell related around two 
orthogonal axes and there is no indication that
tilting this device on its side is a problem.According to one
