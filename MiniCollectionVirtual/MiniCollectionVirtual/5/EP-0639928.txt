<ABSTRACT>
A remotely controlled telephone system terminal box provides non-blocking 
connectivity between any selected unassigned pair of a plurality X of 

distribution pairs of lines and any selected plurality Y of drop pairs of 
lines and employs a plurality X of multiple-position rotary stepper switch 

blocks each driven by a stepper motor, the stepper switch blocks being 
selectively actuated by commands from a remotely located central office 

controller. A continuity test circuit within each of the terminal boxes is 
responsive to commands from the central office controller for verifying that 

electrical contact is made between an associated one of the plurality X of 
distribution pairs of lines and a selected one of the plurality Y of drop 

pairs of lines. A control pair contention circuit within each of the terminal 
boxes allows a plurality of the termina
l boxes forming a distribution network 
to be controlled by a single control pair of lines coupling all of the 

terminal boxes to the central office controller. Each control pair contention 
circuit is responsive to energization of the single control pair of lines for 

causing a selected one of the plurality of terminal boxes of the distribution 
network to become active and for causing the other terminal boxes of the 

distribution network to become inactive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to remotely controlled, automated
telephone system terminal boxes, such as pedestals, aerial terminals, and
building terminals, typically used by telephone utilities to facilitate
interconnection of telephone cable pairs. More particularly, the present
invention relates to electronically controlled, remotely actuated switching of
a non-blocking network for use by telephone companies in lieu of prior art
manual pedestals, aerial terminals or building terminals.Pedestals, aerial terminals, and building terminals are used
extensively in the telephone outside plant industry to distribute service to
telephone subscribers. A pedestal, aerial terminal or building terminal is
generally used as the cross-connect point between a multi-pair (typically 25
pairs) telephone cable and the individual pairs of wires that lead directly to
a telephone subscriber's location, such as a residence or small business. The
pairs of wires in the multi-pair cable are referred to as distribution or F2
pairs or lines, whereas the individual pairs are referred to as drop or F3
pairs or lines. In a traditional aerial terminal, for example, the multi-pair
cable is strung between telephone poles in an alley or along a road. Multiple
aerial terminals are typically spaced along the cable route such that the drop
pairs to a telephone subscriber's location do not have to travel far before
reaching the nearest terminal. Inside the terminal, cross-connect points are
provided that allow the drop pairs to be attached to many, or all, of the
pairs in the multi-pair cable. In the interest of most efficiently using a
given number of distribution pairs, the same distribution pairs are available
for cross-connecting at several terminals along a route. This example is 
equally valid for locations utilizing building terminals,
in which case the drop pairs are within a building, such
as an apartment complex, and pedestals, in which case the
distribution and drop pairs are buried, such as in a
utility trench behind a residential subdivision.Traditionally, pedestals, aerial terminals, and
building terminals have been manually wired. Thus, when
a cross-connect needs to be changed, a service person
must be dispatched to the terminal location to move or
add the particular cross-connect. This approach has
generally been acceptable in the past, but as subscriber
demand for more second line services has increased, so
has the need for automation in this portion of the
telephone network. An automated terminal must include a
