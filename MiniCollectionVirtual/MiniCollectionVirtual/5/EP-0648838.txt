<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to
metalloproteinase inhibitors and to polynucleotides
encoding such factors. In particular, the invention
relates to novel mammalian tissue inhibitors of
metalloproteinase (herein designated as type three, or
"TIMP-3"), to fragments, derivatives, and analogs
thereof and to polynucleotides encoding the same. In
another aspect, the present invention relates to novel
methods of producing such compositions, and methods of
using such compositions.Connective tissues are maintained in dynamic
equilibrium by the opposing effects of extracellular
matrix synthesis and degradation. The extracellular
connective tissue matrix consists predominantly of
collagens, with proteoglycans, fibronectin, laminin and
other minor components making up the remainder.Degradation of the matrix is brought about by
the release of neutral metalloproteinases from resident
connective tissue cells and invading inflammatory cells
that are capable of degrading at physiological pH most
of the matrix macromolecules. See Table 1, below. The
proteinases include the mammalian tissue collagenases,
gelatinases, and proteoglycanases; leukocyte collagenase
and gelatinase (Murphy et al. Biochem. J. 283: 289-221
(1982); Hibbs et al., J. Biol. Chem. 260: 2493-2500
(1985)); macrophage collagenase and elastase (Werb et
al. J. Exp. Med. 142: 346-360 (1975); Banda et al., 
Biochem. J. 193: 589-605 (1981)); and tumour
collagenases (Liotta et al., PNAS-USA 76: 2268-2272.
(1979); Liotta et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.
98: 124-198 (1981); and Salo et al., J. Biol. Chem. 258:
3058-3063 (1983)). For a general review of collagenases
and their role in normal and pathological connective
tissue turnover see Collagenase in Normal and
Pathological Connective Tissues, David E. Woolley and
John M. Evanson, eds., John Wiley & Sons Ltd. (1988).There are over five different collagen types
(I, II, III, IV, V, etc.) which are differentially
distributed among tissues. There is considerable
homology and structural similarity among the various
collagen types. Particular collagenases show some
specificity for particular collagen types. See Table 1,
below; Matrisian, Trends In Genetics 6: 121-125 (1990).
With regard to inhibition of collagenases and other
matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, it is possible
that, depending on the actual enzymes, substrates, and
inhibitory mechanisms, an inhibitor could act on just
one, on several, or on all collagenases and
metalloproteinases.
