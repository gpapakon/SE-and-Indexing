<ABSTRACT>
The package-forming unit (12) brings printed products into a tubular shape and wraps them with a holding element. The packages (20) thus formed are ejected into a first stacking shaft (22) which, as soon as a specific number of packages (20) are stacked therein, is emptied into a second stacking shaft (24). A band (30) is then laid around the stacked packages (20), in order to hold them together so as to form a bundle (32) which is easy to handle.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for processing printing products, such 
as newspapers and periodicals, having a pack-forming unit 

(12) with means (56, 112) which are intended to bring the 
fed printing products (16) into a tube-like form, and 

means (18, 56, 112) for feeding and applying a retaining 
element (34) keeping the printing products (16) together 

in the tube-like form, which apparatus is characterized 
by a stacking device which is arranged underneath the 

pack-forming unit (12) and in the stack compartment (22) 
of which, which can be closed at the bottom by a movable 

base (40), the outlet of the pack-forming unit (12) opens 
out and into which the packs (20) of approximately the 

same direction of longitudinal extent can be introduced; and by a 
further stack compartment (24) which is arranged 

underneath the base (40) and into which the packs (20) 
stacked in the stack compartment (22) fall upon brief 

opening of the base (40), and to which an ejector (26) is 
assigned for ejecting the packs (20), preferably in the 

direction of their longitudinal extent, and feeding to a 
bundle-forming device which is arranged next to the 

further stack compartment and is intended for the purpose 
of laying around the stacked packs (20) a preferably 

strap-like bundling element (30) in order to keep said 
packs in the form of a bundle (32). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the stack compartment (22) has two mutually opposite 

compartment walls (36) which can be swivelled about 
approximately horizontal axes (38), and on the 

compartment walls (36) there are arranged base elements  
 

which, in the stacking position (44) of the compartment 
walls (36), close the stack compartment (22) at the 

bottom and, upon swivelling of the compartment walls (36) 
into an emptying position (44'), open the stack 

compartment (22). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that, in the emptying position, the ends of the base 

elements facing away from the relevant compartment walls 
(36) are approximately aligned with stack compartment 

walls (46) of the further stack compartment (24).
