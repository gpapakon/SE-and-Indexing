<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image 
record/playback apparatus comprising a motion-picture 
camera which contains a recording medium and a playback 
device from which the camera can be removed and which is 
designed to reproduce images from the recording medium. There are known various systems each comprising a 
playback device used as an adapter and a video camera 
electrically connected to the playback device and 
containing a roll of video tape used as a recording 
medium. Among these systems is, for example, the 8-mm 
video tape recorder (VTR) manufactured by Polaroid, Inc. The video camera of this system incorporates a 
video-tape driving mechanism, a photographing lens and 
video-signal processing circuit, and contains a roll of 
video tape. It has no circuit for reproducing images 
from the video tape. The playback device of the system 
has an auxiliary video playback circuit. Thus, in order 
to reproduce the images from the video tape, the video 
camera is connected by a connector to the auxiliary 
video playback circuit built in the playback device. 
Once the camera is connected to the playback device, 
power can be supplied to the video-tape driving 
mechanism, so that the mechanism may drive the video 
tape. The operating mode of the video camera can be 
switched during playback operation in accordance with  
 
a mode switching signal supplied from the playback 
device to the video camera. The operation of the camera 
is initiated and terminated by operating a button switch 
provided on the playback device. To record images on the video tape, the video 
camera is disconnected from the playback device and then 
operated. To reproduce the images from the tape, the 
camera is connected to the playback device and the 
playback device is operated. The video camera is a very 
expensive component. Were it be lost, stolen or 
damaged, the owner of the system would suffer from a 
great economical loss. In business of rending video 
cameras, the clerks must comply complex no-life 
insurance formalities for the system. There has been a 
great demand for a video camera which is as inexpensive, 
small and light as is possible. Accordingly, a first object of the present 
invention is to provide an image record/playback 
apparatus which comprises a camera as inexpensive, 
small, light and portable as possible and, therefore, 
suitable for camera renting business. A second object of the invention is to provide an 
image record/playback apparatus comprising a camera 
which is designed to photograph an
