<ABSTRACT>
In a spark plug electrode in which a noble metal 
alloyed tip is secured to a firing end of one of opposed 

electrodes which forms a spark gap therebetween, the 
alloyed tip has a noble metal component varied in an 

axial direction of the electrode depending on a total 
magnitude of spark discharges to which a specified 

portion of the tip is subjected between the opposed 
electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a spark plug electrode 
in which a spark-erosion resistant noble metal containing 
tip is secured to a firing end of a centre or ground 
electrode. With the recent demand of enhancing a spark-erosion 
resistant property of an electrode for use in an 
internal combustion engine, Japanese Patent Publication No 
62-31797 introduces a technique in which annular noble 
metal tips 103, 104 in turn cover firing ends of centre 
electrode metals 101, 102 of multi-polarity type and semi-creeping 
discharge type spark plugs 100, 100a as shown in 
Figures 11 and 12 of the attached drawings. JP-A-50 67488 discloses a similar spark plug 
electrode in which a precious metal chip, of a sintered 
body of a rare earth metallic oxide and iridium or 
ruthenium, is welded onto the centre eIectrode. US-A-4 963 112 discloses a spark plug electrode 
in accordance with the precharacterising portion of claim 
1. Again, a platinum alloy chip is attached to the end of 
a centre electrode and laser welded on in such a way as to 
create an alloy zone between the chip and electrode of 
gradually decreasing platinum content away from the tip. With the arrangement illustrated in Figures 11 
and 12, though, due to the positional relationship between 
the centre electrode metals 101, 102 and ground electrode 
105, 106, the tips 103, 104 tend to be locally eroded in a 
manner as shown at a left half in Figures 11 and 12. 
Although the spark erosion makes spark gaps 107, 108 
unacceptably greater which deteriorates the service life 
of the spark plug, an expensive noble metal component of 
the tip partially remains uneroded which makes the 
technique uneconomical.  
 In order to avoid the uneconomical disadvantage, 
it has been considered to previously omit noble metal from 
an uneroded part of the tip as shown at the left half 109 
in Figure 13a. However, the centre electrode metal 101 is spark 
eroded significantly as spark discharges repeatedly occur 
between the electrodes as shown in Figures 13b to 13d. 
This makes the service life of the spark plug 110 
increasingly shorter than that of the spark plugs 100, 
100a. This is presumably because the spark discharges 
still occur in the portion 109 of the electrode 101 where 
there is no noble metal, although the total magnitude of 
these spark discharges is substantially limited when 
compared with the portion including the noble metal. Therefore, it is an object of the invention to 
provide a spark plug electrode for use in an internal 
combustion engine which is
