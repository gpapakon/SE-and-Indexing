<ABSTRACT>
The composition for fixing plugs, threaded rods and the like in holes, in particular drilled holes, in concrete, stone and masonry, based on water glass, containing at least one fine, highly active reactant such as, for example, SiO2 and/or Al2O3, in particular from waste materials, and also containing fillers such as, for example, quartz flour and/or quartz sand, is characterised in that the water glass, in particular potash water glass, has a molar ratio of SiO2 to alkali metal oxide of 
>
 1.4, preferably 1.45 - 1.60, but in any case 
<
 2, and that the composition additionally contains, as hardener, based on 100 parts by weight of water glass, 10-40 parts by weight, preferably 20-30 parts by weight of a compound which neutralises the alkali of the water glass by elimination of an acid which is stronger than silicic acid. The hardener is, in particular, ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate and/or butylene carbonate. It is advantageous to add to the composition, based on 100 parts by weight of water glass, about 20-40 parts by weight, preferably about 30-35 parts by weight, of a, preferably inorganic, thixotrope, e.g. a bentonite activated by alkali, and also about 10-40 parts by weight, preferably about 20-30 parts by weight, of a fluidiser, in particular a silane emulsion.

drilled holes, in concrete, stone and masonry, having
at least one fine-particled, highly active reactant,

such as, for example, SiO
2
 and/or Al
2
O
3
, in particular
comprising waste materials, and having fillers, such

as, for example, quartz powder and/or quartz sand,
characterized in that the waterglass, in particular

potassium waterglass, has a molar ratio of SiO
2
 to
alkali metal oxide of 
>
1.4, preferably 1.45 - 1.60, but
in any case 
<
2, and that the material furthermore
contains 10-40, preferably 20-30, parts by weight,

with elimination of an acid stronger than the silicic
acid.
Material according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the acid is carbonic acid or the compound

neutralizing the alkali of the waterglass, in
particular ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate

and/or butylene carbonate.
Material according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that it furthermore contains, based on

100 parts by weight of waterglass about 20-40,
preferably about 30-35, parts by weight of a -

preferably inorganic - thixotropic agent and about 10-40,
preferably about 20-30, parts by weight of a

liquefier, in particular a silane emulsion.
Material according to Claim 3, characterized in
that the thixotropic agent is a bentonite activated by

means of alkali.
Material according to any of the preceding 
Claims, characterized in that it furthermore contains

about 10-30, preferably about 15-20, parts by weight,
based on 100 parts by weight of filler, of a lubricant,

in particular very highly disperse TiO

Material according to any of the preceding
Claims, characterized in that the filler consists of a

mixture of quartz sand, preferably having a particle
size of 0.4 mm, and quartz powder, in particular in a

ratio of 7:5 to 7:1, preferably about 7:1 when pure
potassium waterglass is used and preferably about 7:5

when sodium potassium waterglass is used.
Material according to any of the preceding
Claims, characterized in that, after hardening, it has

at least one of the following properties: it has a
shrinkage of less than 0.5%, forms no cracks, does not

form a bow-shaped depression and is heat-resistant up
to 900°C, nonflammable, water-resistant, acid-resistant

and alkali-resistant.
Process for the preparation of a material
according to any of Claims 1 to 7, characterized in

that the waterglass is initially taken, optionally
together with a liquefier, and that highly active

reactants, in particular SiO
2
 and/or Al

together with a thixotropic agent and a lubricant, then

the fillers are added, also with stirring, and then the
hardener is incorporated.
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in
