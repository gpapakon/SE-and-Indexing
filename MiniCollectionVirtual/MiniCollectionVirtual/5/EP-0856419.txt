<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a cap for a
writing means provided with a suffocation preventive

construction in which even if a curious child or the
like should swallow accidentally to stop its throat or

bronchus, a flow of air is sufficiently secured to avoid
suffocation, and particularly to a cap for a writing

means of a double-tube construction in which in a state
where an air communicating portion (3) is secured in an

inner peripheral surface of an outer tube (1) having
front and rear portions opened, a closed-end tubular

inner tube (2) is held coaxially within the outer tube
(1), wherein a predetermined clearance (11) for

communication between the air communicating portion (3)
between the outer tube (1) and the inner tube (2) and a

front-end opening side of the outer tube (1) is
provided between an inclined lower end of a taper

portion (6) provided in the front-end opening of the
inner tube (2) and the inner peripheral surface of the

outer tube (1), whereby the permeability is not
impaired by ink adhered to the taper portion (6) during

the process of mounting to the axial tube (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cap for a pen, and particularly to a
cap of a double-tube construction wherein an air communicating portion
is secured in an inner peripheral surface of an outer tube having front
and rear open ends and a closed-end tubular inner tube is fitted into and
held coaxially within the outer tube, whereby a suffocation preventive
construction results in which, even if a curious child or the like should
swallow it accidentally, blocking its throat or bronchus, a flow of air
sufficient secured to avoid suffocation can be maintained.In the past, a cap of a double construction has been known
which comprises an outer tube having open front and rear ends and a
closed-end inner tube is held coaxially within the outer tube such that an
air communicating portion is provided between the tubes. The inner
tube has a taper portion for guiding the pen body into the inner tube
during the mounting of the pen to the cap (disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Nos. Hei 2-58981 and 4-117790).The conventional cap disclosed in the aforementioned Japanese
Utility Model Laid-Open No. Hei 4-117790 is constructed such that the
outer tube and the inner tube are integrally connected at a bridge
portion. The front surface of the bridge portion facing the front-end of
the outer tube comprises a taper portion enlarged and inclined from the 
front-end of the inner tube and the pen body is guided into the inner
tube by the taper portion. The bridge portion is peripherally provided
with several vent holes to provide a permeable cap in which the rear-end
and the front-end are communicated, whereby even if a child should
swallow it accidentally suffocation can be avoided.During the process for guiding the pen body into the inner tube,
ink tends to be adhered to the taper portion, such adhesion being
unavoidable. Accordingly, in the past, the ink adhered to the taper
portion can flow (enter) into the vent holes of the bridge portion and
becomes solidified to close the vent holes. That is, permeability of the
cap can be impeded.Patent Application No WO 93/09960 discloses a cap of a double
tube construction which is composed of an open ended outer tube and a
closed end inner tube held coaxially within the outer tube to provide an
air communicating portion between the tubes and there is a taper
portion for guiding a pen into the inner tube during the process of
mounting the cap on the pen. The cap has a predetermined clearance
communicating with the air communicating portion. The clearance is
defined

<CLAIMS>
A cap of a double tube construction for a pen having a pen body (5)
and an axial tube (4), said cap having a front end and a rear end and

comprising an open ended outer tube (1) and an inner tube (2) having
an open end and a closed end, the inner tube (2) being fitted into the

outer tube so as to be concentric therewith, an air communicating
portion (3) extending through the cap from front to rear and between

the inner tube (2) and the outer tube (1), said inner tube (2) having a
taper portion (6) for guiding the pen body (5) into the inner tube (2)

during the process of mounting the cap on the pen axial tube (4), and

wherein there is a predetermined clearance (11) connecting the air
communication portion (3) with the front end opening side of the

outer tube (1) and lying between the inner peripheral surface of the
outer tube (1) and an inclined lower edge portion (6-1) of the taper

portion (6), which lower edge portion (6-1) is enlarged and inclined
from the front end opening of the inner tube (2) toward the front-end

opening of the outer tube (1),
Characterised in that
 the air communicating portion (3) from where it
starts at the rear end of the cap comprises an annular opening (3-10)

in and extending over part of the length of the inner tube (2) so that
over said length that portion (2-2) of the inner tube (2) outwardly of

the annular opening (3-10) can absorb load stress because of
dimensional error as the inner tube is fitted into the outer tube (1). 
A cap for a pen according to claim 1, wherein the taper
portion (6) is provided at the inclined lower end with a liquid stopping

flat portion (16) having a suitable annular width capable of keeping
liquid spaced relative to the clearance (11)
A cap for a pen according to claim 1, wherein the air
communicating portion (3) is formed to be of a substantially cranked

configuration in longitudinal section comprising a rear-side
communicating portion (3-1) provided coaxially and annularly in the

inner tube (2) in a suitable range from the closed end of the inner tube
(2) toward the front-end and a front-side communicating portion (3-3)

provided between the inner tube (2) and the outer tube (1) peripherally
bent and communicating with the rear-side communicating portion (3-1)

in the range from the rear-side communicating portion (3-1) to the
front-end opening of the inner tube (2).
A cap for a pen according to claim 3, wherein the inner tube
(2) is provided at the rear end at the outer peripheral edge thereof with a

large diameter collar portion (12) in contact with and stopped at the
rear-end surface of the outer tube (1), and the outside diameter of the

inner tube (2) over said portion (2-2) from the large-diameter collar
portion (12) is formed to have the size capable of being fitted into the

outer tube (1).
A cap for a pen according to claim 4, wherein a stopping
convex portion (9) is provided at an outer peripheral surface part spaced

from the large diameter collar portion (12) toward the of the inner tube
(2), and a stopping shoulder (10) for stopping said stopping convex 

portion (9) is provided on the inner peripheral surface of the outer tube
(1)
A cap for a pen according to claim 1, wherein peripheral
several longitudinal ribs (14) are provided on the outer peripheral

surface of the inner tube (2).
A cap for a pen according to claim 1, wherein the clearance
(11) is an annular opening.
