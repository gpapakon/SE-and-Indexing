<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fiber optic communication 
systems and more specifically to fiber optic transmitters 
incorporating laser diodes for transforming electrical data 
signals into optical data signals. Semiconductor laser diodes are well-known for their 
applications in fiber optic communications links. These 
devices have been used in systems for long distance fiber 
optic communications since the early 1980's. Laser diodes 
used in fiber optic communications applications have 
typically been expensive since sorting of the laser diodes is 
required to select those devices with desired performance 
characteristics. Further, packaging and special temperature 
maintaining circuits contribute to the expense associated 
with implementation of laser diodes. Subsequently, laser diodes were developed for use in 
audio electronics devices such as compact disc players. 
Laser diodes used in compact disc players are designed to be 
low cost and have simple packaging requirements as a 
component of the overall cost objective. Two types of laser 
diodes were developed for the compact disc player products. 
The first is a self-pulsating laser diode that has a rather 
broad spectrum consisting of many longitudinal modes or 
spectra. Examples of this device are the Sharp LT023, the 
Mitsubishi ML4014C, and the Sony SLD104AU. These devices 
were developed to have excellent signal-to-noise (S/N) 
characteristics even in the occurrence of strong back 
reflection of light from the application back into the laser 
cavity. A graph depicting a typical spectral response for 
the Sharp LT023 device is shown in Fig. 1 and a  
 
signal-to-noise curve for the device is shown in Fig. 2. 
Note that multiple graphs or curves are shown in Fig. 1, each 
illustrating the response of the device at a specific power 
output level, i.e. 0.5 milliwatts, 1.0 milliwatt, 3.0 
milliwatts and 5.0 milliwatts. Self-pulsating lasers tend to "ring" strongly with 
modulation. This characteristic must be filtered out by a 
fiber optic receiver in order to properly recover the 
modulated data signal. A self-pulsating laser has been 
specified in the most widely used low cost fiber optic data 
communications system standard known as "Fiber Channel". 
This standard was developed and written primarily by the IBM 
Corporation participating in the ANSI X3T9.3 Committee. The 
natural frequency of self-pulsating lasers is typically 
between 1 and 2 gigahertz (GHz). Thus, the requirement of 
the Fiber Channel specification that there be at least three
