<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes novel assays employing a capture reagent, involving a first binding member conjugated to a polymeric anion such as carboxymethylamylose, and a solid phase material containing a reaction site comprising a polymeric cation substance. A test sample suspected of containing the analyte of interest may be contacted with the capture reagent to form a charged capture reagent/analyte complex. The complex is then contacted to the oppositely charged solid phase to attract, attach, and immobilize the capture reagent/analyte complex. The use of carboxymethylamylose to prepare a suitably charged capture reagent provides a superior capture reagent that is capable of binding and retaining the analyte on the solid phase even in the presence of polyanionic non-specific binding blockers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of binding assay devices and
methods.Various analytical procedures and devices are commonly employed in
assays to determine the presence and/or concentration of substances of interest or
clinical significance which may be present in biological liquids or other
materials. Such substances are commonly termed "analytes" and can include
antibodies, antigens, drugs, hormones, etc.Immunoassay techniques take advantage of the mechanisms of the immune
systems of higher organisms, wherein antibodies are produced in response to the
presence of antigens which are pathogenic or foreign to the organisms. These
antibodies and antigens, i.e., immunoreactants, are capable of binding with one
another, thereby creating a highly specific reaction mechanism which can be used
in vitro to determine the presence or concentration of that particular antigen in a
biological sample.There are several known immunoassay methods using immunoreactants,
wherein at least one of the immunoreactants is labeled with a detectable
component so as to be analytically identifiable. For example, the "sandwich" or
"two-site" technique may involve the formation of a ternary complex between an
antigen and two antibodies. A convenient method of detecting complex formation in
such a technique is to provide one labeled antibody and an unlabeled antibody bound
to a solid phase support such that the complex can readily be isolated. In this
example, the amount of labeled antibody associated with the solid phase is directly
proportional to the amount of analyte in the test sample. An alternative technique is the "competitive" assay. In one example of a
competitive assay, the capture mechanism again may use an antibody attached to
an insoluble solid phase, but a labeled analyte (rather than a labeled antibody)
competes with the analyte present in the test sample for binding to the
immobilized antibody. Similarly, an immobilized analyte can compete with the
analyte of interest for a labeled antibody. In these competitive assays, the
quantity of captured labeled reagent is inversely proportional to the amount of
analyte present in the sample.Despite their great utility, there are disadvantages with such assay
methods. First, the heterogenous reaction mixture of liquid test sample and
soluble and insoluble assay reagents, can retard the kinetics of the reaction. In
comparison to a liquid phase reaction wherein all reagents are soluble, i.e. a
homogeneous reaction mixture, the heterogenous reaction mixture can
