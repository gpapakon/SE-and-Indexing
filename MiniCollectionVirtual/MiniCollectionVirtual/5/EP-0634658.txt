<ABSTRACT>
In a biochemical analysis apparatus (10), a dry-type 
frameless chemical analysis film (1) having a base (1a) and a 

reagent layer (1b) formed thereon is taken out from a 
cartridge (2) in which a plurality of such frameless chemical 

analysis films are stacked. Then the film is spotted 
with a sample liquid and is transferred to a cell (42) in an 

incubator (12) to be incubated at a constant temperature, 
whereby coloring reaction between the reagent layer and a 

particular biochemical component in the sample liquid is 
caused and the optical density of the coloring matter 

formed is measured (16). A horseshoe-like film transfer 
member (73) receives the film taken out from the cartridge and 

inserts it into the cell while holding it, and a suction 
member (70) enters the cell from below the cell and holds the 

film inserted by the film transfer member.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a biochemical analysis
apparatus which spots a sample liquid such as blood,
serum, urine or the like on a dry-type frameless chemical
analysis film having thereon a reagent layer (spreading
layer) whose optical density changes by chemical
reaction, immunoreaction, or the like with a specific
biochemical component contained in the sample liquid and
determines the concentration of the specific biochemical
component in the sample liquid by measuring the optical
density of the film.There has been put into practice a biochemical
analysis apparatus using a dry-type chemical analysis
film with which a specific component contained in a
sample liquid can be quantified through a droplet of the
sample liquid spotted on the slide. When chemical
components or the like contained in a sample liquid is
analyzed using such a dry-type chemical analysis film, a
droplet of the sample liquid is spotted on the slide and
is held at a constant temperature for a predetermined
time (incubation) in an incubator so that coloring
reaction occurs, and the optical density of the color
formed by the coloring reaction is optically measured.
That is, measuring light containing a wavelength which is 
pre-selected according to the combination of the
component to be analyzed and the reagent contained in the
reagent layer of the film is projected onto the film and
the optical density of the film is measured. Then the
component to be analyzed is quantified on the basis of
the optical density using a calibration curve which
represents the relation between the concentration of the
biochemical component and the optical density. EP 0 458 138 A2 discloses a slide analysis system including a slide holding module
spaced from an incubator module. A slide transfer device withdraws slides from the slide
holding module and inserts them into the incubator module. A metering device deposits
serum onto a slide that is held in a spotting position by the slide transfer device. The
slide transfer device has rotational as well as transverse movement and includes jaws for
gripping onto the sides of the slides to withdraw a single slide from the cartridge,
transport it to the incubator, insert the slide in the incubator and thereafter remove it from
the incubator.EP 0 397 256 A2 discloses an analyser featuring a circular track of cartridges centered
on an incubator. The analyser arrangement includes the incubator and two circular paths
arranged around the incubator. Cartridges are loaded with test elements ("slides") at a
cartridge-load

a plurality of pressing means (61) for pressing the corresponding inserted
frameless chemical analysis film (1) against the bottom (45) of the cell (42) to

hold the chemical analysis film (1) flat; and
a plurality of enclosing means (64) surrounding each of said corresponding
pressing means (61), for tightly enclosing the corresponding cell (42) in which

the inserted frameless chemical analysis film (1) pressed by said pressing
means (61) is accommodated.
