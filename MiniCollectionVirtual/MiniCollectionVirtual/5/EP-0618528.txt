<ABSTRACT>
A computer based touchscreen includes a mechanism for 
displaying buttons on the touchscreen indicating the location 

where an user has touched the touchscreen. Because 
different operators will view the buttons from different 

angles, they will touch the touchscreen in different positions. 
An initial button or series of buttons of the 

application that the user is using is configured to sense 
the location where the user is touching. These initial 

button(s) are called adjusting buttons. The button sensing 
regions for the remaining buttons (non-adjusting buttons) 

are calibrated from these initial touched locations. 
For example, if the user tends to press high and to the 

right of the adjusting button(s), the orientation of the 
button sensing regions for the remaining buttons is calibrated 

high and to the right. If multiple adjusting buttons 
are used, the average of the touched positions is 

used to calibrate the button sensing regions of the non-adjusting 
buttons. The adjusting buttons are not restricted 

to the beginning of the application. Any screen 
that displays buttons can be used to calibrate or 

recalibrate the button sensing region for subsequent non-adjusting 
buttons. This allows for greater accuracy 

should the users change their view or angle of the 
touchscreen as they use the application. Thus, the computer 

dynamically adjusts the orientation of a touchscreen 
button's sensing region based on the location that the 

user has pressed for previous buttons. This dynamic adjustment 
allows a high density of buttons to be displayed 

on the touchscreen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the data processing field. More
particularly, this invention relates to a touchscreen
apparatus for adjusting a sensing region based on the
location that the user touches on the touchscreen, which
is contained in a display.Touchscreens are well known in the art where the user
communicates a desired action to a computer by touching a
touchscreen in a specific location. The computer system
displays graphics on the touchscreen that represent buttons.
The user interfaces to the computer system by
touching the touchscreen in a displayed button's sensing
region, which is the area on the touchscreen that the
computer system associates with the button. The computer
system detects the user's touch, maps the touched location
to a particular button, and performs appropriate functions
based on the button that the user selected via the touch.Touchscreens are advantageous in that they can eliminate
the need for a keyboard or other input device in applications
where a separate input device would be cumbersome,
expensive, or susceptible to vandalism. Also, with a
touchscreen the user is not forced to read instructions in
one place and hunt elsewhere, such as on a keyboard, for
keys to press. Instead, the instructions that the user
reads and the buttons that the user touches are in the
same proximity. This close proximity of instructions and
buttons is more convenient and faster for the user and
reduces the chance of incorrect button selection.However, touchscreens suffer from the problem that the
buttons on the touchscreen are two dimensional, and although 
the buttons are visually distinct from one another,
they are not physically distinct from one another. Thus,
while a user of a conventional keyboard can feel when a
finger is straying over the edge of the intended key and
onto an adjacent, unintended key, the user of a
touchscreen cannot feel when a finger is straying over the
edge of a button. These problems are exacerbated by the
fact that the touchscreen has thickness, so while the
button is projected onto the back of the touchscreen, the
user touches it from the front. This screen thickness plus
the parallax effect, causes different users to perceive
the same button in potentially different places. For
example, tall users standing to the right of the
touchscreen will tend to perceive the button as being
above and to the right of the actual button position, so
they will tend to touch high and to the right of the button
sensing region. Analogously, short users standing to
the left of the

<CLAIMS>
A touchscreen apparatus for receiving instructions from a
user, comprising :


means for displaying a first button on the touchscreen,
the first button having a first sensing region;
means for receiving an indication that the user touched

the touchscreen at a first location;
means for determining that the first location is within
the first sensing region of the first button ;

   characterized by :

means for calculating an adjustment factor from the first
button and the first location; and
means for displaying a second button on the touschscreen,
the second button having a second sensing region

calibrated from the adjustment factor, wherein the
calculating means further comprises means for computing

the difference between the center of the first sensing
region and the touched location.
The touchscreen apparatus of claim 1, further comprising :

means for receiving an indication that the user touched
the touschscreen at a second location; and
means for determining that the second location is within
the second sensing region.
The touchscreen apparatus of claim 2, further comprising :

means for calculating a second factor based on the
distance of the second location from the center of the

second sensing region; 
means for computing an adjustment factor by taking the
average of the first factor and the second factor; and
means for displaying a third button on the touchscreen,
the third button having a third sensing region calibrated

from the adjustment factor.
The touchscreen apparatus of claim 3, further comprising :

means for receiving an indication that the user touched
the touchscreen at a third location; and
means for performing processing in response to the user
pressing the third button.
The touchscreen apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 4 wherein
determining means further comprises :

means for detecting that said location is within said
sensing region, but not within said button, and reporting

that said button has been touched.
The touchscreen apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 4 wherein
determining means further comprises :

means for detecting that said location is within said
sensing region and is also within said button, and

reporting that said button has been touched.
The touchscreen apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 4 wherein
determining means further comprises :

means for detecting that said location is within said
button but is not within said sensing region, and

reporting that said button has not been touched.
