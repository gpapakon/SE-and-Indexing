<ABSTRACT>
A clutch unit for the main power take-off of agricultural 
tractors, having its input shaft (5) aligned with the engine shaft 

to which it is connected and its coaxial output shaft (6) driving 
the power take-off (3) via a change-speed gear unit, is positioned 

behind the rear wheel axle, with the drive hub (61) positioned to 
the rear of the power take-off change-speed gear unit, so as to be 

accessible from the outside by removing a cover (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a vehicle including a
clutch unit
associated with a power take-off system as defined in the preamble
of claim 1 and known from EP-A-511 480.The invention specifically relates to a particular arrangement of
said clutch unit.Tractors in general, to which the invention particularly but not
exclusively applies, are known to be provided at their rear with a
power take-off, hereinafter called the main power take-off for
convenience, which is used for various applications, for example
for operating agricultural equipment.Modern tractors are also known to be provided with a further power
take-off, also situated to the rear of the vehicle frame and
hereinafter called the secondary power take-off, which is used to
drive the wheels of appliances towed by the tractor.The invention relates to the clutch unit for the so-called main
power take-off.In a totally general sense, said power take-off represents the
output shaft of a change-speed gear unit which is driven by an
input shaft directly connected to the engine shaft by way of a
clutch unit.The clutch unit can be of the type with its plates in an oil bath,
or of another type such as mechanical, without influencing the 
invention.Consideration will now be given to the position occupied by the
clutch unit in the known art.In known constructions the clutch unit is spaced from the power
take-off by a relatively large distance, and is normally arranged
in front of the rear wheel axle.In those infrequent cases in which the clutch unit is positioned
to the rear of the rear wheel axle, it is practically inaccessible
from the outside as it lies in front of the change-speed gear unit
of the power take-off.Basically, the clutch unit is positioned in a difficultly
accessible region, as tractor drivers and mechanics have found,
with the result that inspection, maintenance and repair are
lengthy, difficult and uncomfortable.The generic
EP-A-511480 discloses a power take off change speed gear unit
comprising a clutch unit having a drive hub connected to the
clutch input shaft which is aligned with and connected to the
engine shaft and a driven cup shaped member connected to a hollow
output shaft receiving said clutch input shaft, and driving the rear
power take off shaft.
The clutch is located between two pinions of the speed gear unit,
which is contained in a casing which is closed at the rear side of
said power take off change speed gear unit by a removable cover.
The
removal of said cover does not give direct access to the drive
hub of the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle having a front and a rear wheel axle and including
a power take-off system with a clutch unit (2), a

power take-off change-speed gear unit offering by means of
meshing gears (10/110, 11/111) two speeds to be transmitted

to a power take-off shaft;

said clutch unit (2) having a drive hub (61) connected to
a clutch input shaft (51) which is aligned with and connected

to an engine shaft;
said clutch having a driven cup-shaped member (8) connected
to a hollow output shaft (6) in which said clutch

input shaft is mounted and which drives via said meshing
gears (10/110, 11/111) said power take-off shaft (3), -

said clutch unit (2) and said power take-off change-speed
gear unit are contained in a casing (1) which is closed at

the rear-side of said power take-off change-speed gear unit
by a removable cover (13),
characterised in that
said clutch unit (2) is positioned at the rear-side of
said power take-off change-speed gear unit and behind the

rear wheel axle,
said clutch unit (2) is contained within a compartment
defined by said cover (13), and
said drive hub (61) of said clutch unit (2) is positioned
on the rear end of said clutch input shaft (51) so as to be

immediately accessible from the outside after removal of
said cover (13).
The device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said cover
(13) comprises a hole (14) which receives the power

take-off shaft in a sealed manner.
