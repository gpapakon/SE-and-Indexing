<ABSTRACT>
In optical distribution systems, a signal designated for the subscribers is distributed from a transmission point to all network terminations (point-to-multipoint transmission). The receivers connected to a passive optical network are adapted to a common bit repetition rate (frequency). If a requirement for higher data rates arises on one network termination, this requirement can only be met by converting all the receivers. This is not possible without interrupting the service. Furthermore, the conversion entails high costs, since the network termination receivers whose data requirements remain unchanged are also converted. Using a time division multiplexing method, a time division multiplex signal is generated which has a frame which corresponds to one bit period (T) of a digital signal and which is divided up into k time slots (ZS). At least two time slots (ZS) are used for one digital signal and one time slot (ZS) is used in each case for the remaining digital signals.

Bitwise time-division multiplex method for the transmission of n digital
signal of equal bit rate (A, B, C), in which there is formed from these digital

signals a time-division multiplex signal (Mux) with a frame, containing k time
slot (ZS), the duration of which is equal to the bit duration (T) of one of the

digital signals, 
characterized in that
 k

two time slots (ZS), ordered in temporal succession in the frame, are used

for one of the digital signals (A) and one time slot is respectively used for
each of the remaining digital signals (B, C).
Time-division multiplex method according to Claim 1, in which a time-division
multiplex signal (Mux) is formed from two digital signals and the

frame is divided into three time slots (ZS), 
characterized in that
 two time
slots (ZS) are used for one digital signal and one time slot (ZS) is used for

the other.
Time-division multiplex method according to Claim 1, in which a time-division
multiplex signal is formed from two digital signals and the frame is

divided into four time slots (ZS), 
characterized in that
 three time slots (ZS)
are used for one digital signal and one time slot (ZS) is used for the other.
Time-division multiplex method according to Claim 1, in which a time-division
multiplex signal (Mux) is formed from three digital signals and the

frame is divided into four time slots (ZS), 
characterized in that
 two time
slots (ZS) are used for one digital signal and one time slot (ZS) is used for

each of the other two.

two adjacent inputs being connected to one another for the purpose of

supplying one and the same digital signal (A) to these connected inputs,
and which is suitable for distributing n digital signals (A, B, C) to k time slots 

(ZS) for the execution of the bitwise time-division multiplex method
according to Claim 1 and subsequently combining them to form a time-division

multiplex signal in such a way that at least two time slots (ZS),

signals (A) and one time slot is respectively used for each of the remaining
digital signals (B, C).

slot so that at least two sampling frequencies are differentiated by at least
the factor two.
