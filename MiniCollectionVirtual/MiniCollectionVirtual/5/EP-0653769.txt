<ABSTRACT>
A rocker switch with a front protection cap, wherein 
the protection cap comprises two elements: one inside 

(16) framework shaped and made from rigid material, 
provided with teeth (18) for coupling to the body of 

the rocker switch, and one outside (17), made from soft 
material, preferably transparent, integrally coupled to 

said inside element (16) so as to form one only unit 
which is designed to be applied to the front of the 

switch in order to encase the switch and the housing in 
which it rocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the sector of
electric switches, and it particularly concerns a
rocker switch with elastic front protection cap.Switches of this type may be unipolar or bipolar of
various sizes, and they find wide application in
electric and electronic appliances and in white goods
destined to operate in surroundings with a high degree
of humidity and/or in the presence of liquids. To meet
the requirements of safety standards, such switches
should should be protected against humidity and water;
for this reason they are supplied with a supple,
usually transparent, protection cap to be applied to
the front of the switch body so as to encase the switch
and cover the switch housing. In a known arrangement, the protection cap is made
from soft material and is provided with a perimetric
flange which perfectly fits the front of the switch
body around the rocker switch. The perimetric flange of
the cap, as a seal, is applied and blocked to said
front of switch body by means of a rigid framework
provided with teeth so as to be snappingly applied to
the said body.Therefore, the cap and the mounting thereof require
the presence of two separate components. Besides, to
apply the framework onto the switch body, interruptions
must be provided along the cap flange, in points
corresponding to the coupling teeth. So, besides
entailing two separate components, a cap according to
such known embodiment can not ensure secure utmost
tightness, since the interruptions provided in the
flange may form ways through which liquid or damp
penetrate.According to another known arrangement, the
protection cap for a switch of the type as described
above consists of three components which permit to
improve tightness, but on the other hand they have a
certain complexity in execution and assembly. Document DE-A-1.615.710 discloses, for instance,
a protective cap applied to a switch suitable for
installation in a flush-fit box, typically for garages,
cellars and outdoors. In this document, such a
cap includes a rigid cover and a flexible cap and is
to be fitted to a sealing ring (gasket). The cover
must be secured to the swith body by means of screws
and close the front of the flush-fit box, also. The
cap is fixed to the cover without covering it completely
and the seal must be secured in position between
the cover and the flush-fit box for thight seal.In this configuration, it is not evident how
and when the cap is fixed to the cover as it is
necessary to have access to the screws securing the
cover to the switch body, and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A rocker switch with a front protection cap
particularly suitable to be used in electric or electronic

appliances and designed to operate in surroundings
with a high degres of humidity and/or in

the presence of liquids, and where said protection
cap comprises a first framework-shaped element (16)

of rigid material and a second element (17) of soft
material preferably transparent, characterized in

that said second soft element (17) is moulded over
said first rigid element (16) so as to form one

single piece, in that the first rigid element (16)
has integral coupling teeth (18) to engage the protection

cape to the switch body, and in that the
second soft element (17) totally cover said first

rigid element (16) and is provided with a perimetric
base lip (19) designed to function as a sucker on

the surface of a wall in which the switch is flush
mounted for use.
