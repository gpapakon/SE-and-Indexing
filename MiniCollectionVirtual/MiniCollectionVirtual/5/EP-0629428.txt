<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a filter element for filtering of 
gases such as air. The element is characterized in that it 

consists of a light outer box-shaped casing of combustible 
material (2) such as cardboard having two partly open opposing 

sides, within which casing one or more containers (3) of 
combustible material such as plastics for housing the 

active sorbant pellets are arranged, the container walls 
being perforated for percolation of the gases, for example 

air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter element for 
filtering of gases such as air. It is particularly suited 
for filtering of air in connection with the production of 
cellulose. Air filters are commonly known. They may be made of 
different materials and for example consist of a filter for 
removing only particles. Exception for the solid or liquid 
particles, (these filters do not change the composition of 
the air) . These filters can often be sufficient, though 
for a higher degree of purification they are only used as 
a pre-filter. For filtering of different gaseous components the air or 
gas is often allowed to pass through a pre-filter and 
thereafter a sorption filter which usually consists of 
granules and which has the ability to sorb non-desired 
gaseous components. One example of such sorption filters 
may consist of pellets of aluminium oxide, possibly 
impregnated with potassium permanganate. This type of 
sorption filter can be used for removing for example 
sulphur compounds, ethylene, ammonia and formaldehyde. 
Active carbon is also one example of such sorption filters.  
 During operation the sorption filter granules must be 
contained in some kind of container which permits gas 
percolation. These containers usually consist of plates and 
the containers are typically stacked on each other in a 
cabinet. Coupling of the air streams both in series and 
parallel will then be possible. After the chemical filter or sorption filter, further 
filters may also be present for entrapping possible broken 
off particles from the chemical filter. These type of filter or combinations thereof and other 
filters can be used both in industry and in other fields of 
activity. It is especially important that some industries 
obtain clean air or that the air is cleaned from impurities 
which derive from the production. An example thereof is the 
paper and pulp industry where corroding and foul- smelling 
sulphur compounds are responsible for a vast number of 
costly operation interruptions. All filters must be cleaned or exchanged sooner or later. 
The problem with particle filters is the clogging and 
therefore the pressure fall through the filter is measured 
to obtain a measure of the clogging. Also chemical filters 
must be regenerated in some way and chemical samples are 
therefore taken to determine when exchange or regeneration 
should occur. The chemical filters usually consist, as said 
above, of granules of different kind and it is therefore 
necessary with the chemical filters at present

<CLAIMS>
Filter element for filtering of gases such as air 
including an outer box-shaped casing,
characterized
 in that the casing consists of 
a light, combustible material such as cardboard and having 

two wholly or partly open opposing sides in which casing 
one or more box-shaped and closed containers (3) of 

combustible material such as plastics containing active 
sorbant pellets are arranged, which containers (3) 

correspond with their longer sides to the longer side of 
the outer box-shaped casing (2), the container walls being 

perforated for percolation of the gases, for example air. 
Filter element according to claim 1,
characterized
 in that the containers (3) in 
section are arranged in a V-form and that the gases are 

intended to flow into the V and out through the containers 
(3). 
Filter element according to any of the claims 1 or 
2, 
characterized
 in that the pellets consist 
of aluminium oxide impregnated with potassium permanganate.
