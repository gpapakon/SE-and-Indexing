R₂ and R₃
independently represent hydrogen atom(s), 
straight and/or branched chain C₁₋₈ alkyl 

group(s), optionally substituted by a dimethylamino 
group, or C₂₋₆ alkenyl or C₃₋₇ cycloalkyl 

group(s) or 
R₂ and R₃
together with the nitrogen atom to which they 
are attached form a 6-membered heterocyclic 

group containing an additional nitrogen atom, 
which latter optionally may bear a phenyl group,

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with a new use of 2-[phenylmethylene]-1-[3'-(amino)-2'-(hydroxy)-propoxy-imino]-cyclohexane 
derivatives. It is known that ketone derivatives of the formula 
 
wherein 
R9 and R10independently stand for hydrogen atom(s), 
halogen atom(s), lower alkoxy group(s) or R9 and R10together form a methylenedioxy group, R7 and R8both represent hydrogen or R7 and R8together form a chemical bond, R4 and R5independently from each other mean hydrogen 
atom(s), straight or branched chain saturated 
or unsaturated C1-12 alkyl group(a), optionally 
substituted by a dialkylaminoalkyl, dimethoxyphenyl 
or phenyl group, or C3-7 cycloalkyl 
group(s) or R4 and R5together with the nitrogen atom to which they 
are attached form a 4 to 7 membered heterocyclic 
group comprising optionally an additional oxygen, 
sulfur or nitrogen atom and the additional  
 
nitrogen atom optionally may bear a phenyl, 
benzyl or C1-3 alkyl group, and optionally the 
latter substituents may be substituted by a 
hydroxyl group or 1 or 2 methoxy group(s), halogen 
atom(s) or trifluoromethyl group(s) 
or R4 and R5together with the nitrogen atom to which they 
are attached form a piperidine ring optionally 
containing a double bond and optionally substituted 
by a phenyl or benzyl group, R6stands for a hydrogen atom or a benzoyl group 
and nis 3, 4, 5 or 6,  
possess antianginal and/or antiarrhythmic, gastric secretion 
inhibiting, local anaesthetic, tranquillo-sedative, antiinflammatory, 
analgetic and, in some cases, calcium antagonist effects 
(published GB Patent application 2,235,198) the gastric 
secretion inhibiting effect having been indicated only for 
the compounds R,S-2-(E)-phenylmeteylene-1-(E)-[3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-2'-hydroxy-propoxyimino]-cyclohexane
