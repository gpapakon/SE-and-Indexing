<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to endless coated abrasive 
articles and to their method of manufacture. In 
particular, the invention relates to spiral wound 
abrasive belts. Endless coated abrasive articles, such as belts, 
sleeves, tubes and the like, are used in a variety of 
abrading operations thus requiring that they be made 
and supplied by the coated abrasive manufacturer in a 
large variety of widths and circumferences. Coated abrasive belts in most instances are only 
as wide as the coated abrasive material from which they 
are manufactured. In the manufacture of these belts, a 
piece of coated abrasive material, equal in width to 
the desired belt width, is cut at a suitable angle to 
its longitudinal direction. In a direction lengthwise, 
a length equal to the desired belt circumference plus 
an allowance for forming a lap joint, if such a joint 
is to be formed, is measured off. A second cut is then 
made at the same angle as the first. To at least one 
of the cut ends, after skiving, adhesive composition is 
applied and the ends are then joined by overlapping and 
are caused to adhere to one another by means well known 
to those skilled in the art. Alternatively, the piece 
of coated abrasive material may be cut to length 
without the allowance for overlap and the cut ends are 
butted and joined to one another with an overlapping 
reinforcing flexible patch suitably adhered to the 
backside of the two ends of the abrasive material. EP-A-0497451 discloses a further method of making 
an endless abrasive belt comprising an abrasive layer 
supported on a flexible backing material, which 
flexible backing material comprises a flexible support  
 
and a layer of hot-melt adhesive, the method comprising 
the steps of: 
(a) forming complementary ends on an elongate 
strip of said flexible backing material, (b) placing said complementary ends in abutting 
engagement, (c) applying pressure and heat over the area of 
the abutting ends sufficient to cause the hot-melt 
adhesive to flow across the abutment, and (d) allowing said area to cool whereby the hot-melt 
adhesive forms a continuous layer over the 
abutting ends,    the layer of hot-melt adhesive having sufficient 
strength to maintain the integrity of the belt. This process of abrasive belt manufacture, as one 
can readily observe, is limited in the maximum width of 
endless belt that can be manufactured to the maximum 
width of available coated abrasive material. Various 
attempts, as hereinafter more fully discussed, have 
been made to provide
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of making an endless abrasive belt 
comprises the steps of: 


a) providing a strip of abrasive material 
comprising an abrasive layer bonded to a flexible 

backing material, which flexible backing material 
comprises a flexible support and a layer of hot-melt 

adhesive, 
b) winding the strip of abrasive material around 
a mandrel in a spiral configuration such that the edges 

of the strip of adjacent turns of the.spiral are in 
abutting engagement, 
c) maintaining said spiral configuration and 
heating the strip of abrasive material to a temperature 

sufficient to cause the hot-melt adhesive to flow 
across the abutted edges, 
d) maintaining said spiral configuration and 
allowing the strip of abrasive material to cool. 

whereby the hot-melt adhesive forms a continuous layer 
over the abutted edges and the strip of abrasive 

material is bonded to form a tube, and, optionally 
e) converting the tube from step d) to form one 
or more endless abrasive belts. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 in which the 
flexible backing material comprises two flexible 

support layers with the layer of hot-melt adhesive 
between said support layers. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in which 
the flexible support layer(s) comprise(s) woven webs. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the hot-melt adhesive has a melting point of at 

least 120°C. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 in which the hot-melt 
adhesive has a melting point of at least 220°C. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the hot-melt adhesive is a polyurethane adhesive. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which each end of the abrasive strip is secured to the 

mandrel by adhesive tape to maintain the spiral 
configuration. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in 

which the mandrel has a diameter of not more than 60mm. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the width of the abrasive strip is about the same 

as the diameter of the mandrel. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which the abutting edges are covered with adhesive tape 

prior to the heating and the adhesive tape is removed 
after cooling.
