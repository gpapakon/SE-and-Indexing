<ABSTRACT>
A differential voltage-current converter has two input transistors (T1, T2) 
and two cross-coupled transistors (T3, T4) arranged in a translinear loop, the difference 

voltage across the emitter resistors (10, 12) of the cross-coupled transistors (T3, T4) 
being equal to the difference voltage across the input terminals (2, 4). The difference 

current through the cross-coupled transistors (T3, T4) is replicated in the output 
transistors (T5, T6), thereby enabling a larger output signal amplitude to be obtained. In 

order to increase the permissible input voltage the bases of the cross-coupled transistors 
(T3, T4) are coupled to the input transistors (T1, T2) 
via
 emitter-followers (T7 ,T8). 
By connecting the collectors of the emitter-followers (T7, T8) to the collectors of the 

output transistors (T5, T6) a compensation is obtained for the decreasing current gain at 
high frequencies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention as defined in the appended claim relates to a voltage-current converter for converting an 
input voltage into an output current, comprising: 
a first and a second input terminal for receiving the input voltage; a first and a second 
output terminal for supplying the output current; a first, a second, a third and a fourth 
transistor, each having a control electrode, a first main electrode and a second main 
electrode, the control electrode of the first transistor being coupled to the first input 
terminal, the control electrode of the second transistor being coupled to the second input 
terminal, the first main electrode of the first transistor being coupled to the second main 
electrode of the third transistor, the first main electrode of the second transistor being 
coupled to the second main electrode of the fourth transistor, the control electrode of 
the third transistor being coupled to the first main electrode of the second transistor, and 
the control electrode of the fourth transistor being coupled to the first main electrode of 
the first transistor; a first resistor connected between the first main electrode of the third transistor and the 
first main electrode of the fourth transistor; and at least one first current source coupled 
to the first main electrodes of the third transistor and the fourth transistor, a fifth and a sixth transistor, each having a control electrode, a first main electrode and 
a second main electrode, the control electrode of the fifth transistor being coupled to the 
first main electrode of the first transistor, the control electrode of the sixth transistor 
being coupled to the first main electrode of the second transistor, the second main

the first main electrode of the sixth transistor; and at least one second current source 
coupled between the first main electrodes of the fifth transistor and the sixth transistor. Such a voltage-current converter is known from United States Patent No. 
4,456,887. Owing to the cross-coupled third and fourth transistors in series with the 
first and the second transistor a replica of the input voltage is obtained across the first  
 
resistor. A difference current flowing through the first resistor is available on the 
second main electrodes of the
