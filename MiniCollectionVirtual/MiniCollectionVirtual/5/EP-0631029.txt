<ABSTRACT>
A key-operated cylinder lock includes a rotor casing (2); 
a rotor (3) having a key inserting channel (3a), which is

 
rotatably arranged in the rotor casing (2); a permanent magnet (6) 

provided in the rotor (3) near the key inserting channel (3a); a 

magnetic detecting element (7) provided in the rotor casing (2) in such 
a manner that the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet (6) acts on 

the magnetic detecting element (7); a magnetic shutter (4) swingably 
provided in the rotor (3) in such a manner as to open and close the 

key inserting channel (3a), the shutter (4) being made of a magnetic 
material and adapted to interrupt the application of the 

magnetic flux of the permanent magnet (6) to the magnet detecting 
element (7) when the shutter (4) is swung to a channel closing position 

to close the key inserting channel (3a) by a key (30) inserted into the 
key inserting channel (3a); and a spring member (20) provided in the 

rotor (3), which is adapted to urge the shutter (4) towards the channel 
closing position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a key-operated cylinder lock
having a function of detecting the presence and absence of the
key and more specifically to a key-operated cylinder lock according to the preamble portion of claim 1.A key-operated cylinder lock, for instance, for an
automobile door has not been put in practical use yet which
includes a detecting device for electrically detecting whether
the key is inserted into the rotor of the cylinder lock or it
is removed therefrom; i.e., the presence or absence of the key.A key-operated cylinder lock of this type is liable to
be adversely affected by external conditions, because it is
mounted on the outer surface of a vehicle; that is, it is
exposed outside. Hence, it is, in general, difficult for the
key-operated cylinder lock to have a detecting device for
electrically detecting the presence or absence of the key. On
the other hand, it is not always impossible to provide such a
detecting device for the key-operated cylinder lock; however,
the detecting device thus provided is unavoidably intricate in
structure and bulky. A key-operated cylinder lock according to the preamble of claim 1 is known from
EP-A1-0 525 730. This prior art cylinder lock has a cylindrical main portion which is
covered by a casing cover and which furthermore accommodates a magnetic flux
detecting element and is arranged radially inside the casing cover which results in a
rather bulky main portion and, thus, in a large diameter of the cylinder lock.In view of the foregoing, the object of the invention is to provide a key-operated cylinder
lock of the type mentioned above which allows to precisely detect the absence or
presence of a key and which is still compact in size and can be assembled easily.This technical problem is solved by a key-operated cylinder lock according to claim 1.The very specific design of the rotor casing and the arrangement of the casing cover and
magnetic flux detecting element provides a smaller diameter key cylinder and, moreover,
facilitates the assembly of the key-operated cylinder lock because the magnetic flux
detecting element can be mounted on the rotor casing independently of the casing
cover. In the key-operated cylinder lock, it is preferable
that in the case where a rotor cover is provided on the front
end portion of the rotor, the rotor cover is made of a non-magnetic
material. Furthermore, it is preferable that, in the
case where a casing cover is provided on the front end portion
of the rotor casing, the casing cover is made of a non-magnetic
material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A key-operated cylinder lock comprising:

a rotor casing (12) having a cylindrical main portion (12a), an engaging portion
(12b) upon which is mounted a casing cover (22), said engaging portion (12b)

being extended forwardly from the cylindrical main portion (12a) and larger in
diameter than the cylindrical main portion (12a), and a portion having an

accommodating recess (23) at an outer periphery of the rotor casing (12), said
accommodating recess (23) opening backwardly only;
a rotor (14) having a key inserting channel (13) which is rotatably arranged in
the rotor casing (12);
a permanent magnet (21) provided in the rotor (14) near the key inserting
channel (13);
a magnetic flux detecting element (25) provided in said accommodating recess
(23) in such a manner that the magnetic flux of the permanent magnet acts on

the magnetic flux detecting element;
a magnetic shutter (17) swingably provided in the rotor (14) in such manner as
to open and close a key inserting channel (13) by inserting and removing the

key, the shutter (17) being made of a magnetic material and adapted to
interrupt the application of magnetic flux of said permanent magnet (21) to the

magnetic flux detecting element (25) when the shutter is swung to a channel
opening position; and
a spring member (20) provided in said rotor (14) and adapted to urge the
shutter towards the channel closing position,
characterized in that
the portion having the accommodating recess (23) is located behind the
engaging portion (12b) and near the permanent magnet (21),
whereas the casing cover (22) is mounted on the front end portion of the rotor
casing (12).
Key-operated cylinder lock as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a sealing
member (26) for sealing the magnetic detecting element (25) in the

accommodating recess (23).
Key-operated cylinder lock as claimed in claim 2, wherein the sealing member
(26) includes a sealing resin.
Key-operated cylinder lock as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, further
comprising a rotor cover (15) on the front end portion of the rotor (14), the rotor

cover being made of a non-magnetic material.
Key-operated cylinder lock as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
casing cover (22) on the front end portion of the rotor casing is made of a non-magnetic

material.
