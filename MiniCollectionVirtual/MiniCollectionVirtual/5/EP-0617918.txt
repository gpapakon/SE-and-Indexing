An apparatus for signal analysis in the event of a
circulation deficiency in the heart by means of

measurement electrodes to record the variation in
electrical potential of cardiac excitation over

time with at least three implantable electrodes (2,
3, 4), wherein in the position of use, two of the

electrodes can be placed with their poles (6, 7) in
the heart (8) and the third electrode can be placed

with its pole (9) outside the heart (8) in such a
way that the connecting lines of the three poles

(6, 7, 9) form a triangle which surrounds a part of
the heart, wherein a store (12) is provided to

record and store the variation in electrical
potential of a normal heartbeat over time as a

reference value, and the later measurements can be
compared with the stored reference value, that the

electrodes (2, 3, 4) are connected with a likewise-implantable
evaluation and control apparatus (10)

for measuring the potential, in each case, between
two connected electrodes on the one hand and the

third electrode on the other hand, wherein in each
case the potential difference between one of the

electrodes and the two other electrodes can be
measured and the signal variation can be supplied

to the evaluation and control apparatus (10), and
that the evaluation and control apparatus (10) is

configured for such selective connection of two of
the three electrodes so that three derivation

configurations may result.
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the evaluation and control apparatus (10)
contains a microprocessor (11) to effect control

and the associated store (12) for storing 
measurement data which serves as reference values.
An apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the polar correlation, in each case with
changeable connection of two rotating poles, can

especially be altered in each case after one or
more heartbeats.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that
 the electrodes (2, 3, 4; 30)
are connected with an implantable defibrillator

and/or cardiac pacemaker, which is configured as a
generator unit and which is provided with the

control apparatus (10).
An apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterised in
that
 the evaluation and control apparatus (10) is a
part of the cardiac pacemaker and/or the

defibrillator.
An apparatus according to claim 4, 
characterised in
that
 the pole (9) of the implantable electrode (4)
outside the heart (8) is the housing or a

connection with the housing of the generator unit.
An apparatus according to claim 6, 
characterised in
that
 the generator housing has, or contains, an
acoustic signal transmitter which can be triggered

by measurement of a circulation deficiency or
arrhythmia.
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 7,

characterised in that
 the control apparatus (10) is
coupled with a medicament pump and that the pump

can be switched on by measurement of a circulation

deficiency and/or arrhythmia. 
An apparatus according to one of claims 1 to 8,

characterised in that
 it contains a timer which
triggers measurements at the electrodes in a

specific, pre-determined time rhythm.
An apparatus according to claim 4 or 5,

characterised in that
 the evaluation and control
apparatus (10) is coupled with the cardiac

pacemaker or defibrillator in such a way that
electrical impulses are supplied to the electrode

poles on occurrence of arrhythmia.
An apparatus according to one of claims 2 to 10,

characterised in that
 the evaluation and control
apparatus (10) has multiplexers (13) connected with

the electrodes to switch the individual electrodes
in each case selectively to two summing amplifiers

(14) the outputs (15) of which are connected to an
analogue-digital converter (16), and that the

analogue-digital converter (16) is connected to the
microprocessor (11).
