<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor device, and more 
specifically to a semiconductor device containing an integrated circuit 
chip packaged in a flip-chip bonding and having a novel structure suitable 
to be mounted and connected to a microstrip line structure. At present, high-speed information network systems and satellite 
communication systems are being rapidly developed, and therefore, a 
demand for a semiconductor device operating in a high frequency band 
such as UHF (ultrahigh frequency), SHF(superhigh frequency) and EHF 
(extremely high frequency) is now increasing. On the other hand, FET 
(field effect transistor), in particular, MESFET (metal semiconductor 
FET) and HEMT (high electron mobility transistor) formed of a 
compound semiconductor typified by GaAs, are expected as a device 
capable of breaking down a limitation in characteristics of silicon bipolar 
transistors conventionally used in the high frequency band, and practical 
use of these elements is being promoted.  It has been confirmed that high frequency IC (integrated circuit) 
chips including GaAsFETs have an extremely high performance. 
However, packaged or encapsulated high frequency integrated circuit 
chips cannot, in many cases, exert the excellent performance of the IC 
chips themselves. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a 
packaged semiconductor device which has overcome the above mentioned 
defect of the conventional one. Another object of the present invention is to provide a packaged 
semiconductor device capable of exerting an excellent performance of the 
integrated circuit chips themselves without being impaired. The above and other objects of the present invention are achieved in 
accordance with the present invention by a package semiconductor device 
comprising:
 
   an insulating substrate having a first surface formed with a plurality 
of connection pads and a second surface formed with a plurality of 
external connection members each of which is electrically connected to a 
corresponding one of the connection pads through a via hole formed 
through the insulating substrate;
 
   an integrated circuit chip bonded facedown on the first surface of 
the insulating substrate so that the integrated circuit chip is electrically 
connected to the connection pads through solder bumps, the integrated 
circuit chip having a back electrode formed on a back surface thereof; and
 
 
   an electrically conductive cap covered on the first surface of the 
insulating substrate so
