<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solution for
preserving contact lenses for shipping and a method for
preserving contact lenses for shipping employing it.Most of conventional contact lenses, particularly
oxygen-permeable hard contact lenses contain silicon
components. Accordingly, the surface of the contact
lenses tends to be hydrophobic, and wettability is poor
when they are firstly worn, whereby comfortableness in
wearing tends to be poor, or satisfactory vision is less
likely to be obtained.Accordingly, to keep the surface water wettability of
said oxygen-permeable hard contact lenses, after they are
produced until they are worn by patients, they are
preserved as wet for shipping, by e.g. subjecting them to
a surface treatment, or preliminarily immersing them in a
preserving solution for shipping such as physiological 
saline.However, in the case where contact lenses are
preserved as wet for shipping by using e.g. physiological
saline, there is a possibility that the base curve which
is one of important specifications of contact lenses may
change during the process for shipping.Further, a surfactant is usually incorporated to many
of conventional preserving solutions for shipping.
Accordingly, a change in size of a contact lens such as
the change in the base curve is likely to take place.Under these circumstances, the present invention has
been made, and it is an object of the present invention
to provide a solution for preserving contact lenses for
shipping, which significantly reduces a change in the
base curve while contact lenses, particularly oxygen-permeable
contact lenses, are preserved as wet for
shipping, and a method for preserving contact lenses for
shipping employing it.The present invention relates to (1) a solution for
preserving contact lenses for shipping, which consists essentially of a
polyvinyl pyrrolidone having a weight average molecular
weight of from 500 to 200,000, and which contains no
surfactant; (2) a solution for preserving contact lenses
for shipping, which consists essentially of 0.2 to 3 w/v% of a
polyvinyl pyrrolidone having a weight average molecular
weight of from 500 to 200,000 and a K value of from 20 to
100, from 0.000005 to 0.0002 w/v% of a polyhexamethylene 
biguanide and from 0.02 to 0.3 w/v% of
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetate, or a hydrate of sodium
ethylenediaminetetraacetate,
and (3) a method for preserving contact
lenses for shipping, which comprises immersing contact
lenses in the above-mentioned solution (1) or
