Processes and apparatus for combusting fluid 
fuel, e.g., liquid fuel, in at least two combustion 

zones, wherein the fluid fuel from port (13) is partially combusted 
with a fluid fuel atomizing or dispersing fluid from passage (19)

completely combusted with oxidant from passage (27) in at least one 

subsequent combustion zone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus
useful for combusting fluid fuel, e.g, liquid fuel, and
the process for carrying out the same.Various burners have been used in industrial
furnaces to melt glass forming ingredients or metals,
to incinerate waste or to combust chemical reactants.
Generally, these burners comprise a passageway for
ejecting fuel and a passageway for emitting oxidant, as
shown by, for example; U.S. Patent No. 5,104,310 and
Brazilian Patent No. 8,503,088. The fuel is normally
atomized with pressurized air, pressurized steam or
mechanical fuel atomizing means and combusted with a
substantial amount of oxidant. For example, FR-A-1 374 518
discloses a liquid fuel burner comprising an elongated body having an
inner passageway, a housing means surrounding said elongated body to
form an annular passageway therebetween and a venturi disposed within
the annular passageway surrounding the exit end of the elongated body.
Fuel is passed through the inner passageway and exits through a plurality
of bores oriented at an angle to the central axis of the burner. Air is
supplied trough the annular passageway. A portion of the air flows
through the venturi and thus entrains the fuel exiting the said bores,
whereby the fuel is atomized. When the oxidant
employed is either an oxygen enriched air or
technically pure oxygen rather than air, the combustion
efficiency may be enhanced. Much less energy, for
example, may be needed for handling oxygen enriched air
or pure oxygen since oxygen enriched air or pure oxygen
contains less inert nitrogen than does air for an
equivalent amount of oxygen. However, the pure oxygen
or oxygen enriched air is known to increase the
combustion temperature. Thus, failure to control the
combustion temperature and flame length resulting from
using the pure oxygen or oxygen enriched air can damage
the burners and/or their associated furnaces.Moreover, an unsafe condition may be created if fuel,
such as oil, is allowed to flow into a passageway which 
is used for emitting oxidant. The oil in the oxygen
pipe, for example, can lead to an explosion since it
can be ignited in the presence of oxygen. Therefore,
there is a genuine need for apparatus and processes,
which are useful for mitigating or alleviating such
problems.One aspect of the present invention relates
to a process for controlling the combustion temperature
and flame length produced by a burner through
combusting fluid fuel in at least two combustion zones.
This combustion process comprises:
(a) ejecting at least
