<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetization processing 
apparatus to magnetize an object material by applying 
a magnetic field thereto, and particularly to a magnetic 
circuit therefor. There are methods of modifying the properties of liquid 
materials such as water and oil by applying a strong magnetic 
field thereto, thereby causing them to absorb magnetic 
energy. For example, an attempt of improving the combustion 
efficiency by causing nuclear magnetic resonance in hydrocarbon 
fuel oils, and an attempt to make it easier to remove 
impurities from contaminated water by applying a strong magnetic 
field thereto in the pre-treatment process have been 
proposed by the present applicant. In order to change the 
chemical properties of a liquid material composed of a 
hydrogen compound by applying a magnetic field thereto, it 
is necessary to apply a strong magnetic field of 10,000 
gauss or higher intensity for a relatively long period of 
time. Therefore, such a magnetization processing requires a  
 
magnetic circuit capable of applying a constant strong 
magnetic field to the liquid material to be processed for a 
long period of time. However, such a magnetic circuit composed 
of permanent magnet as meets this purpose, namely that 
generates a strong magnetic field in an open section of the 
magnetic field wherein the liquid material to be processed 
exists for a long period of time without loss has not been 
available. Major object of the invention is to provide a magnetic 
circuit composed of permanent magnet capable of generating a 
strong magnetic field for a long period of time in an open 
section of a magnetic path which is a place where magnetization 
processing takes place, and a magnetization processing 
apparatus which uses the magnetic circuit. Another object of the invention is to provide a magnetic 
circuit composed of permanent magnet capable of applying 
a strong magnetic field to an object material for a long 
period of time while preventing the magnetic force from 
leaking, and a magnetization processing apparatus which uses 
the magnetic circuit. Further another object of the invention is to provide a 
magnetic circuit capable of preventing the magnetic force of 
the permanent magnet from decreasing due to magnetic leakage,  
 
and a magnetization processing apparatus which uses the 
magnetic circuit. The magnetic circuit of permanent magnet of the invention 
to apply magnetization processing to the object material 
has no opening of the magnetic path except for a section 
wher
