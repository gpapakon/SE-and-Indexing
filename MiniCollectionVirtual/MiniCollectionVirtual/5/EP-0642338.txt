<DESCRIPTION>
The class of compounds known as monoamine oxidase (MAO) 
inhibitors have long been utilized for the treatment of 
depression. MAO is an enzyme which plays an important role 
in the metabolic regulation of naturally occurring 
monoamines. MAO catalyzes the biodegradation of monoamines 
through oxidative deamination. Among the physiologically 
active monoamines which are known substrates for MAO are: 
(a) the so-called "neurotransmitter" monoamines, such as 
the catecholamines (e.g. dopamine, epinephrine and 
norepinephrine) and the indoleamines (e.g. tryptamine and 
5-hydroxytryptamine), (b) the so-called "trace" amines 
(e.g. o-tyramine, phenethylamine, tele-N-methylhistamine) 
and (c) tyramine. Biochemical and pharmacological studies indicate that 
the MAO enzyme exists in two forms known as "MAO Type A" 
(MAO-A) and "MAO Type B" (MAO-B). The two forms differ in 
their distribution in body organs, in their substrate 
specificity and in their sensitivity to inhibitors. In 
general, MAO-A selectively oxidizes the so-called 
"neurotransmitter" monoamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine  
 
and 5-hydroxytryptamine), while MAO-B selectively oxidizes 
the "trace" monoamines (o-tyramine, phenethylamine and 
tele-N-methylhistamine). Both MAO-A and MAO-B oxidize 
tyramine, tryptamine and dopamine. However, in man, 
dopamine has been shown to be a preferred substrate for 
MAO-B. MAO-A and MAO-B also differ in their sensitivity to 
inhibition, and thus can be selectively inhibited depending 
upon the chemical structure of the inhibitor and/or the 
relative concentrations of the inhibitor and the enzyme. 
It should be observed that the "selectivity" of an MAO 
inhibitor arises because the inhibitor has a greater 
affinity for one form of the enzyme over the other. Thus 
the selectivity or an inhibitor for MAO-A or MAO-B will be 
dose-dependent, selectivity being lost as the concentration 
of inhibitor is increased. For example, L-deprenyl is a 
selective inhibitor of MAO-B in vivo at lower doses but 
becomes a non-selective inhibitor of both MAO-A and MAO-B 
as the dose is increased. There is now evidence that patients with Alzheimer's 
disease have higher cerebral MAO-B activity than healthy, 
elderly people. Monoamines are known to play a fundamental 
role in the cognitive processes linked to memory and 
learning, and it has been shown that patients with 
Alzheimer's disease have reduced activity of different 
neurotransmission systems mediated by monoamines such as 
dopamine, noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine.
