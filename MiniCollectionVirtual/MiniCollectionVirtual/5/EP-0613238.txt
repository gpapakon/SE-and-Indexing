<ABSTRACT>
The transistor of an output stage having an emitter 
connected to the supply rail and a collector connected 

to the output node of the stage may be protected 
against the effects of accidental shortcircuiting of 

the output node of the stage with the positive pole of 
a battery while the circuit is unpowered, by a protection 

transistor of the same type of said output transistor 
to be protected and having an emitter connected to 

the base of the output transistor, a collector connected 
to the output node of the stage and a base connected 

through a biasing resistance to the supply rail 
on the stage. The protection transistor may be formed 

within the same pocket containing an interdigitated 
structure of the output power transistor, thus reducing 

the area requirement for the protection device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power amplifier
of an apparatus that may be connected and powered by a
battery of a DC supply, provided with means for
preventing destructive breakdown that may be
accidentally caused by inadvertently connecting the DC
supply to the output terminal of the amplifier while
the latter is unpowered.The document EP-0382906-A2 discloses a Darlington transistors stage
that includes a diode for protecting the stage against supply overvoltages
and against applications of a supply voltage of wrong polarity. During the installation of apparatuses containing
power amplifiers, destructive breakdown events caused
by inadvertently making erroneous connections of the
apparatus to the local DC supply are frequent. The most
typical instance is the installation of audio
amplifiers, radio receivers, cassette and CD players on
vehicles.The output terminals of power amplifiers are normally
provided with some sort of protection against
accidental shortcircuits that may inadvertently be
caused either toward ground potential or toward the DC
supply voltage. However, there are still instances of
failures on the field, for which a specific protection
has not yet been devised.Among these remaining accidental causes of failure
there is a condition commonly known as "short-to-plus-unpowered"
or more simply by the acronym SPU. Such a
condition that may occur during the installation of an
apparatus on a vehicle, is schematically depicted in
Fig. 1. The accidental cause is an inadvertent connection
to the positive pole of the battery (Vbatt) of the
vehicle, of the output terminal (Out) of the amplifier
(Amp), instead of correctly connecting the supply terminal
(Vcc) to the positive pole of the battery (Vbatt). 
This may happen when the isolated cable coming from the
positive pole of the vehicle's battery is connected by
error to the output terminal of the card that contains
the amplifier. In practice, the output terminal (Out)
of the amplifier becomes connected to ground through a
filter capacitor C1 that commonly is present on the
amplifier card (typically of about a thousand ÂµF) and
through an equivalent resistance toward ground R1 of
the rest of the circuit on the card (typically in the
order of 10 ohms).When such an accidental connection of the output terminal
(Out) of the circuit to the positive node (Vbatt)
of the local battery (e.g. of the vehicle), the circuit
comes to be "powered" through its output node. Current
flows toward ground both through the ground terminal
(Gnd) of the amplifier as
