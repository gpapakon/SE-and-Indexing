<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for packing coated 
containers, in particular reagent-treated test tubes 
for analytical determination, especially test tubes for 
immunological assay methods using immobilised reactants 
of such assay methods, and a packaging unit containing 
a large number of test tubes of the stated type. Immunological assay methods frequently employ test 
tubes which have on their walls, in immobilised form, 
some substance (reactant) which is important for 
carrying out the assay method successfully, for example 
immobilised antibodies, immobilised antigens and 
specific immunoglobulins or other protein materials, 
and which are usually present in a protective matrix of 
an auxiliary substance forming a film on the walls of 
the test tubes (coated tubes). After their production,  
 
such test tubes must be packed in such a way that the 
frequently sensitive immobilised reactants retain their 
activity over as long periods as possible and reliable 
results can be obtained when the test tubes are used. 
This usually necessitates packing which guarantees 
reliable protection from moisture, dust and other 
contaminants. At present, such test tubes are usually 
packed by a procedure in which they are transferred 
from the trays into packaging containers, such as 
cartons or bags, to which bags containing a drying 
agent (silica gel bags) must be added in the case of 
sensitive substances or in the case of particular 
quality requirements, in order to regulate the moisture 
content in the pack. Such packagings have, inter alia, 
the disadvantage that, when a pack containing a large 
number of such test tubes is opened, the tubes are 
exposed to the effect of the surrounding atmosphere, 
which may result in test tubes which are not 
immediately used relatively rapidly becoming useless 
after the pack has been opened. In order to avoid 
this, in such packs all test tubes would additionally 
have to be individually sealed, entailing an additional 
packaging cost. It is the object of the present invention to provide a 
method leading to a novel packaging unit, for packing 
containers coated with sensitive or optionally also 
volatile substances, such as test tubes for analytical 
methods, in particular immunological assay methods, 
which method permits rapid and safe automated packing 
of such containers or test tubes and ensures reliable 
protection of the tubes from moisture, dust and 
contamination of the individual unused tubes even after 
the total pack has been opened.

<CLAIMS>
Method for packing reagent-treated test tubes 
for analytical determinations, in particular for 

immunological assay methods using immobilised reactants 
of such assay methods, characterised in that 


a large number of such test tubes (1) are arranged 
in a group so that the edges (2) of the openings of all 

test tubes (1) are essentially in a plane, 
a label (3) is provided which has a central area 
(4), which corresponds approximately to the total base 

area occupied by the group of test tubes, and an edge 
region (5) and is provided with an adhesive coating, 
the label (3) is applied with the side having the 
adhesive coating to the edges (2) of the openings so 

that it adheres to all test tubes (1) of the group and 
seals the said test tubes, 
the label (3) with the group of test tubes (1)

top area of the container (6), closes the open top area 

and has an adhesive coating facing the interior of the  
 

container and

bonded via the edes of their openings to the adhesive 

side of the label (3) and are sealed by the latter. 
Packaging unit according to Claim 10,

characterised in that the edge region (5) of the label 

(3) is adhesively bonded in the region of the open top 
area to the outer lateral surfaces of the container 

(6), and the lateral surfaces of the container (6) have 
a score line (8) running all around or a tear thread 

running all around, each of which permits the container 
edge bonded to the edge region (5) of the label (3) to 

be separated from the remainder of the container (6).
