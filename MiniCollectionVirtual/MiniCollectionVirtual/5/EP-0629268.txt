<ABSTRACT>
A slewing mechanism which is particularly suitable for use with a car seat for the physically disabled which permits a combined translational and rotational movement of a plate (6) or the like on which, say, a seat assembly (100) may be mounted. The mechanism comprises a primary arm (1) pivotably connected by a pivot (2) to a support surface and pivotably connected by a pivot (5) to a secondary arm (4) which is pivotably connected to plate (6) by a pivot (7). A first link (8) is pivotably connected by a pivot (81) to the support surface and by a pivot (82) to the secondary arm (4). A second link (9) is pivotably connected by a pivot (91) to the plate (6) and by a pivot (92) to the primary arm (1). The arrangement is such that when the primary arm (1) is pivoted about the pivot (2), the plate (6) is laterally displaced and rotated from its initial position. A lock mechanism is provided to lock the slewing mechanism in a number of positions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a slewing mechanism and in particular
to a mechanism which can effect slewing of a motor vehicle seat
so that it effectively moves forward whilst it rotates so that
a passenger in the seat can be moved from a position in which the
seat is normally located to a position where the seat presents
at or beyond the door sill whilst, at the same time, avoiding
fouling of a door, door pillar or the like.Whilst we will exemplify the invention by reference to a car seat
it is to be understood that the same mechanism is equally
applicable to other applications such as in furniture,
appliances, agricultural machinery and earth moving machinery.
The invention could also be applied to mechanisms in ambulances
and for access by the physically disabled to baths or the like
and these and other applications are incorporated in the
invention.There have previously been proposed mechanisms to enable a person
in a vehicle, whether the driver or passenger, to obtain ingress
and egress notwithstanding the fact that the person concerned has
physical disabilities.In the end result in these previous devices the seat is moveable
from a position where it is conventionally located to a position
where at least the leading edge of the seat extends beyond the
door sill of the vehicle. The previously proposed mechanisms are basically
relatively cumbersome and awkward to use and normally
necessitate the movement on slides, in two directions.
These constructions tend, to be fragile as they often
leave the seat cantilevered on the slides. They can
also be very complex and expensive.Another example is US 4,912,994 which describes a
linkage device which permits rotation of a payload
approximately 180° about the end of a supporting
member. FR 2302065 describes a movable seat which is
pivotally mounted on two spaced arms the other ends of
which are pivotally mounted to a support surface.It is the object of the present invention to
provide a slewing mechanism which operates effectively
to provide both a translation and a rotating movement
which mechanism is rugged in construction but
nevertheless economic to produce, and, in particular,
to provide such a mechanism for use with a vehicle
seat or the like.US 3,253,473 discloses a linkage for the
generation of arcs and curved surfaces which comprises
a first pivot on a support surface, said first pivot
defining a geometrical axis;
a primary arm having a first end and a second
end, said primary arm being rotatable adjacent said
first end about said first pivot;a second

<CLAIMS>
A slewing mechanism comprising:

a first pivot (2) on a support surface (3), said
first pivot (2) defining a geometrical axis;
a primary arm (1) having a first end and a second
end, said primary arm (1) being rotatable adjacent

said first end about said first pivot(2);
a second pivot (5) adjacent said second end of
said primary arm (1), said second pivot (5) being

parallel to said geometrical axis;
a secondary arm (4) having a first end and a
second end, said first end of said secondary arm (4)

being pivotally connected to the second end of the
primary arm (1) at said second pivot (5);
a third pivot (7) adjacent the second end of the
secondary arm (4), said third pivot (7) being parallel

to said geometrical axis;
an upper plate (6) rotatably connected to the
secondary arm (4) at the third pivot (7);
a first link (8) pivotally connected between a
position (81) on the support surface (3) and the first

end (82) of the secondary arm;
a second link (9) pivotally connected between the
second end (92) of the primary arm (1) and the upper

plate (6) at a position (91) thereon;
the arrangement being such that, on movement of
the mechanism, the third pivot is (7) constrained to

effect an arcuate movement but remains parallel to
said geometrical axis, and the upper plate (6) is

constrained to rotate in a geometrical plane
perpendicular to the geometrical axis;

   characterised in that the support surface (3) and
the primary arm (1) are interconnected via a bearing

arrangement including annular bearing races (11,32) 
facing each other and located on parallel substantial

overlapping areas of the support surface (3) and the
primary arm (1), these bearing races (11,32) co-operating

so as to support the primary arm (1)
relative to the support surface (3) and so that a part

of the load transmitted from the primary arm (1) to
the support surface (3) is not transmitted through the

first pivot (2);

   and in that the interconnection of the secondary
arm (4) with the primary arm (1), and that of the

upper plate (6) with the secondary arm (4) is similar
to the manner of connection of the support surface (3)

with the primary arm (1), whereby ready rotation is
permitted notwithstanding substantial asymmetric

cantilever loads on the mechanism.
A slewing mechanism as claimed in claim 1
wherein each of the support surface (3) and the

primary arm (1), and the primary arm (1) and the
secondary arm (4), include coaxial complementary

annular recesses (11,32) in which ball bearings (12)
can be located and a central pivot containing ball

bearings or a ball race (14).

preceding claim having means to lock the mechanism at

effectively any position
A slewing mechanism as claimed in any
preceding claim wherein the mechanism is driven by an

electric, hydraulic or pneumatic motor.

preceding claim having on the upper plate (6) thereof

a vehicle seat (105), said seat being movable between 
a first position at which it is in the normal position

of a seat in a vehicle to a second position where at
least its leading edge extends beyond the vehicle door

with the seat effectively being directed outwardly
relative to the door.
A slewing mechanism as claimed in claim 5
including locking means which can hold the seat in the

normal position.
A slewing mechanism as claimed in claim 6
wherein the locking mechanism automatically locks when

the seat is in the normal position.
A slewing mechanism as claimed in any of
claims 5 or 6 wherein the locking mechanism comprises

an annular member (123) having ratchet teeth (124) on
one side thereof attached to one of the plates (1,4)

or the upper plate (6) which is engaged by a member
(12) having an end formed to be complementary with the

ratchet teeth (124) and which is operated on operation
of the locking mechanism.
A slewing mechanism as claimed in claim 6 or
claim 7 in which the locking mechanism includes a pin

A slewing mechanism as claimed in any one of
claims 6 to 9 wherein the release for the locking

mechanism is accessible to a user when the vehicle
door is open.

the motor is accessible to the user when the vehicle
door is open.
