<ABSTRACT>
Provided is an ignition apparatus for internal 
combustion engines with higher reliability for the 

solder bonding parts. 
The ignition apparatus is composed of a mold case 
having an input-output terminal formed on the mold case 

as a single body, a semiconductor switching device, a 
control circuit board, and a heat sink. On the heat 

sink, single or a plurality of laminated structure is 
used, including the semiconductor switching devices with 

beryllia as an electric insulation plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic 
apparatus used for the internal combustion engine, 
specifically, to a laminated structure in the 
semiconductor switching devices. In the prior art, Beryllia is used for reducing the 
heat generation from the power transistors in order to 
reduce the heat resistance, in which the life-time 
elongation technology for the laminated structure is not 
used and, in some cases, there is no consideration for 
the long-time guarantee to be required for the 
automotive parts. For example, one of this kind of electronic 
apparatus is described in the Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open No. 3-30440(1991). In the prior art apparatus, in order to release 
efficiently the heat generated by the semiconductor 
switching device, Beryllia is selected for the material 
used for the electric insulation plate. In these 
devices, a refractory metal is used for the solder as 
the bonding between the beryllia and the metallic heat 
sink, and the bonding between the semiconductor 
switching devices. In case that the atmospheric  
 
conditional change and the repetitive stress due to the 
self heat generation occur, the stress is applied to the 
solder bonding parts, and the crack arises in the solder 
bonding parts, and consequently, there might be the 
catastrophic breakdown in the solder bonding parts. And 
furthermore, in the prior art, the laminated structure 
is formed in a single module, and the dispersion in the 
structural and material property of the solder bonding 
parts could be made to be as small as possible. However, 
in case that a plurality of laminated layers are formed 
in a single module, what makes problems is that the 
dispersion in the manufacturing quality of the solder 
bonding parts may become greater and the fraction of the 
defective parts may increase. The object of the present invention is to provide 
an ignition apparatus for the inner combustion engine 
with high reliability in its device bonding parts. In the present invention, the material is selected 
so as to be used for the solders for bonding the 
semiconductor switching device and the beryllia, and for 
bonding the beryllia and the metallic heat sink. In 
general, as there may be a case that the temperature due 
to the heat generation by the switching devices reaches 
as high as 100 °C to 350 °C, refractory metal is used 
as the solder. The solder having lower melting point is 
used generally for the bonding under the beryllia so 
that the difference a in the thermal expansion 
coefficient
