<ABSTRACT>
A data storage disk drive array is synchronized using drives (10) 
wherein each has an onboard oscillator (22) assembly which is 

connected either for independent operation of each drive or 
synchronization of all or any selected drives of the array using 

a common or slave sync line (43) that can supply an index signal to 
all or any portion of the drives of the array and is capable of 

using the oscillator assembly of any drive in the synchronized 
array as the source of the common precision index signal. The 

system can also be partitioned in subarrays with synchronization 
of the entire system, of individual subarrays or any mix of 

subarray combinations while retaining the capability for any 
drive of the system to function independent of the 

synchronization of any group of drives within the system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to disk data storage devices
and more particularly to a system wherein multiple disk spindle
assemblies are synchronously rotated with respect to one another
to have the indices coincide or maintain a predetermined or
programmable out-of-phase relationship.A conventional disk drive has a disk carrying spindle
assembly that is closely speed regulated to maintain the
rotational velocity of the disk media. The spindle motor is
accelerated or decelerated in accordance with the phase error
generated by the difference between a reference signal and
rotational disk position feedback from the disk carrying spindle.To obtain enhanced performance drives are commonly rotated
in synchronism with one another. Typical of such synchronized
drives are multiple drives used in a synchronous array system
where data is interleaved to enhance the data rate and
performance or in systems where the latency delay is reduced by
having two mirrored drives synchronized to rotate 180 degrees out
of phase. The synchronism is best accomplished by using a single
source of pulses to define the synchronizing index mark. If data
is used from the disk surface of one drive within the system, an
event that requires recovery by the primary drive also
necessitates secondary recovery by the other drives prior to
reestablishing the synchronized operation thereby compromising
system performance. Another solution is to use an external
oscillator to provide a common source of pulses that is decoded
to produce a single precision index reference. Such a system is
shown and described in US Patent 4,918,544 which uses a single
crystal oscillator to supply the synchronization control circuits 
respectively associated with the drives within the system.
Although this approach affords a control source that could avoid
secondary recovery procedures when any drive in the system loses
synchronized operation, it would require a separate clocking
apparatus or two types of drive apparatus so that a system would
use one unit including the clocking apparatus and other units
without such structure.EP-A-0 426 483 discloses a disk drive subsystem with a plurality of disk drives,
one disk drive comprising the master drive and the other disk drives
being slaved to operate with a predetermined disk position relative
to the disk position of the master drive. EP-A-0 404 120 discloses a plurality of
disk devices, one disk device being a current master disk device for currently supplying
a master synchronisation signal. The disk devices are

A synchronizing control system for an array of disk drive
data storage devices comprising :


an array of disk drives ,
said array of disk drives being partitioned into a
plurality of subarrays (A, B) with each subbarray including

multiple drives (10A, 10B) ;
each said disk drive including a plurality of data storage
disks (13) mounted on a spindle (12) for rotation in unison with the

rotor of a spindle motor (14), an oscillator assembly (22, 24) that
provides a precision index signal (39), spindle motor control

circuit means (28-33) for controlling the rotational velocity of
said spindle motor, synchronizing circuit means (40-44) for

enabling synchronous operation with other of said

precision index signal (39) to said spindle motor control
circuit directly when in one state or through said

synchronizing circuit when in another state, said
synchronizing circuit means including second switch means (42)

which is activated by a selection signal (CI2) to select the oscillator assembly of
that drive as the source of the precision index signal for

other disk drives during synchronous operation;
means connecting the synchronizing circuit means of each
disk drive within an array to a common subarray line (43);
third switch means associated respectively with each
subarray for connecting the said common line (43A, 43B) of the

associated subarray (A, B) to a global common line (54); and
fourth switch means (52A, 52B) associated respectively with each
subarray to selectively connect the said subarray common

line to said global common line, whereby the subarray can
either operate in synchronization with the index signal 

supplied by said global common line or in synchronization
with an index signal generated within said subarray,

whereby one and only one of said oscillator
assemblies is connected to said global common line (54).
