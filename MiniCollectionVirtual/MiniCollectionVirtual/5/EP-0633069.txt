<ABSTRACT>
The painting method comprises a baking process in which 
electrostatic painting powder is scattered uniformly on both 

surfaces of a steel plate, which is subjected to shop primer 
painting or chemical conversion coating treatment after 

being shotblasted or pickled, the unnecessary portions of 
scattered electrostatic painting powder on the steel plate 

is removed by means of a suction nozzle moving under 
numerical control, and thereafter the scattered 

electrostatic painting powder on both surfaces of the steel 
plate is baked by the high-frequency baking method; an 

intermediate assembly block process in which the baked steel 
plate is cut into a predetermined shape under numerical 

control, and a related steel plate is welded to the 

unpainted portion to form an intermediate assembly block; a 
major assembly block process in which a plurality of 

intermediate assembly blocks are welded to each other to 
form a major assembly block; and an integrated assembly 

block process in which the major assembly block is subjected 
to secondary surface treatment by pickling, and thereafter 

secondary painting is performed on the major assembly block 
before forming an integrated assembly block.

<DESCRIPTION>
Ships are usually built through various main processes
as shown in Fig.4.As indicated in Fig.4, (1) steel plates used for a ship
are subjected to (2) primary surface treatment by
shotblasting and then to (3) shop primer painting. The steel
plates are (4) cut and bent, and (5) a block assembly step is
performed comprising intermediate and major assemblies. In
this process, secondary surface treatment, block painting,
and unit painting are performed. In (6) an outfit work step,
secondary surface treatment, inside painting, and bottom
shell painting are performed. Then, the ship is (7)
launched.Considering the painting work in the above main
processes, rust occurring in the ship building process is
prevented by (3) shop primer applied to the entire surface
of the steel plates, and then block painting and unit painting is carried out in
(5) the block assembly step and secondary surface treatment, inside
painting, and bottom shell painting are performed in (6) the outfit work step. However, after the welding operation in (5) block
assembly step and (6) outfit work step performed after shop
primer painting, the shop primer coating damaged in (4)
cutting and bending steel plates must be treated and
painting after welding has been performed. Such work requires
not only very high cost but also heavy labor involving
danger and dirt. It is therefore said that the biggest
problem in securing workers and reducing cost is to improve
the work of this kind in the future ship building operation.
This is true for bridges and offshore structures in addition
to ships.From British patent specification 1 465 146, an electrostatic
powder-coating method for selectively coating a pattern on the
surface of steel plate and an apparatus for carrying out the
method is known which comprises the steps of the pre-characterizing
clause of claim 1. It comprises depositing coating
powders uniformly on the surface of a steel plate and arranging
that the coating powders adhere electrostatically to the article
surface, and selectively removing the deposited powders from the
surface of areas not requiring any powder coating using a force
stronger than the adhesive force between the coated powders and the
steel plate surface. Subsequently, the surface of the steel plate
is heated to form the coating film on the surface areas containing
deposited powders. The coating powders may be scattered
uniformly on the surface and then charged or vice versa. Those
portions of the powder on areas which do not require a coating treatment
may be removed by
