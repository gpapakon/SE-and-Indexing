<ABSTRACT>
In a method for driving an active matrix liquid crystal display 
panel, a selection signal composed of a scan signal superimposed with a 

modulation signal is sequentially supplied to the scan signal lines one by 
one, so as to turn on the thin film transistors connected to the scan signal 

line applied with the selection signal so that a video signal is applied from 
each of the video signal lines through the associated turned-on thin film 

transistor to the corresponding pixel electrode and stored in the 
corresponding storage capacitor, whereby an image is displayed. The 

selection signal is configured to assume a first potential which is a high 
voltage, a second potential which is lower than the first potential, and a 

third potential which is lower than the second potential. The selection 
signal is controlled in a given frame to elevate from the second potential 

to the first potential so that the selection signal is maintained at the first 
potential during one horizontal scan period, and then, to drop to the third 

potential so that the selection signal is maintained at the first potential 
during two horizontal scan periods, and thereafter, to return to the second 

potential so that the selection signal is maintained at the second potential 
until a next frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor integrated circuit
for driving a liquid crystal display panel, and more specifically to a
method for driving an active matrix liquid crystal display panel having a
TFT (thin film transistor) associated to each display element.Liquid crystal display devices have various excellent features in
comparison with other display devices such as a plasma display panel
(PDP) and electrochemical display (ECD). For example, the liquid
crystal display devices is suitable to be driven with a battery cell, since it
needs only as small consumed power as a few microwatts per square
centimeter. In addition, the liquid crystal display devices can be driven
with a semiconductor circuit since it has only an operating voltage on the
order of a few volts. Therefore, these features enable a flat screen
display in combination with a semiconductor integrated circuit.
Furthermore, as a matter of course in the display, a scale-up of the
display size, a high definition and a multi-coloring have been demanded.
To improve a contrast for satisfying these demands, there was proposed
an active matrix display panel using a TFT associated with each of pixels. For example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Publication
JP-A-03-035218 proposes one typical conventional method for driving a
liquid crystal display panel. In this proposed method, for an AC driving
of the liquid crystal display, a DC voltage to be applied is inverted from
one field to another. In addition, each liquid crystal pixel or cell
inevitably has a parasitic capacitance between a pixel electrode and a scan
signal line and a video signal line.Referring to Figure 1, there is shown an equivalent circuit of one
pixel of an active matrix liquid crystal display panel. In the drawing,
Reference Signs Yn-1 and Yn designate a video signal line, and Reference
Signs Xn-1 and Xn designate a scan signal line. These video signal lines
and scan signal lines are arranged to form a matrix plane. At each of
intersections between the video signal lines and the scan signal lines, one
thin film transistor TFT is located. The shown thin film transistor TFT
has a source (or drain) electrode connected to a corresponding video
signal line Yn and a gate electrode connected to a corresponding scan
signal line Xn. A drain (or source) electrode of the shown thin film
transistor TFT is connected to a pixel electrode symbolically with a dot
10. A liquid crystal is sandwiched between this pixel electrode 10 and a
not-shown opposing electrode which is
