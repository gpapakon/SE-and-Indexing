<ABSTRACT>
In order to create a roll-over bar which can be produced cost effectively, it is proposed that the necessary drive and locking mechanism be actuated by means of a common electric motor (16). In order to lock the roll-over bar (1) using a threaded spindle (15), a threaded crossmember (17) is driven and is provided with running rollers (27, 28) which each run in a curved slot (29, 30) in a detent pawl (31, 32) and in so doing cause the detent pawls (31, 32) to execute a pivot movement. The extension movement of the roll-over bar (1) is carried out by means of a drive-type fastening between the threaded crossmember (17) and a transverse strut (14) which is fixedly connected to the roll-over bar (1). The working and idle strokes of the individual operating elements are such that the detent pawls (31, 32) only engage when the roll-over bar (1) has reached its extended position. Correspondingly, the roll-over bar (1) also only moves from its extended position towards its retracted position when the detent pawls (31, 32) are unlocked.

A rectilinearly extensible roll bar (1) for motor vehicles, having a driving and locking
mechanism equipped with a threaded drive which is driven by a electric motor (16) and the

shaft of which moves a threaded cross-bar (17) in the direction of the extension movement of
the roll bar (1), characterised in that, by means of a driving connection having an idle travel,

the threaded cross-bar (17) moves a crosspiece (14), which is rigidly coupled to the bar
pipe (2) of the roll bar (1), up and down parallel to the threaded spindle (15) of the threaded

drive and, at the same time, locks the locking mechanism in the extended end position of the
bar pip (2) of the roll bar (1) and unlocks the locking mechanism when the bar pipe (2) is

retracted.
A rectilinearly extensible roll bar according to claim 1, characterised in that the locking
device is formed by at least one pivoted pawl (31, 32) having a guide rail (29, 30) that is

curved for a portion of its length and along which a respective extension (27, 28) of the
threaded cross-bar (17) runs, so that, as the threaded cross-bar (17) moves linearly, the pawl

(31, 32) executes a pivoting movement as the curve of the guide rail (29, 30) is travelled.
A rectilinearly extensible roll bar according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that at
least one pressure spring (24, 25) produces zero axial backlash between threaded

cross-bar (17) and crosspiece (14).
A rectilinearly extensible roll bar according to claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that
each guide rail is a slot (29, 30) and each extension is a roller (27, 28).
A rectilinearly extensible roll bar according to claim 3 or claim 4, characterised in that
the extended position of the roll bar i
s defined by a stop (26, 3) that limits the extension
movement of the crosspiece (14), after reaching which stop the crosspiece (14) remains

stationary and the threaded cross-bar (17) carries out the idle travel while compressing the
pressure spring(s) (25, 26) and runs by its extension(s) (27, 28) along the curve of the

associated guide rail (29, 30), so that the respective pawl (31, 32) pivots under the bar ends of 
the roll bar (1) with a radial locking edge (41, 42) and prevents the roll bar (1) from being

pushed into the retracted position.
