<CLAIMS>
Semiconductor laser array with vertical cavities and surface 
emission comprising a conductor substrate (1) and, on 

said substrate, in succession a lower mirror (2), an optically 
active layer (4) and an upper mirror (6,7,12,14), 

characterized in that the upper mirror comprises a plurality 
of high reflectivity areas (14) surrounded by lower reflectivity 

areas (12) and also comprises metallized areas (8) 
serving as current leads, said metallized areas (8) being 

positioned above the lower reflectivity areas (12). 
Laser array according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the upper mirror (6, 7) comprises a stack of alternately high 

and low index layers with a smaller number of layers in the 
lower reflectivity areas (12) than in the high reflectivity 

areas (14). 
Laser array according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the upper mirror comprises a stack of alternately strong and 

weak index layers (6) and, in the high reflectivity areas (14), 
a supplementary reflecting means (7) for increasing said 

reflectivity. 
Laser array according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the upper mirror comprises a stack of alternately high and 

low index layers (6, 7), said stack having etched areas (8) 
defining the lower reflectivity areas. 
Laser array according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the active layer (4) is surrounded by two confinement layers 

(3,5).  
 
Laser array according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the active layer (4) is of the multiple quantum well type. 
Laser array according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the substrate (1) is transparent.
