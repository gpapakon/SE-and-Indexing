Multiple glazing pane, incorporating a transparent substrate 
(1), notably of glass, having thin multiple films on which are 

deposited, in succession: 

a first coating of dielectric material (2), 
a first film (3) having reflective properties in the 
infrared, notably based upon metal, 
a second coating of dielectric material (5), 
a second film (6) having reflective properties in the 
infrared, notably based upon metal, 
a third coating of dielectric material (8), characterized in 
that the thickness of the first film having reflective 

properties in the infrared (3), that is to say that which is 
nearest the supporting substrate, corresponds to from 50 to 70%, 

and notably 65%, of that of the second film having reflective 
properties in the infrared (6), in such a way that the visual 

appearance of said glazing pane in external reflection remains 
identical, whatever the angle of incidence, the values of a* and 

b* in the colorimetric system (L, a*, b*, c*) remaining 
unchanged, less than 3 and of negative sign. 
Glazing pane according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
optical thickness of the second coating of dielectric material 

(5) is greater than or equal to 110% of the sum of the optical 
thicknesses of the other two coatings (2, 8) of dielectric 

material, and preferably corresponds to 110-120% of said sum. 
Glazing pane according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
optical thicknesses of the first coating of dielectric material 

(2) and of the third coating of dielectric material (8) are 
equal. 
Glazing pane according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
optical thickness of the first coating of dielectric material  

 
(2) is greater than the optical thickness of the third coating 

of dielectric material (8), the optical thickness of the first 
coating (2) corresponding, notably, to at least 110%, notably at 

least 110 to 140% and preferably to 125%, of the optical 
thickness of the third coating (8). 
Glazing pane according to claim 4, characterized in that the 
optical thickness of the second coating of dielectric material 

(5) is equal to the sum of the optical thicknesses of the first 
and third dielectric coatings (2, 8). 
Glazing pane according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that each of the films having reflective 

properties in the infrared (3, 6) is overlain by a partly 
oxidized "barrier" fine metallic film (4, 7), notably based upon 

a nickel-chrome alloy or titanium, and preferably having a 
thickness of 1 to 3 nanometres.

characterized in that the films (3, 6) having reflective 

properties in the infrared are based upon silver. 
Glazing pane according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that at least one of the three coatings of 

dielectric material (2, 5, 8) is based upon tantalum oxide, tin 
oxide, zinc oxide, niobium oxide, titanium oxide or a mixture of 

said oxides, or again is constituted of a first film of tin 
oxide overlain by a second film of tantalum oxide, niobium oxide 

or titanium oxide. 
Glazing pane according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the thickness of the first film having 

reflective properties in the infrared (3) lies between 7 and 9
