<ABSTRACT>
A fixture for welding a grounding connector (22) to a 
structural steel member (32) is disclosed. Such fixture is 

formed of a magnetic material so that the fixture is 
attracted to, and retained upon, the steel member (32). A 

chamber (14) is defined within the rectangular body (10) of 
the fixture, and an inlet passage (20) in the front of the 

fixture receives one end of the grounding connector (22). 
Thermit powder is introduced into the chamber (14), and an 

igniter cap (28) delivers a spark to the powder, which 
produces a molten mass of metal. The metal flows downwardly 

through the fixture and bonds the grounding connector and the 
fixture to the structural steel member. The method of 

utilizing such single-use fixture is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a fixture for welding a grounding 
connector to a steel member, and the method of using such fixture 
to perform such welding operation. Relatively expensive molds have previously been used to weld 
grounding cables to structural steel elements. Such molds have 
employed complex mechanical clamping mechanisms to engage the 
structural steel member, and to position the mold thereon. The 
molds are used several times, in order to reduce the cost per 
molding operation. Difficulty may be encountered in positioning, 
and then clamping the mold in position. Similarly, after the 
welding operation has been completed, difficulty is encountered in 
removing the mold from the area of the welding joint formed between 
the grounding cables and the flat steel surface to which it is 
bonded. Such molds are available from Erico Products, Inc., 
Cleveland (Solon), Ohio 44139.  The present invention provides an inexpensive, single 
use, fixture that welds a grounding connector to a structural 
steel member. The fixture is formed of a magnetic material that 
is attracted to, and retained upon, the structural steel member, 
thus obviating the need for mechanical clamping systems used with 
conventional molds used for similar purposes. The present invention includes a fixture including a 
body with an interior chamber adapted to receive thermit powder, 
and an igniter cap positioned above the chamber. An inlet 
passage extends angularly upwardly from the front face of the 
fixture, and one end of a grounding connector is inserted, and 
retained, therein. A rectangular outlet is defined in the rear 
face of the fixture. When the igniter cap is actuated to produce 
a spark, the thermit burns very rapidly and produces a molten 
metal mass that bonds the connector to the structural steel 
member. The fixture is also bonded in fixed position on the 
structural steel member. A grounding cable, or conductor, is 
secured to the connector to complete the connection. The present invention contemplates a simple method of 
using the fixture to produce a connection that is reliable and 
long-lived. The resultant connection is equal, if not superior, 
to connections formed by known, multiple use molds with complex 
mechanical clamping systems.  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment 
of a fixture constructed in accordance with the principles of the 
present invention, such fixture being used to weld a grounding 
stud to a structural steel member; FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the

<CLAIMS>
A fixture (10); 50) for forming connection between a 
connector and a structural steel member (32); 66), said 

fixture comprising: 

a) a body (12); 52) having a front wall, or rear wall, a pair 
of spaced side walls, a top wall, and a bottom wall, 
b) said body having a chamber (14); 54) formed therein, 
c) said chamber (14); 54) opening upwardly through said top 
wall, 
d) said chamber terminating in a channel (16); 56) at its 
lower end, 
e) an inlet passage (20); 58) extending inwardly, and 
upwardly, from the front wall of said body (12); 52), 
f) an outlet (18); 62) defined through said rear wall of said 
body, 
g) a connector retained within said inlet passage in 
communication with said channel (16); 56) and said outlet 

(18); 62), 
h) magnetic means for securing said fixture to said 
structural steel member (32); 66), 
i) an ignitable substance introduced into said chamber (14), 
and 
j) an igniter cap positioned over the open upper end of said 
chamber (14); 54) for providing a spark to said ignitable 

substance which produces a molten metal mass that flows 
through said channel (16); 56) and said outlet (18); 62) 

to bond said connector (22); 60) top said structural steel 
member (32); 66). 
A fixture as defined in claim 1 wherein said body (12) is 
rectangular in shape and is formed of a magnetic material 

that is attracted to said structural steel member (32). 
A fixture as defined in claim 1 wherein said ignitable 
substance is thermit powder. 
A method of using a fixture to form a connection between a 
connector (22) and a structural steel member (32) defined 

therein, said fixture comprising a rectangular body (10) with 
a member, said method comprising the steps of 


a) adhering said fixture to said structural steel member (32) 
by magnetic attract
ion, 
b) inserting a connector (22) into said fixture until said 
connector (22) establishes communication with said chamber 

(14), 
c) establishing communication between said fixture and said 
structural steel member (32), 
d) introducing thermit powder into said chamber (14), 
e) igniting said thermit powder to initiate an exothermic 
reaction that produces a molten metal mass, 
f) permitting said mass to flow downwardly through said 
fixture to bond said connector (22) and said fixture to 

said structural steel member (32). 
The method of claim 5 further including the steps of 
positioning an actuator cap (28) over said chamber (14), and 

then actuating said cap (28) to produce a spark.
