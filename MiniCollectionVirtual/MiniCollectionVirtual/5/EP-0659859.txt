<ABSTRACT>
A two-part, mixable, structural acrylic adhesive characterized by long open 
time, relatively quick cure, good strength properties and ability to fill large 

gaps comprising a polymerizable acrylic monomer and peroxy polymerization 
initiator in one part and a mixture of a transition metal compound and o-benzosulfimide 

in acrylic monomer in the second part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a two-part, mixable, structural
adhesive system, applied as a single part and characterized long open time,
good strength properties and relatively quick cure, both anaerobic and aerobic,
as well as being gap-filling. More particularly, this invention involves a two-part
acrylic adhesive comprising in one-part a polymerizable acrylic monomer and
a peroxy polymerization initiator and in the second part a mixture of a
transition metal compound and saccharin (o-benzosulfimide) as well as acrylic
monomer.Many acrylic adhesive systems having various characteristics and properties
are known in the art as disclosed in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science &
Technology, Vol. 1, pp. 571-572, 1985. The early acrylic engineering adhesives
include well known DuPont technology directed to two-part adhesives involving
methyl methacrylate as the principal monomer, chlorosulfonated polyethylene as
the elastomer and cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) as the initiator US-A-3,890,407.
These adhesives are
characterized by rapid cure and have two other distinguishing properties, first,
the cured polymer contains elastomeric domains, derived from grafting to the
dispersed rubber and second, the monomers are capable of dissolving the oil often
found on metal surfaces. Such adhesives are, therefore, much tougher and impact
resistant than ordinary acrylic adhesives and additionally can be used on
unprepared metal surfaces.US-A-3,591,438
discloses increasing the curing speed of peroxy initiated acrylate adhesives by
treating one or more of the surfaces to be bonded with a bonding accelerator
containing an aldehyde-amine condensation product and as a reducing activator 
either a sulfur-containing free radical accelerator or a compound containing an
oxidizable transition metal.US-A-4,223,115
discloses structural adhesive systems for metal-bonding comprising a solution of
polymerizable material having incorporated therein certain phosphorous-containing
compounds and characterized by an ability of providing strong adhesion to
untreated metal surfaces.US-A-4,348,503 and 4,432,829
disclose adhesive compositions
capable of functioning either aerobically or anaerobically and which include an
acrylate monomer, a suitable elastomeric filler, an aromatic perester catalyst
and a dibasic acid capable of cyclic tautomerism and optionally a small amount
of a transition metal cure accelerator.US-A-3,046,262 discloses
accelerated anaerobic curing compositions wherein a peroxy catalyst and a
sulfimide accelerator are

<CLAIMS>
A curable two-part, mixable adhesive composition having long open time,
short handling time and provides both anaerobic and aerobic cure comprising a polymerizable acrylic

an organic hydroperoxide having the formula R-OOH, an organic peroxide having the

formula ROOR' or a perester of the formula


where R and R' in each of the above formulas represents a hydrocarbon group of
1 to 18 carbon atoms.

of the composition contain a rubbery polymer or elastomer.

acrylic monomer and from 5 to 80% by weight by the rubbery polymer or

elastomer, based on the total weight of the composition are used.

peroxy initiator is used, based on the weight of the part in which it is contained. 
The composition of Claim 8 wherein the transition metal compound is copper

mixable ratio by volume of the two part is used.
