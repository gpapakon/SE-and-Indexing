<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to aqueous 
compositions containing aluminum nitride (AIN) powder and 
methods of processing AlN powder in water. More 
specifically, this invention relates to aqueous 
compositions containing AlN powder and combinations of 
buffering agents and methods of using such compositions. Ceramic materials are used today in many applications 
that call for durable, tough, and heat-resistant materials. 
In making ceramic articles, a ceramic composite powder is 
often made by first wet mixing ceramic powder, such as AlN 
powder, with ceramic composite components, such as binders, 
lubricants, sintering aids, and other processing aids in a 
liquid medium. Traditionally, when AlN powder is used as the ceramic 
powder, the wet mixing is performed using ethanol or some 
nonaqueous liquid as the liquid medium to aid in mixing. 
Water is generally not a suitable liquid medium for wet 
mixing with AlN powder because AlN is highly sensitive to 
hydrolysis. When AlN powder is hydrolyzed by water, 
undesirable aluminum hydroxides are formed on the powder, 
concomitant with an increased oxygen content. Due to environmental concerns, water would be an ideal 
liquid medium for wet mixing AlN powder with the other 
components. If water were used as the liquid medium, no 
precautions would need to be taken to avoid exposure to the 
liquid medium during wet mixing operations. Additionally, 
containment of the liquid medium and precautions to avoid 
the dangers of flammable liquids during and after mixing 
would be unnecessary. Water also has the advantage of 
being relatively inexpensive and readily available.  
 DE-A-3925338 discloses a process for the improvement 
of the water resistance of aluminium nitride powder by 
suspending this powder in a non-aqueous solution of a 
phosphoric acid compound. As phosphoric acid compound, an 
inorganic compound like orthophosphoric acid can be used 
(page 2, lines 63-65). According to a comparative example 
the aluminium nitride powder is treated with acetic acid 
(Table 1, last example). In this document the use of a 
weak acid in combination with its conjugated base is not 
described.  
 One embodiment of the invention is an aqueous 
composition containing AlN powder that exhibits a reduced 
tendency for hydrolysis of the AlN contained therein. The 
aqueous composition comprises (a) a liquid medium 
containing water, (b) AlN powder, and (c) a combination of 
buffering agents that includes a weak acid and a conjugate 
base of the weak acid and controls pH
