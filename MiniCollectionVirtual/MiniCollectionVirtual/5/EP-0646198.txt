<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to systems that are used by paper 
mills, and, more specifically, to a black liquor gasification system 
through the operation of which by using a fluidized bed reactor which 
makes a dry product chemicals from a Kraft process can be recovered 
without forming a smelt thereby removing the potential for 
smelt/water explosions. The type of systems to which reference is made herein 
historically have been comprised of what is commonly known in the 
industry as a Chemical Recovery Unit or CRU. Chemical Recovery Units 
are boilers that are used by paper mills for two reasons. The 
primary reason, as the name Chemical Recovery Unit suggests, is to 
recover the chemicals that are used in the process of breaking down 
the wood into the pulp which is then made into paper. The wood in 
the process of being broken down is treated in a vessel called a 
digester by heating with steam and mixing with chemicals. The used 
chemical residue which is produced as a result of processing the wood 
in the digester is commonly referred to as "Weak Black Liquor". This 
liquid is mainly water, i.e., approximately 84%, at this stage. 
Subsequent processing reduces the water content until the water 
content is approximately 32% of the volume. The liquid in this state 
is commonly referred to as "Strong Black Liquor". "Strong Black 
Liquor" constitutes the fuel which is burned in the Chemical Recovery 
Unit, i.e., boiler, to make steam. As the "Strong Black Liquor" is 
burned in the Chemical Recovery Unit the chemicals which do not burn 
form a molten pool in the bottom of the Chemical Recovery Unit and  
 
this pool, referred to in the industry as the "smelt", is 
continuously drawn off and processed to return the chemicals to the 
digester whereupon the cycle is once again repeated. Chemical Recovery Units insofar as they are boilers 
operate in essentially the same manner as any other boiler. As do 
all other boilers, Chemical Recovery Units burn a fuel to create 
heat. This heat in turn is used to convert water into steam which is 
used either as steam or converted via the use of a turbine into 
electricity. The one main difference between a Chemical Recovery 
Unit and all other types of boilers is that the Chemical Recovery 
Unit unlike all other types of boilers has at all times in the bottom 
thereof a smelt bed. The potential result of a waterwall leak in any other 
type of boiler other than a Chemical Recovery Unit is the loss of 
pressure and the destruction of a few of the surrounding tubes. On
