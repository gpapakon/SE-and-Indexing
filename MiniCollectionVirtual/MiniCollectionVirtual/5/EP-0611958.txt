<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a wheel-acting force measuring 
device free from the influences of cross talk due to brake 

torque (torsional torque). 
A hole (2) is formed in or adjacent an axle (1) of a vehicle at 
a brake caliper angle or an angle (14) close thereto, and a 

stress detecting sensor (3) is embedded at a position in the 
hole (2) which coincides with the stress center axis (5) of or 

adjacent the axle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel-acting force
measuring device for detecting a road surface friction
force, a normal counterforce and a road surface friction
coefficient, which can be used as a component of either an
antilock brake system (ABS) for preventing the locking of
wheels on application of the hard brake to a vehicle or a
traction control system for preventing excessive slippage
of wheels during acceleration.As for such wheel-acting force measuring device for
detecting a load surface friction force, a normal
counterforce and a road surface friction coefficient, which
can be used as a component of either an antilock brake
system for vehicles or a traction control system, various
types have heretofore been developed and proposed.
However, such known devices require a relative-to-ground
velocity sensor or a vehicle deceleration sensor to
accurately find the vehicle velocity, making the device
complicated and presenting a problem of accuracy. Thus,
there has been a need for a device for directly measuring
dynamic quantities concerning actions between the road
surface and the wheels. To meet this need, the present applicant proposed in EP-A-504
731 a wheel-acting force measuring device comprising a
hole formed in or adjacent an axle, a stress sensor having a
strain gauge attached thereto, said stress sensor being fixedly
embedded in said hole with its strain gauge oriented in
a suitable direction according to an intended stress or load,
so that it is capable of directly measuring an optional
stress or load occurring in or adjacent the axle.However, there is a problem that detection signals delivered
from the stress detecting sensor are influenced by
cross talk according to the selected position of the hole
since there are produced in or adjacent the axle a complicated
shearing strain accompanying a bending deformation
caused by a road surface friction force, a vertical stress
and a side force acting on the wheel and a shearing strain
accompanying a torsional deformation caused by the brake
torque during application of the brake.It is the object of the present invention to solve the
problem and to provide a wheel-acting force measuring device
which is not influenced by cross talk.This object is met by a device according to claim 1.
Preferred embodiments are disclosed in the dependent claims.When a stress
detecting sensor is fixedly embedded in a spindle of an axle
at a position between the brake disk attaching position of
a vehicle and the road-contacting surface of a wheel, there
occurs less
