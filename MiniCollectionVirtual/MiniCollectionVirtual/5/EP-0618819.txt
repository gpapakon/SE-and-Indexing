<ABSTRACT>
The catheter (1) with atraumatic drug delivery tip (9) can be used to access remote tortuous blood vessel and to deliver defined doses of medication over a desired length of the accessed vessel. The guide wire (3) of the catheter (1) helps guiding the catheter (1) to a desired location and can be used to control release of medication in axial as well as in radial direction inside the vessel (2). The catheter (1) is designed with sections (92, 93 and 94) of different flexibility.

<DESCRIPTION>
The catheter of the present invention is a new
type of catheter for controlled dispensing of fluids in
remote areas of a body.Catheters for dispensing fluids in remote areas
of a body are used in a variety of different clinical
procedures. Some of these procedures require delivery of
contrasting fluids for x-ray procedures, other procedures
require delivery of medication at remote locations
accessible through blood vessels.Catheters are inserted either directly or with
the help of guidewires. In either case the distal end
section has to include means for guiding the device
through blood vessels to the destination location without
causing damage. Many different implementations for the
distal end sections of guidewires and catheters are
available. There are catheters available with sideholes
for providing a temporary flow channel through a closed
vessel. In such an application the sideholes upstream to
the closure provide entrance of blood, the sideholes
downstream of the closure provide for the exit of blood.
In such an application the sideholes and the catheter
have to be of a size to allow sufficient flow-through for
the closed vessel.Another type of catheter with a plurality of
sideholes has each of the sideholes connected to a
separate lumen. Such a catheter allows to administer
different medications at remote locations and at 
independent rates. Such catheters have a large outside
diameter and are relatively stiff.Large diameter catheters and catheters with
large sideholes or with sideholes connected to separate
lumens are too stiff and large for use in cerebral
vessels or to remain overnight in a coronary artery of a
beating heart artery. They do not include the multipurpose
applicability as needed for treatment of heart
ailments including penetration of blood clots,
dissolution of blood clots and dispensation of medication
at desired rates over a desired length of a blood vessel. EP-A-0 476 796 discloses a pressure responsive valve
catheter in which a plurality of pressure responsive exits are
formed in the side wall of the distal portion of the catheter
body. These exits all have the same geometry so that the load
at which they will open is the same.US-A-4 808 158 discloses a vascular catheter comprising a
flexible tube having blood passage orifices at its anterior
and insertion end. A piston-like closure member is moveable
too and fro in the tube in a lengthwise direction. In this
way, the closure member can cover and thereby close at least
some of the orifices in one position and clear these

<CLAIMS>
A catheter device for dispensing medication
comprising:


an elongated tubular body having a proximal end section, a
main section and a distal end section (8, 51 80); and a port

(5) in the proximal end section for supplying medication into
said catheter;
said distal end section (8, 51, 80) having a plurality of
radial holes (7, 50, 84) for radially

ejecting said medication, and a tip (9, 53) located distally in
said distal end section and including an axial hole (22, 72)

for axially ejecting medication, characterised in that said radial
holes (7, 50, 84) are of different diameters and are spirally

arranged in order of their diameter, with the
larger diameter holes being located towards said tip (9, 53) of

said distal end section.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said
tip (9, 53) is chamfered at an angle suitable for penetrating

soft blood clots.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 2, wherein said
tip (9, 53) is chamfered at an angle b
etween 15° and 45°.
A catheter device as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, further comprising:


a guidewire (3, 73, 83) having a first end section
extending beyond said proximal end of said tubular body, a

center section extending along the length and inside of said
tubular body, and a second end section extending through said

axial hole and beyond said tip of said distal end section.
A catheter device as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said tip includes a valve seat (20,

71) having said axial hole for axially ejecting said
medication.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 5, wherein said
valve seat is exchangeably mounted inside said distal end

section and in close proximity to said tip.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 5 or claim 6,
wherein said valve seat is exchangeable with a valve seat of a

different axial hole size.
A catheter device as claimed in any one of claims 5
to 7 when dependent on claim 4, wherein said second end section

of said guidewire (73) includes an enlarged diameter section
(75) having a diameter larger than said axial hole (72), said

enlarged diameter section and said valve seat (71) having
complementary interfacing surfaces whereby to constitute a

valve for controlling axial dispensation of said medication.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 4, wherein said
second end of said guidewire (3) has a diameter only slightly

smaller than said axial hole (22), whereby said guidewire (3),
when extending through said axial hole, substantially reduces

fluid flow through said axial hole.
A catheter device as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, further including a first radiopaque marker

(23) for marking the interface of said main section and said
distal end section (8) of said tubular body; and a second

radiopaque marker (21, 77) in close proximity to said tip (9)
for marking the location of the medication dispensing distal 

end section.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 4, wherein said
guidewire (83) includes an enlarged diameter body (85) for

controlling dispensation of medication through said radial
holes (84), said enlarged diameter body (85) having a diameter

slightly smaller than the inner diameter of said distal end
section (80) of said tubular body, said enlarged diameter body

(85) being adapted to move inside said distal end section of
said tubular body from said tip towards said main section upon

advancement or retraction at said first end of said guidewire,
thereby reducing or increasing the number of radial holes (84)

for dispensation of medication.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 11, further
including a first radiopaque marker for marking the interface

of said main section and said distal end section of said
tubular body.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 12, further
including a second radiopaque marker included in said enlarged

diameter body for marking the distance over which medication is
to be dispensed.
A catheter device as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said tubular body further comprises

of a plurality of intermediate sections, each one of said
plurality of intermediate sections having a different

characteristic flexibility.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 14, wherein
each of said sections has an inner tubular segment of a

specific flexibility and wherein all of said sections have an 
outer tube (91) in common.
A catheter device as claimed in claim 14, wherein at
least one of said intermediate sections has an inner tubular

section with linearly changing flexibility along the length of
said at least one intermediate section.
A catheter device as claimed in any one of claims 14
to 16, wherein said tubular body is constructed to be

relatively axially rigid in said main section, and
progressively more axially flexible along said intermediate

sections so as to be most axially flexible in the intermediate
section nearest the tip of the distal end section.
