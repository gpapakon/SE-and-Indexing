<ABSTRACT>
A self-adhesive lid film for the packaging of electronic components (belts) whose adhesive layer is covered so as to be non-adhesive in the centre, characterised in that the adhesive layer comprises a mixture of two acrylate adhesive compositions of different polarity, where one, highly polar component contains from 1% to 20%, in particular from 6% to 10%, especially about 8%, of acrylic acid in the monomer composition, and the other, rather non-polar component contains from 5% to 50%, in particular from 10% to 30%, especially about 20%, of stearyl acrylate in the monomer composition, and where an adhesion promoter (primer) is present between the adhesive layer and the film support (carrier, substrate, base) of the lid film.

Self-adhesive lidding film having a film support 
and an adhesive layer covered in a non-adhesive manner in 

the centre, for packaging electronic components in 
thermoformed caverns of film sheeting, characterized in 

that the adhesive layer comprises a mixture of two 
acrylate adhesive composition components of different 

polarity, the first, highly polar component containing 
from 1% to 20% of acrylic acid in the monomer composition, 

and the other, rather nonpolar component containing 
from 5% to 50% of stearyl acrylate in the monomer composition, 

and where an adhesion promoter is present between 
the adhesive layer and the film support of the lidding 

film. 
Lidding film according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the polar component contains 6-10% of acrylic 

acid. 
Lidding film according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the polar component contains 8% of acrylic acid. 
Lidding film according to Claim [lacuna] , 

characterized in that the nonpolar component contains 
10-30% of stearyl acrylate. 
Lidding film according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the nonpolar component contains 20% of stearyl 

acrylate. 
Lidding film according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the adhesive layer is covered in the centre by an 

optionally conductive plastic film. 
Lidding film according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the film support of the lidding film comprises 

polyester. 
Lidding film according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the adhesion promoter comprises a reactive 

acrylic copolymer with an epoxy curing agent, in particular 
based on bisphenol A. 
Lidding film according to Claim 8, characterized 
in that the weight ratio between the reactive acrylic 

copolymer and the epoxy curing agent in the adhesion  
 

promoter is from 95 : 5 to 80 : 20, in particular 
88.5 : 11.5. 
Lidding film according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the adhesive layer has been exposed to electron 

irradiation. 
Use of a self-adhesive lidding film according to 
one of Claims 1 - 10 for sealing packaging for electronic 

components which are intended for use in high-speed 
automatic machines.
