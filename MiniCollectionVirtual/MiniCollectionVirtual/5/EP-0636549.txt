<ABSTRACT>
Assembly for dispensing product of pasty fluid consistency, which includes a container (2) made of flexible material containing the product and a dispensing head which includes a dome (3) and is equipped with at least one dispensing orifice (4) capable of being closed by a movable stud (7) carried by an elastically deformable membrane (6), the container (2) and the dome (3) constituting a single piece obtained by moulding, a rigid insert (5) being put into position at the base of the dome (3) and delimiting a space (25) between the insert and the dome (3), the said insert (5) including channels (23), which brings the said space (25) into communication with the container (2), and carrying, opposite the orifice (4), the deformable membrane (6), the insert (5) consisting of a disc (14) through which are provided the channels (23) and of a support element (15) carrying the membrane (6), solidly attached to the said disc (14), and arranged in the central region of the disc (14) which includes a circular plate (16), the central region of which is solid and which is moulded as a single piece with an annular element (17) which forms, together with the plate (16), a cylindrical blind housing (14a) inside which the support element (15) is fixed, the annular element (17) carrying, at its upper part, a flange (19) coming to bear against a step (3a) provided inside the dome (3) at the junction between the skirt (11) and the cupola (13).

Assembly for dispensing a product of pasty-to-fluid 
consistency, which includes a container (2) made of 

flexible material containing the fluid product to be 
dispensed and a dispensing head which includes a dome (3) 

consisting of a skirt (11) and of a cupola (13) equipped 
with at least one dispensing orifice (4) capable of being 

closed by a movable stud (7) carried by an elastically 
deformable membrane (6), the orifice (4) being closed off 

by the stud (7) in the absence of any overpressure on the 
said membrane on the side where the said stud is located 

and being freed when an over-pressure is applied to the 
said membrane on the side where the said stud is located, 

the container (2) and the dome (3) constituting a single 
piece obtained by moulding, a rigid insert (5) being put 

into position at the base of the dome (3) and delimiting 
a space (25) between the insert and the dome (3), the 

said insert (5) including at least one channel (23), 
which brings the said space (25) into communication with 

the container (2), and carrying, opposite the orifice 
(4), the deformable membrane (6), the latter imparting to 

the stud (7) a bearing force against the edges of the 
opening (4), the said bearing force and the area of 

contact between the stud (7) and the edges of the opening 
(4) being, in the closure position, sufficient for the 

said closure to prevent any air uptake after dispensing, 
the insert (5) consisting of a disc (14) through which is 

(are) provided the channel (channels) (23) and of a 
support element (15) which carries the membrane (6) and 

is solidly attached to the said disc (14), the support 
element (15) being arranged in the central region of the 

disc (14), characterized in that the disc (14) includes, 
in its part facing the tube (2), a circular plate (16), 

the central region of which is solid and which is moulded 
as a single piece with an annular element (17) which 

forms, together with the plate (16), a cylindrical blind 
housing (14a) inside which the support element (15) i
s 
fixed, the annular element (17) carrying, at its upper 

part, a flange (19) coming to bear against a step (3a)  
 

provided inside the dome (3) at the junction between the 
skirt (11) and the cupola (13). 
Assembly according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the support element (15) comprises a cylindrical 

skirt (20) which fits into the blind housing (14a) with 
a slight interference, and a base constituting the 

membrane (6). 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the support element (15) is surrounded 

by a plurality of channels (23) organized in a 
ring around it. 
Assembly according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the circular plate (16) is equipped with four 

openings forming the entrance of the channels (23) which 
are uniformly arranged at the periphery of the annular 

element (17) and which run out in the flange (19). 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the dispensing orifice (4) 

includes, opposite the membrane (6), a frustoconical 
bearing surface (4
a
), the stud (7) being shaped at its 
free end with a frustoconical bearing surface (7
a
) 
substantially of the same vertex angle. 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it includes a cap (8) capable of 

covering the dome (3), being fixed to its base. 
Assembly according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the cap (8) includes, on the inside, a nipple (24) 

arranged in line with the dispensing orifice (4) when the 
cap is fixed to the dome (3). 
Assembly according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the dispensing orifice (4) is terminated, towards 

the outside of the dome (3), by a frustoconical bearing 
surface (4
b
), and in that the nipple (24) is shaped at 
its free end with a frustoconical bearing surface (24
a
) 
of substantially the same vertex angle. 
Assembly according to Claims 5 and 8 taken 
together, characterized in that the two frustoconical 

bearing surfaces (4
a
, 4
b
) of the dispensing orifice (4) 
are separated from each other by a cylindrical region.  

 
Assembly according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the container (2) and the dome (3) 

are produced from a heat-sealable multilayer plastic 
whereas the disc (14) and the support element (15) are 

produced from a moulded thermoplastic.
