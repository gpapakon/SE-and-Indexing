<ABSTRACT>
A protector (1) for remote controls comprises four L-shaped corner parts (4) having 
an elliptic cross section and which are coupled with two other pairs of longitudinal parts 

(2, 3) of corresponding cross section, and wherein they may slide in order to open and close 
the protector. The corner parts (4) are encompassed by an elastic part (5) passing through a 

space defined between the corner parts (4) and the longitudinal parts (2, 3) of the invention. 
The protector of the invention is a rigid and resistant device which is easy to use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a protection device for
hand-held remote controls, mainly control units for
electronic equipment such as television receivers, video
recorders, HI-FI, according to the preamble of claim 1 (WO-A-92/22918).Protection devices are known within this technical field of
hand-held remote control which comprise a single body, such
as the described in EP-527712 (09.08.91). This is a rubber
body, and features an internal housing space, into which
different controls of varying sizes can be inserted thanks
to the flexibility of the protector sleeve body where it
adapts to the shape of the remote control casing. The
protecting function of this device is achieved solely
through the flexibility of the material from which it is
made, but this brings problems that arise from ageing and
consequent perishing and cracking. Moreover, when the
material is stretched to envelop larger sized remote
controls, the cross section of the body become thinner, and
so its effectiveness as a bumper is jeopardized.Another kind of protector described in WO 92/22918 combines
the flexibility of the material with the possibility of its
accommodating differing sizes of remote control, inasmuch
that the protector frame is expandable in all three axes.
Such extension is achieved by means of some special parts
which are placed between the four half-shells that comprise
the protection case. All the components in this protector 
are of a highly complicated configuration, and this
jeopardizes the strength of the protector as a whole.
Furthermore, the material here lacks toughness.Is the object of the invention a shock-proof protector for
hand-held remote controls. It is made in the form of a frame
which surround the remote control, and includes an elastic
part which allows it to expand and thus accommodate various
sizes of remote control, plus an inside flexible part to
enable varying thicknesses of hand-held remote controls to
be accommodated, through its surface clinging to the edge
thereof. Stiff parts comprising the outside layer spread the
impact force, while the flexible inside layer in contact
with the remote control absorb it.The protector is extremely tough and life-long because its
flexible members are guarded against outside impacts and
rubbing through their location.To achieve these objectives, the protector provided by the
invention is generally prismatic is its general shape, and
comprises:
four identical "L" shaped stiff corner gussets, which make
up the protector surrounding frame,four straight span
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A protector (1) for hand-held remote controls formed as
an oblong frame surrounding the control unit edge perimeter

to protect it against impact damage, incorporating different
sections of hard and flexible materials, which comprise four

identical corner gussets (4) in the shape of a "L" of uneven
sides, each covering one of the cont
rol unit corners forming
a hollow space in both uppermost and lowermost flat faces

of the protector (1) for inserting the control unit inside,
guide means (2,3) for interconnecting said corner gussets

(4) and elastic means (5) that allow the protector (1) to
expand and to contract lengthwise and widthwise in order to

get adapted to different sizes ot control units, and one of
the shorter sides of the protector (1) is provided with an

opening to facilitate the passage of the signals it
transmits, 
characterised in that
said guide means (2,3) comprise two pairs of straight span
members different in length, whose section is in the shape

of an "U" with the ends turned inwards, being one of said
pairs two identical length span members (2) located in the

longer sides of the protector and the other pair being two
identical width span members (3) located in the shorter

sides, and the arms of the corner gussets (4) being received
inside the span members (2,3) telescopically guided;
said corner gussets (4) have a cross section matched to said
"U" shaped cross section of the span members (2,3), the

longer gussets (4) arms being housed into the length span
members (2) and the shorter into the width span members (3);
said elastic means (5) comprise an elastic strip in the form
of a closed rim which is fitted into a lengthwise groove (9)

provided in the exterior contour of the four corner gussets
(4) to hug them, and being positioned between the gussets

(4) and the span members (2,3);
the four straight span members (2,3) are provided with a
centre through hole (7,8) in which is engaged a pin (23)

protruding on the elastic strip (5) external face; 
each of the four corner gusset (4) interior hollow is
occupied by a flexible member (6) which likewise is in the

shape of a "L" which arms are the same length as those arms
of the corner gusset (4).
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claim 1, characterized in that the cross section of the

straight span members (2,3), and of the corner gussets (4)
arms, being "U" shaped are contoured by a theoretical

ellipse which make the outside shape of the gussets (4) fit
with the inside shape of the span members (2, 3).
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claim 1, characterized in that the two straight portions

on the corner gusset (4) arms have along the outside surface
of their edges a recess (13) which provide a sliding surface

within the guide-slots (16) upon the inside of span member
(2,3), being these guide-slots (16) abut in a stop (14) at

a certain distance from the ends of the span members (2, 3).
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claims 1 and 3, characterized in that said guide-slots

(16) are equally separated at their ends (14) from the ends
of length span members (2), where such separation is greater

on length span members (2) than it is on width span members
(3).
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claim 1, characterized in that the cross section of

elastic strip (5) is rectangular, and its external face in
contact with the span members (2, 3) is convex.
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claim 1, characterized in that the flexible members (6)

have an "U" shaped cross section, and their outer flat
surface (22) is impregnated with adhesive for their

attachment to the inside of corner gussets (4), and having 
moreover outside chamfers (25) which mate with other inside

chamfers within said corner gussets (4).
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claim 1, characterized in that the shorter arms of both

the corner gusset (4) and the flexible member (6) are
provided with an open lengthwise window (20).
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claim 1, characterized in that the width span members

(3) are transparent, and the elastic strip (5) is
translucent.
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claim 1, characterized in that in a second preferred

embodiment, the width span members (30) have a centred
window (31) of a basically oblong shape lengthwise

positioned through which signals from the control can pass,
where in this case, said width span members (30) are made

indifferently either from opaque or translucent material.
A protector for hand held remote controls, according
to claims 1 and 9, characterised in that the elastic strip

(5) in the form of a closed rim which is placed between the
span members (2, 30) and upon the "L" shaped corner gussets

(4) is made of silicone and is transparent.
