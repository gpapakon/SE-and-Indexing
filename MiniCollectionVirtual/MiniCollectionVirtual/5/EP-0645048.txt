<ABSTRACT>
Inorganic oxides of substantially uniform particle size distribution are prepared by contacting aqueous solutions of an inorganic salt and an inorganic base across a porous membrane (14) wherein the membrane contains a plurality of pores which allows for precipitation of a substantially mono-dispersed size inorganic oxide particles on one side of the membrane and precipitation of a salt of the corresponding base on a second side of the membrane (Fig. 1). The particles so prepared can be coated with an organo-metallic polymer having attached thereto an organic functionality to which a variety of organic and/or biological molecules can be coupled. Particles so coupled may be used for in vitro or in vivo systems involving separations steps or the directed movement of coupled molecules to particular sites, including immunological assays, other biological assays, biochemical or enzymatic reactions, affinity chromatographic purification, cell sorting and diagnostic and therapeutic uses. In a further embodiment, described herein are liposome compositions which comprise the substantially uniform size inorganic core coated with an amphipathic organic compound and further coated with a second amphipathic vesicle forming lipid (Fig. 2). Also disclosed are novel phenyl lipid compounds which serve as the vesicle forming lipid (Fig. 3). When the magnetic particles are electromagnetic wave-absorbing surface modified particles (Fig. 4), such particles provide for the preparation of liposome compositions which offer a method for the treatment of cancer, as well as infectious diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PREPARATION OF CONTROLLED SIZE INORGANIC PARTICLES FOR USE IN SEPARATIONS, AS MAGNETIC MOLECULAR SWITCHES, AND AS INORGANIC LIPOSOMES FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONSField of the Invention This invention relates to a method for producing inorganic oxides of substantially uniform particle size distribution, coating said particles with various functional moieties, and clustering said moieties together via controllably degradable chemical, complex, or ionic bonds. More particularly, this invention relates to a method of producing magnetic inorganic oxide particles of substantially uniform size, or organic coated particle beads, linking the particle or particle bead together to form a large aggregate cluster with different chemical, physical, or magnetic properties than the unit particle or bead, and controllably and predictably revising the cluster back to unit bead or particle size and vice versa. The substantially uniform size inorganic oxides also allow for the preparation of novel inorganic core liposome compositions for in vivo and in vitro medical applications. Background of the Invention Separations of all types are routinely done by the exploitation of physical and chemical differences in the various species to be separated. Size exclusion, boiling point, and chemical affinity are techniques that have been used for separations of particles, chemical species, and biological moieties for hundreds of years. More recently, the use of magnetism has been used as a tool for separation of various species material from one another. By the early 1960's, the first stable magnetic fluid colloid had been described. Later research led to the development of a separations device based on magnetic density gradients in magnetic fluid columns. By 1979, magnetic particles coated with appropriate functional 

chemical groups for affinity chromatography separations were reported. The first commercial application of magnetic separations was described by Chagnon et al in U.S. Patent No. 4,628,037. The Chagnon patent describes the use of amine terminated silane coupled magnetic particles for immunodiagnostic applications. The materials described in the Chagnon et al patent are now used commercially in medical diagnostic kits. Magnetic separations have not been exclusively applied to in vitro applications. The use of magnetic separations for in vivo applications is becoming increasingly more accepted and important as a therapeutic and diagnostic tool. By the early 1980' s, published reports described the magnetic targeting and
