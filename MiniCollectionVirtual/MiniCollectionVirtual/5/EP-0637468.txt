<ABSTRACT>
The roller consists of a stirrup-shaped holder (4) for the roller, and a handle (1) which is made in two lengthwise sections (2,3) which can clip together when in use and be folded parallel to the lengthwise axis of the holder, e.g. for packaging. The handle and holder are moulded from plastics in one piece with hinges (42,43) for the two handle sections. A projection (44) on the holder engages with two cavities (11) in the handle sections when they are clipped together.

<CLAIMS>
Support device for the cylindrical sleeve of a paint 
roller, characterised in that said support produced by the 

moulding of a plastic material comprises a sleeve (1) divided 
lengthwise into two portions (2, 3; 2', 3') able to be 

rendered integral with each other by latching means joined to 
the clamp (4) intended to support the cylindrical sleeve and 

able to pivot by 90Â° from a position parallel to the clamp 
(4) to a position perpendicular to said clamp (4), the 

portions (2, 3; 2', 3') of the sleeve (1) being joined to the 

clamp (4) by means of moulded bridges (42, 43) on a block 
(41) projecting centrally from said clamp (4). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the sleeve (1) internally comprises at its base a cavity (11) 

in which a block (44) is narrowly inserted when said sleeve 
(1) is restored, said block having external dimensions equal 

to the internal dimensions of the cavity (11) and projecting 
centrally from the block (41). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the block (41) comprises at least one notch (46) made in a 

longitudinal direction perpendicular to the bridges (42, 43) 
in which at least one flat rib (22, 32) is engaged and fitted 

in each of said portions (2', 3') at their base, close to 
said bridges (42, 43) and perpendicular to the latter. 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that it comprises two parallel snugs (46, 

47) perpendicular to the clamp (4) and the sleeve (1).  
 
Device according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that one of the portions (2') constituting 

the sleeve (1) comprises at its free extremity a tubular 
potion (21) for the adaptation of an extension piece.
