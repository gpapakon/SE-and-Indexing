  in which formulae:     M is hydrogen or an alkali metal;   m is the number 1, 2 or 3; X is cyanoamino, alkoxy with 1 to 4 carbon atoms or alkoxy with 2 to 4 carbon atoms which is substituted by alkoxy with 1 to 4 carbon atoms; Y is vinyl or is ethyl which in the ss-position contains a substituent which can be eliminated by alkali to form the vinyl group;   R, R1 to R9 are hydrogen or substituents;   A is alkylene of 2 to 6 carbon atoms which may be substituted; V is a carbonyl group of the formula -CO-O- or an oxy group of the formula -O-; one group -SO3-M in formula (4) and in formula (7) is bonded in the meta- or para-position with respect to the amino group on the naphthalene ring system of the aminonaphthol residue.
