<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fit and support system for the 
foot and, more particularly to a fit and support system or footwear device 
suitable for sports footwear, such as ski boots, hockey skates, cycling shoes 
and the like. Thus, the invention relates in particular to applications 
where the footwear device serves as a connection means between the 
foot and sports equipment such as a ski, skate blade, roller skate wheels 
or a bicycle pedal. Alpine ski boots, ice skate footwear and cycling shoes are 
among the many types of sports footwear known. Existing footwear does 
not provide for the dynamic nature of the architecture of the foot by 
providing a fit system with dynamic and predictable qualities to 
substantially match those of the foot and lower leg. Although somewhat vaguely stated, a generally accepted 
theme has arisen over the years, one of indiscriminate envelopment and 
"overall restraint" applied to the foot and leg within the footwear. The 
stated position of various authorities skilled in the art of the design and 
fabrication of footwear for skiing is that the foot functions best when 
movement about its articulations are substantially prevented or 
restricted. Thus, the problem with existing footwear arises due to the 
dynamic nature of the architecture of the foot. When the wearer is 
standing with the weight equally distributed between left and right feet so 
that the centre of mass of the wearer is manifesting itself in the centre 
between the feet, the architecture of the wearer's foot assumes a specific 
configuration. As the wearer begins to shift his weight towards one foot 
so that the other foot bears proportionately less weight, the wearer's 
centre of mass moves over the medial aspect of the weighted foot so as to 
assume a position of balance. In order for this movement of the wearer's  
 
centre of mass to occur, the architecture of the weighted foot must 
undergo a progressive re-alignment. Existing footwear does not 
adequately anticipate this re-alignment of the architecture of the foot and 
thus such footwear inhibits the wearer's ability to assume a balanced 
position. A problem with existing footwear for skiing, in particular 
the rear entry type, relates to the obstruction of the leg in forward flexion. 
A relatively freely flexing gaiter or cuff is necessary in order to permit the 
posterior muscle groups of the lower leg to modulate external force 
exerted on the footwear. This requires that the axis of the footwear be 
allowed to rotate so that small degrees
