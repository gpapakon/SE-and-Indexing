<ABSTRACT>
A plane light source unit which may be advantageously used as a 
backlighting means for a liquid crystal display device, and which 

comprises a transparent light guide (1) having a side end surface (7) as 
a light incident surface, a surface (6) perpendicular to the light 

incident surface as a light emitting surface, and a light reflecting 
layer (2) provided on an opposite surface (9) to the light emitting 

surface (6); and a second element (3) having a large number of prism 
units formed on the light emitting surface (6) of the transparent light 

guide (1) which receives the light emitted from the transparent light 
guide (1) and emits the light in a predetermined direction; wherein at 

least one of the light emitting surface (6) and the opposite surface (9) 
of said transparent light guide (1) has a directional light emitting 

function which emits the incident light from the light incident surface 
(7) of the transparent light guide (1) in an oblique direction to the 

incident light and has a regulation function which makes the luminance 
of the light through the light emitting surface (6) uniform over the 

whole surface thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plane light 
source unit, and more particularly to a plane light source 
unit which may be advantageously used as a backlighting 
means for a liquid crystal display device or the like. Conventionally, a backlighting means for a 
liquid crystal display device or the like generally has 
such a construction that a linear lamp is located at a 
focus of a reflector having a parabolic section while 
a milk-white diffusing plate is located above the lamp. 
Various improvements were made to optimize the 
configuration of the reflector, to adjust the diffusion 
coefficient of the diffusing plate. Special constructions have also been provided 
which employ such a combination of a linear lamp and a 
light guide, one side end of which is adjacent to the 
lamp, and the configuration of the light guide is 
simulated by approximation to a point source and worked 
into a curved surface so as to emit the light in a 
particular direction, or the thickness of the light 
guide is varied along the direction of light, or else a 
lenticular is used wherein the prism angle is varied in 
accordance with the distance from the lamp, or otherwise 
such configurations as described above are combined 
suitably. Recently, plane light source units have been 
used as liquid crystal display units. However, the 
display device, which uses a conventional plane light 
source unit to obtain a high quality display, requires  
 
a thick plane light source unit. In particular, a plane 
light source unit for a large display with a size of 
10 to 12 inches requires the conventional unit having 
a thickness of 20 to 30 mm. Therefore, the conventional 
unit is impossible to be used as a thin plane light 
source unit. Various plane light source devices of edge-light 
types have been proposed. Each of these devices has 
a transparent light guide comprising a plate-shape 
transparent material such as an acrylic resin. Incident 
light from one end surface of the transparent light guide 
is then emitted from the upper or lower surface of the 
light guide. However, such a large liquid crystal 
display device with a size of 10 to 12 inches results in 
a display where luminance is decreased according to the 
distance from the light source or display with uneven 
luminance, so that a display of high quality cannot 
often be obtained. In order to solve this problem, a light guide 
having a thickness which varies according to the distance 
from a lamp, or a member which changes light path 
geometrically, is provided.
