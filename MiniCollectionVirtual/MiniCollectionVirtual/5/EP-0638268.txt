<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is an improvement to our invention 
described and claimed in United States Design Patent 
D.329,148, issued September 8, 1992, and United States Letters 
Patent 5,190,350, issued March 2, 1993, and the teaching and 
technology of each is incorporated herein by reference. The inventors of the present invention are Phillip 
Hwang and Lisa Hwang. Phillip Hwang and Lisa Hwang are 
citizens of the Republic of China with a residential address 
of Room 4-5 Buckingham Mansion, 6, Lane 269, Nanking East Rd., 
Sec. 3, Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China. The inventors 
mailing address is c/o Goodway Corporation, Post Office Box 
58994, Taipei, Taiwan Republic of China. This invention relates to the sleeping/seating art 
and, more particularly to an improved portable sleeping 
mat/seating arrangement particularly useful in various outdoor 
activities ranging from backpacking, camping, mountain 
climbing and the like, to comfortable seating at stadiums or 
other locations where more comfort in seating is desired than 
is provided.  Various types of portable sleeping mats/seating 
arrangements have heretofore been made available. One such 
application is in the mountain climbing, backpacking, and 
generally outdoor activity fields. As such, such portable 
sleeping mats/seating arrangements are preferably 
comparatively lightweight and are flexible so that they may be 
readily folded or rolled into a comparatively compact 
arrangement One such portable seating arrangement heretofore 
available had a flexible cover having a lower layer and an 
upper layer. The lower layer was continuous from one end to 
the other. The upper portion was divided along a central line 
extending between the peripheral edges and a flexible plastic 
foam pad was removably insertable through the slit in the 
upper layer. Such a seating arrangement folded along the 
slit. Large pockets were provided along the lateral 
peripheral edges of such a prior art seating arrangement and 
padded rigid members were insertable into the four pockets 
extending along the lateral edges from openings aligned with 
the slit in the upper layer. The pad was not bonded to the 
cover. At the top and bottom of the seating arrangement above 
described, flaps extending outwardly from the above-mentioned 
pockets were provided and straps were coupled to these flaps 
for detachable coupling together so that the back portion of 
the seating arrangement could move along a fold line towards  
 
and away from the seat portion and be restrained in any 
desired
