<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing a cocaine-protein conjugate 
easily by using a cocaine derivative having a methoxy 

carbonyl group and benzoyl group. This conjugate is 
useful for the detection of cocaine or cocaine 

derivatives. 
A monoclonal antibody, a monoclonal antibody producing 
cell line, and a method for producing the monoclonal 

antibody producing cell line by using the above cocaine-protein 
conjugate as an immunogen is also described. The 

method of the invention comprises preparing a cocaine-protein 
conjugate with a pyridyl dithiococaine derivative 

of Formula (1): 

which binds to a protein by a disulfide bond, immunizing 
A/J mouse with the conjugate, fusing its spleen cell and 

a myeloma cell line, cloning the fusion to produce a 
monoclonal antibody producing cell line, culturing the 

cell line, and purifying a supernatant of the culture to 
form a monoclonal antibody to specifically bind to 

cocaine or cocaine derivatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cocaine-protein
conjugate for use as an antigen to produce an anti-cocaine
antibody, a cocaine derivative as a starting
material for the conjugate, a monoclonal antibody
producing hybridoma cell line obtained from the antigen and a
monoclonal antibody produced by the hybridoma cell line. The
monoclonal antibody is useful in immunochemically
detecting cocaine or its derivative out of blood or air
with high sensitiveness.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., vol.199, p171 (1976) proposes
a synthesis of an anti-cocaine antibody for use in an
immunoassay for cocaine, and an antigen necessary in
preparing the antibody. The antibody reported is,
however, a polyclonal antibody which can be obtained from
refined blood of a goat or rabbit immunized using an
antigen of ecgonine of Formula (1). 
To obtain an anti-cocaine antibody highly specific for
cocaine, a cocaine-protein conjugate must be formed by
using a derivative keeping the cocaine framework as
precise as possible. Unfortunately, ecgonine lacks a
methoxycarbonyl group and benzoyl group each of them
characteristic of the cocaine molecule.The polyclonal antibodies of the prior art can simply
be prepared; on the other hand, it is less reproducible
because the properties of the product depend on every
individual of the experimental animals. Thus, it is
quite difficult to provide antibodies of the same
quality.Polyclonal antibodies are a mixture of a diversity of
antibodies having respective affinity. All the
affinities they have prevent us using a polyclonal antibody.
in a sensitive detection system because of their low
affinity for a molecule of interest. In accordance with
the above paper, we tried to obtain a monoclonal antibody 
of much affinity for cocaine; however, we could not
succeed because ecgonine as an antigen is too different
in structure from cocaine.U.S. Patent No. 4, 045, 420 provides cocaine derivatives with
non-oxo carbonyl functionalities for binding to proteins. These
derivatives are used as antigenic material for the production
of antibodies to ecgonine or cocaine.Chemical Abstract Vol. 118(3), 1993, 20930m discloses a
conjugate of ecgonine conjugated via its carboxy group to an
amino group of chicken Î³-globulin, bovine serum albumin or
shell hemocyanin for the production of anti-cocaine antibodies.U.S. Patent No. 3, 888, 866 discloses nitrogen derivatives of
benzoyl ecgonine and cocaine conjugated to antigenic proteins
for the formation of antibodies to benzoyl ecgonine and/or
cocaine. The invention aims to
