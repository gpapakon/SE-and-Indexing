<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a connection accessory for electrical apparatus, especially a circuit breaker, a contactor, a switch or the like. This accessory (11) includes a housing (20) in which are mounted a connection region (16), at least one main connecting case (21) which interacts with a clamping screw (22) in order to define, with this case, a main connection terminal (23) and at least one auxiliary connection terminal (24) which interacts with a clamping screw (25) in order to define, with this case, an auxiliary connection terminal (26). This accessory is designed to allow effective and reliable connection of at least one power cable and of at least one auxiliary conductor.
