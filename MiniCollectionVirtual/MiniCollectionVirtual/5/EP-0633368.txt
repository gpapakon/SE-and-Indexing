<ABSTRACT>
A shuttering board (1) has border profiles (2) which are arranged on parallel borders or run around all the borders and exhibit a hollow cross-section and each has a stop web (4) which forms the outermost border of the shuttering board (1) and is located at right angles to the shuttering skin (3). The stop web (4) may be laid closely against a corresponding stop web (4) or a border web (5), for example a flat border web (5) of a neighbouring shuttering board. The further webs of the hollow border profile (2) are, in this arrangement, formed by an approximately U-shaped cross-sectional profile (6) with two U-legs (7, 8) and a U-transverse web (29). In this arrangement, the stop web (4) engages over the borders of the U-legs (7, 8), and at least one U-leg, preferably the U-leg (7) further away from the shuttering skin (3), is fixedly connected, for example welded, to the stop web (4). In this arrangement, the stop web (4) has a fastening flange (9) which grips the shuttering skin (3) on the concrete side, in particular engages over the same, but is expediently sunk into the shuttering skin (3). The flange (9) forms, with the fastening web which is located nearest the shuttering skin (3), is in contact therewith, in the use position, on its side directed away from the concrete, is formed by the U-leg (8) and belongs to the border profile (2) and with that portion of the stop web (4) which is located inbetween, a groove (10) which receives the border of the shuttering skin (3), engages round the shuttering skin (3) on the border side and is clamped fixedly with the aid of screws which pass through it.

<CLAIMS>
A forming board (1) having, arranged at at least two 
parallel edges or running round all the edges, border 

sections (2) which present a hollow cross section and in 
each case have located at right angles to the lining skin 

(3) an abutment web (4) extending at the outermost edge 
of the forming board (1) and serving to be laid tightly 

against a corresponding abutment web (4) or border strip 
(5) of a neighbouring forming board, 
characterized in 
that
 the further webs of the border section (2) compose 
an approximately U-shaped section (6) with two U-limbs 

(7, 8) and a crosspiece (29), wherein the edges of the U-limbs 
(7, 8) are overlapped by the abutment web (4) and 

at least one U-limb (7) is firmly connected to the 
abutment web (4), that the abutment web (4) has a flange 

(9) engaging the side of the lining skin (3) facing the 
concrete, and that a groove (10) receiving the edge of 

the lining skin (3) is formed by the flange (9) together 
with the fastening web of the border section (2) and an 

intermediate portion of the abutment web (4), said 
fastening web being composed by one of the U-limbs (8) 

and being closest to the lining skin (3) and in the 
position of use bearing against the side of the lining 

skin (3) facing away from the concrete. 
A forming board as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the fastening web is movable relative to the back of 

the abutment web (4) and is elastically deformable or 
deflectable for clamping the lining skin (3) between 

itself and the flange (9) of the abutment web. 
A forming board as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that the fastening web (8) has tapped 

holes (11) and the fastening flange (9) sunk particularly  
 

into the lining skin (3) surface facing the concrete has 
holes (12) at registering height for inserting fastening 

screws/bolts (13) traversing the lining skin (3). 
A forming board as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the U-limb (7) remote from the 

lining skin (3) is connected, particularly welded, to the 
abutment web (4), particularly at the free edge thereof. 
A forming board as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that parts presenting an internal 

thread, or nuts, registering with through holes are 
arranged, e.g. welded, on the side remote from the lining 

skin (3). 
A forming board as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the fastening screws/bolts (13) 

have heads (15) sunk into the fastening flange (9) and 
are capable of being twisted relative to the thread of 

the tapped holes (11) and tightened for clamping the 
lining skin (3). 
A forming board as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the fastening web (9) which forms 

part of the border section (2) and presents the tapped 
holes (11) butts against the outside of the abutment web 

(4) without being fastened to the same. 
A forming board as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the abutment web (4) has 

perforations (16), keyhole-like or oblong perforations, 
for inserting connecting bolts (17) having at the end 

thereof at least one projection (18) which juts out 
radially from the cross section of the bolt and in the 

locking position or twisted position engages behind the  
 

edge of the perforations (16), the spacing and size of 
the perforations (16) in the abutment web (4) according 

with the corresponding dimensions of such perforations 
(19) in flat strips (5) composed of flat material edging 

forming boards, and that the clearance between the 
radially jutting out projection (18) and an axially 

spaced counter-stop (21), e.g. a disk spring or the like, 
of the connecting bolt corresponds to the overall 

thickness of a flat border strip (5) composed of flat 
material and an abutment web (4) of the hollow border 

section. 
A forming board as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the perforations (16) in the 

abutment web (4) are arranged within the border section 
(2) so close to the lining skin (3) and fastening web (8) 

that in the anchoring position the projection(s) (18) 
jutting out radially from the connecting bolt (17) reach 

interiorly up to the fastening web (8) or engage with a 
recess (22) provided in the fastening web (8) near the 

perforations (16) in the abutment web (4). 
A forming board as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the recesses (22) for projections 

(18) of connecting bolts (17) and the tapped holes (11) 
are staggered in the longitudinal direction of the border 

section (2).
