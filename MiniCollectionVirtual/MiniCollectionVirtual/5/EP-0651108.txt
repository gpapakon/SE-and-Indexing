<ABSTRACT>
This relates to the connection of two liners (13) using fishplates (30) which, arranged on either side of these liners (13), each include, at some distance from each other, two holed areas (33A, 33B) for fixing them to these liners (13). According to the invention, on the one hand, one of the holed areas (33A) of a fishplate (30) being intended to allow it to be fastened to one of the liners (13), the holes of the other of the holed areas (33B) are all longitudinally elongated in the form of slots, in order to allow free passage of the fixing members (35) ensuring corollary fastening of the other fishplate (30) to the other of the liners (13) and, on the other hand, each of the fishplates (30) includes a heel (42) for supporting a secondary liner (15). Application, in particular, to the construction of false ceilings.

A connector plate member for framework bar members to be paired 
with a connector plate member of the same type to enclose the bar members 

(13) to be connected and comprising at a spacing from each other two 
aperture zones (33A, 33B) each having at least one aperture (34A, 34B) for 

a fixing member (35) to pass therethrough, characterised in that on the 
one hand one of the aperture zones (33A) being intended to permit it to be 

fixed with respect to one of the bar members (13) the aperture or 
apertures (34B) of the other aperture zone (33B) are all elongated 

longitudinally in a buttonhole configuration to permit the free passage of 
the fixing member or members (35) which as a corollary provide for fixing 

the other connector plate member (30) to the other of the bar members (13) 
and on the other hand it comprises a lug (42) for supporting a secondary 

bar member (15). 
A connector plate member according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the lug (42) is operative by virtue of a recess (39) present along 

its lower edge. 
A connector plate member according to claim 2 characterised in 
that the lug (42) is in an eccentric position in the recess (39). 
A connector plate member according to either one of claims 2 
and 3 characterised in that, along a part at least of the bottom of its 

recess (39), it comprises a right-angled bent flange portion (43) produced 
by the recess (39) being cut out, for stiffening the connector plate 

member. 
A connector plate member according to any one of claims 2 to 4 
characterised in that, along a part at least of its lower edge it 

comprises a right-angled bent flange portion (46) on respective sides of 
its recess (39) for stiffening the connector plate member.  

 
A connector plate member according to any one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that between the aperture zones (33A, 33B) there is at 

least one additional aperture (36) which is elongated longitudinally in a 
buttonhole configuration for the passage of a connecting member (37) for 

making a connection to be established transversely from one of the 
connector plate members (30) to the other between the bar members (13). 
A connector plate member according to claim 6 characterised in 
that between the aperture zones (33A, 33B) there is at least one pair of 

supplementary apertures (36, 38) of which one only (36) is elongated in a 
buttonhole configuration and the other (38) is disposed in alignment with 

the former at a spacing therefrom. 
A connector plate member according to claim 7 characterised in 
that between the aperture zones (33A, 33B) there are at least two pairs 

of supplementary apertures (36, 38) which are displaced transversely in 
respect of height. 
A connector plate member according to any one of claims 1 to 8 
characterise in that, along a part at least of its upper edge, it 

comprises a U-shaped bend portion (48). 
A connector plate member according to any one of claims 1 to 9 
characterised in that at one of its ends to form a pivotal connection 

(51), it comprises an aperture (52) which, elongated in a buttonhole 
configuration, extends in a circular arc around a round aperture (53) on 

which it is centered. 
A connector plate member according to claim 10 characterised in 
that the edge of the pivotalconnection (51) that it forms is rounded, 

being centered on the round aperture (53), and, along a part at least of 
said edge, it comprises a right-angled bent flange portion (54) for 

stiffening it.  
 
A framework comprising at least two primary bar members (13) 
connected by two connector plate members according to one of claims 1 to 

11 and a secondary bar member (15) characterised in that the lug (42) is 
capable of latching engagement of the secondary bar member (15). 
A framework comprising at least two primary bar members (13) 
connected by two connector plate members according to one of claims 6 to 

8 characterised in that a connecting member (37) for making a connection 
to be established transversely from one of the connector plate members 

(30) to the other between the bar members (13) is associated with a 
supplementary aperture (36, 38) and that said connecting member (37) is a 

bolt whose nut (41) is a blind nut.
