<ABSTRACT>
A drill-probe for measuring the electric resistivity 
in a soil. 
The drill-probe bears on its external walls made of 
an insulating material (14) two groups of electrodes; 

with a four wire layout, the first group of 
electrodes (10, 11, 12, 13) measures the electric 

resistivity vertically and the second group of 
electrodes (15, 16) measures the electric resistivity 

horizontally; at the lower end of the probe a self-drilling 
device (1) is fitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a drill-probe for
the measurement of the electric resistivity of a
soil, especially that of an incoherent soil that is
water saturated, when one wants to find its density
for geo-technical purposes, and though this drill-probe
may conveniently be used also in non-saturated
soil for electric testing.The field of application of the probe invented is
mainly that of studies in the deformability and
resistance of foundation soils, two characteristics
that depend on the porosity of the soil (that
henceforth shall be designated by n) given by the
ratio between the volume of the interstices and the
total volume.In order to render the comprehension of the present
invention more immediate current knowledge concerning
the relationships existing between electric
resistivity and porosity of a soil are summarized
below.Given that, in general, the passage of electricity
through a soil takes place through the water in the
interstices and that, therefore, the electric
resistivity depends on:
the water content,the resistivity of the water itself, a function of 
the nature and concentration of the substances
dissolved in it, and the tortuousness of the electrical paths, 
if the degree of saturation of a soil is 100%, as is
in most sandy soils close to the sea or to a waterway,
then all the interstices are full of water and
the water content of that soil becomes an index of
its porosity, so that it is possible to express a
correlation between electric resistivity and
porosity. In order that said correlations be free of
the dependence on the water's resistivity one refers
to the "formation factor" (as per Anglo-Saxon
literature on the subject)
F = ρt / ρaρt = soil's electric resistivity including water in
the interstices, ρa = electric resistivity of the water in the
interstices. The ratio existing between F and n is:
F = n-f
in which f is a coefficient that depends on the
nature of the soil.The tortuousness of the electric paths is
functionally linked to the shape and orientation of
the solid particles and, therefore, ultimately, to 
the structure of the soil, so that it becomes
possible to define a vertical formation factor
Fv = ρv / ρa = n-f v,
a horizontal formation factor,
Fh = ρh / ρa = n-f h,
an average formation factor
Fav = (Fv + Fh) = n-f,
in which ρv and ρh represent the electric resistivity
of the soil vertically and horizontally,
respectively, fv and fh are constants to be
determined in the laboratory that depend on the
shape, dimensions and orientation of the particles.

A drill-probe for measuring the electric
resistivity of soil that comprises a cylindrical body

made of an insulating material (14) and bearing a
self-drilling system (1) in order to allow its being

sunk into the ground causing the least disturbance to
the same and including electrodes that measure the

resistivity both vertically and horizontally

characterized
 in that it carries upon its outside
wall, two groups of measuring electrodes, with a four

wire layout, the first of which (10, 11, 12, 13)
measures electric resistivity in a vertical direction

and the second (15, 16) the electric resistivity in
the horizontal direction, said first group consisting

of four electrodes two of which (12, 13) for
measuring voltage and two (10, 11) for measuring

current, both the electrodes for measuring voltage
are located between the two electrodes for measuring

current and each of them located close to one of the
latter and said second group consisting of at least

four electrodes (15, 16) positioned along a perimeter
of the probe in order to perform the measurement

along one half-plane only (S1, S2) defined by the
line L joining the centres of the current electrodes,

two (15) of the latter electrodes being located in 
diametrically opposite positions in order to function

as current electrodes and the other two (16) being
located on the same said half-plane (S1, S2) in order

to function as voltage electrodes.
A drill-probe according to claim 1 characterized
in that the current electrodes (10, 11) of said first

group are all the more distant from one another
however more one wishes to increase the range of the

measurement while complying with the condition that
the flow of current be fully closed from the positive

electrode to the negative electrode.
A drill-probe according to claim 1 characterized
in that the electrodes of said first group (10, 11)

are in the form of ring-plates.
A drill-probe according to claim 1 characterized
in that in said second group the two voltage

electrodes (16) are located as close as possible to
the current electrodes (15).
A drill-probe according to claims 1 and 4
characterized in that in said second group the

electrodes (16) for measuring voltage are four,
adjacent in pairs to a current electrode (15).
A drill-probe according to the above claims
characterized in that the electrodes in said second

group (15, 16) are located in the section half way 
between the current electrodes (10, 11) and are

electrically connected so as to contribute themselves
in the measurement of the electric resistivity

vertically.
A drill-probe according to claims 1, 4, 5 and 6
characterized in that the total number of electrodes

in said second group is eight (15, 16) four of which
are voltage electrodes (16) and four are current

electrodes (15), the voltage electrodes and the
current electrodes alternately placed and angularly

equidistant and located in the section half way
between the voltage electrodes (12, 13) of said first

group so as to be used to contribute also to the
measurement of electric resistivity vertically.
