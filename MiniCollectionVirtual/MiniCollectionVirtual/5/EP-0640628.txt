acrylic acid copolymer consisting of at least 80% of 

acrylic acid and containing less than 5 ppm of 
methylene chloride obtained by a process comprising the 

radicalic polymerisation of monomers in a solvent 
mixture consisting of a mixture of methylene chloride

wherein R is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl group, R₁ is 

C₁-C₃ alkyl group, wherein said solvent mixture consists 
of 60-75% v/v of methylene chloride and 40-25% v/v 

of carboxylic ester, or, alternatively, dimethyl or 
diethylcarbonate is used instead of the carboxylic 

ester, together with a crosslinking agent, in an amount 
from 0.3 and 4% w/w, calculated on the monomer, and an 

appropriate free radical initiator as catalyst at a 
temperature ranging from 35°C and reflux temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to crosslinked 
polyacrylic acids having low solvent residue, a process 
for the preparation thereof and to the use thereof as 
thickening agents. Polymers or copolymers of unsaturated carboxylic 
acids, crosslinked with olefinic polyfunctional compounds 
have been well known for a long time. The most typical monomers include acrylic, metacrylic, 
maleic, itaconic acids and their anhydrides. Omopolymer of acrylic acid or its copolymers containing 
till 20% of other monomers are particularly 
known. These last ones can be esters, such as alkyl 
acrylates, alkyl maleates, alkyl itaconates, or nitriles, 
such as acrylonitrile or amides such as acrylamide, 
maleimide. As crosslinking agent whatever polyfunctional monomer 
containing at least two end-chain vinylidenic 
groups can be used. Esters of acrylic or metacrylic 
acid with polyols, such as hexane diacrylate, trimethylolpropane 
triacrylate, pentaerythritol triacrylate 
or amides, such as methylene bisacrylamide or 
preferably polyalchenylpolyethers, such as butanediol 
diallylether, trimethylolpropane triallylether, 
pentaerythritol tetraallylether or saccharose 
polyallylethers. These polymers have been widely used as thickeners 
in different industrial fields.  If used in small amounts and particularly as salts 
with monovalent alkaline metals or amines, they can 
thicken water and organic solvents as well. There is a wide literature concerning both the 
preparation procedures of these polymers and their 
uses. They are mainly prepared by polymerization of monomers, 
with crosslinking agents in solvents in which 
monomers can be well soluble and polymers insoluble. As solvents, aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, 
ketones, esters, ethers, chlorinated hydrocarbons, and 
their mixtures, preferably with low boiling points can 
be used . The solvents used for the polymerization have a 
great influence on the features and quality of the obtained 
polymers. Generally, a polymer is considered good if it has 
the following features: 
a) high thickening capacity even at very low concentrations; b) soft and smooth appearance of the thickened formulates; c) very high trasparency of the aqueous gels; d) very low content of foreign matters, such as residues 
of monomers or solvents; e) it must be practically colourless and odourless.  These features depend only or mainly on the solvent 
used for the polymerization. The solvents that gave the best results till today, 
i.e. polymers having the optimal features previously 
described,
