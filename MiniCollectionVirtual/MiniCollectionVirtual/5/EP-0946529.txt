<ABSTRACT>
A process for making a 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one by cycling a bisamide precursor under alkaline conditions in the presence of oxygen or an oxygen-release compound in the presence of a nitrogen, sulphur or phosphorus nucleophile. Preferred nucleophiles are ammonia, primary, secondary and tertiary amines, amides, pyridines and quinolines.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for making 1,2-Benzisothiazolin-3-ones
(hereinafter BIT) by cyclising a bisamide precursor under alkaline conditions using oxygen
or an oxygen-release compound in the presence of a nitrogen, sulphur or phosphorus
nucleophile.EP 187,349 discloses a process for making BIT by disproportionation and
cyclisation of 2,2'-dithiobenzamide under alkaline conditions in the presence of oxygen or
an oxygen-release compound.It has now been found that the reaction rate may be significantly increased by
carrying out the disproportionation and cyclisation in the presence of a nitrogen, sulphur
or phosphorus nucleophile. In many instances the yield of the BIT is also significantly
increased.According to the invention there is provided a process for making a BIT of formula
1

wherein
R is hydrogen, aryl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl or C1-20-alkyl;X is halogen, nitro, cyano or C1-6-alkoxy; andn is 0-4;
   including salts thereof
which comprises reacting a bisamide precursor of formula 2

wherein
q is 0-3with oxygen or an oxygen-release compound under alkaline conditions in the
presence of a nitrogen, sulphur or phosphorus nucleophile substantially inert to 1,2-benzisothiazolinone.When R is aryl it is preferably phenyl.When R is aralkyl it is preferably benzyl or 2-phenylethyl. When R is cycloalkyl it preferably contains not greater than 10 and especially not
greater than 8 carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups are cyclopropyl and
cyclohexyl.When R is C1-20-alkyl, it may be linear or branched and is preferably C1-12- and
especially C1-10-alkyl. Examples of these alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, n-butyl,
tert -butyl, 2-methylbutyl, 2-ethylbutyl, 2-ethylhexyl, i-amyl, i-hexyl, n-hexyl and n-octyl.Halogen is bromine, fluorine and especially chlorine.When present, the substituent X is located preferably in the 5- or 6-position of the
BIT molecule and especially in the 6-position.It is preferred, however, that n is zero.The salts of BIT of formula 1 may be those of an inorganic or organic acid such as
acetic, propionic, sulphuric, phosphoric or hydrochloric acid. However, when R is
hydrogen, the BIT may also form a salt with a cation such as an ammonium or alkali
metal cation. Preferred alkali metal cations are those obtainable from the alkali metal
hydroxides. Preferred alkali metals are lithium, potassium and especially sodium.The bisamide of formula 2 is preferably a 2,2'-dithiobenzamide (q is zero) but may
include higher sulphur analogues (q is 1 or more) including mixtures
