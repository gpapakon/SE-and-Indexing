<CLAIMS>
Use of an adsorber prepared from a high temperature-resistant
zeolite or from a mixture of different high

temperature-resistant zeolites, for protecting from
catalyst poisons a catalytic converter for purifying

combustion engine exhaust gases.
Use according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
adsorber is present as a coating on a monolithic

support body of honeycomb form which is located
upstream of the catalytic converter in the exhaust gas

stream.
Use according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
adsorber is applied as a coating to the actual

catalytic coating of the catalytic converter.
Use according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that dealuminised mordenite, dealuminised type Y

zeolite and/or zeolite ZSM-5 having SiO
2
 to Al
2
O
3
 molar
ratios greater than 8 are utilised as zeolites.
Use according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
zeolites used are doped with doping elements, in

particular with the elements from the group comprising
Cu, Fe, Na and/or K, or are present in the acid H form.
Use according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
zeolites used are doped within their ion exchange

capacity with the doping elements.
