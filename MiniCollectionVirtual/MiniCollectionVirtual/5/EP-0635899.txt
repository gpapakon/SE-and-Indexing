<ABSTRACT>
A microstrip array antenna consisting of a multilayer 
structure and of a carrier structure to which the connector 

and the multilayer structure are secured, made up of a first 
layer comprising the microstrip feed network, of a second 

layer made up of a grounded metal plane, periodically punched, 
and of a third layer comprising the array of radiating 

metal elements some of which are not fed and are placed along 
one or more perimeters around the array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to devices for microwave 
telecommunication systems and more particularly it concerns 
a microstrip array antenna. Microstrip array antennas are microwave directive 
antennas, which can be advantageously used as antennas in 
telecommunication networks both for point-to-point and point-to-multipoint 
links, for services such as speech, data, 
video, and in the mobile radio network for base stations and 
for interconnection between the base stations themselves. They are provided to be used for the radio links of the 
national telephone service in frequency bands around 19, 28 
and 38 GHz, where the required bandwidths are of about 2 GHz. These antennas are also specially suitable for use in 
the urban areas thanks to their planar structure enabling 
very reduced volumes and weights to be obtained. Their small 
thickness, just a few centimeters, makes them easy to camouflage 
and they can therefore be mounted without altering the 
characteristics of the structure where they are placed and 
this lets the specially critical environmental constraints in 
urban area be overcome. Moreover, manufacturing costs are much lower than those 
of an equivalent reflector antenna. The main purpose in designing microstrip array antennas 
is to obtain radiating characteristics which can be compared 
with those of reflector antennas having the same dimensions.  
 
More particularly, the most critical requirements are the 
reduction of the side lobes, the gain for the required 
bandwidth, the symmetry of the main lobe in E and H-planes 
and the reduction of return losses. High gains are obtained by means of arrays made up of 
many radiating elements, even a thousand, fed by a proper 
microstrip network, the task of which is to equally share the 
power among all the elements. A microstrip array antenna has been described in the 
paper "Wideband Aperture-coupled Microstrip Patch Array for 
Satellite TV Reception", by F. Rostan and alii, published in 
the Proceedings of the Eighth International Conference on 
"Antennas and Propagation", 30 March-2 April 1993, Edinburgh, 
UK. This antenna, designed for direct TV reception from 
satellite, was built in two experimental versions, one made 
up of an 8x8 element array and the other made up of a 16x16 
element array. Measurements carried out on the second version 
of 16x16 elements, show a reflection coefficient lower than 
-20 dB only for a 3% bandwidth and a non perfectly symmetrical 
radiation lobe in E and H-planes. These performances are 
admissible

<CLAIMS>
A microstrip array antenna made up of: 

a first layer (2), made up of a dielectric sheet on 
which the microstrip feed network is made, obtained 

by a periodical repetition of successive 3dB power 
splitters ending in matching and coupling circuits; 
a second layer (3), made up of a ground metallic 
plane, periodically punched by rectangular slots; 
a third layer (4), made up of a dielectric sheet on 
which the radiating metallic element array is made, 

resonant at wavelength Î» and fed by the feed network 
made on the first layer (2) through the slots carried 

out in the second layer (3); 
a carrier structure (1), made up of a metallic box 
provided with a bottom wall and side walls to which 

the layer succession (2, 3, 4) and a connector (CO) 
connected to the fee
d network are secured; 
 
characterized in that non-fed resonant metallic elements 

are located along one or more perimeters round said 
radiating element array made on the third layer (4) and 

the metallic plane of second layer (3) extends below said 
non-fed resonant metallic elements. 
A microstrip array antenna as in claim 1, characterized 
in that on the third layer (4) is placed a further layer 

containing an array of radiating metallic elements 
similar to that already present on the said third layer.
