<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a game apparatus and a game 
system, such as a slot machine, for a player to play games with 
game play media in a game play media tray and paying out prizes 
to the player for winning game plays. With a conventional game machine and game play media 
lender, for example, a player inserts a prepaid card storing the 
amount of money into a slot of the game play media lender and 
operates a switch to borrow game play media. Then, the player 
places the game play media in the game play media tray of a 
game machine. In this condition, the player loads necessary game 
play media into the game machine so as to play a game. If the 
player satisfies a given condition in the process of the game, he or 
she wins the game and receives game play media for the winning 
game play from the game machine. For adjustment, the player loads the paid-out game play 
media for winning game plays into a counter. The counter counts 
the number of the loaded game play media, prints the result on a 
receipt, and discharges the receipt to the outside. The player 
receives the receipt on which the count is recorded from the  
 
counter. He or she goes to a prize exchange counter or window 
for exchanging the receipt for prizes. However, in the related art, the player first needs to 
purchase a prepaid card and from the beginning of a game to 
prize exchange, it requires time and effort for the player to 
receive game play media from the game play media lender and 
move them to the game play media tray of a game machine and 
finally to move paid-out game play media for winning game 
plays to the counter from the game play media tray. WO-A-91/02572 discloses a pinball machine control system 
using prepaid cards. The pinball machine control system 
comprises pinball machines to be played with the use of 
prepaid cards, and control units for controlling the pinball 
machines. A pinball machine possesses such functions as 
reading and writing data from and into a prepaid card, 
issuing balls on the basis of said data recorded in the 
prepaid card, and calculating the number of balls varying 
with the progress of playing. A control unit sorts data read 
out from the pinball machine and the result of calculation of 
the number of balls and stores them for respective prepaid 
cards so as to administrate information on balls. However, 
with this known control system it is not possible to play the 
game without using a prepaid card. That is, balls cannot be 
used in the game system. Therefore, when the prepaid
