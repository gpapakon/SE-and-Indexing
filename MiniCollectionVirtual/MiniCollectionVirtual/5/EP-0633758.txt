<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an absorbent wound dressing which comprises a layer of hydrophobic silicone gel (3) which is intended to lie against the wound surface when the dressing is worn, a layer of carrier material (2; 7) which carries the gel layer and affords the requisite strength thereto, and an absorbent body (5) which is placed on that side of the carrier material and gel layer which lie distal from the wound surface in use, wherein the carrier material and the gel layer have mutually coinciding penetrating perforations (4) at least within the region of the absorbent body. According to the invention, a fluid barrier layer (6) is provided on that side of the dressing which lies distal from the wound surface in use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorbent wound dressing 
comprising a layer of hydrophobic silicone gel which is intended 
to lie against the wound surface in use, a layer of 
carrier material which carries the gel layer and affords the 
requisite strength to said layer, and an absorbent body which 
is placed on that side of the carrier material and gel layer 
which lies distal from the wound surface in use, wherein the 
carrier material and the gel layer have mutually coinciding 
penetrating perforations at least within the region of the 
absorbent body. Applicant's EP-A-0 261 167 discloses a wound 
dressing which is comprised of a textile material that has been 
impregnated with silicone gel. The silicone gel may be comprised 
of a hydrophobic silicone gel of the same type as that 
used in the dressing Mepitel® retailed by Applicant. The patent 
specification mentions the possibility of using this wound 
dressing together with an absorbent body when the dressing is 
used for weeping wounds or sores. In order to ensure that the 
absorbent body will remain seated in the wound area in such 
applications, it is necessary to secure the body with a retaining 
layer after having applied the absorbent body to the wound, 
this retaining layer conveniently having the form of an elastic 
bandage. This use of Applicant's Mepitel® dressing is highly 
appropriate in the case of heavily weeping wounds or sores, 
when the absorbent body needs to be changed at given intervals, 
since the Mepitel® dressing can be left on the wound or sore 
during several absorbent body changes, which is particularly 
beneficial in the case of sensitive wounds. In the case of 
other applications, and particularly those applications when 
the entire dressing shall be removed after a given period of 
time, the aforesaid method of application can be experienced as 
troublesome and time-consuming. Furthermore, in the case of 
this kind of dressing, there is a risk that fluid from the 
wound will leak from the absorbent body and the retaining layer 
and fasten on the clothes of the person carrying the dressing. 
Furthermore, there is always a risk of infecting the wound when  
 
the dressing is removed. The object of the present invention is to provide an absorbent 
wound dressing of the kind defined in the introduction which 
can be easily applied and which will fully eliminate, or at 
least greatly eliminate the risk of fluid leaking from the 
dressing. In accordance with the invention, this object is achieved with 
an absorbent wound

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent wound dressing comprising a layer of hydrophobic 
silicone gel (3) which is intended to lie against the wound 

surface when the dressing is worn, a layer of carrier material 
(2; 7) which supports the gel layer and whic
h affords the 
necessary strength to said layer, and an absorbent body (5) 

which is placed on that side of the carrier material and gel 
layer which lies distal from the wound surface in use, wherein 

the carrier material and gel layer have mutually coinciding 
penetrating perforations (4) at least within the region of the 

absorbent body, 
characterized
 in that a fluid 
barrier layer (6) is provided on that side of the dressing 

which lies distal from the wound surface in use and in that 
within the region of the absorbent body (5), the fluid barrier 

layer (6) is preshaped to a form which is complementary to the 
form of the absorbent body projecting out from the layers of 

carrier material (2; 7) and gel layer. 
An absorbent wound dressing according to Claim 2, 

characterized
 in that the fluid barrier layer (6) 
is preshaped to a form which is complementary to the absorbent 

body subsequent to said body being saturated with absorbed 
wound fluid. 
An absorbent wound dressing according to any one of Claims 
1-3, 
characterized
 in that the fluid barrier 
layer (6) is comprised of a fluid-impervious plastic film. 
An absorbent wound dressing according to any one of Claims 
1-3, 
characterized
 in that the fluid barrier 
layer (6) is comprised of a microporous material. 
An absorbent wound dressing according to any one of Claims 
1-4, 
characterized
 in that the fluid barrier 
layer (6) is coated with a silicone primer on that side which 

faces towards the silicone-gel carrier-material (2; 7). 
An absorbent wound dressing according to any one of the  
 

preceding Claims, 
characterized
 in that the 
carrier material is comprised of a textile material (2) that 

has been impregnated with silicone gel (3). 
An absorbent wound dressing according to any one of Claims 
1-6, 
characterized
 in that the carrier material 
is comprised of a totally or essentially air-impervious and 

fluid-impervious perforated layer material (7) to which a layer 
(3) of silicone gel is adhered.
