<ABSTRACT>
When liquid/solid mixtures are separated in centrifuges, in particular in worm centrifuges, with the objective of recovering the liquid phase as a valuable material, discharging the liquid via skimmers frequently leads to eddying of the liquid with the gas (normally air) present in the centrifuge, which can lead to an undesired high degree of foam formation and to an undesired reaction of the gas with the liquid. According to the invention, in order to prevent this eddying it is proposed to construct the skimmer (14) from at least two individual discs (15, 16) which can be rotated with respect to one another and form between them at least one skimming duct (20) whose cross-sectional area can be adjusted by rotating the individual disks (15, 16) and can thus be adapted to the rate of discharge.
