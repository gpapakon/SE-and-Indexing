<ABSTRACT>
A method of securing one end (20) of a boot 
(18) of a universal joint (10) comprising the steps of 

positioning said one end of the boot around a portion 
(14) of the universal joint; positioning a ring clamp 

(22) having an internal diameter greater than the 
external diameter of the portion of the universal 

joint around said one end of the boot; and swaging the 
ring clamp to compress the ring clamp onto the boot to 

secure said one end of the boot on the portion of the 
universal joint and to form teeth (32) of 

predetermined shape, size and separation in an outer 
surface (34) of the ring clamp. Easier assembly of 

combined securing clamp and rotational speed sensing 
ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
securing a boot of a universal joint of a motor
vehicle using a ring clamp in which the ring clamp can
additionally act as a toothed ring of a rotational
speed sensor for, for example, an anti-lock braking
system and/or a traction control system for the motor
vehicle.GB 2,186,037A discloses a known arrangement
for a universal joint. The boot is secured in place
at one end on an outer joint member by a ring clamp
which may be provided with teeth for a rotational
speed sensing system. In this known arrangement, the
ring clamp has an internal diameter which is slightly
smaller than the external diameter of the outer joint
member prior to installation. The ring clamp is slid
in an axial direction into position, and expanded to
secure one end of the boot. This arrangement is a
difficult assembly process, can cause damage to the
boot, and can distort the shape and separation of the
teeth (thereby resulting in inaccuracy of the sensed
speed).The object of the present invention is to
overcome the above problems.A method of securing one end of a boot of a
universal joint in accordance with the present
invention comprises the steps of positioning said one
end of the boot around a portion of the universal
joint; positioning a ring clamp having an internal
diameter greater than the external diameter of the
portion of the universal joint around said one end of
the boot; and swaging the ring clamp to compress the
ring clamp onto the boot to secure said one end of the
boot on the portion of the universal joint and to form 
teeth of predetermined shape, size and separation in
an outer surface of the ring clamp.This arrangement has the advantage of
providing an easier method of attaching the ring clamp
and reduces the risk of damaging the boot. Further,
the swaging step, which is the final step, ensures
that the teeth are accurately formed to the required
shape, size and separation for a rotational speed
sensor.The present invention will now be described,
by way of example, with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 is a side view of a universal joint
of a motor vehicle including a boot in which one end
of the boot is secured in place by a ring clamp in
accordance with the present invention;Figure 2 is a schematic view of the
universal joint of Figure 1 prior to swaging the ring
clamp;Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view of the
ring clamp of Figure 2 taken on the line III-III;Figure 3A is an enlarged view of a portion
of the ring clamp of Figure 3 with a portion

outer surface (34) of the ring clamp.
A method as claimed in claim 1
comprising pre-forming teeth (32') in the outer

surface (34') of the ring clamp (22')prior to swaging,
the swaging step adjusting the teeth (32) to the

predetermined shape, size and separation.
