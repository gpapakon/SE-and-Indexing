<ABSTRACT>
A method for carrying out a wirefree data exchange between a fixed station (4) and transmitting/receiving devices (3) on board objects which move relative to the fixed station (4), preferably in lanes (6), in particular motor vehicles (1), with the aid of an antenna arrangement (5) of the fixed station (4) whose transmitting and/or receiving profile can be directed electronically at an object (1), permits a reliable location determination with the aid of the antenna arrangement due to the fact that in a first phase a search area (7) is scanned and monitored for response signals from objects (1) by means of a varying alignment of the transmitting and/or receiving profile, the instant when a response signal is received being correlated with the instantaneous setting values (w(t)) of the transmitting and/or receiving profile for the purpose of location determination, and that in a second phase the transmitting and/or receiving profile is fixed to a transmitting/receiving device (3), which has been determined in the search area (7) in terms of location, of an object (1) and is, if necessary, adjusted while the data exchange takes place.

Method for carrying out wireless data exchange
between a fixed station (4) and transceiving units (3) on

board objects, in particular vehicles (1), moving
relative to the fixed station (4), preferably in lanes

(6), with the aid of an antenna arrangement (5) of the
fixed station (4), whose transmitting and/or receiving

profile can be aligned electronically with an object (1),
characterized in that a search area (7) is swept in a

first phase by a varying alignment of the transmitting
and/or receiving profile and is checked for response

signals from objects (1), the instant of the reception of
a response signal being correlated with the instantaneous

setting values (w(t)) of the transmitting and/or receiving
profile for the purpose of determining position, and

in that in a second phase the transmitting and/or receiving
profile is fixed on a transceiving unit (3) of an

object (1), which unit is determined in the search area
(7) with regard to its position, while the data exchange

is undertaken.
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in
that in the second phase the transmitting and/or receiving

profile tracks the transceiving unit (3) of the
object (1).
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the search area (7) is swept several times for

the purpose of more accurately determining the position
or a direction of movement of transceiving units (3) of

objects (1).
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that in the case of repeated sweeping of the search area

(7) a changed alignment of the transmitting and/or
receiving profile is used.
Method according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized
in that in the case of repeated sweeping the search area

(7) is swept only partly.
Method according to one of Claims 3 to 5, characterized
in that repeated sweeping of the search area (7)

is performed at a different rate than the previous
sweeping.
Method according to one of Claims 3 to 6, characterized
in that repeated sweeping is controlled as a

function of response signals received during previous
sweeping.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterized
in that estimation of the speed of the determined

object (1) is undertaken in the first phase.
Method according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the tracking of the transmitting and/or receiving

profile in the second phase is undertaken using the
estimated speed.
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterized
in that an amplitude of the received response

signal is also determined in the first phase.
