<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to systems for measuring electrical
signals from electronic or optoelectronic devices and systems, and more particularly,
to an electrode structure having a contact electrode for receiving the signals to be
measured, and interdigitated electrode structure forming a metal-semiconductor-metal
photoconductive gate, and an output electrode.There is a need for an arrangement which can communicate directly with one
or more portions of a circuit to be tested, such as an integrated circuit, and
particularly for facilitating internal node testing within very large scale integration
(VLSI) systems. Such node testing requires compliance with increasingly
challenging specifications, since VLSI systems are increasing in circuit component
density, and soon will have electrode dimensions nearing 0.1 µm. Additionally, such
VLSI systems will soon be operating at very high speeds, on the order of 50 ps and
below. Known measurement systems fall short, by at least an order of magnitude
of reaching both of these benchmarks simultaneously.In addition to achieving communication with specific nodes within a VLSI
system, and achieving the high gate speeds necessary to achieve meaningful
measurements, it is essential that the measuring system be nondisturbing, in several
senses. First, the measurement system should have a high electrical impedance so
as not to produce loading of the integrated circuit components. Such electrical
loading not only disturbs the circuit under test whereby the results obtained are
representative of the operation of the circuit, but also present a danger to the circuit 
under test since such high density systems operate at extremely small currents. In
addition, it is crucial that the measurement system not disturb the integrated circuit
mechanically. It is well known that the internal mechanical structures of integrated
circuits, particularly VLSI systems are extremely small and fragile.A system for measuring signals in integrated circuitry should, in addition to
the foregoing, produce absolute voltage measurements, including DC-offsets. In this
manner, a true representation of the electrical activity within the integrated circuit
is achieved. Such measurements should additionally be free of cross-talk from
adjacent electrode structures.With respect to temperature, there is a need for a system which can function
at ambient temperatures and pressures which are elevated and fluctuating.
Oftentimes, elevation in temperature is produced by the circuit under test, and
