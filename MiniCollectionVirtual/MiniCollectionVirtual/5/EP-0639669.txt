<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating agent for 
paper and, more specifically, to a paper coating agent 
having excellent applicability through blade coaters or roll 
coaters. Polyvinyl alcohol (hereinafter referred to as "PVA") 
has been widely used as a clear coating agent to improve the 
surface characteristics of paper, such as smoothness, luster 
and barrier properties, and as a binder for pigment coating. 
PVA is known to have excellent film formability and 
strength and is unrivaled by any other sizing agent with 
respect to these points. However, as in recent years the application speed has 
been increased or novel application processes have appeared such 
as application with a roll coater, there have occurred several 
problems associated with conventional aqueous PVA solutions (see e.g. US-A- 5057570), 
which obstruct stable and uniform application. The problems 
are viscosity increase (dilatancy) under high shear rate 
conditions with a blade coater, or formation of streaks or 
generation of mist-like scattering upon high-speed roll 
application. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to 
provide a PVA-based paper coating agent that has excellent  
 
applicability, while maintaining the above features of PVA, 
i.e. good film formability and strength. As a solution of the above object, it has been 
found that a particulate PVA having an average 
particle diameter of 0.01 to 1 µm can, while being 
substantially insoluble and maintaining a slurry state when 
placed in cold water, dissolve during drying process after 
application and form a film. Thus, the present invention provides a paper coating 
agent, which comprises an aqueous slurry containing a dispersion of a particulate polyvinyl 
alcohol having a degree of polymerization of more than 500 and an average 
particle diameter of 0.01 to 1 µm (preferably 0.1 to 1 µm, 
more preferably 0.2 to 0.9 µm). The particulate PVA used in the present invention may 
have any viscosity-average degree of polymerization (hereinafter 
simply referred to as "degree of polymerization") with 
no specific limitation, but it preferably has a degree of 
polymerization of at least 550, more preferably at least 700 
and most preferably at least 1,000, in view of the strength 
properties of papers coated with the PVA. The degree of 
polymerization also has no specific upper limit, but it is 
preferably not more than 30,000, more preferably not more 
than 20,000. The degree of saponification of the PVA has no specific  
 
limitation either, but it is
