<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for measuring the shape of a surface of, for example, a metal strip moving over a support surface comprises a laser operable to direct onto the surface of the moving strip a plurality of light beams. From these laser-generated light beams a plurality of light patterns are produced each of which is scanned across the width of the strip and is spaced from the other light patterns in the direction of strip movement. An array of line-scan cameras extends across the width of the strip and is positioned to view and record the projected light patterns. Recorded data from the camera array is processed in parallel to provide a measure of the shape of the strip surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of determining the 
shape of objects and to apparatus for use therewith. More 
especially, the invention concerns methods of and 
apparatus for determining the manifest flatness of sheets 
and strips of metallic material, e.g. steel. Steel strip and sheet (hereinafter referred to 
collectively as "steel strip") is conventionally produced 
by hot or cold rolling a semi-finished product (eg a bar) 
in a multi-stand rolling mill. The flatness of steel strip 
so produced is, of course. potentially of importance to 
the end user. The measurement of strip flatness is, 
however, hindered by the high operational speeds of 
conventional rolling mills. There is, consequently, a need 
for a method of and apparatus for rapidly measuring the 
flatness of the strip leaving a rolling mill. One technique which has been commonly employed is  
 
that of illuminating the strip with a laser generated 
light beam and observing the position of the beam on the 
strip with a television area camera. The computing power 
required to analyse a television picture rapidly is, 
however, considerable and costly. Also, with less rapid 
computing power, the interval between measurements is 
likely to be much longer than is desirable to provide a 
true indication of flatness. Various optical profile measurement 
devices are known eg US 5 056 922, which uses 
coplanar light beams arranged in the same plane 
to measure profiles of moving objects. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
method of and apparatus for rapidly measuring the shape of 
an object, especially the manifest flatness of a strip of 
steel or other material. According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided apparatus for measuring the shape of 
a surface of an object, the apparatus being characterised 
by laser means operable to direct onto a surface of an 
object moving relative to the laser means a plurality of 
light beams spaced one from another in the direction of 
movement of the object to produce on the object surface a 
plurality of light patterns which extend across the object 
in a direction generally normal to the direction of 
movement of the object, scanning means for scanning the 
laser-generated light beams continuously across the object 
surface in a direction generally normal to the direction 
of movement of the object, and an array of line-scan 
cameras positioned to view and record the said light 
patterns and to process in parallel the recorded data to 
provide a measure of the
