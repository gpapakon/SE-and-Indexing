<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an individual 
identification label which is utilized for the management of 
various kinds of individuals such as products, materials, etc. An individual identification label is a label prepared 
by recording a prescribed individual identification information 
on the surface of a substrate comprising a plastic film, etc., 
using patterns such as characters, numbers, bar codes, etc., 
and is used by adhering the same to an individual object. In the management of individuals using this kind of 
label, the case sometimes occurs that the label cannot help 
using in a high temperature (e.g., from 200 to 300°C) 
atmosphere, whereby an individual identification label having 
a heat resistance becomes necessary. A label prepared by forming a heat-resistant resin 
layer comprising a polyimide resin or a polyamide resin 
containing a white pigment on the surface of a substrate 
comprising a polyimide film and forming thereon a black pattern 
showing an individual identification information with a heat-transfer 
ink has been practically used at present as the 
individual identification label having such a heat resistance. However, the heat resistance of the ink used for the 
pattern-forming portion of the individual identification 
information is insufficient since in the above-described  
 
conventional individual identification label, there is a 
problem that it is difficult for the individual identification 
label to endure the use thereof for a long period of time under 
a high temperature atmosphere of from 200 to 300°C. An object of the present invention is to overcome the 
above-described problem and to provide an individual 
identification label having an excellent heat resistance 
capable of sufficiently enduring the use thereof in a high 
temperature atmosphere for a long period of time. It has now been found that the above object can be 
achieved by the present invention described hereinbelow. That is, according to the present invention, there is 
provided an individual identification label having an 
individual identification information recorded on the surface 
of a substrate, wherein the substrate comprises a metal plate 
or a metal foil and the individual identification information 
is formed by a polyimide resin. Figure 1 is a plane view showing the individual 
identification label of the present invention shown in Example 
1, and Figure 2 is an enlarged cross sectional view of the 
individual identification label shown in Fig. 1. The present invention is described

<CLAIMS>
An individual identification label comprising a 
substrate having an individual identification information 

recorded on the surface thereof, wherein the substrate 
comprises a metal plate or a metal foil and the individual 

identification information is formed by a polyimide resin. 
A label as claimed in claim 1, wherein said metal 
plate or metal foil has a surface gloss of from 70 to 250% 

measured according to JIS Z8741. 
A label as claimed in claim 1, wherein said metal 
plate or metal foil has an average surface roughness of from 

0.1 to 10 µm.

polyimide resin is a photosensitive polyimide resin selected 

from the group consisting of a resin having a structural unit 
represented by formula (I): 

 
wherein the arrows each indicates a bond which can be 

substituted by isomerization, R₁ represents a tetravalent 
aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon residue, and R₂ represents
 a 
divalent aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon residue, a compound 

represented by formula (II):

group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R₅ and R₆ each is one member 
selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group or an 

alkoxyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, anilino group, 
toluidino group, benzyloxy group, amino group, and a 

dialkylamino group, and X₁ to X₄ each is one member selected 
from the group consisting of hydrogen atom, fluorine atom, 

nitro group, methoxy group, a dialkylamino group, amino group, 
cyano group, and a fluoroalkyl group, and a compound 

represented by formula (III): 

 

wherein R₇ and R₈ each represents hydrogen atom or an alkyl 
group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, R₉ and R₁₀ each is one member 

selected from the group consisting of hydrogen atom, cyano 
group, acetyl group, amide group, and a group of the formula 

COOR₁₁ wherein R₁₁ is one member selected from the group 
consisting of an alkyl group or an alkoxyl group having 1 to 5 

carbon atoms, anilino group, toluidino group, and benzyloxy 
group, and X₅ is one member selected from the group consisting 

of hydrogen atom, fluorine atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 
carbon atoms, a fluoroalkyl group, and phenyl group. 
A process for producing an individual identification 
label, which comprises forming a photosensitive polyimide resin 

film on a surface of a metal plate or foil as a substrate, 
irradiating the film with an actinic light through a mask, and 

post-developing the substrate. 
A semiconductor device comprising a flat package in 
which at least 50% of a surface thereof is covered with a metal 

plate or foil.
