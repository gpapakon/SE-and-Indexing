<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for locking windows, doors or the like, having at least one base plate, exhibiting a bearing eyelet, and a pin which is mounted in said base plate and passes through a securing plate, it being possible to arrest the pivoting capacity of the securing plate by actuating an actuating part designed, in particular, as a pressure cylinder. In order to achieve a spatially smaller structural form, the intention being for the opening/rotary forces acting in the locking position not to have an effect on the pressure cylinder, the invention proposes that, by virtue of axial displaceability, it be possible to move at least one pin portion of the pivot pin of the securing plate into positively locking engagement with respect to the bearing hollow of the bearing eyelet.

Device for the locking of windows, doors or the like 
with a base plate having at least one bearing eyelet, and 

a shaft supported in the bearing eyelet and passing through 
a securing plate, it being possible to block the ability of 

the securing plate to pivot by operating an actuating 
component constructed especially as a pressure cylinder, 

characterised by an axially displaceable shaft section (19, 
30) deviating from the circular cross-sectional contour, 

which for achieving the blocking action works together with 
a bearing cavity (31) of the securing plate (8) adapted to 

the cross section and a region (17, 18) of the bearing 
eyelet (10, 11) adapted to the cross section. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that for 
achieving the blocking action the shaft section deviating 

from the non-circular is displaced in a part region of the 
bearing eyelet adapted to the cross section. 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims in that at least two bearing eyelets are provided 

between which the shaft extends. 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a shaft section works 

together with a part region on the end face of a bearing 
cavity (31) of the securing plate (8) adapted to the cross 

section and/or one from a part region (17, 18) of the 
bearing eyelet (10, 11) adapted to the cross section. 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that two shaft sections (19, 30) 

separated by a cylindrical intermediate region (20) are 
provided. 
Device according to one or several of the preceding  
 

claims, characterised in that the shaft sections (19, 30) 
possess a polygonal, preferably square, contour. 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one shaft section 

(30) is arranged in freely rotatable manner on the shaft 
(x-x). 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a bearing collar (24) which is 

allocated at one end to a shaft section (30) and in the 
non-blocking shaft position lies in a bearing eyelet (11). 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the bearing collar (24) is 

designed in cylindrical manner and is adapted in diameter 
to the internal diameter of the square opening of the 

bearing eyelet (11). 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the bearing cavity (31) is 

formed in the securing part (8) by a square hollow section 
(32). 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a slot (35) extending in the 

circumferential direction of the bearing cavity (31) and 
forming two limit stop edges (33, 34) for the entrance of 

a limit stop pin (36) emanating from the base plate (9). 
Device according to one or several of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the width of the base plate 

(9) corresponds to the overall size of the square hollow 
section (32).
