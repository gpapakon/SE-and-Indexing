<ABSTRACT>
A data-collection and monitoring system for a production 
line ensures the traceability, that is, the detailed 

reconstruction, of the entire production process for each 
finished product output by the line, by the separate filing 

of data relating to the manufacturing steps and to the 
products, with the use of time as the unifying factor. 

The system advantageously provides for the two sets of data 
to be correlated only when necessary, permitting 

considerably savings in both hardware and software 
requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to data-collection
systems associated with industrial production lines and,
more specifically, to a data-collection system which
ensures the traceability of the products of an industrial
line.The English term "traceability" means the ability to
reconstruct the entire production process for each finished
product output by the production line, that is, to identify
all the components making up the finished product, and
their origin, as well as all the manufacturing steps which
the finished product has undergone, with their operating
conditions.The importance of the use of a system of this type in
current industrial production lines is thus clear,
particularly as far as the operations affecting the
reliability and quality of the products are concerned.According to the prior art, a system which performs these
functions may be implemented, for example, by recording all
the data relating to the production conditions of each
product passing along the production line during
production. The recording may take place in a database of
known type, for example, a relational database. Whilst
this solution has the merit of being essentially simple,
practically it is not feasible.In fact, the quantity of data to be recorded in order to
control data relating to each individual product of a
modern industrial production line is typically of the order 
of several millions of crude data, such as, for example,
identification codes, per day. Such a quantity of data
causes the cost of the hardware and software necessary for
collection and subsequent retrieval to become prohibitive
if compared with the cost of the production line itself.Moreover, even supposing that such a mass of data were
recorded, it would assume dimensions such as to be
intractable, that is, it would become impossible to gain
access to the data of interest within a reasonable time.The object of the present invention is to provide a data-collection
system which solves all the problems indicated
above in a satisfactory manner.According to the present invention, this object is achieved
by virtue of a data-collection system having the
characteristics indicated in the claims which follow the
present description. A further subject of the invention
is the related method.Further advantages and characteristics of the present
invention will become clear from the following detailed
description given with the aid of the appended Figure 1,
which is provided by way of non-limiting example and shows
schematically, in block form, an
