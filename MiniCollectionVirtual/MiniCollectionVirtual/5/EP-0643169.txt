<ABSTRACT>
The arrangement for joining rails tied on a support structure, especially bridge support structure, to rails (11) continuing on the foundation (5) or land has an expansion device (3) in which the expansion gap is bridged, in the region between the end girder (2) of the support structure and the foundation (5), by transverse girders and sleepers (6, 8), respectively, extending transversely to the rail longitudinal direction, the transverse girders and sleepers (6, 8) being slidingly supported on a part of the end girders (2) of the support structure or of the foundation (5), respectively, and, in addition, the rails being supported on the transverse girders and sleepers (6, 8) respectively.

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for joining rails defined on a supporting 
structure, in particular, a supporting structure of a bridge 

with rails continuing on the foundation or land, using a 
dilatation means (3) for absorbing movements in the 

longitudinal direction of the rails, characterized in that 
crossbeams (6) or sleepers extending transverse to the 

longitudinal direction of the rails are slidingly supported on 
an element (10) of the supporting structure (2), or of the 

foundation (5), in the region of the dilatation gap remaining 
between the supporting structure (2) and the foundation (5) so 

as to be displaceable in the longitudinal direction of the 
rails and that the rails are slidingly supported on the 

crossbeams (6) or sleepers. 
An arrangement for joining rails defined on a supporting 
structure according to claim 1, characterized in that the 

crossbeams (6) or sleepers are arranged equidistantly, and 
with a mean length of the gap, at a distance corresponding to 

the distance between sleepers on land. 
An arrangement for joining rails defined on a supporting 
structure according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 

the crossbeams (6) or sleepers are connected by means of a 
rope or chain pull, spring rods (7) or hydraulic cylinder 

piston aggregates so as to maintain equal distances between 
neighbouring beams (6) or sleepers at a change of the length 

(8) of the gap. 
An arrangement for joining rails defined on a supporting 
structure according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in that 

the foundation (5) or the supporting structure (2) in the 
region of the gap is laterally embraced by a cantilevering 

structural element respectively connected with the supporting 
structure (2) or the foundation (5) and that the crossbeams  

 
(6) or sleepers are slidingly mounted in the laterally 

embracing structural elements. 
An arrangement for joining rails defined on a supporting 

structure according to claim 4, characterized in that slide 
bearings are arranged between laterally embracing structural 

elements (9) and the embraced structural element (10). 
An arrangement for joining rails defined on a supporting 
structure according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 

in that a flexionally elastic connecting member separated from 
the dilatation means (3) is provided for absorbing torsional 

loads.
