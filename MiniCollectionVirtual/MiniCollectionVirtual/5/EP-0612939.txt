<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (100) for engaging a hydraulic clutch 
(102) has a varying control volume in response to an engage 

signal. The apparatus comprises a solenoid (106) with an 
armature (204) and a coil (202), and a control valve having 

a spool and being connected between a source of pressurized 
hydraulic fluid and the clutch. The spool is connected to 

the armature and is movable between a no-flow position and 
a full flow position in response to the movement of the 

armature. Control means is provided for controlling the 
spool via the armature in response to a voltage condition 

of the coil and an end-of-fill signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to an apparatus and 
method for detecting an end-of-fill condition for a 
hydraulic actuator and more particularly, to an apparatus 
and method for detecting an EMF signal in a solenoid caused 
by the end-of-fill condition and therby controlling the 
engagement of a clutch. Electronic control systems are particularly well 
suited for applications in which operating conditions or 
parameters change. Electronic transmission controllers, 
for example, are becoming more prevalent because of their 
suitability for handling the complex tasks required for the 
shifting of a transmission between gear ratios. Usually, electronic solenoids are used for the 
engagement/disengagement of the transmission's clutches. 
The engagement of a hydraulic clutch consists of two 
stages: the fill mode and the pressure modulation mode. In 
the fill mode, the clutch volume is filled with hydraulic 
fluid. In the pressure modulation mode, the pressure 
within the clutch volume is modulated (increased) to a 
pressure level to ensure proper and full engagement of the 
clutch. To actuate the clutch, the solenoid is therefore, 
first energized to begin filling the clutch. When the 
clutch is filled, the current applied to the solenoid is 
modulated (typically, in an increasing linear ramp 
function) to continue the flow of hydraulic fluid tothe 
clutch and, thereby, increase the pressure to a level 
sufficient to properly engage the clutch. Typically, a timing strategy has been used to 
determine when the clutch has reached the end of fill 
condition. In this situation, the solenoid's coil would be 
energized and the clutch would begin to fill with hydraulic 
fluid. After a predetermined time period, the transmission 
controller would begin to modulate current, in an effort to 
fully engage the clutch.  This procedure has several limitations. For example, 
operating conditions change the actual time required to 
fill the clutch. Since pump flow is a function of engine 
speed, pump flow will vary with engine speed. Other 
factors (for example, other hydraulic systems being 
supplied by the pump) may also affect pump flow. As the 
pump flow varies, the time required to fill the clutch will 
also vary. Other operating conditions which affect the 
clutch fill times are present gear ratio, desired gear 
ratio, transmission load, and inclination of the vehicle. Variations in the engine and operating characteristics 
of the transmission components can be expected over the 
life of the vehicle due to wear.
