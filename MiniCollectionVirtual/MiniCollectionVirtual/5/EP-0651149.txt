<ABSTRACT>
In a device for controlling the amount of injected fuel in internal combustion engines depending on the air flow into the cylinders, the said device having a cylinder air flow determination unit, the cylinder air flow determination unit is connected to a signal line of a variable camshaft adjustment system for the transmission of a measured value proportional to a camshaft adjustment, and the cylinder air flow determination unit contains a plurality of characteristic maps, each of which can be selected as a function of a correction parameter formed from this measured value.

<CLAIMS>
A device in a motor vehicle with an internal combustion engine
for the control of the fuel injection quantity as a function of air

flow into the cylinders of the internal combustion engine, with
a cylinder air flow determination unit (9) which is connected to

a signal line of a variable camshaft adjustment system for
transmission of a measured value (w
e
; w
a
) proportional to a
camshaft adjustment, and containing a plurality of

characteristics maps (1, 2, 3, 4) which can each be selected
on the basis of a correction parameter (Ü1, Ü2, Ü3, Ü4)

formed from this measured value (w
e
; w
a
), 
characterised in that

the camshaft adjustment system adjusts the intake and
exhaust camshafts, a measured value (w
e
; w
a
) proportional to
the camshaft adjustment is transmitted for each of the two

camshafts, these measured values (w
e
; w
a
) are added together
and that the correction parameter (Ü1, Ü2, Ü3, U4) for

selection of the characteristics maps (1, 2, 3, 4) is the result
of this addition (w
e
 + w
a
).
A device according to patent claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
operating parameters of the internal combustion engine in the

characteristics maps (1, 2, 3, 4) to establish the air flow (
m
Z
)
into the cylinder are the internal combustion engine speed (n)

and the intake pressure (p).
