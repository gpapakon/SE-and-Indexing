<ABSTRACT>
The printed product (16) is introduced from above into the shaft (52) and between the fingers (56) and is positioned in such a way that it is arranged approximately symmetrically relative to the axis of rotation (54') of the fingers (56). When the fingers rotate in the direction of the arrow, the printed product is folded in a S-shaped manner by cooperation with elastic belts (114,116) and is thus brought into a tubular shape. A foil-like holding element (34) is also wound on, in order to wrap the printed product (16) and keep it in the tubular shape.

A device for manufacturing portable tubular packages (20) 
out of at least one printed product (16) each, in particular a 

newspaper or magazine, and with a holding element (34) holding 
the printed product together, with two fingers (56) whose longitudinal 

axes (56') are parallel to an axis of rotation (54') 
extending between them and which, together with the said axis of 

rotation are arranged approximately in an axial plane (58), 
between which the printed product (16) to be processed can be 

introduced substantially in an insertion plane (142) extending 
transversely to the axial plane (58), a cooperating element (112) 

arranged outside the fingers (56) relative to the axis of rotation 
(54'), which element is intended, after the printed product 

(16) has been introduced, to delimit together with the finger 
(56) moving past at the time, a gap through which the printed 

product (16) passes as the fingers (56) and the cooperating 
element (112) rotate relative to one another round the axis of 

rotation (54'), and thus to bend the printed product (16) round 
the fingers (56) and to bring it into its tubular shape, and 

means (18) for feeding and attaching the holding element (34) 
holding the printed product (16) together in its tubular shape, 

characterized by a conveyor device (14) which is intended to 
introduce the printed product (16) between the fingers (56), 

means for positioning the printed product (16) approximately 
symmetrically to the axis of rotation (54'), and two cooperating 

elements (112) lying approximately opposite one another relative 
to the axis of rotation (54') which each form with one of the 

fingers (56') a gap, so as to bend the part of the printed 

product (16) arranged on one side of the axial plane (58) round 
one finger (56), and the other part round the other finger (56''), 

in which arrangement the fingers (56) are arranged in a well (52) 
the well walls whereof form the cooperating elements (112) which 

cooperate with the fingers (56) and which are formed by belts 
(114, 116) tensioned in an elastic or yielding mode and run at 

right angles to the axis of rotation (54'), which as viewed in a 
direction at right angles to the axis of rotation (54') are  

 
carried at both ends of the well (52) round guide rollers (118, 

118'), and the guide rollers (118) arranged at the outlet side of 
the well (52) can be moved away from one another for guiding the 

package (20) out of the well (52). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
conveyance direction (F) of the conveyor device (14) for introducing 

the printed product (16) between the fingers (56) extends 
at right angles to the axis of rotation (54'). 
A device according to claim 2, characterized by two coaxial 
finger pairs (50) interspaced in the direction of the axis of 

rotation (54'), between which the printed product (16) can be 
introduced and which can be moved away from one another in the 

axial direction for their separation from the printed product 
(16) brought into its tubular shape. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the axis of rotation (54') extends in a horizontal direction 

and that the conveyor device (14) is designed so as to introduce 
the printed products (16) between the fingers (56) from the top. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that for guiding the package (20) out of the well (52), the guide 

rollers (118) arranged at the outlet side of the well (52) are 
interspaced from one another, at least to the extent that the 

printed product can be loosely carried through between them. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in 
that the conveyor device (14) has a conveyor belt (116) carried 

at both well ends round guide rollers (118, 118') and driven in 
circulation in the conveyance direction (F), which belt cooperates 

at the inlet side of the well (52) with a preferably 
cylinder-type pressing-on element (138), so as to form together 

therewith a conveyance gap for the printed product (16).  
 
A device according to claim 6, characterized in that for 
introducing the leading edge (146) of the printed product (16) 

between the conveyor belt (116) and the pressing-on element 
(138), these can be moved away from one another. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that the holding element (34) is a section of a sheet web (160) 

made of a plastic material, and the means (18) for feeding the 
holding element (34) have a delivery device leading into the 

conveyance path of the printed product (16), which delivery 
device gives the start of the holding element (34) along with the 

trailing half of the printed product (16) at approximately 
the conveyance speed (v
1
) of the conveyor device (14). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterized by 
a conveyor device (14) for feeding the printed product (16) to 

the well (52), and a delivery device (18) for the holding element (34) formed

(16), with a 

mounting arrangement for the stock roll (172), a conveyor roller 
(164) for the sheet web (160), driven in a start/stop mode, means 

(184) arranged between the mounting arrangement and the conveyor 
roller (164) for tensioning the sheet web (160), and a separating 

device (200) disposed down the line from the conveyor roller 
(164) for separating the holding element (34) from the sheet web 

(160), in which arrangement a further conveyor roller (178) for

and the conveyor roller (164), the sheet web (160) is deflected 
between these conveyor rollers (164, 178) as well as between the 

additional conveyor roller (178) and the mounting arrangement 
round prestressed rollers (176, 178) so as to form stock loops, 

and the additional conveyor roller (178) is driven in dependence of
