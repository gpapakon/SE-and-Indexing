<ABSTRACT>
The interface device (10) serves to connect a data terminal (14) to a telecommunications network (11). It comprises the base unit (19) and the handset (20) of a cordless telephone, a mechanical bracket (23) and an optical interface (25). This interface is divided into two independent halves which are disposed in the handset (20) or in a mechanical bracket (27) of an adapter unit (23). The bracket (27), the handset (20) and the interface halves are matched to one another in such a way that they can be brought into close mechanical or optical contact. If a contact of this type is established, a data link can then be set up and maintained between the aforementioned terminal (14) and any other terminal (15) via the interface (25) and the network (11).
