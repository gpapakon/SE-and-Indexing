<ABSTRACT>
A short-channel MOS transistor contains doped regions (13, 16, 17) for source, channel and drain regions which are arranged in a vertical direction in a silicon substrate (11), with the source region arranged on the surface of the substrate. At least the source and channel regions are laterally bounded by insulation regions (14). Below the drain region (13), a buried layer (12) with corresponding doping is provided, on which a deeply extending connection region (15) extends laterally from the source, channel and drain regions. A gate dielectric (19) and gate electrode (110) are arranged on the surface of a trench (18) which runs essentially perpendicularly to the surface of the substrate (11) and reaches down as far as the drain region (13). The length of the channel is, in particular, equal to from 50 to 100 nm.
