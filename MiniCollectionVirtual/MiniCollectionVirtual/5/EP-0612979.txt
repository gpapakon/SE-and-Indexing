<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device of the kind 
described in the preamble of Claim 1. Optoelectrical position sensors may include an encoding 
disc having provided thereon some form of pattern 
which can be read optically. The disc pattern is read 
by one or more detectors which produce an electric 
signal relating to rotation or part rotation of the 
encoding disc. The encoding disc either comprises an absolute encoding 
disc or an incremental encoding disc. An absolute 
encoding disc is provided with a pattern which is 
unique for each angular unit of rotation. Thus, when 
reading an absolute encoding disc, it is possible to 
establish the absolute angular positions of the disc. 
On the other hand, an incremental encoding disc is 
provided with a periodic pattern, for instance a 
pattern comprised of many light and dark fields of 
mutually equal size. When the incremental encoding 
disc is rotated or partially rotated, it is possible 
to detect the change between dark and light fields and 
therewith to read angular changes between the position 
of the disc. There is often a need to read angles with a given 
resolution within only a certain determined angular 
sector. According to known techniques, this need is 
satisfied by arranging a mechanical gear unit comprising 
gearwheels or like devices between a first axle 
whose position is to be measured and the axle on which 
the encoding disc is mounted. The gear unit functions 
to rotate the encoding disc through one full revolution  
 
when the first axle is rotated through an angle 
corresponding to the specific angular sector. When 
wishing to change the resolution of the angle measuring 
signal, it is necessary, when applying known 
techniques, to exchange the encoding disc for another 
encoding disc which has another resolution in the 
encoding disc pattern, or to replace the mechanical 
gear unit. Changes of measuring angle sector are thus highly 
complicated when applying known techniques and require 
gearwheels to be fitted to and/or removed from a 
mechanical gear unit. The work involved in changing 
the resolution of the angle sensor is also complicated 
and requires mechanical replacement of an encoding 
disc. The main object of the present invention to provide a 
sensor unit which will enable the resolution in the 
angle output signal of the sensor unit to be readily 
adjusted. Another object of the present invention is to provide 
a sensor unit whose output signal includes a predetermined 
number of digital bits in combination with
