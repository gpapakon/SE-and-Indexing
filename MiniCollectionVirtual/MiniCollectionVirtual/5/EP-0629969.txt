<ABSTRACT>
An artificial neuron, which may be implemented either in 
hardware or software, has only one significant processing element 

in the form of a multiplier (22, FIG. 4). Inputs are first fed 
through gating functions to produce gated inputs. These gated 

inputs are then multiplied together to produce a product which is 
multiplied by a weight to produce the neuron output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to the following invention 
which is assigned to the same assignee as the present invention: "Neural Network and Method of Using Same", having U.S. 
Patent Application Serial No. 08/076,601, filed concurrently 
herewith. The subject matter of the above-identified related invention 
is hereby incorporated by reference into the disclosure of this 
invention. This invention relates generally to artificial neurons and, in 
particular, to an artificial neuron that can take the form of (1) a 
neuron circuit which can be employed as the building block of a 
neural network that can be implemented in a VLSI (very large 
scale integration) chip or of (2) a computer program, and which 
artificial neuron utilizes a training algorithm that does not 
require repetitive training and that yields a global minimum to 
each given set of input vectors. Artificial neural networks have utility in a wide variety of 
computing environments, such as speech recognition, process 
control, optical character recognition, signal processing, and 
image processing. Processing engines for many of the foregoing 
computing environments may be implemented through neural 
networks comprising a plurality of elemental logic elements 
called neuron circuits.  A neuron circuit (or processing element) is the fundamental 
building block of a neural network. A neuron circuit has multiple 
inputs and one output. The structure of a conventional neuron 
circuit often includes a multiplier circuit, a summing circuit, a 
circuit for performing a non-linear function (such as a binary 
threshold or sigmoid function), and circuitry functioning as 
synapses or weighted input connections. Refer to FIG. 1, wherein 
inputs x₁-xn are weighted by respective synapses w₁-wn and 
accumulated together by summing circuit 2. The output of 
summing circuit 2 is fed into non-linear circuit 4 to generate the 
neuron circuit output 5. FIG. 2 shows a non-linear transfer function in the form of a 
sigmoid-shaped function which is used by the prior art neuron 
circuit shown in FIG. 1. In the example shown, the sigmoid curve 6 
is expressed by the equation: 
OUTPUT = 1/(1+e-NET) FIG. 3 shows another prior art neuron circuit, referred to as 
a perceptron neuron, which employs a binary threshold function. 
In this example, the perceptron neuron uses a binary threshold 14 
as the non-linear function. In summary, a typical conventional neuron circuit requires 
circuitry for weighted input connections, a summing circuit, a 
multiplier circuit,
