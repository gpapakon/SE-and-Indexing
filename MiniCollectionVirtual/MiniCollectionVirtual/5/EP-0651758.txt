 "PHOSPHITE-BORANE COMPOUNDS, AND METHOD OF MAKING THESAME"DESCRIPTIONField of the InventionThe present invention relates to phosphite-borane derivatives with nucleoside substituents that exhibit antineoplastic, anti-hyperlipidemic, and anti-inflammatory activity.Description of the Related ArtA. Lewis base-borane Compounds:Various boron-containing compounds have previously been shown to exhibit therapeutic biological activity. For example, amine-borane compounds such as amine-B H 2COOH, amine-B H2COOMe and amine-BH2CONHR have been demonstrated to exhibit antitumor, anti- inflammatory and hypolipidemic activities. Additionally, phosphite-borane compounds have been used in hydroboration under mild conditions (Pelter, A., et al/ /. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1981, 1014). Since the first reports of phosphite-borane compounds and their properties (Reetz, T., /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1960, 82, 5039), very few phosphite-borane compounds have been synthesized and/or had their properties investigated (Das, M.K., et a Synth. React. Inorg. Met. Org. Chem. 1986, 16, 67; Martin, D.R. et al; Pennington, B.T., /. Inorg. Nucl. Chem. 1978, 40, 9; and Mutterties, E.L., "The Chemistry of Boron and its Compounds," Wiley, New York, 1967).Generally, phosphite-borane derivatives may be considered as analogs of alkylphosphates, (RO)3P=0 vs.. (RO)3PBH3, as well as analogs of alkylphosphonates, e.g., (RO)2P(0)CH3 vs. (RO)2P(0)BH3, or (RO)2P(0)CH2X vs. (RO)2P(0)BH2X, wherein R is alkyl and X is heteroatom substituent. Since phosphate and phosphonate groups are present in a variety of biologically 

important molecules, e.g., DNA, RNA, phospholipids, aminophosphonates, etc., their boron-containing analogs may prove useful as biomolecular probes and as potential therapeutic agents.Additionally, several synthetic phosphonates, e.g., phosphonoacetic acid, phosphonoformic acid, etc., have been found to possess significant antiviral activity (Mayer, R.F., e_t _ύ, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1976, 9, 308; Oberg, B., Pharmac. Ther., 1983, 19, 387; and Clerq, E.D., /. Med. Chem. 1986, 29, 1561). This antiviral activity coupled with the established pharmacological activity of amine-borane derivatives makes phosphite- borane derivatives potentially significant as a class of bioactive compounds.B. Modified NucleotidesRibo- and deoxyribonucleoside 5'-mono-, di-, and triphosphates play a central role in the metabolism of nucleic acids, one of the most important polymer molecules of living systems. It has long been realized that chemically modified
