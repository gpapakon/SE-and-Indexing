<ABSTRACT>
The container casing (W) for containing recording media, such as tape-shaped or 
disc-shaped recording media, has an underlying layer (110, 111), a colored layer 

(112) and a protective layer (113). The underlying layer is formed by printing on 
the outer surface of the main casing member. The colored layer (112) is formed on 

the underlying layer by color printing based on the picture information. The 
protective layer (113) is formed on the colored layer for protecting the colored 

layer. The protective layer has an opening (113a) for exposing its partial portion to 
outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a casing for housing a
recording medium and a printing method for printing thereon. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a casing for housing
the recording medium bearing a printing on its outer surface and
a method for making a printing on the outer surface of the casing.On a casing for housing a recording medium, such as a disc
cartridge containing an optical disc or a magneto-optical disc, or
a tape cassette containing a magnetic tape, printing is made of a
so-called logo-mark for asserting that the product belongs to a
certain and certain company, or various designs for enhancing the
commercial value of the product. Such printing on the casing for
the recording medium is usually performed in the following manner.First, a manuscript having the design drawn thereon for
printing on the casing is color-separated by a color CCD scanner.
Positive color films associated with the separated colors and then 
the master plates for the respective colors are
prepared. After calibration, test printing is made on
a cassette and adjustment is made of ink viscosity.
Then, after registration of the color master plates,
printing is made on the casing for housing the
recording medium.Meanwhile, the picture pattern printed on the
outer surface of the casing for the recording medium is
supplied from the manufacturer, while there is no room
for an ultimate user or an intermediate user to make
his or her original designing.Thus the casing cannot be adapted to cope with
the demand raised by the ultimate user or the
intermediate user for printing desired pictures or
designs for presentation or publicity, so that the
application of the casing for the recording medium
cannot be enlarged as desired. Besides, the paper
index or paper label as used heretofore is not
satisfactory for presentation or publicity in view of
permanent storage and product quality. On the other
hand, there lacks up to now a container casing for a
recording medium in which a picture pattern such as a
logo-mark (ornamental design letter) for asserting that
the product belongs to a certain and certain company or
a variety of designs intended for raising the
commercial value of the product or showing features of
the recording contents recorded on the recording
medium, and an index for adding the title, logo or
characters for event holding by the intermediate user,
are combined into one printing pattern.EP-A-0 383 330 describes the provision of a
decorative design on a magnetic disk cartridge by means
of a label

<CLAIMS>
A container casing (W; 29) for recording media
having a main casing member having the recording media

housed therein, characterised by comprising

a highly adhesive layer (110) formed on the outer
surface of said main casing member,
an ink receptive layer (111) provided on said
highly adhesive layer,
a colored layer (112) formed on said ink
receptive layer (111), and
a protective layer (113) formed on said colored
layer for protecting the colored layer, said protective

layer having an opening (113a) for exposing to the
outside a part of said colored layer on which writing

may be made.
The container casing (W; 29) for recording media

as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the ink
receptive layer (111) is a white ink receptive layer.
The container casing for recording media as
claimed in claim 1, wherein said colored layer (112)

and said protective layer (113) are formed by printing.
A method for printing a container casing (W; 29)
for recording media having a main casing member having

the recording media housed therein, comprising the
steps of


forming a highly adhesive layer (110) on the
outer surface of said main casing member,
providing an ink receptive layer (111) on said
highly adhesive layer (110),
forming a colored layer (112) on said ink
receptive layer (111), and
selectively forming a protective layer (113) on
the surface of said colored layer, excluding a portion

thereof, so as to expose to the outside a part of said
colored layer on which writing may be made.
The method for printing a container casing (W;
29) for recording media according to claim 4, wherein

said colored layer (112) and said protective layer
(113) are formed by printing;
A method for printing a container casing (W; 29)
for recording media according to claim 4 or 5, and

comprising the steps of

reading picture information for printing said
main casing member,
forming an underlying layer (110, 111) on the
outer surface of said casing main member by printing,
forming the colored layer (112) on said
underlying layer by printing, based on the read picture

information, and
forming the protective layer (113) on the entire
surface of said colored layer based on the read picture

information so that an opening (113a), constituting
said excluded portion, is formed in the protective

layer, exposing a part of said colored layer.
