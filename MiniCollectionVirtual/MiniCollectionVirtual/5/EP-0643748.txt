<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to marking
compositions.Traditionally, marking compositions,
e.g., highlighting inks, writing inks, and
correction fluids, have been provided in liquid
form, as solvent-based or aqueous solutions.
These solutions suffer from various
disadvantages, including drying too slowly or
too quickly and settling of suspended pigments.
There also are environmental and/or safety
concerns caused by solvent use.Additionally, the use of a liquid
marking composition requires that the
composition be supplied in a marking pen or
other dispenser. Typically pens and other ink
dispensers are disposable, creating waste when
the ink supply is exhausted.Certain marking compositions (see,
e.g., U.S. Patent No. 2,380,126), and correction
compositions (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No.
4,992,502) have been provided as solid wax
crayons. U.S. Patent 4,721,739 discloses an erasable ink
composition comprising a pigment, a solvent and a
block copolymer dissolved in said solvent.The invention features erasable
marking compositions, in solid form, which can
be applied to paper substrates to provide an
erasable marking. One aspect of the invention features a
solid erasable marking composition that includes
a block copolymer, a wax, and a colorant, e.g.,
a pigment or oil-soluble dye. The composition
is provided in solid form and forms an erasable
marking when applied to a substrate.Another aspect of the invention
features an erasable highlighting composition
including a block copolymer, a wax, and a
fluorescent pigment. The composition is in
solid form, and, when applied to an underlying
marking on a substrate, is capable of forming a
highlighting marking which may be erased without
lifting the underlying marking.Preferred block copolymers are
styrene-ethylene/butylene-styrene (S-EB-S) block
copolymers and styrene-isoprene-styrene (S-I-S)
block copolymers, with S-EB-S copolymers being
more preferred. It is preferred that the
copolymer have a melting temperature of less
than about 180°C. Preferably the composition
contains from approximately 2 to 20, and more
preferably 6 to 16 weight percent of the block
copolymer.Preferred waxes include
microcrystalline waxes, beeswax, carnauba wax,
cetyl esters wax, cocoa butter and mixtures
thereof. Mixtures of waxes are typically
preferred, as more balanced properties, e.g.
hardness, spreadability, and adhesion, can be
obtained from a blend of waxes than from any
single wax.In some preferred embodiments, the
marking composition further includes an oil,
such as linseed oil, mineral
