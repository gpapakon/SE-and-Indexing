<ABSTRACT>
A coaxial connector comprising at least one outermost (48) 
and one innermost contact socket or pin (49), mutually electrically 

insulated and surrounded by a housing, and having connecting portions 
of electrically conducting material for connecting the 

coaxial connector to a printed circuit board (2), the outermost 
contact socket (48) being electrically connected to an outer connecting 

portion (50) for connecting it to said printed circuit 
board and the innermo
st contact socket or pin (49) having an inner 
connecting portion (51) for connecting it to said printed circuit 

board, said outer connecting portion (48) and said inner connecting 
portion (49) being arranged to contact opposite sides of said 

printed circuit board by a surface mounting technique, said outer 
connecting portion (50) being integrally made with said outermost 

contact socket (48) and said inner connecting portion (51) being 
integrally made with said innermost contact socket or pin (49).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coaxial connector comprising at
least one outermost and one innermost contact socket or pin, mutually
electrically insulated and surrounded by a housing, and having
connecting portions of electrically conducting material for connecting
the coaxial connector to a printed circuit board, the
outermost contact socket being electrically connected to an outer
connecting portion for connecting it to said printed circuit board
and the innermost contact socket or pin having an inner connecting
portion for connecting it to said printed circuit board.Such a coaxial connector is known from the German patent
application 3.620.111, which comprises an additional contact case
inserted into the outermost contact socket in order to establish
good electrical and mechanical contact. The additional contact case
is provided with two contact strips extending from the case and
suitable to be soldered to contact pads on a predetermined side or
a printed circuit board. The innermost contact socket is provided
with an inner contact strip extending beyond the case and suitable
to be soldered to the same predetermined side of the printed circuit
board.United States patent 3.958.852 describes a connector having
one side that can be connected to several coaxial plugs of coaxial
cables and one side that can be connected to a printed circuit
board or the like. This connector therefore serves as an intermediate
between coaxial cables and a printed circuit board or the like.
The side of the connector to be connected to the circuit board or
the like is provided with an inner conductor and an outer conductor
between which the printed circuit board can be inserted, both the
inner and the outer conductor being arranged to establish good
electrical and mechanical contact with predetermined contact pads
on the printed circuit board.United States patent 3.689.865 discloses a connector having a
first side connected to several coaxial cables and a second side
into which a printed circuit board or the like can inserted. The
connector comprises a plurality of inner contact members being
soldered to respective inner conductors of the coaxial cables and
to respective metallic pads on a small internal printed circuit 
board. The inner contact members are arranged to establish electrical
contact to contact pads on a predetermined side of the printed
circuit board or the like. One outer contact member is provided to
establish good electrical contact to a ground plane on the opposite
side of the printed circuit board or the
