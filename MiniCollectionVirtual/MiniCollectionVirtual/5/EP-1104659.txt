<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reclining apparatus for
reclining a seat back of a seat relative to a seat member (or "seat
cushion"). More specifically, the present invention relates to the
reclining apparatus having a base member secured to the seat
member, a rotary arm rotatably supported on the base member and
secured to the seat back, a lock member put between the base
member and the rotary arm, and having an external toothed portion
formed at its end, and a rotatable cam for moving the lock member
between a lock position in which the external toothed portion of the
lock member meshes with an internal toothed portion of the rotary
arm and an unlock position in which the external toothed portion of
the lock member is spaced apart from the internal toothed portion of
the rotary arm.Each of Japanese Patent Unexamined Publications No.
9(1997)-028496 and No. 9(1997)-131237 is the one that was
invented previously by the inventor (applicant) of the present
invention, and discloses a reclining apparatus similar to that of the
present invention. Japanese Patent Examined Publication No.
63(1988)-065327 discloses a backrest hinge apparatus capable of
locking according to an adjusting position. Moreover, Japanese
Patent Unexamined Publication No. 7(1995)-136032 discloses a
construction in which a cam is movable only in sliding directions
(upward and downward) of a pole, to thereby prevent a bad joining
due to dimensional errors of the pole and the cam.In addition to the four prior arts described above, there is
disclosed a related art in Figs. 6 to 9. The related art has a base
member 1 and a rotary arm 2 which are formed through a press
molding process. The base member 1 is secured to the seat member
with six fasteners B1. The rotary arm 2 is rotatably supported on the
base member 1 and is secured to the seat back with six fasteners B2. 
The base member 1 is formed with a recess 10 having a pair of first
and second guide walls 9a and 9b. On the other hand, as is best seen
in Fig. 6, the rotary arm 2 is formed with a cylindrical recess 19.A pair of first and second lock members 12A and 12B are put
between the recess 10 of the base member 1 and the cylindrical
recess 19 of the rotary arm 2. The first and second lock members 12A
and 12B are disposed in the recess 10 of the base member 1, and are
guided by the pair of the first and second guide walls 9a and 9b of the
base member 1 in such a manner as to freely move in upward and
downward directions in Figs. 6 and 7. Each of the first and second
lock members
