<ABSTRACT>
An I/O transceiver circuit, suitable for use on 
each integrated circuit of a multi-chip module, 

controls the output resistance of the transmitter 
portion (20). Control of the output resistance is 

achieved by a phase-locked-loop arrangement which 
includes a phase detector (102) a charge pump (106), a 

low-pass filter (108), a voltage controller (110) and a 
voltage controlled oscillator (120). Control of the 

output resistance allows operation without 
characteristically terminated I/O lines between multi-chip 

modules, thereby saving power otherwise wasted in 
the terminating resistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transceiver circuits suitable for use on integrated circuits. As conventional integrated circuits become denser, i.e. more active devices per 
square centimetre, and faster, the required heat dissipation per square centimetre becomes 
greater and greater. This would be less of a problem if it meant that integrated circuits 
would be spaced further apart in order to dissipate this heat, but the direction of current 
integrated circuit technology is to space the integrated circuit chips closer and closer 
together. By spacing the integrated circuit chips as closely as possible, capacitive and 
inductive loading of output lead lines and the problems of driving output lead lines are 
reduced. Previous designs accepted the high heat densities of conventional integrated 
circuit logic connected in multi-chip modules and expended large amounts of energy and 
special purpose equipment, such as large heat sinks and liquid or cryogenic cooling, to cool 
the multi-chip modules. Expending substantial amounts of money on cooling multi-chip 
modules could be eliminated and energy saved if the logic on the multi-chip modules 
simply dissipated less heat to start with. JP-A-0,2246624 discloses an output buffer circuit in which the output impedance 
can be adjusted in an attempt to achieve a more constant value for both high and low 
output signals. However, the manner in which the output impedance of the buffer circuit 
of this document can be adjusted is disadvantageously limited. It is an object of the present invention to provide a digital integrated circuit that has 
a low power consumption. Therefore, according to the present invention, there is provided a transceiver 
circuit for an integrated circuit having a pad located therein, a receiving circuit connected 
to the pad for receiving digital data signals therefrom, a transmitting circuit connected to 
the pad for transmitting digital data signals to the pad, characterized by output resistance 
control means connected to said transmitting circuit and arranged to dynamically retain 
said output resistance of the transmitting circuit at a constant value during data signal 
transmission from said transmitting circuit.  
 It will be appreciated that a transceiver circuit 
according to the invention has the advantage of low 
power consumption and consequently low heat generation, 
since the output resistance control arrangement enables 
the elimination of termination resistors to terminate 
integrated circuit I/O (input-output) lines.
