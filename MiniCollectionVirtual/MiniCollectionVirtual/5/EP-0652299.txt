<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an improved class of 
coatings suitable for operating in high temperature 
oxidizing environments in which said coatings comprise 
an alloy, such as NiCrAlYTa, or NiCrAlYPt preferably 
mixed with an oxide dispersion such as alumina or any 
combination thereof. There are many good oxidation and corrosion 
resistant coatings used in industry for various 
applications and for use in various environments. 
Articles composed of iron-, cobalt-, or nickel-based 
superalloys have been developed for use in 
applications, such as aerospace applications, and for 
use as blades, vanes, seals and other components 
utilized in gas turbine engines. In these 
applications, it is important that the articles have 
sufficient protection against undue oxidation and 
sulphidation since such corrosion can affect the useful 
life of the article resulting in reduced performance 
and possible safety problems. Although various 
superalloys have a high degree of corrosion resistance 
such resistance decreases when the superalloys are 
operated in or exposed to high temperature 
environments. To increase the useful life of components made of 
alloys and superalloys, various coatings have been 
developed. Aluminide coatings were initially used to 
provide a corrosion resistant outer layer but such 
layer was observed to crack when subjected to  
 
mechanically or thermally induced strain. Another 
class of coatings developed was the MCrAlY overlay 
coatings where M represents a transition metal element 
such as iron, cobalt or nickel. The coatings have been 
found to be more effective than the aluminide coatings 
in extending the useful life of alloy components in 
high temperature environments. Modern gas turbine engines operate in a high 
temperature environment in excess of 1093.3°C (2000°F) in 
which hot gases are expanded across rows of turbine blades. 
These turbine blades are typically nickel base alloys 
chosen for excellent high temperature creep and thermal 
fatigue resistance. In general, the design of the blade 
alloy sacrifices resistance to oxidation and hot corrosion 
in order to achieve the optimized mechanical properties. 
Therefore, the blade is coated with a thin layer of 
material designed to provide only high resistance to 
oxidation or hot corrosion, with little regard to 
mechanical properties of the coating. This thin coating, 
typically 76,2-203,2 µm (3 to 8 mils) thick, is generally applied by argon 
shrouded plasma spraying, plasma spraying in a vacuum 
chamber, or by physical
