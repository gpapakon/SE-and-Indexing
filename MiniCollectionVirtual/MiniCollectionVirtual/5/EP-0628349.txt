<ABSTRACT>
The crushing runners (7, 8) are in drive connection with a vertical king shaft (13) concentric to the grinding tracks (5, 6), which is driven via a gear (15) from an electric motor (19) arranged beneath the crushing bed (1). The gear is on the same axis as the electric motor and the king shaft. The electric motor is arranged in a suspended fashion. The gear is arranged tightly beneath the horizontal axes (9) of the crushing runners (5, 6), and is of the planetary type.

<CLAIMS>
An edge mill having a crushing bed (1) with a crushing track on which
revolve edge rolls (7, 8) which are connected in a driven manner to a

vertical king shaft (13), arranged concentrically with the crushing track,
which can be driven by an electric motor (19), arranged beneath the

crushing bed (1), by means of a gear drive (15) which is arranged on the
same axis as the electric motor (19) and the king shaft (13), wherein the

crushing bed (1) has a plurality of concentric crushing tracks (5, 6); and
the gear drive (15) is braced on the crushing bed (1) and in this fashion

is arranged just below the horizontal axes (9) of the edge rolls (5, 6).
The edge mill as defined in Claim 1, wherein the gear drive (15) is a
planetary gear drive.
