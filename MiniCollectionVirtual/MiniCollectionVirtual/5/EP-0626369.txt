<ABSTRACT>
A benzenesulfonamide derivative represented by general formula (I), which is useful for treating osteoporosis, or a pharmacologically 
acceptable salt thereof, wherein R¹ and R² may be the same or different from each other and each represents 

hydrogen or lower alkanoyl; and R³ and R⁴ may be the same or different from each other and each represents hydrogen, 
lower alkyl, alicyclic alkyl, (un)substituted polycyclic alkyl, substituted aryl or (un)substituted heterocycle, or alternatively 

R³ and R⁴ are combined together with the adjacent nitrogen atom to represent (un)substituted alicyclic heterocycle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to benzenesulfonamide 
derivatives which are useful as therapeutic 
agents for osteoporosis. J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 112, 7861 (1990) discloses 
compounds represented by Formula (A) 
 
wherein Rc represents sulfonanilide. Further, EP 395093 
discloses that compounds represented by Formula (A) wherein 
Rc represents carbamoyl etc. are useful as therapeutic 
agents for osteoporosis. According to the present invention, there can be 
provided benzenesulfonamide derivatives represented by 
Formula (I): 
 
 
in which R1 and R2 independently represent hydrogen or C1-C5 
alkanoyl; and R3 and R4 independently represent hydrogen, 
C1-C8 alkyl, cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted 
polycycloalkyl, substituted aryl, or a substituted or 
unsubstituted heterocyclic group, or R3 and R4 are combined 
together with the adjacent nitrogen atom to form a 
substituted or unsubstituted aliphatic heterocyclic group 
[hereinafter referred to as Compound (I); the same applies 
to the compounds of other formula numbers], or 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In the definitions of the groups in Formula (I), 
the C1-C8 alkyl means a straight-chain or branched alkyl 
group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, 
propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, 
pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, and octyl. The C1-C5 
alkanoyl means a straight-chain or branched alkanoyl group 
having 1 to 5 carbon atoms such as formyl, acetyl, 
propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, valeryl, and pivaloyl. The 
cycloalkyl means a cycloalkyl group having 3 to 8 carbon 
atoms such as cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 
cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl. The polycycloalkyl means a 
saturated hydrocarbon group having (a) bridge(s) which is 
selected from the group consisting of compounds represented 
by the formula 
 
(in which Q1 represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; m 
represents 0 or 1; and n represents an integer of 0 to 5) 
such as tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decyl and tricyclo[3.3.1.03,7]nonyl, 
and compounds represented by the formula   
(in which n has the same meaning as defined above) such as 
bicyclo[2.2.1]heptyl. The C1-C8 alkyl in the definition of 
Q1 has the same meaning as the above-defined C1-C8 alkyl. The aryl means phenyl or naphthyl. The 
substituted aryl has 1 to 3 independently-selected 
substituents. The substituent includes, for example, C1-C8 
alkyl, hydroxy, C1-C8 alkoxy, C1-C8 alkylthio, halogen, 
nitro, amino, C1-C5 alkanoyl, aroyl, carboxy, and C1-C8 
alkoxycarbonyl. The alkyl moiety of
