<ABSTRACT>
A conductive polymer which is highly transparent to visible light in at least one of its conductive and non-conductive states is prepared by electrochemically polymerizing a monomer component comprising at least one monomer in an electrochemical cell having at least an anode and a cathode. The method comprises introducing into the cell a solution containing the monomer component and an electrolyte, maintaining the solution at a temperature within a range of from 0 to -40  DEG C inclusive, and repeatedly cycling an electrode potential applied to the cell between cathodic and anodic limits one of which (A) is fixed and the other of which (B) is set at a value at which anodic or cathodic polymerization takes place, thereby to effect the electrochemical polymerization. The method comprises the additional steps, prior to the polymerization, of i) repeatedly cycling an electrode potential applied to the cell between cathodic and anodic limits one of which (A) is fixed and the other of which (B) is set at a value having a magnitude below that at which anodic or cathodic polymerization may take place, ii) holding each of the limits (A) and (B) at their respective fixed and set values and simultaneously monitoring a trace of current/voltage until the trace becomes stable, and thereafter iii) progressively increasing the value of the limit (B) until the said value reaches a critical potential having a magnitude at which anodic or cathodic polymerization is initiated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the
preparation of polymers which are electronically
conductive, and with polymers obtained by that process.It is known that certain organic polymeric
materials may be conductive and further that certain such
polymers may be reversibly and repeatedly converted
between conductive and non-conductive states by the
application of a potential difference across a film of the
polymer. In general, available conducting polymers are
coloured materials, typically weakly coloured in the non-conducting
state and strongly coloured in the conducting
state or vice versa.It is known to prepare conducting polymers by
electrochemical polymerization. The polymerization of
pyrrole by such a process is described in the Encyclopedia
of Polymer Science and Engineering, Vol 13, Wiley -
Interscience, New York, 1988, pages 42-55. In such a
process, the monomer is dissolved in an appropriate
solvent in the presence of an electrolyte in an
electrolyte cell. Electrochemical polymerization is
carried out at room temperature and at a constant fixed
voltage to precipitate the polymer onto an anode.
However, under such conditions, coloured films tend to be
produced.In order to improve the strength, especially the
elongation at break of such films, it is known to prepare
a film by electrochemical polymerization of pyrrole
carried out at low temperatures between 0 and -40°C. Such
films are mechanically stretchable to provide a highly
oriented film with improved conductivity; see Ogarawara
et al, Mol. Cryst. Liq. Cryst. (1985), 118, 159-162.Conducting polymers are potentially suitable for
use in the form of a film applied to the windows of a 
building to control the flow of infra-red radiation,
especially heat energy, through the windows; see US-A-5099621.If the film is able to prevent such flow in one of
its states (for example in its conducting state) but to
allow the transmission of heat energy in its other state,
then loss of heat through the windows can be reduced or
prevented when required, by the application of the
necessary potential difference across the film. However
the strongly coloured available polymers are aesthetically
unsuitable for such a purpose.There is also a potential use for conductive films
in the field of infra-red photography, to generate images
on substrates which are sensitive to infra-red radiation
but insensitive to visual light. However films for this
purpose clearly must be transparent.There is therefore a need for a conducting
polymeric material which is transparent
