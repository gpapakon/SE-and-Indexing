<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a process for treating wood particles for use in flavoring aqueous 
liquids to mask undesirable taste components and to increase the extractability and 

reactivity of flavor enhancing components. Wood particles are contacted with a solution 
of aqueous ethanol, the solids separated and heated for at least fifteen minutes at 

temperatures up to 220°C. Also disclosed is a process for using such wood particles for 
treatment of aqueous liquids and aqueous liquids treated with such wood particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many of the world's potable beverages owe their character, complexity and
maturity to storage in wood containers. The products are largely, but not exclusively,
spirits of distilled ethanols. Ethanolic beverages have long been flavored by contacting the
ethanol containing liquid with wood and thereby extracting and reacting certain desirable
flavoring components from the wood by leaching into the liquid. Included in this category
are whiskies, including Scotch, Irish, bourbon, rye, Canadian, and Australian; and rum,
brandy, armagnac, cognac, eau de vie and other distilled beverage bases. Wine, though
not distilled, is also often matured in wood. In particular, most of the world's red wines,
dessert, or appetizer wines, and some of the white wines, derive their essential
characteristics from storage in wood containers. Under United States law certain ethanol
beverages are required to have certain minimum periods in contact with wood.Presently, maturation of these products is accomplished by placing the liquid in
wooden casks or barrels known as tight cooperage, where it remains for weeks, months or
years depending on the desired level of maturation. Of particular significance is the aging
of whiskies and brandies in which years of maturation in contact with wood are required.
The essential character of all these products is the result of the chemical changes that
occur from contact with and the chemical interaction of their ethanolic and water content
to their so-called congeners in the wood. No convenient, alternative technology of
maturation has been developed.Many woods contain flavor agents (congeners) essential and desired for beverage
maturation. An extensive listing of woods with favorable characteristics appears in "Some
Aspects of the Wooden Container as a Factor in Wine Maturation", chapter 12 of
Chemistry of Winemaking, Singleton, V.L. (1974) at 254-275.
All the woods cited may be used in the process disclosed hereinbelow.Several detriments are associated with current aging processes. The first of these
detriments is related to the cost and availability of the prime types and age and species of 
wood required to produce the best products. The scarcity, the removal of a natural
resource, and the high cost of prime grades of wood have caused producers to use inferior
grades of wood in many of their products with resulting lack of fullness and richness of
flavor in the ethanolic beverage.In addition to the cost of wood and labor for making barrels, there is the high
inventory cost during the

<CLAIMS>
A process of preparing a wood product useful for
flavouring distilled beverages, comprising


(i) comminuting raw, untreated wood into particles;
(ii) contacting the particles with an aqueous ethanol
solution containing from about 20% to about 95% ethanol at

a temperature of up to about 55°C;
(iii) separating the particles from the solution, and
(iv) heating the particles for at least about 15
minutes at a temperature of from about 100°C to about 220°C.
The process of claim 1 where the aqueous ethanol
solution contains from about 50% to about 80% ethanol.
The process of claim 1 or 2 where the duration of the
contacting step is in the range of from about 2 hours to

about 24 hours.
The process of any preceding claim which includes the
additional step, after the comminuting step and before the

contacting step, of heating the particles to a temperature
of from about 100°C to about 240°C for a period of at least

1 hour with a heat gradient not greater than 30°C/min.
The process of claim 4 which includes increasing the
temperature during the final portion of the additional step

for a period of from about 1 minute to about 30 
minutes.
The process of any one of the preceding claims wherein
the duration of the heating step (iv) is at least about 45

minutes.
A process according to any one of the preceding
claims, followed by the use of the wood product to flavour

an aqueous food product by contacting the aqueous food
product with the wood product for a period of time

sufficient to transfer flavour compounds from the wood
particles to the aqueous food product.
A process of claim 7 wherein the aqueous food product
is an ethanol-containing beverage.
A process of claim 7 or 8 wherein the aqueous food
product has an ethanol content of between about 55% and

about 85% ethanol.
A process of claim 7, 8 or 9 wherein the flavoured
product has the organoleptic qualities of an aged brandy or

an aged whisky.
