<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed at an electrically tunable filter for 
wavelength filtering of light. The filter comprises a substrate region (7), a 

waveguide region (1) over the substrate, an upper region (10) over the waveguide 
region, and current blocking regions (2) adjacent to the waveguide region. The 

waveguide region comprises a semiconductor (5) having a bandgap wavelength 
sufficiently different from the light for transparent transmission of the light. A 

waveguide rib layer (6) may also be included in the waveguide region to channel the 
light through the filter. The current blocking regions narrow the waveguide region to 

increase the current density. The present invention is also directed at a method of 
manufacturing the filter described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
A key component of Wavelength Division Multiplexed
(WDM) networks is a tunable broadband wavelength
demultiplexer. The ideal wavelength filter would be
widely tunable with constant transmittance over the entire
free spectral range, would be quickly tunable with narrow
channel spectrum selectivity (high finesse), and would be
integrable with other lightwave components such as
amplifiers or detectors. To that end, many different
devices have been developed as demultiplexers, such as a
piezoelectrically tunable fiber Fabry-Perot filter and a
laser diode operated below threshold.A piezoelectrically tunable Fabry-Perot fiber is
described in J. Stone and L. W. Stulz, "Pigtailed High-Finesse
Tunable Fibre Fabry-Perot Interferometers With
Large, Medium and Small Free Spectral Ranges," Elect.Lett., Vol. 23, pp. 781-783 (1987). This article
describes three Fabry-Perot filter prototypes and their
test results. All three designs used standard PZT
piezoelectric components for tuning. These filters
yielded finesse values up to 200. Furthermore, an
insertion loss as low as 1.5 dB was observed for lower
finesse values. Thus, mechanically adjusted filters have
excellent wavelength selectivity and low insertion loss.
Since they are mechanically tuned, however, they can only
attain tuning speeds in the order of milliseconds.
Therefore, a need exists for faster tuning filters. Semiconductor devices with inherently faster tuning
speed have been reported by a number of
groups. For example, T. Numai et al., "1.5 µm Tunable
Wavelength Filter with Wide Tuning Range and High Constant
Gain Using a Phase-controlled Distributed Feedback Laser
Diode," Appl. Phys. Lett., Vol. 53, No. 13 (Sept. 26,
1988), and Katsuaki Magari et al., "Optical Signal Selection with
a Constant Gain and a Gain Bandwidth by a Multielectrode
Distributed Feedback Laser Amplifier" Appl. Phys. Lett.,
Vol. 51, No. 24 (Dec. 14 1987) describe laser diodes with
wide tuning ranges and high tuning speed. However, laser
filters suffer from gain instability.Gain instability arises in laser diodes because they
absorb light at the wavelengths typically used in
multiplexing, e.g., 1.55µm. More specifically, the
valence electrons of the waveguide region semiconductor
absorb the multiplexed light waves and rise to an excited
state. Light is therefore absorbed rather than
transmitted by a laser diode.To overcome this problem and achieve a "transparent"
condition, current is applied across the laser diode.
This excites the electrons so that they cannot absorb the
light
