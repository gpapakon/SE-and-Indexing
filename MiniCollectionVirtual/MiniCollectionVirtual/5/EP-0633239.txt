<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides an improved method for recovering an organic acid as a salt 
from various process streams by addition of a crystallizing base to a concentrated 

solution of neutralized organic acid. The addition of such a base causes 
crystallization of the salt. This process provides more efficient recovery of organic 

acid salt from a fermentation process stream than traditional crystallization and it 
may be used essentially as a one step purification process. The improved method is 

particularly applicable to the recovery of trisodium or tripotassium citrate from 
process streams produced in the fermentation and recovery of citric acid, with the 

addition of a crystallizing base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, 
potassium hydroxide, or ammonia. The resulting product may be combined with an 

anticaking agent and/or dried to provide a particularly free flowing product.

<DESCRIPTION>
Organic acid sits, or the corresponding acids, are useful in the food, beverage,
flavors and perfumery industries. The salt may be the preferred form for
manufacture, with subsequent conversion to the acid as with organic acids
produced for flavors and perfumery. In fermentation, the acid is commonly the
fermentation product but the salt of such acid may be the desired end product.
For example, citric acid salts, particularly the sodium salt are suitable for use as
chelators, flavor enhancers and buffers in pharmaceutical, food and industrial
applications, where a higher pH is required than may be provided by citric acid.
Potassium citrate is used in pharmaceuticals and in food products. These salts
are typically prepared by neutralizing the organic acid solution with a base
containing the appropriate cation, e.g. potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide.Two principal acid recovery techniques which are used commercially at this time
in conjunction with the fermentation of citric acid and salts thereof are solvent
extraction as outlined in US Patent No. 4,275,234 to Baniel et al, and a lime-sulfuric
acid process. Additional modifications of these recovery processes have
been proposed in US Patent No. 4,994,609 to Baniel and Gonen and in EP 0
432 610 to Baniel and Eyal, respectively. EP 0 432 610 describes the concurrent
production of citric acid and alkali citrates by subjecting the mother liquor,
obtained from the crystallization of citric acid after the known lime-sulfuric
recovery process, to extraction with a water-immiscible organic extractant that
contains at least one organic amine and a liquid hydrocarbon. The resulting
extract is separated and neutralized with an aqueous alkali citrate whereby an 
alkali citrate brine is formed. The extractant is recycled and the aqueous alkali
citrate brine is processed for recovery of alkali citrate. The processing may
comprise cooling, addition of alkali, e.g. gaseous ammonia and a combination of
such operations. In the examples, ammonia is added to convert the monobasic
citrate in solution to the dibasic citrate. On cooling to 40 degrees C. in a
crystallizer, dibasic citrate crystallized out. If desired, in addition to or in lieu of
adding alkali in the course of the processing of the alkali citrate brine, it is
possible to add alkali during the neutralization operation. Baniel and Eyal
describe a procedure for preparation of aqueous solutions of alkali citrates from
which alkali citrates can be crystallized.In addition, the literature describes many other

An improved process for recovering an organic acid salt from an impure
process stream, comprising the steps of:


a) obtaining a solution of an organic acid salt of interest, concentrated to
within ten percent (by weight) of the saturation point;
b) adding a sufficient amount of a crystallizing base to the concentrated
solution of the organic acid salt to produce crystals of the salt; and
c) separating the crystallized organic acid salt from its mother liquor,

wherein steps a and b may be reversed, i.e., a crystallizing base may be added prior to
concentration of the solution.
A process according to claim 1 for the recovery of an organic acid salt from
a fermentation broth containing such organic acid and/or salt thereof,

comprising the steps of:

a) fermenting an appropriate carbon and hydrogen source as a substrate
in the presence of an appropriate microorganism to produce a

fermentation broth containing a desired organic acid and/or salt thereof
together with impurities including the biomass residue of the

microorganism;
b) treating the fermentation broth to substantially remove the biomass,
thereby providing a partially purified fermentation broth containing the

organic acid and/or salt thereof, unreacted substrate and other
impurities; 
c) neutralizing any residual organic acid in the partially purified
fermentation broth to produce the desired organic acid salt with a

neutralizing base in which the cation is the same as that in the desired
salt; and
d) obtaining a solution of an organic acid salt of interest, concentrated to
within ten percent (by weight) of the saturation point;
e) adding a sufficient amount of a crystallizing base to the concentrated
solution of the organic salt to produce crystals of the salt; and
f) separating the crystallized organic acid salt from its mother liquor, wherein
neutralization and concentration may be accomplished in the reverse order, as may

concentration and addition of a crystallizing base.

and the neutralizing base is a base in which the cation is an alkali metal or

alkaline earth metal cation.

from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, ammonia, sodium

carbonate, and potassium hydroxide.
The process of any of claims 1 to 3 in which the crystallizing base is sodium
hydroxide.

citrate salt.
The process of any of claims 1 to 3 in which the separated mother liquor is
treated to recover the crystallizing base.
The process of claim 3 in which the cation of the neutralizing base of step
c) is selected from the group consisting of sodium and potassium.
The process of claim 11 in which the cation of the neutralizing base is
sodium and the desired citric acid salt is trisodium citrate.
The process of claim 11 in which the cation of the neutralizing base is
potassium and the desired citric acid salt is tripotassium citrate.
