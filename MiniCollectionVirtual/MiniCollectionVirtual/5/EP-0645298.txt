<ABSTRACT>
Wheel axle for a non-driven, steerable vehicle wheel for heavy motor 
vehicles, comprising firstly, a spindle unit (9) with a pair of axially 

spaced coaxial bores for receiving a king pin and with means disposed to 
support parts of a brake machanism and, secondly, an axle stub unit 

(10), which is fixed to the wheel spindle unit (9) and on which a wheel 
hub (11) intended to be mounted.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheel axle for a non-driven, steerable vehicle wheel for
heavy motor vehicles, comprising a rigid axle beam, a king pin fixed in a bore in said axle
beam, a spindle unit with a pair of axially spaced coaxial bores which receive bearing
means mounted on opposite end portions of said king pin, and with means to support parts
of a brake mechanism, and an axle stub unit which is fixed to the spindle unit and on
which a wheel hub is intended to be mounted.Conventional wheel axles for heavy vehicles are made of forged units with the spindle unit
and the axle stub unit made together in one piece, e.g. as shown in US-A-3 441 288.
However, forged units, in contrast to cast units, cannot be made in complicated shapes. In
the case of wheel axle spindle units, these have such complicated shapes that after forging,
they must be subjected to extensive milling, reaming and/or lathing to achieve their final
shapes. The material in the forged units is high quality steel, and the waste in materials will
be expensive when chips are cut away.In wheel axle devices of this type known up to now, the braking mechanism is secured to
the spindle unit with the aid of a separate intermediate flange or adapter which is fixed to
the spindle by means of screws.US-A-3 801 124 discloses a wheel axle arrangement having an axle stub and a lower
knuckle portion of a spindle unit made in one piece as a forged unit while the rest of the
spindle unit including the upper knuckle is a cast unit. The upper and lower knuckles have
bores for upper and lower ball joints. This wheel axle arrangement does not have a rigid
axle beam and king pins and it cannot be used in heavy motor vehicles.The purpose of the present invention is in general to provide a wheel axle of the type
described by way of introduction which, while fulfilling highly set strength requirements,
can be manufactured at lower costs than wheel axles known up to now. A particular
purpose is to achieve a wheel axle 
which solves special problems arising in connection with the use of disc
brakes in heavy trucks.This is achieved according to the invention by virtue of the fact that the
spindle unit with associated support means for the brake mehcanism is a
cast unit, that the axle stub unit is a separate, forged unit and that the
spindle unit and the axle stub unit are joined together.The invention is based on the insight that the mechanical stresses on the
axle stub unit are such that for reasons of strength it should be forged, but
that the stresses

<CLAIMS>
Wheel axle arrangement for a non-driven, steerable vehicle wheel for heavy
motor vehicles, comprising a rigid axle beam (1), a king pin (3) fixed in a bore (2)

in said axle beam, a spindle unit (9) with a pair of axially spaced coaxial bores
which receive bearing means (4,5) mounted on opposite end portions of said king

pin, and with means (20) to support parts (15) of a brake mechanism, and an axle
stub unit (10) which is fixed to the spindle unit and on which a wheel hub (11) is

intended to be mounted, 
characterized in
 that the spindle unit (9) with associated

support means (20) for the brake mechanism (15) is a cast unit, that the axle stub
unit (10) is a separate, forged unit and that the spindle unit and the axle stub unit are

joined to each other.
Wheel axle according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that said support means for the
brake mechanism comprise a pair of mounting flanges (20) provided with bores, to

which flanges a brake caliper (15) for a disc brake is intended to be screwed by
means of screws received in the bores.
Wheel axle according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that the axle stub unit
(10) has a flange with bores, through which screws (16) extend into threaded bores

in the spindle unit.
