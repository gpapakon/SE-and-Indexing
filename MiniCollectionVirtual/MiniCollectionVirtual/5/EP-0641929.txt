<ABSTRACT>
A fault detection system is provided for an exhaust 
gas recirculation (EGR) system. The detection 

system is constructed of engine operation state detection 
means (71), EGR valve opening/closing means (72), 

and system operation fault detection means (73). The 
detection means (71) is provided with an air flow 

sensor (17) arranged in an intake passage on an upstream 
side of a throttle valve, and detects the engine 

operation state that the pressure difference between a 
pressure within the intake passage on a downstream side 

of the throttle valve and a pressure within the downstream-side 
intake passage is not greater than a critical 

pressure. Upon detection of the above engine operation 
state, the opening/closing means (72) opens or 

closes an EGR valve (81). When a change in the output 
from the sensor (17) between before and after the opening 

or closing of the valve (81) is determined to be 
smaller than a predetermined fault determination value, 

the detection means (73) detects that the EGR system is 
not operating properly. A fault determination zone is 

set by avoiding a critical pressure operation zone, so 
that a fault in the operation of the system can be 

detected with good accuracy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an exhaust gas recirculation 
(EGR system) in which an exhaust gas recirculation 
passage (EGR passage) extending between an intake 
system and an exhaust system in an internal combustion 
engine is opened or closed by an exhaust gas 
recirculation valve (EGR valve) to selectively recirculate 
exhaust gas to the intake system, and especially 
to a method and system for the detection of a fault of 
such an EGR system. As a conventional fault detection system for an 
EGR system, there has been proposed such a system that 
an EGR valve is opened or closed in an EGR operation 
zone but if the difference between a value detected on 
the volume of air inducted before the opening or 
closure and that detected after the opening or closure 
falls within a predetermined range, an alarm is given 
[see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (Kokai) No. 
SHO 62-51747]. Such a conventional fault detection system for an  
 
EGR system however performs a self-diagnosis even when 
the pressure difference between a pressure within said 
throttle valve downstream side intake passage and a 
pressure within said throttle valve upstream side intake 
passage exceeds a critical pressure as in an operation 
zone in which the throttle valve is controlled at 
a low angle. The term "critical pressure" as used 
herein means a pressure at which the flow velocity of 
inducted air flowing past the throttle valve reaches 
the velocity of sound, for example, a pressure of 5.60 x 104-5.73 x 104Pa (420-430 
mmHg) on the downstream side of the throttle valve 
when the pressure on the upstream side of the throttle 
valve, namely, the atmospheric pressure is 1.01 x 105 Pa (760 mmHg), 
Paying attention to the difference between a value 
detected on the volume of air inducted before the opening 
or closure of the EGR valve and that detected after 
the opening or closure, this difference falls within 
the predetermined range in the above case even if the 
EGR system is in order. The conventional fault detection 
system therefore involves the potential problem 
that the EGR system is erroneously determined to be out 
of order, resulting in production of an alarm. US-A-4,715,348, family member of JP-A-62051747, discloses a method and system for such fault detection according to the preambles of claims 1 and 2, respectively. The method and system of the present invention are characterized by the features of the characterizing portions of these claims, respectively. With the foregoing in view, the present invention  
 
has
