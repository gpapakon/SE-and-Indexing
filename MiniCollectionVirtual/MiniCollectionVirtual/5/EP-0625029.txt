<ABSTRACT>
A closed-heart method for treating ventricular tachycardia in a myocardial infarct patient afflicted with ventricular tachycardia is disclosed. The method comprises, first, defining a thin layer of spared myocardial tissue positioned between the myocardial infarct scar tissue and the inner surface of the myocardium (the endocardium) of the patient, and then ablating the thin layer of spared myocardial tissue by a closed-heart procedure with an ablation catheter. Apparatus for carrying out the method is also disclosed. Also disclosed is a method for prognosing the likelihood of ventricular tachycardia occurring in a myocardial infarct patient not previously diagnosed as afflicted with ventricular tachycardia. The method comprises detecting a thin layer of spared myocardial tissue positioned between the myocardial infarct scar tissue and the inner surface of the myocardium (the endocardium) in the patient.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for the
ablation of cardiac tissue for the treatment of
ventricular tachycardia.Ventricular tachycardia is a disease of the
heart in which the heart's normal rhythmic contraction is
altered, thus affecting heart function. The condition is
often described as a heart beat which is too fast,
although the disease is far more complex. Ventricular
tachycardia occurs most often in patients following a
myocardial infarction. A myocardial infarction, commonly
referred to as a heart attack, is a loss of blood flow to
a region of the heart causing the myocardial (muscle)
tissue in that region to die and be replaced by an area 
of scar tissue known as a myocardial infarct. In most
cases, this occurs in the left ventricle.Ventricular tachycardia ("VT") may be initiated
and sustained by a re-entrant mechanism, termed a
"circus" movement. The mechanism of re-entry, as it is
currently understood, is discussed in M. Josephson and H.
Wellens, Tachycardias: Mechanisms, Diagnosis, Treatment,
Chap. 14 (1984)(Lea & Febiger). Most cases of sudden
cardiac death that have occurred during cardiac
monitoring have begun as VT that degenerated into
ventricular fibrillation.While VT can be halted after it begins by
pacing or cardioversion, it is preferable to prevent the
arrhythmia from arising. Drug therapy has been used, but
is successful in only 30 to 50 percent of patients and
has undesirable side effects. Endocardial resection, a
surgical procedure involving removing the tissue in the
ventricle thought to be the source of the VT, has been
reported to eradicate VT in up to 90 percent of patients,
but it suffers from a 5 to 10 percent incidence of
perioperative mortality. For a discussion of surgical
procedures, see T. Ferguson and J. Cox, Surgical Therapy
for Cardiac Arrhythmias, in Nonpharmacological Therapy of
Tachyarrhythmias (G. Breithardt et al. eds. 1987).As an alternative to surgery, the technique
most often attempted is ablation. Typically, programmed
premature pacing is performed from a catheter electrode
in the right or left ventricular cavity. During
programmed premature pacing, a stimulus, usually of twice
diastolic threshold, is repeatedly given prematurely
until either VT is induced or the tissue is too
refractory to be excited. The ECG is examined during
induced VT and compared to the ECG showing spontaneous
bouts of VT. If the ECG is similar, it is assumed that
the patient's clinical VT is being induced. A mapping
catheter in the left ventricular cavity is used to record
from

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for the ablation treatment of ventricular
tachycardia, comprising:


an intraventricular catheter;
detecting means for detecting a thin layer of spared
endocardial tissue, spared endocardial tissue being tissue

still alive after myocardial infarct not scar tissue, and
connected to said intraventricular catheter;
evaluating means for evaluating whether said thin layer
has an endocardial surface area of at least 15 square

centimetres;
ablation means connected to said intraventricular
catheter for ablating said thin layer of spared endocardial

tissue if said thin layer has an area of at least 15 square
centimetres; and
prognosing means operatively associated with said
detecting means for prognosing the likelihood of ventricular

tachycardia arising from said thin layer.
An apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
prognosing means comprises a computer operatively associated

with said detecting means and being arranged to evaluate the
boundary dimensions of the thin layer areas to determine the

size of contiguous portions of said thin layer areas.
