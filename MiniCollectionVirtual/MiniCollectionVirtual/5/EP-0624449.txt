<ABSTRACT>
Molten plastic is injected into a mold cavity via a hot 
runner system including at least one shooting pot (69,79). The flow 

of molten plastic is controlled via a ball check valve (66,82) 
including the steps of opening the ball check valve (66,82) via 

injection pressure in the inlet conduit (65,88), and closing the 
ball check valve (66,82) via injection pressure from the injection 

piston (71,81) in the shooting pot (69,79).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to injecting molten 
plastic into a mold cavity via a hot runner system which 
includes a shooting pot, especially to coinjection to form 
hollow plastic articles and preforms having a layered 
structure. The use of a control unit, such as a shooting pot in a 
hot runner system for molding plastic articles is well known 
and is highly advantageous, especially in the simultaneous 
or sequential injection (coinjection) of two or more resins 
into a mold cavity to develop layered wall structures. This 
is evidenced by U.S. Patents 4,775,308, 4,717,324, 4,863,369 
and 4,863,665. In an arrangement using a shooting pot, a primary resin 
source feeds the reservoir of the shooting pot and the 
shooting pot, in turn, is operated to feed a measured or 
metered quantity of resin into the mold cavity while the 
inlet to the shooting pot from the primary resin source is 
closed. For economic reasons, it is particularly 
advantageous to feed molten plastic into a plurality of mold 
cavities via the hot runner system using at least one 
shooting pot for each mold cavity.  Naturally, the larger the system, for example, a 48 
cavity coinjection hot runner, the bulkier and more complex 
it is, especially using the advantageous shooting pots. 
Space is at a premium in such a large system, and accuracy 
is important. It is therefore a principal objective of the present 
invention to provide a method for injection molding plastic 
articles using a hot runner system and at least one shooting 
pot, which is simple, compact and effective. It is a particular object of the present invention to 
provide a method as aforesaid for coinjecting a plurality of 
hollow articles in a plurality of mold cavities using two 
shooting pots for each mold cavity. Further objects and advantages of the present invention 
will appear hereinbelow. In accordance with the present invention it has now 
been found that the foregoing objects and advantages are 
readily obtained. The present invention is an efficient and expeditious 
method of molding plastic articles, including preforms, 
bottles, containers and the like. The method of the present 
invention comprises: injection molding plastic into a mold 
cavity via a hot runner system including a conduit system  
 
therein with at least one shooting pot communicating with 
said conduit system; feeding molten plastic into said 
shooting pot from said conduit system via an inlet conduit 
of said conduit system, and feeding molten plastic from said 
shooting pot actuated

<CLAIMS>
A method of molding plastic articles (111), which 
comprises: injection molten plastic into a mold cavity (11-14, 

110) from an extruder (A, B, C) via a hot runner system 
(21-24, 36-39, 50-53) including a conduit system therein 

with at least one shooting pot (46-49, 69, 79) having a 
molten plastic reservoir (68, 78) between the extruder (A, 

B, C) and mold cavity (11-14, 110) communicating with said 

conduit system; feeding molten plastic into said shooting 
pot reservoir (68, 78) from said extruder (A, B, C) and 

conduit system via an inlet conduit (65, 88) of said 
conduit system, and feeding molten plastic from said 

shooting pot reservoir (68, 78) actuated by an injection 
system (71, 81) in the shooting pot (69, 79) to the mold 

cavity (110) via an outlet conduit (73, 80) of said conduit 
system; and controlling the flow of molten plastic via a 

check valve (26-29, 66, 82) in said inlet conduit (65, 88), 
including the steps of opening the check valve (66, 82) to 

permit flow of molten plastic past the check valve (66, 82) 
via injection pressure in the inlet conduit (65, 88), and 

closing the check valve (66, 82) to prevent flow of molten 
plastic past the check valve (66, 82) via injection 

pressure from said injection piston (71, 81) in the 
shooting pot (69, 79). 
A method according to claim 1 wherein the check valve 
is a ball check valve (66, 82), including the step of 

moving a ball (67, 82) to open and close the ball check 
valve. 
A method according to claim 2 including coinjecting 
two different molten plastic materials into said mold 

cavity (110) via said conduit system, and providing two of 
said shooting pots (69, 79) per cavity (110), one for each 

 
molten plastic material, including the steps of controlling 

the flow of molten plastic for each of said shooting pots 
via ball check valves (66, 82), wherein both ball check 

valves (66, 82) are separately opened via injection 
pressure in inlet conduits (65, 88) and both ball check 

valves (66, 82) are separately closed via injection 
pressure from the injection pistons (71, 81) in said 

shooting pots (69, 79).

including the step of injecting molten plastic from the 

shooting pot (69, 79) to the mold cavity (110) by advancing 
an injection piston (71, 81) in the shooting pot (69, 79), 

wherein the injection pressure from the injection piston 
(71, 82) in the shooting pot (69, 79) closes the ball check 

valve (66, 82) and prevents backflow of the molten plastic 
material. 
A method according to at least one of claims 1 - 7
