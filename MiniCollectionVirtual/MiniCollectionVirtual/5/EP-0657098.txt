<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises a processing device with an input 
gate to which signals can be fed which comprise information 

about a milk flow during the milking of an animal or group of 
animals. The processing device derives data from the signals, 

stores the data and processes them further. According to the 
invention, the processing device determines deviations in the 

data in relation to predetermined milk flow characteristics of 
the relevant animal or the relevant group of animals and/or 

changes in the milk flow characteristics and it signals an 
animal or group of animals in which the deviations and/or 

changes exceed predetermined values for the purpose of 
watching the reproductive status and/or health status of the 

relevant animal or the relevant group of animals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an information system for
automatically obtaining data about animals in dairy farming,
which comprises a processing device with an input gate to
which signals can be fed which comprise information about a
milk flow during the milking of an animal or a group of
animals, and in which the processing device is adapted to
derive data from said signals, store said data and further
process said data, the processing device is further adapted
to determine deviations in the data in relation to
predetermined milk flow characteristics of the relevant
animal or the relevant group of animals and/or
to update predetermined flow characteristics based on more
recently derived data and to determine changes in
said milk flow characteristics, and to signal an animal or
group of animals in which the deviations and/or changes
exceed predetermined values, for the purpose of watching the
reproductive status and/or health status of the relevant
animal or the relevant group of animals.Such a system is disclosed in U.S. patent 5,152,246.
During automatic milking, this system measures the milk flow
from the udder of a cow with a view to automatically stopping
the milking timely.In accordance with the invention the processing device
is also adapted to determine from said signals an expected value of said data
and a maximum permissible deviation from said expected value
by means of statistical technics for obtaining said
predetermined milk flow characteristics. In accordance with
the invention, therefore, data regarding the milk flow are
used to give indications with regard to the fertility status
and the health of the milk-yielding animal. By statistically
processing these measured values, changes in the milk flow
characteristics or deviations from those characteristics can 
be traced by the information system and be made known. The
purpose of the information system is to support the dairy
farmer in managing his stock.The milk flow characteristics mentioned comprise an
expected value and a maximum permissible deviation. Thus, for
instance, the difference between the received data and the
expected value can be determined. If the difference is
greater than the maximum permissible deviation, the animal or
the group of animals is signalled by the system. A farmer can
then investigate, for instance, whether the animal is ill or
establish that the animal is fertile.More particularly, the processing device processes the
above-mentioned signals into statistical information for
obtaining the milk flow
