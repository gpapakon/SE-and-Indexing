<ABSTRACT>
There is described herein a method for the 
continuous preparation of a heat-vulcanizing silicone 

rubber compounds. The method comprises continuous 

feeding of (A) 100 weight parts polydiorganosiloxane 
gum, (B) 5 to 100 weight parts reinforcing filler, and 

(C) up to 30 weight parts processing aid to a co-rotating 
twin-screw continuous compounding extruder. 

The components (A), (B), and (C) are continuously mixed 
in the extruder at a temperature in a range of about 

200°C to 300°C. The mixed components are then 
discharged, forming an extrudate. The extrudate is fed 

continuously to a counter-rotating twin-screw 
continuous compounding extruder, wherein the extrudate 

is continuously heat-treated at a temperature in a 
range of 150°C to 300°C, forming the silicone rubber 

compound, which is then discharged from the counter-rotating 
twin-screw continuous compounding extruder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a continuous
method for the preparation of heat-vulcanizing silicone
rubber compounds.Heat-vulcanizing silicone rubber compounds
comprised of polydiorganosiloxane gum, inorganic
filler, and an optional processing aid are known as
base compounds for the fabrication of silicone rubber
moldings. Such heat-vulcanizing silicone rubber
compounds are generally supplied by silicone producers
to silicone rubber molding operations, where they are
first blended with curing agent, typically an
organoperoxide, and then molded or formed into silicone
rubber moldings.These heat-vulcanizing silicone rubber
compounds have been prepared by the introduction of
their constituent components into a large mixer
equipped with two mixing blades (kneader mixer),
followed by mixing while heating.However, the high-productivity manufacture of
a homogeneous, time-stable heat-vulcanizing silicone
rubber compound by this prior preparative method is
quite problematic. Specifically, the aforesaid prior
preparative method frequently yields a silicone rubber
compound that is very prone to plasticity retrogression
(crepe hardening with elapsed time). Mixing for long
periods of time while heating at high temperatures has
been necessary in order to avoid this. For example,
heating and mixing for 6 to 48 hours is necessary in
order to prepare a homogeneous heat-vulcanizing
silicone rubber compound that is free of time-dependent
changes. In addition, there are limits on the ability
to scale-up the kneader mixer itself. Japanese Application [Kokai] 2-102007
proposes a method for the continuous preparation of
silicone rubber compounds in which the constituent
components of a heat-vulcanizing silicone rubber
compound are converted into a particulate mixture and
this particulate mixture is then fed to a twin-screw
continuous compounding extruder. This method, however,
requires the execution of a complicated step in which
the polydiorganosiloxane gum, inorganic filler, and
processing aid are temporarily converted into said
particulate mixture through the use of a means such as
a high-speed mixer, etc. Thus, this method cannot be
viewed as having an intrinsically excellent
productivity.EP-A 0 258 159 discloses a method for preparation of heat-vulcanizing
silicone rubber compounds wherein a twin-screw
extruder is used in a first step. The material which has passed
through the double twin-screw extruder is then transferred into
a second apparatus where pressure is applied. This second
apparatus can be a single-screw
