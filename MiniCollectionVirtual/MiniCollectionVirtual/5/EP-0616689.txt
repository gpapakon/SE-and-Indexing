<ABSTRACT>
A fluid sampling module for utilization in on-line real time fluid monitoring systems. The fluid sampling module can be utilized as a urea input module in a hemodialysis treatment. The hemodialysis monitoring system quantitates the rate and amount of urea removed during the hemodialysis treatment by measuring the urea concentrations as a function of time in the spent dialysate effluent from a hemodialysis machine. The urea input module interfaces with the dialysate effluent waste line from the hemodialysis machine and periodically removes a quantity of the spent dialysate effluent for measurement. The urea input module detects low flow rates and eliminates low flow rate flutter. The urea input module includes a resealable make before break docking interface with the dialysate effluent line and preferably includes a filter between the urea input module and the urea sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to fluid sampling, and more
particularly is directed to a flow sensing and fluid sampling module for on line
real time monitoring of a fluid process.The fluid sampling module of the invention can be utilized in any type of
process, wherein a Newtonian fluid is or can be flowing. Many types of
industrial processes require additions of different fluids and it is important and
often critical to sample the fluids as they are added to the process. Different
types or different concentrations can be added through the same line or a plurality
of different lines. To provide proper process control, each fluid should be
sampled so that the type, concentration, etc. of the various fluids can be
monitored. To effectively sample the fluids, it can be required to obtain the
sample from the fluid when it is under at least minimal flow conditions.
Therefore, the fluid sampling module of the present invention includes sensing of
the fluid flow to ensure that sampling of the fluid only occurs during a period of
sufficient fluid flow. Applicants have discovered a particular use for the fluid sampling module
in the hemodialysis treatment, such as performed by hemodialysis machines.
Therefore, although the present invention is not limited to a particular fluid or
fluid process, for purposes of describing a specific example, the hemodialysis
treatment will be described hereinafter in detail.The use of dialyzer cartridges with hemodialysis machines to remove
blood-borne toxins and by-products of metabolism has been conventional for
many years. Typically, such a cartridge contains essentially a pair of chambers
separated by a semipermeable membrane. Blood is perfused through the first
chamber and returned to the patient. The dialysate solution is simultaneously
circulated in the opposite direction through the second chamber. A concentration
gradient thereby is established which causes waste products carried in the blood
to migrate through the semipermeable membrane and into the dialysate solution
to form the dialysate effluent.The principle of hemodialysis has been refined extensively. A number of
semipermeable hollow fiber membranes are now utilized in dialyzer cartridges to
greatly increase the total membrane surface area to facilitate diffusion across the
membrane structure. The hollow fiber membranes include a variety of materials
including, for example, cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, polyacrylonitrile,
polysulfone, and regenerated cellulose, the latter being most commonly
