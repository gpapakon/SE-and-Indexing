<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a package, particularly but not
exclusively for packs of sanitary products, for example, plastics packs for
products such as babies' disposable nappies.Plastics bags are becoming the most widespread type of pack for sanitary
products such as babies' disposable nappies and are particularly suitable
for compressed products, that is, products which have been subjected to a
certain degree of compression before insertion in the bags in order to
obtain smaller packs which occupy less space and use less raw material.Once packed, the bags are packaged in corrugated cardboard boxes for
despatch; the cardboard box simplifies the handling and transportation of
the bags and also constitutes a sales unit for the product.However, cardboard boxes represent a considerable quantity of material
which has to be purchased and stored by the user who uses it to pack 
products and which, once the goods have arrived at their destination, is
then generally disposed of by the purchaser.Moreover, when bags of disposable nappies are packaged in cardboard
boxes the space inside the boxes cannot be fully utilised because of the
tolerances imposed by the usual automatic mechanical boxing systems
generally used.The problem of the utilization of space is made even more important by
the increasingly widespread use of pallets of standard dimensions for the
transportation of the boxes, in response to the requirements of large
distribution and sales organisations. US 2,703,764 discloses a package
as described in the preamble of appended claim 1. In this package
a number of units are assembled
together in pairs and in a stacked relationship. Band tapes serve to maintain
all the pairs as a rigid unit. To remove one of the pairs from the unit, it is
only necessary to twist such a pair in either direction to cause the tape to
tear at the meeting edges of the pairs to be separated. The tape comprises
embrittled portions to facilitate the twisting. Furthermore, spots of adhesive
may be provided at the meeting edges of one or more of the respective pairs
in order to anchor the respective pairs more effectively. The object of the present invention is to improve the characteristics of
packages, for example, for plastics packs of sanitary hygiene products,
such as babies' disposable nappies, by means of a package which avoids
the use of corrugated cardboard boxes and which has the characteristics
recited in the following claims.Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become clear
from the
