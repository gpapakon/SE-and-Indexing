<ABSTRACT>
A technique for generating gated clock signals 
(Q⊘-6) for use in enabling various operating gating units 

(12) in a data processing system in which an internal 
reference clock signal (Q
R
) is used to generate both 
processor clock signals (CLK⊘-5) for the processor (11) 

and the gated clock signals such that the latter signals 
are substantially synchronous with the processor clock 

signals. D-flip-flop circuitry (30) together with a 
delay unit (33) having an adjustable time delay are used 

to generate a gated clock signal. The overall time 
delay, from the time of which the circuitry is enabled 

until the gated clock signal is produced, is appropriately 
set by selecting the required time delay so that the 

overall time delay is essentially the same as the time 
delay required to generate the processor clock signals. 

Accordingly, the edges of the gated clock signals can be 
made to coincide with the edges of the processor clock 

signals. The use of such gated clock signal generation 
circuitry can reduce the time needed to generate the gated 

clock signals from that required by previously used 
register PAL circuitry to improve performance of the 

processing system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to clocking units for
providing clock signals for use in digital data processing
systems and, more particularly, to an improved clocking unit for
providing processor clock signals having fixed periods for
clocking the operations of various components of the processing
system and for further providing controllable gated clock signals
having controllable edges that are substantially synchronous with
edges of the processor clock signals for enabling the operation
of various gating components of the system.Data processing systems normally require a plurality of
internally generated processor clock signals derived from a
reference clock signal, which processor clock signals have the
same fixed periods and are available for clocking the operations
of various components throughout the system. In a particular
embodiment, for example, a first group of such internal processor
clock signals are in phase with each other, while one or more
other internal processor clock signals are either 90° or 180° out
of phase with the first group.In addition, many operating components in the system must be
supplied with controllable gated clocked signals in order to be
operable at the proper times, e.g., gated "select" signals for
operating multiplexor units, gated "enabling" signals for
operating latch units, and the like. Such latter units normally 
require the generation of gated signals as obtained from
appropriate logic components, such as register programmed
array logic (PAL) units. The operation of such PAL units
inserts a time delay in the generation and supplying of the
gated clock signals, which time delay, combined with other
time delays inherent in the operation of the unit to which a
gated signal is supplied, require a particular number of
operating time cycles for the overall operation of
generating and supplying such gated clock signals. If the
time delays which arise in the generation and supplying of
the gated signal can be reduced, in many cases the number of
operating time cycles required for the overall operation of
the gated unit can be reduced so as to improve the speed of
operation of the processing system as a whole.The invention is defined in the independent claims
below to which reference should now be made. Preferred
features are set forth in the dependent claims.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
invention, gated clock signals used for gating the
operations of certain components of the system are generated
by a specially designed gated clock generation
