Process for measuring the electrical conductivity of
cervical and/or vaginal mucus, using a plurality of

measurement electrodes attached at various
measurement sites on a part of the body, for the

purpose of ascertaining levels of electrical
resistance, characterised in that the measurement

process uses alternating current and a measurement
probe incorporating the measurement electrodes, and

that the respective resistance levels ascertained by
the measurement electrodes are scanned and the lowest

resistance level are evaluated as a reference
variable for determining the electrical conductivity.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the measurement electrodes are used to perform point-focal

measurement.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the measurement of conductivity is a long-term

measurement performed at defined measurement
intervals.
Process according to claim 3, characterised in that
the measurement intervals are quarter-minute, half-minute

or one-minute intervals.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that measurement by means of the

measurement probe incorporating the measurement
electrodes takes place in the cervix/vagina in order

to detect oestrus or determine the occurrence of
ovulation. 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in that
the result of the measurement rePresents an absolute

impedance value.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that ionic secretions in mucus

and/or the body temperatures are ascertained, in
addition to the conductivity of the cervical and/or

vaginal mucus.
Measurement Probe for carrying out the process
according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in

that a fairly large number of point electrodes (3)
are distributed over the probe surface (2) and a

common earth (5, 8) is assigned to the point
electrodes, in such a manner that a conducting ring

earth (5) is arranged concentrically to the

respective Point electrode (3), and an insulation
ring (4) is arranged between the electrode Pair

formed by the point electrode (3) and the ring earth
(5) assigned to it.
Measurement probe for carrying out the process
according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterised in

that a fairly large number of Point electrodes (3)
are distributed over the probe surface (2) and a

common earth (5, 8) is assigned to the point
electrodes, in such a manner that an insulation ring

(4) is arranged around the respective Point electrode
(3) and the remaining probe surface (8) has a

conducting earth surface.
Measurement probe according to either of claims 8 or
9, characterised in that the point electrodes (3) and

the earth rings (5) and earth surface (8) consist of
non-oxidising, conductive material, in particular

gold. 
Measurement probe according to any of claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that it is a cylindrical

construction with rounded ends or else a sphere.
Measurement probe according to any of claims 8 to 11,
characterised in that it has ion-sensitive electrodes

and/or temperature electrodes.
