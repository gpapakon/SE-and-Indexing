<ABSTRACT>
A power supply circuit is proposed which contains a first control circuit (21) which operates a switching-on current limiting circuit (11) as a function of a voltage difference between a load (10) and a power source (12). In an advantageous development, a second control circuit (28) is provided which likewise emits an operating signal (29) to the switching-on current limiting circuit (11) as a function of a drop in the voltage applied to the load (10). The power supply circuit according to the invention prevents the occurrence of sparks when plug contacts (13, 14) make contact with connections (15) of the power source (12). The power supply circuit according to the invention is particularly suitable for battery-operated loads (10) such as, for example, motor vehicle test equipment which has to be connected into a motor vehicle battery as the power source (12).
