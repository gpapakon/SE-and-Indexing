<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transmission for converting a rotational movement into a positively guided linear reciprocating movement at right angles to the axis of rotation, in particular for locking and unlocking a steering-wheel lock of a motor vehicle, with a displaceably mounted slotted guide link 3 having a longitudinal orifice 4, in which a rotor 5 with lateral wings 6 is arranged, the wings bearing on guide faces 12 of the slotted link. The rotor 5 has, in addition to the wings 6, a cam 8 which is arranged centrally relative to these and which is at least also assigned a guide face 11 of the slotted link, at least one of the wings 6 and the cam 8 always bearing on the guide faces or being near these.

<CLAIMS>
A mechanism for converting a rotational movement into a 
restricted linear to and fro movement at right angles to 

the axis of rotation, in particular for locking and 
unlocking a steering lock of a motor vehicle, having a 

displaceably mounted guide link (3) with a slot (4) in 
which a rotor (5) having lateral blades (6) is disposed, 

with the blades abutting guide faces (12) of the link, 
characterised in that in addition to the blades (6) the 

rotor has a cam (8) disposed centrally thereto, with 
which at least also one guide face (11) of the link is 

associated, with at least one of the blades (6) and the 
cam (8) always abutting its guide faces or being close 

thereto. 
A mechanism according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the guide face (11) of the link (3) 
provided for the cam (8) is tooth-shaped. 
A mechanism according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 two guide faces (11), which are 
curved (and) abut one another at an obt
use angle, are 
provided for the cam (8). 
A mechanism according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 the guide faces (11) provided for 
the cam (8) are concavely curved. 
A mechanism according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the cam (8) is tooth-shaped. 
A mechanism according to Claim 1 to 3,
characterised in that
 blades (6) and cam (8) are 
connected in one piece to the rotor (5).  

 
A mechanism according to Claim 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the two guide faces (12) at the 
guide link (3) provided for the blades (6) are disposed 

at approximately the same height in relation to one 
another roughly at blade width distance (B) beneath the 

axis of rotation (C).
