<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in adhesives, in 
particular, improved denture adhesives. Ordinary removable dentures, dental plates, and the like, 
comprise teeth mounted in a suitable plate or base. Dentures 
function as a substitute for missing teeth and serve as a replacement 
for all or a portion of the teeth ordinarily found in the 
oral cavity. Although dentures generally are skillfully prepared, 
often they do not fit perfectly. Moreover, no matter how satisfactory 
at first, after a period of time the fit of the denture 
becomes loose and imperfect due to natural shrinkage and changes 
in the gums, mucous tissues, and the like. Loose and imperfectly 
fitted dentures usually are corrected and stabilized by the use of 
a denture adhesive. Denture adhesives are used to fill the 
interstices between the dentures and the gums or tissues. Prior 
to placement of the denture in the oral cavity, a denture adhesive 
is applied to the denture-plate surface which, for a perfect fit, 
should uniformly contact the gums and mucous tissues. The denture 
adhesive is formulated not only for its adherent properties, but 
also to provide a cushion or gasket between the denture and the 
gums or tissues, thereby positioning the denture securely in the 
oral cavity. Requirements and characteristics for a satisfactory denture 
adhesive composition are many and are dictated by numerous 
factors. Desirably, one daily application of such a composition 
should function as an effective means for insulating, cushioning, 
and securely positioning the denture. The composition should 
retain its characteristics and properties in the typical powder 
and cream forms during storage under various climatic conditions  
 
such as high temperature and humidity; be readily and easily 
capable of application to the denture surface; not be irritating 
or uncomfortable to the user; be safe and nontoxic; have no 
disagreeable odor or color; have no unpalatable taste; optionally 
provide antiseptic and germicidal properties for preventing or 
inhibiting the growth of organisms ordinarily found in the mouth; 
and function as an agent for prevention of putrefaction or malodorous 
decomposition of foods or secretions lodging beneath or 
adjacent to the denture. The adhesive should not attack or damage 
the denture. Additionally, the adhesive should be stable to 
bacteria, molds and enzyme systems found in the oral cavity, and 
have a pH that is nonirritating to the oral mucosa. The 
mechanical strength of the adhesive mass, be it gel

<CLAIMS>
A denture adhesive composition comprising a mixture of: 

(a) an effective adhesive amount of a hydrophilic powder 
or liquid or mixture thereof and 
(b) a liquid vehicle, that cures and forms a peelable 
solid upon 2-part mixing and/or exposure to 

saliva/water, selected from 1 and 2-part Room Temperature 
Vulcanising Compositions (RTVs) such as silicones, polyethers, 

polyethenes, polysulfides and epoxies. 
The composition of Claim 1 wherein component (a) is 
selected from the group consisting of mixed partial salts 

of alkyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride copolymers 
(AVE/MA), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), 

polyethylene oxide (PEO), karaya gum, polyethylene glycol 
(PEG); sodium alginate, hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC), 

chitosan, guar gum, polyacrylic acid, acid form of alkyl 
vinyl ether maleic anhydride copolymer, carbopol 

polymers, polyvinyl alcohol, polyamines, polyquaternary 
compounds, and mixtures thereof and the RTV 

is selected from 
poly siloxane, polyether, 

polysulfide, and mixtures thereof. 
The composition of either of Claims 1 or 2 wherein 
component (a) comprises mixed partial salts of AVE/MA, 

CMC, PEO, karaya gum and/or HEC. 
The composition of any of Claims 1-3 wherein component 
(b) is an addition cured 2-part silicone RTV wherein part 

1 is a blend of vinyl functional silicone polymers, and a 
platinum catalyst and/or silica and/or inhibitors; and 

part 2 is a blend of vinyl functional silicone polymers, 
and a hydride functional siloxanes and/or silica.  

 
The composition of any of Claims 1-3 wherein component 
(b) is an addition cured 2-part silicone RTV wherein part 

1 is a blend of vinyl-terminated polydimethyl siloxane, 
and a platinum-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane complex 

catalyst and/or silica; and part 2
 
is a blend of vinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane, and 

a polydimethylsiloxane polymer containing Si-H groups 
and/or silica. 
The composition of any of Claims 1-3 wherein component 
(b) is a 2-part condensation cured silicone RTV wherein 

part 1 is a blend of silanol-terminated silicone 
polymers, and alkoxy functional silicon compounds, and 

silica and/or diatomaceous earth; and part 2 is a tin 
and/or zinc catalyst. 
The composition of any of Claims 1-3 wherein component 
(b) is a 2-part condensation cured silicone RTV wherein 

part 1 is a blend of silanol-terminated silicone 
polymers, and hydride functional siloxanes, and silica 

and/or diatomaceous earth; and part 2 is a tin and/or 
zinc catalyst. 
The composition of any of Claims 1-3 wherein component 
(b) is a 1-part silicone RTV that cures by exposure to 

saliva/water with or without a basic additive to 
neutralize the acidic by-products. 
The composition of any of Claims 1-8 wherein component 
(b) is converted to a 1-part system via 

microencapsulation. 
The composition of Claim 2 further comprising a silicone 
fluid, grease, gum, resin or mixtures thereof, which is 

not a RTV.  
 
The composition of Claim 2 where (b) is a 1- or 2-part 
silicone RTV liquid modified to contain carboxyl, 

hydroxyl and/or amino functional groups.
