<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymerizable compositions and in-mold
cured products obtained from such compositions
(hereinafter referred to simply as "molded products").Polymerizable compositions containing polymerizable liquid
resins are used widely. For example, molded products of
polymerizable compositions containing an unsaturated
polyester resin, which is a representative example of a
polymerizable liquid resin, are being used as external panels
and accessories of automobiles. There are a number of molding
methods available for obtaining molded products of
polymerizable compositions including, compression molding,
which uses sheet molding compound (SMC); injection molding,
which uses bulk molding compound (BMC); the hand lay-up
method, whereby polymerizable compositions impregnate a
reinforcing fiber mat, textile or strands, and are hardened;
the pultrusion method; and the resin transfer molding (RTM)
and reaction injection molding (RIM) methods, whereby a
polymerizable composition is introduced into a mold for quick
in-mold curing.Examples of prior art polymerizable compositions containing
unsaturated urethane are, Japanese Patent Publication Tokkai
57-182312, US-A-4043982, US-A-3954584 andJapanese Patent 
Publication Tokkai 61-225210. These publications have
disclosed compositions containing polymerizable liquid resins
comprising an unsaturated urethane and an alkyl (meth)acrylate
obtained from polyisocyanate and hydroxyl alkyl
(meth)acrylate.The aforementioned prior art polymerizable compositions,
however, have the following disadvantages because of their use
of unsaturated urethanes obtained from polyisocyanates and
hydroxy alkyl (meth)acrylates:
(1) Since the unsaturated urethane thus obtained contains
many urethane bonds within its molecule (like most other kinds
of polyurethane liquid resins), it has inferior water
resistance properties, as compared to other thermosetting
polymerizable compositions. This limits the use of the molded
products obtained by in-mold curing; and(2) Since the density of cross-linkage is high in molded
products obtained by in-mold curing, shrinkage during
hardening is large, in comparison to unsaturated polyester
liquid resins. As a result, the generation of cracks and
appearance of fiber patterns are prominently observed. Low
shrinkage agents may be used for preventing such phenomena but
they are not very effective.The basic object of the present invention is to eliminate
the disadvantages (1) and (2) given above, relating to
prior art polymerizable compositions
