Detachable bracket forming a wall bottom skirting for 
fixing electrical and/or fluid connections facilitating the 

incorporation and concealment of cables and ducts, characterized 
in that said bracket (1,2,3) is shaped like a stretched 

Z and positioned vertically, its median flange (1) serving 
as a support for the connections (4) and bearing 

at three points in a cavity (5) made in the lower part of 
the wall (6), an abutment point (7) in the upper part of 

the upper flange (2) of the Z, a support point (8) in the 
upper part of the lower flange (3) of the Z and a fixing 

point (9) forming an abutment in the lower part of the lower 
flange (3) of the Z. 
Detachable bracket according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the upper (2), median (1) and lower (3) flanges forming 

the shape of the stretched Z of said bracket (1,2,3) 
have substantially equal dimensions. 
Detachable bracket according to one of the claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that the flanges constituting the 

shape of the stretched Z of said bracket (1,2,3) have different 
thicknesses and in particular the lower flange (3) is 

thicker than the two others (1,2). 
Detachable bracelet according to one of the claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the flanges constituting the 

shape of the stretched Z of said bracket (1,2,3) are obtained 
from two or three separate, dismantlable elements. 
Detachable bracelet according to one of the claims 1 
to 4, characterized in that the flanges of the stretched 

Z of said bracket (1,2,3) are made from different materials  
 

and in particular the upper (2) and median (1) flanges are 
made from less rigid materials than the lower flange (3). 
Detachable bracket according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the abutment (7) on which bears the upper 

part of the upper flange (2) of the Z is formed in the upper 
part of the cavity (5) made in the lower part of the wall 

(6) limiting the horizontal displacement of the upper flange 
(2) of said bracket (1,2,3). 
Detachable bracket according to one of the claims 1 
or 6, characterized in that the abutment (7) in the upper 

part of the cavity is produced with the aid of a joined element 
(10) fixed to the wall and able to serve as a decorative 

pattern. 
Detachable bracelet according to one of the claims 1 
or 6 or 7, characterized in that the support point (8) on 

which bears the upper part of the lower flange (3) 
of the Z is formed in the lower part of the cavity (5) also 

serving as a rotation and sliding point for the lower flange 
(3) of said bracket (1,2,3) during its assembly or disassembly. 
Detachable bracket according to one of the claims 1 
or 6 to 8, characterized in that the fixing in the lower 

part of the lower flange (3) of said bracket (1,2,3) is carried 
out in the lower part of the cavity (5) with the aid 

of means (11) forming an abutment and facilitating assembly 
and disassembly operations, such as clips which are not visible 

on the front face of said flange. 
Detachable bracket according to one of the claims 1 
or 6 to 9, characterized in that the bearing points 

serving as abutment (7), support (8) and fixing (9) points  
 

for the said bracken (1,2,3) are formed by a section (12) 
housed in the cavity (5) made in the lower part of the wall 

(6) and able to serve as a support for the wall (6), as well 
as for the cables and ducts.
