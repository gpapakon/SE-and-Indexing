<ABSTRACT>
Methods for visual inspection of subsurface environment by emplacing a substantially visually clear pipe or casing (11) into the subsurface environment and thereafter introducing visual inspection means, such as a video camera (17) into the pipe (11), whereby inspection of the subsurface environment may be accomplished directly through the wall of the pipe. The inspection may also be accomplished by emplacing an opaque pipe provided with spaced apart visually clear windows (43) into the subsurface, and thereafter introducing visual inspection means (17) into the pipe to inspect subsurface environments through the windows of the pipe. The invention additionally includes improved piping or casing which is constructed of typical opaque materials such as steel (41) but which is provided with visually clear windows (43) appropriately spaced throughout the casing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods and
apparatus for investigating and/or inspecting subsurface
environments, and more particularly to methods for visual
inspection of such subsurface environments, and even more
particularly to methods which allow devices such as video
cameras to be employed in conducting such investigations.
The invention also includes improved apparatus for use in
conducting such investigations and explorations.The reasons for investigating, exploring or
inspecting the subsurface environment are almost endless
in number. A borehole is an artificial excavation
typically made to extract water, oil, gas and other
materials from the earth. There of course is also the
use of boreholes for exploration and inspection purposes.
For example, boreholes are drilled in the earth to locate
mineral or gas or oil deposits, to help locate the most
accessible ground water reservoirs, geothermal supplies,
and to check for subsurface integrity and stability for
location of depositories for nuclear waste and other
materials that require underground storage.
Additionally, the demand for ground water resources has
accelerated so rapidly in recent years that the demand is
at a point where new sources of high quality water are
increasingly difficult to find since so many of the most
accessible reservoirs are already tapped and utilized.
Thus utilization of a variety exploration techniques is
essential in locating new aquifers of high quality water.
Additionally, the measuring of fluid movement within the
subsurface can be of great significance. Thus, the need
to characterize subsurface conditions is of immense
commercial and environmental importance. It is of course possible, in large diameter
boreholes, to physically lower a trained geologist into
the hole with a light source to visually examine the
stratification, fracturing and layering of various
geological formations to the depth that the borehole
penetrates. However, such a technique has severe
limitations from both a practical and safety standpoint.
A significant advance has been made by virtue of closed
circuit television camera systems for visually examining
the walls of a given borehole as disclosed in US-A-4 885 820. Television cameras
measuring as small as 40 mm (1-1/2 inches) in diameter are
capable of surveying deep into holes to provide sharp
images of actual subsurface conditions. Such cameras are
designed to meet the inspection needs of the ground water
industry; gas, oil and mining industries; public works
officials; environmentalists
