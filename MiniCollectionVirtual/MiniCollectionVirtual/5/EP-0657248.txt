<ABSTRACT>
The invention discloses a lapping head comprising a casing 
(22), supporting a plurality of lapping wheels (124; 224), 

supported by a central shaft (2) connected with a driving 
element (50) and containing bevel pinions (13) caused to 

rotate by kinematic elements. Each of said lapping wheels 
(124) is attached to the end (123) of a pivot (122), eccentrically 

connected in the hole (16) of one of said bevel 
pinions (13), provided with a spheric body (125) suited to 

allow, during the rotating motion the rotation of said 
lapping head, a conic motion of revolution of the longitudinal 

axis (129) of said pivot (122) and of the lapping 
wheel attached to it in relation to the longitudinal axis 

of the corresponding bevel pinion (13), and a simultaneous 
motion of revolution of said lapping wheel in relation to 

the axis of rotation (100) of the lapping head itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns the realization of an improved 
lapping head for slabs of rocky material. It is a known fact that the lapping of marble, granite 
slabs and rocky materials in general, is performed by means 
of lapping heads presenting oscillating abrasive sectors. Said lapping heads consist of a body having a cylindrical 
or polyhedral shape which supports on the outer surface a 
plurality of lapping wheels (see for example EP-A-0 437 831). The head is caused to rotate around its vertical axis so as 
to set into rotation the lapping wheels arranged around its 
periphery which, simultaneously, are also caused to oscillate 
each around a horizontal axis. The lapping of the plate is therefore obtained by the 
abrasive action of the lapping wheels which combine the 
rotating motion around a vertical axis with the oscillating 
motion of each one on a vertical flat surface. In some types of lapping heads belonging to the known 
technique, the rotational movement of the head and the 
oscillation of the lapping wheels are obtained through a 
kinematism consisting of a pinion which simultaneously 
engages with two toothed wheels co-axial with one another, 
one of which is attached to the body of the head while the 
other one is attached to a cam. Whenever the pinion rotates both the toothed wheels are 
caused to rotate, thus causing both the rotating motion of 
central body of the head and the rotating motion of the 
cam. This one, when rotating, contrasts against the levers 
connected to the shafts supporting the lapping wheels and 
causes, therefore, the oscillating motion of the lapping 
wheels themselves. Since the two toothed wheels present a number of teeth 
slightly different from one another, the cam rotates with a  
 
slightly different speed in relation to the body of the 
lapping head and then the oscillating motions per minute 
performed by the lapping wheels around their own axis are 
considerably lower in relation to the number of revolutions 
per minute performed by the body of the head. Besides, the lower the number of oscillating motions the 
lower the relative speed between the two toothed wheels and 
therefore, in conclusion, the number of their teeth differs. One of the inconveniences that the lapping heads of such a 
type present is given by the high maintenance that they 
require. In fact, since the pinion rotates at a high speed, it 
constantly needs a perfect lubrication. If this is neglected even for a short time, because of the 
particular environment presenting a high content of
