<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is that of safety and arming apparatuses for explosive objects of the mine type. The safety and arming apparatus (2) according to the invention, for an explosive object (1) of the mine type launched from a launch tube (3), includes at least one fuse-holder flap (4) immobilised by a latch (6) which is intended to be held by an internal surface of the launch tube, it is characterised in that it includes holding means intended to be interposed between the internal surface of the launch tube and the latch and to make sure that this latch is kept in the flap locked position by the tube. Application to the field of scatterable mines.

<CLAIMS>
A safety and arming device (2) for an explosive
device (1) such as a mine, rocket or missile launched from

a launcher tube (3), which comprises a primer-carrying
shutter (4) immobilized by at least one lock (6) intended

to be held in place by an inner surface of the launcher
tube, 
characterized in that
 it incorporates a blade (43)
intended to come between the inner surface of the launcher

tube (3) and the lock (6) by exerting a substantially
constant load on the latter and intended to ensure that

the lock is held in place by the tube in the locked
shutter position, the blade being deformed beyond its

yield strength without exceeding its breaking point when
the explosive device is in place in the launcher tube.
A safety and arming device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the blade (43) comprises at least

three folds, a first fold (57) pressing against the lock,
the two other folds (58a,58b) pressing against an inner

surface of the launcher tube, when the latter is in place
in the launcher tube.
A safety and arming device according to either
one of Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the blade (43)

comprises at least five folds, a first fold (57) pressing
against the lock, two other folds (58a, 58b) pressing

against the inner surface of the launcher tube and the
last two (59a, 59b) pressing against the body of the

explosive device, when the latter is in place in the
launcher tube.
A safety and arming device according to any one
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the blade (43) is

integral with one of the faces of the explosive device.
A safety and arming device for an explosive
device of the mine type fitted with stabilizing tabs (44)

according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the blade (43) is integral with one of the tabs.
