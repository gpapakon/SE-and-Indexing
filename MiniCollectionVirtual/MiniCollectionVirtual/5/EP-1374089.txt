<ABSTRACT>
A method and arrangement in a computer client/server constellation provides a web page information element monitoring service to a subscribing user. The client part (100) in co-operation with the first browser, operated by teh user, acqueres a user specified web page, generages a position specifying unique first ID on basis of a user selected first information object contained on the web page, and transfers the first ID to the server part (600). The server part (600), in co-operation with a second browser, reacquires the web page and generates a second unique ID on basis of a second information object found at a position provided by the first ID, and generates a change indicator if the second ID is different from the first ID. The change indicator triggers a notification of the detected change to the subscribing user.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD AND ARRANGEMENT FOR WEB INFORMATION MONITORINGThe invention relates to the field of computer data processing, and particularly to processing of structured data to detect a data change and to generate a notification in relation to the detected change.By the advent of the internet, enormous amounts of information have become easily accessable. The internet gives users access to more than 2.1 billion web sites, and the rate of growth has been shown to be about 80 new web sites per second. Thus, more than 550 billion documents may be accessed by users of the internet. Furthermore, a large part of the information being available through the internet is variable or floating information that may change over time, and users will more or less frequently access sites to check if the information of interest has been updated. Statistics have shown that 43% of internet users access about 20 web sites each month to look for such updates. Accordingly, there is a need for a solution that will assist a user of web site information in finding out whether or not information at web site of interest has changes, such as for example by an update. Furthermore, there is a need for a solution as identified above, being capable of providing a notification to a user when a change is detected.In the art, there are several solutions offered that provide a data monitoring service, some of which also provide a service capable of being personalized.One category of existing solutions is regularly referred to as "MyPortal" solutions, such as for example those offered by the web sites of My Yahoo™, MoreOver™, Net2One™, LifeMinders™, Yoodle™ and Made4™. In the solutions, the user typically is given a choice to personalize a "My Portal Page", and a notification of change is delivered to that page. In the solutions, the selections of web sites (or other web information items) that are made available to the user for monitoring through the respective service is limited to those sites (or other web information items) that are specified by the monitoring service provider, or by some other entity with whom the monitoring service provider has a feeder agreement.Another category of known web information monitoring services encompasses solutions typically referred to as "Wireless Alerts" solutions. Examples of such solutions can be found at the web sites of My Alert™, IOBox™ and 12Snaps™. Web information monitoring by the solutions appear to be similar to those belonging to the previously mentioned "MyPortal" category, with the addition of a
