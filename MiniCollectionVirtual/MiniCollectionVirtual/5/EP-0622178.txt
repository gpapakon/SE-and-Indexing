<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to reinforced polymeric 
laminates. More particularly, the present invention is 
related to corrosion resistant reinforced thermosetting 
plastic laminates, and a surfacing veil for 
incorporation in the laminates. The use of surfacing veil as the primary 
corrosion barrier in thermoset resin fiber reinforced 
laminates is well known in the glass fiber reinforced 
plastic industry. In the American Society for Testing and 
Materials (hereinafter ASTM) C 582 - 87 entitled 
Standard Specification for Contact-Molded Reinforced 
Thermosetting Plastic (RTP) Laminates for Corrosion 
Resistant Equipment, contact molding is defined in 
section 3.4 as "...a method of fabrication wherein the 
glass-fiber reinforcement is applied to the mold, in 
the form of chopped-strand mat or woven roving, by hand 
or from a reel, or in the form of chopped strands of 
continuous-filament glass from a chopper-spray gun. 
The resin matrix is applied by various methods, 
including brush, roller, or spray gun. Consolidation 
of the composite laminate is by rolling." A surfacing veil or mat is defined in ASTM C 
582 - 87, ASTM D 4097 - 88, and ASTM D 3299 - 88. A 
surfacing veil or mat is defined in ASTM C 582 - 87, 
section 5.2.1 of ASTM C 582 - 87 as "a thin mat of fine  
 
fibers used primarily to produce a smooth surface on a 
reinforced plastic." 5.2.1.2 of ASTM C 582 - 87 states 
that the requirements of acceptable surface veils are: 
"(a) Resin compatibility. (b) Uniform fiber distribution. (c) Single filaments (not bunched) (d) The veil layer(s) shall be a minimum of 
10 mils in dry thickness producing a 10 to 15 mil resin 
saturated veil layer per 10 mils of dry veil, and (e) Minimum fiber length shall be 0.5 in. Note 9--The chemical resistance of the RTP 
laminate is provided by the resin. In combination with 
the cured resin, the surfacing veil helps determine the 
thickness of the resin-rich layer, reduces 
microcracking, and provides a nonwicking chemically 
resistant layer. Additional desirable considerations in 
choosing a veil for a specific application include: 
(a) Drapability (surfacing veil should 
conform to mold shape). (b) Dry and wet tensile strength. (c) Binder solubility (if used) (d) Uniform wetting. (e) Surfacing veil shall wet-out completely 
without trapping air during laminating, and (f) Surfacing veil should not inhibit resin 
cure." The surfacing veil is a reinforcement 
material that when saturated with resin (sometimes 
referred to as "wet out") retains a high resin to 
reinfor
