<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for printing at least one image, with a determined number of copies, using a press, by transfer of a pigment vehicle between an intermediate transfer element obtained by magnetic imaging and a printing medium, comprising at least: a phase of automatic production of the intermediate transfer element in the press by developing, on a substrate, zones each having a different affinity with the pigment vehicle, characterised in that an insulating and hardenable magnetic material is fixed on the substrate in order to constitute these zones having different affinities, the insulating and hardenable magnetic material is cured and subjected to an electrostatic charge by any device capable of charging it at the surface in order to give the regions the affinity with the pigment vehicle; the pigment vehicle having electrostatic properties is deposited on the electrostatically charged parts of cured material and finally the pigment vehicle is transferred onto the printing support by direct contact with the intermediate transfer element.

<CLAIMS>
Method for printing at least one image, with a 
predetermined print run, using a press, by transferring 

a colouring vehicle (9) between an intermediate 
transfer element obtained by magnetic imaging and a 

print carrier (3), comprising at least: a phase of 
automatically producing the intermediate transfer 

element in the press by developing, on a substrate (2), 
zones that each have a different affinity with the 

colouring vehicle, some of which correspond to the 
image to be printed, characterised in that an isolating 

and hardenable material (1) is fixed to the substrate 
(2) in order to constitute these zones with different 

affinities, 

the isolating and hardenable material (1) is hardened 
and subjected to an electrostatic charge by any device 

(16) capable of charging it on the surface in order to 
confer on the zones representing the image the affinity 

with the colouring vehicle (9); 
the colouring vehicle (9) having electrostatic 
properties is deposited on the parts of the hardened 

material (1) that are electrostatically charged and 
finally the transfer of the colouring vehicle (9) to 

the print carrier (3) is effected by direct contact 
with the intermediate transfer element (2, 1). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
comprises a stage of cleaning the transfer element by 

removing the hardenable material when a new image has 
to be printed. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the colouring vehicle (9) is first charged with 

electrostatic charges of opposite polarity to the  
 

charge of the hardenable material (1). 
Method according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that 
the hardenable material (1) is meltable, and the 

predetermined operation of the removal phase consists 
in melting the hardenable material (1) on the substrate 

(2), the substrate having low thermal inertia so that, 
immediately after melting and removal, the substrate 

(2) returns to the temperature it had before this 
phase, permitting the production of a new transfer 

element without delay.

be affected by this attack. 
Method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
substrate (2) cannot be dismantled from the press and 

is constituted so as to have low thermal inertia, so 
that the consequences of an increase in its 

temperature, as a result of chemical attack, are 
quickly diffused in order to allow the almost immediate 

production of a new intermediate transfer element after 
the removal of the hardenable material (1). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterised in that it 
consists in constituting the intermediate transfer 

element by depositing on the substrate (2), which 
cannot be dismantled from the press, a magnetic

the hardenable material (1) from a reservoir (210) and
