ceramic composites having superior erosion and 

corrosion resistance to molten metal. The composite 
includes mullite, aluminum nitride and boron nitride in 

combination. The composite may be hot pressed or cold 
formed and pressureless sintered into a desired shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ceramic composite and 
to a method of making ceramic composites having 
superior erosion and corrosion resistance to molten 
metal. In the continuous casting of molten steel a break 
ring is used to provide a thermal barrier at the 
interface between the furnace nozzle and the mold. The 
break ring must possess thermal shock resistance, 
stability at high temperature and must be corrosion and 
erosion resistant to the high temperature molten steel 
which flows through the break ring into the mold. The 
ability to resist attack from the molten metal passing 
through the break ring as it flows into the extrusion 
mold determines the tonnage of metal that can be cast 
in a single operation without interruption of the 
process to replace the break ring. Cost is another 
important factor which requires the break ring to be 
machinable. Boron nitride is a conventional material used in 
the fabrication of break rings. It is desirable because 
of its good thermal shock resistance, stability at high 
temperature and machinability. However, its lacks good 
abrasion resistance which subjects it to high wear 
rates when exposed to flowing molten metal. Boron 
nitride has also been combined to form a ceramic 
composite with alumina (Al2O3) which is also used in 
molten metal applications due to its hardness, abrasion 
resistance and chemical stability. In addition, boron  
 
nitride has been separately combined with aluminum 
nitride (AlN), titanium diboride(TiB2), mullite(3Al2O3-2SiO2) 
and with aluminum nitride and titanium diboride. 
Other materials have also been combined with boron 
nitride such as silicon nitride to form a composite for 
use as a break ring. However a silicon nitride 
composite is not readily machinable. The boron nitride 
composites BN-AlN, BN-3Al2O3-2SiO2, and BN-TiB2-AlN are 
readily machinable and are commercially available from 
the Praxair Inc., advanced ceramics division, located 
in Cleveland Ohio. The mechanical and physical 
properties of Al2O3-BN and mullite-BN composites are 
described in Lewis et al in "Microstructure and 
Thermomechanical Properties in Alumina and Mullite 
Boron Nitride Particulate Ceramic-Ceramic Composites", 
Ceram. Eng. Sci. Proc. 2: 719-727 (Nos.7-8,1981) which 
also includes data on the thermal shock resistance of 
such composites. In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 4,997,605 
discloses a hot pressed ceramic composite formed from a 
blend of fused zirconia mullite and boron nitride which 
is indicated as having good resistance to thermal
