<ABSTRACT>
A device for cutting physiologic tissue composed of 
a handpiece (2) having an output end, an optical system (12,14) 

carried in the handpiece for conducting laser radiation 
and for emitting the radiation from the output end; and 

a laser optically coupled to the optical system for 
delivering laser radiation to said optical system (12,14). The 

laser is of a size which permits it to be installed in 
the handpiece (2). Ideally, the laser constitutes a source of 

laser radiation at a wavelength substantially between 
2.65 and 2.8µm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of pending 
application Serial Number 08/025,521 filed on March 3, 
1993, and abandoned as of the filing date of the present 
application. The present invention relates to medical and dental 
treatments which involve the use of laser radiation, 
particularly to remove hard tissue, including bone, 
enamel, dentin, cementum, and dental root material, and 
soft tissue, including gum, tooth pulp, and all other 
vascularized physiologic tissue. The use of laser radiation to treat various types of 
biological tissue has been the subject of research over 
several decades. The research has demonstrated the 
ability of laser radiation in various wavelength ranges 
and at various power levels to produce specific effects 
on selected tissues, including cutting of hard and soft 
tissues, sterilization, anesthesia or desensitization, 
hemostasis, etc. A wide variety of laser systems for performing 
medical and dental treatments have been developed or 
proposed. Some of these systems are constituted by a handpiece 
containing a laser, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Numbers 
3,622,743: 4,503,853; 4,826,431; and 5,074,861. In these 
devices, the laser may be a semiconductor laser which can 
produce radiation at a wavelength and power level that do 
not result in tissue removal but can perhaps serve to 
perform sterilization or desensitization operations. Other systems include lasers which operate at power 
levels that enable more substantial operations to be 
performed, such as cutting. By way of example, use has been made of radiation at 
a wavelength of 10.6 µm produced by a CO₂ laser, 1.06 µm 
or 0.532 µm produced by an Nd:YAG laser and 2.94 µm  
 
produced by an Er:YAG laser. A laser of the last-mentioned 
type is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,074,861. It has further been learned that if certain 
procedures requiring relatively high power levels, such 
as cutting hard tissue, are performed with pulsed 
radiation, harmful side effects such as thermal damage to 
adjacent tissue can be minimized, as disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,020,995, which issued to Guy Levy on June 4, 
1991, if the laser radiation pulses are applied to the 
tissue to be cut simultaneously with delivery of a 
cooling medium containing water, and preferably an 
air/water spray. Known lasers capable of generating radiation which 
can effectively cut biologic tissue operate at very low 
energy conversion efficiency levels, which means that 
such a laser must be capable of operating at a very high 
level of pumping power
