<ABSTRACT>
A mask for use in exposure of a semiconductor wafer 
includes transparent portions (2, 31, 51) for transmitting 

light used in the exposure, formed by a transparent layer 
and corresponding to first areas of the wafer, these being 

areas which are to be exposed, opaque portions (14, 32, 53) 
for masking the light, formed by an opaque layer and 

corresponding to second areas of the wafer adjacent to the 
first areas, and phase shift portions (3a, 37A, 37B, 41A, 

41B) for shifting the phase of the light so as to improve 
the contrast between the first and second areas, formed by 

a phase shift layer (3a) formed over the transparent layer 
and the opaque layer. According to the invention, in at 

least one part of the mask the phase shift portions are 
formed only along edges of the opaque portions (14, 32, 53) 

without extending between adjacent opaque portions. A 
method of producing such a mask, and a pattern forming 

method employing the mask, are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
masks, mask producing methods and pattern forming
methods using masks, and more particularly to a mask
which uses a phase shift of light, a mask producing
method for producing such a mask and a pattern forming
method which uses such a mask.When forming patterns of elements, circuits
and the like on a semiconductor wafer in a production
process of a semiconductor device, it is normal to
employ a pattern transfer exposure which uses an
ultraviolet light.The pattern which is to be transferred onto
the wafer is formed depending on the existence of a
metal thin film which is provided on a glass substrate,
where the metal thin film is opaque with respect to the
light and the glass substrate is transparent with
respect to the light. The pattern on the glass
substrate to be transferred onto the wafer is called a
mask when this pattern is identical to a chip pattern
which is actually transferred onto the wafer. On the
other hand, the pattern on the glass substrate is called
an enlarged mask or a reticle when this pattern is
enlarged compared to the chip pattern which is actually
transferred onto the wafer. When using the mask, the
pattern is transferred onto a resist layer on the wafer
and exposed using a parallel ray. On the other hand,
when using the reticle, the pattern is transferred onto
the resist layer on the wafer and exposed using a
reduction lens system which projects a reduced pattern
on the resist layer.In order to improve the resolution of the
pattern which is transferred especially when the 
integration density of the integrated circuit is large
and the pattern is fine, it is necessary to improve the
contrast at an edge portion of the region which is
exposed.FIG.1 shows an example of a conventional mask
which is made up of an opaque layer having a
predetermined pattern and a transparent substrate.
FIG.2 shows an example of an optical system for forming
a pattern on the wafer using the mask shown in FIG.1.In FIG.1, a mask 450 comprises a transparent
substrate 452 and an opaque layer 451 which is made of a
material such as chromium (Cr). The opaque layer 451 is
formed to a predetermined pattern by lithography and
etching processes.In FIG.2, a light C which is emitted by an
exposure apparatus (not shown) illuminates the mask
450. The light C cannot be transmitted through the
opaque layer 451 but is transmitted through a portion of
the transparent substrate 452 not provided with the
opaque layer 451. The transmitted light passes through
an imaging lens system
