<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to iodinated aromatic 
propanedioates which are particularly useful as contrast 
agents for x-ray imaging. X-ray imaging is a well known and extremely 
valuable tool for the early detection and diagnosis of 
various disease states in the human body. The use of 
contrast agents for image enhancement in medical x-ray 
imaging procedures is widespread. An excellent 
background on iodinated and other contrast agents for 
medical imaging is provided by D.P. Swanson et al, 
Pharmaceuticals in Medical Imaging, 1990, MacMillan 
Publishing Company. The following references describe various 
iodine containing compounds useful in preparing x-ray 
contrast compositions. U.S. Patent 3,097,228 describes derivatives 
of 2,4,6-triiodobenzoyloxyalkanoic acids having the 
structure 
 
wherein R1 is H or lower alkyl; R2 is H or lower-alkanoyl; 
and R3 is H or lower alkanoylamino and R4 is 
lower alkyl. U.S. Patent 3,144,479 describes iodinated 
benzoic acid esters having the formula  
 
 
wherein X is an iodine atom or an amino group and R is 
selected from H, alkyl, alkoxyalkyl, i.e.( CH2 )m-O-R'', 
wherein R'' is alkyl and m is 1 or 2, phenyl and a 
particular iodinated aromatic group. However, these references do not disclose or 
suggest compounds featuring an ester group linked to an 
alkanoate group on an iodinated aromatic ring. Published European specification EP-A-0 
498,482 describes nanoparticulate x-ray contrast 
compositions which have proven to be extremely useful 
in medical imaging. However, particulate contrast 
agents in certain in vivo applications can exhibit less 
than fully satisfactory solubility profiles and/or 
enzymatic degradation, e.g. in plasma and blood. It would be desirable to provide compounds 
for use as x-ray contrast agents having improved 
enzymatic degradability and appropriate solubility 
profiles. Novel iodinated aromatic propanedioates have 
now been discovered and prepared which are useful as 
contrast agents in x-ray imaging compositions and 
methods. More specifically, in accordance with this 
invention, there are provided compounds having the 
structure 
wherein (Z)COO is the residue of an 
iodinated aromatic acid; R1 and R2 are independently alkyl, fluoroalkyl, 
cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl; R3 is H, alkyl, fluoroalkyl, cycloalkyl, 
aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy, aryloxy, cyano, sulfonate, 
carboxamido, sulfonamido, CO2-alkyl, CO2-aryl or 
CO2-aralkyl. This invention further provides an x-ray 
contrast composition comprising the above-described 
compound and a
