<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detergent compositions
comprising percarbonate bleach. In particular it relates to
compositions which have a high bulk density, improved
characteristics of dispensing from either the drawer of a
washing machine, or other dispensing device, thereby giving
improved cleaning performance of bleaching compositions.Inorganic perhydrate bleaches, such as perborate,
percarbonate, and persilicate are well-known as detergent
components. Preferably they are combined with peracid
precursors which perhydrolise the perhydrate to form the
active peracid. This perhydrolysis reaction is promoted by
alkaline conditions.Compositions which comprise percarbonate and peroxy
carboxylic acid bleach precursors have been described in
detail in the Applicants co-pending application WO9206163,
published on 16th April, 1992. Compositions which aim to improve dispensing
characteristics of high bulk density detergents have also
been described in the prior art.EP-A-534525, published on 31st March, 1993 describes the use
of particulate citric acid having a specified particle size
in order to aid dispensing. Bleach compounds including
percarbonate are mentioned.
However, use of particulate citric acid does not address
the problem of providing alkaline conditions in the wash
liquor.The use of water-soluble alkaline inorganic salts in the
composition would address this problem.EP-A-229671, published on 22nd July, 1987 proposes the use of
particulate carbonate or phosphonates in specified
detergent compositions. It is claimed that improved
dispersibility and solubility in cold water can be
achieved.The use of sodium silicate as a suitable particulate
water-soluble alkaline inorganic salt is known to
contribute to the inhibition of corrosion of washing
machine drums, and to the rapid removal of heavy metal
colloids from the laundry soil which would otherwise tend
to destabilise the peroxygen and peracid species.Although silicate is sparingly soluble in cold water, and
therefore dry mixed, fine particles of silicate (with a
particle size diameter of less than 425 micrometers) with
high surface area are preferred, it has been observed that
the combination of perborate monohydrate and fine soluble
particles of inorganic salts, including silicate) is
detrimental to the dispensing profile of the product.
Attempts to replace the fine particles of silicate by
coarser silicate, or to replace perborate monohydrate by 
perborate tetrahydrate has been found to lead to poorer
cleaning performance.It has now been found
