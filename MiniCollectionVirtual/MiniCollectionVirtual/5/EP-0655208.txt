<ABSTRACT>
Applicator device for a liquid, including a container (1) and a dispensing dome (9) connected to the said container by a dispensing head (7, 8, 10): the dispensing dome (9) is produced in a porous material; the container is a pressurised reservoir (1) equipped with a dispensing valve (4), the dispensing dome (9) being carried by a support (8) mechanically linked to a connecting piece (13) capable of interacting with the said valve (4) to cause it to open through the action of mechanical stressing exerted on the dispensing dome (9); the liquid ejected outside the reservoir (1) during said opening is channelled through the said connecting piece (13) towards the face (9b) of the dispensing dome (9) which is opposite the outer face (9a) of the said dome (9); the dispensing head includes an attaching member (7) making it possible to secure the said head to the reservoir (1), the attaching member being a rigid skirt (7) fastened on the reservoir (1); a flexible element (10) connects the said attaching member (7) and the support (8), the rigid skirt (7) being connected in the vicinity of its upper border (7a) to a cylindrical wall, which constitutes the flexible element (10); the dispensing head (7, 10, 8) is produced in a single piece by moulding plastic material.

Applicator device for liquid, comprising a
container for the liquid to be applied to a surface to

be treated, and a dispenser head (9) connected to the
said container via a dispenser cap (7, 8, 10), the

dispenser head (9) being made of a porous material
adapted for application of the liquid by simple rubbing

of the outer face (9
a
) of the said head (9) on the
surface to be treated, the container being a

pressurized reservoir (1) equipped with a dispenser
valve (4), the dispenser head (9) being borne by a

support which constitutes an element of the dispenser
cap and is mechanically connected to a joining piece

(13) capable of cooperating with the said valve (4) so
as to bring about its opening under the action of a

mechanical stress exerted on the dispenser head (9),
the liquid discharged from the reservoir (1) during the

said opening being channelled by a channel (14) through
the said joining piece (13) towards that face (9
b
) of
the dispenser head (9) which is opposite the outer face

(9
a
) of the said head (9), the dispenser cap comprising
a fastening member allowing the said cap to be

connected to the reservoir (1), and the fastening
member being a rigid skirt (7) fixed on the reservoir

(1) by snap-fitting of a snap-fitting zone (11),
characterized in that a flexible element (10) connects

the said fastening member and the support of the
dispenser head (9), the rigid skirt (7) being

connected, in the vicinity of its upper edge (7
a
), to a
cylindrical wall which constitutes the flexible element

(10), the dispenser cap (7, 10, 8) being made in one
piece by moulding of plastic material.
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the porous material from which the dispenser head

(9) is made is a sintered material.
Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,
characterized in that the connection between the rigid

skirt (7) and the cylindrical wall which constitutes
the flexible element (10) is effected via a rounded 

zone (10
a
) whose convexity is directed towards the
snap-fitting zone (11).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that the support of the dispenser head

(9) is a dish (8) exhibiting, over at least one zone, a
depression (8
a
) capable of collecting an excess of
liquid discharged via the valve (4).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the support of the dispenser head

(9) comprises at least one fastening means (12) for
holding the dispenser head (9) on the said support.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that an obstacle is arranged opposite

that end of the internal channel (14) of the joining
piece (13) which does not cooperate directly with the

valve (4), in order to act as a jet break.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that substantially radial channels are

formed between the inner face of the support and the
inner face of the dispenser head (9).
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the reservoir (1) is a

cylindrical can whose top is shaped as a nose cone (2)
and carries the dispenser valve (4), a snap-fitting

groove (6) being provided in the connection zone
between the cylindrical wall and the nose cone wall

(2), the rigid skirt (7) being cylindrical and having,
in the vicinity of one of its edges, a snap-fitting

means (11) capable of cooperating with the said snap-fitting
groove (6).
Device according to Claim 8 taken together with
Claim 1, characterized in that the flexible element
