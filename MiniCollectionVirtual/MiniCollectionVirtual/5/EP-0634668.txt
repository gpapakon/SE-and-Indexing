<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radar apparatus having a synthetic aperture based on rotating antennas (ROSAR principle), preferably for helicopters, which operates in the millimetric wave band and is used primarily as an obstacle radar (obstruction radar), the full synthetic aperture length being achievable even at very short ranges, as a result of the antenna arrangement on a capstan. Exemplary embodiments, calculations and illustrations are given and explained.

Radar apparatus with synthetic aperture based on rotary 
antennae for obstacle warning for helicopters, comprising a 

processor for the ROSAR unit which includes a correlator 
(8) for correlation of receive signals with reference 

functions, and a transmitter and a receiver as well as 
antennae for transmitting and receiving radar pulses, and 

the antennae (111) are in a co-rotating manner arranged 
at the end of a rotary arm, for example a helicopter rotor 

or a turnstile (110), above the rotor on the rotary axis 
(102), 
characterised in that
a: for ranges outside a relevant range for obstacle 
warning, for example from 500 m onwards, the 

apparatus carries out signal processing by the 
unfocused method, i.e. correlation with simplified 

reference functions for which purpose a threshold 
value detector is fitted which, on exceeding a specified 

amplitude, automatically switches over to focused 
signal processing; 
b: by varying the size of the range intervals, their number 
is kept low in that these intervals get smaller at close 

range, thus the radial resolution is better than at long 
range; 
c: the transmit/receive units associated with the 
respective antennae (111) perform signal evaluations 

at different frequencies and preferably in the 
millimetre-wave range; and 
d: the principle of the synthetic aperture based on weakly 
focusing antennae (111) is combined with the 

principle of a real aperture where sharply focusing 
antennae are used. 
Radar apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterised in 
that
 an FM/CW radar apparatus is used the linear  
 

modulation of the transmit frequency covers the required 
band width for generating the radial resolution. 
Radar apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised 
in that
 the antennae (111), fitted at the end of the rotary 
arm and generating an arcshaped synthetic aperture, are 

oriented either directly to the radial direction or directly 
towards the ground. 
Radar apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 

characterised in that
 two weakly focusing antennae are 
combined on a common support for the purpose of signal 

processing on the principle of the ROSAR based synthetic 
aperture with two stronger focusing antennae on the 

principle of the real aperture. 
Radar apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 

characterised in that
 the antennae (111) are arranged to 
be oriented in the helicopter flight direction for the purpose 

of obstacle warning and towards the ground for the 
purpose of ground cartography. 
Radar apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 

characterised in that
 the respective transmit/receive 
units associated with respective antennae (111) operate 

for the purpose of signal evaluation at different frequencies 
and are arranged to co-rotate with the rotary arm. 
Radar apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 

characterised in that
 the depression angles from antenna 
(111) to antenna (111) of each arm are variable from 

rotorhead (100) or turnstile (110) for the purpose of 
illumination of staggered circular rings on the ground. 
Radar apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 

characterised in that,
 for the purpose of data rate 
reduction, data pre-processing is carried out prior to signal 

processing and image generation by means of a processor 
circuit on the rotor arm.  

 
Radar apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 

characterised in that
 an electrical or optical coupling unit 
is provided for data transfer from rotor arm into the 

helicopter cockpit 
Radar apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 

characterised in that
 the processor comprises a first 
channel for generating the reference functions and a 

second channel to receive signals reflected on the ground, 
and the first channel includes a geometry module (1) and a 

processor circuit (2) for dividing the illuminated area into 
individual range intervals and a processor module (3) which 

calculates the reference functions for these range intervals 
and delivers them to a memory (4), and the second 

channel includes a quadrature demodulator (5) for the echo 
signals (S
e
) the components (I
e
 and G
e
) of which are fed to 
an A/D converter (6) and from there fed to a memory (7), 

and signals stored in the memories (4, 7) are 
synchronously transferred into a correlator (8) the 

correlation signals of which are delivered for display to a 
monitor (9) and an evaluation unit (10).
