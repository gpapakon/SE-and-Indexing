<ABSTRACT>
A device for exhausting gas or the like, comprises a 
support (2,8) and at least one exhaust tube movably mounted to 

the support and having a frame which is connected to the 
support in a manner pivotable at least in vertical direction. 

The frame is provided with a balancing mechanism for the 
exhaust tube, said balancing mechanism comprising a cable 

with a draw spring (17). The cable is guided between support and 
frame such that there are formed at least two cable portions (18',18'') 

to create two force components producing an opposite variable 
torque around the pivot point of the frame such that the 

balancing torques, counteracting the gravitational torque, are 
produced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for exhausting gas 
or the like, comprising a support, at least one exhaust tube 
movably mounted to the support and having a frame which is 
connected to the support in a manner pivotable at least in 
vertical direction and being provided with a balancing 
mechanism for the exhaustion tube, said balancing mechanism 
comprising a force producing means, comprising at least two 
portions having two force components producing an opposite 
variable torque around the pivot point of the frame such that 
balancing torques, counteracting the gravitational torque, are 
produced, and wherein the force producing means comprise a 
draw spring means and an elongated flexible fastening means 
connected thereto, said elongated flexible fastening means 
being guided around a reversing means fixed to the frame, and 
being mounted with its ends to the support to form cable 
portions. A device of this type is known from DE-A-30 04 392. 
The construction of this known device serves to provide a 
counteracting force when the hood provided at the free end of 
the exhaustion tube is lowered. From WO 93/03867 a device is 
known in which the force producing means cooperate with a 
compensating means formed as a curve along which a cable 
connected to a draw spring runs, which engages the curve in 
different points when the exhaustion tube is in different 
positions. The configuration of the curve is adapted to the 
torque which is required for balancing the gravitational 
torque in certain positions of the exhaustion tube. The object of the invention is to provide a device of 
the type mentioned in the preamble in which the balancing 
mechanism is constructed such that the two opposite balancing 
torques produced in accordance with the invention neutralize 
each other to such extent that a balancing torque remains that 
more or less balances the gravitational torque. To this end, the fastening means of the device 
according to the invention consist of a cable and the 
reversing means of a cable wheel, whereby one end of the cable 
is at a greater distance from the pivot point between the 
frame and support than the other end.  
 Further features of the device according to the 
invention are specified in the subsequent claims. The invention will hereafter be elucidated with 
reference to the drawing very schematically showing a 
plurality of embodiments of the invention by way of example. Fig. 1 is side view, partially sectional, of a device 
for exhausting gas or the like according to the
