<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophoresis
pattern reader.The pattern reader for electrophoresis of the fluorescence
type has the advantage that it does not require
dangerous and expensive radioisotopes.Generally speaking, electrophoresis analysis methods
using fluorescence methods had been used for analysis of
various genetic structures including DNA sequencing
(determination of a sequence of bases of the gene), mass
spectrometry of proteins such as amino acids and analysis
of polymer structures. Such an electrophoresis analysis
method involves implementing electrophoresis using a sample
of fragments labelled with a fluorescent substance and a
distribution pattern developed by electrophoresis is analysed
to thereby analyse the samples.Description will be made of a DNA sequencing
device as a representative example of an electrophoresis 
pattern reader.In the DNA sequencing using the DNA sequencing
device, a sample of a DNA whose structure is determined
is first cut into fragments with a restriction enzyme
by controlling reactivity against a chemical reaction
specific to a site of each a base and labeling them with
a fluorescent substance. The fragments are different in
length from each other and have each a particular base
selected from four kinds of bases labeled at their cut
ends, consisting of adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine
(G) and thymine (T). As the fragmented DNA sample can
be separated by electrophoresis in accordance with the
length of the fragment, each fragment is separated by
means of electrophoresis and radiated with laser light to
excite the fluorescent substance labeled on each of the
fragments. A measurement of the distribution in intensity
of the fluorescence emitted from the fluorescent
substance permits the reading of a sequence of bases,
thereby determining the structure of the DNA.FIG. 12 is a view showing an example of the
distribution of DNA fragments obtained by electrophoresis.
As the distance of migration varies with lengths of DNA
fragments (the difference of their molecular weights),
the fragments having the same molecular weights gather
together as time passes, and in an electrophoresis
pattern 70, as shown in FIG. 12, bands 66 are formed so
as to correspond to the molecular weights of the DNA
fragments. As a whole, the electrophoresis pattern is
provided such that the bands 66 are formed in lanes 71,
72, 73 and 74. It is to be noted herein that, as there is 
the difference in molecular weight by one base or more
among the bases A, G, C and T of the fragments,
