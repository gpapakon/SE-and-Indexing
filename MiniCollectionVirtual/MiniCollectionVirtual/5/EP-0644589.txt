Method for filling at least one via hole in a 
semiconductor layer structure which comprises circuit 

structures, 

in which at least one auxiliary via hole (3), in 
which the surface of a first interconnect (2) connected 

to at least one of the circuit structures is 
exposed, is opened in a first part of a first surface 

of the semiconductor layer structure (1) , 
in which a conductive layer (4) having essentially 
conforming edge coverage is applied over the entire 

area, 
in which an insulating layer (5) is applied to the 
conductive layer (4), the said insulating layer 

having a planarizing effect at least in the region 
of the auxiliary via hole (3) and filling the auxiliary 

via hole (3),

the first interconnect (2) is exposed, is opened in 

a second part of the first surface,

covered with an insulating structure (7), 
in which an auxiliary contact (8) to the conductive 
layer (4) is produced outside the via hole (6) and 

the auxiliary via hole, and 
in which the via hole (6) is filled with metal (9) 
by electrodeposition in an electrolyte, the first 

interconnect (2) being connected as a counter-electrode

conductive layer (4). 
Method according to Claim 1, in which the auxiliary 
contact (8) to the conductive layer (4) is connected 

to earth potential during electrodeposition. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, in which, after 
electrodeposition, the insulating layer (5) and the 

conductive layer (4) are essentially removed by planarizing 
the surface of the semiconductor layer structure (1). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in 
which, before the conductive layer is applied, at least 

one further auxiliary via hole is opened to at least a

Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 

in which the insulating layer (5) is formed from 
photoresist, and 
in which, after the exposure and development of the 
insulating layer (5) formed from photoresist, the 

latter is used as an etching mask for opening the 
via holes by means of an anisotropic dry-etching 

process. 
Method according to Claim 5, in which delacquering 
is carried out at the edge of the semiconductor layer 

structure in order to produce the auxiliary contact (8) 
to the conductive layer (4). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in

CVD deposition or from gold by currentless deposition. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 7, in  
 

which the insulating structure or insulating structures

the deposition of an insulating layer over the entire 
area, with essentially conforming edge coverage, and by 

anisotropic etching of the insulating layer. 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 

in which, to fill further via holes in a second 
surface of the semiconductor layer structure which 

is located opposite the first surface, further 
auxiliary via holes are opened in the second surface,

conforming edge coverage is deposited onto the 

entire area of the second surface,
