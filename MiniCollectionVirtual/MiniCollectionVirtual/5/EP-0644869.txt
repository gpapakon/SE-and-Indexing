<ABSTRACT>
Ion pairs of hypericin and its analogues and derivatives are prepared by acidifying hypericin to its free acid form and reacting with a predetermined quantity of an organic or inorganic base at a pH below about 11.5. The compounds are useful as antiviral therapeutics and antiseptics.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ION PAIRS OF HYPERICIN COMPOUNDS HAVING ANTIVIRALACTIVITYFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to ion pairs of hypericin and their use to inhibit the growth of viruses.BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Hypericin, a constituent of plants of the genusHypericum, has been obtained in pure form from plants (Brockman, et al., Ann. 553:1 (1942)), and has also been totally synthesized, (Brockman, et al, Chem. Ber. 90:2302- 2310 (1957) and Brockman, et al, Chem. Ber. 90:2480-2491 (1957)).The Merck Index. 11th Edition, 4799, 1989, reports that hypericin has the following structure:It further reports that it gives solvated blue-black needles from pyridine + methanolic HC1 dec. 320°; is freely soluble in pyridine and other organic bases yielding cherry-red solutions with red fluorescence; is almost insoluble in most other organic solvents; is solu¬ ble in alkaline aqueous solutions; and is red in solutions below pH 11.5 and is green with red fluorescence in solu¬ tions above pH 11.5.Hypericin, both of plant origin and synthetic, has been found to be a potent inhibitor of a wide spectrum of DNA and RNA containing viruses, and particularly of retroviruses, such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) , 

the presumed causative agent of AIDS and other condi¬ tions.U.S. Patent No. 4,898,891 issued February 6, 1990, discloses antiviral pharmaceutical compositions containing hypericin, pseudohypericin or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and methods for using these compositions to treat viral infections.Meruelo et al, Proc. Na l. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5230- 5234 (1988), and U.S. patent 5,047,435 reported antiretroviral activity of hypericin and pseudohypericin in vitroand i vivo . The authors also reported that these aromatic polycyclic diones also were able to inhibit HIV from infecting individual cells.Halm, Bulletin of Pharmacy. 33:217-218 (1978) and Nozaki, JP 063254, published Oct. 29, 1984, disclose the extraction and use of an antiviral agent from Hypericum sp.U.S. Patent No. 5,149,718, issued September 22, 1992, describes compositions and methods for inactivating viruses and retroviruses present in blood, other body fluids and, more generally, biological fluids. The compo¬ sitions include the antiviral compounds hypericin, pseudohypericin, derivatives, analogs, isomers, homologs, salts and mixtures thereof. PCT patent publications WO 89/09055 and 89/09056 disclose compositions for treating retroviral infections with hypericin, pseudohypericin, salts and mixtures with nucleoside analogues, such as
