<ABSTRACT>
An improved carrier for a developer for use in an electrophotographic 
recording apparatus is composed of iron particles having non-spherical shapes 

and an average size of 10 to 50 µm, and a resin layer formed on the surface of 
the iron particles. In a method of producing a visual toner image, a developer 

containing the above carrier is employed and a magnetic brush of the developer 
functions to develop an electrostatic latent image and to clean residual toner 

simultaneously. The toner image obtained exhibits high toner density and high 
image quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrier for a
developer and a method of electrophotographically producing a
visual toner image by using the developer containing such a
carrier. More particularly, the present invention relates to an
improved carrier serving as a constituent of a developer and
having particular shape and size, and a method of
electrophotographically forming a visual toner image using the
developer containing such a carrier, thereby obtaining a toner
image with a high density and a high quality and achieving a
compactness of apparatus.In conventional electrophotographic recording
apparatus such as printers, facsimiles, etc., it is known that a
visual toner image is produced by the successive steps of (1)
forming an electrostatic latent image corresponding to original
image or information data, for instance, on a cylindrical image-bearing
member, (2) magnetically attracting a magnetic
developer on a rotatable developing roll equipped with an inner
permanent magnet and disposed opposing the image-bearing
member, (3) delivering the magnetic developer, while forming a
magnetic brush, to a developing zone where the electrostatic
latent image on the image-bearing member is slidingly brushed
with the magnetic brush. The developed image is then
transferred to a recording sheet and fixed thereon by heating. After transferring the toner image to the recording
sheet, a small amount of the toner is likely to remain on a
photosensitive drum as an image-bearing member in such an
electrophotographic recording apparatus. Thus, a cleaning
device is generally provided to remove the residual toner from
the image-bearing member. To this end, a space for installing
the cleaning device must be provided in the vicinity of the
image-bearing member, failing to achieve an intended
compactness of the electrophotographic recording apparatus.To accomplish the compactness of an
electrophotographic recording apparatus, there has been
proposed that the cleaning device is replaced by a so-called
developing-cleaning unit having developing and cleaning
functions to remove a residual toner from the image-bearing
member (Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 4-86878). In the
electrophotographic recording apparatus equipped with such a
developing-cleaning unit, a magnetic developer containing a
toner and a spherical magnetic carrier is employed. However, in
the case of using such a magnetic carrier of a spherical shape, a
relatively small specific surface area of the magnetic carrier
leads to a small contact area of the carrier and

A carrier for a developer of an electrophotographic recording
apparatus, comprising iron particles of non-spherical

shapes and a resin layer formed on the surface of the iron
particles,
characterised
 in that

the iron particles have an average size of 10 to 50 µm
and those which have particle sizes of less than 10 µm constitute

0.01 to 60 weight-% of the carrier, and
the resin layer formed on the surface of said iron particles
is a uniform insulating resin layer.
The carrier of claim 1, wherein said resin layer is made
of a styrene-acrylic resin, a silicone resin, an epoxy resin,

a styrene-butadiene resin or a cellulose resin.
A method of forming electrophotographically an image on
a recording sheet (P) by use of an image-bearing member (3)

moving with respect to a development zone, comprising the
following steps:


(a) charging a surface of the image-bearing member (3)
uniformly upstream of the development zone,
(b) forming a latent electrostatic image on the image
bearing member (3),
(c) developing the latent electrostatic image to generate
a toner image, by sliding contact of the 

image bearing member (3) in the development zone
with a magnetic brush (23) formed by a developer

including a toner and a carrier, said carrier comprising
iron particles having non-spherical shapes

sheet (P),

wherein residual toner remaining on the image-bearing member

brush (23) simultaneously with the development of a
latent electrostatic image in the developing step (c).

the entire width of the image bearing member (3) upstream the

development zone and downstream the region where the toner
image is transferred to the recording sheet (P).

toner is also removed through discharge means (26, 27) made 

of a conductive material and provided upstream the development
zone.
