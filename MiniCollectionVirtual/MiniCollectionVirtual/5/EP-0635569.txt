<ABSTRACT>
A non-aqueous liquid cleaning composition comprising a 
non-aqueous phase with dispersed particles comprising a 

carrier material and dye material associated thereto 
wherein the carrier-dye particles have a certain D(3,2) 

particle size; a method for preparing the carrier-dye 
particles; and method for preparing the non-aqueous liquid 

with carrier-dye particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to substantially non-aqueous
liquid cleaning products, especially detergent compositions
and to a method of preparing such non-aqueous liquid
cleaning products. Non-aqueous liquid cleaning products are
those containing little or no water.Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions are known in the
art and have been described in quite a number of patent
publications, e.g. in US-A-4,316,812, US-A-4,874,537 and
EP-A-0,484,095. Generally, the free water content of non-aqueous
liquid detergent products is less than 5% by
weight, preferably less than 3% by weight, more preferably
less than 2% by weight, most preferably substantially nil.
Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions provide a way of
concentrating liquid detergents without giving in on
washing performance.Non-aqueous liquid detergent compositions normally comprise
a non-aqueous liquid phase having incorporated therein as
dispersion, solution or combination thereof, the usual
detergent components and adjuncts depending on the purpose
of use, primarily surfactants and builders.The liquid phase often comprises a nonionic surfactant as
major component, which apart from acting as carrier liquid
for the other detergent components, usually and preferably
also has detergent-active properties, thereby acting wholly
or in part as the surfactant ingredient. Adjuncts such as dyes are important ingredients
incorporated in products, usually in small amounts to
provide for certain desired properties. Dye may be included
in non-aqueous liquids to improve the product appearance,
as a warning to consumers for toxic ingredients and/or to
mask consumer-disliked colours of detergent ingredients.GB-A-1,303,810 discloses clear liquid detergent
compositions with a transparent aqueous or non-aqueous base
comprising particles that are visually distinct and have a
diameter size of at least 0.5 mm. The formulation of these
liquids is restricted as they must have a transparent
liquid base and the suspending power of the liquid must be
sufficiently high in order to stably suspend the particles
with the large particle size, which may cause the product
to have a high viscosity.GB-A-2,194,793 discloses liquid detergent compositions
having an aqueous base that comprise high electrolyte
levels and suspended particles having a particle size of
from 1 to 2000 µm, preferably up to 300µm. The aqueous
liquids are prepared to have a mottled or speckled
coloration appearance by using a pigment material and a
carrier material for the suspended particles that

<CLAIMS>
A non-aqueous liquid cleaning composition comprising a non-aqueous liquid phase with dispersed
particles comprising a carrier material characterised in that the particles have a

D(3,2) particle size of from 50µm to less than 500µm, and comprise dye material associated to the carrier material
and do not comprise fluorescer.
Composition according to claim 1, wherein the volume fraction of dispersed particles in the non-aqueous
phase is from 0.1 to 5.0% V/V.
Composition according to claims 1-2, wherein the difference between the L, A and/or B colour intensity
value of the dispersed particles with carrier and dye material and the value of the non-aqueous base is

higher than 10 and/or lower than -10.
Composition according to claims 1-3, wherein the dispersed particles comprising the carrier material
and dye material have density of from 0.1 to 1.5 g/ml.
Composition according to claims 1-4, wherein the carrier material comprises a biopolymer material.
Composition according to claims 1-5, wherein the dispersed particle of carrier material and dye material
is present in amounts of from 0.01 to 80% by weight of the composition.
Composition according to claims 1-6, wherein 0.0001 to 5% by weight of the dispersed particle of dye
material is present.
Composition according to claims 1-7, wherein the composition further comprises a bleach system.
Method of preparing a non-aqueous liquid cleaning composition according to claims 1-8, said method
comprising dispersing of particles comprising carrier material and dye material associated thereto, in

the non-aqueous phase.
Method of preparing a particle, comprising carrier material and dye material being characterised by associated thereto, and
suitable for use in a non-aqueous liquid cleaning composition, said method comprising dissolving of

biopolymer material in water, evaporating the water to an amount of lower than 15% by weight of the
resulting material and before, during or after the evaporation step, adding of dye material, with the

proviso that the particle does not comprise fluorescer.
