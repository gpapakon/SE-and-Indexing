<ABSTRACT>
An adhesion material (30) and oxide layer (28) are deposited 
on the top layer of the die pad (26) of a semiconductor package 

(12) to attach a semiconductor die (32) to a die pad of the 
package. An oxide layer (28) is deposited on top of the die pad. 

The oxide layer can be a chemically grown cuprous oxide. A die 
attach adhesive (30) such as a polymer material is deposited on 

top of the oxide layer, and the semiconductor die is attached to 
the die pad with the die attach adhesive. The oxide layer provides 

superior attachment of the semiconductor die to the die pad and 
prevents delamination of the semiconductor die from the die pad.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to semiconductor 
packaging and, more particularly, to attaching a semiconductor die to 
a die pad. Recent improvements in design and manufacture of 
semiconductor devices involve using transistors with extremely 
small geometries to achieve very high density circuit designs, 
sometimes called Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI). The previous 
generation of semiconductor circuits is known as Very Large Scale 
Integration (VLSI). ULSI circuits are commonly used in computers 
and communication equipment and may have a much greater number 
of input/output pins and superior electrical performance than VSLI 
circuits. In order to assemble the semiconductor circuits for use in the 
computer or communications device, the semiconductor dies are 
attached to an integrated circuit (IC) package, and the IC packages 
are mounted on a printed circuit board. The process of mounting of 
the semiconductor die to a package must fulfill several requirements 
including good electrical conduction between the die leads and 
package leads, good heat conduction to dissipate the heat generated 
by the semiconductor die, and good attachment of the IC die to the 
die pad of the package. Plastic ball grid array packages, also known as over-molded 
pad array carrier (OMPAC) are a low cost, high density packaging 
solution for advanced ULSI circuits. Building the OMPAC package 
typically involves attaching a semiconductor die using organic die 
attach material to a die pad made of gold-plated copper patterned 
on the printed circuit board. After attaching the semiconductor 
die to the gold-plated die pad, the package is wire bonded and 
over-molded with an epoxy based encapsulation. Gold plating 
works well for wire bond pads because it is a good electrical and 
heat conductor for metal-to-metal unions. The back side of the 
OMPAC package is attached with solder balls for signal  
 
transmission and heat dissipation. The OMPAC package is in turn 
attached to the printed circuit board, commonly known as the 
mother board, at the end user site using a reflow solder process 
such as IR, vapor phase or wave solder at temperatures typically 
between 215°C-260°C. Unfortunately, the gold-plated copper has poor adhesive 
properties to most organic materials, including die attach 
material and encapsulants. The OMPAC packages comprise many 
organic materials. For example, the printed circuit board in the 
OMPAC package may be made of a bismaleimide triazine-epoxy 
composite commonly termed BT. Other
