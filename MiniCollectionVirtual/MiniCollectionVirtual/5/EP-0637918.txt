<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of treating substrates for the purpose of reducing the population of contaminant organisms associated with them; particularly to treatment of foodstuffs, propagative materials and items intended for use in veterinary and medical applications. The method directs laser radiation at the substrate whereby the type and amount of laser radiation are selected such as to render organisms associated with the substrate inviable while leaving the desired properties of the substrate itself substantially unchanged. Apparatus suitable for treating a variety of substrates are disclosed, with a source of laser radiation (9, 28) and means (26, 27, 29) for handling the substrate (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
 SURFACE STERILISATION BY LASER TREATMENTThe present invention relates to a method of treating substrates for the purpose of reducing the population of contaminant organisms associated with them; particularly to treatment of foodstuffs, propagation materials and items for veterinary and medical end uses.Extensive fungicidal and pesticidal treatment of plant materials, eg. fruit, vegetables and grains, is presently carried out for the purpose of precluding unwanted contamination. The treatment is often environmentally undesirable, potentially hazardous to the consumer of the product and is somewhat inefficient in eradicating certain parasitic growth, particularly of fungi. Similarly many animal products must be treated prior to sale to reduce the numbers of contaminating microorganisms to an acceptable level for the intended final use. For example eggs and poultry products are often dipped in bactericidal solutions for eliminating bacteria such as salmonella and listeria.Further to these chemical treatments, physical sterilization treatment are routinely applied to products for use in consumer, veterinary or medical applications. For example, sterilization using microwaves has been applied to treatment of mushroom casing, while high pressure steam treatment forms the basis for treatment of medical instruments in autoclaves. These treatments are all potentially hazardous and/or require significant amounts of time to achieve optimal effect. Furthermore where the end product is a foodstuff or chemical entity its structure may be altered to the detriment of desirable qualities such as flavour, texture, efficacy and, eg for seeds, viability.US 3817703 uses high powered lasers to sterilise laser transmitting liquids, wherein the power denisty used is at least 105 Watts cm"2 and is preferably 108-1010 Watts cm"2. Such method is applicable to light transparent materials such as wines, but is completely inappropriateSUBSTITUTE SHEET 

for application to materials which are light absorbent, particularly those substantially opaque to laser light or which absorb it in part.The present inventors have now provided a novel method capable of being applied to all the above substrates and others, whereby contaminant organisms are rendered inviable in short time without the disadvantages of the aforesaid methods and without affecting the desired qualities of the end product or leaving environmentally or physiologically damaging residues thereon. Furthermore, in certain applications, such as in the inhibition of some

CLAIMS .
1. A method of treating a substrate substantially opaque to laser radiation or unable to transmit laser radiation without absorbing substantial amounts thereof, for the purpose of reducing levels of contaminating organisms associated with its surface, comprising directing laser radiation at the substrate, such that the type and amount of laser radiation are selected to render organisms on the substrate surface inviable while leaving the desired properties of the substrate itself substantially unchanged.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the substrate is a consumable and/or propagative material and the contaminating organisms are microorganisms.
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the substrate and laser radiation are moved relative to each other such as to ensure that a substantial proportion of the substrate surface is exposed to the radiation.
4. A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein the relative movement of the substrate involves turning of the substrate relative to the laser radiation.
5. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the laser radiation is provided by an infra-red laser source.
6. A method as claimed in claim 5 wherein the laser source is capable of generating laser radiation at a power output of about 10 to 20 Watts.
7- A method as claimed in any one of the preceding claims wherein the laser source is operated in continuous wave mode.
