<ABSTRACT>
Prefabricated components (1) are disclosed for a wall in the ground made up of prefabricated and one-piece sections. The 
said prefabricated components consist of a reinforcing shell and a concrete body with longitudinal concave grooves (2) along 

abutting faces, the grooves being displaced towards one of the longitudinal faces of the body, an arrangement which creates 
jutting limbs of greater (3) and lesser (4) width. The reinforcing shell consists of an outer laminated reinforcement (6), 

transverse rods (7) and intersecting rods (5), the latter being rigidly connected to the laminated reinforcement (6) and the 
transverse rods (7). The transverse rods (7) and laminated reinforcement (6) can be provided with protruding sections (9, 10, 

11). The sectional wall in the ground constructed using the above-mentioned prefabricated components (1) is provided with 
continuous transverse reinforcement on the side opposite to the laminated reinforcement (6). A method of erecting the 

sectional wall involves creating a trench with recesses, setting up the prefabricatded components (1) with protruding sections 
(9, 10) and components without protruding sections in the recesses by a specified method and concreting the solid wall sections 

between adjacent prefabricated components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prefabricated member of a
sectional monolithic wall, a sectional monolithic wall and a method for erecting a
sectional
monolithic wall in ground.Known in the prior art is a method for erecting
a wall in ground involving digging a trench and concreting
it (see L.V. Makovsky "Urban Underground
Transport Structures", 1979, Stroyizdat (Moscow)
p.330).Also known is a prefabricated member of the sectional
monolithic wall in ground, comprised of a reinforcing
cage and a concrete body provided with longitudinal
curvilinear slots on end faces (see A.L. Filatov
"Erection of Structures by the "wall-in-ground"
method", 1976, Budivelnik, (Kiev), p. 143). The wall
built up of these prefabricated members is devoid of
continuous cross reinforcement which affects adversely
the reliability of the wall, i.e. reduces its
lateral stiffness and calls for complicated work if
waterproofing in watery ground is required.The same source gives a description of a sectional
monolithic wall in ground comprising prefabricated
members having curvilinear longitudinal slots on end
faces and concreted monolithic sections of the wall
disposed between pairs of adjacent prefabricated members.
The method for erecting such a sectional monolithic
wall in ground involves digging a trench by 
a number of digging runs, installing prefabricated
members with curvilinear slots on counteropposing
sides at a distance from one another within each digging
run and concreting the monolithic portions of
the wall between the pairs of adjacent prefabricated
members.The main object of the present invention resides
in improving the reliability of the wall by allowing
it to take lateral bending moments and simplifying
the manufacture of both prefabricated members proper
and the entire wall.This object is attained by the claimed design
of the prefabricated members which go to make a sectional
monolithic wall in ground, and by the claimed
method for erection of said wall.A specific design feature of the prefabricated
member of a sectional monolithic wall in ground, consisting
of a reinforcing cage and a concrete body
with longitudinal curvilinear slots on both end faces, lies
in that said longitudinal curvilinear slots are offset
towards one of the longitudinal sides of the concrete
body and form thicker and thinner projections on each end surface,
said reinforcing cage consists of external
sheet reinforcement disposed on the external
surface of the longitudinal side of the tiers of body
at the side of the thinner projections,
