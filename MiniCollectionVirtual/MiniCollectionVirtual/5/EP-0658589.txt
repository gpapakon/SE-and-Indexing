<ABSTRACT>
An article made from at least one network of 
high strength fibers and a matrix composition that 

includes a vinyl ester and diallyl phthalate. 
Preferably, the article is made from at least one prepreg 

element which includes at least two adjacent layers of 
the high strength fiber network in the vinyl ester-containing 

matrix composition. The prepreg element is 
made by applying a mixture of vinyl ester, diallyl 

phthalate and a carbon-carbon saturated solvent to the 
high strength fiber network.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite,
particularly one that can be used in ballistic resistant
articles, which includes a network of high strength
fibers in a vinyl matrix material.Various constructions are known for ballistic
resistant composites used in ballistic resistant articles
such as helmets, panels, and vests. These composites
display varying degrees of resistance to penetration by
high speed impact from projectiles such as BB's, bullets,
shells, shrapnel, glass fragments and the like. U.S.

4,501,856; 4,457,985; and 4,403,012 and PCT Publication
No. WO 91/12136 describe ballistic resistant composites
which include high strength fibers made from materials
such as extended chain ultra-high molecular weight
polyethylene.Typically these fibers are coated, embedded or
impregnated in a polymeric matrix material. During
production of such composites the matrix materials must
be dissolved in a solvent so that they are in a liquid
form for application to the high strength fibers. The
solvent then must be removed, usually by drying, in order
to fabricate the composite.Of particular interest among the above
disclosures is the description of the materials that can
be used for the matrix material that is found in PCT
Publication No. WO 91/12136; column 14, lines 12-36, of
U.S. Patent No. 5,167,876; column 12, lines 25-39 of U.S. 
Patent No 4,820,569; and column 3, lines 1-5 and Example
1 of U.S. Patent No. 5,165,989. These disclosures
describe the use of a vinyl ester as the matrix material.
This vinyl ester matrix material is the condensation
product of epoxide resins and unsaturated acids that is
diluted in a compound having double bond unsaturation such
as a vinyl aromatic monomer as for example styrene,
vinyl toluene and diallyl phthalate. A problem with
these vinyl ester matrix materials is that the required
unsaturated solvents have a high boiling point, thus
necessitating more energy and time for removal of the
solvent. A further problem with many of the organic
solvents is that they require strict handling and
disposal procedures because of potential environmental or
health hazards.A need exists, therefore, for vinyl ester
matrix materials which do not require such troublesome
solvents, but which provide adequate levels
