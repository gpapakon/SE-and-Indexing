<ABSTRACT>
A fuzzy inference engine has a plurality of 
individual inference sections (10) and a concluder 

section (110) for integrally processing outputs from the 
inference sections. In order for the inference sections 

to share membership function circuits and membership 
function generator circuits, these circuits are arranged 

in arrays disposed at location external with respect to 
the inference sections, which selectively use outputs 

from membership function cirucit arrays (11, 12, 13) and 
the membership function generator circuit array (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuzzy 
inference apparatus for conducting a fuzzy inference and 
to a function generating unit to be employed, 
for example, in a membership function circuit or a membership 
function generator of a fuzzy inference apparatus. An fuzzy inperence is achieved in accordance 
with rules in the form of If ... then ... (modus 
ponens). The rule is represented in a format "If x is A 
and y is B and z is C, then w is D." In this representation, x, y, and z are input 
variables of an antecedent, A, B, and C are membership 
functions thereof, w is a variable of a consequent, and D 
is a membership function thereof. In the example above, the antecedent includes 
three kinds of input variables. In a case of two kinds 
thereof, the rule is expressed as follows. "If x is A and y is B, then z is C." Namely, x 
and y are input variables of an antecedent, A and B are 
membership functions thereof, z is a variable of a 
consequent, and C is a membership function thereof in  
 
this representation. The membership functions such as A to D are 
represented, for example, with linguistic information 
associated with PL, PM, PS, ZR, NS, NM, NL, etc. In 
thses information items, P, N, L, M, and S denote 
positive, negative, large, medium, and small, 
respectively. In consequence, expressions PL and NS 
stand for positive large and negative small, 
respectively. ZR indicates almost zero. The linguistic 
information may be expressed, for example, with binary 
codes each comprising a plurality of bits. FIG. 1 shows a conventional fuzzy inference 
apparatus, which includes a plurality (assocaited with a 
number of rules to be established) of individual 
inference sections or engines 100 and an integrator 
section 110 connected thereto. Each inference section 
100 comprises membership function circuits (to be 
abbreviated as MFC herebelow) 101, 102, and 103 each 
being supplied with an input variable to produce a signal 
(e.g. a voltage signal) representing an associated value 
of a membership of an antecedent, a membership function 
generator (to be abbreviated as MFG herebelow) 105 for 
generating a signal representing a membership function of a 
consequent (e.g. a voltage signal distributed onto 25 
lines, which transmit the voltage distribution and which 
are represented by a hatched bus in FIG.1; reference is  
 
to be made to the U.S. Patent Application Serial 
No.07/116,777 and the European Patent Application No. 87 
116 529.6.), a logic intersection circuit 104 for 
conducting an MIN
