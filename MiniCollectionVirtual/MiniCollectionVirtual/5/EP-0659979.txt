<ABSTRACT>
There is described a turbomachine blade (vane) 2, the front part 11 and rear part 12 of which are hinged together about an axis of pivoting 14, the said blade 2 also including a joint 15 between the said front part 11 and the said rear part 12, the said joint 15 consisting of bringing the ends of these two parts 11 and 12 together, the said joint 15 ensuring continuity of the pressure face 8 and of the suction face 9, as well as sealing between these two surfaces. This blade is noteworthy in that the axis of pivoting 14 is offset on the pressure face side 8 with respect to the mean surface 10, and in that the space 25 which appears on the pressure face side 8 when the blade is cambered, is concealed by a cover 26. Application to turbomachines having a wide operating range, such as aircraft jet engines.

Variable-camber turbomachine blade, the said
blade (2), of thickness e, having a pressure face (8) and

a suction face (9) on each side of and at an equal
distance from a mean surface (10), the said blade (2)

also having a front part (11) and a rear part (12) which
are pivoted one with respect to the other about a

geometrical pivot axis (14), the said blade (2) also
having a junction (15) between the front part (11) and

the rear part (12), the said junction (15) consisting of
the proximity of the surfaces (16) and (19) constituting

respectively those ends of the front part (11) and of the
rear part (12) which face each other, the surface (16) at

the end of the front part (11) being concave and having
the shape of a portion of a surface of revolution centred

on the geometrical pivot axis (14), the surface (19) at
the end of the rear part (12) itself being convex,

characterized in that the geometrical pivot axis (14) is
shifted towards the pressure face (8) with respect to the

mean surface (10) by a distance (d) which is greater than
or equal to one quarter of the thickness (e).
Turbomachine blade according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the geometrical pivot axis (14) is

shifted in the direction of the suction face (8) with
respect to the mean surface (10) by a distance (d) which

is greater than or equal to one third of the thickness
(e).
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the space (25) which

is formed on the pressure face (8) when the blade (2) is 
in a cambered position is masked by a cover (26).
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
Claim 3, characterized in that the cover (26) is fastened

by one end to the front part (11), while its other end
(29) is free.
Variable-camber turbomachine blade according to
Claim 3 or 4, characterized in that the cover (26) has an

external surface (27) in the extension of the surface
(8A) constituting the pressure face (8) of the front part

(11).
Turbomachine blade according to any one of Claims
1 to 5, characterized in that the surface (19) at the end

of the rear part (12) joins onto the surface (9B) forming
the pressure face (9) of the rear part (12) with a radius

of curvature which tends progressively towards the radius
of curvature of the said surface (9B).
