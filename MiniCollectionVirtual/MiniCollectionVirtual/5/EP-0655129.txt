<ABSTRACT>
A spectrometer using flexible variable filters provides a compact and portable system without sacrificing accuracy or range. The flexible variable filters are mounted within the circumference of a cylinder. By using cylinders to mount the flexible variable filters, a simple focussing system is possible. The spectrometer is configurable to scan a variety of ranges by simply changing the filter cylinders, or by adding additional filter cylinders.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to spectrometers, and more specifically 
relates to spectrometers having a flexible filter mounted within a rotating 
cylinder. Older spectrometer designs use prisms or gratings as the spectral 
dispersing elements. These designs are compromised by the mechanical 
sensitivity of the dispersing element. To minimize this sensitivity, the mass 
and size of the spectrometer is increased, adversely impacting the portability 
of the design. Another type of spectrometer, the interferometer, has problems 
due to the requirement of precision moving parts, severe signal processing 
constraints, and non-simultaneous wavelength measurement. Designs using variable filters are relatively new. Variable filters are 
coated with a sequence of high index and low index of refraction layers. The 
coatings vary linearly along the length or circumference of the filter. They are 
typically more compact in design, increasing portability. Two main filter 
shapes are currently used, circular and linear. Circular variable wedge filters 
(i.e. disk-like filters) are wasteful because they needlessly coat area which is 
not used in the final filter. This needlessly wastes material and increases the 
cost of the system. Linear variable wedge filters are more efficient in their use 
of coating area. Yet systems employing either of these filter designs are 
limited in the filter's available range and the accuracy of the actuator that 
moves the filter relative to the incident light beam. The present invention overcomes the shortcomings of previous designs by 
using a novel physical layout for the variable filters. A unique property of the 
invention is the use of rectangular variable filters which flex into an arcuate 
shape. One or more filters may then be mounted within the circumference of 
a cylinder. Cylindrically mounted filters allow the use of simple fixed focusing 
optics. In using this layout, the invention can achieve a fast and accurate 
scan, while retaining a wide scanning range in a small package.  
 US-A-4,082,464 discloses an optical analysis system 
having rotating filters in which six interference filters 
are mounted on a wheel on a cylindrical locus. The wheel 
rotates to move the filters in sequence through a beam of 
light and to vary the angle of incidence of the light to 
the filters as the filters move through the beam of light 
so that the wavelength passed by the filters is swept 
through a range of values. The intensity of light 
reflected from or transmitted through a test
