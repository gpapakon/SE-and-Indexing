<ABSTRACT>
The substitution of the L-Pro at the 7-position with D-Phe or D-Tic and substitution of the L-Phe at the 8-position with hydroxyproline ethers and thioethers of the peptide hormone bradykinin and other additional substituted analogs of bradykinin converts bradykinin agonists into bradykinin antagonists. The invention further includes additional modifications at other positions within the novel 7- and 8-position modified bradykinin antagonists, which increase enzyme resistance, antagonist potency, and/or specificity of the new bradykinin antagonists. The analogs produced are useful in treating conditions and diseases of a mammal and human in which an excess of bradykinin or related kinins are produced or injected as by insect bites.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds which are
bradykinin receptor antagonists, pharmaceutical compositions
and methods for using these compounds to antagonize the
effects of bradykinin in mammals, including humans. More
particularly, the invention relates to the substitution of
the L-Pro at position 7 with D-Phe or D-Tic and substitution
of the L-Phe at position 8 with hydroxyproline ether or
thioether compounds and its L-configuration intermediate
product which convert bradykinin agonists into antagonists
and also includes additional modifications at other
positions within the 7- and 8-position modified bradykinin
antagonist which confer increased antagonist potency,
resistance to enzymatic degradation and/or tissue
specificity on the D-amino acid-containing bradykinin
sequence.Bradykinin (BK) is a nonapeptide generated as a result
of the activity of kallikreins, a group of proteolytic
enzymes present in most tissues and body fluids, on
kininogens. Once released, kinins produce many
physiological responses, including pain and hyperanalgesia
by stimulating C- and A-fibers in the periphery. There is
also considerable evidence that kinins contribute to the
inflammatory response. Bradykinin, and its physiologically important related
peptides kallidin (Lys-bradykinin) and Met-Lys-bradykinin,
exhibit physiological actions which qualify them as
mediators of inflammatory reactions, hypotensive states, and
pain. Bradykinin is overproduced in pathological conditions
such as septic shock, anaphylaxis, rhinitis, asthma,
inflammatory bowel disease, and certain other conditions
including acute pancreatitis, post-gastrectomy dumping
syndrome, carcinoid syndrome, migraine, and angioneurotic
edema. The production of bradykinin from the plasma results
in pain at the site of the pathological condition, and the
overproduction intensifies the pain directly or via
bradykinin-induced activation of the arachidonic acid
pathway which produces prostaglandins and leukotrienes, the
more distal and actual mediators of inflammation.In addition to its analgesic and proinflammatory
effects, bradykinin is a vasodilator. Because of its
ability to lower blood pressure, bradykinin has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of several shock syndromes,
particularly septic or endotoxic shock. Bradykinin is also
a potent bronchoconstrictor in animals and asthmatic
subjects and it has been implicated as a contributor to the
pathogenesis of airway inflammatory conditions such as
allergic asthma and rhinitis. Thus a bradykinin inhibitor or
