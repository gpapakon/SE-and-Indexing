<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel azole derivative, a 
process for the production thereof, and a pharmaceutical 
composition containing the azole derivative as an active ingredient 
(more particularly, an antifungal agent or an aromatase inhibitor). The recent development of pharmaceuticals and the advancement 
of medical techniques conquered many diseases. On the other hand, 
such treatment caused the depression in the immune systems. The 
depression became a major cause of the increase in patients 
susceptible to infection. These patients suffered at a high rate 
from deep-seated fungal diseases of opportunistic infections such 
as candidiasis, aspergillosis, and cryptococcosis. The measure to 
solve the problem became serious. Therefore, active research has 
been under way to develop drugs more superior than the conventional 
antifungal agents. For example, Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) No. 3-187464 discloses an azole derivative 
having a cyclohexanol ring and azole ring as basic structures. 
Such antifungal agents exhibit an antifungal activity by 
functioning on the cytochrome p450 in the fungus and inhibiting the 
production of ergosterol which is a constituent element of cell 
walls. Further, it is known that because the above antifungal 
agents function on the cytochrome p450, some of them exhibit an 
activity to inhibit aromatase [J. Med. Chem., 33 (11), 2933-2942 
(1990)]. From the results of the research on azole derivatives having 
applicability to broader fields and exhibiting a more superior 
antimicrobial activity, the inventors of the present invention 
found a novel azole derivative which has a low toxicity, and which 
exhibits activity against many fungi, and activity to inhibit an 
aromatase. The present invention is based on the above findings.  Therefore, the present invention relates to a compound of the 
general formula (I): 
wherein R₁ and R₂ are, independently from each other, a hydrogen 
atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, X₁ and X₂ are, 
independently from each other, a hydrogen or halogen atom, or 
hydroxyl, cyano or trifluoromethyl group, and Y is CH or a nitrogen 
atom, or a salt thereof. In the above general formula (I), 
preferably, R₁ and R₂ are, independently from each other, a 
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 2 carbon atoms, X₁ and 
X₂ are, independently from each other, a hydrogen or halogen atom, 
or hydroxyl group, and Y is CH or a nitrogen atom. Further, the present invention relates to a compound of the 
general
