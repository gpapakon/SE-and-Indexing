<ABSTRACT>
A double feeder is specified for angular diversity for the illumination of a parabolic antenna reflector, which double feeder is composed of two tubular components (1) which are arranged closely alongside one another and parallel to one another and whose axes run parallel to the centre axis of the reflector. At least one waveguide (6, 7), for carrying a linear-polarized electromagnetic wave, is in each case connected to the tubular components (1). The ends of said waveguides facing the reflector are open, while their ends facing away from the reflector are closed. A tubular piece (3), which has the same cross-sectional shape but smaller unobstructed dimensions than the components (1), is integrally formed on each of the two tubular components (1), on the side facing the reflector, with a continuous transition (2) being interposed. The two tubular pieces (3) are in each case arranged with the same axis direction as the components (1) but eccentrically with respect to them, in such a manner that they are located directly alongside one another in a plane and are thus as close as possible to one another. Dielectric material is arranged in the two tubular pieces (3).

<CLAIMS>
Double exciter for angle diversity to illuminate the
parabolic reflector of an antenna, consisting of two

tubular members disposed in proximity to one another and
parallel to one another, the axes of which run parallel to

the centre axis of the reflector, to each of which at
least one hollow conductor for conducting a linear

polarised electromagnetic wave is attached, having the
sides directed towards the reflector open, while the sides

facing away from the reflector are closed, 
characterised
in that
a tubular component (3) having the same cross-sectional
shape but smaller internal dimensions than

the member (1) is integrally formed on each of the two
tubular members (1) on the side towards the reflector

with an intervening continuous transition (2),
the two tubular components (3) are disposed in the
same axial direction as the member (1) but eccentric

to the latter in such a way that they lie in one plane
directly adjacent to one another and
dielectric material (8) is disposed in the two tubular
components (3).
Double exciter in accordance with Claim 1, 
characterised
in that
 the members (1), tubular components (3) and
transitions (2) have a rectangular section.
