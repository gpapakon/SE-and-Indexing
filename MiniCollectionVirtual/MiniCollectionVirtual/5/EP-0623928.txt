<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a diskette, in particular 
for informatics, as well as a method and device for 
manufacturing such diskettes. It is known that diskettes, in particular 3.5" diskettes, 
are usually provided with a write protection notch, also 
called "Write Protect" or "WP-notch", which can be placed 
in two positions. In a first, closed position, which can 
be indicated with the inscription "write enable", there 
are no restrictions to reading and overwriting. In the 
second, open position, which can be indicated with the 
inscription "write protect", the diskette can only be 
read with a PC and can only be written on with special 
duplicating equipment. For certain applications, however, diskettes are required 
which have no write protection notch, in other words 
diskettes which are permanently protected, which 
corresponds to the above-mentioned first position. These 
diskettes are used for writing out programs, one and 
other such that it is impossible for the ordinary user to 
accidentally delete or overwrite data on this diskette. 
Special equipment is used for writing out the programs. 
As a result, these diskettes cannot be used later on for 
any other purposes. The production lines for diskettes are usually fully 
automatic. Since there is more demand for diskettes with  
 
a write protection notch than for diskettes without one, 
it is not efficient to provide separate production lines 
for diskettes with a write protection notch on the one 
hand and for diskettes without a write protection notch 
on the other hand. Also, both sorts of diskettes are 
usually manufactured on one and the same production line. 
However, the production of diskettes without a write 
protection notch causes several problems to these 
production lines. For example, the supply and feed equipment for the write 
protection notches must be stopped and, since the design 
of the diskettes changes slightly, the detection and 
quality control equipment must be adjusted again. 
Moreover, a number of work stations are out of work in 
this case. Another disadvantage results from the well-known fact 
that a production line always produces diskettes of 
different qualities. The market for the diskettes having 
no write protection notch, however, in other words the 
diskettes which are permanently protected, demands the 
best quality only. Thus, the manufacturers are obliged 
to either regard the diskettes of lesser quality, which 
represent some 20% of the production, as waste, or to 
provide them manually with a

<CLAIMS>
Diskette of the type having a write protection notch 
(3), characterized in that it is provided with a lock (7) 

which permanently keeps the write protection notch (3) in 
the secured position. 
Diskette according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the lock (7) consists of at least one deformation (8,9) 

which keeps the write protection notch (3) in place. 
Diskette according to claim 2, characterized in that 

the 
deformation (8,9) consists of an indentation. 
Diskette according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the lock (7) consists of a glued joint between the 

housing (5) of the diskette (1) and the write protection 
notch (3). 
Diskette according to claim 1, characterized in that 
the lock (7) consists of a welded joint between the 

housing (5) of the diskette (1) and the write protection 
notch (3). 
Method for manufacturing diskettes, characterized in 
that it consists in producing diskettes (1) which are 

equipped with a controllable write protection notch (3) 
and the subsequent permanent locking of the write 

protection notch (3) in its secured position during final 
processing, such for at least a number of the produced 

 
diskettes (1). 
Method according to claim 6, characterized in that 
before the locking at least a number of the produced 

diskettes are tested, whereby it is verified whether they 
meet certain quality criteria, whereby the above-mentioned 

lock is only provided on those diskettes which 
meet the required quality criteria. 
Device for manufacturing diskettes according to the 
method of claim 6, characterized in that it mainly 

consists of a production line, which at least consists of 
means (12) for producing diskettes with a controllable 

write protection (2), formed of a write protection notch 
(3), and means (16) for locking the write protection 

notch (3) in the housing (5) during final processing on 
at least a number of the produced diskettes. 
Device according to claim 8, characterized in that it 
contains testing and selecting means (14), such that only 

diskettes which meet the required quality criteria are 
provided with locks (7).
