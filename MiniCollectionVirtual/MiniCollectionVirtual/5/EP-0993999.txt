<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method
for a motor vehicle security system (1) relating to

immobilizing and enabling of a fuel pump (18) for a motor
vehicle engine. The system (1) comprises data input means

(4,6) for receiving driver verification data, an engine
control unit (ECU) (2,10) including an ECU processor

(12,26) for controlling engine operation, a pump control
unit (PCU) (16) including a PCU processor (44) for

controlling the fuel pump (18), the PCU (16) being
separate from the ECU (2,10) and integrally housed with

the fuel pump (18). Communication links (24,40) permit
communication between the data input means (4,6) and ECU

(2,10), and between the ECU (2,10) and PCU (16). The ECU
processor (12,26) is activated to control the PCU (16)

when valid driver verification data is received. The PCU
processor 49 is then activated to communicate a challenge

code to the ECU. The ECU and PCU processors then compute
respectively a first and a second response code associated

with said challenge code. Finally, the PCU (16)
immobilizes the fuel pump (18) until such time as the PCU

(16) receives from the ECU (2,10) a first response code
which matches the second response code computed by the PCU

(16), whereupon the PCU is activated to control the fuel
pump (18) in response to the control of the ECU (2,10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and a method
for a motor vehicle security system, and in particular a
system and method relating to immobilizing and enabling of
a fuel pump for a motor vehicle.Motor vehicles such as motor cars are prone to theft. Many
different systems have therefore been proposed to make
motor vehicles more secure from theft. One popular
approach is to use an engine immobilizer, which is a
discrete device which cuts electrical power to essential
components, such as a fuel pump, an engine control unit
(ECU), or spark plugs, if a security device is not
deactivated when a person enters the car. Many
immobilizers, however, can be bypassed to restore power.Another approach is to incorporate the functions of the
immobilizer in the ECU, and to incorporate associated
electronic circuitry in a fuel pump. The fuel pump
circuitry has to receive a data signal from the ECU in
order to activate the fuel pump to respond to control
signals from the ECU. In this way, even if the ECU is
bypassed to provide power to the fuel pump, the fuel pump
will not work unless it has already received a valid
activation code from the engine control unit. This
improves security against vehicle theft, but
unfortunately, if a thief knows the correct activation
code for the fuel pump, the data line from the ECU to the
pump can be bypassed, and a valid activation code supplied
directly to the fuel pump. It is therefore possible for a
thief to defeat such a vehicle security system.It is an object of the present invention to provide a more
secure motor vehicle security system. Accordingly, the invention provides a motor vehicle engine
immobilization system comprising data input means for
receiving driver verification data, an engine control unit
including a first processor means for controlling engine
operation, a fuel pump for delivering fuel to the engine,
a pump control unit including a second processor means for
controlling the fuel pump, the pump control unit being
separate from the engine control unit and integrally
housed with the fuel pump, means by which the data input
means may communicate with the engine control unit, and
means by which the engine control unit may communicate
with the pump control unit, characterised in that:
a) the first processor means is activated to control
the engine including the pump control unit when valid
driver verification data is communicated from the data
input means to the engine control unit;b) the second processor means is activated to
communicate a challenge code to
