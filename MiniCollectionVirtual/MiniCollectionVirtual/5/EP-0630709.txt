<CLAIMS>
A horizontal continuous casting installation, in 
particular for casting steel, with a ladle having a 

base opening which can be blocked off and a hot means 
which communicates with at least two moulds, 

characterised in that the hot means is divided into a 
melt storage vessel (20) for storing and distributing 

the melt and melt guidance vessels (30, 40) succeeding 
said vessel, which guidance vessels serve exclusively 

for providing the initial running-in pressure for the 
subsequent moulds (34, 44) with the lowest possible 

volume for the melt, the melt storage vessel (20) being 
in the form of a distributing launder (23) which has at 

least two base openings (21, 22) which can be closed by 
means of controllable base closures (24, 25), and one 

melt guidance vessel (30, 40) is arranged in the 
direction of flow after each base opening (21, 22) of 

the distributing launder (23), which vessel is designed 
as a trough (31, 43) and to which in each case at least 

one mould (34, 44) is detachably fastened in the 
vicinity of the base. 
An installation according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the distributing launder (23) can 

be connected to a lifting means (27). 
An installation according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the trough-shaped vessels (33, 

43) are capable of receiving a melt volume which is the 
nth part of the capacity of the distributing launder 

(23), corresponding to the number (n) of the moulds. 
An installation according to Claim 3,
 
characterised in that the trough-shaped vessels (33, 

43) each have a pouring-in basin (36, 46) which can be  
 

positioned beneath the base openings (21, 22) of the 
distributor vessel (23). 
An installation according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that a weir (37, 47) is provided 

between the pouring-in basin (36, 46) and the trough of 
the vessel (33, 43), which weir has a height which 

corresponds to one-third to one-half of the rest of the 
wall of the pouring-in basins (36, 46). 
An installation according to Claim 3,
 
characterised in that a device (38, 48) can be 

connected to the trough-like vessels (33, 43) or to the 
moulds (34, 44) connected thereto, by means of which 

device the moulds (34, 44) and the vessel (33, 43) 
connected thereto can be moved back and forth with 

respect to the operating position.
