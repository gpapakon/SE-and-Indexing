  wherein:   A is lower alkyl, perfluorinated lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halogen, nitro, cyano or a mono- or polycyclic 5-12-membered, optionally partly hydrogenated aryl or heteroaryl radical having 1-4 heteroatoms such as O, S and N, which can optionally be substituted by lower alkyl, perfluoro-lower alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl, halogen, lower alkoxy, aryloxy, substituted aryloxy, heteroaryloxy, substituted heteroaryloxy and nitro, in which the designated substituents in the substituted aryl, substituted heteroaryl, substituted aryloxy and substituted heteroaryloxy are halogen, lower alkyl, perfluoro-lower alkyl, lower alkoxy and the like;   D is a 2-pyridyl radical or a radical

 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, M is a single bond, a straight-chain or branched carbon chain having 1-12 carbon atoms in the chain, it being possible for this chain to contain one or more double and/or triple bonds and/or one or more heteroatoms, such as O, S and N, or is a 5- to 12-membered mono- or polycyclic optionally partly hydrogenated aryl or heteroaryl radical having 1-4 heteroatoms such as O, S and N, which can be substituted by halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy;   Q is a single bond or a heteroatom such as O, S or N; R is hydrogen, a 5- to 12-membered mono- or polycyclic aryl or heteroaryl radical having 1-4 heteroatoms such as O, S and N, which can optionally be partly hydrogenated, or can also be substituted one or more times by halogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy; and   R1 is hydrogen, or

 wherein R2 is lower alkyl and R3 is lower alkyl, aryl or -OR4 where R4 is lower alkyl, cycloalkyl having 4-8 carbon atoms or aryl; and their pharmaceutically utilisable salts.
