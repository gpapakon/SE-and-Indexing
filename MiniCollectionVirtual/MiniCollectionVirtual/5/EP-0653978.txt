 STRIPPER PLATE LOCKING DEVICEBackground of the Invention:The present invention relates to the art of molding. More specifically, the present invention relates to a stripper plate locking device for use with multiplate multiopening mold assemblies.Stripper plate locking devices for use with two plate single opening mold assemblies are known. Two such devices are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,052,033 to Taylor and U.S. Patent No. 4,372,738 to Black et al. U.S. Patent No. 4,052,033 discloses a resiliently loaded ejector pin return and detent means which comprises resiliently expandable means which operate to provide for the early return of ejector pins into a die cavity in flush relationship with an inner surface thereof to prevent a laterally movable slide mechanism from hitting the extended ejector pins.The ejector pin return and detent means comprises a single generally tubular member having a plurality of resilient fingers surrounding a bore extending through the tubular member, the fingers being adapted to be 

spread apart y: a return rod and the outer portions of the fingers being expandable by the return rod when forced therebetween such as to be of a greater external dimension than the bore of a sleeve fixed to one of the die cavity members and whereby, when the aforementioned fingers are in the bore of the sleeve, the internal space between the fingers is less than the cross-section of the return rod, such that the return rod applies force to the ends of the fingers and thus, forces them out of the bore of the sleeve at the beginning of the closing of one die relative to the other and thus, movement of the fingers out of the last mentioned bore by reason of the return rod causes an ejector pin carrying member to move in a direction to retract the ejector pins into their respective die cavity into flush relationship with an inner surface thereof and out of the way of laterally movable slide mechanism so as to prevent the slide mechanism from hitting the extended ejector pins. The specific structure of the ejector pin return and detent means comprises a generally circular array of resilient fingers which are formed generally of a circular cross section structure, and wherein slots separate the fingers such that they may be resiliently deflected outward relative to each other and relative to a bore extending through the tubular member with which the fingers are integral, the fingers being closer together at one end of the tubular member than the cross section of the complimental return rod and the
