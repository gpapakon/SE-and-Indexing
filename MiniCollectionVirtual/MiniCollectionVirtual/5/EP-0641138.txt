<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for transmission of measured values on a plurality of measuring stations via a radio-frequency link to a central transceiver (16) is proposed, the measured values being transmitted successively in time. Each measuring station is allocated a measuring station transceiver (10-12). The central transceiver (16) exhibits a code transmitting device (30, 31) which successively sends out code signals allocated to the individual measuring station transceivers (10-12). The measuring station transceivers (10-12) are provided with a decoding device (25) triggering a measured value transmission only when associated code signals are received. During this interrogation of the individual measuring stations which occurs successively in time, a very simple allocation of the received measured values is possible and disturbances can scarcely influence the overall measuring sequence.

Apparatus for transmitting measured values from
a plurality of measurement points via a radio link to a

central transceiver (16), the measured values being
transmitted successively in time, each measurement

point having an associated measurement point
transceiver (10-12), the central transceiver (16)

containing a code transmission device (30, 31) which
successively transmits code signals associated with the

individual measurement point transceivers (10-12) and a
control and evaluation device (17) which allocates the

at least one measured value in each measured value
transmission to the appropriate measurement point

transceiver (10-12) using the previously transmitted
code signals and has a device for stipulating a time

window (T), and the measurement point transceivers
(10-12) being provided with a decoding device which

initiates a measured value transmission only when
allocated code signals are received, 
characterized in
that
 the control and evaluation device (17) is provided
with means for checking the reception of measured

values within the time window (T) after a code signal
has been despatched, an error message (36) being

triggered and/or the same code signal being transmitted
again at least once in the absence of measured values

within this time window (T).
Apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 each measurement point transceiver (10-12) is
provided with a disconnection apparatus which 

automatically disconnects its transmitter after
transmission of a prescribed number of measured values

or after a prescribeable transmission time.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that
 the control and evaluation device
(17) is provided with means for controlling the

despatch of code signals for the respectively next
measurement point transceiver (10-12) not before the

time window (T) has elapsed.
Apparatus according to Claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 the control and evaluation device (17) is
operatively connected to a switching device which

activates a transmission stage (31) of the central
transceiver (16) only during the despatch of code

signals.
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the measurement point
transceivers (10-12) and the central transceiver (16)

have a standard radio frequency which, in particular,
is variable.
Apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterized
in that
 setting elements (26), such as switches, are
provided for varying the radio frequency.
Apparatus according to Claim 5, 
characterized
in that
 code signals transmitted by the central
transceiver (16) are provided for varying the radio

frequency of the measurement point transceivers
(10-12).
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 a measurement point
transmitter (19), operating at another radio frequency,

for transmitting reference measured signals and an
additional reception stage (20) operating at this other

radio frequency are provided in the central transceiver
(16) .
Apparatus according to Claim 8, 
characterized
in that
 a comparison device for comparing the measured
values with the reference measured values is provided

in the control and evaluation device (17). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized by
 its being designed as a
measured value transmission system for testing th
e
brake pressure on motor vehicles, in particular heavy

goods vehicles.
Apparatus according to Claim 10, 
characterized
in that
 the measurement point transceivers (10-12) are
arranged on components of the braking system and the

central transceiver (16) is arranged on a brake test
bench.
Apparatus according to Claim 10 or 11,
characterized in that
 a reference measured signal is
the measured pressure value on a brake pressure

coupling head on the motor vehicle.
