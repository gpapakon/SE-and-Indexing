<ABSTRACT>
The composite totally synthetic plug (stopper) for wine bottles and drinks bottles of the same generic category is intended to help compensate for the shortage of qualitatively perfect natural cork. The plug is formed by a base body (1) made of plastic. Arranged on the top or bottom face (6, 7) or inside the base body (1) is a barrier layer (2) made of microfilter laminate which is impervious to liquid and greatly inhibits the passage of gas. Supplying and discharging gas ducts (5) with a variable cross-sectional area are caused to open out on the surface of the barrier layer (2), and thus a desired gas exchange between the bottle interior and the outer atmosphere can take place. The invention is based on the principle of metering an intentional gas exchange by using barrier layers (2) with different permeability or else changing the cross-sectional area at the barrier layer (2), through which the gas exchange is channelled. The barrier layer (2) may have a disc- or rod-shaped, also wedge- or cone-like form. To facilitate attachment of a corkscrew (10), a corkscrew bore (4) with a helical groove (11) is provided, in which case the gas duct (5) and the corkscrew bore (4) can merge into one another.

Multi-part sealing stopper made of plastics for 
bottles containing wine or wine-based drinks, consisting 

of a synthetic main component and a barrier layer which 
is impervious to liquids and greatly inhibits the 

passage of gas, characterised in that the barrier layer 
(2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) is formed by a microfilter laminate 

arranged on or in the main component (1), the desired 
permeability of the entire stopper - with regard to the 

exchange of gases between the inside of the bottle and 
the external atmosphere - being adjustable alternatively 

or conjointly by means of the choice of material and 
thickness of the barrier layer (2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) and 

by means of the arrangement and dimensions of corkscrew 
bores (4, 4a, 4a', 4b, 4b', 4d) opening on to the outer 

surface of the barrier layer (2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) and/or 
gas channels (5, 5a, 5a', 5a'', 5c, 5d) opening on to the 

outer surface, the exchange of gases being capable of 
being contro
lled by material-dependent and hence 
variable diffusion coefficients of the barrier layer (2, 

2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) and/or by variations in the sizes of the 
cross sectional areas at the exits and entrances of the 

corkscrew bores (4, 4a, 4a', 4b, 4b', 4d) or the gas 
channels (5, 5a, 5a', 5a'', 5c, 5d) which allow gas to 

pass through the barrier layer (2, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d). 
Sealing stopper according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the disc-shaped barrier layer (2) is arranged on 

the base surface (7) or on the end face (6) of the main 
component (1) of the stopper or inside the main 

component (1) and as such forms the chief barrier for 
the exchange of gases, the barrier layer (2) and the 

main component (1) achieving virtually total 
imperviousness even to gases, without an exit or entry 

channel to the barrier layer (2).  
 
Sealing stopper according to claim 2, characterised 
in that the barrier layer (2) is located on the base 

surface (7), and an axial corkscrew bore (4) - extending 
from the end face (6) of the main component (1) approximately 

to the centre of the stopper - is provided, with 
a helical groove (11) for easier insertion of a corkscrew 

(10), for the purpose of opening the bottle. 
Sealing stopper according to claim 2, characterised 
in that a stopper head (8) is attached to the end face 

(6) of the main component (1) for corking bottles of 
sparkling wine. 
Sealing stopper according to claim 1 or 3, 
characterised in that a gas channel (5) opening out 

substantially in the centre of the barrier layer (2) 
extends axially through the main component (1), as far 

as the end face (6), and otherwise,when a corkscrew bore 
(4) is provided, extending into the main component (1) 

from the end face (6), the gas channel (5) merges into 
it. 
Sealing stopper according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the disc-shaped barrier layer (2a) is arranged 

horizontally and in the middle of the main component 
(1), whilst gas channels (5a, 5a') open out in the 

centre of the base and top surfaces, respectively, of 
the barrier layer (2a), said gas channels (5a, 5a') 

extending axially upwards to the end face (6) and 
downwards to the base surface (7), respectively, in the 

main component (1), and otherwise, when upper and lower 
corkscrew bores (4a, 4a') are provided, said gas 

channels merge into them, and - to help the driving of 
the sealing stopper into the neck of the bottle - 

rounded areas (9) are provided on the main component 
(1), in the region of the end face and base surface (6,  

 
7), and furthermore the outside of the main component 

(1) has a fluted surface (3) to improve the leaktight 
fit of the sealing stopper in the neck of the bottle. 
Sealing stopper according to claim 6, characterised 
in that the opening surfaces of the gas channels (5a, 

5a'') leading to the centre of the base and top surfaces 
of the barrier layer (2a) are of different sizes, and 

the material of the barrier layer (2a) has a 
preferential direction of passage, generally or only for 

certain gases. 
Sealing stopper according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the disc-shaped barrier layer (2c) is inserted 

in the end face (6) and a gas channel (5c) opening out 
downwardly - towards the base surface (7) - in a funnel 

shape extends from the centre of the underside of the 
barrier layer (2c), this gas channel (5c) helping to 

increase the elasticity of the sealing stopper, and, in 
the turned position, simultaneously acting as an opening 

for the corkscrew (10), when the sealing stopper is 
driven into the neck of the bottle. 
Sealing stopper according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the barrier layer (2b) is rod-shaped in 

configuration and is mounted on the vertical axis of the 
main component (1), in the centre thereof, whilst gas 

channels, which may also be formed entirely or in part 
as corkscrew bores (4b, 4b'), and which extend axially 

to the end face (6) and to the base surface (7), open 
on to the base surface and top surface of the barrier 

layer (2b). 
Sealing stopper according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the barrier layer (2d) is wedge-shaped or 

conical and is arranged horizontally, approximately 
halfway up and inside the main component (1), whilst  

 
opening out onto the underside of the outer surface of 

the barrier layer (2d) are a plurality of gas channels 
(5d) which extend to the base surface (7), and opening 

out on the upper surface of the outside of the barrier 
layer (2d) is a gas channel extending axially to the end 

face (6), which may also consist entirely or in part 
of a corkscrew bore (4d) and which can be positioned 

offset, with variable diameter, on the x coordinate - 
in a way spaced from the vertical axis of the main 

component (1) - so that, by means of the variation in 
diameter, a different cross sectional area of opening of 

the gas channel abuts on the outer surface of the 
barrier layer (2d), and, by means of the shift in 

position, the cross section of opening of the gas 
channel abuts on a barrier layer of different thickness 

(2d). 
Sealing stopper according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that GORE TEXÂ® is used as the 

microfilter laminate.
