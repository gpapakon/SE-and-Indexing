<ABSTRACT>
The process for the combustion of fuels, particularly waste, in combustion installations with grate firing, wherein primary air is fed underneath the grate firing into the fuel bed and secondary air is fed above the fuel bed, is controlled in such a way that the intensity of combustion of the fuel on the firing grate is enhanced by increasing the oxygen content of the primary air and the intensity of combustion in the secondary combustion zone is restricted by reducing the oxygen content of the secondary air, and that an exhaust gas recycled from the combustion process is preferably used for reducing the oxygen content in the secondary air.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the combustion of fuels, particularly waste, in combustion plants with 
grate firing, in which primary air is fed under the grate into the fuel bed and 

secondary air is fed above the fuel bed, characterised in that the combustion 
intensity of the fuel on the grate is increased at least in parts thereof by increasing 

the oxygen content of the primary air to 25 to 50 % by volume with a resulting 
percentage reduction in the nitrogen content of the primary air relative to the 

ambient air and that above the fuel bed, once the removal of oxidisable harmful 
substances has been substantially completed, the combustion intensity in the 

secondary combustion zone is throttled by reducing the oxygen content in the 
secondary air relative to the ambient air by means of recycled waste gas, the 

recycled waste gas making up 20 to 65 % of the total quantity of air and gas fed 
into the combustion process. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the oxygen content of the 
primary air is increased locally as a function of the combustion behaviour or the 

combustion intensity of the fuel bed situated on the grate departing from the oxygen 
content of the ambient air and that the secondary air is adjusted locally with respect 

to composition, quantity, feed point and high turbulence in the secondary 
combustion zone so as to substantially prevent the formation of nitrogen oxides 

above the fuel bed. 
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that the oxygen content of 
the primary air is only increased in the main combustion zone of the primary 

combustion zone of the grate. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the oxygen content 
of the primary combustion air is adjusted as a function of the surface temperature of 

the fuel.  
 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the oxygen content 
in the secondary air is adjusted as a function of the temperature in the secondary 

combustion zone. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the oxygen content 
in the secondary air is adjusted as a function of the length of the flames in the 

vertical extent in the combustion chamber. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the waste gas to be 
recycled is exhausted after flowing through the boiler. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the waste gas to be 
recycled is exhausted immediately above the fuel bed.
