<ABSTRACT>
The system permits the separation of the various components of blood. It 
consists of 1 bag (2a) placed in a container pressurizing portion (22) and 

3 other child bags, the first of which (2b) Is placed on a first weighting 
portion (101-104), and the remaining 2 child bags (2c,2d) are both suspended 

from the second weighting portion (102-33A-33B) where they can be separately 
assessed for weight changes by an appropriate logic switching. 
The changing level of fluid in the parent bag is detected by opto-electronic 

means (121-122).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solution separating
apparatus, and particularly to a solution separating
apparatus for separating blood plasma, red blood corpuscles,
etc. from a flexible container such as a blood bag.Since an evil effect of a total blood transfusion has
heretofore been regarded as a big issue, a blood transfusion
of only blood component is popularly performed at present for
the purpose of minimizing, as much as possible, a side effect
caused by physical burden to patients, immunity, etc. by
performing a blood transfusion of only a blood component or
components necessary for patients among various kinds of blood
components. As a consequence, it is required to prepare
a component formulation, and in order to prepare a component
formulation, it is further required that blood in a blood bag
is divided into each component by a centrifugal separator,
and each component is separated in a separation bag.An apparatus for separating blood in such blood bag
into each component is disclosed in Japanese Patent Early
Laid-open Publication No. Sho 63-119776. The conventional solution separating
apparatus includes a plurality of container holding portions
for holding a parent bag and a plurality of child bags
connected by a tube, a plurality of tube clampers for
clamping tubes communicating with the respective bags, a
container pressurizing portion for pressurizing the parent
bag held by the container holding portion and pushing out a
portion of the solution in the parent bag for separation, a
weight measuring portion such as a weight disposed at a
container holding portion for each child bag, and control
units for controlling the tube clampers and the container
pressurizing portion and making it possible to transfer the
solution to be separated from the parent bag to the child
bags which are in communicating relation through the unclamped
tubes. The control unit causes the corresponding tube 
clamper to clamp the tube communicating with the child bag
when the quantity of the solution transferred to the child bag
from the parent bag has reached a preset level and then
finishes the separating operation.By the way, the weight measuring portions of the
solution separating apparatus disposed in each container
holding portion for each child bag as mentioned above have
the following functions 1 ○∼3 ○.
1 ○ To measure the quantity of blood and additive
solution transferred from the parent bag and other child bags.2 ○ To measure the quantity of blood and additive
solution transferred to the parent bag and other

<CLAIMS>
A solution separating apparatus (20) including a plurality of
containers (2a, 2b, 2c, 2d) connected with each other by tubes (14, 15a, 15b), a

plurality of tube clampers (38, 39) for clamping the tubes
communicating with the respective containers, a container

pressurizing portion (22) disposed in such a manner as to correspond
to at least one first container holding portion (21) and adapted to

pressurize a flexible container (2a) held by the first container holding
portion and push out a portion of solution contained in the container

for separation, a control unit (26) capable of controlling the tube
clampers (38, 39) and the container pressurizing portion (22) so as to

make it possible to transfer solution between the containers (2a, 2b, 2c,
2d) in communication with each other through unclamped tubes (14,

15a, 15b), and a weight measuring portion (102), characterised in that
it comprises a plurality of second container holding portions (23B,

23C) for holding the plurality of containers (2c, 2d) and a single
weight measuring portion (102) in common to two or more second

container holding portions (23B, 23C), the quantities of weight change
of the respective containers (2b, 2c) held by the second container

holding portions (23B, 23C) being able to be selectively measured by
recognition of the contain
ers communicating with unclampled tubes by
the control unit (26). 
The solution separating apparatus (20) according to
claim 1, wherein the control unit (26) is capable of

obtaining the result measured by the weight measuring
portion (102) and recognizing the container holding portion

(23B, 23C) for holding containers (2b, 2c) which are in
communication with an unclamped tube (15a, 15b) this time,

the control unit further being capable of calculating the
quantities of weight change of the containers held by the

container holding portion from the result of measurement
obtained by the weight measuring portion. 
The solution separating apparatus (20) as claimed in
claim 1 or 2, which further includes a solution quantity

setting portion (60) for setting a solution quantity which
should be contained in the containers (2b, 2c), and a memory

portion (40c) for storing the set solution quantity, the
memory portion being capable of rewriting and reading the

stored data, the stored data being not lost even if the main
electric power source is cut off, the control unit (26)

recognizing that the solution quantity in the corresponding
container has reached the set solution quantity in

accordance with the data of the set solution quantity stored
in the memory portion and the result of measurement obtained

by the weight measuring portion, and clamping the tube
communicating with the container through the corresponding

tube clamper.
