<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus of and a method for performing hitless 
switching between optical transmission lines such as 

optical fiber circuits are provided. An optical switch 
or optical switching network having input terminals and 

output terminals for selecting optical signals inputted 
to the input terminals to the output terminals with a 

selection ratio which can be varied continuously is used. 
An optical signal converter for generating an optical 

signal of light which does not interfere with another 
optical signal is attached to the optical switch. Further, 

a signal loop interconnecting one of the output 
terminals of the switch and the input of the optical 

signal converter is provided. When hitless switching 
between two optical transmission lines is performed, the 

same information signal is first inputted to the two 

transmission lines on the transmission side, then the 
optical signal from the two lines are transmitted to one 

of the output terminal (aimed output terminal) of the 
switch and another output terminal connected to the 

signal loop. The phase difference between the optical 
signals is detected and adjusted, and the optical switch 

is controlled so that the optical signal to be selected 
at the aimed output terminal is varied to the signal 

passing through the signal loop.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a hitless switching apparatus 
and method for optical transmission lines in an 
optical network. In an optical network which includes a plurality of 
nodes and optical transmission lines formed from optical 
fibers or the like for interconnecting the nodes, it is 
sometimes desired to switch a route along which a signal 
is transmitted without interrupting transmission of a 
signal between two nodes. Switching is desired, for 
example, when it is tried, after the signal transmission 
route is switched to a bypass route due to the occurrence 
of trouble in a certain optical transmission line or 
node, to switch the signal transmission line back to the 
original route after recovery from the trouble or when 
another route must be used to transmit a signal in order 
to perform construction or maintenance of the equipment. 
Here, to switch the signal transmission route to a different 
optical fiber accommodated in the same optical 
fiber cable is included within switching the signal 
transmission route to another route. Since switching of  
 
an optical transmission generally takes place independently 
of communication between users in a network, a 
countermeasure must be taken upon switching to prevent 
the switching from causing an obstacle to regular communication 
of the user. In particular, hitless switching 
must be achieved so that an error of even one bit is not 
produced. In this instance, since a transmission route 
before switching and another transmission route after 
switching generally present different propagation delay 
amounts, switching that absorbs the difference between 
the propagation delay amounts must be realized. Since 
the difference in propagation delay time between the 
routes is quite large compared with the time per signal 
bit, mere switching between transmission lines using an 
optical switch cannot realize hitless switching. Even 
for switching to a different optical fiber in the same 
optical fiber cable, since the transmission rate is as 
high as 1 Gbit/second or more, the phase of the signal 
cannot be identical between the optical fibers and it is 
necessary to compensate for the difference in time. A hitless switching system suitable for use with an 
optical network is disclosed, for example, in Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Application No. 80636/91 (JP, A, 3-80636) 
or No. 56925/92 (JP, A, 4-56925). Fig. 1 shows 
the construction of the hitless switching system disclosed 
in the former application. An optical fiber cable
