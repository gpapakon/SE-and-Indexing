<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
halogenation process for star-branched polymers with 
improved neutralization of the hydrogen halide by-product 
resulting from the halogenation. The term 
"star-branched" relative to polymers is used herein to 
refer to polymers comprising a plurality of branches, 
typically linear, emanating from the same or closely 
spaced location on the polymer backbone. Halogenation processes in which a polymer is 
reacted with a halogenation agent to produce a 
halogenated polymer containing chemically bound halogen 
and a hydrogen halide by-product followed by 
neutralization of the hydrogen halide by-product by 
contacting the halogenation reaction product with an 
alkaline material which reacts with the hydrogen halide 
by-product are well known. European Patent Application 88311634.5 filed 
December 8, 1988 (Publication No. EP 0320 263 A2 
published June 14, 1989), the teachings of which are 
hereby incorporated by reference, discloses star-branched 
copolymers of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a 
C4 to C14 multiolefin (i.e., star-branched butyl 
rubber), and a process for halogenating these star-branched 
polymers, including a halogenation process in 
which the star-branched copolymer is dissolved in an 
organic solvent. U.S. Patent 3,099,644 (Parker et al.) is 
directed to a halogenation process for butyl rubber. 
It discloses that in the early production of  
 
chlorobutyl rubber before the current solvent 
replacement process was developed, the practice was to 
recover dry regular butyl rubber and then redissolve it 
to prepare a solution for halogenation. In recovering 
regular butyl, the practice is to withdraw a slurry of 
the polymer in methyl chloride diluent from the reactor 
and introduce it into a tank of hot water to flash off 
the methyl chloride and unreacted monomers. This water 
regularly contains a small amount of polymer dispersing 
agent such as zinc stearate or calcium stearate or 
other metal soap to prevent the polymer particles from 
agglomerating and to keep them dispersed in the water. 
Much of this dispersing agent is picked up by the 
polymer so that when that process is used, the butyl 
solutions submitted to halogenation, unless specially 
treated, contain small amounts of these polymer 
dispersing agents. These act as emulsifying agents 
when the polymer solution is treated with dilute 
solution of caustic in the neutralization step (col. 3, 
lines 58 to 72). The presence of these dispersing 
agents was perceived as a problem, as discussed in 
Pa
