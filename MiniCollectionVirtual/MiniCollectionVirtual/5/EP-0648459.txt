<ABSTRACT>
The cooking vessel is made from a disc (3) of metal or light alloy. It comprises a bottom (1) intended to be laid on a hotplate, burner or the like. The bottom (1) comprises a plate (2) in a metal having different properties from those of the metal of the disc (3). This plate (2) is fully or partly let into the bottom (1) and its circumference may adjoin a groove (4). For improving the resistance to the deformation of the bottoms of cooking vessels.

A cooking vessel made from a pressed sheet (3) of
metal or light alloy, comprising a base (1) intended to

be placed on a hotplate, a burner or the like, said
base (1) being slightly concave, characterised in that

the said base (1) comprises a centred plate (2), which
may possibly comprise a plurality of elements and which

covers only a reduced portion of the base, of a metal
or alloy which has mechanical, thermal, and physical

properties different from those of the metal or alloy
of the said sheet (3), said plate (2) being embedded in

the said base (1).
A cooking vessel according to claim 1,
characterised in that it is made from a sheet (3) of

aluminium and the said plate (2) is of steel.
A cooking vessel according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the concavity of the base (1) is

such that when it is placed on a hotplate, the bearing
surface (5) of the base situated around the plate (2),

which has different properties, touches the hotplate,
while the said plate (2) does not touch the hotplate.
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 1
to 3, characterised in that the said plate (2) covers

between 5 and 30% of the surface of the base (1).
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 1
to 4, characterised in that the plate (2) has holes (6)

and is partially embedded in the base (1). 
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 1
to 5, characterised in that the plate (2) has a

thickness of between 3/10
th
 and 5/10
th
 of a millimetre
and is embedded in the base (1) to a depth of between

0.5/10
th
 and 1.5/10
th
 of a millimetre, for an aluminium
base of a thickness of between 2.5 and 5 mm.
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 1
to 6, characterised in that the plate (2) is adjacent a

groove (4) formed in the base (1).
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 1
to 7, characterised in that the plate (2) is in the

form of a disc or a ring possibly divided into a
plurality of sectors.
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 1
to 7, characterised in that the plate (2) is centred on

the base of the vessel.
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 1
to 7, characterised in that the plate (2) is not

centred on the base of the vessel.
A cooking vessel according to any one of claims 5
to 8, characterised in that the holes (6) in the plate

(2) have a dimension less than twice the spacing
between two holes.
A cooking vessel according to claim 11,
characterised in that the holes (6) have a diameter of

about 3 mm and the space between two holes (6) is about
2 mm.
