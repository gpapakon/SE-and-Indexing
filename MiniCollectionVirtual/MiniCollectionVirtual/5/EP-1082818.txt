<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to radio transmitters and receivers.Commercial and military radios often need to communicate or could benefit by having the capability of communicating with two or more radio networks, each of which is of a different type. One example of this need is found in the cellular telephone market where different modes of operation are presently available leading to the present need for so-called "dual mode" cellular phones. The dual modes refer to different waveforms. As used herein, "waveform" refers to functional transformation of information such as speech to a modulated rf carrier and encompasses the entire process of going from speech to antenna and/or vice versa. To operate over multiple waveforms has in the past required that various pieces of equipment be utilized. As new waveform technologies develop, existing equipment becomes unusable with such waveforms.WO 98 14023 discloses a communications device in which a microcontroller is used to access code and data from a system memory in order to operate the communications device in accordance with one standard at a time. The microcontroller is also needed to control the operations of one or more digital signal processors to balance computational throughput and power consumption based on the application being performed.EP-A-0 712 213 discloses an integrated circuit that provides multiple communication functions and includes memory which stores an audio code algorithm, echo cancellation information, a modern processing algorithm and audio data. The memory is coupled via a data bus to a signal converter, a central processing unit and a first co-processor. The signal converter provides an analog-to-digital input port and a digital-to-analog output port for the integrated circuit, wherein the audio data is received via the analog-to-digital input port. The central processing unit executes at least a first portion of the audio coding algorithm upon the audio data and executes a first portion of the modern processing algorithm, while the first co-processor executes an echo cancellation algorithm.It is desirable to provide a radio which is useable as a generic radio platform with existing waveforms and yet to be developed waveforms.The invention will be better understood from a reading of the following detailed description in conjunction with the drawing in which like reference designators indicate like elements in the various drawing figures, and in which:
