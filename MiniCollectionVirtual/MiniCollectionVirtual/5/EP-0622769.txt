<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a portable box (1) intended to inform the users of an omnibus network of the waiting times for omnibuses at the various stops of this network. Simple actuations of keys (3, 4, 5), translated by appropriate displays on a screen (2) of the box, make it possible to store several bus journeys in this box, which terminate respectively at predetermined stops of the network, and simply pressing on a button (6 or 7) allows selective display on the said screen of any one of the stored journeys, with visual information on the waiting times for buses at the stop at which this journey terminates.

<CLAIMS>
A portable appliance for informing users of an urban
bus network about waiting times for buses at various

stops of the network, the appliance being suitable for
co-operating with an installation designed to generate

and transmit signals, preferably cyclically and over an
electromagnetic path, which signals provide information

about the respective instantaneous real positions of the
buses of the network, the appliance including an

electrical power supply, user-actuatable interrogation
means suitable for identifying any specified stop of the

network, means suitable for receiving the above-mentioned
signals and for selecting those of said signals which

relate at least to the "next bus" expected at the
identified stop, and means including a video screen

suitable for displaying on said screen information
associated with the waiting time for the next bus at said

stop, the appliance being characterized in that it
comprises: firstly, programing means including memory

means suitable for storing a first list (A) in the clear
of the various lines of the network together with their

destinations, a plurality of second lists (B) in the
clear of the various stops on the various lines, and

optionally a third list (C) identifying a plurality of
memories each designed to store data relating to an

approach run-up performed by the buses to be caught
immediately prior to reaching a selected stop, and

control means serving firstly to display and to scroll on
the screen (2) of the appliance (1) successively the

first list, a specially selected one of the second lists,
and a third list if provided, and secondly to "confirm"

within each list a reference that is selected to be taken
into account, each confirmation causing the display to

move on to the following list that corresponds to the
selection that has been performed; and secondly,

operational means suitable for displaying in succession
on the screen of the appliance data relating to the 

various bus approach run-ups that have previously been
selected and optionally stored, which data comprises, for

each run-up, visible information associated with the
waiting times for the next buses expected at the stop at

which said run-up terminates.
A portable appliance according to claim 1,

characterized in that the programming means comprise
three control keys (5, 3, 4) associated respectively with

confirmation and with scrolling the lists in each of two
directions, and in that the operational means comprise

two control buttons (6, 7) associated respectively with
renewing the display of the last run-up to be displayed,

and with displaying in succession the run-ups that have
been stored.
A portable appliance according to claim 2,

characterized in that it is organized in such a manner
that a further press on the first control button (6) has

the effect of a further display of the bus approach run-up
terminating at a stop, as taken from the second list,

and that has previously merely been confirmed without
being specifically stored.
A portable appliance according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that it includes means suitable for

emitting a signal, in particular a sound signal, as soon
as the waiting time for the next bus at a monitored

selected stop drops below a predetermined threshold.
A portable appliance according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that it is in the form of a flat

rectangular parallelepiped having rounded edges and
easily holdable in one hand, being organized in such a

manner that when held in the hand it is easy to use the
thumb of the hand concerned to actuate the buttons (6, 7)

for controlling the display of stored run-ups while also 
allowing the user to see clearly the data displayed on

the screen relating to said stored run-ups.
A portable appliance according to claim 5,

characterized in that the three sides of the rectangular
parallelepiped defining said appliance have sizes lying

respectively in the following ranges: 5 cm to 6 cm, 8 cm
to 9 cm, and 0.5 cm to 2 cm, and in that the screen (2)

is in the form of a rectangle having rounded corners and
occupying about 3 cm by 6 cm, which rectangle is offset

towards one of the corners of the appliance, thereby
leaving two broad margins adjacent to the opposite corner

comprising a short margin (12) and a long margin (13)
that together form an L-shape, the three keys (3, 4, 5)

being disposed side by side in the short broad margin and
the two buttons (6, 7) for controlling the display of

stored run-ups being disposed in that portion of the long
broad margin that is furthest from the short broad

margin.
A portable appliance according to any preceding claim,
characterize
d in that the means for programing the
appliance further include memory means suitable for

storing a fourth list (D) specifying different times of
day, means associated with control means and display

means that enable the appliance to be "woken up" at a
given future instant that is a predetermined length of

time prior to the expected approximate time at which the
appliance is next to be used.
