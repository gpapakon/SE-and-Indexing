Push button switch having a switch rod (6), the 
stroke of which produces a pressure point, a switch 

movement and a resetting tension under spring action, 
and a one-part spring element (16) having good 

electrical conductivity is provided which on the one 
hand forms a resiliently movable contact arm (26) and 

on the other hand a resilient resetting arm (21) which 
abuts the switch rod (6), and formed on the spring 

element (16) between the contact arm (26) and the 
resetting arm (21) are resilient guide arms (18) bent 

in a hairpin shape, on which the switch rod (6) can be 
moved, and formed at least on the guide arm coupled to 

the contact arm (26) is a steep step (24), on which the 
switch rod (6) acts in its stroke, with pivoting of the 

guide arm (18) and hence of the contact arm (26), the 
contact arm being associated with a first conductive 

surface (5) of a plate (2), and a connecting arm (20) 
of the spring element (16), joining the resetting arm 

(21) to the one guide arm (18), rests on a second 
conductive surface (4) of the push button switch (3), 

and the connecting arm (20) with the resetting arm (21) 
have a hairpin shaped design, characterised in that the 

switch rod (6) is guided longitudinally in the 
actuation direction (B) and can be tilted steeply to 

the actuation direction (B), is guided by means of a 
slope (15) or by means of a projection (35) on one 

guide arm (17) after leaving the step (24), and presses 
the one guide arm (18) further towards the other guide 

arm (17) so that the contact arm (26) strikes the 
conductive surface (5). 
Push button switch according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the switch rod (6) has an arm  

 
(13) with a passage (14) through which the guide arms 

(17, 18) protrude, the guide arms (17, 18) lying near 
the actuation device (b) which acts on the switch rod 

(6). 
Push button switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the switch rod 

(6) has a lug (30) which presses on the contact arm 
(26) lying on the conductive surface (5). 
Push button switch according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the pressure with which the 

switch rod (6) presses the contact arm (26) onto the 
conductive surface (5) is greater than the pressure at 

the pressure point (D).
