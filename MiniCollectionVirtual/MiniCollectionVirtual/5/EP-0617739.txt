<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for continuously melting down scrap metal, in particular bales of scrap metal containing residual plastic materials, the scrap being fed to a melt-down reactor (1) and the heat necessary to melt the scrap being provided by direct heating from underneath by burners (7) located near the tapping point. Part of the gases (12) produced are passed back, after utilizing the sensible heat (16) and cleaning (21, 23, 29), as combustion gas into the melt-down reactor and the remainder passed out as output gas (35). A particular advantage of the invention is that, when melting down scrap metal containing plastic, it avoids the need for large-scale gas-purifying facilities and the pyrolysed materials contained in the starting material are utilized to good effect.

<CLAIMS>
A process for continuously melting scrap and, in
particular, scrap bales containing residual synthetic

substances, wherein the scrap is charged into a meltdown
reactor (1) and the melting heat is applied by direct heating

from below via burners (7) arranged near the tap and wherein
process control in the meltdown reactor (1) is effected in a

reducing manner, characterized in that a portion of the
process gases, after utilization of the sensible heat and

purification, is recycled into the meltdown reactor (1) as a
combustion gas and the remaining portion is delivered as an

export gas.
A process according to claim 1, characterized in that the
process gases drawn off are recycled into the meltdown reactor

(1) as heated combustion gases by more than 20 % by volume
after purification and, in particular, HCl scrubbing and

SO
2
/H
2
S separation and the remaining portion is drawn off as
an export gas.
A process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the sensible heat of the offgases is utilized for preheating

the combustion gases recycled into the meltdown reactor (1).
A process according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in
that the CO content of the process gases from the meltdown

reactor is adjusted to 30 to 40 % by volume and, in
particular, about 36 % by volume by understoichiometric O
2
 gas
feeding.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the export gas exceeding the recycled

portion of the process gases after adsorptive purification is
discharged at a calorific value of between 1.5 and 2 kWh.m
-3
n. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the process gas and, in particular, the

export gas is adjusted to a calorific value of between 3.0 and
3.5 kwh.m
-3
n and, in particular, 3.3 kwh.m
-3
n above a coke bed
reactor (15).
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that scrap grades having chemi
cally bound
energy contents of 
>
 0.6 kwh.t
-1
 are introduced into the
meltdown reactor (1) as charging materials (2).
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the process gases are conducted over a

mixed bed adsorber (29) operated with coke (32) and lime (33)
and the loaded adsorbent is recycled into the meltdown reactor

(1).
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterized in that the process offgases are fed to a

thermoreactor (15) via a coarse separator and, in particular,
a hot gas cyclone (13) and subsequently are fed to a heat

exchanger (16) for heating the combustion gas to be
recirculated.
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
characterized in that the process gas conducted in circulation

is preheated to a temperature of between 500 and 700°C and, in
particular, about 600°C by countercurrent heating with the

process gases before entering the burners (7).
