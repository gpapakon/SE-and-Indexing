<ABSTRACT>
In load-carrying arrangement for fitting a load carrier (1) to the rear of a motor vehicle (F), especially a passenger car, by means of a releasable coupling device (5) having a coupling component (5a) fitted to the vehicle (F), a coupling component (5b) fitted to the load carrier (1) and connectors (52a, 52b) fitted to the coupling components (5a, 5b) and joining them together, the coupling component (5a) fitted to the vehicle (F) with its connector (52a) is recessed in a space (19) in the vehicle's coachwork (K), and the coupling component (5b) fitted to the load carrier (1) can be guided through an aperture (19a) in the space (19) into its coupling engagement position, an actuating component (56) being arranged to be manually accessible from outside the coachwork (K) and adjustably fitted, with which the movable connector (52b) can be set to or secured in its coupling position or set to its uncoupled position.
