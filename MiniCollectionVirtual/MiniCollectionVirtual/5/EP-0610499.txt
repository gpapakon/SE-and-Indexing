<ABSTRACT>
A proteoglycan(G 009) obtained from cultured 
ganoderma lucidum
, which contains β-glucose, α-glucose, galactose, α-mannose 
and fructose as the saccharide components and glycine, lysine, alanine, histidine, arginine, valine, aspartic acid, threonine, 

isoleucine, serine, leucine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, proline, phenylalanine and methionine as the protein components, and 

has an effect of enhancing antitumor immunity.

<DESCRIPTION>
Figure 1is a saccharide analysis chromatogram of proteoglycan G009 according to
the present invention.Figure 2is an amino acid chromatogram of proteoglycan G009 according to the
present inventionFigure 3is an IR analysis diagram of proteoglycan G 009 according to the present
invention.Figure 4is a microphotograph showing the mycelia of a strain IY 009 according to
the present inventionFigure 5is a diagram drawn to compare the specificity of a strain IY 009
according to the present invention.The present invention relates to a proteoglycan effective for promotion of
antitumor immunity.In order to search for a new proteoglycan which has the effect of promotion
antitumor immunity, the present inventors collected a large number of basidiomycetes
and attempted to separate a proteoglycan produced by those basidiomycetes. In sequel
thereto, it was found that the basidiomycete which belongs to the genus of
ganoderma, picked up in the area of the Dooryoon Mountains located in the South
Cholla Province, produces a proteoglycan which has the effect of promoting antitumor
immunity when cultured in a proper culture medium. After the produced proteoglycan
was separated and its physicochemical and biophysical properties was examined, it was
designated as proteoglycan G009 which has the effect of promiting antitumor immunity 
and the strain which produces it was designated as ganodermalucidum IY 009 ( a number
of deposition to the Korean Species Association is KFCC-107090 dated Oct. 5, 1990)Although researches have been conducted in such medicinal components as
antibacterial, hallucinative, toxicant and cholesterol-lowering components from the
basidiomycetes belonging to a higher fungus, earnest study is now given to an
antitumor component and an immunity improvement action, and so basidiomycetes are
rising in importance. Thus, those strains which secrete such matter as contains an
antitumor component and improves an immunity function was separated and cultured in
liquid to make a study of its pharmacological effect.During the study, a mutant strain which has an antitumor effect and an
immunity improvement function that are more excellent than the species belonging to
the genus of ganoderma which has been identified until now was separated and an
in-liquid mycelia culture method was established and then the antitumor effect and
immunity improvement function of those components extracted from the cultured mycelia
were confirmed.The present invention will now be described in detail according to the
following embodiment
</DESCRIPTION>
