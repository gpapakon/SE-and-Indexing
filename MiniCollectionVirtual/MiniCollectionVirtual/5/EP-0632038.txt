<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel methotrexate
derivatives, more particularly to novel methotrexate
derivatives that are useful as antirheumatic agents.Methotrexate had long been used as a therapeutic
agent for leukemia but ever since Gubner et al. reported
its effectiveness in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) and psoriasis in 1951, methotrexate has been used as
a therapeutic agent for RA in both Europe and the United
States of America. Fairly recently, detailed investigations
were conducted on the method of administration and dose of
methotrexate to reveal that low-dose methotrexate therapy
causes fairly less side effects and yet exhibit excellent
efficacy. However, the administration of methotrexate
causes various side effects that cannot be ignored, such
as hepatopathy and pulmonary fibrosis and, hence, a strong
need exists for the advent of drugs that cause lesser side
effects without compromise in their efficacy.The present inventors conducted intensive studies in
search for methotrexate derivatives that excel methotrexate
in efficacy as a rheumatism treating agent. The present
invention has been accomplished on the basis of these
studies. The present invention provides methotrexate
derivatives that are represented by the following general
formula (I):
