<ABSTRACT>
A colon selective pharmaceutical composition for oral delivery of one or more therapeutically active substances, comprises (i) a matrix core having the active substance or substances dispersed therein, and (ii) an outer cover layer without any active substance, said matrix core and cover layer being selectively degradable by enzymes normally occurring in the colon. A method of preparing such a colon selective pharmaceutical composition comprises the steps of mixing at least one therapeutically active substance with a matrix material to prepare a matrix core having the active substance or substances dispersed therein, and coating said matrix core with a material without any active substance therein to provide the matrix core with a drug-free protective cover layer, said matrix and cover layer materials being based upon at least one substance which is selectively degradable by enzymes in the colon.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel colon 
selective pharmaceutical composition as well as to a 
process for its preparation. The conventionally used pharmaceutical compositions 
for oral delivery of drugs which are to exert their 
activity locally in the colon are not quite satisfactory. 
For example, they release a considerable amount of the 
active component already on their way to the colon tract 
and/or the release of the active component is too slow once 
the composition has reached the colon. The present invention aims at overcoming the 
deficiencies of the prior art compositions by providing an 
improved colon selective composition which substantially 
retains the drug within the composition matrix until it 
reaches the colon, at which time the drug is quickly and 
efficiently released, as well as a process for the 
preparation of such a composition. According to a first basic concept of the present 
invention a pharmaceutical composition for oral delivery 
of a therapeutically active substance has the latter 
dispersed in a matrix material core, at least a substantial 
part of which is selectively degradable by the enzymes 
normally occurring in the colon, thereby providing for 
rapid decomposition of the matrix and momentary release of 
the active substance(s) dispersed therein once the 
composition has reached the colon. According to a second basic concept of the invention, 
the matrix core is provided with a protective cover layer 
having no therapeutically active substance dispersed 
therein, which protective cover layer also is selectively 
degradable in the colon. Such a cover layer will serve as a 
protective or wear layer during the transport of the 
composition through the gastro-intestinal tract and prevent 
leakage of the active substance(s) from the matrix core 
into the surrounding medium.  
 Thus, in one aspect the present invention provides a 
colon selective pharmaceutical composition for oral 
delivery of one or more therapeutically active substances, 
comprising (i) a matrix core having the active substance(s) 
dispersed therein, and (ii) an outer cover layer without 
any active substance dispersed therein, said matrix core 
and cover layer being selectively degradable by enzymes 
normally occurring in the colon, such that the composition 
substantially will retain the active substance(s) therein 
until it reaches the colon, when the active substance(s) 
will be released. In another aspect the present invention provides a 
method for the preparation of such a colon

<CLAIMS>
A colon selective pharmaceutical composition for oral 
delivery of one or more therapeutically active substances, 

comprising (i) a matrix core having the active substance or 
substances dispersed therein, and (ii) an outer cover layer 

without any active substance, said matrix core and cover 
layer being selectively degradable by enzymes normally 

occurring in the colon. 
The composition as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
matrix core, and preferably also said cover layer, are 

based upon at least one polysaccharide selectively 
degradable by colonic enzymes. 
The composition as claimed in claim 2, wherein at least 
one of said enzymatically degradable polysaccharides forms 

a coacervate, preferably through polyvalent cation cross-linking. 
The composition as claimed in claim 2 or 3, wherein said 
enzyme degradable polysaccharide or polysaccharides are 

selected from the group consisting of pectins and salts and 
derivatives thereof. 
The composition as claimed in claim 3 or 4, wherein at 
least one of said matrix core and said cover layer, in 

addition to said coacervate forming polysaccharide or 
polysaccharides, comprises one or more colonic enzyme 

degradable polysaccharides which are not involved in the 
coacervate formation.

or more additional polysaccharides comprise dextrans and 

derivatives thereof. 
The composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein at least one of said matrix core and said cover

A method of preparing a colon selective pharmaceutical 
composition for oral administration, comprising the steps 

of (i) mixing at least one therapeutically active substance 
with a matrix material to prepare a matrix core having the 

active substance or substances dispersed therein, and (ii) 
coating said matrix core with a material without any active 

substance therein to provide the matrix core with a drug-free 
protective cover layer, said matrix and cover layer 

materials being based upon at least one substance which is

cation reactive polysaccharide complexed with said cation, 

said globules having said at least one therapeutically 
active component dispersed therein, and 
c) contacting the resulting coacervate globules with a 
third solution containing at least one cation reactive 

polysaccharide capable of being selectively degraded by 
enzymes in the colon, said polysaccharide or
