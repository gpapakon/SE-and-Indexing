<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with a mean value of a modulated light 
supplied from an optical modulator utilizing electro-optic 

effect, the drift amount of voltage·light output characteristics 
(an operative point voltage of the optical modulator) is 

obtained. When the operative point voltage becomes over E
CNT
 or 
below -E
CNT
, that is, it is out of a voltage range of -E
CNT
 to E
CNT
, 
a bias voltage is controlled to have a different polarity and a 

voltage difference which is less than a predetermined value from 
the operative point voltage. The direction of the DC drift 

is changed dependent on the polarity of the bias voltage. 
Therefore, the operative point voltage is maintained within a 

predetermined voltage range without suspending the communication 
operation by controlling the bias voltage as described above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an optical modulation
apparatus, and more particularly, to an apparatus for
compensating the occurrence of drift in voltage·light output
characteristics in an optical modulator.These days, an optical fiber communication system in
which information can be transmitted with high speed as compared
to a coaxial cable communication system has been introduced into
a market to meet the demand of transmitting a large capacity of
information. The modulation method presently used in an
optical fiber communication system is an optical direct
modulation method in which a drive current of a light source such
as a semiconductor laser, etc. is modulated to directly modulate
an intensity of an emitted light. In this direct modulation
method, there is limitation in amount of information to be
transmitted in a unit time, because the Chirping phenomenon is
not negligible when a modulation frequency becomes
high. For satisfying
demand of
transmitting a much more increased amount of information, an
optical modulator utilizing the electro-optic effect in which a
refractive index of a material is changed by applying an electric
field to the material has been researched and developed.Although an optical modulator in which high speed
modulation is possible to be carried out in principle, drift of
voltage·light output characteristics in which a light output
waveform is distorted occurs as operation of the modulation 
continues. As a result, demodulation is difficult to provide
a precise demodulated signal from a received light signal.In order to cope with the disadvantage of drift as
described above, a conventional optical modulation apparatus
comprising a mean value detecting circuit for calculating a mean
value of a modulated light from an optical modulator utilizing
the electro-optic effect, a voltage comparing circuit for
comparing the mean value with the reference voltage to provide
a difference signal therebetween, and a bias voltage generating
circuit for generating a bias voltage dependent on the difference
signal has been proposed.In the conventional optical modulation apparatus, the
bias voltage generated dependent on the difference signal is
added to a modulating signal, and an added signal thus obtained
is supplied to the optical modulator. In this operation, the
bias voltage is controlled to be coincident with an operative
point voltage of the optical modulator to suppress the distortion
in waveforms of output lights caused by the drift.Other than the above described conventional optical
