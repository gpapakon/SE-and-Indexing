<ABSTRACT>
A compound represented by general formula [I] or a salt thereof, being extremely reduced in the decomposability by gastric 

juice as compared with other known erythromycin derivatives and having an excellent activity of promoting the movement of digestive 
tracts, wherein R₁ represents hydrogen or acyl; R₂ and R₃ may be the same or different from each other and each represents 

hydrogen, hydroxy, acyloxy or amino, or alternatively R₂ and R₃ are combined together to represent =O or 
=NOR₁₀, wherein R₁₀ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; R₄ represents hydrogen or lower alkyl; and Y represents 

-NR₅R₆ or -N⁺R₇R₈R₉X⁻, wherein R₅, R₆, R₇, R₈ and R₉ may be the same or different from one another and each represents 
hydrogen, optionally substituted lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl or cycloalkyl, or a 3- to 7-membered heterocyclic 

group containing oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur as the heteroatom, and X represents an anion, provided that a pair of R₅ 
and R₆ and a pair of R₇ and R₈ may be each combined with the adjacent nitrogen atom to represent azacycloalkyl.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to erythromycin
derivatives and their salts which act to stimulate the
contractile motility of alimentary canals of mammals, and
are thus useful as stimulants for the contractile mobility
of alimentary canals.On the basis of differences in their mechanisms,
prokinetic agents are roughly classified into 4 groups:
direct cholinergic drugs such as aclatonium napadisilate;
indirect cholinergic drugs such as cisapride; dopamine
blockers such as domperidone; and opiate agonists such as
trimebutine maleate, and are widely used as therapeutic
agents for dysfunction of enterokinesis, particularly
for symptoms of digestive organs such as, for example,
gastrointestinal complaints due to hypokinesia. However,
these drugs have adverse effects such as extrapyramidal
symptoms or stimulation of prolactin release caused by the
dopamine blocking action. In addition, it is known that
the action of these drugs, which is different from that of
a spontaneous, physiological movement propagating from the
upper gastrointestinal tract to the lower gastrointestinal
tract, often leads to the onset of adverse effects such as
fluor, emesis or the like. On the other hand, motilin is known as a
gastrointestinal hormone which stimulates the contractile
motility of alimentary canals, but its supply by extraction
of natural sources or by chemical synthesis has not been
satisfactory, and thus a large supply thereof has been
difficult to secure. Further, motilin is a peptide
consisting of 22 amino acids, so the development of
an oral preparation comprising it has been difficult.In recent years, erythromycin and its derivatives
have been found to have a powerful stimulating activity
with respect to the contractile motility of alimentary
canals, and EM-523, one of the derivatives, is being
developed as a prokinetic agent (Japanese Patent Application
Disclosure SHO No. 60-218321, Japanese Patent Application
Disclosure SHO No. 61-87625, Japanese Patent Application
Disclosure SHO No. 63-99016, Japanese Patent Application
Disclosure SHO No. 63-99092 and The Journal of Pharmacology
and Experimental Therapeutics, vol. 251, No. 2, pp. 707-712,
1989).EM-523 is, however, unstable in the presence of an
acid, and therefore it is supposed that its action diminishes
due to the decomposition thereof by gastric acid when used
via oral administration. In view of these facts, we the
present inventors have conducted research in order to find
erythromycin derivatives which are acid resistant and capable
of being administered
