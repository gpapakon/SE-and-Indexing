<ABSTRACT>
Nitrogen retention in human subjects is promoted by administering  beta -hydroxy- beta -methylbutyric acid (HMB). The amount of HMB administered is effective to conserve protein as determined by reduction in urinary nitrogen. The method can be used with patients having a negative nitrogen balance due to disease conditions, and also with normal elderly persons who are subject to protein loss. The HMB may be administered orally or by intravenous infusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the promotion of
nitrogen retention in humans, and more particularly to
the administration of therapeutic agents for this
purpose.Tissue proteins forms the basis for organ
structure and function. Excessive losses of tissue
protein can compromise organ function and eventually
will result in death. Any stressful situation such as
trauma and chronic debilitating diseases results in
tissue losses that if sustained can compromise organ
function. In most cases nutrition alone cannot
prevent this tissue loss because of excessive
breakdown of tissue proteins. Thus alternatives to
nutrition must be used to abate or slow the protein
wasting or excessive loss of body nitrogen.Nitrogen balance is the difference between
the nitrogen intake (as protein or amino acids) in an
individual and the total nitrogen excretion. When the
nitrogen intake equals the nitrogen excretion, the
subject is in nitrogen equilibrium. If the nitrogen
intake exceeds the nitrogen excretion, the nitrogen
balance is positive, but if the nitrogen excretion is
greater than the nitrogen intake, the nitrogen balance
is negative. Nitrogen balance can be estimated by
monitoring urinary nitrogen. Absolute nitrogen
balance also requires fecal nitrogen measurement, but
in most cases this does not change appreciably unless
the diet is substantially altered. Thus, the nitrogen
content of urine can be approximately correlated with 
total nitrogen excretion. Monitoring nitrogen content
of urine is especially important where the patient has
or is expected to have a persistent negative nitrogen
balance.Promoting nitrogen retention has therapeutic
importance where the patient has been subjected to
trauma or stress conditions which can be expected to
induce potential loss. Injury (surgical, traumatic,
and burn) and sepsis result in accelerated protein
breakdown, which is manifested by increased nitrogen
loss. Catabolic conditions are also frequently
associated with severe bodily diseases such as cancer,
AIDS, etc. Loss of muscle protein may occur due to
normal aging, and consequently, protein sparing
therapy may be indicated for elderly patients who are
otherwise normal.Therapeutic agents and certain nutritional
regimes are known which can promote nitrogen
retention. However, therapeutic options to decrease
body nitrogen losses (protein wasting) are limited.
Injections of certain hormones may improve nitrogen
retention. Growth hormone injections can in the short
term at least decrease tissue protein losses: Horber
et al., J. Clin.

<CLAIMS>
Use of an effective amount of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyric acid (HMB) for the
preparation of a medicament for increasing the retention of nitrogen and for

protein sparing in a human subject, said HMB being in an edible or intravenously-administrable
form selected from (i) its free acid form; (ii) its sodium, potassium, or

calcium salt, (iii) its methyl or ethyl ester, or (iv) isovalaryl lactone.
The use of claims 1 in which said HMB is in the form of its calcium salt (Ca-HMB)
or its sodium salt (Na-HMB).
The use of claim 1 or 2 in which said effective amount of HMB is within the range
from 0.01 to 0.20 grams of said HMB based on its calcium salt per kilogram body

weight per 24 hours.
The use of claim 1 or 2 in which said effective amount of HMB is from 0.5 to 10
grams per 24 hours of said HMB based on its calcium salt.
The use of claims 1,2,3, or 4 in which said HMB is administered orally.
The use of claims 1,2,3,or 4 in which said HMB is administered intravenously.
The use of claims 1 or 2 in which said HMB is administered orally in an amount of
2 to 6 grams per 24 hours based on its calcium salt,
The use of claims 1 to 7 in which said human subject is an elderly person having
deficient protein nutrition, and said HMB is included in the daily diet of said

person.
