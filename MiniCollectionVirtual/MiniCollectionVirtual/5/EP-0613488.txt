<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polyacetal 
compositions having good wear resistance/sliding 
properties and also having good melt processing 
thermal stability. More specifically, it relates to 
polyacetal compositions containing at least one 
lubricant and at least one ethylene-based polymer. Polyacetal resins have been widely used in 
various sliding applications (such as bearing 
materials, gears, cams or conveyor chains). It is 
known that various solid and liquid lubricants, such 
as molybdenum disulfide, graphite, 
polytetrafluoroethylene, paraffin oil, fatty ester or 
silicone, are added into polyacetal resins to 
improve friction and wear properties in such sliding 
applications. However, it was found that solid 
lubricants did not achieve desired results and that 
liquid lubricants (as in, for example, U.S. patent 
3,808,133) caused an increase in screw retraction time 
due to slippage occurring during molding and extrusion 
processes. To improve the performance of polyacetal in 
sliding applications, polyethylene and polypropylene 
were added to polyacetal (U.S. patent 4,945,126). 
However, the resultant compositions frequently 
suffered from peeling or delamination on the surface 
of molded parts and further had poor heat stability. 
The inclusion of lubricants and ethylene vinyl acetate 
copolymer into polyacetal improved friction and wear 
properties of polyacetal (U.S. patent 4,041,002). 
However, such compositions were found to have poor 
heat stability since the acetate groups of the  
 
ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer were found to destabilizer polyacetal 
chains. EP 420,564 and EP 354,802 both disclose polyacetal compositions 
containing graft copolymers, said compositions having anti-friction and 
abrasion-resistance properties. However, neither reference discloses a 
means to create polyacetal compositions having good lubricity and wear 
resistance properties, along with good melt processing thermal stability 
properties. As such, there still exists a need to develop a polyacetal 
composition having not only good wear resistance properties, but also having 
good heat stability properties. In the present invention, there has been developed a polyacetal 
composition having good wear resistance and good melt processing thermal 
stability. Specifically, the compositions of the invention comprise 
(A) 80%-99% by weight of a polyacetal, (B) 0.5%-10% by weight of at least 
one lubricant, and (C) 0.5%-10% by weight of an ethylene-based random 
polymer of the formula E/X/Y wherein E is ethylene,
