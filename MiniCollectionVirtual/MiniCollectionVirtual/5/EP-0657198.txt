<ABSTRACT>
A fuel filter assembly (10) employs a base (20) which mounts a 
disposable filter cartridge (50). A pair of axial conduits (24,26) in the base 

(20) provide fluid communication between the base (20) and the cartridge 
(50). An axial sealing member (60) mounted in the cartridge (50) receives 

the axial conduits (24,26). An axial conduit (80) and preferably at least one 
baffle (88) positioned on the axial conduit outer surface within the cartridge 

(50) provide a flow path through the cartridge (50). An orifice (92) located 
in the cartridge axial conduit (80) provides a bleed vent which controls the 

size and flow rate of air bubbles in filtered fuel exiting the fuel filter. A 
flange-shaped end of the cartridge axial conduit (80) engages a ridge 

on the outside surface of the sealing member (60) to prevent the 
fuel flow from bypassing the baffle (88).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to devices for filtering and separating 
liquids. More particularly, the present invention relates to filters for the fuel 
supply system or lubricating oil of an internal combustion engine and 
removing foreign particles and separating water therefrom. The absence of high standards of quality control in diesel fuel supplies 
dictates that an effective fuel filter be incorporated into the fuel supply 
system of a diesel engine. It is not uncommon for diesel fuel to have 
significant quantities of abrasive particles and water. The abrasive particles 
present the potential for permanent damage to components of the fuel 
injection pump. The abrasive particles can also adversely affect the 
performance of the pump by destroying the ability of the fuel injection pump 
to precisely meter and deliver fuel at high pressures. The presence of water 
in the diesel fuel supply can cause corrosion of engine components, and 
during freezing conditions, can result in interruption of the fuel injection 
system and/or seizure of moving components. Similarly, water and 
particulate matter in the lubricating oil must be removed to minimize wear 
of engine parts. Commonly, filters employ a disposable filter cartridge which is 
replaced at pre-established intervals of filter usage. The cartridge is secured 
to a base assembly that is fixedly mounted to the engine header or some 
other fixed location. Current filter assemblies require a plurality of seals to seal the 
cartridge to the base assembly. The cartridge and base assembly are sealed 
to ensure that the fluid being filtered does not bypass the filter element in 
the cartridge. Additional seals may be employed to prevent short circuiting 
internal flow paths within the cartridge. The use of multiple seals increases 
the number of components, thereby increasing the cost of manufacture. In 
addition, the use of multiple seals increases the probability that a leak will 
occur. For most, if not all diesel fuel delivery systems, as fuel circulates 
through the fuel filter, air pockets are formed in the fuel filter. The air  
 
pockets normally form at the top of the fuel filter. Air bubbles tend to form 
in the fuel as a result of gassing when exposed to changes in pressure. For 
pressurized fuel delivery systems, the air pockets tend to disintegrate over 
time and/or the stream of bubbles present in the fuel is of a relatively small 
magnitude. The air pockets generally do not result in the formation of large 
air bubbles in the fuel
