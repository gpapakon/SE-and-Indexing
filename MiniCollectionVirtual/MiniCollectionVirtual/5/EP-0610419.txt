<CLAIMS>
Process for separating enantiomers by electro-migration 
in capillary columns, characterized in that 

chiral stationary phases are used which have been applied 
as a film and immobilized on the surfaces present in the 

separation system. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that immobilized [α, β or γ-6-permethylene (2,3,6-permethylcyclodextrin)peralkyl(aryl)polysiloxane]
 
(CHIRASIL 

DEX) is employed for the surface modification. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the hydroxyl groups of the cyclodextrin component 

are free or alkylated (unbranched, branched up to C₁₀₀) or 
acylated or perfluoroacylated (unbranched, branched up to 

C₁₀₀) and in that α, β, γ or δ-cyclodextrin is employed as 
the chiral system. 
Process according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the bonding of the cyclodextrin component to the 

polysiloxane is effected via a branched or unbranched 
alkylidene chain of arbitrary length. 
Process according to one of Claims 2 to 4, 
characterized in that the polysiloxane components, whose 

organic radicals can be all previously known radicals 

(alkyls or aryls, functionalized or nonfunctionalized), 
have been immobilized on silica surfaces (glass, fused 

silica or silica gel). 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the chiral stationary phase film is 

either created by applying [α-, β- or γ-6-permethylene(2,3,6-permethylcyclodextrin)peralkyl(aryl)polysiloxane]  

 
(CHIRASIL DEX), or arises as a result of on-column-reactions 

of cyclodextrin-containing reactive structural 
components.
