<ABSTRACT>
Organometallic complexes of lanthanides with a 
well-defined stoichiometry which can be used in the 

stereospecific polymerization of unsaturated monomers, 
can be represented by the general formula:



Me(OR)₃*(Me₁R¹R²R³)
x



 
wherein, Me represents a metal with atomic number 21, 

39, or an atomic number between 57 and 71, OR is an 
alkoxylic group of an alcohol; Me represents a metal of 

the group IIIB, whereas R¹, R², R³ can be H, or a 
linear, branched or cyclo-aliphatic alkyl radical 

containing from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and x is an 
integer (3 or 4) and depends on the type of alkoxide 

used.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new organometallic
complexes of elements belonging to the group of
lanthanides, their preparation and their use in the
stereospecific polymerization of unsaturated monomers.It is known in the art that the salts of metals
belonging to the group of lanthanides, together with
alkyls of metals belonging to the main groups from 1 to
3 of the periodic table and in the presence of halogenating
agents, can form active catalytic systems in the
Ziegler-Natta type polymerization reaction of both
olefinic and diolefinic unsaturated monomers.The systems are among the most stereospecific and
active for the 1,4-cis polymerization of butadiene and
in addition the elastomer produced has better mechanical
properties than those of the polybutadienes produced
with other catalytic systems.A vast collection of examples of ternary catalytic 
systems based on metal salts of the group of lanthanides
is provided in the publication by G. Allen and J.
Bevington "Comprehensive Polymer Science" Vol. 4,
chapter 5 page 53, published by Pergamon Press in 1989.Other particularly detailed references can be
found in the articles appearing in the magazines
Inorganica Chimica Acta, vol. 130 page 125 of 1987 and
Polymer, vol. 29, page 1516 of 1988.A metal belonging to the group of lanthanides
refers, as is generally accepted in the known art, to
a metal belonging to the group comprising: scandium,
with atomic number 21, yttrium, having atomic number
39, and/or a metal having an atomic number between that
of lanthanum (57) and that of lutetium (71); these
metals belong to group IIIA of the periodic table,
according to the IUPAC definition prior to 1985.From the point of view of patents, valid examples
of ternary catalytic systems based on lanthanides are
represented by German patents DE 1.812.935, DE
2.833.721, DE 2.848.964 and DD 243.034. Further, EP-A-0 076 535 discloses a catalytic
system and a process for preparing conjugated diolefin
polymers or copolymers having a high content of
1,4-cis units, which catalytic system is prepared from
a compound of a metal of Group III B of the Periodic
System having an atomic number of between 21 and 103,
an organic halogen derivative, and an aluminium
alkylhydrid or trialkyl.In most of the above cases, the catalytic systems
are prepared by mixing the three components directly in
the presence of the unsaturated compound to be polymerized,
a method known in the art as "in situ preparation
of the catalytic mixture". Another technique of the known art involves the
preparatio
