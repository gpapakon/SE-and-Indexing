<ABSTRACT>
Of lenses constituting an f·ϑ lens, with respect to the 
lens L2 having a greatest difference between absolute values 

of surface power at both surfaces thereof, a convex surface 
having a greater absolute value of surface power is made to 

abut through line contact against columnar abutment members 
projecting from the optical housing 10 perpendicularly to the 

scanning direction. In addition, flat portions provided at 
both ends of the lens in the scanning direction thereof are 

supported by supporting members, and the lens is affixed to 
the abutment members and by means of leaf springs.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a structure for
attaching a scanning optical system, and more particularly to
a structure for attaching a scanning optical system in which a
scanning optical system in an optical scanning device used in
a laser printer or the like is attached to an optical housing.As an attaching structure in which a scanning optical
system in a conventional scanning optical system, which is
employed widely in copying machines, laser printers, and the
like, is attached to an optical housing, Japanese Patent
Examined Publication No. Hei 3-56449 proposes attaching
structures including the following: an attaching structure
wherein flat portions are respectively formed in side portions
of both surfaces of each of a biconcave lens, a meniscus lens,
and a biconvex lens, and the flat portions are clamped by a
holding member and a pressing member so as to attach the lenses
to the optical housing, as well as an attaching structure
wherein flat portions are respectively formed in side portions
of one surface of each of a biconcave lens, a meniscus lens,
and a biconvex lens, and each flat portion is held by a holding
member while the other surface is pressed at one or a plurality
of points by a pressing member or pressing members so as to 
attach the lenses to the optical housing. If a flat portion is
formed on at least one surface of each lens, the flat portion
can be brought into surface contact with the holding member, so
that each lens can be positioned and held accurately. However,
there are cases where it is difficult to form flat portions in
such biconcave, meniscus lens, and biconvex lenses. Meanwhile,
as shown in Fig. 6(a), with respect to a planoconcave lens or
a planoconvex lens, there is no need to newly form a flat
portion for being held by a holding member, and since a flat
surface is already provided, if the flat surface is held by
holding members 52 and 54, the lens can be positioned and held
simply and accurately.However, in the attaching structure for attaching to
the optical housing the scanning lens constituted by the
aforementioned planoconcave lens or planoconvex lens, since a
flat surface S3 of a planoconvex lens, such as the one shown in
Fig. 6(a), is held by the holding members 52 and 54, in the
event that a convex surface S4 of the lens has changed from the
convex surface S4 to a convex surface S4' due to a variation in
the thickness of the lens owing to a production error, the
direction of emergence of the laser beam from the lens changes
from a direction B1 to a
