the multi-layer floor covering 5 has layers or foils,
characterised in that one layer consists of a transparent

upper foil, has a layer thickness of 80 to 1000 µm,
consists of a polyolefine-containing synthetic material

mixture of 20 to 80 wt.% of a polyethylene of very low
density (VLDPE) with a melt index MFI (190°C/2.16 kg)

of up to 10 g/10 min and 20 to 80 wt.% of a polypropylene
co-polymer with a co-monomer content of up to 12% and

contains up to 4 wt.% of processing adjuvants, which
upper foil is connected via a transparent sealing layer,

which consists of VLDPE or of a polyolefine mixture of
0 - 50 wt.% LLDPE and 50 - 100 wt.% VLDPE and possesses

a layer thickness of 5 to 500 µm, with an intermediate
part which consists of a highly-filled polyolefine or of

a highly-filled polyolefine mixture with a layer thickness
of up to 3 mm, whereby the proportion of filling

material accounts for up to 60 wt.%, or also cork sheets
or cork strips or also of a foamed substrate based on

EVA, whereby the intermediate part is connected via a
second transparent sealing layer of the above-given

composition with an underpart which consists of a filling
material containing polyolefine mixture with a layer

thickness of up to 500 µm, whereby the mixture consists
of up to 60 wt.% of a statistical co-polymer of a polypropylene

with a melt index MFI (230°C/2.16 kg) of

<
 than 11 g/10 min and a co-monomer content of 
<
 than 10%
with up to 45 wt.% of a co-polymer of an ethylene-acrylic

acid ester based on EBA or EMA with an ester
content of up to 40% and/or of a terpolymer of an acrylic

acid ester with a co-monomer content of up to 40% and/or
of a co-polymer of a polypropylene with maleic acid

anhydride and/or of a co-polymer of a polyethylene with 
maleic acid anhydride with a melt index MFI (230°C/2.16 kg)

of up to 30 g/10 min and up to 60 wt.% of a
mineral filling material or filling material mixture,

consisting of aluminium hydroxide and/or magnesium
hydroxide with an average grain diameter of up to 35 µm

and processing adjuvants based on stericly-hindered
phenols and/or phosphites and metal salts of carboxylic

acids, especially magnesium stearate.
Floor covering according to claim 1, characterised
in that the VLDPE of the synthetic material mixture of

the upper foil has a melt index of 0.3 to 7 g/10 min and
this synthetic material mixture contains a proportion of

30 to 40 wt.% of polypropylene co-polymer with a co-monomer
content of 4 to 8%.
Floor covering according to claim 1, characterised
in that the intermediate part is a mixture of up to

65 wt.%, preferably 40 to 60 wt.%, of a co-polymer of an
ethylene-acrylic acid ester based on EBA or EMA with an

ester content of up to 40% with up to 10 wt.%, preferably
5 to 8 wt.%, of an HDPE with a density of 
>
 0.940 g/cm
3

and a melt index MFI (190°C/21.6 kg) of below 10 g/10 min
or possibly with a VLDPE with a density of 
>
 0.915 g/cm
3

and a melt index MFI (190°C/2.16 kg) between 1.0 and
10 g/min, as well as of a mineral filling material or

filling material mixture, consisting of aluminium
hydroxide and/or magnesium hydroxide with an average

grain diameter of up to 35 µm, preferably 1.0 to 15 µm,
and up to 2 wt.% of processing adjuvants based on

stericly-hindered phenols and/or phosphites and metal
salts of carboxylic acids, especially magnesium stearate,

and possibly in addition up to 20 wt.% of colour
components.
Floor covering according to claim 1, characterised
in that the lower part is a mixture of 30 to 50 wt.% of

a statistical co-polymer of a polypropylene with a melt 
index MFI (230°C/2.16 kg) of 2 to 8 g/10 min and a

co-monomer content of 3 to 5% with 25 to 35 wt.% of a
co-polymer of an ethylene-acrylic acid ester based on

EBA or EMA with an ester content of up to 40% and/or
of a terpolymer of an acrylic acid ester with a

co-monomer content of up to 40% and/or of a co-polymer
of a polypropylene with maleic acid anhydride and/or of

a co-polymer of a polyethylene with maleic acid anhydride
with a melt index MFI (230°C/2.16 kg) of up to 30 g/10

min and 20 to 25 wt.% of a mineral filling material
or filling material mixture, consisting of aluminium

hydroxide and/or magnesium hydroxide with an average
