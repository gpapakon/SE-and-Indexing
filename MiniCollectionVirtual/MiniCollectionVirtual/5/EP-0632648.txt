<ABSTRACT>
A two-dimensional image is created by scanning 
a sensor array, consisting of a line of image detectors, 

in a direction perpendicular to the array. The image 
consisting of m rows of n pixels is stored in a memory 2. 

The image is scanned by counters 3 and 4 to select the 
(i)th pixel of row j and the data V
ij
 is output on bus 5 to 
arithmetic means 10. Arithmetic means 8 and 9 calculate 

mean values of data output from neighbouring pixels h and 
these mean values are compared with the data V
ij
 in 
arithmetic means 10 to determine any variation in 

sensitivity Δi. Δi is stored in memory 11 and added as 
a correction to the stored data through calculator 

12 and data bus 20.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image 
processing apparatus used in association with image 
detecting apparatus such as X-ray image detecting 
apparatus, for medical and industrial use. The latest type of X-ray image detecting 
apparatus is provided with a one-dimensional sensor array 
which includes a plurality of image detectors of 
semiconductor. The sensor array is scanned perpendicular 
thereto so as to obtain a two-dimensional image. In 
addition, a memory is provided for storing the two-dimensional 
image by arranging pixel data output by the 
image detectors in a predetermined pattern. This type of image detecting apparatus has a 
problem in that if the sensor array includes a defective 
image detector having a reduced sensitivity, the image 
produced by the defective detector is spoiled by a line 
noise. If the defective image detector amounts to be 
more than one, or alternatively, if the extent of unequal 
sensitivity depends upon temperature, it is difficult to 
adjust all the image detectors so as to have equal 
sensitivity. The present invention is to provide an image 
processing apparatus usable in association with image 
detecting apparatus in order to remove a line noise likely 
to occur because of unequal sensitivity between image 
detectors which constitute the sensor array. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an apparatus for processing a two-dimensional 
image obtained by scanning a sensor array of image 
detectors in a direction perpendicular to the array, the 
apparatus comprising an image memory for storing the two-dimensional 
image formed by pixel data output from the 
image detectors of the sensor array, a first read-out  
 
means for reading the stored pixel data resulting from a 
particular detector of the array, a second read-out means 
for reading the stored pixel data resulting from a 
neighbouring detector or detectors, a first arithmetic 
means for measuring the magnitude of the difference in 
sensitivity between the detector whose pixel data is read 
by the first read-out means and the detector(s) whose 
pixel data is read by the second read-out means, and a 
second arithmetic means for compensating for any 
deficiency of sensitivity in the particular detector on 
the basis of the output of the first arithmetic means. Pixel data output by the image detectors is 
linearly arranged and stored in the memory, and the first 
read-out means reads the pixel data wholly or partially 
from the memory. Then the second read-out memory reads 
another pixel
