<ABSTRACT>
Shower sitting structure (1) comprising a frame and seat support elements (2, 3) forming seat support surfaces for supporting a user's body, in which the seat support elements (2, 3) are designed in such a way that support is present only under the thighs in front of the ischial tuberosities, in which there is no support at the position of the perineum, and in which a backrest element (3), which at its bottom end forms a supporting part (38), for the lower back region of the user is present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a shower sitting structure, comprising a frame and
seat support elements forming seat support surfaces for
supporting a user's body, in which the seat support
elements comprise two thigh supporting parts disposed
symmetrically on either side of a vertical plane and having
rear regions and front regions, the front regions being
designed to support parts of the user's thighs nearer the
knee, and the seat support elements being formed in such a
way that in the region where the user's buttocks will lie
during use, they form an essentially horizontal free
passage from back to front to the perineum, the structure
further comprising a back support element for the back
regions of a user which back support element at its bottom
end forms a supporting part for the region of the user's
back in the vicinity of the sacrum.Such a shower sitting structure is known from FR-A
16044. The structure disclosed therein is provided with
seat support elements which are essentially located at and
support only the hollow of the knee. The body weight being
supported by small areas leads to high, unpleasant
pressures.A similar a shower sitting structure is also known
from US-A-3,730,590 and is intended in particular for users
who have one or more physical disabilities as a result of
illness or age, and require a support temporarily or all
the time while they are taking a shower.The abovementioned users can be old people or
people suffering from diseases such as rheumatism,
Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, paraplegia,
muscular diseases, hemiplegia etc., or people who have
become handicapped as the result of an accident. Many of
these users can stand up only for a short time, or cannot
stand at all, and will therefore have to take their shower
sitting down. Other users need a shower seat support only
for certain actions, and for yet other users the seat 
support is not necessary, but it can provide a comfortable
rest point while taking the shower. By sitting on a shower
seat support, the users, who are often limited in their
movements through a handicap or age, will be more likely to
be able to carry out certain washing operations themselves,
which gives them a greater sense of well-being and also
means that there is less call for a carer.One problem connected with the use of a seat
support when taking a shower is that the parts of the body
on which the user is resting are less accessible for
washing. A carer is therefore more likely to be needed to
give assistance in the washing.The shower sitting

Shower sitting structure, comprising a frame and
seat support elements forming seat support surfaces for

supporting a user's body, in which the seat support
elements comprise two thigh supporting parts disposed

symmetrically on either side of a vertical plane and
having rear regions and front regions, the front regions

being designed to support parts of the user's thighs
nearer the knee, and the seat support elements being

formed in such a way that in the region where the user's
buttocks will lie during use, they form an essentially

horizontal free passage from back to front to the
perineum, the structure further comprising a back support

element for the back regions of a user which back support
element at its bottom end forms a supporting part for the

region of the user's back in the vicinity of the sacrum,
characterized in that the rear regions (31,32) of the

thigh supporting parts (29,30,31,32) form the rear edges
(33,34) of the seat support surfaces and in that the rear

regions (31,32) of the thigh supporting parts
(29,30,31,32) extend up until short of the buttocks and

do not extend under the ischial tuberosities of a user.
Shower sitting structure according to claim 1,
characterized in that the seat support surfaces of the

thigh supporting parts (29,30,31,32) in the rear regions
(31,32) and in the front regions (29,30) form an obtuse,

downward opening angle (α) of 160°-180°.
Shower sitting structure according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the seat support elements (2) in

top view assume an essentially U-shaped form, opening
backwards.
Shower sitting structure according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the thigh supporting parts 

(29,30,31,32) merge into each other (26) at the position
of the vertical plane.
Shower sitting structure according to Claim 1,
characterized by means, preferably hinge means

(15,16,17,18), for folding up the seat support elements
(2;).
