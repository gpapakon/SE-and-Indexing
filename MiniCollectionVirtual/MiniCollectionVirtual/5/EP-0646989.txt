<ABSTRACT>
An electrical contact (2) has an inner contact member 
(4) and an outer assist spring (6) where backup spring 

arms (24) of the assist spring (6) press against 
cantilever beam spring arms (10a and 10b) to increase 

contact pressure on an inserted tab. The cantilever beam 
spring arm (10a) includes two contact points at (34) with 

an intermediate shallow section (36) whereas the 
cantilever beam spring arm (10b) includes a single contact 

point at (32). This configuration provides three distinct 
contact points for an inserted tab, and increases the 

contact force against an inserted tab contact.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates to an improved 
electrical terminal, and in particular, to terminals 
having increased contact force added by an additional 
back-up spring. It is known to have electrical terminals which 
include an inner contact portion having opposed contact 
arms formed by cantilever beams, where a back-up spring or 
an assist spring is included having back-up spring arms 
which increase the contact force on the opposed contact 
arms for increasing the contact pressure to a mating tab 
terminal. In these known electrical contacts, single 
cantilever beam spring arms extend forwardly having a 
generally flat arm configuration along the vertical axis. 
It is difficult to achieve however, a perfect planar 
contact between the cantilever beam surfaces and the 
surfaces of the tabs to achieve an adequate electrical 
contact. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved electrical contact having multiple 
points of contact. It is a further object of the invention to provide an 
electrical terminal having an increased contact force 
against a tab inserted therein. The objects of the invention have been accomplished 
by providing a cantilever beam contact member having 
contact arms extending forwardly from a body portion and 
having a constricted portion forming opposed contact 
portions. The contact member is characterized in that one 
of the contact beam arms are formed with more than one 
contact point at the same axial distance and the opposite 
cantilever beam has a contact point intermediate the 
contact points on the other contact beam arm. An embodiment of the invention will now be described  
 
by way of reference to the drawings where; 
Figure 1 is a side plan view of a preferred 
embodiment of the contact member; Figure 2 is an upper plan view of the contact member 
of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a cross-sectional view through lines 3-3 
of Figure 1; and Figure 4 is a front view of the inner contact portion 
shown after formation of the opposed contacts, but prior 
to forming the inner contact with the contact arms in an 
opposed relation. With reference first to Figures 1 and 2, an 
electrical contact is shown at 2 comprising an inner 
contact portion 4 and an outer assist spring 6. The inner 
contact member 4 is comprised of a forward contacting 
section 8 formed by cantilever beam spring arms 10a and 
10b which extend from a central portion 12. A wire crimp 
section 14 extends from an opposite end of the 
intermediate portion 12 and strain relief arms 16

<CLAIMS>
A cantilever beam contact member (4) having contact 
arms (10a, 10b) extending forwardly from a body portion 

(12), and having a constricted portion forming opposed 
contact portions (30a, 30b), the contact member (4) being 

characterized in that one of said contact beam arms (10a) 
is formed with more than one contact point (34) at the 

same axial distance, and said opposite cantilever beam 
member (10b) has a contact point (32) intermediate said 

contact points (34) on said other contact beam arm (10a).
