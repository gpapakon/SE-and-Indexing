<ABSTRACT>
Improved door for oven in which the door 1 is formed 
by crystals 2 and 3, being the punched sheet 4 in 

between, having a series of holes 5. 
So, the air at environmental temperature next to the 
lower side of the door 1, will come in through the 

lower holes 6, and will go out through the upper holes 
8 and 7, producing the free circulation by its gravity 

a cooling on the outside crystal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The following invention, as stated in the heading of 
this descriptive memory, is composed of an improved 
door for oven, to be used in conventional ovens, with 
resistances, heating by radiation and being able to 
incorporate a turbine that makes hot air and grill go 
around in order to cook. A Doors of this type is disclosed in the US-A-1 552 849. The improvements introduced in the oven door are aimed 
to get a significant reduction in the temperature 
reaching its outside crystal, by complying with the 
standards and trying to avoid future accidents. When a manufacturer is going to put a product on sale, 
he bears in mind the combination of several factors, 
such as aesthetics, safety, its service and quality of 
materials, as well as cleanliness, in the case of 
conventional ovens. In other words, the purpose is to 
obtain not only an aesthetic but also a reliable 
product. It is well known the disadvantage existing in the doors 
of conventional ovens, as a result of the hot 
temperatures reached when the oven is working, which 
means burns by touching them, especially when children 
are involved, since the oven is usually located at low 
height, and this makes children accidentally lean their 
hands on the door. That is the reason why we have tried to obtain a 
product that, apart from complying with the existing 
safety standards and combining the relationship 
aesthetics-safety, allows to eliminate this 
inconvenience, and therefore the oven door has been 
formed by two crystals, leaving a free space in between 
to allow the circulation of the air, which circulates 
by means of an electro- fan creating a stream of air 
between the two crystals. This solution is highly expensive due to the 
incorporation of an electro-fan and, besides, the 
introduction of polluted air coming from the 
surroundings of the oven, with grease, produces more 
dirtiness in the crystal.  
 In this memory, we describe a door for conventional 
ovens where, between the two crystals forming it, there 
is a sheet punched all over its surface, with several 
holes of different diameters, preferably between 3 and 
6 mm. In this way, the air of the environment, at a 
temperature lower than the air of the oven, comes in 
the door through its lower side and goes out through 
its upper side, and that circulation produces, just by 
the gravity of the air, the absorption of heat by the 
grid of the punched sheet, which acts as a screen, and 
this means an important reduction in the temperature of 
the outside crystal of the oven

<CLAIMS>
DOOR FOR OVEN, to be used in conventional 
ovens, with resistances, heating by radiation and being 

able to incorporate a turbine and grill, the door being 
formed by two crystals (2,3), characterized because 

between the two crystals forming the door, there is a 
punched sheet (4) having, all over its surface, several 

holes of diameter between 3 and 6 mm. preferably, 
having foreseen that the cold air circulates by gravity 

from holes (6) arranged in the lower side of the door entrance to 
holes (8,7) arranged in the upper side of the door.
