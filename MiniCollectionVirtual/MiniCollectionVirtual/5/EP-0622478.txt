<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a process for electroplating a layer of a coating of a zinc-based metal alloy, of the ZnX type, X being the second element of this alloy, onto a surface of a steel substrate. The process consists in depositing, between the surface of the substrate and the layer of coating of the said alloy, an undercoat layer of the said alloy with a percentage of the second element X such that the reduction potential of the said alloy of the said undercoat layer with respect to a saturated-calomel electrode is greater than or equal to or substantially less than the potential for hydrogen evolution on the steel of the substrate, in order to obtain the desired percentage of the second element X. The subject of the invention is also a coated steel material comprising a steel substrate and a coating layer of a zinc-based metal alloy.
