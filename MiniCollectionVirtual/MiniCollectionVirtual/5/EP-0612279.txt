Clamping device for connecting a tool head (11) with a 
tool holder (10) on machine tools, with a changeable tool 

head (11) which is provided with a cylindrical or at least 
partly conical receiving bore (15) which fits with a 

complementary matching pin (13), whereby the tool 
holder (10) and the tool head (11) can be clamped together 

by a clamping shaft (17) rotatable about its longitudinal 
axis (46),
 
characterized in that
 
the clamping shaft (17) is locked in the clamped position 

by switchable unidirectional clutch (31 to 38) as a pawl 
stop which is locked against rotating in the loosening 

direction and that the clutch (31 to 38) can be unlocked 
to release the tool head (11) from the locked condition by 

a movable machine element (39). 
Clamping device according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the clutch is a radial clamping-body overrunning 

clutch (31 to 38) where the clamping shaft (17) is 
constituted as a drive head with recesses (33) tapering in 

the rotation direction, the clamping shaft (17) being 
surrounded radially outside the bore (32) in which it is 

running, each of the recesses (33) having at its shallow 
end an opening (36) with respect to which the machine 

element (39) can be positioned so that the clamping-body 
or bodies (34) can be pushed into the broader part(s) of 

the recess (33) thereby releasing the locking effect. 
Clamping device according to claim 2, characterized in 
that an end of the clamping shaft (17) has one or more 

star-shaped openings (38) which extend to the region of 
the recesses (33) and that a clamping key (39) is 

insertable or releasably inserted into these 
openings (38).  

 
Clamping device according to claim 3, characterized in 
that three angularly equispaced recesses (33) and a 

triangle-starshaped opening (38) partially overlying it 
are provided. 
Clamping device according to claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the opening (38) has in the region of the 

longitudinal axis (46) or the clamping shaft (17) a 
coaxial centering bore overlapping the triangle-starshaped 

edge regions (38) and in which is iserted or releasably 
engaged a centering pin (43) which projects as a part of 

the insert key (39) the star-shaped projection (42), in 
the rest corresponding with the opening. 
Clamping device according to one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the insert key (39) arranged is 

axially displaceable in relation to the clamping 
shaft (17) against resilience and is arranged with rotary 

play with respect to the clamping shaft (17). 
Clamping device according to claim 6, characterized in 
that the insert key (39) can rotate relative to the 

clamping shaft trough 5° to 20°. 
Clamping device according to one of claims 3 to 7, 
characterized in that the clamping bodies are rollers or 

balls (34). 
Clamping device according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the opening (36) is formed as a roller or ball 

seat (37)
