<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for indirect agglutination immunoassay in which
agglutination being caused by an antigen-antibody reaction is
assayed using magnetic particles or magnetic-material-containing
particles that have an antigen or antibody bound
thereto.The inventors of the present invention previously
proposed an effective method and apparatus for indirect
agglutination immunoassay as U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
08/082,373 "INDIRECT AGGLUTINATION IMMUNOASSAY AND APPARATUS
THEREFOR" filed on June 28, 1993 which is a Continuation-in-Part
Application of U.S. Patent Application Serial No.
07/606,205 filed on October 31, 1990. These applications generally correspond to EP-A-0 426 170. According to the method,
a solution of the particles of a specified reagent is added and
mixed with a diluted solution of a specified sample in each of
wells with a U- or V-shaped bottom in a micro plate and, after
some reaction, components including the particles are
precipitated in the bottom of each well by magnetic force and,
subsequently, the micro plate is inclined to judge the 
occurrence of an immunoreaction in view of the profile of
separation of the precipitated particles from the wells.The precipitation patterns that are to be formed in the
method of indirect agglutination immunoassay due to the flow of
the particles in the micro plate are roughly divided into three
types: i) a reaction-positive precipitation pattern that
results from the bonding among particles due to an
immunoreaction and which is characterized by stationary
particles that do not move but which remain as a spot in the
bottom of each well even if the micro plate is inclined; ii) a
reaction-negative precipitation pattern that results from the
non-binding among particles due to the absence of an
immunoreaction and which is characterized by free-flowing
particles that, upon inclination of the micro plate, flow down
to the side wall of each well; and iii) a precipitation pattern
intermediate between i) and ii).The precipitation patterns due to the flow of the
particles that are formed in the bottoms of wells in a micro
plate can be read by various methods such as taking a picture
of the micro plate from above with a TV camera or,
alternatively, using a line sensor and taking a picture of the
precipitation patterns due to the flow of the particles by
image processing techniques for measuring the flow lengths of
the respective patterns due to the flow of the particles so 
that they can be correlated to the
