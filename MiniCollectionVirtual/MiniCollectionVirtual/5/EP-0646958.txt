<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor package (100) and module (300) includes 
a unitary base structure (101) and alignment mechanisms 

(104). The unitary base structure (101) includes a 
semiconductor mounting area (102) and encircling walls (103). 

The structure provides resistance to bowing as compared to a 
flat base. The lack of bowing provides improved thermal 

contact to a cold plate of the operating environment. The lack 
of bowing also reduces certain failure modes. The alignment 

mechanism (104) aligns module components during assembly, 
thereby simplifying assembly by eliminating the need for 

complicated fixtures which hold components in place.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to 
semiconductor packages and modules, and more particularly, to 
semiconductor packages and modules comprising unitary base 
structures. In the past, semiconductor device modules such as high 
power switching modules have comprised a large flat stamped 
metallic heatsink at the bottom of the module. The stamped 
heatsink provides support for the remainder of the components 
of the module and provides the thermal interface between the 
module and a cold plate in the operating environment. The flat 
stamped heatsink of the conventional semiconductor module 
gives rise to certain substantial disadvantages. Because the stamped flat heatsink does not encircle or 
enclose the remainder of the module components, there is no 
convenient way for the remainder of the module components to 
be positioned during fabrication of the module. Typically, 
complicated fixtures are used to hold components in place 
while the module is assembled. Furthermore, the stamped flat heatsink is highly 
susceptible to bowing due to mismatches in thermal 
coefficients of other portions of the module and also due to 
stresses induced when the module is mounted on the cold plate 
of the operating environment. When the module is bowed it 
does not mate well with the cold plate of the operating 
environment. What is needed is a semiconductor package and module 
structure which does not rely on complicated fixturing during  
 
assembly and which resists bowing along the bottom surface of 
the module. FIG. 1 is a perspective view illustrating a semiconductor 
package in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the 
present invention; FIG. 2 is a cross-section view of the package shown in 
FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a partially assembled 
semiconductor module in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention; and FIG. 4 is a cross-section view of the module of FIG. 3, 
further illustrating module components. Generally, the present invention provides a method and 
apparatus for fabricating a semiconductor package and module. 
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a metal 
unitary enclosing structure, or box, for a power module. The 
box acts as a heatsink and can be fashioned with integral slots, 
pins, etc. to provide alignment for the components comprising 
the power module. Consequently, complicated fixturing for 
holding components in place during assembly is not required. 
Furthermore, since the heatsink is an enclosing structure, or 
box, it is
