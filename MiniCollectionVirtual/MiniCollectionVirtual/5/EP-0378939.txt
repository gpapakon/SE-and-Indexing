<ABSTRACT>
Rotary seal with integrated magnetic coder, especially for rolling bearings with information sensors, of the type comprising a packing (8) with sealing lips, over moulded over a ring (7) and bearing on another ring (17), the said rings each being provided with a cylindrical mounting surface and to which coder and sensor elements are respectively connected, characterised in that the coder element (20) possesses means (21) for axial, radial and angular retention, and an abutment surface (26) respectively with a function of fastening onto a cylindrical bearing surface (24) of the packing (8), and of positioning against an abutment surface (23) of the said packing, the two abutment surfaces respectively facing each other.

A rotary annular sealing joint with an integrated magnetic 
encoder, in particular for bearings with information sensors of the type 

comprising a gasket (8) with sealing lips duplicate moulded on a ring (7) and 
bearing on a further ring (17), these rings each being provided with a 

cylindrical assembly seat and with which an annular encoder member (20) and 
a sensor member (18) are respectively rigid, characterized in that the 

encoder member (20) comprises lugs (21) distributed peripherally over a 
cylindrical surface forming the encoder member (20), the lugs having a first 

flank (25, 27) extending radially, or radial flank, and a second inclined flank, 
in that the immobilization and axial positioning of the encoder member (20) 

are carried out in an axial direction by a radially extending stop surface (23) 
borne by the gasket (8) and by a radially extending stop surface (26) borne by 

the encoder member (20), these two surfaces (23, 26) facing one another, the 
immobilization and axial positioning of the encoder member (20) in the other 

axial direction and angular and radial retention being assured by the lugs (21) 
fitted elastically in a cylindrical seat (24) of the gasket (8) by means of the 

radial flanks (25, 27) of these lugs (21), these radial flanks (25, 27) being 
axially remote from the radial stop surfaces (23, 26). 
A rotary sealing joint as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the lugs (21) retaining the encoder member (20) are distributed 

peripherally about the periphery of the ring (22) forming the encoder 
member. 
A rotary sealing joint as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the lugs (21) retaining the encoder member (20) are distributed 

peripherally within the ring (22) forming the encoder member. 
A rotary sealing joint as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the lugs (21) retaining the encoder member (20) are  

 
fitted in the sealing gasket (8) to allow the latter to take up, through its 

elasticity, the radial play and gripping of the encoder member (20) in its 
housing and the absorption of impacts and vibrations likely to disconnect the 

encoder from the gasket. 
A sealing joint as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the sensor member (18) is fitted in the outer surface of 

an assembly ring (17) borne on by the sealing lips (9, 10; 13, 14, 15) of the 
gasket (8) duplicate moulded on a further assembly ring (7). 
A sealing joint as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that it is mounted in a wheel bearing of a vehicle. 
A sealing joint as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the sensor member (18) and its supply cable (19) are 

connected by hooking on the outer surface of the assembly ring (17).
