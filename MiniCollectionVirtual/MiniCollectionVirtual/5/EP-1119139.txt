<ABSTRACT>
A method, apparatus, and system for providing dynamic
host configuration protocol (DHCP) tagging for

employing a DHCP server as a non-volatile repository.
In one embodiment, the method includes tagging one or

more messages from a client computer to the DHCP server
with a media access control (MAC) address of a cable

modem that is attached to the client computer for
storing the MAC address as part of a lease record in

the DHCP server. The method further includes receiving
a request for the MAC address of the cable modem based

on the Internet protocol (IP) address of the client
computer from a remote device for transmitting packets

to the client computer, obtaining the MAC address of
the cable modem corresponding to the IP address of the

client computer from the DHCP server, and transmitting
the MAC address to the remote device. Consequently,

the client computer's traffic through the remote device
is directed to the client computer's cable modem.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of
computer networks, and specifically, to network
forwarding using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
(DHCP) tagging.The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP),
published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
as Request for Comment (RFC) 2131 in March 1997
[hereinafter referred to as "the DHCP specification"],
was created to facilitate automatic assignment/leasing
of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to clients when
such clients log on to TCP/IP networks. The contents
of the DHCP specification are fully incorporated herein
by reference. A DHCP server centrally manages the
assignment and reassignment of unused IP addresses.In a subscriber network system such as a cable modem
system, IP addresses are assigned by the DHCP server to
subscribers via a shared physical medium. The cable
modems used by subscribers also include a media access
control (MAC) address. To send packets to a subscriber
from a web server, the IP address of the subscriber
must be translated into a MAC address. This is
typically done using an Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP), as defined in request for comment (RFC) 826,
entitled "An Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol",
Published in November 1982, where an ARP request is
broadcasted for the unknown address. However, ARP 
requests introduce the possibility of spoofing
(hacking).The present invention comprises a method for a device
in a system including a server and one or more client
computers. In one embodiment, the method includes
tagging one or more messages from a client computer to
the server with a media access control (MAC) address of
a cable modem that is attached to the client computer
for storing the MAC address as part of a lease record
in the server. The method further includes receiving a
request for the MAC address of the cable modem based on
the Internet protocol (IP) address of the client
computer from a remote device for transmitting packets
to the client computer, obtaining the MAC address of
the cable modem corresponding to the IP address of the
client computer from the server, and transmitting the
MAC address to the remote device.Other embodiments are described and claimed herein.Figure 1 shows a block diagram of an exemplary
subscriber network system that utilizes a DHCP server.
Figure 2 shows a message flow diagram of packet
exchanges between a client subscriber and the DHCP
server through the CMTS employing DHCP tagging,

<CLAIMS>
A method for message tagging in a system
including a server and one or more client computers,

comprising:

tagging one or more messages from a client computer to
the server with a media access control (MAC) address of

a cable modem that is attached to the client computer
for storing the MAC address as part of a lease record

in the server;
receiving a request for the MAC address of the cable
modem based on the Internet protocol (IP) address of

the client computer from a remote device for
transmitting packets to the client computer;
obtaining the MAC address of the cable modem
corresponding to the IP address of the client computer

from the server; and
transmitting the MAC address to the remote device.
The method of claim 1 wherein tagging one or
more messages comprises appending the MAC address of a

cable modem that is attached to the client computer to
dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) messages

transmitted from the client computer to the server.
The method of claim 2 wherein the one or more
DHCP messages include one or more of the following: a

discover packet and a request packet.
The method of claim 1 wherein prior to tagging
one or more messages, the method comprises:


receiving one or more messages from a client computer;
determining the MAC address of the cable modem that is

coupled to the client computer responsive to receiving
the one or more messages;
appending the MAC address of the cable modem to at
least one of the one or more messages;
transmitting the one or more messages to the server.
The method of claim 4 wherein determining the
MAC address of the cable modem comprises one of the

following: determining the time slot that a message is
received from the client computer and interrogating a

header of the one or more messages.
