<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter for a plasma
display panel (hereinafter abbreviated to 'PDP') disposed on
the front surface of a PDP in order to simultaneously cut
electromagnetic waves and near infrared rays generated from
the PDP, and a PDP display unit with this filter stuck thereto.The present application is based on Japanese Patent
Application No. Hei. 10-273043.A PDP is charged with gas mainly consisting of inert
gas, particularly neon. In the PDP, electrons discharged from
a cathode are accelerated so as to have a collision with gas
molecules and make their way to an anode while being exited
or ionized. Positive ions generated in the anode also collide
against the cathode so that electrons are emitted so as to
commence electrical discharge. At this time, electromagnetic
waves and near infrared rays are emitted with the transition
procedure of neon atoms.The emitted near infrared rays have a wavelength in a
range of from 850 to 1,200 nm. On the other hand, the light
sensitivities of remote controllers for household appliances,
KARAOKE equipments, audio/video systems, etc. are in a range
of from 700 to 1,300 nm. Therefore, there has arisen a problem 
that the near infrared rays emitted from the PDP cause erroneous
operations in the remote controllers. However, the near
infrared rays are generated on the principle of the PDP, and
they cannot be prevented in the PDP itself.Therefore, a filter for cutting electromagnetic waves
and near infrared rays generated from the PDP has been
investigated.In the technical field of transparent glass windows and glazing products, US-A-5 071 206
discloses a transparent heat reflecting filter to be used therewith in order to reflect infrared
radiation and transmit the desired visible radiation. The filter has a laminate structure
comprising alternate transparent dielectric layers and transparent silver metal layers with
normally 3 to 5 transparent metal layers being preferred. The thickness of the various
layers in the filter are controlled to achieve an optimum balance between desired infrared
reflectance and visible light transmittance. The thickness of the dielectric layers
being dependent on the index of refraction and the middle metal layers being formed to
be about 5% to 15% thicker than each of the outer layers.In the background art, for example, there was
employed a method in which a plate in which an acrylic sheet
with low-resistance metal meshes or etched meshes buried
therein and an acrylic sheet mixed with a dye material absorbing
near infrared
