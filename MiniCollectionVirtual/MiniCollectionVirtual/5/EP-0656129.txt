<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toner composition suited for 
development of electrostatic charge images or magnetic patterns. It is well known in the art of electrographic printing and 
electrophotographic copying to form an electrostatic latent image 
corresponding to either the original to be copied, or corresponding 
to digitized data describing an electronically available image. In electrophotography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
the steps of uniformly charging a photoconductive member and 
imagewise discharging it by an imagewise modulated photo-exposure. In electrography an electrostatic latent image is formed by 
imagewise depositing electrically charged particles, e.g. from 
electron beam or ionized gas (plasma) onto a dielectric substrate. The obtained latent images are developed, i.e. converted into 
visible images by selectively depositing thereon light absorbing 
particles, called toner particles, which usually are 
triboelectrically charged. In magnetography a latent magnetic image is formed in a 
magnetizable substrate by a patternwise modulated magnetic field. 
The magnetizable substrate must accept and hold the magnetic field 
pattern required for toner development which proceeds with 
magnetically attractable toner particles. In toner development of latent electrostatic images two 
techniques have been applied : "dry" powder and "liquid" dispersion 
development of which dry powder development is nowadays most 
frequently used. In dry development the application of dry toner powder to the 
substrate carrying the latent electrostatic image may be carried out 
by different methods known as, "cascade", "magnetic brush", "powder 
cloud", "impression" or "transfer" development also known as 
"touchdown" development described e.g. by Thomas L. Thourson in IEEE 
Transactions on Electronic Devices, Vol. ED-19, No. 4, April 1972, 
pp.495-511.  
 The visible image of electrostatically or magnetically attracted 
toner particles is not permanent and has to be fixed by causing the 
toner particles to adhere to the final substrate by softening or 
fusing them followed by cooling. Normally fixing proceeds on more 
or less porous paper by causing or forcing the softened or fused 
toner mass to penetrate into the surface irregularities of the 
paper. Dry-development toners essentially comprise a thermoplastic 
binder consisting of a thermoplastic resin or mixture of resins 
(ref. e.g. US-P 4,271,249) including colouring matter, e.g. carbon 
black or finely dispersed dye pigments. The
