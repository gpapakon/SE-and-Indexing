<ABSTRACT>
A zinc mercaptoacid ester of a polyhydric alcohol or ether, 
carboxylate, or ether-carboxylate thereof having at least one 

functional hydroxy group are improved heat stabilizers for halogen-containing 
polymer compositions. The phenomenon known as zinc burn 

during processing of such compositions is eliminated. Zinc bis-thioglycolates, 
zinc mercaptopropionates and zinc bis-mercaptosuccinates 

of glycols, glycerol, glycol ethers, glycol 
carboxylates, and glycerol carboxylates exemplify the new class of 

heat stabilizers.

<DESCRIPTION>
Halogen containing polymers, especially those containing
chlorine, are used widely and have great commercial significance.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), in particular, is used in packaging,
siding, pipe, and many extruded shapes. Such large scale and
diverse use of the halogen-containing polymers depends upon the
incorporation therein of good heat and light stabilizers. PVC, for
example, is known to have a tendency to degrade upon prolonged
exposure to heat and light during processing and use. Darkening or
other color change and the loss of tensile, flexural, and impact
strengths are the results of such degradation. Unless good low-cost
stabilizers are available for addition to the polymer
composition, the service life of articles made from the composition
is limited, and its use severely restricted, as will be the
conditions for making it.One particularly troublesome form of degradation occurs when
the polymer composition is processed into articles by methods
employing heat to melt or soften the polymer. A color change can
occur during the first few minutes at high temperatures (e.g., from
about 175 to about 200°C) and it is commonly referred to as early
color or early discoloration. The avoidance of such early color is
notably important in the manufacture of plastic pipe and siding.
It is, of course, also important to prevent or reduce discoloration
and deterioration of the polymer during extended exposure to high
temperatures, which can lead to sudden and catastrophic degradation
into a pitch-like abrasive material and cause the formation of
corrosive materials such as HCl inside the fabricating equipment.
The inner, highly polished surfaces of the equipment can thus be
rendered essentially useless. A particularly troublesome instance 
of such sudden degradation often occurs when zinc compounds
are employed as stabilizers; the phenomenon is known as
"zinc burn" in the PVC industry.An example of zinc burn is illustrated in US-A-4,515,916
wherein a PVC composition containing zinc bis-(octyl
thioglycolate) as a stabilizer showed such burn after
3 minutes on a two roll mill at 193°C.The present invention consists in a heat stabilizer, in
particular for halogen-containing polymer compositions,
comprising a zinc mercaptoester having the formula I:
Zn-[S(CHR)a(CH2)x-[C(=O)O]R']2
wherein
R is methyl or C(=O)OR';R' is [(CH2-[C-(R1)(R2)]yCH2O)zR3];R1 is H, alkyl, or hydroxy alkyl;R2 is OH, hydroxy-substituted alkyl, or O(O=)C-R4;R3 is H, (O=)C-R4 for alkyl;R4 is alkyl or alkenyl;
a 0 or 1; x = 1 or 2; y = 0 or 1;
