<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flat-panel display device (1). The display device 
(1) comprises a support (3) on which a plate-shaped waveguide (7) is arranged which is 

irradiated by a radiation source (15) at at least one end face (25). The radiation source 
(15) is arranged in a 
lighthousing (13), a first part (17) of which is an integral part of 
the support (3) and a second part (19) is detachable so that the radiation source (15) can 

be replaced. The lighthousing (13) further accommodates a reflector (29) for reflecting 
radiation emitted by the radiation source (15) towards the waveguide (7). The 

lighthousing (13) with the radiation source (15) and the waveguide (7) jointly constitute 
the illumination system (5) for illuminating a transmission display panel (11) arranged 

on the waveguide (7). The radiation source (15) is provided with lampholders (31) 
which, upon connection of the radiation source (15) in the lighthousing (13), cooperate 

with recesses provided in the lighthousing so that the radiation source (15) is positioned 
free with respect to the reflector (29) and at a distance d from the waveguide (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an illumination system comprising a support, a plate-shaped
waveguide and at least one lighthousing accommodating a tubular radiation source for
illuminating at least one end face of the waveguide, and a reflector for reflecting radiation
emitted by the radiation source towards the waveguide.The invention also relates to a flat-panel display device comprising such an
illumination system.An illumination system for use in a flat-panel display device of the type
described in the opening paragraph is known from the English-language abstract of JP-A 4-141687.
In such illumination systems the lifetime of the radiation source is many orders
shorter than the lifetime of the display device in which the illumination system is used.
Normally, the radiation source is therefore to be replaced several times. A drawback is,
however, that the costs of replacing the radiation source are almost as high as the purchase
price of a complete display device. In fact, in many cases the radiation source is fixedly
connected to the illumination system or to the lighthousing so that the complete lighthousing
or illumination system must be replaced. Moreover, there is a risk of damage of the display
panel of the display device when the complete lighthousing is replaced and of a non-optimum
position of the new lighthousing so that the brightness and homogeneity of the display device
are detrimentally influenced.The illumination system described in said abstract is designed in such a
way that, in the case of maintenance of the display device it is sufficient to replace only the
radiation source in a simple and relatively inexpensive manner instead of replacing the
complete lighthousing or illumination system. The radiation source is situated at the location
of the waveguide and at its side remote from the waveguide it is semi-circularly enclosed by,
and in direct contact with, a reflector. The reflector is formed as a rotatable plate. When the
radiation source is to be replaced, the reflector can be rotated around the axis of the radiation
source so that an opening is formed through which the radiation source can be removed in a
direction perpendicular to its longitudinal direction and a new radiation source can be 
installed.A drawback of the known illumination system is that the reflector is in direct
contact with the radiation source so as to keep the radiation source in position, which results
in a limitation of the temperature of the radiation source and has a detrimental influence on
the lamp

An illumination system arranged for illuminating a flat transmission display panel comprising a plate-shaped waveguide (7),
at least one lighthousing (13) accommodating a tubular radiation source (15) for illuminating at

least one end face of the waveguide (7) and a reflector (29) for reflecting
