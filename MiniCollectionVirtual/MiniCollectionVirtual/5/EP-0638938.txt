<ABSTRACT>
The present application is directed to a thin film silicon SOI device having 
improved source-high performance especially for bridge-type circuits. The device 

prevents forward current saturation during such source-high operations, and is made by 
providing the drift region of a transistor with both a thicker and a thinner portion with 

reduced thickness over 1/3 to 2/3 of its length. Further a field plate is provided, which 
is separated from the gate electrode and extends over the thinner portion of the drift 

region. The gate electrode and field plate are short-circuited by a metal interconnect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a thin film SOI device, comprising a buried
insulating layer; a layer of silicon on said buried insulating layer; an upper insulating
layer on said layer of silicon; said layer of silicon having a laterally extending drift
region, a gate region with a gate electrode above a gate oxide above said gate region at one end of the
drift region, a drain region at an opposite end of the drift region and a source region
laterally separated from said gate region. The invention also relates to a method of
manufacturing such an SOI device.Such a device is known from European patent application 549042 and
sketched in Figure 1. A major problem in high voltage integrated circuit technology is
to find a satisfactory solution for the problem of isolation of components and sub-circuit
sections. In the known device the drift region 4 of a SOI transistor is provided as a thin
layer of silicon having a thickness of about 200 to 300 nanometres. In this device the
insulating layers are of oxide. The upper oxide layer 6 on the silicon layer preferably
has the same thickness as the buried oxide layer 2 below the silicon layer. The benefit
of this structure is the ability to deplete the drift region 4 from both the top and bottom
so that twice the conducting charge may be placed in the drift region 4. This lowers the
on-resistance of the device. In the known device the buried oxide layer 2 has a thickness
ranging from 1 to 3 micron, and the upper oxide layer 6 also has a thickness ranging
from 1 to 3 micron. For this device a high breakdown voltage ranging from 500 - 900V
is achieved where the drift region 4 of the silicon layer 1 is very thin, i.e., 0.1-0.4
micron.In addition the known device provides the drift region 4 with a linear
lateral doping region with the smaller concentration near the gate region. Over the drift
region 4 a field plate 7 is provided. On the silicon layer in the gate region 1 there is a
thin gate oxide 8 above which the polysilicon gate electrode 13 is located. The lateral
extent of the gate electrode overlies the thin lateral linear doping region. The SOI
device includes source and drain regions 10 of n+ conductivity, respectively adjacent
the gate region and drift region. The source region also includes a p+ source layer 11
so that the source-contact 12 contacts both source layers 10 and 11. The source region 
is formed on a p-body 9. Electrical contacts 12 contact each of the source region, drain
region and gate electrode 13.This known structure forms a SOI semiconductor
