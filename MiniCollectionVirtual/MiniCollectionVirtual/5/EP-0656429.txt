<ABSTRACT>
This invention includes lead titanate containing La, and 
at least an element which forms a six-coordinate bond with oxygen 

atoms and which is selected from the group consisting of Mg and 
Mn. Accordingly, this invention provides a ferroelectric thin 

film which is imparted with a high c-axis orientation property 
while the film is formed. In addition, this thin film does not 

require a polarization process as with a bulk crystal. 
The ferroelectric thin film is manufactured by the steps 
of: positioning a MgO single crystal substrate 9 disposed in 

advance with a foundation platinum electrode by a sputtering 
method on the surface of a substrate heater 10, exhausting a 

chamber 7, heating the substrate by the substrate heater 10, 
letting in sputtering gases Ar and O₂ through a nozzle 14 into 

the chamber 7, and maintaining a high degree of vacuum. Then, 
high frequency electric power is input to a target 1 from a high 

frequency electric power source 8 to generate plasma, and a film 
is formed on the substrate 9. In this way, a ferroelectric thin 

film containing, for example, [(1-x)·Pb
1-y
La
y
Ti
1-y/4
O₃+x·MgO], 

where x=0.01∼0.10 and y=0.05∼0.25 can be manufactured.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ferroelectric thin film which
is used e.g. for apyroelectric infrared detecting element or a
piezoelectric element, and further relates to a method of
manufacturing the ferroelectric thin film.A ferroelectric material is characterized by the presence
of spontaneous polarization, even when the material is not in an
electric field. This phenomenon arises from the presence of
permanently-polarized dielectrics forming lines parallel or
antiparallel within the material. In addition, the direction of
polarization can be reversed by application of an external
electric field. By taking advantage of this- property, a
ferroelectric material can be applied to various electronic
components, such as a pyroelectric infrared detecting element, a
piezoelectric element, a light modulator using electro-optical
characteristics, or to a non-volatile memory element. A typical
example of a well-known ferroelectric material is a perovskite
crystal structure oxide, e.g., PbTiO3, Pb1-XLaXTi1-X/4 O3 (PLT),
PbZrxTi1-XO3 (PZT), and BaTiO3. Among these oxides, a PbTiO3 type
ferroelectric material is thought to be a promising pyroelectric
material because of its high Curie temperature, large
pyroelectric coefficient, preferably small dielectric constant,
and small dielectric loss. This material is already put to 
practical use in the form of an infrared sensor using ceramics.Merits of this pyroelectric infrared sensor are that the
operation can take place at room temperature, and the sensor has
no wavelength dependency. Besides, the pyroelectric infrared
sensor is superior among thermal type infrared sensors with
respect to sensitivity and response speed.At present, most ferroelectric materials used for an
infrared detecting element or a piezoelectric element are
polycrystalline ceramics. Along with the recent tendency of
electronic components towards compact size, smaller electronic
components compatible with ferroelectric materials are also
demanded. Furthermore, since a pyroelectric element is formed
thinner, heat capacity decreases and sensitivity increases
accordingly. Therefore, due to the need for improved performance
of an infrared detecting element, and also because of the
development towards smaller and lighter components as mentioned
above, the formation of a ferroelectric single crystal thin film
which can achieve high sensitivity and high speed response has
been drawing attention.For example, a pyroelectric infrared sensor using a
PbTiO3 type thin film of c-axis orientation is reported in J.
