<ABSTRACT>
The nipper assembly possesses a lower nipper frame (14) which carries a lower nipper plate (15). A top comb (16, 17) is also carried on the lower nipper frame (14). Upper nipper arms (19) connected pivotably to the lower nipper frame (14) and an upper nipper knife (20) carried by the upper nipper arms (19) form a nipper top part. The upper nipper knife (20) is provided with a blowing-air channel (21) which has air-outlet orifices (22) for ejecting blowing air into the direction of the top comb (16, 17). The nipper top part (19, 20) possesses means (18.2, 24, 23) for the timed supply of blowing air into the blowing-air channel (21). During operation, the airstream ejected out of the air-outlet orifices (22) sweep over the comb needles (17.2) of the top comb (16, 17) during the opening and closing of the nipper assembly and remove impurities caught on the comb needles (17.2). Moreover, the blowing-air streams force a fibre tuft, which is to be combed out and which, when the nipper assembly is closed, is gripped between the lower nipper plate (15) and the upper nipper knife (20), downwards into a rotating round comb (11, 26) of the combing machine.

A nipper unit for a combing machine, with a lower 
nipper frame (14) which carries a lower nipper 

plate (15), with a top comb (16, 17) provided with 
comb needles (17.2) which is carried by the lower 

nipper frame, with an upper part of the nipper 
with top nipper arms (19; 119) which are 

swivellably connected with the lower nipper frame 
and which carry a top nipper knife (20; 120) 

cooperating with the lower nipper plate (15), and 
with a device for supplying air streams on the 

comb needles (17.2) of the top comb (16; 17) and 
the fibre tufts tightly clamped between the lower 

nipper plate (15) and the top nipper knife (20; 
120), characterized in that the top nipper knife 

(20; 120) is provided with a duct (21; 121) for 
blast air which is provided with at least one air 

outlet opening (22; 122) for blowing blast air in 
the direction towards the top comb (16, 17) and 

that the upper part of the nipper (19, 20; 19, 
120) is provided with means (18.2, 24, 23) for the 

cycled supply of blast air in the blast air duct 
(21; 121). 
A nipper unit as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the blast air duct is formed by a hollow 

chamber (21) in the top nipperknife(20). 
A nipper unit as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the blast air duct (121) is contained in a 

tank (27) placed on a surface of the top nipper 
knife (120). 
A nipper unit as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the air outlet opening  

 
(122) is slot-like and extends over the length of 

the top nipper knife (120). 
A nipper unit as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 
3, characterized in that the blast air duct (21) 

is provided with a number of air outlet openings 
(22) distributed over the length of the top nipper 

knife (20). 
A nipper unit as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the blast air duct (121) 

is provided at its ends with additional air outlet 
openings (28) which have a larger cross section 

than the air outlet opening(s) (122) in the 
central region of the length of the top nipper 

knife (120). 
A nipper unit as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the means for supplying 

blast air comprise recesses (23) in the top nipper 
knife (20) which are in connection with bores (24) 

in the top nipper arms (19) and lead to the blast 
air duct (21; 121). 
A nipper unit as claimed in claim 7, characterized 
in that the bores (24) in the top nipper arms (19) 

start out from bearing bores into which extend 
hollow bearing bolts (18) attached in the lower 

nipper frame (14), each of which is provided with 
radial outlet openings (18.2) starting out from 

its hollow chamber (18.1).
