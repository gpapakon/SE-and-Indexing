<ABSTRACT>
In an established method of lining underground pipelines and passageways a lining tube which is impregnated with curable synthetic resin is filled with hot water to press the tube to the pipeline or passageway surface and also to heat cure the resin. When the cure has been completed the lining remains free standing in the pipeline or passageway surface. In this invention the same lining operation is performed but the heating is in stages by isolating lengths of the lining tube in turn and by circulating hot water through the isolated lengths in turn. Considerable advantage is obtained in that much less water needs to be heated.

<DESCRIPTION>
Improvements Relating to the Lining of Pipelines and PassagewaysThis invention relates to the lining of pipelines and passageways especially but not exclusively underground pipelines or passageways by the so-called soft lining or cured in place method.In this method, a tubular liner of resin absorbent material surrounded by a coating membrane or film of an impermeable material is soaked in a curable synthetic resin, and then the lining tube whilst still flexible i.e. the resin is uncured, is inflated by any suitable fluid medium such as air or water onto the underground pipeline or passageway surface. Whilst the lining tube is so held, the resin is cured or caused to cure so that it hardens into a substantially rigid pipe within the existing pipeline or passageway, the absorbent material being embedded in the cured resin. The process is used mainly for the relining of sewers; it provides first class rehabilitation of sewers and it has been tremendously successful.An extremely effective pipelining construction results, and in fact the pipelining is carried this way throughout the world and to a considerable extent.The examples of the method are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4009063 and 4064211 which show that the lining tube may be inserted in the pipeline or passageway by any of several methods including an eversion method in which one end of the lining pipe is held at one end of the length of passageway to be lined, and the remainder of the lining tube is everted through the held end by a suitable fluid, usually water, in order simultaneously to apply the lining tube to the pipeline or passageway surface, and to hold it to such surface whilst 

curing takes place.In an alternative method, referred to as pull in and inflate, the lining tube is simply inserted for example by pulling into the pipeline or passageway and then is inflated up to the pipeline or passageway surface by any suitable means such as an inflation tube which is everted into the inside of the lining tube.A combination of these installation methods has been proposed and used in that two impregnated lining tubes may be used, a first of which is pulled into the pipeline or passageway and the second of which is everted into the first when it is inside the pipeline or passageway.As to the method of curing the resin when the lining tube is in place, whilst other methods of curing resin have been proposed, such as curing by light radiation or by ultrasonics, by far the vast majority of cured in place lining work involves curing of the resin

CLAIMS
1. A method of lining a pipeline or passageway wherein a lining tube comprising resin absorbent material which is impregnated with heat curable synthetic resin is urged by pressure against the pipeline or passageway surface, and heat is applied in stages to lengths of the lining tube by the following steps
a) a first length is isolated from the remainder of the lining tube by expanding expansible and contractible means located inside the pipe,
b) heated fluent medium is supplied to inside said first length so that the heat therein cures the resin in said first length,
c) the expansible and contractible means is contracted and moved to a new position along the inside of the lining tube,
d) the expandible and contractible means is expanded to isolate a second length of lining tube,
e) heated fluent medium is supplied to inside said second length so that the heat therein cures the resin in said second length, and
f) if necessary, repeating the above steps for third and further lengths of the lining tube in order to complete the cure of the resin throughout the lining tube
2. A method according to Claim 1, wherein the said pipeline or passageway is underground and the heated medium is supplied from ground level through pipes connected to Said expansible and contractible means. 


3. A method according to Claim 2, wherein the heated medium is circulated from ground level through a supply pipe to the or each isolated length and is returned through a return pipe to ground level.
4. A method according to Claim 3, wherein said heated medium is hot water.
5. A method according to Claim 1, wherein said expansible and contractible means is inflatable for expansion of same and is deflatable for contraction of same.
6. A method according to Claim 5, wherein the pipeline or passageway is located underground and the expansible and contractible means is expanded and contracted by contracting the supply of compressed air thereto from ground level.
7 A method according to Claim 6, wherein said expansible and contractible means comprises a pair of inflatable collars connected to a pull rope means by which the collars can be pulled along the inside of the tube, said collars being connected to the pull rope means so as to be opened thereon when the pull rope means is pulled taught.
8. A method according to Claim 7, wherein said pull rope means comprises a rope trained round a pulley fixed to the lining tube at one end thereof so as to define two reaches which extend from the pulley to the other end of the lining, one reach being connected to the expansible and contractible collars and the other reach extending slidably through the collars, and after the resin in each length of lining tube is cured, the collars are deflated and the collars are pulled by the rope to a new position.
