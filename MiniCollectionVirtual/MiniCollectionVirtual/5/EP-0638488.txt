<ABSTRACT>
A microwavable food product including components of 
different water content in which an edible barrier to the 

passage of water is provided between the components. In a 
preferred product a component with a relatively low water 

content has had its water content reduced below 2% prior to 
assembly of the product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to microwavable food products 
having two components of different water contents and water 
activities. The invention also relates to a methods for 
making the food product. Some food products have constituent components of different 
water contents. Examples of such products include pies, 
quiches, pizzas, crumbles and the like, which have a sauce 
or filling of a relatively high water content and a pastry 
or other cereal component having a relatively low water 
content. It is known to be a problem in such multi-component food 
products that moisture migrates from the wetter to the 
drier component during storage. The drier component can 
also take up water from the environment. Even when the 
products are stored in the frozen state, a certain amount 
of water migration can still occur between the different 
components. The driving force for water transfer in food products is 
primarily the water partial pressure gradient existing 
between the product and the environment, or between the 
different components of the product. This partial pressure 
can be expressed as water activity (aw), which is the 
partial pressure of water exerted by the food divided by 
the partial pressure of pure water at the same temperature. 
However, even in the absence of a water partial pressure 
gradient, water can migrate via liquid diffusion driven by 
such forces as water concentration gradients or capillary 
forces.  Generally, though, the rate of water transfer between two 
components of a food product increases with an increase in 
the aw gradient, ie as the difference between water partial 
pressures of the food components increases. The rate of 
transfer also increases with closer contact between the 
components, and with increasing temperature [1,2,3]. An increase in the water content of the drier component, 
such as a foodstuff containing ground and baked cereals, 
leads to significant and deleterious changes in the 
"organoleptic" properties of that component (ie, its taste, 
texture and general acceptability to the consumer). For 
instance, an increase in the water content of pastry, or a 
similar combination of ground cereal and fat, adversely 
affects its texture. During reheating of a multi-component food product in a 
conventional radiant heat or convection oven, water gained 
by the "drier" component can be driven off and some or all 
of the desired texture can be restored. However, if the 
product is reheated using microwave energy, the much 
shorter cooking times necessary

<CLAIMS>
A food product comprising a first food component 
having a relatively high water activity and a relatively 

high water content; a second food component having a 
relatively low water activity and a relatively low water 

content; said food product being intended to be made ready 
for consumption by microwave heating for a time sufficient 

to raise the temperature of the first food component to at 
least 72Â°C; and, located between the two components, an 

edible barrier to the passage of water from the first 
component to the second component, the barrier being in the 

form of a substrate supported film which, at least between 
the components, is substantially continuous. 
A food product according to Claim 1 in which the 
moisture content of the first component has, prior to the 

assembly of the food product, been reduced to less than 2%. 
A food product according to Claim 2 in which the 
first component is formed of pastry and the moisture 

content has been reduced by a drying or baking process. 
A food product according to any of the preceding 
claims in which the substrate is a sheet which is 

positioned between the two components. 
A food product according to Claim 4 in which the 
sheet is a self-supporting sheet and is positioned out of 

contact with at least the first component. 
A food product according to any of Claims 1 to 3 
in which the substrate is provided by at least one of the 

components. 
A food product according to any of the preceding 
claims in the form of a pie having a meat or fruit base 

filling. 
A food product according to any of Claims 1 to 6 
in which the product is in the form of a fruit crumble. 
A food product according to any of Claims 1 to 6 
in which the product is in the form of a meat filled pastry 

roll. 
A food product according to any of the preceding 
claims in which the edible barrier is provided by a lipid.
