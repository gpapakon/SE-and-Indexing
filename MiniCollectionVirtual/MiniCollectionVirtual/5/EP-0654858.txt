<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electrical socket provided with a retractable shutter designed to close off the openings of the socket in the absence of a plug corresponding to this socket. This socket (10) includes an element (11) for supporting the current-distributing cavities (12), a cassette (13) serving for mounting the shutter (14) and containing a return spring (15), and a front shell (body) (16) mounted at the front of the socket. The shutter includes three pads (26) intended to shut off the openings (29) made in this shell in order to allow passage of the two power-supply pins (31) and of a pin (33) for polarising a plug (32). It is urged in the closure position by a closure spring (15). This shutter is balanced on the spring in such a way that it opens only if the pins (31, 33) of the plug are inserted simultaneously.

A current socket base comprising a support element (11) for current distribution recesses 
(12), a front plate (16) arranged to receive a plug equipped with pins (31) of a piece of 

electrical equipment, a cassette (13) arranged between said support element and said front 
plate and containing a retractable blanking plate (14) designed to occupy a rest position in 

which it blanks off openings (29) arranged in the front plate and intended to give said pins 
access to said current distribution recesses, and a retracted position in which it frees said 

openings, said blanking plate (14) comprising : 

studs (26) arranged to engage at least partially in said openings (29) of the front plate (16), 
said studs corresponding to the pins (31, 33) of said plug (32), 
means for generating rotation of the blanking plate around its axis, in response to an axial 
thrust exerted simultaneously by said pins of the plug on said studs, 
a central part (23) having a circular central opening (24) and at least three arms (25) whose 
ends each bear one of said studs (26), 
 
characterized in that : 


said blanking plate (14) is in equilibrium on a fictitious point located on its axis by means of 
the central part (23) in the form of a spherical cap, the opening (24) of the central part (23) of 

the blanking plate (14) having a diameter greater than the diameter of a cylindrical element 
(21) securedly united to the cassette (13), on which said blanking plate is mounted in such a 

way as to arrange a clearance between this cylindrical element and said blanking plate, 
an error prevention pin (33) is fitted on the plug (32) to allow rotation of the blanking plate 
(14) to the retracted position. 
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that it comprises a return spring (15) 
arranged to move the blanking plate back to its initial position after the plug (32) has been 

withdrawn, said spring (15) comprising several circular turns, one end (15a) rendered 
securedly united to the front plate (16) and another end (15b) securedly united to the blanking 

plate (14). 
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that the cassette (13) comprises a base 
(22) coaxial to said cylindrical element (21) to act as bearing point for rotation and rocking of 

the blanking plate (14). 
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that said means for generating rotation of 
the blanking plate (14) around its axis comprise inclined ramps arranged respectively on the 

front surfaces of each of said studs (26).
