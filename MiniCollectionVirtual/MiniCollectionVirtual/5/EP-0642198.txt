<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electronic protection device intended for thermal protection of a load (M), comprising a thermal detector (1) equipped with at least one resistive element (11, 12, 13) thermally coupled to a temperature sensor (14), the latter being connected to an electronic processing circuit (3) able to supply a control command as a function of the overload detected by the temperature sensor (14), and characterised in that each of the resistive elements (11, 12, 13) of the thermal detector (1) is fed with rectified current supplied by a current sensor (T1, T2, T3) arranged on a live wire (L1, L2, L3) feeding the load (M).

Electronic protection device intended to
protect a load (M) thermally by cutting the current

supply to the load, the device comprising current
sensors (T

,
L
3
) and connected to the resistors (11, 12, 13) of a
temperature detector (1), and an electronic processing

circuit (3) capable of issuing an order depending on
the overload, characterized in that resistors (11, 12,

13) of the temperature detector are powered by
rectified currents drawn from the outputs of rectifiers

(R1, R2, R3) associated with current sensors (T1, T2,
T3), said resistors (11, 12, 13) being thermally

coupled to a temperature sensor (14) connected to said
electronic processing circuit (3), and signals

representing the voltage at the terminals of each
resistor (11, 12, 13) are sent to an analogue/digital

converter (31) of the electronic processing circuit
(3), said analogue/digital converter being a

microprocessor or similar converter.
Device of claim 1 characterized in that each
resistor (11, 12, 13) is connected to the input of the

analogue/digital converter (31) via a voltage divider
(5).
Device of any of the previous claims
characterized in that the various resistors (11, 12,

13) are coupled thermally to a single and common
temperature sensor (14) by a thermal coupling plate

(15) made in a temperature-resistant material that does

not conduct electricity. 
Device of any of the previous claims
characterized in that each resistor (11, 12, 13) is

printed on the thermal coupling plate (15).
Device of any of the previous claims
characterized in that each resistor (11, 12, 13) is

connected to a circuit (4) used to supply the
electronic processing circuit (3) and is connected to

the secondary outputs of the rectifiers (R1, R2, R3)
associated with the current sensors.
Device of any of the previous claims
characterized in that electronic processing circuit (3)

controls a driving element (4) that operates a lock (5)
which in turn operates power contacts arranged on phase

conductors (L
