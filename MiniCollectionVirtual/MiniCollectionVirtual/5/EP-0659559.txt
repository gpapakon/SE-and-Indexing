<ABSTRACT>
A method for controlling the ink supply in a printing machine, in particular a sheet-fed offset printing machine, is described. Ink density spectrums are recorded at several points on the image of the master and of the printed copy by means of a spectral photometer and the differential ink density spectrums are determined therefrom. These differential ink density spectrums are then depicted as a linear combination of the individual ink density spectrums of the colours involved in the combined printing. Setting commands for the ink supply members of the printing machine are then derived from the proportionality factors of this linear combination.

<CLAIMS>
Process for controlling the ink feed in a printing
press, particularly an offset printing press, in which

the ink density spectra of at least one image position
in master and printed sample are sensed and a

determination of control commands for the ink feed
elements of the printing press taking into account the

ink density spectra of the inks taking part in the
composite printing of the image position takes place

starting from the fact that the greatest possible
agreement of the ink density spectra of the image

positions of master and printed sample is achieved,
characterised in that from the ink density spectra of

the image position of master and printed sample, the
difference ink density spectrum is determined, that

the difference ink density spectrum is represented as
a linear combination of the ink density spectra of the

individual printing inks taking part in the composite
printing, and that the control commands for the ink

feeding elements of the printing press are determined
from the proportionality factors of this linear

combination.
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that a
weighting of the ink density spectra of the individual

printing inks taking part in the composition printing
of the image positions takes place corresponding to

their proportion of surface to be printed.
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the determination of the proportion of surface to

be printed for the printing ink black takes place via 
a determination of the
 infrared ink density D(IR).
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that printing inks with a small

proportion of surface to be printed remain ignored in
the representation of the difference ink density

spectrum.
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the sensing of the ink density

spectra of the individual printing inks taking part in
the composite printing of the image position takes

place on full tone measuring fields co-printed on the
printed sample.
