A multiple-spindle lathe with at least two 
workpiece spindle units (18, 20) which are arranged in 

parallel side by side and act in the same direction and 
which are displaceable independently of one another in the 

direction of the X axis and horizontal Z axis, which 
workpiece spindle units are movable in the X-direction 

respectively between an operative position, in which they 
co-operate respectively with a tool carrier (22, 24), and a 

transfer position, characterised in that each workpiece 
spindle unit (18, 20) is individually associated with a 

stationary tool carrier (22, 24) and at the transfer 
position disposed between the associated operative positions
 
   two adjacent workpiece spindle units (18, 20) co-operate 

directly with a common reversing means (30). 
A multiple-spindle lathe according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that guides (12, 16) for the workpiece 

spindle units (18, 20) are disposed outside an operating 
space defined by walls, in which the tool carriers (22, 24) 

and the workpiece-holding device at the front ends of the workpiece 
spindle units (18, 20) are situated. 
A multiple-spindle lathe according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the workpiece spindle units (18, 20) 

are mounted displaceably in the Z-direction on slides (14) 
which are movable along a common guide (12) in the X-direction. 
A multiple-spindle lathe according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that at least one tool 

carrier is a tool turret mounted at a fixed location.  
 
An operating process to be carried out with a 
multiple-spindle lathe according to any one of Claims 1 to 

4, characterized in that a first workpiece spindle unit (18) 
loads a workpiece (34) at a charging station by movement in 

the Z-direction, the workpiece is guided during a first 
machining operation in the X-direction and/or Z-direction 

after a conveying movement in the X-direction to a first 
operating station, subsequently the workpiece is conveyed by 

the first workpiece spindle unit (18) in the X-direction to 
a reversing means (30) and is transferred thereto by 

movement in the Z-direction, is then turned through 180° in 
the reversing means, then by movement in the Z-direction of 

a second workpiece spindle unit (20), which is arranged 
parallel and at the side of the first workpiece spindle unit and 

acts in the same direction, is loaded by the second 
workpiece spindle unit, is conveyed by the movement thereof 

in the X-direction towards a second operating station, is 
guided there during a second machining operation by the 

second workpiece spindle unit (20) in the X-direction and/or 
Z-direction and, finally, is transferred thereby by 

conveying movements in the X-direction and Z-direction to an 

unloading device (38).
