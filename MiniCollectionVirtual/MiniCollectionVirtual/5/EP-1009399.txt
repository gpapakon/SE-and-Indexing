<DESCRIPTION>
 GABA ANALOGS TO PREVENT AND TREAT GASTROINTESΗNAL DAMAGEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to a method for preventing visceral and gastrointestinal damage such as gastric ulcers by administering a gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) analog, and for treating gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD), functional bowel disorders (FBD), including dyspepsia and other visceral pain.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most frequently prescribed drugs for the treatment of pain associated with osteoarthritis and many other musculoskeletal and inflammatory disorders. In the United States, about 100 million prescriptions are written each year to provide effective relief of pain and treatment of inflammatory diseases. Commonly used NSAIDs include sulindac, naproxen, indomethacin, mefenamic acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, and diflunisal.However, considerable evidence indicates that NSAIDs have frequent, serious, and costly gastrointestinal tract toxic side effects. These include mild dyspepsia, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, as well as more serious gastrointestinal complications such as bleeding and perforation, leading sometimes to significant morbidity and, to a lesser extent, mortality. Serious GI complications due to NSAID use represent the greatest threat to life in patients with connective tissue diseases, second only to the primary disease and its complications. Similar gastrointestinal damage is caused by ingestion of alcohol. Indeed, a condition known as ethanol withdrawal syndrome is commonly encountered when prolonged ethanol consumption is terminated. In addition to gastrointestinal damage, this syndrome often results in tremors, anxiety, convulsions, hallucinations, and confusion. 

 Other commonly encountered gastrointestinal disorders include inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD) and functional bowel disorders (FBD), including dyspepsia. These GI disorders include a wide range of disease states that are currently only moderately controlled, including Crohn's disease, ileitis, ischemic bowel disease, and ulcerative colitis, as well as IBD, the irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia, and gastro-esophageal reflux for FBD, and other forms of visceral pain.Gamma-aminobutyric acid has been shown to activate gastric afferent nerves which, in turn, have been shown to participate in gastric defense mechanisms. We have now discovered that GABA analogs dramatically reduce the gastrointestinal damage caused by drugs and alcohol. The GABA

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A method for preventing and treating gastrointestinal damage and disorders comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment an effective amount of a GABA analog.
2. A method according to Claim 1 employing a compound of Formula I
wherein Ri is hydrogen or lower alkyl and n is an integer of from 4 to 6, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
3. The method according to Claim 2 employing gabapentin.
4. The method according to Claim 1 employing a compound selected from
( 1 -aminomethyl-3 -methylcyclohexyl)acetic acid, (l-aminomethyl-3-methylcyclopentyl)acetic acid, and ( 1 -aminomethyl-3 ,4-dimethylcyclopentyl)acetic acid.

8. The method according to Claim 5 employing 3-(l-aminoethyl)- 5-methylhexanoic acid.
9. The method according to Claim 1 wherein the gastrointestinal damage is in a subject who is receiving or will receive NSIAD therapy or alcohol.
10. The method according to Claim 1 wherein the gastrointestinal damage is characterized as inflammatory bowel disorder or irritable bowel syndrome.
11. The method according to Claim 1 wherein the condition treated is selected from Crohn's disease, ileitis, ischemic bowel disease, dyspepsia, and ulcerative colitis.
12. A method for treating ethanol withdrawal syndrome in a mammal in need of treatment comprising administering an effective amount of a GABA analog.

22. A composition according to Claim 17 wherein the non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drug is selected from sulindac, naproxen, indomethacin, mefenamic acid, diclofenac, fenoprofen, diflunisal, etodolac, ibuprofen, piroxicam, acetylsalicylic acid, oxaprozin, and bromfenac, or pharmaceutical salts thereof.
23. A composition according to Claim 22 wherein the non-steroidal anti- inflammatory drug is selected from naproxen sodium, ibuprofen, or indomethacin.
24. A composition of Claim 23 comprised of naproxen sodium and pregabalin.
