<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a free radical polymerization process for the preparation of a thermoplastic resin or resins comprising heating a mixture of a free radical initiator, a stable free radical agent, and at least one polymerizable monomer compound to form a thermoplastic resin or resins with a high monomer to polymer conversion; cooling said mixture; optionally isolating the thermoplastic resin or resins; and optionally washing and drying thermoplastic resin or resins. Related free radical processes are also disclosed for the preparation of mixtures and block copolymer thermoplastic resins. Resins prepared by the disclosed processes possess a narrow polydispersity and a modality that is controlled by the selection of a free radical initiator and stable free radical agent addition step or steps. The figure is a plot of percent conversion versus molecular weight of a polystyrene homopolymer product obtained from a bulk or solventless stable free radical agent moderated polymerization of styrene at 130 degrees centigrade.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a free radical polymerization process for the
preparation of a thermoplastic resin or resins
having a weight average molecular weight of from
10,000 to 200,000. The use of free radical polymerization inhibitors of free radical
polymerizations is known, see for example, G. Moad et. al., Polymer Bulletin 6, 589 (1982). Studies
by, for example, G. Moad et. al. J. Macromol. Sci.-Chem, A17(1), 51(1982) have reported on
the use of free radicals polymerization inhibitors of free radical polymerizations performed at
low temperatures, for example, below 90°C and at low monomer to polymer conversions.
Little is known concerning the reaction of free radical polymerization inhibitors C in the following abbreviated as SFR at higher
temperatures and at high monomer to polymer conversions.In a hypothetical free radical polymerization of styrene, in which chains are
continually initiated over the course of the polymerization, and where chain termination
by coupling processes is also occurring, calculations as described in, for example, G. G.
Odian, Principles of Polymerization, pages 280 - 281, 2nd Ed., John Wiley & Sons, 1981 have
shown that the narrowest polydispersity that one can theoretically possibly obtain is 1.5. 
In practice, polydispersities much greater than 1.5 are actually obtained. Polydispersities
of between 2.0 and 2.4 are typical for free radical homopolymerizations of styrene. In the
case of copolymer systems, polydispersities of greater than 4 are generally obtained.The free radical polymerization system of the instant invention may
readily afford polydispersities of between 1.15 and 1.25 for polystyrene and as low as 1.5
for various copolymer systems. Stable free radical polymerization systems of the instant
invention afford polydispersities that are comparable to those obtained in anionic
polymerizations.US-A-4,581,429 discloses a free radical polymerization process which controls
the growth of polymer chains to produce short chain or oligomeric homopolymers and
copolymers including block and graft copolymers. The process employs an initiator having
the formula (in part) = N-O-X, where X is a free radical species capable of polymerizing
unsaturated monomers. The molecular weights of the polymer products obtained are
generally from about 2,500 to 7,000 having polydispersities generally of about 1.4 to 1.8,
at low monomer to polymer conversion. The reactions typically have low conversion rates
and use relatively low reaction temperatures of less than about 100 degrees
