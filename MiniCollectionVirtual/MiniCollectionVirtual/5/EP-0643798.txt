<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
the controlled operation of engine operation cycles, 
and more particularly, the invention relates to a 
preestablished logic pattern and the modifying of the 
preestablished logic pattern to sequentially, and 
modulateably controlling valve timing to improve the 
transient response time from low speed and/or low 
loads to high speed and/or high loads and to reduce 
particulates. During low speed operation of a turbocharged 
engine there is more than sufficient air for 
combustion, however, the transient response time of 
the engine from low speed and low loads to high speed 
and high loads is slow because of the time needed to 
raise the boost pressure level from the turbocharger. 
Exhaust gas drives a turbine of the turbocharger 
which, in turn, drives a compressor of the 
turbocharger providing supercharged air to the 
combustion chambers of the engine. During low speed 
operation the exhaust gas flow caused by the low rate 
of engine displacement fails to generate a substantial 
pressure drop across the turbine. As a result, the 
turbine is being driven at a relative slow speed and 
the boost pressure level attained by the turbocharger 
is low. By the injection of additional fuel in the 
combustion chambers the speed of the engine is 
increased which, in turn, creates more exhaust gas  
 
flow to drive the turbine faster which, in turn, 
increases the boost pressure level. However, there is 
an undesirable time lag until the turbine can be 
brought up to full speed and the boost pressure level 
increased to obtain full power from the engine. Also, 
during this relatively long transient time period 
there is an insufficient amount of air for clean 
combustion of the amount of fuel injected creating 
black smoke. Variable-cycle engines are known in the art. 
For example EP-A-0 396 325 
teaches 
operating in a two-cycle mode when the rotational 
speed of the engine is lower than a predetermined 
speed and in a four-cycle mode when the rotational 
speed is higher than a predetermined speed. An 
electric motor assist the rotation of the compressor 
of the turbocharger in the low engine speed range. To improve the transient response time 
heretofore, engines employed multiple turbochargers or 
adjustable output turbochargers. The result being 
increased customer cost and a greater possibility of 
hardware failure due to an increased number of 
components and complexity. Thus, what is needed is an apparatus to 
improve the transient response time of the engine
