<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing L-(-)-carnitine is disclosed which 
comprises converting D-(+)-carnitinamide to an ester, acylating said 

ester, converting the ester group to carboxyl group thus obtaining D-(+)-carnitine, 
converting this latter compound to the lactone of L-(-)-carnitine 

which treated in a basic environment yields L-(-)-carnitine 
inner salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved process for 
manufacturing L-(-)-carnitine from a starting compound containing an 
asymmetrical carbon atom having a configuration opposite to that of L-(-)-carnitine. 
The process of the present invention overcomes the drawbacks 
of conventional processes which first convert a starting compound into 
an achiral intermediate, generally crotonobetaine or gamma-butyrobetaine, 
and then convert the achiral intermediate to L-(-)-carnitine. 
The process of the present invention uses D-(+)-carnitinamide 
as starting compound. Carnitine contains a single center of asymmetry and therefore 
exists as two enantiomers, designated D-(+)-carnitine and L-(-)-carnitine. 
Of these, only L-(-)-carnitine is found in living organisms, where it 
functions as a vehicle for transporting fatty acids across mitochondrial 
membranes. Whilst L-(-)-carnitine is the physiologically-active 
enantiomer, racemic D,L-carnitine has conventionally been used as a 
therapeutic agent. It is now recognized, however, that D-(+)-carnitine is a 
competitive  
 
inhibitor of carnitine acyltransferases, and that it 
diminishes the level of L-(-)-carnitine in myocardium and 
skeletal muscle. It is therefore essential that only L-(-)-carnitine be 
administered to patients undergoing haemodialysis treatment or 
treatment for cardiac or lipid metabolism disorders. The same 
requirement applies to the therapeutic utilization of acyl 
derivatives of carnitine for treating disorders of the 
cerebral metabolism, peripheral neuropathies, peripheral 
vascular diseases and the like. These disorders are typically 
treated with acetyl L-(-)-carnitine and propionyl 
L-(-)-carnitine, which are obtained by acylating 
L-(-)-carnitine. Various chemical procedures have been proposed for the 
industrial-scale production of carnitine. Unfortunately, 
these procedures are not stereospecific and produce racemic 
mixtures of D-(+)- and L-(-)-isomers. It is thus necessary to 
apply resolution methods in order to separate the enantiomeric 
constituents of the racemate. Typically, the D,L-racemic mixture is reacted with an 
optically active acid (e.g. D-(-)-tartaric acid, 
D-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid, (+)-dibenzoyl-D-(-)-tartaric acid, 
N-acetyl-L-(+)-glutamic acid and D-(+)-camphoric acid) to 
obtain two diastereoisomers which can be separated from each 
other. In the classic process disclosed in U.S. Patent 
4,254,053, D-(+)-camphoric acid is used as the resolution  
 
agent of a racemic mixture of D,L-carnitinamide, obtaining
