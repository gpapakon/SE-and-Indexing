<ABSTRACT>
A seal face of at least one ring used in a non-contacting, 
gap-type mechanical end face seal having a 

pattern including an optional dam and an annular grooved 
area. The annular grooved area has one of several 

embodiments, including entrance lands which are 
essentially triangular and have one side contiguous with 

one circumferential edge of the annular grooved area. 
These embodiments further include a set of converging 

boundary sides of the groove to provide a pressure zone 
effect. Seal face patterns include a contiguous groove 

around the circumference of the seal face and a series of 
annular bands comprising a repeating pattern of an 

essentially triangular groove interposed between two 
adjacent, but oppositely oriented, lands. One seal face 

pattern includes a circular or elliptical groove being 
open to the circumferential edge, thus providing an 

entrance land effect, and which includes a circular or 
elliptical land within it so that the boundaries between 

the lands and groove converge to provide the pressure 
zone effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to mechanical face 
seals for sealing the space between a housing and a 
relatively rotating shaft, and in particular to face 
seals having shallow grooves in their sealing surfaces 
for maintaining a gap between the relatively rotating 
sealing members. Spiral groove mechanical face seals are used to 
create a non-contacting seal between a rotating shaft and 
its housing. A gap between two sealing faces, one of 
which is rotating with regard to the other, is maintained 
by a film of pressurized fluid pumped between the faces 
by spiral grooves in at least one of the sealing faces. 
Examples of spiral groove face seals are found in US 
Patent No 3,804,424 issued to Gardner and US Patent Nos 
4,212,475 and 4,290,611 issued to Sedy. All of these 
patents are commonly assigned to the assignee of the 
present invention. The spiral groove face seals described in these 
patents and generally those in present use include an 
annular primary sealing ring having a radially extending 
face in sealing relation with the radially extending face 
of an annular mating ring. In operation, either the 
primary ring or the mating ring rotates with the shaft 
and includes a radial face in sealing relation to the 
radial face of the other ring which is itself sealed 
against the housing. In conventional contacting seals, 
friction between the two faces during relative rotation 
produces heat, causing seal face  
 
deformation, accelerated aging of the seal components and 
other undesirable conditions. It has been found that a very narrow gap or space 
between the relatively rotating radial faces permits a very 
small amount of the sealed fluid to leak or flow to the low 
pressure side, but that the fluid leading through between the 
relatively rotating seal faces provides a convective cooling 
effect which prevents unwanted heat generation. Such a gap 
is obtained by a series of spiral grooves in the face of 
either or both the primary or mating rings which, upon 
rotation of one of the rings relative to the other, act as a 
pumping mechanism to force fluid between the seal faces. The 
fluid flow separates the faces and acts as a film lubricant, 
maintaining the gap and allowing the faces to slide against 
one another without contact between them. Other mechanical face seals utilizing grooved 
surfaces have been proposed. For example, U.S. Patent No. 
4,420,162 describes a face seal having spiral grooves 
extending from the inner circumference to the outer 
circumference that are both
