<ABSTRACT>
A hand attachment is lined above and below a wrist portion with parallel 
conductive contacts. One set of contacts is connected to a signal generator which 

generates control signals for moving characters in a video game. The second set of 
contacts is connected to the video game. Placing the hand at an angle selectively 

connects the contacts, sending the desired direction control signal to the video game. 
Conductive contacts are also located on the thumb and fingertips. Placing the thumb in 

contact with any of the fingertips connects a static signal generator to the video game. 
The hand attachment may be a glove or a wrist cuff. The control signals generated by 

the hand attachment may be wirelessly transmitted to the video game.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an input device for interfacing with computers. 
More specifically, the present invention relates to a hand attachment which responds to 
movements of the wrist or fingers to produce command signals to control video elements 
on a video display. Joystick controllers have been commonly used to produce command signals that 
control game elements in video games. More recent video game controllers such as the 
SEGA GENESIS and the NINTENDO NES have replaced the joystick with an arcuate 
pad manipulated by a thumb. When not in use, the control handle of the joystick, or arcuate pad, returns to a 
neutral position located in the center of its base. Moving the joystick from its neutral 
position in a desired direction closes a specific directional switch, thereby coupling a 
coded signal, unique to that particular direction and switch, to the video game. The 
video game responds to the coded signal by moving an object on the screen. The advent of virtual reality has prompted the exploration of interactive control 
gloves for the video game market. In the field of gloves, movement of the fingers and 
an absolute position of the glove are monitored. One such interactive control glove was the DATAGLOVE, in which fiber optic 
cables line each finger. Movement of a finger changes the amount of light flowing 
through the fiber optic cables. A computer interface monitors the change in light 
intensity and compares it to the prior light intensity to determine how the finger moved. 
Spatial position and orientation is determined by a magnetic sensor. The allure of virtual reality technology has prompted the video game market to 
shift from joystick controllers toward an interactive method of control. One of the first  
 
interactive control gloves for the video game market was the NINTENDO 
POWERGLOVE. Similar in function to the DATAGLOVE, the POWERGLOVE 
recognizes movement of the fingers by detecting fluctuations in current through 
conductive ink located in the fingers of the POWERGLOVE, whereas the spatial position 
and orientation of the POWERGLOVE is monitored using ultrasonics. A drawback of these prior art gloves is that they are incompatible with video 
games designed for joystick control because the prior art gloves cannot replicate the 
absolute control signals generated by a joystick. The prior art gloves rely on continuous 
finger and hand motion to produce the control signals required to operate the video game. 
If the user does not move his hand or fingers, then control
