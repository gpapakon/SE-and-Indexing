<ABSTRACT>
An interchangeable guide (4) is applied on the mobile plane (2) 
of a sewing machine, for the alignment of the belt carrier(s) (5) 

of belts (6), pre-arranged for the sewing of buckles (7). To said 
guide a transversal lever (12) is coupled for the ejection of the 

sewn belts and the alignment and hooking of same in a traction 
fork (14) connected to a transversal dragging piston (15) 

provided for the taking away of sewn belts, their temporary 
alignment relatively to a device (19) for the removal of the 

protruding thread ends and the alignment and unloading of said 
belts into collection containers (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus comprising an 
interchangeable guide for the engagement of the belt carrier(s), 
already pre-mounted on said belts for the sewing operation, 
together with the corresponding buckles, and an alternated 
movement transversal ejection lever. The flat bed, positionable 
according to coordinates pre-established and planned with 
temporized halts, draws up in such a way as to cause the needle 
of the sewing machine to perform the sewing operating stages 
along the side of said interchangeable guide. Once seams are ready, the needle lifting is followed by a 
translation of said transversal lever, which pushes towards the 
outside the belt with the relevant carrier(s) and the buckle 
suitably connected by a seam, until the belt engages with a 
hooking fork integral with a longitudinal dragging device. Once hooked, the sewn and completed belt is longitudinally 
dragged until the above seams are positioned on special means for 
the removal of the protruding thread residues, after which it is 
unloaded into underlying aligned containers. The whole is carried out automatically, through cycles planned 
and temporized according to the type of belt, the number and type 
of carriers, the type of buckle, the type of sewing-thread. The 
procedures utilized by the known art for connecting buckles and 
carriers to belts require a pre-positioning of said details and a 
subsequent hand intervention which aligns, as much as possible, 
the belts to the heads of the sewing machine, as well as the 
keeping of their correct positioning during the sewing operation. It is therefore obvious that such workings are only entrusted to  
 
the capability and the experience of the operators and that the 
final results are not uniform and homogeneous. Besides, after the sewing, belts have to be hand extracted from 
beneath the operating heads, and sent on, always by hand, to the 
subsequent finishing stages, including the cutting of the 
protruding thread residues and the stacking in the containers for 
the collection and/or manufacturing. Such operations are time-consuming, require much manpower and 
space, are substantially uneconomical and do not contribute to 
the necessary and wished production increases. Object of this invention is to eliminate the above drawbacks. The 
invention, such as is characterized by the claims, solves the 
problems by means of an apparatus for the alignment, ejection and 
dragging of buckles and carriers on belts, by means of which the 
following results are obtained:
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Alignment, ejection and dragging apparatus for sewing buckles 
and belt carriers on belts, characterized in that it comprises an 

interchangeable guide (4) for aligning belt carriers (5) of belts 
(6) prearranged for the sewing of buckles (7), which guide is 

coupled to a transversal ejecting lever (12) and to a traction 
hooking fork (14); said fork being engaged with dragging devices 

(15), which align with devices (19) for removing the protruding 
sewing end, and which align and unload sewn belts (6) in 

collection containers (20). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in that guide 
(4) is interchangeable and has a configuration that may be closed 

or simple-channelled, douple or multiple, depending on the type, 
elastic or rigid, and the number of carriers (5), and in that 

said guide is applied to the slide plate (2), with horizontal 
movements of alignment of its sides with the sewing head of a 

sewing machine, and with vertical movements of pressing and 
dropping of the belts being worked. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the slide plate (2) comprises a transversal support (9) which 

aligns with the interchangeable guide (4), constituting the 
supporting base of the prealigned belts (6), with the edge 

receiving buckle (7) and at least a carrier (5) during the 
sewings which are carried out along the sides of said guide. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 and 2, characterized in that 
the transversal lever (12) has an alternate ejection and reversal 

movement synchronized with the lifting and lowering movement of 
said interchangeable guide (4). 
Apparatus according to claims 1, 2 and 4, characterized in 
that the transversal ejection lever (12) aligns in the operating 

stage with a fork (14) which engages belts (6), on which 
carrier(s) (5) and buckles (7) have already been sewn; said fork 

being integral with a dragging device (15) of the piston type or 
the like. 
Apparatus according to claims 1, 2, 4 and 6, characterized in 
that the dragging device (15) slides along a path which brings 

fork (14) in alignment with a source of heat (19), on which the 
sewn parts of the belts draw up; said source, of the hot air type 

or the like, being adequate to remove the protruding residual 
ends of the sewing threads. 
Apparatus according to claims 1, 5 and 6, characterized in 
that the dragging device (15) which has its fulcrum at (17), is 

provided with a transversal back control (18) whose activity is 
synchronized, as concerns the alignment, with said source of heat 

(19) and with interchangeable containers (20), suitable to 
collect the finished belts (6), unloaded by said fork (14). 
Apparatus according to claims 1 through 7, characterized in 
that the alternate, synchronized and sequential movements of the 

interchangeable guide (4), the transversal ejection lever (12), 
the hooking and traction fork (14), the dragging device (15), the 

transversal back control (18), are programmable according to the 
type(s) of belts (6) to be completed with the sewing of the 

relevant carriers (5) and belts (7) and are controlled by means 
of a PLC or the like. 
Alignment, ejection and dragging apparatus for sewing buckles 
 

and carriers on belts (6) according to the preceding claims, as 
described and illustrated by way of example, with special regard 

to the reservation expressed in the last sentence of the 
descriptive part and for the objects specified.
