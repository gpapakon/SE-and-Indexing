<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a process and an apparatus for metering liquids, in which the volume of a sample drop (14) is determined by optical measurement. The liquid (14) to be metered is brought into contact with a transfer element (15) so that a drop (14) adheres to the transfer element (15). The transfer element (15) and the adhering liquid is illuminated in one or more directions (12, 13) and resulting images are reproduced on an optical sensor (17). The liquid volume is determined on the basis of the images. Metering is performed by transferring the liquid volume (14) adhering to the transfer element (15) to an analysis vessel.

Method for dosing a liquid using a bar-shaped
transfer element or a transfer element with a flat

surface element comprising the following steps:

a) a contact step in which

the closed end surface of a bar-shaped
transfer element is immersed in the liquid

such that a drop of the liquid adheres to
the end surface of the transfer element,

or
liquid is applied to a transfer element in
the shape of a base plate with a flat

surface element so that a drop is formed on
the flat surface element and the flat

surface element is larger than the liquid
drop that has formed
b) an imaging step in which the drop and at least
a part of the transfer element are illuminated

and an optical system forms at least one image
of the drop and a part of the transfer element

on an optical sensor,
c) an optical measuring step in which contours of
the drop are determined from the at least one

image that was formed on the optical sensor 
and the volume of the drop is calculated from

the contours determined in this manner,
d) a transfer step in which the drop adhering to
the transfer element is transferred into an

analytical vessel.
Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the drop and
at least a part of the transfer element are

illuminated in at least two spatial directions
which are not parallel to one another and wherein

the resulting at least two images of the drop and a
part of the transfer element are used to calculate

the volume.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
transfer element is a bar-shaped body having at

least one front side and one outer side-wall
surface and wherein the drop adheres to the front

side of the transfer element.
Method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the bar-shaped
transfer element has an outer side-wall

surface to which the liquid essentially does not
adhere and a front side to which the liquid

adheres.
Method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
transfer element has a flat surface element which

is larger than the diameter of the drop. 
Method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the wetting
angle formed between the drop and the flat surface

element of the transfer element is greater than
90Â°.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1, 3 or 5
for dosing sample volumes in the range 10 to

500 nl.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1, 3 or 5,
wherein the at least one image of the drop is

recorded with a CCD-camera.
Method as claimed in one of the claims 1, 3 or 5,
wherein the contours of the drop and part of the

transfer element are determined from the at least
one image by using a threshold value for brightness

or from the diffraction pattern with the aid of a
spline function.
System for dosing liquids comprising the following
elements:


a) a transfer element which is bar-shaped and has
a closed end surface to which a drop of liquid

adheres or has a flat surface element in the
shape of a base plate which is larger than the

drop of liquid on which liquid is applied and
to which at least one drop of liquid adheres

due to adhesive and/or gravitational forces,
b) an illumination unit which has at least one
light source and which can have an arrangement 

of lenses, mirrors, and diaphragms,
c) an adjusting device which holds the transfer
element and allows movement of the transfer

element in at least one direction in space
within the light path of the illumination

unit,
d) a detection device which detects the light
after this light has passed through the

transfer element and which can also have an
arrangement of lenses, mirrors, and

diaphragms,
e) an evaluation device which determines the
contours of the at least one drop of liquid

with the aid of the signals from the detection
unit and from this calculates the volume of

the drop of liquid.
System as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
illumination unit has at least two beams of

radiation which illuminate the drop adhering to the
transfer element in non-parallel spatial

directions.
System as claimed in claim 10 or 11, wherein the
transfer element is a bar-shaped body having at

least one front side and one outer side-wall
surface. 
System as claimed in claim 10 or 11, wherein the
transfer element has a flat surface element which

is larger than the diameter of the drop.
System as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
detection device is a CCD-camera which can be

equipped with a system of lenses, mirrors, and
diaphragms.
System as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
evaluation device determines the contours of the at

least one drop of liquid from signals of the
detection device using a threshold value method or

spline function method and from this calculates the
volume of the at least one drop of liquid.
System as claimed in claim 10, wherein the
adjusting device positions the at least one drop of

liquid in the focal point of the lens system and
projects the at least one image of the at least one

liquid drop onto an optical sensor.
