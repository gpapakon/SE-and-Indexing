<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to novel polyfunctional azo reactive dyes of the formula (I) 
<
IMAGE
>
  in which     Y is CH2CH2OSO3H, CH2CH2Cl, CH2CH2OH or CH=CH2,   X is F, Cl or OCH3, and   R is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, and a process for their preparation and their use for dyeing and printing hydroxyl- and amido-containing materials having improved fastness properties.
