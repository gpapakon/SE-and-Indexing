<ABSTRACT>
The countertop barbecue comprises a burner (2), which can be placed, preferably slip-resistantly, on a slab (1) of wood, stone or the like, and a support (3) for the food to be grilled, which is removably arranged above the burner. In this arrangement, the burner (2) is surrounded with lateral spacing by a chimney-like hood (4) which is, at least in part, at a distance from the slab (1), projects above the burner, and the side walls of which define with the walls of the burner (2) airflow ducts (5) which communicate with the surrounding air at the bottom. By these measures, with the ignition of the burner flame an airflow is created which acts from the bottom upwards, distributes the flame over the entire burner area and substantially enriches it with oxygen.

<CLAIMS>
Table device for the preparation of foods with a burner placeable in preferably slip-proof
manner on a plate of wood, stone or the like and a support, which is arranged above

the burner to be movable away, for stock to be grilled, wherein the burner is surrounded at
a lateral spacing by a chimney-like hood which is at least partially spaced from the plate

and which projects over the burner, characterised thereby that the side walls of the hood
(4) extend closely up to the plate (1) and together with the walls of the burner (2) bound air

flow channels (5) which communicate at the base near the plate (1) with the ambient air.
Table device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the burner (2) is an
elongate, upwardly open container for reception of a combustible composite or the like or a

spirit burner, which is formed to be elongate, for combustible spirit or the like.
Table device according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the grill stock support
(3) is a grilling grid or rotary spit supported above the chimney-like hood (4).
