<ABSTRACT>
A substrate photolithography system (10) includes a 
substrate handling robot (13,16) which pivots about a fixed point (15) 

and transfers substrates between photoresist coater (21), a 
developer (22,23), and a heating/cooling unit (17,18), all of which are 

clustered about the robot. The end effector (14) of the robot 
is capable of both vertical and lateral movement so that 

individual modules of the heating/cooling unit may be 
stacked.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photolithography systems 
and, in particular, a system for handling substrates in 
the course of applying a layer of a liquid material such 
as photoresist, polyimide or spun on glass, and developing 
the layer to form a mask on the surface of the substrate. The process by which a photoresist mask is formed on 
a semiconductor wafer involves first coating the wafer 
with a thin layer of photoresist and then exposing the 
photoresist with the desired pattern. The photoresist 
layer is then developed. This involves a number of 
heating and cooling steps. In a typical process, the 
clean wafer is subjected to a dehydration bake at 
100-150°C to remove any moisture that has accumulated and 
thereby promote the adhesion of photoresist to the wafer. 
In addition, a chemical such as hexamethyldisilazane 
(HMDS) may be used at this point to improve adhesion 
between the photoresist and the wafer. A thin layer of 
photoresist is then applied to the wafer by spinning. The 
wafer is subjected to a "soft" bake at 90-120°C to create 
a firm bond with the photoresist and dry the photoresist 
by driving off any photoresist solvents. The wafer can 
then be transferred to the exposure system. After the photoresist has been exposed, the wafer is 
subjected to a post-exposure bake at 60-120°C to solidify 
the pattern, and the photoresist is then developed, 
forming a pattern on the surface of the wafer. Following 
the developing step, the wafer is subjected to a "hard" 
bake at 130-160°C to dry the wafer and increase the 
adhesion of the photoresist to the silicon surface. After  
 
each of the foregoing baking steps, the wafer is cooled to 
18-25°C in order to assure a uniform process. All of these steps must be performed in a clean room 
which is temperature and humidity controlled and 
substantially free of dust and other particulate matter. 
At present, the most common system for performing this 
process uses a track to transport the wafer to successive 
stages of the process. Track systems have limited 
flexibility, since the wafers are locked in a fixed order. 
In a less common type of arrangement, various processing 
modules are positioned on either side of a central track, 
and the wafers are transported from module to module by a 
robot which moves back and forth along the central track. 
Such an arrangement is extremely wasteful of floor area 
since no processing occurs in the central track area. In 
addition, the throughput of this arrangement is limited by 
the speed with which the
