<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sight having a day-sight 
part (3) and a night-sight part (2). By means of 

quenching the visible light with a filter, the night-sight 
part in the form of an IR sight can be used during 

the daytime as well. In order to effect an improved use 
of the night sight under daylight conditions, a filter 

(11) with a filter characteristic which quenches visible 
light having wavelengths outside the wavelengths of blue 

light is arranged, according to the invention, in the 
beam path for the incoming visible light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sight comprising
an IR camera which converts thermal radiation which is
coming in towards the opening of the IR camera into a red
visible image, a sight part for incoming visible light,
and means for guiding the image generated by the IR camera
into the beam path for the incoming visible light so that
the visible image generated by the IR camera and the image
corresponding to the incoming visible light are superimposed
and can be viewed simultaneously.By means of supplementing the sight part for
incoming visible light, the so-called day sight, with an
IR camera, a sight is obtained which can also be used in
the dark and in bad weather, a so-called night sight. The
invisible thermal radiation from the terrain is converted
into an image which is visible to the eye. The image is
reflected into the day sight using a beam splitter.Under normal conditions of daylight, the day-sight
image is many times brighter than the image coming
from the night sight and therefore completely dominates
the image of the terrain which an observer sees. Under
certain circumstances, however, it is of interest to be
able to use the IR sight during daytime as well. In order
to achieve this, it is known to introduce a filter, which
in principle excludes all daylight, into the beam path for
incoming visible light. When such a filter is present in
the beam path, information about the terrain is obtained
solely in the IR range.Examples of prior art sights are disclosed in US
5035422 and US 5129309. According to US 5035422 the
incoming light is divided into three different spectra,
namely a visible spectrum, a near infrared spectrum and a
far infrared spectrum. In one mode the near infrared
spectrum and the far infrared spectrum may be activated
simultaneously. There is no mode proposed to activate the
visible spectrum simultaneously with another spectrum and 
accordingly no measures proposed to carry out such an
activation. According to US 5129309 the daylight image is
combined with an aiming mark. There is no simultaneously
combining with other spectra proposed. It is to be noted
that the sight according to US 5129309 also is equipped
with a video observation system involving video and IR
cameras. Infrared blocking and infrared enhancing filters
are to be used in connection to these cameras.The object of the present invention is to effect
improved use of the night sight under daylight conditions.
This is achieved by means of a sight which is characterized
in that a filter with a filter
