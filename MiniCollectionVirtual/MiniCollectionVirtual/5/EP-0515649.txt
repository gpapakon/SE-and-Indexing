<ABSTRACT>
A colour video endoscope (100) comprises in particular: a single source of illumination (10); a bundle of optical fibres (40) to transmit the light to a field of observation; a periodic filtering device (50) comprising three filtering zones (53, 54, 55) to illuminate the field of observation with three primary colours (RGB) respectively, and a fourth, transparent, filtering zone (56) through which the light also passes; a photosensitive sensor (60) for collecting an image of objects in the field of observation; an analog to digital converter (91) to convert to digital form the periodic information from the sensor (60) representative of colour images (RGB) and a black and white image (B-W1), the digital information being stored in four memories (81 to 84) respectively; a colour grading device (85a, 85b) selectiveley combining the black and white image information (B-W1) with the colour information in order to recreate a colour image with improved brightness and contrast.

<CLAIMS>
A color video-endoscope (100) for providing 
color information concerning a field of observation in a 

cavity to be explored, said information being in a form 
such as to enable it to be displayed on a standard format 

video receiver, for example, the video-endoscope 
comprising : 


a single lighting source (10) ; 
a bundle of optical fibers (40) for 
conveying light from said source (10) to the field of 

observation ; 
a periodic filtering device (50) for 
filtering the light emitted by the above-mentioned 

source (10), and including first, second, and third 
filter zones (53, 54, 55) enabling the field of 

observation to be periodically illuminated via the above-mentioned 
bundle (40) with three primary colors (RGB) 

respectively corresponding to light passing through each 
of the three above-mentioned filter zones (53, 54, 55), 

and a fourth filter zone (56) which is transparent and 
through which the light also passes ; 
a photosensitive sensor (60) designed to 
pick up an image of objects situated in the field of 

observation illuminated through the filter device (50) ; 
an analog-to-digital converter (91) for 
digitizing the periodic information from the sensor (60) 

and representative of color images (R, G, B) and a black-and-white 
image (B/W), with the digital information being 

stored in four memories (81 to 84) corresponding 
respectively to the color information (R, G, B) and to 

the black-and-white information (B/W) ; 
a color toning device (85a, 85b) for 
selectively combining the black-and-white image 

information (B/W) with the color information ;  
 
a digital-to-analog converter (92) for 
converting the digital signals output by the toning 

device (85a, 85b) into analog form ; and 
an encoder (93) forming an interface with a 
display apparatus for reconstituting a color image, 
 
   the color toning device comprising three adder 

circuits (85a) for adding together respectively the green 
and blue color signals stored in the memories (82, 83), 

the red and blue color signals stored in the 
memories (81, 83), and the red and green color signals 

stored in the memories (81, 82), and including also three 
subtractor circuits (85b) having their inputs connected 

to respective ones of the three adder circuits (85a) and 
to the memory (84) in which the black-and-white signals 

are stored, with the outputs from the subtractor 
circuits (85b) being connected to the digital-to-analog 

converter means (92). 
A color video-endoscope according to 
claim 1, characterized in that it includes a switching 

device (70, 71) for controlling the storage of the 
information sent by the sensor (60) and converted by the 

converter (91) synchronously with rotation of the 
filtering device (50). 
A method of sensing and processing color 
images by means of a video-endoscope as defined by any 

preceding claim, the method comprising the following 
steps : 


illuminating a field of observation by means 
of a light source and a bundle of optical fibers for 

transmitting light ; 
periodically filtering the light emitted by 
the source using three filter zones to illuminate the 

field of observation with three primary colors (R, G, B), 
and a fourth filter zone that is transparent and allows 

the light to pass ;  
 
using a photosensitive sensor to periodically 
sense the images reflected by the field of observation 

and corresponding respectively to red, green, and blue 
color images and to a black-and-white image ; 
converting the information picked up by the 
sensor into digital form and storing it in four memories 

corresponding to the red, green, and blue color image 
signals and to the black-and-white image signals ; and 
selectively processing the signals stored in 
the memories on the basis of the black-and-white signals 

to tone the colors of an image reconstituted from the 
signals processed in this way, 
 
   the selective processing step of the signals 

stored in the memories consisting in adding the green and 
blue colors signals, the red and blue color signals, and 

the red and green signals respectively, and then in 
subtracting from each resulting signals the black-and-white 

color signals in order to reconstitute a color 
image of good quality.
