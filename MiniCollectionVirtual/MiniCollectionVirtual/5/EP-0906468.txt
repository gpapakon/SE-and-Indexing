<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a set of ribs (33) in a dewatering device in a paper machine, which set of ribs is used to support and/or to load the wire (10) or wires in the paper machine and/or to doctor water from the inner face(s) of the loop(s) of the wire (10) or wires. The set of ribs (33) comprises at least two cross direction ribs (41), which are placed at a distance from one another in the machine direction (F), whose positions of height can be adjusted, and which have been interconnected in pairs by means of intermediate parts (47). The ribs (41) have been interconnected in pairs by means of crank mechanisms (60) placed at a distance from one another in the cross direction of the wire (10) or wires, in which connection the ribs (41) can be loaded independently from one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a paper machine with a dewatering device comprising a set of ribs,
which set of ribs is used to support and/or to load a wire or wires in the paper
machine and/or to doctor water from the inner face(s) of the loop(s) of the wire or
wires, which set of ribs comprises at least two cross-direction ribs, which are placed
at a distance from one another in the machine direction, whose positions of height
can be adjusted, and which are interconnected in pairs by means of
mechanisms placed at a distance from one another in the cross direction
of the wire or wires, in which connection the ribs can be loaded independently
from one another.In web formers in paper machines, a number of different forming members are used.
The primary objective of these members is to produce compression pressure and
pressure pulsation in the layer of fibers that is being formed, by means of which
pressure and pulsation the draining of water from the web that is being formed is
improved and, at the same time, for example, its formation is improved. Said
forming members include various forming shoes, which are, as a rule, provided with
a curved ribbed deck and over which the forming wires placed one above the other
and the web placed between said wires are curved. In the area of these forming
shoes, water is drained through the wire placed at the side of the outside curve
owing to its tensioning pressure, and this draining of water is promoted further by
a field of centrifugal force. Draining of water also takes place through the wire
placed at the side of the inside curve, which draining is, as a rule, intensified by
means of a vacuum present in the chamber in the forming shoe. The ribbed deck on
the forming shoe produces pressure pulsation, which both promotes the draining of
water and improves the formation of the web.Further, from the prior art, what is called MB units (loading element units) are
known, through which two wires placed one against the other run, usually as a
straight run. In the prior-art MB units, inside the loop of one of the wires, there is 
a pressure loading equipment, and inside the loop of the other, opposite wire, a
dewatering equipment provided with a set of guide and draining ribs is fitted. As is
known from the prior art, said MB unit is, as a rule, placed in a fourdrinier wire
portion so that the MB unit is preceded by a single-wire portion of considerable
length, in which a substantial amount of draining of water takes place before the web
passes through the MB unit.In the

A paper machine with a dewatering device comprising a set of ribs (33), which set of ribs
is used to support and/or to load a wire (10) or wires in the paper machine and/or

to doctor water from the inner face(s) of the loop(s) of the wire (10) or wires, which
set of ribs (33) comprises at least two cross-direction ribs (41), which are placed at

a distance from one another in the machine direction (F), whose positions of height
can be adjusted, and which are interconnected in pairs by means of

mechanisms (60) placed at a distance from one another in the
cross direction of the wire (10) or wires, in which connection the ribs (41) can be

loaded independently from one another, 
characterized in that
 said mechanisms (60) are crank mechanisms.
A paper machine as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the crank mechanisms
(60) comprise arm parts (61,62), which are attached to the ribs (41), and a crank

arm (63) between the arm parts (61,62).
A paper machine as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 the paper machine comprises a twin-wire web former having
a lower-wire loop (10) and an upper-wire loop (20) and that the set of ribs (33)

is placed inside the lower-wire loop (10) of the twin-wire web former, in which former,
placed above the set of loading ribs (33),

inside the upper-wire loop (20), as backup parts for pressure loading, there are ribs
(52) of a water drain box (51), which ribs (52) are placed facing the gaps between

the ribs (41) in the set of loading ribs (33).
A paper machine as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
crank mechanisms are placed at a distance (L
1
) of about 50...500 mm from one another
in the cross direction.
A paper machine as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 a
pressure space defined by a flexible belt (46) is formed between a rib (41)

and its frame part (43), into which space the loading pressure (p
a
,p
b
) is passed, and 
that the flexible belt (46) defines the pressure space so that the area of effect of the

loading force is independent from the movements of the rib (41).
