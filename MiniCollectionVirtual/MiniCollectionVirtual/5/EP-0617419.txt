<ABSTRACT>
A biaxial actuator for an optical pickup, 
including a lens holder for supporting an objective lens, a 

coil bobbin mounted on the lens holder, a focusing coil and 
a tracking coil both wound around the coil bobbin, and a 

supporting portion for supporting the lens holder through 
elastic members. The lens holder and the supporting portion 

to be fixedly mounted to a base member are integrally formed 
with the elastic members. The coil bobbin has terminal pins 

around which wire ends of the focusing coil and the tracking 
coil are wound, and the terminal pins are directly connected 

to the elastic members.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biaxial actuator
for an optical pickup to be used in recording or
reproducing a signal to or from an information recording
medium.Such a biaxial actuator for an optical pickup in the
prior art is used to record or reproduce a signal to or
from an information recording medium such as an optical
disk. The biaxial actuator is so designed as to move an
objective lens provided on a supporting member in two
directions, i.e., a focusing direction and a tracking
direction.Fig. 1 of the accompanying drawings shows an example
of a biaxial actuator as considered by the applicants.
Referring to Fig. 1, reference numeral 1 generally
designates the biaxial actuator. The biaxial actuator 1
includes a lens holder 2 and a coil bobbin 3 mounted on the
lens holder 2 by adhesive or the like.The lens holder 2 is movably supported on a base
member (not shown) by wires 4 connected to the base member
under tension in such a manner than the lens holder 2 can
be moved in two directions perpendicular to the wires 4,
i.e., in a tracking direction shown by an arrow A and a
focusing direction shown by an arrow B. The tracking
direction A is nominally along the direction of the tracks.A focusing coil and a tracking coil are wound around
the coil bobbin 3. Wire ends of the coils are wound around
four terminal pins 3a projecting from a side surface of the
coil bobbin 3.In the biaxial actuator 1 thus constructed, the
wiring of the coils wound around the coil bobbin 3 is
effected by winding first ends of litz wires 5 around the
terminal pins 3a and connecting second ends of the litz
wires 5 to terminals provided on the base member. Thus, a driving voltage is supplied from the
terminals of the base member through the litz wires 5 to
the coils, thereby moving the coil bobbin 3 in the
directions A and B. Accordingly, an objective lens (not
shown) mounted on the lens holder 2 is suitably moved in
the focusing direction and the tracking direction.However, in the biaxial actuator 1 mentioned above,
the wiring of the coils to the base member includes the
connection of the litz wires 5 between the terminal pins 3a
of the coil bobbin 3 and the terminals of the base member.That is, it is necessary to perform the task of
winding the litz wires 5 around the terminal pins 3a and a
work of soldering the litz wires 5 to the terminal pins 3a.
Accordingly, the workability is reduced to increase
assembly cost, and there is a possibility of disconnection
of the litz wires 5.An alternative approach is shown in document
