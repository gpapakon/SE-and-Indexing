<ABSTRACT>
Fine polyurethane particles or fine polyurethane 
gel particles, which have been surface-covered with 

colloidal polyurea particles, are provided. They are 
produced by emulsion polymerization of a polyisocyanate 

compound and an active-hydrogen-containing compound in 
an inert liquid while using colloidal polyurea particles 

as an emulsifier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fine polyurethane particles
useful as powder coating compositions, powder
coating agents, an additive for coating compositions or
a modifier for resins, rubbers and elastomers; and also
to a process for the production of the fine polyurethane
particles.In addition, this invention also relates to fine
polyurethane gel particles which are useful as a
modifier capable of imparting, to coating compositions,
resins, rubbers, or elastomers, excellent
properties such as oil absorbance, heat
resistance and abrasion resistance; and also to a process
for the production of the fine polyurethane gel
particles.This invention is also concerned with colloidal
polyurea particles; and a production process thereof.EP-A-0 509 494 discloses a process for the production of a
polyurethane wherein hydrophobic silica is used as an emulsifier
whereby a polyurethane is obtainable in the form of true
spherical particles surface-coated with the hydrophobic silica.Fine polyurethane particles have conventionally
been used as powder coating compositions, powder
molding compositions, additives for coating compositions 
and modifiers for resins, rubbers or elastomers.On the other hand, a polyurethane gel is obtained
by a three-dimensional reaction of a polyisocyanate
with an active-hydrogen-containing compound and is excellent
in solvent resistance, heat resistance, abrasion
resistance and oil absorbance.As a method for making use of such excellent
properties of the polyurethane gel, it is conducted to
blend a polyurethane raw material (polyisocyanate),
which has not been gelated yet, in a coating composition,
coating agent, molding resin, rubber or elastomer
and after forming the resulting blend into a coating
film or a molding, to complete its gelation.The above method, however, is accompanied with
such a drawback that the crosslinking density of the
gel is hardly controllable and depending on the degree
of crosslinking of the gel, the compatibility of the
gel with a coating film or molding may be lowered or
physical properties of the coating film or molding may
conversely be deteriorated. The above method is therefore
limited in its application range.As a method for overcoming such a problem, it is
also conducted to first prepare fine polyurethane gel
particles and then to mix them in a coating material or 
a molding resin. Conventional production methods for
fine polyurethane gel particles includes, for example,
mechanical grinding of a solid polyurethane gel at low
temperatures, precipitation of fine
