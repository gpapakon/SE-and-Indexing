<ABSTRACT>
A printing system (25), for producing prints from a print file designated by a print file 
specification expressed in a first format, is provided. The printing system (35) includes a 

workstation (14) and a print server (25) for storing the print file. An operating system, 
employing a second format, cooperates with the workstation (14) and the print server (25) to 

permit communication between the workstation (14) and the print server (25). A parsing 
arrangement converts the first format of the print file specification to an output string based 

on the second format when a call to output the stored print file is transmitted from the 
workstation (14) to the print server (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a technique for a printing system with an
operating system and, more particularly, to an apparatus and method which permits a print
service application to perform input/output operations on files whose formats necessarily differ
from that of the operating system of the printing system.Xerox® Corporation presently is marketing a server for a printing apparatus, the
server being referred to as the DocuTech® Network Server ("DocuTech Network Server" is a
trademark of Xerox Corp.) This server is adapted to translate a job written in a first PDL (Page Description Language), such as
PS (PostScript) or HP-PCL (Hewlett Packard Printer Control Language), into a second PDL, such as Interpress, for printing of the job on a Xerox®
compatible printing apparatus. At the heart of the server are two interpreters, one of which is
adapted to translate PS and the other of which is adapted to translate PCL. Each interpreter
contains software, written by either Adobe® Systems Inc. or Peerless® Corp. to facilitate the
translation process. Additionally, Eastman Kodak produces a network printing system, known
as "LionHeart™", which employs a print server.The above-mentioned DocuTech™ Network Server couples one or more workstations
with a print server by way of a network operating system, such as Netware®. The print server
preferably employs a print service software application which recognizes files having paths or
file specifications written in a DOS™ format. It has been found, however, that the print service
software application does not recognize non-DOS™ file specifications unless they are expressed
in DOS™ format. It would be desirable to provide a print server, with a print service application
hich is adapted to recognize files that derive from both DOS™ and non-DOS™ based
workstations.Accordingly, the present invention provides a printing system for producing prints
from a print file designated by a print file specification expressed in a first format, including: a
workstation; a print server for storing the print file; an operating system employing a second
format, the operating system cooperating with the workstation and the print server to permit
communication between the workstation and the print server; and means for converting the
first format of the print file specification to an output string based on the second format when
a call to output the stored print file is transmitted from the workstation to the print server.In one embodiment the converting means resides in the

<CLAIMS>
A printing system (35) for producing prints from a print file (63) designated by a print
file specification (62) expressed in a first format, said print file specification including information regarding where the file is stored, the directory(s) which must be accessed in order to find the file, and the name of the file, including


a workstation (14); and a print server (25), characterized in that said
print server (25) is adapted for storing the print file; and that it further includes
an operating system employing a second format, said operating system cooperating
with said workstation (14) and said print server (25) to permit communication between said

workstation and said print server; and
converting means for converting the first format of the print file specification to an
output string based on the second format when a call to output the stored print file is

transmitted from said workstation (14) to said print server (25).
A printing system as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a printer (50), wherein the
call to output the stored print file includes a call to print the print file at said printer.
A printing system as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, in which the print file (63) includes
a first page description language, further comprising a page description language interpreter

for translating the first page description of the print file into a second page description
language.
A printing system as claimed in claim 3, further comprising a decomposer (96) for
decomposing the second page description language of the print file to place the print file in a

printable form.
A printing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, in which prints are produced
from a second print file designated by a second print file specification expressed in a third

format, and the second print file is stored in said print server, wherein the third format of the
second file specification is converted to a second output string expressed in the second format

when a second call to print the stored second print file is transmitted from said workstation to
said print server.
A printing system as claimed in claim 5, in which the printing system includes a
second workstation communicating with said print server, wherein the first call is transmitted

by said first workstation and the second call is transmitted by said second workstation. 
A printing system as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the first print file is
generated at said workstation and transmitted to said print server.
A method of producing prints in a printing system (35) with a selected print file (63)
designated by a file specification (62) expressed in a first format,

said file specification including information regarding where the
file is stored, the directory(s) which must be accessed in order to

find the file, and the name of the file,
the printing system (35)

including a workstation (14) and a print server (25) capable of storing files, the workstation (14)
and the print server (25) communicating with one another through an operating system

employing a second format, characterized by

storing the selected print file to the print server (25);
transmitting a signal from the workstation (14) to the print server (25) calling for the
output of the stored print file, the signal including the file specification;
converting the first format of the file specification to the second format of the
operating system for placing the print file in an outputable form.
A method as claimed in claim 8, in which the file specification includes a plurality of
pieces, with each piece having a length, further comprising


determining the length of one of the pieces; and
generating a portion of the output string with the determined length.
A method as ciaimed in claim 9, in which memory space is allocated in the print server
to form the output string, and the allocated memory space is divided into a plurality of portions

including a first portion and a second portion, wherein said generating step comprises:

storing the determined length of the one piece in the first portion of the output
string; and
copying the one piece from the file specification to the second portion of the output
string.
