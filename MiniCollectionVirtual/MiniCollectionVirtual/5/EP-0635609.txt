<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a door-opening mechanism in a motor vehicle, with an actuating linkage (4) between the door-closing or door-lock mechanism (5) and the door opener (6) located inside the door and integrated/mounted in a part (7), especially the armrest, of the door interior trim. To avoid the need for any fastening means requiring special manipulations in order to make the connection between the door opener (6) and actuating linkage (4), there is provided, according to the invention, a sliding block (9) which is guided along a slide (10) located on the inside of the door and is connected to the end (11) of the actuating linkage (4) located inside the door and which has an actuating member (12) directed towards the door opener (6). Moreover, arranged on the door opener (6) located inside the door there is an actuating member (13) which is directed towards the sliding block (9) and which is in loose meshing connection with that (12) of the sliding block (9). This loose meshing connection can be made directly during the mounting of the door interior trim part (7) carrying the inner door opener (6), when the said door interior trim part is attached to the door interior panel (3), and can be broken directly during the demounting of the latter.

Door-opening mechanism in the door of a motor vehicle, particularly of 
trucks and buses, with an actuation linkage (4) between the door-closing 

and -locking mechanism (5) and a door opener (6) on the inside of the door, 
which door opener (6) is integrated/supported in a part (7), particularly the 

armrest, of the intemal door cladding, characterised by a sliding block (9) 
that is guided along a path (10; 16) inside the door, is connected to that end 

(11) of the actuation linkage (4) inside the door and is equipped with an 
actuation organ (12) arranged towards the door opener (6) and that an 

actuation organ (13) arranged towards said sliding block (9) is located on 
the door opener (6) on the inside of the door, which actuation organ (13) is 

in loose engagement with that (12) of the sliding block (9), which 
engagement can be directly effected during the assembly of the intemal 

door cladding part (7) carrying the inner door opener (6) when said internal 
door cladding part (7) is brought into contact with the door inner plate (3) 

and which engagement can be directly cancelled during the disassembly of 
said internal door cladding part (7). 
Door-opening mechanism according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
sliding block (9) has as an actuation organ (12) an actuation finger pointing 

towards the door opener (6) and that the actuation organ (13) on the door 
opener (6) is formed by an actuation fork, into whose jaw (14) the sliding-block-associated 

actuation finger (12) dips loosely to effect a gear-type 
engagement. 
Door-opening mechanism according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
sliding block (9) has as an actuation organ (12) an open actuation fork 

pointing towards the door opener (6) and that the actuation organ (13) on 
the door opener (6) is formed by means of an actuation finger which in 

order to effect a gear-type engagement loosely dips into the jaw (15) of the 
sliding-block-associated actuation fork (12). 
Door-opening mechanism according to one of the Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that the actuation finger is, at least in the engagement area 

(14, 15), conically designed together with the actuation fork.  
 
Door-opening mechanism according to one of the Claims 2 and 3, 
characterised in that at least in the engagement area of the actuation finger 

the jaw (14, 15) of the actuation fork is tapered, opening out towards the 
front. 
Door-opening mechanism according to Claims 1, characterised in that the 
path (10) guiding the sliding block (9) is formed by a longitudinal groove 

(16) in the door inner plate (3), in which groove said sliding block (9) is 
guided with slight play via longitudinal grooves provided on both sides of 

said sliding block (9), which said longitudinal grooves have suitably 
adapted, parallel base faces (17, 18). 
Door-opening mechanism according to Claim 6, characterised in that the 
longitudinal groove (16) in the door inner plate (3) has an extension (19) 

provided at one end outside the sliding-block sliding path effective when in 
installation position, through which extension the sliding block (9) can be 

inserted into the longitudinal groove (16) during the assembly.
