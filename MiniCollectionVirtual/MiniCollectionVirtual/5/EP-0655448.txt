<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel benzopyran
and benzoxazine derivatives which are useful as medicine.Hitherto, benzopyran derivatives having various
pharmacological effects have been known. For example,
various benzopyran derivatives in which the 4-position
carbon atom of a benzopyran ring is directly linked to
a nitrogen atom are disclosed in Japanese Patent Public
Disclosure (Kokai) Nos. 97974/1985, 47416/1986, 165317/1988,
196581/1988, 201182/1988, 303977/1988, 26578/1989,
38087/1989, 129184/1990 and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry,
vol.33, No.6, pp.1529-1541 (1990). In the above documents
there is described that said compounds have an anti-hypertension
effect and can be used for a treatment for
diseases such as heart diseases.Among the benzopyran derivatives disclosed in the
above documents, Cromakalim represented by the following
formula has recently been remarked as a new kind of a
hypotensive drug having an effect on K+ channel together
with Nicorandil and Pinacidil.
Besides, benzopyran derivatives in which the
4-position carbon atom of a benzopyran ring is not directly
linked to a nitrogen atom are also disclosed in Japanese
Patent Public Disclosure (Kokai) Nos.303977/1988 and
38087/1989, Official Gazette of WO90/14346, Journal of
Heterocyclic Chemistry, Vol.11 (5), pp.797-802 (1974) and
Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol.33, No.6, pp.1529-1541
(1990). Particularly, in the Official Gazette of WO90/14346
are disclosed compounds similar to the compounds of the
present invention containing an amide group or a thioamide
group at the 4-position of a benzopyran ring. The German patent application DE-A-40 18 552 deals with
compounds having K+ channel activating activity for the use
in prophylactic treatment of asthma. According to that
document, already known benzopyran derivatives are used for
that treatment.The British patent application GB-A-2,204,868 discloses
benzo(6)pyrans, wherein the 2-position of the benzopyran
ring is either not substituted or substituted with alkyl
groups.The publication by D.R. Buckle et al. in the Journal of
Medical Chemistry (Vol. 33, 1990, pages 3028 - 3034)
describes a series of benzopyran-3-ol and benzopyran
derivatives related to the potassium channel activator
cromakalim which have been prepared and evaluated for their
relaxant activity on the smooth muscle due to their
potassium channel activating ability. As the known compound
cromakalim, the compounds described in that publication are
substituted with two methyl groups in the 2-position of the
benzopyran
