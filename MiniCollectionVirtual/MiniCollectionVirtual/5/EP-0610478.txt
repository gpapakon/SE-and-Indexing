<ABSTRACT>
A process for breaking closed glass bodies containing pollutants, like cathode ray tubes or gas discharge lamps down into recyclable components in which the glass bodies are separated by types of glass, e.g. the screen and cone glass of cathode ray tubes and other, especially metallic and ceramic, components, and the materials considered as pollutants are removed for further processing, the complete glass bodies being broken down into pieces the size of a hand. Thereafter at least the proportion of the pollutants released or dissolved out on the breaking up of the glass bodies is separated from the broken glass and the other components, and magnetic metals are separated, opaque substances like ceramic, earthenware, stone and/or porcelain are sorted out and the various types of glass are separated in suitable devices.

A process for breaking down closed composite 
elements, such as cathode ray tubes or gas discharge 

tubes, which contain pollutants and which comprise 
metal constituents and glass components, into 

recyclable components, in which the glass elements are 
broken do
wn in a crusher (12, 120) and then 
substantially all the pollutants are removed from the 

broken glass elements in a pollutant separator (16a, 
16b, 160), appropriate separators (28, 48, 56, 40) 

effecting separation of magnetic metals and where 
applicable separation of non-magnetic metals and where 

applicable sorting out of opaque substances, such as 
ceramic, clay fragment, stone and/or porcelain 

components, and separation of the different glass 
types, such as the front and cone glass of cathode ray 

tubes and glass of gas discharge tubes, characterised 
in that the complete composite elements are first 

broken down into pieces of the size of the hand, 
substantially without loss of their surface properties; 

in that at least that part of the pollutants which has 
been released and/or liberated on the breaking down of 

the glass elements is separated from the broken glass 
and from the remaining components; in that subsequently 

the mixture consisting of the broken glass and the 
remaining components has the extremely small pieces 

removed; in that the magnetic metals are then sorted 
out; in that the front glass of cathode ray tubes 

and/or the glass of gas discharge tubes is then removed 
from the broken material; in that the non-magnetic 

metals, where present, are then separated; and in that 
finally the remaining glass constituents, where  

 
present, are separated from the opaque substances, use 

being made of a separator (28) for the magnetic metals, 
a glass separator (40) for front glass of cathode ray 

tubes and/or glass of gas discharge tubes, a separator 
(48) for non-magnetic metals and/or an opaque substance 

separator (56) respectively with at least one 
transmission and receiving unit for infrared light, 

which unit for selection purposes utilises the 
absorption, transmission and/or reflection power of the 

different glass element constituents from which the 
pollutants have been removed. 
A process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the pollutant separator (16a, 16b, 160) comprises 

a pollutant separating chamber (16b) in which pollutant 
coatings are released by rubbing together the crushed 

glass element constituents, in that that part of the 
pollutant coatings which is released during the 

breaking-down and/or rubbing operation is fed via a 
line (18) to a first filter plant (20a) followed by a 

first reservoir (20b) and/or in that gases liberated on 
the breaking down of the glass elements are pumped out 

of the crusher (160) and fed to a second reservoir 
(200c). 
A process according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the released pollutants are fed to the first 

filter plant (20a) by negative pressure from the 
crusher (12, 120) and/or the pollutant separating 

chamber (16a, 16b, 160) and/or in that the removal of 
the released pollutants from the remaining constituents 

is backed up by the use of a first centrifuge (16b) 
utilising the different specific gravities of the  

 
pollutants in comparison with the remaining 

constituents, and/or in that the release of pollutant 
coatings from the broken glass includes the use of an 

auxiliary substance which, after detachment of the 
pollutants, carries the released pollutants to the 

first filter plant via a line, the auxiliary substance 
which has the pollutants removed and has been purified 

in the first filter plant being re-fed to the pollutant 
separating chamber, while the pollutants remain in the 

first reservoir. 
A process according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the auxiliary substance used is an auxiliary 

substance which is inert with respect to the pollutant 
coatings, such as a non-fluid solid substance, such as 

staple fibre, sand or the like, an inert liquid, such 
as water, or an inert gas, such as air. 
A process according to claim 3 or 4, characterised 
in that at least one first nozzle is installed in the 

pollutant separating chamber and sprays the auxiliary 
substance on to the crushed glass element constituents 

and/or causes fluidisation of the auxiliary substance

A process according to any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterised in that after the pollutant coatings have 

been removed from the crushed glass element 
constituents by contact with the auxiliary substance 

the crushed glass element constituents are again 
conveyed out of the same and/or in that the auxiliary 

substance carrying the released pollutant coatings is 
separated in a second centrifuge from the remaining
