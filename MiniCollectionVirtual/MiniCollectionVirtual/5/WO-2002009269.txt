A tuning voltage controller supplies a control voltage to the first and second voltage tunable dielectric devices to control the frequency of an oscillating voltage at the output connection point. In a reflect type voltage controlled oscillator, the first circuit branch is a bypass circuit. In a transmission type voltage controlled oscillator, the first circuit branch includes a phase shifter and is connected between the active element output connection point and the tunable resonator.

 VOLTAGE CONTROLLED OSCILLATORS INCLUDING TUNABLE DIELECTRIC DEVICESCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Application Serial No. 60/219,567, filed July 20, 2000.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to voltage controlled oscillators, and more particularly, to voltage controlled oscillators that include tunable dielectric devices.Communication systems are in need of low phase noise, high frequency, higher power and low cost voltage controlled oscillators (VCOs) for use in transmit/receive modules. VCOs are typically used for local oscillators to perform frequency up or down conversions. At higher frequencies, the phase noise of a local oscillator becomes increasingly important for recovering base band signals with minimized distortions. A high performance voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) requires resonant components to be high in Q value.VCOs utilizing mechanically tuned dielectric resonators are known in the art. Examples of such VCOs can be found in United States Patents No. 4,639,690 and 5,578,969.Diode varactors have been used in VCOs at lower frequencies. Examples of such VCOs can be found in United States Patents No. 5,233,319 and 5,982,244. However, at microwave frequencies diode varactors become lossy and introduce noise.While various voltage controlled oscillator topologies are known in the art, there remains a need to provide VCOs that can operate at high frequencies and provide both lower phase noise and wider tuning bandwidth. This invention seeks to fulfill that need.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONVoltage controlled oscillators constructed in accordance with this invention include an active element having a first connection point for connection to a voltage source and an output connection point. A tunable resonator including a first voltage tunable dielectric device is connected to an input of the active element. A first circuit branch is also connected to the active element. A control voltage is applied to the voltage tunable dielectric device to control the frequency of an oscillating voltage at the output connection point, h a reflect type voltage controlled oscillator, the first circuit branch is a bypass circuit. In a 

transmission type voltage controlled oscillator, the first circuit branch includes a phase shifter and is connected between the active element output connection point and the tunable resonator.The first circuit branch can include a second voltage tunable dielectric device, in which case a control
