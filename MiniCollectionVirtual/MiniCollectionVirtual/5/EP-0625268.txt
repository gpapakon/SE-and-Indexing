<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for rapidly determining during a saliva specimen collection procedure the presence of an amount of saliva, and for verifying that the sample obtained is in fact saliva. Color indication by dye markers and/or enzymatic activation of color indicators (125) provides an indication that at least a predetermined amount of saliva has beed applied to an absorbent (104) and the enzymatic reaction indicates that saliva is contained in the sample collected. Apparatus (100) for collecting a human saliva sample is provided having a dye indicator (125) for signalling the collection of a predetermined sample quantity. Alternatively, the apparatus (100) contains a chromogen capable of undergoing chemical conversion upon contact with saliva to produce a color change thereby verifying the presence of saliva as opposed to another fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
 APPARATUS AND METHOD OF SALIVA COLLECTION ANDVERIFICATION FOR DRIED SALIVA SPOTDRUG AND HIV ANTIBODY TESTINGCROSS-REFERENCE Reference is made to the concurrently pending U. S. applications of the present inventor, Jangbir S. Sangha, Serial No. 07/800,649 and Continuation-in-Part Serial No. 07/814,080 and Continuation-in-Part Serial No. 07/954,700 relating to the apparatus and Serial No. 07/800,647 and Continuation-in-Part Serial No. 07/814,077 relating to the associated method for collecting and verifying the quantity and presence of saliva for dried saliva spot drug and HIV antibody testing.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improvements in an apparatus and method for collecting a saliva sample from human subjects. More particularly, the invention provides indication of the collection of a minimum saliva sample amount as well as providing verification that the sample collected is saliva. The indicator further serves to locate the saliva and to show the sample was properly applied to an absorbent after the saliva has been dried for shipping to a laboratory for HIV antibody testing or drug abuse testing or other viral or bacterial antibody testing, or testing for other analytes of interest.In collecting body fluid samples, and in particular human body fluid samples, it is at times necessary to collect samples in the field or outside of a controlled collection environment. Two such cases are immediately evident, that of law enforcement sample collection for evidentiary purposes and the collection of samples by the health insurance industry for health status determinations on prospective insurance purchasers.In law enforcement sample collection of human body fluid samples, the collection of saliva is potentially useful as a superior indicator of blood alcohol levels in contrast to simple "breathalizer" types of testing. Saliva samples can be saved for future confirmation of the original test results whereas the "breathalizer" tests cannot. For the health and life insurance industry saliva testing is useful as a matter of convenience for the individual seeking insurance. When the 

 sample collection for testing for preexisting conditions can be conducted at their home or within their work site, inconvenience is minimized and there is less resistance to testing.In the insurance industry it has become common practice to send out a medical on-site examiner and have the fluid sample—saliva—collected at a location most convenient for the subject desiring insurance. Heretofore on-site
