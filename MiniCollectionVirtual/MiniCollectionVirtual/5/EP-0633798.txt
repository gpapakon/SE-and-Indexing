<ABSTRACT>
A medical device (2) and method for treatment in which the device has a portion for use within the body that exhibits enhanced properties such as radiopacity for viewing by x-ray fluoroscopy. The portion includes an extended metal outer member (4) having, e.g., a predetermined density and an exposed outer surface and a core (8), including a metal having, e.g., a density greater than the outer member to enhance radiopacity, substantially enclosed by the outer member (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to metal medical components
to be used inside the body, and specifically to vascular
filters including medical wire.Noninvasive medical procedures reduce the risk of
surgery by introducing medical devices to a body cavity
through small incisions or body orifices. The devices
are carefully designed so that they may be controlled
from the proximal end remaining outside the body to carry
out the required treatment at the desired location inside
the body. In one of the most common noninvasive
techniques, angiography, a device, such as a guidewire,
balloon angioplasty catheter or the like, is advanced and
torqued at its proximal end to steer the device through a
blood vessel to the position of an occlusion at which
point a medical procedure such as balloon angioplasty
and/or positioning of an endoprosthesis is carried out.Typically, X-ray fluoroscopy is used to view the
medical device within the body cavity to monitor
placement and operation. The device may also be viewed
by X-ray film after placement. To use these techniques,
particularly with small devices which may be difficult to
view, the medical device must include some radiopaque
material, more dense than the surrounding tissue, to
provide sufficient contrast on an X-ray image. A highly
dense, and therefore particularly radiopaque, metal is
usually incorporated with the portion of the medical
device used inside the body for this purpose.WO-A-9104716 discloses a anti-pulmonary embolism
filter of the type made of an elastic wire with remanent
spring effect. The filter is configured like a spiral
with three non-jointed turns, the medial turn having a
diameter which is larger than the diameter of the two
other turns and selected to be approximately equal to the
value of the semi-circumference of the vena cava in the 
area where the filter has to be implanted so that the
filter is held in place by flattening the vena cava. In
a preferred embodiment, the distal end of the wire of the
filter is provided with a small radio-opaque cylinder,
which is rounded off at its free end, to facilitate
positioning of the filter in the vena cava.In interventional medicine, wires can be used for
a variety of purposes such as tracking, stenting,
filtering, conducting (electric current, ultrasound
energy, etc.) and marking. Desirable attributes of these
wires vary with application, but include properties such
as stiffness, tensile strength, elasticity, radiopacity,
weldability, flexural life, conductivity, etc. These
properties are hard to find in
