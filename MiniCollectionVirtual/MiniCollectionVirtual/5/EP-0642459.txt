<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a suspended conveyor for the suspended conveying of goods (21) suspended on hooks (20) with a trolley (11) suspended from and conveyed along a rail (9) having bearing rods (15) over which the hooks (20) are engaged, with at least one downward-sloping discharge rod (5), the upper end (5a) of which borders the conveyor track of the trolley bearing rods (15) and over which the goods (21) slide under the force of gravity, and with a reception device (6) to accept the goods from the conveying trolley (11) which comprises a transfer pin (30) which butts against the upper end (50) of the discharge rod (5), can be set to a goods reception position at the bearing rod (15) of the trolley (11) which is in a reception position, engaging beneath the hooks, and has an upward ramp section (35) by which the hooks (20) running thereon are drawn off the bearing rod (15). The essence of the invention is that the pin (20) is formed on a coupling component (31) of the discharge rod (5) which can be rotated about the longitudinal axis of the discharge rod and is curved in such a way that its tip (32) can be adjusted between the goods reception and a goods forwarding position.

A suspended-conveying apparatus for the suspended conveying 
of goods suspended on hooks, in particular articles of clothing 

suspended on clothes hangers, having trolleys (11 - 14) which are 
suspended on a rail (9, 10), which are transported along the rail 

and which have carrying rods (15) around which the hooks (20) 
reach, having at least one discharge rod (5) with a descending 

gradient, which laterally adjoins the path of motion of the 
trolley carrying rods (15) by means of its upper end and over 

which the goods slide down under the influence of gravity, and 
having a transfer device (6) for transferring the goods from the 

transported trolleys (11 - 14), which transfer device (6) 
comprises a transfer finger (30) which adjoins the upper end (5a) 

of the discharge rod (5), in a goods transfer position can be 
placed, reaching below the hooks (20), against the carrying rod 

(15) of the respective trolley, the latter being in a transfer 
position, and has an ascending ramp section (35) which allows 

hooks (20) running up onto it to be drawn off the carrying rods 
(15), characterized in that the finger (30) is constructed on a 

connection part (6a, 6b, 6c, 31) of the discharge rod (5), 
rotatable about the longitudinal axis of the discharge rod, and 

has a curved course such that its finger tip (32) can be turned 
by rotating the connection part (6a, 6b, 6c, 31) between the 

goods transfer position in which the finger tip is arranged 
placed against the trolley carrying rod (15) below the zenith of 

the curvature and a goods passing-on position such that it is 
arranged moved away from the trolley carrying rod (15) above the 

curvature, and in that there is provided a retaining device (60) 
which grips the trolley carryingrod (15) and by means of which 

the articles of clothing are held away from the transfer position 
on the trolley carrying rod (15) until the finger has pivoted 

into the goods transfer position against the trolley carrying rod 
(15).  

 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that when the finger (30) pivots out of the 

goods transfer position into the goods passing-on position the 
finger tip (32) follows an ascending path of motion which ends 

above the zenith of the curvature of the finger. 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the connection part is a sleeve (31) which 

is pivotally mounted on the carrying-rod end of the discharge rod 
(5) and carries the finger (30) at the carrying-rod end. 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the finger (30) is constructed in one piece 

with the sleeve (31). 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the sleeve (31) and the finger (30) are 

constructed to be substantially cylindrical. 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to one or more of 
Claims 2 to 5, characterized in that the tip (32) of the finger 

(30) is constructed to be rounded. 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to one or more of 
Claims 2 to 6, characterized in that the finger (30) is arranged 

laterally offset with respect to the centre longitudinal axis of 
the sleeve (31) such that an outer contour line of the finger 

(30) runs in the manner of an extension to an outer surface line 
of the cylindrical sleeve (31). 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to one or more of 
Claims 2 to 7, characterized in that, for the pivotal driving of 

the sleeve (31), a linear drive (40, 41) and a motion converter 
(42, 43) for converting the linear lifting motion of the linear 

drive into a rotary motion is provided. 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to Claim 8,  
 

characterized in that the motion converter is a joint connected 
to the sleeve (31) and the actuating member (41) of the linear 

drive (40, 41), preferably a ball-and-socket joint (42). 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to Claim 8 or 9, 
characterized in that the linear drive is a hydraulically 

actuated cylinder-and-piston arrangement (40, 41). 
A suspended-conveying apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2,
