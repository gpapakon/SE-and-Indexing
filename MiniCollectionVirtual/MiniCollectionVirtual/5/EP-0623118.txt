<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 1,5-benzodiazepine derivatives, to processes for 
their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their 
use in medicine. In particular the invention relates to compounds which are potent and specific 
antagonists of gastrin and/or cholecystokinin (CCK). EPA0376849A1 describes a group of 3-acylamino-1-alkyl-5-phenyl-1,5-benzodiazepine 
derivatives which act as antagonists of cholecystokinin. The present invention provides compounds of general formula (I) 
 
wherein 
R1 represents a phenyl, C3-7cycloalkyl, bridged C7-11cycloalkyl or C1-6alkyl 
group which alkyl group may be substituted by a hydroxy, phenyl, C1-6alkoxycarbonyl, 
C3-7cycloalkyl or bridged C7-11cycloalkyl group or R1 
represents the group XYR4 wherein X is a C1-3 straight or branched alklene 
chain, Y is C=0, C(OR5)2 or C(SR5)2 and R4 is a C1-6alkyl, optionally 
substituted phenyl, C3-7cycloalkyl or bridged C7-11cycloalkyl. R2 represents a substituted or unsubtituted phenyl (wherein the substitutents 
may be 1 or 2 of halo, C1-4alkyl, nitro, cyano, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy 
C1-4alkylthio or (CH2)n R6 wherein R6 is hydroxy, C1-4alkoxy, CO2R7 or 
NR8R9. R3 represents phenyl optionally substituted by one or two halogen atoms; R7 represents hydrogen or a C1-4alkyl group; R8 and R9 independently represent hydrogen or a C1-4alkyl group. R10 represents hydrogen or a halogen atom; m is zero, 1 or 2; n is zero or 1; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof.   
 
the compounds of the invention thus include all stereoisomers and mixtures thereof 
including the racemates. In the compounds of formula (I) 'alkyl' when used as a substituent or part of a 
substituent group means that the group may be straight or branched. Thus, C1-6 alkyl 
includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl or tert-butyl, n-pentyl, 
isopentyl neopentyl, n-hexyl, isohexyl, 1,3-dimethylbutyl, 3,3- dimethylbutyl, 
2,3-dimethylbutyl. For the group R1 the term C3-7cycloalkyl as a group or part of a group refers to a 
monocyclic alkyl group such as cyclopropyl, cylobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or 
cycloheptyl. The term bridged C7-11 cycloalkyl refers to groups such adamantyl, 
norbornanyl or norbornenyl. For the groups R7 R8 and R9 the term C1-4alkyl includes 3-4- cycloalkyl (e.g. 
cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl) as well as straight or branched chain alkyl groups as defined 
above. Halogen in the definition of compounds of formula (I) may represent a fluoro, chloro, 
bromo or iodo
