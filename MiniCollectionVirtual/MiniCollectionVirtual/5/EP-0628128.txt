<DESCRIPTION>
 CATALYTIC SOLUTIONFIELD OP THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to catalytic solutions, more particularly to solutions containing metallic compounds useful in assisting conversion of materials such as those present in emissions from automotive engines.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere has long been a need to employ catalysts in reactions such as simultaneous combustion of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons and the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) which are emitted from automotive engines and the like. The role of catalysts, particularly three-way catalysts, in automotive emission control has been widely studied in the art. For example, Taylor, "Automobile Catalytic Converter", Catalysis, Science and Technology, pp. 119-67 (Anderson et al. eds. 1984) , describes emission control technology, composition of three-way catalysts, and catalytic supports. Conventional systems for converting automotive exhaust gases employ a pre-fabricated supported catalyst, typically a solid stratum of catalyst material, such as honeycombed ceramic structures, which are placed in the exhaust section of the automobile. As the emissions pass through the solid, the catalytic metal present on the strata aids in conversion of CO, NOx and unburned 

hydrocarbons to C02, N2 and H20. However, the solid strata-type catalytic converter eventually become spent, and require removal and replacement in the exhaust portion of the engine. Moreover, structures such as a honeycomb support are complex and relatively expensive to manufacture. State of the art systems capable of carrying out three-way catalysis include those having supported noble metals such as rhodium and platinum metals, with rhodium being a preferred catalyst for the reaction:NO + CO > N2 + C02Platinum is the preferred catalyst for oxidation of CO and unburned hydrocarbons.The noble metals are expensive and in limited supply, particularly rhodium. This situation is exacerbated by the fact that current usage of platinum and rhodium in three-way catalysis exceeds the mine .ratio of Rh/Pt. Thus, reduction of noble metal usage is. a problem in three-way catalysis. Therefore, it is necessary to develop alternative approaches to emission control.Accordingly, there is a need for alternative methods of converting automotive emissions not utilizing conventional additional, pre-fabricated, non-regenerable solid catalytic material-containing supports in the exhaust system of an automobile.U.S. Patents 4,295,816, 4,382,017 and 4,475,483 describe catalyst solutions and delivery
