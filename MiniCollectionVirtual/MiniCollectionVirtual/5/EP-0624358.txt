<ABSTRACT>
A therapeutical container (1) has a first compartment 
(2) and a second compartment (3) with an isolation 

zone (4) interposed therebetween. To lower end 
portions of the first and second compartments (2,3), 

communication passage (6) provided with an outlet member 
(7) is attached astride the isolation zone (4). 

The passage forms a Y-shape. Further, the communication 
passage (6) is provided with closing means (8), 

whereby the passage (6) is blocked. In use, an infusion 
set or the like is connected to the outlet member 

(7). 
The closing means (8) is opened from the outside 

of the container (1). The container is suspended from 
a hanger by hooking it at a suspension hole (5) on the 

hanger. Contents of the first and second compartment 
(2,3) are then discharged through the outlet member (7) 

while being mixed together at the same time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a container fillable with
plural contents hermetically enclosed in mutually-isolated
state within compartments, and more specifically
to a filled container with plural contents, which
contain components susceptible to mutual reaction,
hermetically enclosed therein in a mutually-isolated
manner in advance, said container permitting simple and
easy mixing of the plural contents without exposure to
the external atmosphere upon use.In particular, since the container permits prompt
discharge of the contents at a substantially constant
mixing ratio throughout, the container is suited as a
deformable container filled with plural drug preparations
containing components susceptible to mutual reaction,
such as medical fluids for intravenous hyper-alimentation
(IVH) or components for elemental diet
(hereinafter abbreviated "ED"), said solutions or components
being useful in a closed therapy system.There is a longstanding demand for containers
which permit mixing of two types of drugs or the like
in a self-contained manner immediately before use. This demand is especially strong, e.g., for heating or
cooling media making use of reaction heat available
upon mixing of two substances or for foods or drugs
many of which tend to deteriorate in nature if their
ingredients or components are fed as a mixture to the
production lines or are stored as a mixture over a long
time.Among these, since drugs may be composed of
plural chemical substances, many of such drugs particularly
tend to undergo deterioration with the passage of
time if such chemical substances are subjected as a
mixture to a heat-treatment step or are stored as a
mixture over a long period of time. For example, medical
fluids for intravenous hyperalimentation which has
been increasingly practiced in recent years are, from
the above-described viewpoint, one example of drug
preparations which generally are unsuited to formulation
into single-pack preparations. It is a basic requirement
for such medical fluids for the intravenous
hyperalimentation (IVH) therapy that all nutrients required
for the human body be present at appropriate
concentrations. Therefore, each of such medical fluids
is a multi-component fluid containing glucides, amino
acids, lipids, primary electrolytes, trace elements and
vitamins. In view of their compatibility, their 
stability in production steps and the stability of the
resultant medical fluid over a prolonged period of
time, it is impossible under the circumstances to formulate
them into a single composite
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A therapeutic container (21) suitable for use in

a closed therapy system for hermetically enclosing plural
contents in a mutually-isolated state and, upon use,

permitting discharge of the contents in the mixed state,
the therapeutic container (21) comprising:


suspending means formed in one end of the container
(21);
a communication passage (6) having an outlet member
(7) disposed at an opposite end of the container for

discharging the contents;
two compartments (2,3), a first and a second one, formed within the
container (21) and being arranged for individually enclosing the

respective contents therein, characterised by: the
compartments (2,3) being separated by an isolation zone (4)

provided therebetween, which extends from the one end of
the container (21,31) to the opposite end of the container

(21,31);
the communication passage (6) having bifurcated
portions each in communication with a respective one of the

compartments (3,2), being equipped with first openable
closing means (8)

on a side of the first compartment,
and through which the outlet member (7)

and the compartments (2,3) are communicable;
the container (21) including a further communication
passage (9) having a further outlet member (10) arranged at 

a location proximal to the suspending means and having
bifurcated portions each in communication with a respective

one of the compartments (2,3), and through which the
further outlet member (10) and the compartments (2,3) are

communicable;
one of the bifurcated portions of the
further communication passage (9) being provided with second

openable closing means (8,15) on a side of the second compartment.
A container as claimed in claim 1 in which each
openable closing means comprises a tube portion and a plug

portion.
A container as claimed in claim 1 in which each
openable closing means comprises a tube (13) provided with

a thin walled portion (14).
A therapeutic container according to any one of
claims 1 to 3, at least one of said compartments (2,3) is

filled with liquid contents.
