<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a win indicator 
particularly for promotional purposes. Various kinds of win indicators, mainly used in 
operations aimed at promoting the sale of certain products, 
are known; they are based on the principle of concealing 
the winning message and on the possibility for the consumer 
to remove this concealment only after purchasing the 
product with which the indicator is associated. It is known for example to use win indicators 
constituted by a message, printed directly on the package 
of the product to be promoted or on a ticket placed inside 
the package of the product, which is concealed by means of 
a paint removable by abrasion or by washing with water or 
appropriate solvents. Other kinds of win indicators are constituted by 
messages simply printed on pieces of paper or cardboard 
placed inside the package of the product to be promoted. The surprise effect that these indicators produce for 
the consumer during the operation for removing the part 
(paint or other item) that conceals the possible win 
indication is particularly important for the success of win 
indicators and therefore of the promotional operation 
performed by means of said indicators. A principal aim of the present invention is to provide 
a new win indicator in which the win or no-win is displayed 
with a surprising effect. A particular object of the invention is to provide a  
 
win indicator for stimulating the curiosity of the consumer 
so as to be particularly effective in its use as a 
promotional vehicle. Another object of the invention is to provide a win 
indicator that is simple to manufacture and can be produced 
at a modest cost. Another object of the invention is to provide a win 
indicator ensuring an excellent concealment of the winning 
message. With this aim and these objects in view, there is 
provided, according to the present invention, a win 
indicator, characterized in that it is constituted by a 
tablet that includes a body made of a water-insoluble 
material, which bears win or no-win indications, and is 
embedded inside a body made of water-soluble material. Further characteristics and advantages of the present 
invention will become apparent from the following detailed 
description of a preferred embodiment thereof, illustrated 
only by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying 
drawings, wherein: 
figure 1 is a partially cutout perspective view of the 
win indicator according to the invention; figure 2 is a lateral elevation view of the win 
indicator according
