<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a wireless telephone whose mobile station scans in succession m radio channels, m being less than n, and n being the total number of channels in the radio-telephone net. The aim of the invention is to increase the operability of the mobile station. To this end, the mobile station (MS) includes means (TA, MP) with which the mobile station (MS) can be switched to a smaller number m of scanned radio channels which can be freely selected at any time. Scanning begins essentially with a start channel particular to the base station (BS) and the mobile station (MS). If the first m channels are occupied, the next channels are scanned. The figure shows the power consumption of the mobile station (MS) as a function of time.

<CLAIMS>
Cordless telephone having a base station (BS)
and a mobile station (MS) which successively scans m

radio channels, where m is less than n and n is the
total number of radio channels belonging to the cordless

telephone network, 
characterized in that
 the mobile
station (MS) has means (TA, MP) with which it is

possible to switch the mobile station (MS) over at any
time to a freely selectable, smaller number m of radio

channels to be scanned, 
in that
 the scanning begins with
a start channel (SK) which is the same for the base

stations (BS) and the mobile stations (MS) and is
specific to the base stations (BS) and the mobile

stations (MS), and which is determined from an identical
identification number, and 
in that
 this is followed by
scanning of the next m radio channels if the first m

radio channels are busy.
Cordless telephone according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the number m can be entered into a
microprocessor circuit (MP) of the mobile station via a

keypad (TA) of the mobile station (MS).
Cordless telephone according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the start channel (SK) is derived
from the identification number which is valid for the

base station (BS) and the mobile station (MS), is calculated
according to the same mathematical method, and is

known to both stations.
Cordless telephone according to one of Claims 1 
to 3, 
characterized in that
 the duration of scanning
intervals (T
SW
, T
SW1
) can be entered into the microprocessor-circuit
(MP) of the mobile station via the keypad

(TA) of the mobile station (MS).
Cordless telephone according to one of Claims 1
to 4, 
characterized in that
 a small number of radio
channels is covered during the first scan and an

increasing number (m1 
<
 m2 
<
 m3) of radio channels is
covered during the second and the following scans, and


in that
 the numbers (m1, m2, m3) of radio channels can
be entered into the microprocessor circuit (MP) of the

mobile station (MS) via the keypad (TA).
