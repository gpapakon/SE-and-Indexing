<ABSTRACT>
The communication system (KS) according to the invention, particularly a small ISDN branch exchange, is formed by a transmission unit (OCTAT), a peripheral controller (ELIC), an extension unit (ASIC), four ISDN basic access units (ISAC) and by a microprocessor system (MS). Up to eight ISDN communication terminals (KE) can be connected to the transmission unit (OCTAT) by means of a Up interface (Up) which operates in accordance with the time division multiplex transmission method. The ISDN basic access units (ISAC) in each case exhibit an S0 interface (S0) which can be connected in each case to an S0 interface (S0) of an ISDN communication terminal (KE) or of an ISDN access of a public communication network (ISDN PSTN). Taking into consideration an integration of these individual components into integrated telecommunication chips or telecommunication circuits or user-specifiable integrated circuits, this design or distribution of the individual components provides for the possibility of a particularly economic implementation of a small digital ISDN communication system (KS), in particular up to 15 communication system accesses.
