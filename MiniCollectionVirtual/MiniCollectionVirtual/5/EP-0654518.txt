<ABSTRACT>
In a direct-coupled cyclone system (20), the riser cyclone 
is positioned external to a containment vessel (50). The riser 

cyclone separator discharges separated catalyst to a 
catalyst stripper (51) internal to the containment vessel. 

Means (28) is provided for withdrawing stripping gas from the 
catalyst stripper and passing it under pressure control to 

the riser cyclone separator. The riser cyclone separator 
is inherently pressure stable relative to the catalyst 

stripper. The invention is particularly useful for 
retrofitting a direct-coupled cyclone separator to a 

preexisting containment vessel with limited free volume.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a control method for a cyclone
separator apparatus attached directly to a fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC) riser reactor.US-A- 5,248,411 describes an apparatus for
rapidly separating catalyst from a cracked hydrocarbon gas in a
fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) unit. It also describes a
process for withdrawing stripper gas from an FCC reactor vessel.
A vent orifice for withdrawal of reactor and stripper gasses is
located in an annular space formed around the riser cyclone
outlet tube and the roof of the riser cyclone. The vent orifice
provides pressure stability in a direct-coupled cyclone system.The fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process comprises
mixing not regenerated catalyst with a hydrocarbon feedstock in a
transfer line riser reactor under catalytic cracking reaction
conditions. The feedstock is cracked to yield gasoline boiling
range hydrocarbon as well as degradation products, such as coke,
which deposits on the catalyst causing a reduction in catalytic
activity. Hydrocarbon vapor and coked catalyst are passed from
the top of the riser reactor to a containment vessel, containing 
a cyclone separator, wherein catalyst is separated from
hydrocarbon. In the art, the separator vessel is termed the
reactor vessel or the disengager vessel. The separated catalyst
is passed to a stripper, also in the containment vessel, and
contacted with a stripping gas to remove volatile hydrocarbon.
Stripped catalyst is then passed to a separate regeneration
vessel wherein coke is removed from the catalyst by oxidation at
a controlled rate. Catalyst, substantially freed of coke, is
collected in a vertically oriented regenerated catalyst
standpipe. The regenerated catalyst is passed from the standpipe
to the riser reactor for cyclic reuse in the process.A conventional fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) feedstock
comprises any of the hydrocarbon fractions known to yield a
liquid fuel boiling range fraction. These feedstocks include
light and heavy gas oils, diesel, atmospheric residuum, vacuum
residuum, naphtha such as low grade naphtha, coker gasoline,
visbreaker gasoline and like fractions from steam cracking.Catalyst development has improved the fluid catalytic
cracking (FCC) process. High activity, selectivity and feedstock
sensitivity are demonstrated by the new crystalline zeolite
cracking catalysts. These high activity catalysts have been used
to improve the yield of more desirable products.The hydrocarbon conversion catalyst employed in a fluid
catalytic cracking (FCC) process is preferably

<CLAIMS>
A control method for fluid catalytic cracking a
hydrocarbon feedstock comprising:


contacting the feedstock with fluidized cracking
catalyst in a riser reaction zone to yield a reaction

mixture;
discharging the reaction mixture into a direct-coupled
riser cyclone separation zone, and separating the

reaction mixture to yield a cracked hydrocarbon vapor and
a coked cracking catalyst;
withdrawing the cracked hydrocarbon vapor from
the separation zone;
measuring the separation pressure in the separation zone at point p1 to produce a
separation pressure measurement;
contacting the coked cracking catalyst with a
stripping gas and separating to yield stripped catalyst

and spent stripping gas;
measuring the spent stripping gas pressure in the stripping zone at point p2 to
produce a spent stripping gas pressure measurement; and
passing the spent stripping gas to the
separation zone at a flow rate proportional to the

measurement difference between the separation pressure
measurement and the spent stripping gas pressure

measurement, thereby maintaining a pressure differential
between the separation pressure and the spent stripping

gas pressure.
A control method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the 
separation pressure ranges from 6.9 x 10
-4
 MPa to 0.01 MPa
(0.1 psi to 2 psi) below the spent stripping gas pressure.
A control method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein the spent stripping gas pressure ranges from 0.13

MPa to 0.41 MPa (0.5 psig to 45 psig).
A control method as claimed anyone of Claims 1 to 3,
wherein the catalyst head pressure differential ranges

from 7 to 10

 MPa to 0.03 MPa (1 psi to 5 psi).
A control method as claimed in anyone of Claims 1 to

withdrawing the coked cracking catalyst from the
separation zone and accumulating the coked cracking

catalyst in a vertically elongated dipleg to form a
catalyst head;
measuring a differential pressure across the
catalyst head to produce a catalyst head differential

pressure measurement;
passing the coked cracking catalyst from the
catalyst head to a stripping zone, contacting with a

and spent stripping gas;
passing the spent stripping gas to the
separation zone at a flow rate responsive to both (i) a

first pressure differential calculated by subtracting the
separation pressure measurement from the spent stripping

gas pressure measurement and (ii) a second pressure
differential calculated by subtracting the catalyst head

differential pressure measurement from the first pressure
differential.
