<ABSTRACT>
This device includes an annular body made of magnetic material (1) on which primary windings (22, 23), and a secondary winding (8) are wound. It is characterised in that the inner surface delimiting the central opening of the annular body (1) is equipped with a notch (7) intended to accommodate the secondary winding (8), and in that a separation piece (9) is also provided, housed practically without lateral play in the opening of the annular body (1), so as to close off the notch (7) thus delimiting a housing for the secondary winding (8), and in order, with the said inner surface, to delimit housings (20, 21) for the primary windings (11).

Device for detecting current unbalance, in particular for 
differential circuit breakers, of the type comprising an annular body (1) of 

magnetic material through which primary conductors (11) and a secondary 
conductor (8) pass, characterised in that the internal surface (12) defining 

the opening (10) in the annular body (1) is provided with a notch (7) 
designed to receive the secondary conductor (8), and in that there is 

furthermore provided a separating member (9) located with virtually no 
play in the opening (10) in the annular body (1) to close off the notch (7), 

thus defining a location for the secondary conductor (8) and to define, in 
co-operation with the said internal surface (12), a locating space (20, 21) 

for the primary conductors (11). 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
locating space (20, 21) for the primary conductors (11) is shaped and 

dimensioned in a manner such as to receive the said primary 
conductors (11) virtually without any lateral play. 
Device according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the separating member (9) and the central opening (10) in the annular 

body (1) are shaped and dimensioned in a manner such as to permit the 
said member (9) to be slid axially into the said opening (10) in the annular 

body (1). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 
that the said separating member (9) defines, together with the annular 

body (1), a distinct location (20, 21) for each conductor (or winding) of 
the primary conductor (11). 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that the annular body (1) comprises an annular core (2) and a casing in the 

form of an annular enclosure (3) receiving the said core (2), this casing  
 

being formed in two parts (3a, 3b), each in the form of a half-enclosure 
designed to be assembled together with the other half-enclosure, this 

assembly preferably being achieved along a joint plane (4) transverse to 
the axis (1a) of the annular body (1) by a snap action (5) situated at the 

level of the said joint plane (4). 
Device according to claim 5, characterised in that at least 
one of the half-enclosures (3a, 3b) is provided at the level of its base 

wall (15) with at least one elastic tongue (14) of which one edge (14b) is 
secured to a wall of the half-enclosure and of which the opposite 

edge (14a) projects towards the interior, this tongue (14) being designed 
to locate axially the core (2) received in the casing (3), absorbing where 

necessary any shocks which may be received by the casing, and taking up 
variations in the dimensional tolerance in an axial sense of the cores (2) to 

be mounted in the casing (3). 
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
securing edge (14b) of the tongue (14) is situated in the base wall (15) of 

the half-enclosure. 
Device according to one of claims 6 and 7, characterised in 
that the said tongue (14) is formed during manufacture of the said half-enclosure 

(3a, 3b). 
Device according to one of claims 6 to 8, characterised in 
that the said half-enclosure (3a, 3b) is provided, at the level of its base 

wall (15), with several elastic tongues (14) regularly spaced angularly 
around the axis of the half-enclosure. 
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that it has a novel elastic washer (24) interposed between a base of the 

enclosure and the core (2).
