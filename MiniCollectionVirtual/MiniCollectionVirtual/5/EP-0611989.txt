<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solid processing composition for a 
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material 
suitable for 
preserving the environment of the earth and excellent in aging 
preservability; and to a method of processing a silver halide 
color photographic light-sensitive material in which the solid 
processing composition is used. In processes for color developing a silver halide color 
photographic light-sensitive material, silver halide exposed 
to light is reduced to silver and, at the same time, an 
oxidized aromatic primary amine developing agent reacts 
with a coupler so as to form a dye. Meanwhile the 
halogen ion produced by reducing the silver halide is eluted and  
 
then accumlates in the developer solution. During this reaction 
the color developing agent is consumed or removed from the solution with the 
photographic light-sensitive material, so that the concentration 
of the developing agent is lowered. Therefore, 
when processing silver halide photographic light-sensitive 
materials in series through an automatic processor, 
it is necessary to provide means for keeping the concentration 
of the developer within a specific range so 
as to avoid any possible finished development quality 
variation which may be produced by concentration variation of 
the developer component. 
Usually the concentration of the 
developer is maintained with a replenisher to compensate any 
shortage and to dilute any unnecessary increased concentration. When 
such a replenisher is used, a large 
quantity of a waste solution (so-called 
overflow solution) is produced and is discarded. 
This has raised serious economical and environmental 
problems. To reduce the overflow, it has been 
proposed to add a regenerator to the overflow so that 
it may be used again as replenisher or to use 
only a small amount of replenisher as a concentrated solution. However 
the system for recycling the overflow has 
the disadvantage that extra space for a stock tank and 
so forth is required and, in addition, that the operations  
 
become complicated for a photofinisher. In recent years, 
particularly, it has been difficult to introduce this system of using regenerated overflow into a 
small-scaled photofinisher (so-called a mini-lab.) where an 
on-site processing service is carried out. On the other hand, 
the use of a concentrated replenisher 
may be suitable particularly for a small-scaled 
photofinisher, because this system is space-saving 
without requiring any extra equipment. However, this system
