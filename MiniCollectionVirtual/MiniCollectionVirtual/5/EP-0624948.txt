<ABSTRACT>
A tuner for Radio Data System is including: 
receiving unit (10,20) for receiving signals modulated to a 

plurality of frequencies each allocated to a plurality of 
channels; channel selecting unit (73) for selecting one of the 

plurality of channels by manipulating an input portion (75) 
corresponding thereto; reproducing unit (40,50) for 

reproducing signal modulated to the frequency corresponding to 
the channel selected by the channel selection unit; and 

function setting unit (71) for setting special function 
relating to RDS for the plurality of channels. The function 

setting unit invalidates the special function with respect to 
a part of the plurality of channels. 
Further, it is also possible to cancel all special functions relating 
to RDS when RDS data is not included in the signal. 
It is possible to invalidate the traffic report waiting function, by 
simply pressing the preset key, only for the channel which include no 

RDS data. Therefore, the operation of the invalidation is simplified, 
and the operation does not affect the function of the other channels 

allocated to other broadcasting stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a RDS (Radio Data System)
tuner for receiving signal according to RDS, and more
particularly to a RDS tuner capable of controlling a traffic
report waiting function.There is known Radio Data System which broadcasts
various programs and information. In this system, information
relating to the program is multiplexed with the signal of the
program and the multiplexed signal is modulated and
transmitted. At reception side, the transmitted signal is
demodulated and information relating to the program is decoded
so that user can select a favorite program by referring to
information decoded. In RDS in practice in Europe, various
data (hereinafter referred to as "RDS data") such as Program
Identification code (PI code), Traffic Program identification
code (TP code), list of Alternative Frequencies (AF list)
representing list of frequencies of broadcasting stations
transmitting the same program, Program Service name (PS name)
representing names of broadcasting stations or networks, are
multiplexed with main program and transmitted in a form of FM
radio wave. A RDS tuner installed in automobile receives and
demodulates signal of RDS (hereinafter referred to as "RDS
signal") transmitted, decodes RDS data and performs various
special functions. One of them is an Alternative Frequency
(AF) function in which a station in a best transmission 
condition is searched out of a plurality of stations
transmitting the same program by utilizing PI code and AF list,
during driving of the automobile, and the tuner is
automatically tuned to the station in best transmission
condition. Another one is a traffic report waiting function in
which commence of traffic report is constantly monitored by
utilizing TP code and Traffic Announcement identification code
(TA code), and the tuner is automatically tuned to the traffic
report when it begins. According to the traffic report waiting
function, commence of traffic report is constantly monitored
while user is listening to other sound source such as a tape
deck playing music from a cassette, and the system switches the
sound source from the tape deck to the traffic report when it
begins.FIG. 1 shows an operation of the traffic report
waiting function. As shown in FIG.1, the operation start with
a manipulation of function selection button TA in step S101.
In step S102, it is discriminated whether the station currently
tuned is a RDS station or not. If the discrimination in step
S101 results in YES, RDS data including TP code and TA code is
decoded from

<CLAIMS>
A tuner for Radio Data System characterised by:

receiving means (10,20) for receiving signals
modulated to a plurality of frequencies each allocated to

one of a plurality of channels;
channel selecting means (73) for selecting one of the
plurality of channels by manipulating an input portion (75)

corresponding thereto;
reproducing means (40,50) for reproducing signal
modulated to the frequency corresponding to the channel

selected by the channel selection means; and
function setting means (71) for setting special
function relating to RDS for the plurality of channels,

characterised in that said function setting means
invalidates the special function with respect to only some

of the plurality of channels.
A tuner according to claim 1, wherein said special
function comprises a traffic report waiting function for

monitoring reception of traffic report on the basis of the
signal received by the receiving means, and interrupting

the reproduction by the reproducing means and reproducing
the traffic report when the reception of the traffic report

is detected.
A tuner according to claims 1 or 2, wherein said
function setting means invalidates the special function

with respect to the channel whose input portion is
manipulated more than a predetermined time period.
A tuner according to claims 1 or 2, wherein said
function setting means invalidates the special function

with respect to the channel variation of signal intensity
of which is within a predetermined range. 
A tuner according to claims 1 or 2, further comprising
an FM modulator (80), and wherein said function setting

means invalidates the special function with respect to the
channels receiving signal from the FM demodulator.
