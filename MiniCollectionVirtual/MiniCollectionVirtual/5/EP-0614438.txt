<ABSTRACT>
A dispenser for tablets, comprising a drawer element (7) having a through-going opening (10) for the accommodation of just one tablet, which drawer element (7) may be displaced along a narrow sidewall of a box shaped housing (1). A partition (6) parallel with said sidewall bars the inlet of the opening (10) when the dispenser is operated, and an opening (12) serves as a dispensing opening when the drawer (7) is displaced to align its through-going opening (10) with the dispensing opening (12). The ends of the housing (1) perpendicular to the direction of the movement of the drawer (7) are closed by trough shaped shells (2 and 4), the shell (4) at the one end being at its end opposite the drawer (7) hinged (5) to the housing (1), and being at its end adjacent to the drawer (7) hinged (14) to the drawer (7), and the end of the housing (1) adjacent to the hinged shell (4) being obliquely cut, so that the narrow side of the housing (1) adjacent to the hinge (5) hinging the shell (4) to the housing (1) is longer than the narrow sidewall forming the bottom of the drawer (7).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to dispensers for dispensing tablets one at a time from the 
dispenser wherein the tablets are stored in an unarranged way. From EP-A-0 078 126 and DE-A-29 22 350 are known dispensers of the kind referred to in the first part of claim 1 wherein 
tablets are guided into a drawer which has no fixed bottom, but wherein the bottom 
is formed by a wall along which the drawer may be displaced. The drawer is so 
dimensioned that it may accommodate exactly one tablet. When the dispenser is 
operated, the drawer is sliding along the bottom wall under a wall covering the open 
upper side of the drawer so that the cavity of the drawer is barred from the part of 
the dispenser storing the tablets. When there is no access for further tablets to the 
drawer, this drawer is during its continued displacement passed over an opening in 
the bottom wall, through which opening the tablet in the drawer is dispensed. The drawer is mainly operated by pressing a button forming or being connected to 
one end of the drawer in longitudinal direction. However, it is the object of the invention to provide a 
dispenser which is more easy to operate even by people suffering from reduced fine 
motor abillity. According to the invention a dispenser for tablets is provided, comprising 
a box shaped housing wherein a channel is formed between a narrow side 
wall of the housing and a partition in this housing parallel with said side wall, a drawer received in said channel, forced to an initial position by a spring, 
and displaced into said channel against the force of the spring when 
operated, a through-going opening in the drawer, the upper end of said through-going 
opening being in an initial position of the drawer in alignment with an opening 
in the partition, which opening is surrounded by guiding elements guiding a  
 
tablet from the stock in the housing down into the through-going opening, the 
lower end of which is in the initial position of the drawer closed by the side wall of the housing, and the upper 
end of said through-going opening being in an operated position of the 
drawer closed by the partition and the lower end being aligned with an 
opening in the side wall of the housing,  
which dispenser is characterized in, that the housing has a first and a second end 
perpendicular to the direction of movement for the drawer, which ends are closed 
by trough shaped shells, one shell being fixed on the first end of the housing and 
the other shell being at its upper end hinged to the housing and being

<CLAIMS>
A dispenser for tablets, comprising 

a box shaped housing (1) wherein a channel (11) is formed between a narrow 
side wall of the housing and a partition (6) in this housing parallel with said 

side wall,

spring (15), and displaced into said channel (11) against the force of the 

spring (15) when operated, 
a through-going opening (10) in the drawer (7), the upper end of said 
through-going opening (10) being in an initial position of the drawer (7) in 

alignment with an opening in the partition (6), which opening is surrounded 
by guiding elements (16) guiding a tablet from the stock in the housing down 

into the through-going opening (10), the lower end of which is in the initial position of the drawer (7) closed by the 
side wall of the housing (1), and the upper end of said through-going opening 

(10) being in an operated position of the drawer (7) closed by the partition (6) 
and the lower end being aligned with an opening (12) in the side wall of the 

housing (1), 
characterized
 in that the housing (1) has a first and a second end perpendicular to 
the direction of movement for the drawer (7), which ends are closed by trough 

shaped shells (2, 4), one shell (2) being fixed on the first end of the housing and 
the other shell (4) being at its upper end hinged (5) to the housing (1) and being at 

its lower end hinged (14) to the drawer (7) to press this drawer (7) inward in the 
channel (11) until the through-going opening (10) of this drawer (7) is aligned with the 

opening (12) in the side wall of the housing (1) when the lower end of the hinged 
shell (4) by operation of the dispenser is pressed towards the housing (1).  

 
A dispenser according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the end of 
the housing (1) adjacent to the hinged shell (4) is obliquely cut, so that the narrow 

side of the housing (1) adjacent to the hinge (5) hinging the shell (4) to the housing 
(1) is longer than the narrow side wall forming the bottom of the drawer (7). 
A dispenser according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the upper 
side wall of the housing (1) has a sloped edge adjacent to the hinged shell (4).
