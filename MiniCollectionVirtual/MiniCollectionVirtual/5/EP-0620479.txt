<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to radiation sensitive
photographic emulsions.During the 1980's a marked advance took place
in silver halide photography based on the discovery
that a wide range of photographic advantages, such as
improved speed-granularity relationships, increased
covering power both on an absolute basis and as a
function of binder hardening, more rapid developability,
increased thermal stability, increased separation
of native and spectral sensitization imparted
imaging speeds, and improved image sharpness in both
mono- and multi-emulsion layer formats, can be
achieved by employing tabular grain emulsions. These
advantages are demonstrated in Kofron et al U.S.
Patent 4,439,520.An emulsion is generally understood to be a
"tabular grain emulsion" when tabular grains account
for at last 50 percent of total grain projected area.
A grain is generally considered to be a tabular grain
when to ratio of its equivalent circular diameter
(ECD) to its thickness (t) is at least 2. The equivalent
circular diameter of a grain is the diameter of a
circle having an area equal to the projected area of
the grain.High chloride tabular grain emulsions are
disclosed by Kofron et al. The term "high chloride"
refers to grains that contain at least 50 mole percent
chloride based on silver. In referring to grains of
mixed halide content, the halides are named in order
of increasing molar concentrations--e.g., silver
iodochloride contains a higher molar concentration of
chloride than iodide.The overwhelming majority of tabular grain
emulsions contain tabular grains that are irregular 
octahedral grains. Regular octahedral grains contain
eight identical crystal faces, each lying in a different
{111} crystallographic plane. Tabular irregular
octahedra contain two or more parallel twin planes
that separate two major grain faces lying in {111}
crystallographic planes. The {111} major faces of the
tabular grains exhibit a threefold symmetry, appearing
triangular or hexagonal. It is generally accepted
that the tabular shape of the grains is the result of
the twin planes producing favored edge sites for
silver halide deposition, with the result that the
grains grow laterally while increasing little, if any,
in thickness after parallel twin plane incorporation.While tabular grain emulsions have been
advantageously employed in a wide variety of photographic
and radiographic applications, the requirement
of parallel twin plane formation and {111} crystal
faces pose limitations both in emulsion preparation
and use. These
