<ABSTRACT>
A sigma-delta (ΣΔ) analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC) (700) accepts band-limited analog 

signals (51), and subtracts an analog replica of an 
output pulse- or amplitude- density modulated 

(ADM) signal therefrom to produce an error 
signal. The error signal is processed by an 

analog filter or resonator (758) with a nondelayed 
forward path (763) and a tapped nonaccumulating delay 

line (775), and summed feedback (762) and feedforward (764) 
weights coupled to the taps, to thereby produce 

a resonated signal (208). An ADC (210) processes the 
resonated signal, and produces the ADM signal. 

The ADC undesirably produces quantization 
noise. A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) (218) 

noiselessly converts the PDM signal into the 
analog replica (206), to aid in forming the error 

signal. In a particular embodiment of the 
invention, the resonator (758) includes a recursive 

analog transversal filter with delays and 
linear weighting elements for linearity and 

high operating speed. The ADC (700) may be in a high-speed 
system such as a radar.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to sigma-delta
(ΣΔ) modulators, and more specifically to
analog-to-digital converters using ΣΔ
modulators, in which the locations of the poles
and zeroes in the forward transfer function are
selected to improve suppression of quantizing
noise in general and more specifically for low
oversampling ratios.The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is
an important component in many electrical
sensor, control and communications systems.
Such systems often require high converter
resolution and high speed for best operation.In the past, high speed ADCs used parallel
or "Flash" architectures but were limited in
precision by component matching errors inherent
in the fabrication process. Other known
architectures such as Successive Approximation
Register (SAR) and Cascade are all limited in
their precision by analog component errors,
either because of mismatch or because of noise
and nonlinearity. The component errors
determine the highest possible resolution
attainable with these architectures. High
speed ADCs have greater noise, increased
nonlinearity, and increased mismatch with
respect to lower speed ADCs as a result of the
increased bandwidth of the circuits employed. Another analog-to-digital conversion
technique known as sigma-delta (ΣΔ) conversion
has been developed with a view to improving
conversion accuracy with reduced sensitivity to
component mismatch errors. Sigma-Delta analog-to-digital
converters use quantizers within a
loop, and also include noise shaping filters
formed by the loop. Sigma-Delta analog-to-digital
converters reduce quantizer noise, and
improve the signal-to-noise (SNR) performance.
The bandwidth of the noise shaping filter is a
fraction of sampling rate employed in the
structure. FIGURE 1 is a simplified block
diagram of a prior-art ΣΔ analog-to-digital
converter. In FIGURE 1, the analog input
signal x(t) is applied over a conductor or
signal path 100 to an input port 200 of a
sigma-delta modulator 102, which receives a
sampling clock by way of an input path 104.
The minimum required sampling frequency is
ideally at least twice the highest frequency
component of the analog input signal, in
accordance with the Nyquist sampling criterion.
The ratio of the ΣΔ sampling frequency
established by the clock signal on path 104 to
the Nyquist minimum required sampling frequency
is termed the "oversampling" ratio.
Conventional quantization noise analysis
indicates that the spectral density of the
quantization noise can be approximated by white
noise. Therefore,
