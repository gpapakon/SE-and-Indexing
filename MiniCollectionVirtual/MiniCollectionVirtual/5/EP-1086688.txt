<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pharmaceutical
aerosol formulations and in particular to pharmaceutical
suspension aerosol formulations containing albuterol
sulfate.Pharmaceutical suspension aerosol
formulations currently use a mixture of liquid
chlorofluorocarbons as the propellant.
Fluorotrichloromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane and
dichlorotetrafluoroethane are the most commonly used
propellants in aerosol formulations for administration
by inhalation.Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), however, have
been implicated in the destruction of the ozone layer
and their production is being phased out.
Hydrofluorocarbon 134a (HFC 134a, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane)
and hydrofluorocarbon 227 (HFC 227,
1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane) are viewed as being
more ozone friendly than many chlorofluorocarbon
propellants; furthermore, they have low toxicity and
vapor pressures suitable for use in aerosols.Patent Applications WO 91/11495 and WO
91/11496 (both by Weil) describe pharmaceutical
suspension aerosol formulations comprising a medicinal
agent, optionally a surfactant, and a propellant
mixture containing 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane and
one or more additional components, e.g., pentane, 
butane, propellant 134a, propellant 11, propellant 125,
or propellant 152a.European Patent Office Publication 0 384 371
(Heiskel) describes solution aerosols in which
1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane or its mixture with
propane, butane, isobutane, dimethyl ether, or 1,1-difluoroethane
serves as the propellant. The
application does not, however, disclose suspension
aerosols or pharmaceutical aerosol formulations.European Patent Application 89.312270.5
(Purewal et al.) discloses, inter alia, aerosol
formulations comprising a medicament, 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane,
a surface active agent, and at least
one compound having higher polarity than 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane.U.S. Pat. No. 2,868,691 (Porush et al.)
discloses aerosol formulations comprising a medicament,
a halogenated lower alkane propellant, and a cosolvent
which assists in dissolving the medicament in the
propellant. The chemical formula for the propellant
given in Col. 2, lines 6-16, generically embraces HFC
134a and HFC 227. Examples of cosolvents disclosed
include ethanol and diethyl ether.U.S. Pat. No. 3,014,844 (Thiel et al.)
discloses aerosol formulations comprising a micronized
medicament, a halogenated lower alkane propellant and a
surface-active agent to assist in the suspension of the
medicament in the propellant. The chemical formula for
the propellant given in Col. 4,
