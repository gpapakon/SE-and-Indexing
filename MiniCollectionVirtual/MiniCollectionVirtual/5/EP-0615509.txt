<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multi-chamber
substance containment apparatus for separately storing two
or more substances in one container.Dehydration is a common method of preserving
perishable foods. For example, the usable periods
("shelf-life") of liquid milk is increased from a few
weeks to several months or more by dehydrating the liquid
milk to form powdered milk. Dehydrated substances are
particularly useful when refrigeration is not available
because the dehydrated substances can be stored at room
temperature. Of course, when dehydrated edible substances
are re-hydrated by mixing with a liquid, the shelf-life of
the re-hydrated edible substance is typically the same as
or shorter than the perishable food from which the
dehydrated substance was produced. Therefore, it is
advantageous to postpone the hydration process until the
dehydrated substance and liquid are mixed; that is,
immediately prior to consumption.Fig. 1 shows a prior art baby bottle 10 used to
dispense liquid baby formula or milk. The baby bottle 10
includes an outer wall 11 defining a chamber 12, a mouth
13 defining an opening 14, and a nipple assembly 15 which
covers the opening 14. The nipple assembly 15 includes a
base 16 and a nipple 17. The nipple assembly 15 is
typically connected to the bottle portion 10 by means of
mating threads 8 and 18 which are located on the mouth 13
and the base 16, respectively.Powdered baby formula and water are mixed in the
prior art baby bottle 10 by inserting predetermined 
amounts of powdered formula and water through the opening
14 into the chamber 12, attaching the nipple portion 15,
and shaking the baby bottle 10 until the powdered formula
and water mix to produce liquid baby formula. The liquid
baby formula is then either immediately consumed or
refrigerated for later consumption.There are several disadvantages associated with the
use of prior art single-chamber containers, such as the
above-described baby bottle, for preparing hydrated
mixtures from a dehydrated substance. One disadvantage is
that two storage containers are required to store the
water and the dehydrated substance prior to mixing.
Mixing requires transferring one of the dehydrated
substance and the water from one container to the other.
The dehydrated substance and the water can be contaminated
during the transfer, particularly when mixing is performed
away from home. In addition, in some situations, such as
when mixing is performed in a car, spillage or incorrect
mixing quantities can result because level surfaces
