<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a shaft-hub connection between two coaxial machine components for the transmission of high torques in a drive train, a first, input-side machine component and a second, output-side machine component. The invention is characterized by the following features:   - the two machine components (2, 3) are connected in such a way that they can be displaced but not rotated relative to one another; - a positive-locking overload safety mechanism is additionally provided between two machine components (2, 3), the individual locking elements (6) (at least one) of the said mechanism being preloadable in the locking direction and locking the two machine components (2, 3) against axial thrust up to a certain, adjustable limiting value; - the overload safety mechanism (4) is designed and arranged in such a way that the positive locking is cancelled when the limiting value is exceeded; - bolts with a head surface bevelled in the form of a wedge are used as the locking elements.

Shaft-hub connection between two co-axial machine parts for
transmission of high torque in one operating extension - a first machine

part (2) at the side of the drive and a second machine part (3) at the side
of the output, withthe following features:


1.1 as of a specified axial load, both machine parts (2, 3) are
displaceable relative to each other, and otherwise non-rotationally

interconnected;
1.2 between both machine parts (2, 3) is provided a positive overload
safety mechanism (4) with locking elements (6) by means of which

both machine parts (2, 3) are up to a specified adjustable threshold
value locked against axial displacement;
1.3 the overload safety mechanism (4) is designed and configured in
such a manner that the positive link is lifted when the threshold is

exceeded;
1.4 the individual locking elements (6) are pretensionable in the
meaning of locking;
1.5 each individual locking element (6) is designed as a bolt, cross-sectionally
seen with wedgeshaped slanted head surfaces;
1.6 each locking element is supported by the first machine part (2) and
pushed by the retensional load into a receiving cavity (9) which is

worked into the surface of the second machine part (3);
1.7 each locking element (6) is associated with a receiving cavity (9).
Shaft-hub connection according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
value of the axial load required for lifting the positive link is set by the

angle of slant of the head surfaces of the locking elements and/or the
number of applied locking elements (6) and/or the value of the

pretensional load at the locking elements. 
Shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised
in that
 the pretensional load is produced by a spring element (7).
Shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised
in that
 the connection of both machine parts (2, 3) is configured as a
wedged shaft connection with sliding or gliding seat(1).
Shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised
in that
 the connection of both machine parts (2, 3) is configured as a
roller mounted telescopic guide.
Shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised
in that
 the connection of both machine parts (2, 3) is configured as a ball
guide.
Shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised
in that
 the receiving cavity (9) is of wedgeshaped or conical design.
Shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterised
by
 the following features:

8.1 each receiving cavity (9) is worked into an insert which together
with the second machine part forms one unit;
8.2 the insert is heat-treated.
Shaft-hb connection according to Claim 8, 
characterised in that
 the
insert is an at least two part ring.
Shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised
by
 the following features:

10.1 the second machine part (3) is divided into two sections (11, 12)
which are directly interconnected and have an axial play (s) relative

to each other;
10.2 damping members are configured between both sections (11, 12).
Shaft-hub connection according to Claim 10, 
characterised in that
 the
damping member is a circular spring.
Use of a shaft-hub connection according to one of Claims 1 to 11 with
hinged shafts.
