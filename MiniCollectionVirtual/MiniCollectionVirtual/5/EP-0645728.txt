<ABSTRACT>
An optical scanner (1) is incorporated into the 
handset (4) of corded, cordless and cellular telephones. 

The scanner includes a trigger (8), a scan module (10), 
a rechargeable battery, a digitizer (11) and a decoder 

(12) for reading indicia information such as bar coded 
telephone numbers, addresses, credit card numbers, 

shipping method, etc. The scanner can be used for auto-dialling, 
mail-ordering and keeping track of sales and 

inventory. Another embodiment discloses a portable 
remote controller (10) for a TV and VCR which includes a 

bar code scanner enabling the user to scan in programme 
times from bar code symbols (20) printed in TV guides 

(22). The scanned information is stored in memory, and 
when the time for the programme arrives, the controller 

(10) beeps to alert the user. If the user responds by 
pressing an appropriate key (12'), a signal is sent to 

the television (24) turning it on and allowing the user 
to watch the programme. If the user does not respond, a 

signal is sent to the VCR (26) and the programme is 
automatically recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel telephone set and
built-in scanner assembly for reading and transmitting
data pertaining to bar codes, and further, to a bar code
information processing system implementing such a
telephone set and scanner assembly.Optically encoded information, such as far codes, is
common. As illustrated in Figures 1A, 1B a bar code
symbol 2 consists of a series of light and dark regions,
typically in the form of rectangles. The widths of the
dark regions, the bars, and/or the widths of the light
spaces between the bars indicate the encoded information.
A specified number and arrangement of these elements
represent a character. Standardized encoding schemes
specify the arrangements for each character, the
acceptable widths and spacings of the elements, the
number of characters a symbol may contain or whether
symbol length is variable, etc. The known symbologies
include, for example, UPC/EAN, Code 128, Codabar, and
Interleaved 2 of 5.To decode a bar code symbol and extract a legitimate
message, a bar code reader illuminates the bar code and
senses the light reflected therefrom to detect the widths
and spacings of the bar code and produces an electrical
signal corresponding to the scanned bar code. This
electrical signal is decoded to provide multiple 
alphanumerical characters which are descriptive of the
article to which the bar code is attached or to some
characteristic thereof. Such characters are typically
represented in digital form as an input to a data
processing system for applications in point-of-sale
processing, inventory control, and the like.There are several different types of bar code
readers. A first type, a wand, contains an emitter and
a detector, and the user manually moves the wand across
the bar code. A detector senses the light reflected from
a spot scanned by the wand across the bar code, and
produces an electrical signal representing the encoded
information. Wands have been disclosed, for example, in
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,654,482, 4,907,264 and 4,937,853.Another type of bar code reader is an optical
scanner. The optical scanner is implemented as a gunshaped
device, having a pistol-grip type handle. A
lightweight plastic housing contains a laser light
source, a detector, optics and signal processing
circuitry and a decoder, as well as a battery or other
power source. A light-transmissive window in the front
end of the housing allows outgoing light beam to exit and
incoming reflected light to enter. Optical scanners have
been disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent
