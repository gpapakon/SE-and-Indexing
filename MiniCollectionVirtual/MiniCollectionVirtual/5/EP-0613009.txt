<ABSTRACT>
It is possible to determine acceleration using an array of 
micro-machined elements. The invention described herein 

details how to do so by fabricating an array of structures 
with a substrate (610), addressing circuitry (612), a spacer 

layer (604) forming a well over the addressing circuitry, 
and a deflection element (606) over the well. The deflection 

elements are configured so each element is deflected by a 
higher acceleration. The invention also shows one embodiment 

of the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to acceleration detection and 
measurement, more particularly to a system for detecting and 
measuring acceleration as defined in claim 1. Current accelerometers in use are typically of one of two types. The first type 
uses strain-sensing techniques. These have piezo-electric or piezo-resistive material 
that senses either the stress induced by the inertial mass, or the strain induced by 
the spring supporting the mass. The second type are position-sensing. These 
measure the displacement of an accelerated mass connected to a restoring spring. Both of these methods measure the analog response of the transducer to the 
acceleration to output a proportional signal. Therefore, the linearity and range of 
these accelerometers is dependent on the materials, architecture and transduction 
phenomena of the sensor. These types of accelerometers typically have a sensor element with a mass on 
the order of a gram. Hybrid techniques are necessary to integrate the transducer 
with the readout circuitry. These two factors contribute to two problems with this 
type of accelerometers. They are large in size, by integrated circuit standards. Also, 
they require expensive tail-end processing, making them expensive by semiconductor 
industry standards. These problems have led to the manufacture of a new type of accelerometers.  
 
These typically have masses and springs fabricated from single crystal or 
polycrystalline silicon. The sensors are on a silicon dioxide membrane. The silicon 
substrate is etched away with an anisotropic or orientation-dependent etch. The 
supporting oxide is then freed by wet-etching with hydrofluoric acid. While this technique is an improvement over the hybrid techniques discussed 
above, this method produces a single element that is 1 millimeter in size. That 
measurement does not include the addressing circuitry, which must be put on the 
side, since the substrate has been removed underneath. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide micro-machined 
accelerometers. It is another object of this invention to provide an inexpensive process for 
manufacturing micro-machined accelerometers including the addressing circuitry.  Other objects and advantages will be obvious, and will 
in part appear hereinafter and will be accomplished by the 
present invention which provides a system for detecting and 
measuring acceleration which comprises a circuit for providing 
an electronic pulse to an array of sensor elements; 
said array of sensor elements capable of
