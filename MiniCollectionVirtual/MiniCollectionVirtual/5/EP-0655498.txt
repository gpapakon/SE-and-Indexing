<DESCRIPTION>
This is a continuation-in-part of copending United 
States application Serial No. 08/160,087 filed November 
30, 1993. This invention relates to the field of RNA 
polymerase transcription factors. The invention described herein was made in the 
course of work under a grant or award from The National 
Institutes of Health, and the Government may have certain 
rights therein.  Transcription is the first stage in gene expression 
and the principal step at which it is controlled. It 
involves synthesis of an RNA chain representing the 
coding strand of a DNA duplex. Transcription takes place 
by the usual process of complementary base pairing 
catalyzed by the enzyme RNA polymerase. This reaction 
can be divided into three stages: initiation; elongation; 
and termination. In eucaryotic systems, RNA polymerase associates 
with several other enzymes and factors at a sequence of 
DNA which defines a promoter. Accurate initiation 
requires a number of initiation factors and is an 
important point at which transcription is controlled. Elongation describes the phase during which the RNA 
polymerase moves along the DNA and extends the growing 
RNA chain. As the RNA polymerase moves, it unwinds the 
DNA helix to expose a new segment of the template in 
single-stranded form. Nucleotides are covalently added 
to the 3' end of the growing RNA chain forming an RNA-DNA 
hybrid in the unwound region. Additionally, the RNA that 
was made previously is displaced from the DNA template 
strand, which pairs with its original partner to reform 
the duplex helix. Thus, elongation involves the 
disruption of DNA structure to form a transiently unwound 
region that exists as a hybrid RNA-DNA duplex and a 
displaced single strand of DNA. Termination involves recognition by the RNA 
polymerase of the point at which no further bases should 
be added to the chain, followed by dissociation of RNA 
polymerase from both the DNA template and the newly 
synthesized RNA chain. Messenger RNA synthesis is a complex biochemical 
process requiring the action of multiple transcription 
factors, including initiation and elongation factors,  
 
that control the activity of the RNA polymerase at both 
the initiation and elongation stages of transcription. 
Several of these factors are known to be essential for 
initiation and are referred to as factors d, e, a, g, and 
b from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, τ, α, βγ, δ and ε from 
rat liver, and TFIID, TFIIB, RAP30/74 or TFIIF, BTF2 or 
TFIIH, and TFIIE from human cells. In addition to these factors,
