<ABSTRACT>
To achieve a more reliable and more intense immune response, the agent has, besides the glycopeptide described, a content of a zinc compound and a quaternary ammonium salt in dosage with synergistic mutual enhancement. This combination in conjunction with the antigen is considerably more efficient than the agent described earlier and is simple to handle and is tolerated by the animal without detectable symptoms so that it is possible by frequently repeated administration together with the antigen to achieve antigen yields never as yet seen.
