<ABSTRACT>
A butt welder has several clamps (9,10,11,12) and guides (8,16) to keep the pipes and heater support (28, 29) parallel and coaxial. A heating element (20) in a carrier (23) can be swung about a parallel axis (A2) and has a locking device (32) with a release (33) activated at the end of the heating cycle. The clamps (9,10 and 11,12) are connected to guide pins (42 and 46) which slide in slots (48,49) in guide plates (27). The heater supports (28,29) are attached to the guide plates (47) so that the heater (20) can move according to the free movement available between the guide pins (42,46) within the slots (48,49). The release (33) is attached to the heating element carrier (23).

<CLAIMS>
Butt-welding machine (1) for plastic pipes (2, 3) comprising a
machine frame (4) with a plurality of clamps (9, 10, 11, 12) for

holding the pipe ends with guides (8, 15) parallel to the common
clamp axis (A1-A1) for axial relative displacement of the clamps

relative to each other and with holding elements (28, 29) configured
on opposite sides of the clamp axis for holding a heating element

(20) for heating the pipe ends, and

a: the heating element (20) is mounted pivotally around a pivotal
axis (A2-A2) which is parallel with the clamp axis (A1-A1) in a

support element (23) which is exchangeable with the heating
element;
b: the heating element (20) is relieved of weight as regards its
pivotal axis (A2-A2);
c: the heating element (20) is provided with a locking element (32)
by means of which it is in the hea
ting position arrested against
an upward pivotal movement;
d: the locking element (32) is associated with a release (33) by
means of which the heating element (20) can be released for

upward pivoting after termination of heating of the pipe ends and
their retraction; and
e: the clamps (9/10 and 11/12) configured on both sides of the
heating element (20) comprise guide pins (42, 46) which each

engage with axial play at least one axis-parallel link groove (48,
49) which are respectively arranged in two link plates (47)

located on both sides of the clamp axis (A1-A1), and which are
linked to the holding elements (28, 29),
characterised in that
f: the link plates (47) and thus a thereto connected heating element
(20) are freely displaceable on guide pins (43, 46) according to

respectively available axial play of the guide pins (42, 46) in the
link grooves (48, 49) through the pipe ends which are to be

welded together, and the release (33) for upward movement of
the heating element (20) is associated with the support element

(23) for the heating element (20).
Butt-welding machine according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
discshaped heating element (20) is connected to its pivotal axis (A2-A2)

by means of a radially protruding extension (21), and the locking
element (32) is positioned on the extension (21), and furthermore

the release (33) is mounted on a sidewall (25) of a chamber (24)
which encapsulates the heating element (20) in its upper position

and triggered by remote control. 
Butt-welding machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the
release (33) comprises a locking latch (34), which protrudes into the

pivotal path of the locking element (32) and is displaceable parallel
to the pivotal axis (A2-A2) and retractable from the pivotal path by

a remote control pulse.
Butt-welding machine according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the
locking latch (34) is provided with an electromagnetic drive (42).
Butt-welding machine according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that
 the
locking latch (34) is provided with a hydraulic drive.
Butt-welding machine according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the
release (33) is accommodated in a complementary housing (40)

configured on the sidewall (25) of the chamber (24).
