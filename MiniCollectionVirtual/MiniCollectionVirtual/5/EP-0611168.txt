<ABSTRACT>
There are provided a method of extracting essential 
oil-rich hop extract from hop, using supercritical or 

subcritical carbon dioxide as the solvent, the above 
mentioned essential oil-rich hop extract, and a product 

comprising a mixture of the hop extract and a hop extract 
residue. There is also provided a method of applying the 

product to the production of wort or beer. The 
extraction is carried out either in one stage controlling 

the pressure of the carbon dioxide in the extraction tank 
at 80 - 100 kg/cm², or performing the extraction at a 

pressure of over 100 kg/cm² and conducting the separation 
in two stages. 
It is possible to produce beer having a pleasant, 
flowery hop fragrance and a refreshing, deep-bodied hop 

flavor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the production of an essential oil-rich hop extract which 
is used in the production of beer, to a process for 
applying the above hop extract to the process of beer 
manufacture, and to a process for the production of 
beer. Hops, one of the major raw ingredients of beer, 
are used to impart to beer its characteristic aroma and 
refreshingly bitter taste, and they are usually boiled 
together with wort during the beer manufacturing process, 
just prior to fermentation. When hops are boiled 
together with wort, the aroma-imparting essential oil 
components and refreshing bitterness-imparting bitter 
components contained therein are extracted into the wort, 
and these extracted components undergo continuous 
reactions involving thermal decomposition and heat 
isomerization, to produce wort having its characteristic 
aroma and bitter taste. However, since raw hops undergo oxidative 
deterioration very readily making their preservation 
extremely difficult, and they also have a limited 
harvesting period, hops for use in the manufacture of 
beer are stored in the form of whole hops which have been 
dried after harvesting, or further processed hop flour, 
hop pellets, etc. Nevertheless, because even these dried 
hops are very readily deteriorated by oxidation and the 
products of the deterioration by oxidation give a 
deteriorated odor and rough taste to the beer, it is 
necessary to maintain a strict temperature and control 
over degassing during storage, and therefore recently 
attempt have been made to extract only the useful  
 
components from the hops, and use the extract in the 
manufacture of beer. The components of hops which are desired for 
beer are largely classified into two components which 
impart a refreshingly bitter taste, represented by 
α-acid, and essential oil components which impart a 
characteristic aroma. Methods of extraction of the 
useful components from hops, considering the bitterness-imparting 
components, include extraction with organic 
solvent and extraction using, for example, carbon dioxide 
in a supercritical or subcritical state. Extraction with 
organic solvent has been accompanied by problems due to 
the simultaneous extraction of other components which 
have a detrimental influence on the beer, such as 
impairment of the color tone to the beer and the 
introduction of a rough taste thereto, and by other 
problems such as residue of the extraction solvent which 
is harmful to the human body, and quality deterioration 
and
