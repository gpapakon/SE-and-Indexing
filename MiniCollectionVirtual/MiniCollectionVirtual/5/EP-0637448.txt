<ABSTRACT>
Glycinamide and the N-acetyl derivative thereof possess analgesic and 
antiinflammatory activity. 
These two substances enhance in considerable amount the activity of well-known 
active principles of analgesic non-narcotic and antiinflammatory non-steroidal type.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions with analgesic, 
antiphlogistic and antirheumatic activity and, particularly, the use of glycine 
derivatives in combination with analgesic, non-narcotic or non-steroidal 
antiinflammatory drugs. To relieve both acute and chronic pain, a wide range of drugs capable of reducing 
or resolving this symptom is presently available: narcotic analgesics, non-narcotic 
analgesics active on the central system, local anaesthetics, anticephalea and 
non-steroidal antiinflammatory analgesic drugs. The narcotic analgesics are normally employed in the therapy of oncological or 
anyhow relentless pain. The non-narcotic analgesics active on the central system are 
carefully used because of a number of side effects. The anticephalea drugs are solely indicated in some cephalea forms. The non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) represent nowadays the first 
choice drugs owing to the peculiar pharmacological profile that highlighted their 
multidirectional analgesic mechanism. The NSAIDs develop very useful effects by virtue of their multiple action 
mechanisms: inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, inhibition of lysosomial enzymes, 
inhibition of chemotaxis, inhibition of complement activation, inhibition of free 
radicals formation (for some of them). It cannot be lastly forgotten that, on inflammatory pains, typical of arthroreumatic 
diseases, the FANS, because of their powerful antiinflammatory action, produce a 
twofold antalgic effect: antiphlogistic and visceral-peripheral analgesic. Some unfavourable aspects are however associated with the pharmacological properties, 
such as lesive effects on the gastrointestinal system, a limited action time (this last 
obstacle being only apparently overcome with the parenteral use which, by the way, 
is not usually feasible). Glycine is a natural amminoacid that until now has been used in the technique of 
pharmaceutical preparations as excipient, especially in the case of active principles 
dosed in very small quantities or in the case of lyophilized preparations. From the activity point of view, however, only a behaviour as inhibiting 
neurotransmitter at the spinal cord level has been noticed for this aminoacid. It is therefore evident that both glycine and derivatives thereof have not been of 
interest until now from the therapeutical point of view: among these derivatives 
glycinamide and its acetyl derivative are to be mentioned. Recent researches carried out by the inventors evidenced surprisingly that,
