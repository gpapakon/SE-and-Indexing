<ABSTRACT>
A system oscillator gating technique is provided for a power 
management unit of a computer system for controlling the 

application of power to a system oscillator. An output signal 
from the power management unit is provided to turn off the 

external system oscillator when the computer system is in a 
power-conserving suspend state and to turn on the external system 

oscillator on when the computer system resumes to a ready state. 
Counters are provided to control the latency of the output signal 

when the power management unit enters and exits the suspend 
state. This latency provides time for the microprocessor clock 

and/or other clock signals associated with the system oscillator 
to shut off prior to the oscillator shutdown and provides time 

for the oscillator to stabilize prior to the restarting of the 
clock signal. As a result, power consumption of the computer 

system may be reduced while proper clock generation for the 
computer system is maintained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to computer systems and more particularly to power
management techniques employed within computer systems.Electronic Design, vol 32, no.220, October 1984, pages 185-191 entitled
"Advanced clock controller cuts power needs, size of static CMOS systems" describes
a CMOS clock signal generator (the 82C85) comprising the features of the preamble
of accompanying claim 1.JP-A-03 077113 (2 April 1991), US-A-4 758 945 (19 July 1988) and JP-A-56
147220 (16 November 1981) also disclose relevant prior art.An on-going developmental goal of manufacturers has been to reduce the
power consumption of computer systems. Reducing power consumption typically
reduces heat generation of the system, thereby increasing reliability and decreasing
costs. In addition, power reduction has been particularly important in maximizing the
operating life of battery-powered portable computer systems.Various techniques have been devised for reducing the power consumption of
computer systems. These techniques include increasing the integration of circuitry
and incorporation of improved circuitry and power management units (PMU's). One
specific power reduction technique involves the capability of stopping clock signals
that drive inactive circuit portions such as the microprocessor, a system memory, and
a disk controller. A system employing such a technique typically includes a power
management unit that detects or predicts when the microprocessor, the system
memory, and the disk controller will be inactive, and accordingly stops the clock
signals at appropriate times. By turning off "unused" clock signals that drive the
inactive circuit portions, overall power consumption of the system is decreased. A
similar technique involves removing the power supplied to the microprocessor, the
system memory, and the disk controller when they are inactive. Despite this, conventional computer systems do not remove power from the
system oscillators during power management modes. Accordingly, in conventional
computer systems, power is wasted when power is applied to the system oscillators
when the corresponding clock signals are unused.The invention is defined in the appended claims.The problems outlined above are in a large part solved by a computer system
employing a system oscillator gating technique in accordance with the present
invention. In one embodiment, digital hardware is utilized to control the removal and
reapplication of power to the system oscillator. Specifically an output signal from a
power management unit is
