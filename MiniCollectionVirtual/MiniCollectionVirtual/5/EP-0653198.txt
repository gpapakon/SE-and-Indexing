<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a safety device for electrical circuits for supplying loads, in particular miniature lasers for human and veterinary medical application, in particular for acupuncture and treatment of wounds. At least one switch is built into the circuit, which switch is formed by an electrically conductive pin 17 which can be inserted through a slit 18 in an electrically conductive housing 5, 6 containing the load, a contact 19 electrically connected to the load being placed in the path of the pin 17.

<CLAIMS>
Laser, of which the laser diode (1) is arranged together with a battery (9) supplying the
laser diode (1) in a housing (5, 6), which is provided with an on/off switch for opening and

closing the power circuit supplied by the battery (9), and with a safety device likewise arranged in

the housing (5,6) of the laser, 
characterised in that
 the safety device is designed as a switch in
the form of an electrically-conductive pin (17), which can be introduced into the housing (5, 6) of

the laser through a slot arranged on the housing (5,6), and in the introduced state connects two
contacts located in the circuit of the battery (9), which are arranged in the housing (5,6), which is

incorporated into the circuit as a conductive element, whereby one of the contacts which is to be
connected by the electrically conductive pin (17) is the area in contact with the pin (17), and the

second of the contacts which is to be connected by the pin (17) is a pole (19) of the battery (9),
which supplies the laser diode (1), and which is supported at the pin (17) which has been pushed

in, and is mounted in a manner such as to be displaceable in the housing (5,6) against the
pressure of a spring (10), said battery being in conductive contact with its other pole with the

housing (5, 6) via the laser diode (1), whereby the pin (17) in the inserted state is in contact with
the pole (19)first referred to of the battery (9), and in this position is secured 
in that
 the pin (17) is
formed from the flag of a key (16), which is provided with flat ribs (20), which can be introduced

through the slot (18) in the housing (5,6), and, after rotation, are supported on the under side of
the housing part (6) exhibiting the slot (18), said housing part being designed in particular as a

screw cap.
Laser according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
, when the pin (17) is removed from the 
housing (5, 6), the battery (9) is supported at a stop element (15), consisting of electrically

insulating material, under the pressure of the spring (10).
Laser according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the stop element (15) is formed from
insulating material as a ring, and is inserted into the part of the housing (6) exhibiting the slot

(18).
