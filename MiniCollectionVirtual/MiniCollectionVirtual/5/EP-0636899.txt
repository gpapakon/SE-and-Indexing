<ABSTRACT>
A Doppler microwave sensor for a vehicle alarm employs a mixer stage (20) 
and a signal-processing stage (60) on a printed circuit board (80), the printed circuit 

board (80) having a ground plane (81) containing a slot antenna (83) which is coupled 
to the mixer stage (20). The ground plane (81) is electrically connected to an 

electrically conductive enclosure (84) which is disposed behind the slot antenna (83) 
and encloses the component parts of the mixer and signal-processing stages (20, 60). 

A dielectric lens (90) may be placed over the slot antenna (83) to provide a 
transmission beam pattern which is configured to the vehicle (110) in which the sensor 

is to be used. 
In a preferred embodiment, the mixer stage is based around a self-oscillating 
mixer arrangement (20) in which the active element is a bipolar transistor (32) and a 

single antenna (22) is employed both to transmit the oscillator signal and to receive the 
Doppler-shifted return signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a Doppler microwave sensor, and in particular to a 
Doppler microwave sensor as used in a vehicle intruder alarm. A number of techniques are known for warning against the presence of 
intruders, the most common of which involve the use of ultrasonic and/or passive infra-red 
sensors. While being relatively inexpensive to make and install, these devices are 
prone to false alarms due to environmental changes such as temperature fluctuations 
and, in the case of ultrasonics-based alarms, air pressure fluctuations. In addition to 
increasing the likelihood of false alarms, environmental changes such as temperature 
variations also lead to undesirable changes in alarm sensitivity. Microwave sensors are available, but up to now these have been relatively 
expensive and have produced only marginal improvement over the more common 
ultrasonic and infra-red types. They have also failed to meet official specifications 
regarding EMC (electromagnetic compatibility) and frequency stability. A conventional Doppler sensor arrangement is shown in Figure 1. In Figure 
1, the output of a microwave oscillator 12 is fed to a transmit antenna 14 through a 
coupler 13, after being first amplified, if necessary, in an amplifier 15. A return 
signal, which may differ from the transmitted frequency where movement has occurred 
within the space illuminated by the transmitted signal, is received on a receive antenna 
16 and fed to a mixer 17 where it is mixed with the coupled local oscillator signal 12 
at an input 11 to generate a baseband IF signal on a line 18. The IF signal on line 18  
 
is then taken to a signal processing stage 19 which provides an indication, 
usually audible, that movement has taken place. The use of two antennas and a separate mixer and oscillator add to the 
complexity and hence cost of the conventional arrangement. In addition, such known 
arrangements have, up to now, had poor frequency stability and have been prone to 
false alarms due to factors such as electromagnetic interference entering the alarm and 
the alarm being triggered by the movement of targets located outside the 
vehicle being monitored. According to a first aspect of the invention, there is provided a Doppler 
microwave sensor characterised by comprising a mixer stage and a signal processing 
stage following the mixer stage, the mixer stage and the signal processing stage being 
mounted on a printed circuit board, the printed circuit board having a ground plane, 
in which is configured a slot antenna
