<ABSTRACT>
A lens assembly is connected to a housing 
containing an image sensor by a flexure means which 

provides for universal flexure of the lens assembly 
relative to the housing. A pair of compound screws 

rigidly couple the lens assembly to the housing and are 
rotatable to displace the lens assembly relative to the 

housing on said flexure means.

<DESCRIPTION>
Reference is made to the following commonly 
assigned copending applications: 
1. US-A-4,809,064, entitled ENLARGING PHOTOGRAPHIC 
PRINTER, filed November 19, 1987, in the names of Shaun 
M. Amos, Richard J. Backus and Thomas C. Jessop. 2. US-A-4,821,073, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS 
FOR MEASURING CHARACTERISTICS OF PHOTOGRAPHIC 
NEGATIVES, filed November 19, 1987 in the names of 
Patrick A. Cosgrove and Richard J. Backus. 3. US-A-4,913,527, entitled LENS FOCUS ADJUSTMENT 
MEANS, filed September 19, 1988 in the name of Thomas 
C. Jessop. 4. US-A-4,893,927, entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS 
FOR ALIGNING A ZOOM LENS WITH AN IMAGE SENSOR, filed 
January 3, 1989 in the name of Martin L. Miller. This invention relates to adjustment apparatus and 
more specifically to apparatus for adjusting a lens 
relative to an image sensing device in a video camera. In a video camera employing a solid state image 
sensor and a zoom lens, it is important to have the 
optical center of the zoom lens line up with the optical 
center of the sensor. If there is error in alignment, 
the image will wander on the video screen when the user 
changes the magnification of the zoom lens while 
composing. Wander of the image produces composition 
error. Such errors are not significant in video cameras  
 
used for recording moving scenes since the user simply 
aims the camera to compensate for zoom induced scene 
shifts. However, in the case of precision systems for 
making enlargements from prints of the type disclosed in 
commonly assigned copending applications Serial Nos. 
122,995 and 122,996, such misalignments can result in 
prints that do not correspond with images that appeared 
on the monitor during composition of the images. US-A-3,407,018 discloses an angular positioning 
apparatus having an optical element mounted on a beam 
supported at both ends by taut-band flexure pivots and a 
lever supported at one end by a taut-band flexure pivot 
and supporting one of the beam flexure pivots with the 
beam and lever arranged so that the optical element is 
rotatable about its axis by turning adjustment screws. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a simple and reliable device for aligning the optical 
centers of two devices. According to the present invention, there is 
provided an optical apparatus for adjusting an optical 
assembly as defined in claim 1. Essentially, in the disclosed embodiment of the 
invention, a lens assembly is connected to a housing 
containing an image sensor by a flegure means providing 
for
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Optical apparatus comprising: 
   a housing (10); 

   an optical assembly (12) defining an optical 
axis; 

   flexure means (18) positioned between the 
optical assembly (12) and the housing (10) for 

permitting universal displacement of the optical 
assembly relative to the housing by displacement means 

(30) in such a way that the angle of the optical axis of 
the optical assembly is adjustable relative to the 

housing; said flexure means (18) comprises 
   a first ring member (20) attachable to said 

optical assembly (12); 
   a second ring member (22); 

   first yieldable means (24) connecting said 
second ring to said first ring member to permit movement 

of said first ring member relative to said second ring 
in a first direction; 

   a third ring member (26) attachable to said 
camera; and 

   second yieldable means (28) connecting said 
second ring member to said third ring member to permit 

movement of said second ring member relative to said 
third ring member in a second direction; said apparatus 

being characterized in that 
   said ring members (20, 22, 26) of said flexure 

means (18) are arranged coaxially and/or axially to the 
optical axis of the optical assembly (12); and 

   said flexure means (18) does not comprise 
displacement means (30) as an integral part. 
Optical apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 

wherein said first and second yieldable means each 
comprise a pair of diametrically opposite flexible tabs 

(24, 28) extending between the ring members (20, 22, 26) 
they connect. 
Optical apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 
wherein said ring members and said tabs are integrally 

formed as a single unitary structure. 
Optical apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein said displacement means (30) includes a pair of 

compound screws (30) each having two threaded portions 
(32, 34) of different pitch, one of the threaded 

portions of each screw being threaded in the housing 
(10) and the other threaded portion of each screw being 

threaded in the optical assembly (12), said screws being 
angularly spaced relative to the optical axis of the 

optical assembly to provide for the displacement of the 
optical assembly relative to the housing permitted by 

said flexure means (18).
