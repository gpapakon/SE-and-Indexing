<ABSTRACT>
A two-part electrical connector is provided with contact elements having butting contacting surfaces for making electrical contact between the two parts. In one of the two parts, at least one of the elements has a contacting surface which is laterally displaceable relative to a principal axis of the contact element and which may also be axially displaceable along the same principal axis of the contact element. In the other of the two parts, at least one of the elements has a contacting surface angled to a principal axis of the contact element. A wiping action is thereby provided between the respective contacting surfaces of the two contact elements when the two parts of the connector engage. The connector may be employed with mobile or portable equipment, where the first part of the connector is associated with other equipment, and the other part of the connector is mounted upon the mobile or portable equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECTRICAL CONNECTORThe present invention relates to electrical connectors and more particularly to two-part electrical connectors for use with mobile or portable equipment. The need to make occasional electrical connection to otherwise self-contained mobile or portable equipment, for example to incorporate the equipment in a larger equipment, to enable batteries within the equipment to be periodically charged, or to enable external testing of the equipment, calls for a connector upon the body of the equipment which does not interfere with the normal handling and use of the equipment, and which may be sealed to prevent the ingress of dirt or wet into the interior of the equipment. At the same time such a connector must be able to make ready and reliable contact with a complementary connector associated with other equipment, even though such a requirement may be infrequent.According to one aspect of the invention a two-part electrical connector includes a first part comprising a first contact element having a contacting surface adapted to make butting contact with a contacting surface of a second contact element comprised in the second part, the contacting surface of the first contact element being capable of lateral movement relative to a principal axis of the first contact element, and the contacting surface of the second contact element being angled relative to a principal axis of the second contact element, such that 

when the respective contacting surfaces of the first and second contact elements make butting contact, at least part of the contacting surface of the first contact element is displaced across at least part of the contacting surface of the second contact element, thereby providing a surface wiping action in order to clean one or both of the contacting surfaces. At least one of the two contact elements may be capable of axial displacement along its principal axis thereby to provide a positive engagement pressure between the two contacting surfaces.The invention provides a two-part electrical connector particularly appropriate for irregular use, where the second part is mounted upon mobile or portable equipment, and the connection to it of the first part causes the contacting surfaces to be wiped together in a cleaning action, to ensure a more certain electrical contact than might otherwise be the case.These and other aspects of the invention will be described with reference to the specific embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings of which:Figures 1, 2 and 3 show, respectively, the

CLAIMS :
1. A two-part electrical connector, one part comprising a first contact element having a contacting surface adapted to make butting contact with a contacting surface of a second contact element comprised in the other part, the contacting surface of the first contact element being capable of lateral movement relative to a principal axis of the first contact element, and the contacting surface of the second contact element being angled relative to a principal axis of the second contact element, such that when the respective contacting surfaces of the first and the second contact elements make butting contact, the contacting surface of the first contact element is displaced at least partly across the contacting surface of the second contact element, thereby providing a surface wiping action in order to clean one or both of the contacting surfaces.
2. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with
Claim 1 in which at least one of the two contact elements is axially displaceable along its principal axis, thereby to provide a positive engagement pressure between the two contacting surfaces. 


 3. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with Claim 2 in which the first contact element is axially _ displaceable.
4. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with Claim 3 in which the axial displacement is provided by a resilient section forming part of the first contact element.
5. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with Claim 4 in which the resilient section is serpentine.
6. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with Claim 4 or Claim 5 in which the surface contacting element and the resilient section are formed unitarily.
7. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with Claim 4, Claim 5 or Claim 6 in whch the surface contacting surface and the resilient section of the first contact element are directly adjoined.
8. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with any preceding claim in which the contacting surface of the 


 second contact element is arranged at an angle of less than 90 degrees to the principal axis of the second contact _5 element.
9. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with any preceding claim in which the contacting surface of the second contact element is formed unitarily with the 0 remainder of the second contact element.
10. A two-part electrical connector in accordance with any preceding claim in which the contacting surface of the second contact element lies within a recess in the other 5 part.
