<ABSTRACT>
A powder for use in a thermal spraying coating process 
comprises particles consisting essentially of a metal 

carbide core coated at least partially with a layer 
consisting essentially of a nickel-chromium alloy 

containing the metal carbide dissolved therein. The 
particles are formed by heating a mixture of fine starting 

particles of the metal carbide in the presence of the 
nickel-chromium alloy under conditions effective to cause 

a portion, preferably 60 to 90 wt.%, of the starting metal 
carbide to dissolve in the Ni-Cr alloy. In an alternate 

embodiment suitable for higher temperature application, 
more than 90 wt. % of the starting carbide particles are 

dissolved. As the amount dissolved approaches 100 wt.%, the 
core essentially disappears. Coatings formed according to 

the invention show an unexpectedly large increase in both 
smoothness and erosion resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to a powder useful in thermal 
spraying of coatings, particularly for anti-corrosion 
coatings for metal parts. Chromium carbide coatings have been made by thermal 
spraying for many years. One such coating is made of Cr3C2 
particles in a nickel-chromium alloy binder. Other 
carbides have also been used with nickel-chromium. However, 
for certain types of high temperature applications, 
chromium carbide is the only practical choice. For example, 
carbide in a cobalt binder can be used as an anti-erosion 
coating for many aircraft part surfaces, but lacks 
sufficient heat resistance for use in high temperature 
zones. Tungsten carbide titanium carbide solid solution 
with a nickel binder is somewhat better, but still 
inadequate at high temperatures. During thermal spraying, the powder is heated, 
resulting in full or partial melting, and then sprayed onto 
the surface to be coated. The powder is generally a simple 
blend of chromium carbide powder with nickel chromium 
powder, most commonly a 75 wt. % chromium carbide/25 wt. 
% Ni-Cr mixture or 80 wt. % chromium carbide/20 wt. % Ni-Cr 
mixture, but blends ranging from 7 wt. % to 25 wt. % Ni-Cr 
are in common use. In general, during spraying the 
chromium carbide remains solid while the nickel-chromium 
alloy melts, resulting in a coating in which the carbide 
particles are embedded in nickel-chromium. If the carbide 
particles are relatively large, the resulting coating will 
have poor smoothness. The nickel-chromium alloy used in these blends has 
been an 80 wt. % nickel/20 wt. % chromium alloy (e.g., 
NICHROME). The mixture is most commonly applied by a 
non-transferred plasma arc process. With the advent of the 
high velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying process, however, a 
need for new chromium carbide coating materials became 
apparent because the HVOF process does not work well with  
 
known chromium carbide/Ni-Cr alloy powder blends. The HVOF 
process tends to segregate the blend into its components, 
forming an unsatisfactory coating. To overcome this problem, a prior art powder marketed 
by us pre-blends 80 wt.% chromium carbide particles with 20 
wt. % of the Ni-Cr (80:20) binder. The particles consists 
essentially of a chromium carbide core coated at least 
partially with a layer consisting essentially of a nickel-chromium 
alloy. Successive steps of sintering, grinding 
and classification are used to form the particles. Pre-blended 
particles prepared in this manner provided some 
improvement in performance, but the
