<ABSTRACT>
2.1. The invention serves to optimise the characteristic values of optoelectronic components based on DFB or DBR gratings. 2.2. According to the invention, there is located laterally centrally a grating region, on which border laterally two grating-free regions, the grating limitations being constructed, in particular in the vicinity of the intensity maximum of the guided light field, in the shape of continuously running curves. The lateral guiding of the waves is in this case supported to a considerable extent by the specific design of the grating regions and of the grating-free regions. 2.3. The solution according to the invention can be used in a particularly advantageous manner in optoelectronic components, such as lasers, laser amplifiers, filters, couplers and switches.
