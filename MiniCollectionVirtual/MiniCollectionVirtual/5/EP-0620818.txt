<DESCRIPTION>
 DESCRIPTIONAryl Ketones as testosterone 5* - reductase InhibitorsTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to novel heterocyclic compound. More particularly, it relates to novel heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof which has pharmacological activities such as inhibitory activity on testosteron 5α-reductase and the like, to a process for preparation thereof, to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same and to a use of the same as a medicament.Disclosure of the InventionAccordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide novel heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which is of use as a testosteron 5α-reductase inhibitor.Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparation of said heterocyclic compound or a salt thereof. A further object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as an active ingredient, said heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 

 Still further object of the present invention is to provide a use of said heterocyclic compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as a medicament such as testosteron 5α-reductase inhibitor useful for treating or preventing testosteron 5α-reductase-mediated diseases such as prostatomegaly, prostatism, alopecia, acnes, and the like in human being or animals.The heterocyclic compound of the present invention is novel and can be represented by the formula (I) :R-^A-CO-X-Y-R2 (I)in which R is carboxy(lower)alkyl or protected carboxy(lower)alkyl,2 R is optionally substituted aralkyl,X is optionally substituted arylene,
 wherein R6 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, optionally substituted aralkyl or amino-protective group, andA is a bivalent radical derived from imidazopyridine, azulene, thiophene, pyrrolo[2,3-bjpyridine, quinolone, indazole or dihydrobenzimidazole, each of which may be substituted by one or more suitable substituent(s) .According to the present invention, the object compound (I) and a salt thereof can be prepared by the following processes. 

Process 1R -A-CO-X-Y-H HO-R(ID (III) or a salt thereof or its reactive derivative at the hydroxy group, or a salt thereofR1-A-CO-X-Y-R2(I) or a salt thereofProcess 2Removal or the carboxy-protective group(I-a) or a salt thereof(l-b) or a salt thereofwherein R 1, R2, A, X and Y are each as defined above,R_. is protected carboxy(lower)alkyl, and R, 1 is carboxy(lower)alkyl.Suitable salts of the compound (I) are conventional
