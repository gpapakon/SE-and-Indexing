<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rotary closure for the releasable connection of components, having a closure pin which is supported, via a spring element, on one component, the pin shank projecting through mutually aligned shaped holes of the components and, at its free end, bearing locking protrusions which, when one component is placed against the other component, can be introduced into the shaped hole of the other component, can be guided axially through the shaped hole of the other component counter to the restoring force of the spring element and, by subsequent rotation of the closure pin, can be transferred into a locking position behind the other component. Between the pin head and the locking protrusions, the pin shank bears at least two further stop protrusions which, due to their position, configuration and dimensioning relative to the shaped holes of the two components, prevent rotation of the closure pin in the open rest position and in the definitive locking position, but permit the closure pin to rotate through a predetermined angle when the closure pin is pressed down fully counter to the restoring spring.

<CLAIMS>
Rotational fastener, in particular a quarterturn
fastener, for the releasable connection of, for

example, plate-shaped components (1, 2), like a cover
on a housing, having a fastener pin (3) which is

supported, for example by means of its pin head (4), by
way of a spring element (5) on the first component (1),

the pin shaft (6) of which fastener pin projects
through shaped holes (7, 8) of the components (1, 2),

which shaped holes are aligned with each other, and
which pin shaft at its free end supports interlocking

projections (9) which are preferably diametrically
opposed to each other and which can be introduced into

the shaped hole (8) of the second component (2) when
the first component (1) is placed against the second

component (2), can be guided axially through the shaped
hole (8) of the other component (2) against the

restoring force of the spring element (5) and, by means
of subsequent turning of the fastener pin (3), can be

transferred by an angle of, for example, 90° into an
interlocking position behind the other component (2),

characterized in that the pin shaft (6) at a distance
from the pin head (4) supports a first stop projection

(10) which, when the fastener pin (3) is pushed
completely against the restoring force of the spring

element (5), can be lifted out of an opening position
of rest out of a blocking slot (11) of the shaped hole

(7) of the first component (1), in that the pin shaft
(6) supports a second stop projection (12) beginning at

a smaller distance from the pin head (4), which stop
projection (12), when the fastener pin (3) is pushed

against the restoring force of the spring element (5)
out of the opening position of rest, remains in a

shaped recess (13) of the shaped hole (7) of the first
component (1), which shaped recess allows the

subsequent turning of the fastener pin (3) only in one 
direction by a specified angle of, for example, 90°

into an interlocking position, in that the shaped hole
(8) of the second component (2) has radial edge

recesses (14) for the passage of the interlocking
projections (9) and, moreover, has a smaller diameter

which, however, allows the turning of the fastener pin
(3) when it is pushed completely against the restoring

force of the spring element (5) despite the stop
projections (10, 12), and in that in the interlocking

position of the fastener pin (3), which position is
secured under the restoring force of the spring element

being allocated to the first stop projection.
