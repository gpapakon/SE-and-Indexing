<ABSTRACT>
A laparoscopic ligation clip applicator for 
automatically applying a plurality of ligation clips 

includes a handle assembly (10) having an actuator (14), an 
elongated shaft (12) connected to the handle assembly, and 

an actuating mechanism (15) disposed within the shaft. The 
actuating mechanism includes a clamp (26) for engaging a 

first piece (5) of the ligation clip and a slidable driver (28) 
for driving a second piece (7) of the ligation clip 

relative to the first piece. The actuating mechanism 
also includes a hold (30) for preventing rearward movement 

of the ligation clips, and an advancer (32) for sequentially 
feeding the ligation clips. A slidable cam (36), operably 

connected to the handle assembly, actuates the clamp, 
the driver and the advancer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a medical 
instrument for use with one or more surgical ligation 
clips. More particularly, the invention is directed to 
a laparoscopic ligation clip applicator for assembling 
and clamping a two-piece ligation clip and for 
automatically feeding each of a plurality of ligation 
clips to be sequentially assembled and clamped. There are many types of known mechanical applicators 
for automatically feeding and sequentially closing each 
of a plurality of conventional ligation clips around a 
vessel (e.g., a vein, an artery, a cystic duct, and the 
like.) to be occluded. A conventional ligation clip is 
typically made of metal and is U-shaped with two 
extending legs that are bent inwardly by, for example, 
a known fulcrum type applicator having a scissors-like 
handle with movable jaws. The jaws close together to 
crimp the clip about the vessel. Such known 
applicators house a plurality of ligation clips and 
automatically feed the clips by using, for example, a 
biasing mechanism, to sequentially position the 
ligation clips to be crimped between the movable jaws. 
Other known ligation clip appliers include movably 
mounted crimping jaws, and feeding mechanisms for 
conventional ligation clips, that are actuated remotely 
through various trigger mechanisms.  
 WO 91/08708 discloses inter alia an arrangement in accordance with the 
first part of claim 1, and a variety of configurations for suture tie 
devices and suture tie device applicators, as well as methods of 
suturing. The suture tie devices generally include at least one 
leg member having a curved or angled distal, tissue engaging 
portion. A tying member unidirectionally or bidirectionally 
displaceable along the leg member can optionally be provided. 
Engagement of a leg distal portion with a generally opposed leg 
distal portion or the tying member forms a suture loop which 
positions organ or tissue material between the curved or angled 
legs and the tying member. The tying member can be advanced 
toward the leg member so as to provide variable extent of suture 
tension.  
 However, further improvements for applying surgical 
ligation clips are desirable, and in particular, an 
automatic ligation clip applicator is needed for use 
with two-piece ligation clips. Those ligation 
clips provide many advantages over known metal clips 
since they provide superior clamping strength and may 
be made of bioabsorbable non-metallic materials. Accordingly, it is a general object of the present 
invention to

<CLAIMS>
A ligation clip applicator for applying 
each of a plurality of two-piece ligation clips (3), each 

said ligation clip including a clamp (5) and a clip body (7) 
movable relative to said clamp (5) to close it about a 

vessel; said clip applicator comprising: 

means (12) for storing a plurality of said ligation clips 
(3) in an array with a distalmost ligation clip (3) in an 

application position; 
means for releasably holding said clamp (5) of said 
distalmost ligation clip (3) at said application position; 
means (28) for moving said clip body (7) relative to said 
clamp (5), held at said application position, thereby to 

close said clamp (5); 
means for releasing said releasable holding means to free 
said now-closed distalmost ligation clip (3) from said 

application position; and 
means for advancing another ligation clip (3) from said 
array to said application position;
 
characterised by 
retaining springs (50) for preventing movement of the 
ligation clips (3) in a rearward direction and said 

advancing means including an advancer (32) slidable relative 
to the ligation clips (3) for sequentially advancing the 

ligation clips (3) in the forward direction and positioning 
a next-to-distal-most ligation clip (3) in the feed position 

in said storing means (12); and by  
 
a spring-loaded drive means (34) connected to said advancer 
(32) for automatically driving the advancer (32) forwards 

towards the distal end of the applicator at the end of the 
cam-return stroke, and a slidable cam (36) for actuating 

said clip body moving means (28) and said advancer (32), 
said cam being operably engaged by said drive means (34) and 

moving it in the rearward direction during a cam-return 
stroke to charge said spring-loaded drive means (34), 

wherein said drive means (34) disengages from said cam near 
the end of the cam-return stroke and discharges forwardly to 

drive said advancer in the forward direction to engage and 
advance the ligation clips (3). 
A ligation clip applicator according to Claim 1, further 
comprising a cam spring connected to said cam and supported 

in said storing means, wherein said cam spring is charged 
during a cam-forward stroke and discharges to initiate the 

cam-return stroke and retract said cam in a rearward 
direction. 
A ligation clip applicator according to Claim 1, wherein 
said advancer comprises a plurality of springs which are 

flexed by the ligation clips when said advancer slides in 
the rearward direction and which engage and advance the 

ligation clips when said advancer is moved in the forward 
direction. 
A ligation clip applicator according to Claim 1, wherein 
said drive means (34) includes an elongated shaft and a 

compression spring disposed around said shaft. 
A ligation clip applicator according to Claim 1, wherein 
said drive means (34) comprises a drive head, an elongated 

shaft connected to said drive head, and a compressing spring 
mounted on said elongated shaft, said compression spring  

 
being compressed by movement of said drive head in the 

rearward direction. 
A ligation clip applicator according to claim 5, said drive 
head having a flexible latch engageable with a drive slot in 

said cam, wherein said flexible latch engages said drive 
slot in the cam-return stroke and said drive means (34) is 

advanced in the rearward direction to compress said drive 
spring, said latch disengages from said drive slot near the 

end of the cam-return stroke and said drive spring

the forward direction whereupon said advancer engages the 
array of ligation clips and moves them in the forward 

direction. 
A ligation clip applicator according to Claim 1, wherein 
said releasable holding means includes clamping means for 

holding stationary the clamp of the distalmost ligation 
clip, and said moving means includes a slidable driver for
