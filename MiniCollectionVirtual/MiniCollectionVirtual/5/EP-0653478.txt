<ABSTRACT>
The disposal of waste materials in an environmentally acceptable manner is a great problem needing to be solved with increasing urgency. A known treatment is thermal utilisation, in which the waste materials are burned (incinerated) or else first subjected to low-temperature pyrolysis and the resulting low-temperature pyrolysis products are then at least partially burned. Starting from these known processes, it is proposed according to the invention to carry out the low-temperature pyrolysis in a rotary tubular furnace which contains an immersion bed of prepared low-temperature pyrolysis residues into which bed the waste materials are immersed, which enables direct heating of the rotary tubular furnace. The low-temperature pyrolysis residues obtained in the low-temperature pyrolysis, after mechanical treatment, are then converted into a synthesis gas.

Process for the thermal utilization of waste materials originating from different
collections, such as household and industrial refuse, used tires, plastic waste, sludges

like sewage sludge or the like, where the waste materials are subjected to low-temperature
carbonization a rotary kiln during a first thermal stage and the products

obtained by low-temperature carbonization are at least in part subjected to further
thermal treatment, 
characterized in that
a) low-temperature carbonization is carried out in a directly heated rotary kiln
(13) which is operated by the co-current principle and which includes a

material layer made up of recycled, fine-grained residues (34) from low-temperature
carbonization;
b) the gas (40) obtained from low-temperature carbonization is transferred
to a thermal secondary-combustion device (26);
c) the residues (41) from low-temperature carbonization are directed to
mechanical processing and - after separation of a portion (34) for forming the

material layer in the rotary kiln (13) - are converted to synthesis gas (42) in a
gasification cyclone (22) by the addition of pure oxygen.

characterized in that
 the combustion
gases produced during combustion of the gases from low-temperature carbonization

(40) are directed to a steam generating device (27).

characterized in that
 the combustion
gases produced during combustion of the gases from low-temperature carbonization

(40) are routed to an air preheater (28).

characterized in that
 portions of
the synthesis gas (37) produced are used for heating the rotary kiln (13) and the

secondary-combustion device (26).

characterized in that
 the
temperature of the rotary kiln (13) ranges between 300 and 1 200°C, preferably

between 450 and 600°C.
Process in accordance with claims 1), 2), 3), 4) or 5) 
characterized in that
 the residues
from gasification of the remains from low-temperature carbonization are discharged

from the gasification cyclone in liquid form.

characterized in that

that following plant components are connected with each other:

a) at least one primary comminution device (12) for size reduction of coarse
refuse;
b) a directly heated co-current rotary kiln (13) with a material layer made
up of fine-grained, processed residues from low-temperature carbonization;
