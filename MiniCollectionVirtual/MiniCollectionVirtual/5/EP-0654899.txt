<ABSTRACT>
The method consists:   -in automatically determining (9) a datum gain value as a function of the operating conditions of the amplifier (3) -in measuring (12) the discrepancy existing between the amplitude of the signal applied to the input of the amplifier (3) and that of a signal obtained by dividing the amplitude of the signal supplied at the output of the amplifier (3) by the datum gain value -and in minimising the discrepancy existing, by weighting the amplitude of the signal applied to the input of the amplifier (14, 2) in the direction which makes it possible to reduce the discrepancy.   Application: HF radio transmitter-receiver.

consists:

in automatically determining (9) a target gain
value on the basis of the operating conditions of the

amplifier (3)

of the amplifier (3) and that of a signal obtained by
dividing the amplitude of the signal delivered at the

output of the amplifier (3) by the target gain value
