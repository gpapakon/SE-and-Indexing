<ABSTRACT>
Two guide rods (19,20) are connected together at a common connecting point and with their two other ends (15,16) are fixed for articulated movement to the first and second front attachments (A,B). One end of the piston cylinder drive (5) is fixed for articulated movement to the first attachment. The other end of the piston cylinder drive (5) engages on the common articulated connecting point of the guide rods. The two attachments are coupled directly together by one swivel bearing. The displaceable attachment can be brought into its travelling position by swivelling the swivel attachment.

<CLAIMS>
Agricultural machine having a first (A) and a second (B) 
front attachment, which front attachments are supported 

such that they can be moved transversely to the longitudinal 
axis of the machine and are interconnected by a 

swivel axle (2) pointing in the direction of travel of 
the machine, the first front attachment (A) being mounted 

on a base frame (3), supported by the machine, such that 
it is displaceable transversely to the longitudinal axis 

of the machine and the second front attachment (B) being 
pivotable and able to be placed above the first front 

attachment (A), having a distance control arm (4), which 
is connected articulately by its one end, via a fixed 

bearing (5), to the machine and is connected articulately 
by its other end to the second front attachment (B), and 

having a single piston/cylinder drive (5) for transferring 
the front attachments (A, B) from their working 

position into the transporting position and vice versa, 
the one end of the said piston/cylinder drive being 

fastened articulately to the first front attachment (A), 
characterized in that two control arms (19, 20) are 

interconnected at a common hinge point and are fastened 
articulately by their other two ends (15, 16), in the 

region of the dividing point, to the first and second 
front attachment (A, B) respectively, and in that the 

other end of the piston/cylinder drive (5) acts upon the 
common hinge point of the control arms (19, 20).
