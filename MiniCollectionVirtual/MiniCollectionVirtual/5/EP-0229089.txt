<ABSTRACT>
An additive for liquid fuel, such as fuel oil, gas oil and Diesel oil comprising manganese salts of aliphatic acids, high-boiling tar oil and naphthalene as compulsory ingredients and if necessary furthermore one or several of the ingredients, iron naphthenate, ferric chloride and calcium salts of aliphatic acids. The additive improves the combustion and consequently the efficiency, reduces accumulation and deposit of impurities in the combustion system, reduces environmental contaminating discharges and diminishes corrosion damages caused by acid ingredients, such as sulphuric acid.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: An Additive for Liquid FuelTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to an additive for liquid fuel, such as fuel oil, gas oil and Diesel oil, including motor Diesel .Background ArtFor many years attempts have been made to find suitable agents which by addition to liquid fuels improve the com¬ bustion, reduce corrosion damages and diminish the accu- mulation of impurities in the system.Furthermore, considerable amounts of additive for liquid fuels have been sold and used for many years, but unfor- tuantely the effects obtained have not been satisfactory. A certain soot and oil coke reducing effect has, however, been obtained by means of certain metals.In order to reduce the formation of sulphuric acid and consequently the corrosion it is advantageous to work with a very small excess of air. An additional reason for aiming at combustion of oils at a very low excess of air is the resulting considerable improvement of the efficiency. Unfortunately, a low excess of air results in formation of soot and oil coke in large amounts.Disclosure of the InventionIt is the object of the present invention to provide a new additive, which is better than the previously known ad¬ ditives, and which, with economical profits for the user, improves the combustion and consequently the efficiency, reduces accumulation and deposit of impurities in the com¬ bustion system, reduces environmental contaminating dis- 

charges and reduces corrosion damages caused by acid in¬ gredients, such as sulphuric acid.This object is obtained by means of an additive for liquid fuel according to the invention and characterised by con- taining1) manganese salts of aliphatic acids,2) high-boiling tar oil, and3) naphthaleneand if desired one or several of the following additional ingredients4) iron naphthenate,5) ferric chloride and6) calcium salts of aliphatic acids.As examples of applicable manganese salts may be mentioned manganese salts of branched aliphatic acids with 8-9 carbon atoms, such as Manganese SiccatoϊS' from Akzo Chemie, con¬ taining about 10% Mn, 61-67% of a non-volatile material as well as 35% of mineral spirits (white spirits) or "NuodexS' Dryer Manganese".t,-Tuode»S' Dryer Iron" may be mentioned as an example of a suitable iron napththenate preparation.Examples of suitable qualities of high-boiling tar oil may be those containing polyaromatic hydrocarbons, such as anthracene oil. By heating anthracene oil 40% are distilled in the temperature range 330-400°C. The flash point of an¬ thracene oil is 180° in a closed
