<ABSTRACT>
A method for fabricating an integrated circuit 
transistor begins with forming a gate electrode over an 

insulating layer grown on a conductive layer. Sidewall 
spacers are formed alongside vertical edges of the gate 

electrode and a mask is applied to a drain region. A 
relatively fast-diffusing dopant is then implanted into a 

source region in the conductive layer. Thereafter, the 
mask is removed and the drain region is implanted with a 

relatively slow-diffusing dopant. Finally, the conductive 
layer is annealed, causing the relatively fast-diffusing 

dopant to diffuse beneath the source sidewall spacer to a 
location approximately beneath the vertical edge of the 

source side of the gate electrode, and causing the 
relatively slow-diffusing dopant to extend beneath the 

drain sidewall spacer a lesser distance, so that the drain 
junction is laterally spaced from underneath the gate 

electrode. Due to the difference in diffusion rates 
between the relatively slow-diffusing dopant and the 

relatively fast-diffusing dopant, a transistor having a 
drain junction offset is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related generally to 
integrated circuits, and more specifically to a new device 
structure and process for preparing field effect 
transistors (FETs) having a drain junction offset. Within microelectronic integrated circuits, 
transistors are used to perform many different functions. 
For example, within static random access memory (SRAM) 
devices, transistors are used to form memory cells to store 
bits of data. Within such memory cells, some transistors 
are used to actively pull-up the output of the memory cell. The electrical characteristics of such an active pull-up 
transistor are important to the design and fabrication 
of multimegabit memory devices. One characteristic 
important in the design of such active pull-up transistors 
is the subthreshold leakage, or "off" current, which passes 
through the transistor when the transistor is biased in an 
"off" state. Transistors having a low subthreshold leakage 
current are desirable because they reduce power consumed 
while the memory device is in the standby mode. In the design and manufacture of thin film transistors 
(TFTs), a drain junction offset is desirable to reduce such 
subthreshold leakage current. A drain junction offset 
exist when the drain junction is not located beneath the 
gate electrode, but instead is located a selected distance 
away from a point beneath the edge of the gate electrode. In contrast, a source offset is not desirable because 
a source offset will reduce the transistor's on current.  Although self-aligned techniques to produce drain 
junction offset are known, they require excessive photo and 
etch steps to build a drain offset without a source offset. Therefore, according to the present invention, a 
method for fabricating an integrated circuit transistor 
begins with forming a gate electrode over an insulating 
layer grown on a conductive layer. Sidewall spacers are 
formed alongside vertical edges of the gate electrode and 
a mask is applied to a drain region. A relatively fast-diffusing 
dopant is then implanted into a source region in 
the conductive layer. Thereafter, the mask is removed and 
the drain region is implanted with a relatively slow-diffusing 
dopant. Finally, the conductive layer is 
annealed, causing the relatively fast-diffusing dopant to 
diffuse beneath the source sidewall spacer to a location 
approximately beneath the vertical edge of the source side 
of the gate electrode, and causing the relatively slow-diffusing 
dopant to extend beneath the drain sidewall 
spacer
