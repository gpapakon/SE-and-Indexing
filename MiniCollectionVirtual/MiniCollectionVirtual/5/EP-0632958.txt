<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with an insect-proofing composition and
an insect-proofing method. More specifically, the present invention is concerned
with an insect-proofing composition comprising N'-alkyl-N'-(3,5-dimethylbenzoyl)-N-(substituted
benzoyl)-hydrazine as an active ingredient, and an insect-proofing
method using such compound. The composition and method have particular
application in treating wool.Several hundred million kilos of wool are treated with mothproofing agents
every year. Much of this goes into carpets, apparel, bed wear and upholstery. The
key pests are various species of clothing moths. The mothproofing, wool-treating
agent(s) can be applied during fibre manufacture, usually during the dyeing process.Several characteristics are desired in a wool-treating agent. For example, the
agent must be efficacious against the pests which can damage wool. Typical wool
pests which feed on the keratin in wool are Lepidoptera larvae, e.g. Tineola species
and Tinea species, and Coleoptera larvae, e.g. Anthrenus species and Attagenus
species. The agents used should be stable to hydrolysis, washfast, and lightfast for
protecting wool in the processed state. The treated wool has use in woolen textiles
such as blankets, wool carpets, woolen underwear, woolen clothing, knits and
blends with other natural materials or with artificial fibres.Other beneficial properties of wool-treating agents include low volatility and
dry-cleaning fastness. Yet another important property is chemical loading onto the
wool, which can be environmentally beneficial by reducing the amount of treatment
agent which passes through to waste streams. One measure of loading
characteristics is the log P value of the compound, which log P denotes the relative
lipophilic value as calculated by C. Hanach et al., in J. Med. Chem. 16, 1207 (1973).
Chemical stability during chemical loading is important since the loading may be
performed under dyeing conditions (e.g. a pH range to 2 to 7, temperatures of 100°C, 
dyeing time of one to five hours). Efficacy must be retained after subjection of these
harsh conditions as well as in the presence of down-process lubricants, surfactants
and other additives. A major wool-treating agent heretofore has been pyrethroids,
such as permethrin. Permethrin use, however, has become problematic in its
contamination of the aquatic environments which are the recipients of the wool-treatment
waste streams.US-A-4,985,461 and US-A-5,117,057 disclose insecticidal N'-substituted-N,N'-diacylhydrazines

claim. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, wherein said treating is performed in a dye
or wash bath in the temperature range from 10° to 100° C.
A process as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7, wherein the keratin digesting
insect is a Lepidoptera larva.
A process for treating keratinous material, which comprises the step of
treating said keratinous material in a cleaning process, utilizing a cleaning agent,

with a composition as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, and wherein the composition
is prepared by dissolving the hydrazine(s) in the cleaning agent.
A process as claimed in any of claims 6 to 9, wherein the keratinous material
is wool.
