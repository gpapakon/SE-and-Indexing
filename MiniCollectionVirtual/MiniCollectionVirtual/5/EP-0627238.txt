<ABSTRACT>
A pace generating device which outputs a desirable pace signal automatically 
without stopping an exerciser from exercising and which can save consumption power. 
Walking detect means 103 detects walking and outputs a detected walking signal. 
The walking pace calculating means 104 calculates a pace from the period of the detect 

walking signal and stores it in the walking pace storing means 105. A pace comparing 
means 106 compares a predetermined pace with the detect walking pace, and outputs a 

pace generating indicate signal when the result of the above comparison between the detect 
walking pace and the predetermined pace is out of a predetermined range. The pace signal 

generating means 109 receives the pace generating indicate signal, makes a pace signal 
corresponding to the predetermined pace, and outputs the pace signal to a pace outputting 

means 110 so as to output a pace.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pace generating device for generating pace
signals with predetermined periodicity.Exercise walking, such as jogging, has been popular recently with the public for
the purpose of improving their health. A pace generating device which has been put to
practical use in order to assist exercise is shown in Fig. 12. The device generates pace
sounds with predetermined periodicity. In a conventional pace generating device shown
in Fig. 12, a user inputs a desirable pace thereto by pace data inputting means 108 whilst
looking at display means 102. This inputted pace data is transformed into a pace signal
by a standard clock signal of timing signal generating means 101. Next, an inputting
means 100 starts the pace outputting, and a pace is outputted by pace outputting means
103 using electronic sounds in accordance with which a user takes exercise.However, such a conventional pace generating device has a problem in that a user
must stop exercising and then operate the inputting means in order to hear the pace
sounds to change or check the required pace.When the pace sounds are outputted, the pace sounds keeps on being outputted
until a user stops exercise and again operates the inputting means. This increases
consumption power and makes it difficult to drive the device by an electric battery,
which is another problem of a conventional pace generating device.A known pace generating device is disclosed in British Patent Publication No.
2121219 in which a shoe is described which measures the user's pace and compares this
with a preset pace value. If the measured pace is equal to or greater than the preset
pace, a first sound sequence is emitted, while if the measured pace is less than the preset
pace, a second sound sequence is emitted. The beat frequency at which the sound
sequences are emitted is adjusted based on the measured pace value. A further known pace generating device is described in US Patent No. 5164967
which compares the frequency of steps with a preset frequency and emits a sound signal
at the preset frequency to guide the user. The device counts a preset number of paces
and then visually displays to the user the number of these paces which were made within
the predetermined frequency.Another known pace generating device is described in Japanese Patent Publication
No. JP 55-134387 which describes a watch which counts the number of steps over a
preset time and compares this to a preset number. A sound is then generated indicating
to the user whether the number of
