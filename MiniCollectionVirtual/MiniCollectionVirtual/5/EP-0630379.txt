<DESCRIPTION>
£ CYCLIC KETAL DERIVATIVESThis invention relates to novel compounds having hypocholesterolemic, 5 hypolipidemic and/or antifungal activity, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medicine, particularly in the treatment and/or prevention of atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular diseases. The invention also relates to novel compounds which are useful as intermediates for the preparation of compounds having 10 hypocholesterolemic, hypolipidemic and/or antifungal activity.High levels of blood cholesterol and blood lipids are conditions which are implicated in the onset of vessel wall disease. Methods for effective reduction of plasma cholesterol levels are therefore of high interest. Cholesterol concentrations can be reduced, for example, by lowering the dietary intake of 15 the sterol, by enhancing its metabolism and elimination or by decreasing its rate of biosynthesis. The most effective approaches to lowering physiological cholesterol level are likely to include inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis as a component since cholesterol synthesis is subject to feedback regulation, so that decreases in cholesterol levels tend to be compensated for by increased 20 biosynthesis.One rate-controlling step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol is the formation of mevalonic acid from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) and clinical successes have been achieved with the mevinic acid family of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Mevalonic acid,25 however, is a common precursor of all isoprenyl derivatives, including in animals coenzyme Q, heme A and the dolichols.The first biosynthetic step which leads exclusively to sterois, the* condensation of two famesyl diphosphates to give squalene, is a second site of regulation. The synthesis of squalene from famesyl diphosphate involves an30 isolable intermediate, presqualene diphosphate, and the entire synthetic 

sequence is catalysed by squalene synthase (farnesyldiphosphate: farnesyldiphosphate farnesyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.21), a membrane-bound enzyme. Agents which act to inhibit the enzyme squalene synthase are therefore potential drugs for the regulation of cholesterogenesis. The use of such agents is attractive as non-steroidal pathways should be minimally affected.The biosynthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol component of fungal cell membranes, is analogous to that of cholesterol in mammals, including humans, and is thus mediated by the enzyme
