Method for vitrifying residues containing larger 
amounts of carbon in an electrically heated glass 

melting furnace (2) wherein the exhaust gas from the 
glass melting furnace is afterburnt for the transition 

of CO to CO
2
,
characterized in
 
that the exhaust gas from the afterburning for heating 

the glass batch parts is fed to a glass batch 
preheater (4) comprising chambers (13) serving as 

guiding members for the bulk material with the chambers 
extending obliquely from outside the top to inside 

the bottom, and streamed through by air, that 
the exhaust gas in the preheater is cooled by cold 

air, that the air heated in the glass batch preheater 
(4) streams out at a temperature between 150°C 

and 400°C, preferably about 200°C, and is fed to the 
afterburning in a partial stream, and that thereafter 

the exhaust gas is fed to a gas washer and a 
final purifying. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that 
a further partial air stream drawn out of the glass 

batch preheater (4) is fed to a heat exchanger (9) 
wherein the partial air stream heats the exhaust gas 

to a temperature suitable for the cleaning in an 
activated carbon filter (10, 11).  

 
Method according to one of the claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a third partial hot air stream is 

fed into the sludge of a gas waher (7) and thickens 
the sludge such that it may be fed to the glass melting 

furnace (2). 
Method according to one of the preceeding claims, 
characterized in that lumpy unhydrated lime is fed 

to the glass batch in the glass batch preheater (4) 
to adsorb chlorine and sulfur. 
Apparatus for accomplishing the method according to 
one of the preceeding claims with an electrically 

heated glass melting furnace (2), and an afterburning 
chamber (3), characterized in that the apparatus 

comprises a gas washer (7), at least one activated 
carbon filter (10, 11), and a glass batch preheater 

(4) comprising chambers (13) serving as guiding 
members for the bulk material with the chambers 

extending obliquely from outside the top to inside 
the bottom, and streamed through by air.
