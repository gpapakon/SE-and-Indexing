<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antifouling agent
which aims at preventing damages due to the adhesion
and propagation of aquatic pests in sea water or
industrial water systems. More particularly, it
relates to an antifouling agent which is to be used
for protecting submerged structures such as ships,
fishing nets, buoys or sea water induction pipes from
the adhesion of aquatic pests to the surface thereof.Submerged structures, for example, ships, port
facilities, buoys, pipe lines, bridges, excavators for
seabed oil fields, water pipes in electric power
plants or seaside plants, fish nets or fish breeding
rafts suffer from the adhesion of large-sized animals
and plants such as barnacle, hard-shelled mussel and
laver and small-sized ones such as diatom and
bacteria, which causes various damages, for example,
corrosion of the structures, an increase in sea water
friction of ships, death of a number of fishes due to
fishing net jamming, settling out due to gain in
weight and a decrease in operating efficiency.
Further, in industrial water systems with the use of 
natural water such as river water and lake water as,
for example, cooling water or in circulating cooling
systems with the use of moderately or highly purified
city water, the abnormal propagation of, for example,
bacteria, diatom, blue-green algae and spirogyra
causes various troubles including deterioration of
water qualities, a decrease in cooling efficiency and
pipe jamming due to the adhesion thereof to the walls
of instruments and reduction in flow rate.In order to prevent these troubles caused by
aquatic pests, there have been employed antifouling
agents containing inorganic heavy metal compounds such
as copper suboxide, copper rhodanide and mercury oxide
or organic metal compounds such as tributyltin oxide,
triphenyltin oxide and tributyltin (meth)acrylate
polymers.However, these compounds which have been
conventionally employed for the above-mentioned
purpose are not only highly toxic ones and thus should
be handled with religious care but also result in some
problems including deformation of fishes due to the
accumulation thereof in fish bodies and environmental
pollution. Therefore it has been urgently required to
use an antifouling agent free from any heavy metals or
organic metals. As such an antifouling agent free from any heavy
metals or organic metals, Japanese Patent Laid-Open
No. 128302/1991 has proposed the use of alkylphenols.
However, these alkyl-phenols are not usable in
practice at present, since the effects thereof are
lost
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
The use of one or more compounds according to the following
general formula (I) as an antifouling agent for suppressing

the adhesion of aquatic pests or marine pests:


(wherein R
1
, R
2
 and R
3
 independently represent each a
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or an alkyl group

carrying 1 to 30 carbon atoms; X represents an
inorganic oxygen acid residue; n is from 1 to 4; m is

from 0 to 3; and R
4
 represents a hydrogen atom or an
alkyl or alkenyl group carrying 1 to 30 carbon atoms

and optionally having an ether bond.)

formula (I) is a tris(alkylphenyl) phosphate.
The use as claimed in Claim 6
wherein said alkyl group is one carrying 3 to 12

carbon atoms.
The use as claimed in Claim 6
wherein said compound represented by the general

formula (I) is tris(nonylphenyl) phosphate.
