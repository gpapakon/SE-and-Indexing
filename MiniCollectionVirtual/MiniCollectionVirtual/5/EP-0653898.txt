<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for manufacturing an electrical heating element in which the metallic heating conductors are embedded between ceramic insulation layers, where, as power supply leads and power supply outlets, contact recesses in the ceramic insulation layers are filled with an electrically conductive composition. The heating conductors, the power supply leads and the power outlet leads are, according to the invention, applied to the ceramic layers in the green state as a metallising paste containing from 60 to 95% by weight of metal particles and from 5 to 40% by weight of inorganic powder, based on the total solids content of the paste. The ceramic layers together with the applied metallising pastes are then stacked on top of one another and then sintered.
