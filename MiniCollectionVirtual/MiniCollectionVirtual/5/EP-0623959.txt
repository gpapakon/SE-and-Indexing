<ABSTRACT>
An EEPROM cell has a first MOS transistor formed in a semiconductor 
substrate 1 of a first conductivity type and having current conducting 

regions 2a, 2b of a second conductivity type and a gate electrode 3, a 
well 4 of a second conductivity type provided in the substrate, a plate 

electrode 7 formed on the well with an insulating layer interposed 
therebetween, and at least one region 5 of the first conductivity type 

formed in the well adjacent to the plate electrode. The gate electrode 
and the plate electrode are connected in common and act as a floating 

gate 8. The well acts as a control gate. The EEPROM cell can be 
manufactured with ease by the standard CMOS process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrically erasable and 
programmable read only memory (EEPROM) cell, such as may be produced 
using CMOS technology and incorporated into a CMOS logic LSI chip. Non-volatile random access memories (RAM's) are used in various 
systems. For example, they are used as a system configuration data 
memory in a personal computer, a data register for suspend/resume 
function, a program memory for error checking, and a data memory for an 
IC card. The memory capacity required for such non-volatile memories is 
not very large and may often be sufficient in the range from several 
kilobits to several hundred kilobits. When such a non-volatile RAM of a small capacity and a logic LSI 
such as a gate array or a microprocessor can be formed together in the 
same semiconductor substrate, production costs and the size of the device 
can be greatly reduced. However, due to the difference between the 
respective production processes, it is difficult to form them in a mixed 
manner together in the same semiconductor substrate. For example, a 
typical non-volatile RAM is an EEPROM memory of stacked gate structure in 
which a floating gate and a control gate are stacked, but such a memory 
cannot be manufactured through the standard complementary metal oxide 
semiconductor (CMOS) logic LSI process. That is because the standard 
CMOS process employs a one-layer polysilicon deposition step whereas the 
ordinary stacked gate RAM's require two polysilicon deposition steps for 
the floating gate and control gate. The ordinary stacked gate RAM's 
further require a step of depositing a very thin oxide layer between the 
two gates that is not used in the standard CMOS process. Consequently, it is conventional in the prior art to form the 
non-volatile RAM and logic LSI in separate chips which are subsequently 
combined, or to modify the standard logic LSI process to allow the 
non-volatile RAM and logic LSI to be formed on the same chip. However, 
these methods are costly. Modifying the standard process also has a 
drawback in that it not only complicates the process but also requires 
strict process control.  Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application (PUPA) 3-101168 
discloses a non-volatile memory with a low power consumption formed 
through the CMOS process. In this patent application, between a program 
bit line and a ground potential are connected in series a first PMOS 
transistor, a second PMOS transistor, and an NMOS transistor. A floating 
gate is formed by the gates of the
