<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solution of 
one or more of a) a curing agent for an epoxy resin, b) 
a curing catalyst and c) a cure inhibitor in a solvent 
system and to an epoxy resin composition comprising this 
solution and an epoxy resin. It is a well known technique to utilize an 
organic solvent for reducing the viscosity of liquid 
epoxy resins or liquid curing agents therefor or to 
solubilize solid resins and/or curing agents in organic 
solvents in order to facilitate the handling of the 
epoxy resins and/or of the curing agents. U.S. patent 3,679,465 teaches the production of 
reinforced, hardenable epoxy compositions by 
continuously passing a reinforcement material through an 
epoxy solution system, thereby impregnating the 
reinforcement material with the epoxy solution system. 
The impregnated reinforcement material is subjected to a 
heat treatment. The epoxy solution system contains a 
curable epoxy resin, a curing agent therefor and a low 
boiling solvent. Various types of conventional curing 
agents or hardeners as well as accelerators are listed, 
such as primary and secondary amines, amides, 
polyamines, polyamides, dicyandiamide, benzoguanamine,  
 
imidazole, tetramethyl diamine, etc. As useful low 
boiling organic solvents are mentioned acetone or methyl 
ethyl ketone, or a mixture of dimethyl formamide, 
acetone and water. EP-A-0,472,830 discloses a dicyandiamide 
crosslinked epoxy prepreg which is produced in such a 
manner that it is substantially free from dicyandiamide 
crystals. Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and methyl 
ethyl ketone are named as preferred solvents for the 
epoxy material and dicyandiamide. It is known that mixtures containing an epoxy 
resin and certain curing agents therefor, such as 
dicyandiamide, have excellent storage stability at 20°C. 
Therefore, these mixtures are useful for producing so-called 
"one-component systems" which cure upon heating. East German patent 134 446 teaches that a major 
disadvantage of known one-component systems is the low 
solubility of dicyandiamide in the solvents which are 
used in these systems. The amount of dicyandiamide 
required for curing the system is often close to or even 
above its saturation concentration in the solvent. 
Precipitation of dicyandiamide from the one-component 
system at low temperature, such as 0°C, is quite 
frequent. In order to overcome this disadvantage, the 
East German patent suggests the production of a one-component 
system by dissolving an epoxy resin and 
dicyandiamide in a
