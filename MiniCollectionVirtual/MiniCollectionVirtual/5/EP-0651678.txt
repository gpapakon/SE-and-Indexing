<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to the field of trigger
dispensers, also known as trigger sprayers. The invention
is particularly directed to a trigger sprayer having
structure for foaming a dispensed liquid and to the incorporation
of a device integral with the sprayer nozzle
assembly for sealing the nozzle orifice of a foamer trigger
sprayer.There are numerous patents that have issued on
trigger dispensers of the general type to which this
invention relates. The patents discussed below exemplify
such trigger dispensers. Generally, a trigger dispenser
of the type involved here is a relatively low-cost pump
device which is held in the hand and which has a trigger
operable by squeezing or pulling the fingers of the hand
to pump liquid from a container and through a nozzle at
the front of the dispenser.Such trigger dispensers may have a variety of features
that have become common and well-known in the industry.
For example, the dispenser may be a dedicated 
sprayer that produces a defined spray pattern for the
liquid as it is dispensed from the nozzle. It is also
known to provide adjustable spray patterns such that with
a single dispenser the user may select any one of several
stream patterns from a stream to a fine mist. Some known
trigger dispensers also include a way to seal the dispenser
to prevent liquid from leaking from the nozzle orifice
during shipment or non-use. A variety of sealing
arrangements are known as will be more fully explained.It is also well-known to provide trigger dispensers
with a means to produce foaming of the liquid as it
is dispensed from the nozzle orifice. Such trigger dispensers
are generally referred to in the industry as
"foamers". Typically, the foam is produced by providing
a structure forward of the nozzle orifice upon which the
liquid from the orifice impinges to produce turbulence,
and thus foaming of the liquid and/or the added structure
has openings for admitting air for entrapment by the
liquid to cause the foaming. Various types of foamers
are known as will be more fully described below.Also, it is well known to provide foamers with a
means for sealing the orifice to prevent leakage of the
fluid from the dispenser during shipment or non-use.
Examples of known foamers with sealing means are described
below. As will be more fully described, the present
invention is specifically directed to a trigger
dispenser of the foamer type and with a simpler and less
expensive means for sealing the dispenser from leakage
during shipment or non-use.U.S. Patent 4,350,298 discloses a

<CLAIMS>
A trigger sprayer (20) having a housing (22),

a fluid passage through the housing communicating
with a source of liquid,
a nozzle orifice (34) through a wall (32) of the housing
communicating with the fluid passage,
a tube (37) supported by the wall and having one end (38)
communicating with the nozzle orifice,
the tube projecting from the nozzle orifice and
having an open free end (40) spaced from the nozzle orifice,
a door (54),
a pin (48) supported by and projecting perpendicularly
from the door and having a free end (52) adapted for closing

the nozzle orifice,
the pin being at least as long as the distance of
the tube free end from the nozzle orifice measured along

the longitudinal axis of the tube,
hinge means (56) or connecting the door to the housing
for swinging movement of the door between a non-obstructing

position at which the door and pin are substantially
out of the path of liquid flowing from the tube and a

sealing position at which the free end of the pin engages
the nozzle orifice,
the axis (E) of the hinge means being generally in the
plane (A) of the free end of the tube and being spaced from

the tube a sufficient distance to enable the pin to clear
the free end of the tube when the door is swung toward

the tube and to locate the free end of the pin in fluid
sealing position against the nozzle orifice when the door

is adjacent the free end of the tube.
The trigger sprayer Claim 1 wherein: the
distance between the hinge means (56) and a point (C) spaced below

the center-line of the nozzle orifice by an amount equal
to the radius of the pin (48) is substantially equal to the 

distance between the hinge means (56) and the portion (62) of the
inner wall of the tube furthest from the hinge means.
The trigger sprayer of Claim 1 wherein a transverse
plane (B) between a point (C) spaced below the center-line

of the nozzle orifice (34) an amount equal to the radius of
the pin (48) and the portion of the inner wall (44) of the tube

furthest from the hinge means (56) defines with the plane (A) of
the tube end an angle (a) substantially equal to the angle (b)

defined by said transverse plane (B) and a line (D) between said
point (C) and the hinge means.
The trigger sprayer of Claim 1 including:

the length of the pin (48) is slightly greater than the
distance from the nozzle orifice (34) to the free end (40) of the

tube,
and means (68, 70) for releasably locking the door (54) in a
position that presses the free end of the pin against the

nozzle.
The trigger sprayer of Claim 4 wherein:

the locking means includes keeper means (68) and resilient
latch means (70) on the outside wall of the tube and

the other on the door.
The trigger sprayer of Claim 4 wherein:

the door (54) incorporates relief areas (78) to allow flexing
for accommodation of manufacturing tolerances affecting

the length of the pin when the door is in the sealing
position.
The trigger sprayer of Claim 1 wherein:

the free end (52) the pin is spherical to fit past
the free end of the tube when the door is swung and for

partially entering the nozzle orifice (34, 36) in the sealing
position.
The trigger sprayer of Claim 7 wherein:

the diameter of the spherical end (52) is greater than
the diameter of the orifice (34).
The trigger sprayer of Claim 1 wherein:

the free end (52) of the pin has a convex projecting
surface whereby the convex projecting surface clears the

inner wall of the tube during swinging movement of the
door and the convex projecting surface can enter the

nozzle orifice (34).
The trigger sprayer of Claim 1 wherein:
