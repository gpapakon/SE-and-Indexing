<ABSTRACT>
A calendar clock generates a local calendar and 
date information of the self station to easily obtain 

local date information of a communication partner. The 
calendar includes individual information such as 

holidays, public holidays, and summer time. A time 
difference conversion circuit converts the date 

information sent from the communication partner into 
local date information of the self station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a communication
terminal apparatus and a communication conference
system, which allow easy schedule adjustment between
communication terminal apparatuses.Digital communication lines have been popular
recently, and a great deal of attention has been given
to a TV telephone/conference system using a digital
line network. Standardization is a prerequisite for
the popularization of a communication system. There
are five recommendations as to video and voice
communications, namely recommendation H. 221 specifying
the frame structure of 64 kbit/s to 1,920 kbit/s
channels; recommendation H. 230 specifying a control
signal for frame synchronization and a notification
signal; recommendation H. 242 specifying an
interconnection procedure up to 2 Mbit/s;
recommendation H. 261 specifying a video coding scheme
for P x 64 kbit/s (P = 1 to 30); and recommendation
H. 320 specifying the arrangement of a voice/video
communication system. Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing the schematic
arrangement of a conventional TV conference terminal
apparatus. Referring to Fig. 6, this apparatus
includes a video camera 10 for photographing, e.g.,
participants in a conference at one station, a
monitor 12 for displaying images photographed at this
station and/or other stations participating in a
conference, a speaker 14, a microphone 16, an operation
unit 18 for performing control, e.g., panning, tilting,
and zooming, of the camera 10 at the station and
cameras in other stations, switching control of the
cameras, and the like, input/output equipment terminals
20 including a keyboard of a computer, a still picture
input device, a pointing device for inputting plotting
pictures, such as a mouse or digitizer, a sub-monitor
for displaying images from other auxiliary equipment,
and a main body 22 of the TV conference system.Fig. 7 shows the detailed arrangement of the main
body 22. Referring to Fig. 7, a video I/F 30 serves to
connect the camera 10 and the monitor 12 to the main
body 22. The video I/F 30 has image processing
functions of performing screen division, image
synthesis, character synthesis, and the like. A video
coder/decoder (CODEC) 32 codes a video signal from the
video I/F 30 and decodes received coded video
information. A voice I/F 34 serves to connect the speaker 14
and the microphone 16 to the main body 22, and has
voice processing functions such as an echo cancel
function. A voice coder/decoder (CODEC) 36 codes a
voice signal from the voice I/F 30 and decodes the
received coded voice

<CLAIMS>
A communication conference schedule managing apparatus (Fig.1, 60)
comprising:


receiving means (22) for receiving
from a conference station located in a first area

first schedule
information (Fig.4) represented in the local time of said

first area; and characterised by
said receiving means comprising
time difference converting means (26) for converting

the first schedule information to second schedule
information (Fig.5) represented in the local time of a

second area on the basis of the local time difference between
the first area and the second area;
output means (20) for outputting the second schedule
information,

   wherein each of the first and second schedule
information is utilised to determine the

time span from start to end of a predetermined schedule.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
schedule managing apparatus is a terminal set in the

second area, and wherein said receiving means receives
the first schedule information from a first terminal set

in the first area.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said
schedule managing apparatus is a terminal set in the

first area, and wherein said output means outputs the 
second schedule information to a first terminal set in

the first area.
Apparatus according to claim 1, and adapted to relay
a communication between a first terminal set in the first

area and a second terminal set in the second area.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein
said output means (20) is adapted to display the second

schedule information.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the first
schedule information is schedule information of a user

of a terminal set in the first area.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, further
comprising a video camera for taking an image.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, further
comprising a speaker for outputting received audio

signals.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, further
comprising a microphone for inputting audio signals for

transmission.
Apparatus according to any preceding claim, wherein 
said receiving means receives ID information indicating

the first area, and wherein said time difference
converting means converts the first schedule information

to the second schedule information on the basis of the
ID information.
Apparatus according to claim 10, wherein said time
difference converting means has a table for outputting

the second schedule information as an address for the ID
information and the first schedule information.
A system comprising a communication conference schedule managing apparatus
as claimed in claim 4, and a terminal having output means

for outputting schedule information relayed to it by said
communication conference schedule managing apparatus.
A method of managing schedules
of communication conferences

comprising the steps of: receiving
first schedule information from a

conference station located in a
first area, the

schedule information representing a schedule in the local
time at said first area,

said step of receiving
utilising a time difference

converting step for converting the first schedule
information to second schedule information represented

in the local time of a second area on the basis of the
local time difference between the first area and the second

area; outputting the second schedule information, and
utilising the first and second schedule information to

determine the time span from start to end of a 
predetermined schedule.
A method according to claim 13, wherein the first
and second schedule information is received at a schedule

managing apparatus and is output to at least one other
terminal.
A method according to claim 14, wherein the first
and second schedule information is received from

differing video conferencing terminals and is sent to a
third video conferencing terminal.
