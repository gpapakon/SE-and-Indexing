Method for deriving at least one quality signal
(D, AFE_AMU) dependent on the quality of a

received signal, wherein

the received signal is demodulated,
an auxiliary signal (FST16) dependent on the
field strength and a further auxiliary signal

(DD2) are derived from the demodulated signal,
the auxiliary signal (FST16) and the further
auxiliary signal (DD2) are combined in order to

form the at least one quality signal
(D, AFE_AMU), and
the further auxiliary signal (DD2) is formed by
combination of a first signal (AHD), dependent

on the amplitude of the components of the
demodulated signal which lie above a useful

frequency range, and a second signal (ASD),
dependent on the symmetry of the sidebands of a

modulated subcarrier contained in the
demodulated signal.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
that
, in a stereo multiplex signal, the higher-frequency
components lie above 60 kHz.
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the modulated subcarrier is a subcarrier-frequency
stereo difference signal. 
Method according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that

the subcarrier-frequency stereo difference signal
is demodulated by multiplication by a reference

carrier coupled to the subcarrier, and 
in that
, in
order to derive the second signal (ASD) dependent

on the symmetry of the sidebands, a signal
obtained by multiplication of the subcarrier-frequency

stereo difference signal by a reference
carrier phase-shifted through 90° is compared with

a threshold value after absolute-value formation.
Method according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that

the subcarrier-frequency stereo difference signal
is demodulated with a reference carrier that is

not coupled to the subcarrier, 
in that
, in order
to derive the second signal (ASD) dependent on the

symmetry of the sidebands, two signals obtained by
multiplication of the subcarrier-frequency stereo

difference signal by two reference carriers that
are phase-shifted through 90° relative to one

another are multiplied by a respective correction
signal derived from a phase shift between the

subcarrier and the respective reference carrier
and are then added, and 
in that
 the signal
obtained by the addition is compared with a

threshold value after absolute-value formation.
Method according to either of Claims 4 and 5,

characterized in that
 the absolute-value formation
is effected by squaring.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the demodulated signal is a
stereo multiplex signal with a radio data signal,

and 
in that
 the first signal is derived from
components of the stereo multiplex signal above

60 kHz and the second signal is derived by
comparison of the sidebands of the carrier-frequency

stereo difference signal, and 
in that
 
the first and the second signal, for the purpose

of forming the further auxiliary signal, are
conducted via a logic circuit (12) and a pulse

width discriminator (13).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that

second signal (ASD), for the purpose of forming

the further auxiliary signal (DD2), are conducted
via a logic circuit (12) and a pulse width

discriminator (13).
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 an amplitude demodulator and
a low-pass filter (6) are provided for deriving

the auxiliary signal (FST16).
Method according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that

the amplitude-demodulated received signal is fed
to two low-pass filters (6, 7) having different

cut-off frequencies, and 
in that
 the outputs of
the low-pass filters are connected to inputs of a

changeover switch (8), which is controlled by the
further auxiliary signal (DD2).
Method according to Claim 10, 
characterized in
that
 the output signal (AMC) of the changeover
switch (8) is weighted (9) and multiplied by the

further auxiliary signal (DD2), conducted via an
asymmetrical integrator (21), for the purpose of

forming a quality signal (AFE_AMU), which serves
for attenuating an AF signal, obtained from the

demodulated signal, during interference.
Method according to one of the preceding claims,

characterized in that
 the weighted auxiliary
signal (FST16) and the further auxiliary signal

(DD2) conducted via an asymmetrical integrator
(20) are multiplied (24) in order to form a 

quality signal (D), which serves for reducing the
stereo channel separation during interference.
