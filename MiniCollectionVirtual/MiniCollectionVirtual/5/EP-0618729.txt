<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a system capable of performing 
compatible transmitting and receiving processes, 

regardless of whether a TV signal on the transmission 
side is a high-resolution signal or a low-resolution 

signal or of whether the reception side is a high-resolution 
display unit or a low-resolution display 

unit. On the transmission side, a frequency division 
circuit (150) divides a high-resolution TV signal into 

signals in a plurality of frequency bands. The signals 
in each frequency band are converted into signals of a 

horizontal and vertical low band (a low-resolution TV 
signal band). The converted signals are coded by coding 

units (110-113), which transmit the coded signals. On 
the reception side, the coded signals multiplexed on the 

transmission side are separated and decoded at decoding 
units (202-205). A frequency synthesizing circuit (220) 

restores the frequency bands of the decoded signals to 
the original bands. Then, the resulting signals are 

displayed with a high resolution. A low-resolution 
signal is coded and then transmitted. The coded signal 

is decoded on the reception side. The decoded signal is 
interpolated at an interpolation circuit (270). The 

interpolated signal is then displayed on a high-resolution 
display unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a video-signal
transmitting and a video-signal receiving apparatus for
use in a video-signal transmitting and receiving system
which subjects a video signal, such as a television
signal, to digital high-efficient coding for
transmission and reception.There has been a system which subjects a high-resolution
television signal (hereinafter, referred to
as a high-resolution TV signal) to high-efficient
coding, transfers the coded signal, and causes a
receiver to decode the transmitted signal. The high-resolution
TV signal is supplied to a high-efficient
coding circuit of an HDTV (high-definition television)
encoder. The HDTV encoder is composed of a high-efficient
coding circuit and an output buffer. The
high-efficient coding circuit subjects the signal
supplied from the input terminal to high-efficient
coding and supplies the coded signal to the buffer. The
output buffer is a smoothing buffer for outputting a
transmitted signal at a constant transmission rate to a
transmission line. The output buffer, when the amount
of signals stored exceeds a specified value, feeds back
a control signal to the high-efficient coding circuit in
order to reduce the amount of code supplied from the
encoding circuit. The constant-rate signal supplied
from the HDTV is supplied to an input buffer of an HDTV 
decoder via the transmission line. The HDTV decoder is
composed of an input buffer and a decoding circuit. The
input buffer stores the signals supplied from the
transmission line, and supplies a constant-rate signal
to the decoding circuit. After the signal supplied to
the decoding circuit has been decoded, this decoded
signal is supplied to an HDTV monitor, which displays
it.With the system thus constructed, the high-resolution
TV signal supplied via the input terminal is
subjected to high-efficient coding at the HDTV encoder,
and then is supplied to the HDTV decoder via the
transmission line. The HDTV decoder decodes the signal
supplied via the transmission line, and then displays
the decoded signal on the HDTV monitor.With this system, when a low-resolution TV signal
is transmitted, the low-resolution signal is converted
into a high-resolution TV signal once, and then the converted
signal is transmitted on the same transmission
line. When the display unit of the receiver can only
make a low-resolution display, the high-resolution TV
signal transmitted must be decoded by the HDTV decoder,
and then the decoded signal be converted into a low-resolution
signal (down convert).As described above, with
