<ABSTRACT>
The drain cleaning machine (10) comprises a 
frame (12) supporting a rotatable drum (56, 60) which is 

driven by a motor (110) through an endless belt (112). 
The drum (14) contains a flexible drain cleaning snake 

(24) which is rotatable with the drum (56, 60) and 
axially displaceable into and out of the drum (56, 60), 

and the frame (12) supports a snake feeding device (18) 
through which the snake (24) extends and by which the 

snake (24) is displaced into and out of the drum (56, 
60). The snake feeding device (18) includes three 

rollers (only two 162, 166 shown in Fig. 7) which engage 
the snake (24) to feed the latter inwardly and outwardly 

of the drum in response to rotation of the drum, and two 
of the rollers (such as roller 166 in Fig. 7), are 

radially adjustable relative to the snake (24) through 
corresponding cam arrangements (176) so that the feeding 

device (18) can accommodate snakes (24) having different 
diameters.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sewer cleaning
machines and, more particularly, to improvements in
sewer cleaning machines of the character having a
flexible plumbers cable or snake coiled within a
rotatable drum from which the snake is withdrawn and
inserted into a pipe or sewer to be cleaned and by which
the snake is rotated to achieve such cleaning.A disadvantage in sewer cleaning machines
heretofore known resides in the snake feed mechanisms by
which the plumbers snake is displaced outwardly and
inwardly of the drum. Most often, the snake feeding
mechanism is comprised of three rollers spaced apart to
provide an opening through which the snake extends and
which rollers are adapted to engage the snake so as to
cause the latter to move inwardly or outwardly of the
snake drum in response to rotation of the drum.
Generally, two of the rollers are radially adjustable
relative to the snake axis so as to enable the feed
mechanism to accommodate snakes having different
diameters. The third roller is generally spring biased
so that the snake is firmly captured between the three
rollers. In sewer cleaning machines of this known type
as disclosed, for example, in US-A-4,580,306, on which
the two-part form of claim 1 is based, the arrangements
by which the two rollers are adjustable have been
structurally complex and have made it extremely
difficult to obtain accurate adjustment of the two
rollers relative to the axis of the feed mechanism.
Structural complexity not only adds to the manufacturing
cost but also often makes the operation of the mechanism
cumbersome. The inability to obtain accurate adjustment
of the rollers relative to the axis of the feed
mechanism can result in an erratic action during use of
the machine, and such action imposes undesirable wear on
the component parts of the snake feeding mechanism and
causes instability with respect to the support of the
machine during operation thereof. The object of the invention is the provision
of a sewer cleaning machine having an improved snake
feeding mechanism which is structurally simple and in
which snake engaging rollers are readily and selectively
adjustable relative to the axis of the feed mechanism,
thus to minimize the time required for adjustment and to
optimize the accuracy of adjustment.In order to achieve this there is provided
in accordance with the invention a sewer cleaning
machine comprising frame means, drum means supported on
said frame means for rotation about a drum axis, means
to rotate said drum means, flexible snake means in and
rotatabl
