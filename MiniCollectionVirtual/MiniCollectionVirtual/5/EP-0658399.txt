<ABSTRACT>
An automatic rapid-attachment chuck device for 
attaching axially insertable chucks (1) to machine 

chuck heads (2) in bell-forming machines for 
thermoplastic pipes, wherein the chucks (1) are 

removably and projectingly constrained to a fixed 
support (6) in the machine chuck heads (2), which 

support (6) is provided with a flange (4) for 
centring the chuck (1), said flange (4) having 

through holes (5) for connecting the chuck (1) to 
the chuck head (2). The device comprises: a plate 

(7) affording slots (8) of varying breadth and 
rotatable on a fixed support (6) on activation of 

means (11) for actuating and mobile inrelation to 
the flange (4); pins (9), provided with heads 

(10), said heads (10) being conformed such as to 
be able to transit freely through the holes (5) in 

the flange (4) and through the slots (8) in the 
plate in a chuck (1) mounting position on the 

chuck head (2); interefering geometrically with 
all of the slots( 8) in a second extreme position 

in which the plate (7) is rotated in relation to 
the first extreme position, such as to resist a 

detachment of the chuck (1) from the chuck head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automatic rapid-attachment
chuck device for attaching axially
insertable chucks to machine chuckheads in bell-forming
machines for thermoplastic pipes. The
chucks are removably and projectingly constrained
to a fixed support in the machine chuckheads,
which support is provided with a flange for
connecting the chuck, said flange being provided
with through holes for connecting the chuck to the
chuckhead (see e.g. GB-A- 432 528).Bell-forming machines of the above type are
equipped with a series of interchangeable chucks,
variously shaped, which are combined with heating
elements to shape ends of pipes (also of various
dimensions) into different geometrical
conformations.In such machines the chucks are connected to the
flange by a series of conventional bolts which
insert into special holes made in the flange 
itself, so that the chuck is removable and
interchangeable in relation to various operations.
The fundamental drawback of this connection system
is that the substitution of the chucks requires
bolt loosening and tightening operations which
slow down production.Further, in order to achieve an equal tightening
of all the bolts, torque wrenches are necessary as
is a logical tightening order of the bolts.The aim of the present invention, as it is
characterized in the following claims, is thus to
eliminate the above-mentioned drawbacks.The invention solves the problem by providing an
automatic chuck rapid-connection device
comprising the features of the preamble of claim 1,
which further
comprises:
a plate affording at least two circumferential
keyhole slots of varying breadth and being at
least rotatingly constrained to a fixed support
such as to be rotatably mobile in relation to the
flange;at least two pins, provided with heads fixed to
the chuck facing towards the flange and with the
heads of the pins arranged projectingly, said
heads being conformed such as to be able to
transit freely through the holes in the flange and 
through the slots in the plate in a chuck mounting
position on the chuck head wherein the plate is
arranged in a first extreme rotation position with
respect to the flange; said heads interfering
geometrically with all of the slots in a second
extreme position in which the plate is rotated in
relation to the first extreme position, such as to
resist a detachment of the chuck from the chuck
head of the machine;
means for actuating the rotation of the plate
between the first and the second extreme
positions.The fundamental advantage obtained with the
present
