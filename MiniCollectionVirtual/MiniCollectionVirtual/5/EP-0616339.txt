<ABSTRACT>
A method of estimating the crystal grain size of a nuclear fuel pellet, 
consisting of the steps of heating a plurality of kinds of UO₂ powder in dry air 

at a predetermined temperature increasing rate and determining a rate of 
weight variation occurring due to the oxidation of each powder
; determining 
for each kind of powder a temperature at which the composition of the 

powder reaches from UO
2+x
 phase to U₃O₇ phase, on the basis of a change 
in the weight variation rate; manufacturing sintered pellets from a plurality 

of kinds of UO₂ powder the reaching temperatures of which are known; 
measuring the crystal grain sizes of a plurality of kinds of resultant pellets; 

identifying the correlation between the reaching temperatures determined to 
U₃O₇ phase and the crystal grain sizes measured of the sintered pellets; determining 

a temperature at which sample UO₂ powder reaches U₃O₇ phase 
under the same conditions; and estimating the crystal grain size of a sintered 

pellet manufactured from the UO₂ powder, on the basis of this phase 
reaching temperature and the above-mentioned correlation. The crystal 

grain size of a UO₂ sintered pellet manufactured from UO₂ powder can be 
estimated from the oxidation behavior of UO₂ powder without manufacturing 

the sintered pellet actually. This enables the crystal grain size measuring 
cost to be reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for estimating 
crystal grain sizes of uranium dioxide (UO₂) sintered pellets to 
be used as nuclear fuel. In particular, it relates to a method 
for estimating crystal grain sizes of UO₂ sintered pellets 
according to oxidation behavior of UO₂ powder. Such UO₂ sintered pellets are tightly enclosed in coating 
tubes made of zircaloy, and are used as nuclear fuel. Recently, in order to make the life of the nuclear fuel to 
be long to enable continuous operation for a long period of light 
water reactors or fast breeder reactors, it is advanced to 
realize a high degree of combustion of nuclear fuel. When the 
nuclear fuel is allowed to have a high degree of combustion, the 
amount of fission products (FP) generated from nuclear fuel 
pellets is increased. Among the products, gaseous one such as 
radon (Rn) scarcely make solid solutions in the matrix of the 
nuclear fuel pellet, which diffuse into the crystal grain 
boundary and generate bubbles there. Swelling occurs due to the 
bubble formation, and the volume of the pellet increases to give 
stress to the coating tube. This makes a cause to generate a 
mechanical interaction (PCI, Pellet Clad Interaction) between the 
pellet and the coating tube. In addition, the FP gas diffused 
into the grain boundary is released to the exterior of the pellet 
later, which increases the internal pressure of the fuel rod to 
make a cause to decrease the thermal conductivity of the gap  
 
between the pellet and the coating tube. In order to prevent the increase in PCI and the decrease in 
the thermal conductivity, it has been attempted that the nuclear 
fuel pellet is allowed to have a large grain size so as to 
enclose the FP gas in the pellet. This is based on the fact that 
although the generation of the FP gas itself cannot be 
suppressed, when the pellet is allowed to have a large grain 
size, for example, when the crystal grain size is made to be two-fold, 
the arriving distance to the grain boundary of the FP gas 
generated in the crystal grain becomes two-fold, and consequently 
the release speed of the FP gas becomes half. Until now, methods for increasing the crystal grain size of 
the UO₂ sintered pellet have been disclosed in Unexamined 
Published Japanese Patent Application No.2-242195/1990; 
Unexamined Published Japanese Patent Application No.3-287096/1991;

No.4-70594/1992 and the like. According to these methods, nuclear fuel pellets having
