<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing an amorphous alloy ribbon by a single roll liquid
quenching method.Various types of soft magnetic alloys exhibiting high
saturation magnetic flux densities have been developed as
magnetic core materials for use in transformers, magnetic
heads, choke coils or the like in recent years.For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 4(1992)-4393
discloses a soft magnetic alloy having the composition
represented by the general formula:
(Fe1-aMa)100-x-y-z-bCuxSiyBzM'b
   wherein M is Co and/or Ni, M' is at least one element
selected from the group consisting of Nb, W, Ta, Zr, Hf, Ti
and Mo and a, x, y, z and b satisfy the relationships:
0≤a≤0.5, 0.1≤x≤3, 0≤y≤30, 0≤z≤25, 5≤y+z≤ 30 and 0.1≤b≤30,
   the soft magnetic alloy having a texture, at least 50
% of which is composed of fine crystal particles having an
average particle size of 1000 Å or less, while the balance
is substantially amorphous. The microcrystalline soft 
magnetic alloy is described as exhibiting low core loss and
low magnetostriction.It is fully described in Japanese Patent Publication
No. 4(1992)-4393, Y. Yoshizawa and K. Yamauchi: Journal of
the Magnetics Society of Japan, 13, 231 (1989), Y.
Yoshizawa and K. Yamauchi: Journal of the Japan Institute
of Metals, 53, 241 (1989) and Y. Yoshizawa and K. Yamauchi:
Material Science and Engineering, A133, 176 (1991) that, of
the microcrystalline soft magnetic alloys having the above
composition, those having the composition of the above
formula in which, however, M' is at least one element
selected from the group consisting of Nb, W, Ta and Mo and
a, x, y, z and b satisfy the relationships: a=0, 0.5≤x≤2,
5≤y≤20, 5≤z≤11, 14≤y+z≤25 and 2≤b≤5, have not only
especially high saturation magnetic flux density as well as
low core loss and low magnetostriction values.The fundamental process for producing the above
microcrystalline soft magnetic alloy is disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 3(1991)-219009.
The fundamental process comprises the step of quenching a
melt having the above composition to thereby form an
amorphous alloy and the step of conducting a heat treatment
to thereby form fine crystal particles having an average
particle size of 1000 Å or less. However, the particulars
as to how each of the above steps is performed are not
disclosed in the above publication. Further, with respect
to the technology for mass-producing an amorphous alloy 
ribbon as a first step of the production of the
microcrystalline soft magnetic alloy
