<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ice nucleating agent derived from sallow-thorn (sea-buckthorn) (Hippophae rhamnoides) which is used in the freezing, texturing or cryoconcentration of products, and to a method for preparing an agent of this type, in which the said agent is extracted from the berries or the leaves of the sallow-thorn.

<CLAIMS>
Ice nucleation agent extracted from the sallow-thorn
(Hippophaë).
Agent according to claim 1, characterized in that the
sallow-thorn is 
Hippophaë rhamnoides
, 
Hippophaë
salicifolia
, 
Hippophaë tibetana
 or 
Hippophaë neurocarpa
.
Agent according to claim 1, characterized in that it is
an aggregate comprising a proteinic part and a lipidic

part.
Method for producing an ice nucleation agent wherein an
extract is prepared
 from the berries or leaves of the
sallow-thorn containing the said agent.
Production method according to claim 4, characterized
in that the berries and/or leaves are extracted with a

pectin, mono-, oligo- and/or polysaccharide solution.
Production method according to claim 5, characterized
in that the said solution is chosen from the group

consisting of solutions of alginates, polygalacturonic
acid, amylose, amylopectin, polymannans, arabinose,

galactose, lactose, glucose, fructose and sucrose.
Method according to claim 4, characterized in that in
order to extract the crushed or ground leaves and/or

berries, they are mixed with 1 to 200 volumes of a solution
containing 0.0001 to 2 % by weight of pectin and/or 0.0001

to 2 % by weight of at least one saccharide, for 1 to 30
min., a solid part is then separated and a liquid part is

collected. 
Method according to claim 7, characterized in that the
said solid part of the mixture is subjected to at least one

new extraction.
