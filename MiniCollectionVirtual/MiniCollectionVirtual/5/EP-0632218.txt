<ABSTRACT>
A brush seal device for sealing a high pressure area from a 
low pressure area. The brush seal device comprises an annular 

sideplate having a first side facing the high pressure area and a 
second side opposite the first side, an annular backplate having a 

first side facing the low pressure area and a second side opposite 
the first side, and a plurality of bristles between the second 

side of the sideplate and the second side of the backplate. The 
backplate is moveable in a radial direction relative to the 

annular sideplate and the plurality of bristles extend inwardly 
from an outer peripheral edge of the sideplate. The brush seal 

device further comprises a retaining washer between the first side 
of the backplate and the low pressure area, wherein the retaining 

washer includes a cavity proximate the first side of the 
backplate, the cavity having an adjustable pressure therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a brush seal device for sealing high pressure areas
from low pressure areas and an apparatus having high pressure and low pressure areas in
accordance with the generic clauses of claims 1 and 13.Such a brush seal device is already known from document WO 92/05378 which
discloses a seal assembly comprising a brush seal member including a plurality of bristles
disposed between a pair of support plates. One support plate faces the high pressure side of
the seal, whereas the other support plate faces the low pressure side. The free ends of the
bristles bear on the component against which the seal is to be effected. Similarly, the support
plate includes a rubbing surface which extends to and contacts the surface against which the
seal is to be effected. The support plate is fixed and immovable relative to the support plate.Over the last decade, brush seals have emerged to be a very
promising technology for sealing high pressure areas from low
pressure areas such as those found in gas turbine engines.
Indeed, there is a substantial reduction, e.g., an order of
magnitude, in brush seal leakage flow over the present day
technology of labyrinth seals, the main disadvantage associated
with labyrinth seals being that the clearance of the seal around
the shaft tends to increase appreciably over time due to shaft
excursions and thermal growth. The resulting increase in
parasitic leakage can cause as much as 17 percent loss in power
and 7.5 percent increase in specific fuel consumption in the case
of engines.One drawback of current brush seal designs is that the
minimum clearance between the backplate and the shaft must be at
least great enough to accommodate various transients that the seal 
is expected to experience. Some of the transients include thermal
growth of the shaft, centrifugal growth of the shaft, runout of
the shaft, thermal bowing of the shaft on heat-up, shaft movement
due to acceleration (turning acceleration), shaft vibration, and
eccentricity of the seal housing with respect to the shaft center
line.Seal leakage increases and maximum pressure capability of the
seal decreases, however, as the clearance between the shaft and
backplate is increased. Thus, seal performance is improved if the
seal can be made with a smaller backplate clearance.Features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in
the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from
the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.
