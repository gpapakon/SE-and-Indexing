<ABSTRACT>
The invention consists in passing an oil-in-water emulsion through a nozzle so as to form spherules which are allowed to fall countercurrentwise in cold air and are recovered in an aqueous solution containing a crosslinking agent.

A method for preparing spherules of one or several active 
food or medicinal ingredients, characterized in that one prepares 

an emulsion of oil in water, based on a food and/or medicinal 
charge of a protein and water, this emulsion is caused to pass 

into a nozzle so as to form spherules, the formed spherules are 
allowed to drop in a tower in contraflow with cold air, and they 

are recovered in an aqueous solution containing the cross-linking 
agent. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
food charge is made up of vitamins chosen from vitamins A, E, D

A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
protein is gelatine. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the oil 
is chosen from vitamin A, vitamin E, rapeseed oil, groundnut oil, 

sunflower oil or cod-liver oil. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
emulsion contains, moreover, an antioxidant chosen from tert-butyl-3 

hydroxy-4 anisole, ditert-butyl-3.5 hydroxy-4 toluene, 
ethoxy-6 dihydroxy-1.2 trimethyl-2.2.4 quinoline and tert-butyl-2 

dihydroxy-1.4 toluene. 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
emulsion contains, moreover, a surfactant chosen from dilauryl 

thiodipropionate, an alkaline or alkaline-earth stearate, 
stearoyl-2 lactylate of sodium or of calcium, or carboxymethyl-cellulose. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the emulsion is formed by mixing an oil-based 

solution or one containing one or several active ingredients and  
 

optionally, one or several antioxidants and an aqueous solution 
containing the protein, optionally one or several surfactants. 
A method according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
emulsion is formed by a mixture of approximately 10 to 30% by 

weight of the oily solution and 70 to 90% by weight of the 
aqueous solution. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that, before proceeding with the separation of the 

spherules, a cross-linking step is carried out. 
A method according to claim 9, characterized in that the 
cross-linking agent is an aldehyle chosen from acetaldehyde, 

glutaraldehyde, glyoxal. 
A method according to claim 10, characterized in that the 
cross-linking agent is constituted by an aqueous solution containing 

5 to 20% by weight of the cross-linking agent or the pure 
product. 
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that the emulsion containing the active ingredient 

or ingredients and the protein is passed through a vibrated 
nozzle containing one or several perforations, in concurrent flow 

with an air jet, the spherules formed at the outlet of the nozzle 
are placed into contact with a contraflow of cold air and are 

received in an aqueous solution containing an aldehyde. 
A method according to claim 12, characterized in that the 
diameter of the perforations of the nozzle is approximately 100 

microns. 
A method according to claim 12, characterized in that the 
temperature of the air injected in concurrent flow with the 

emulsion lies between the ambient temperature and 60째C.  
 
A method according to claim 12, characterized in that the 
temperature of the air injected in contraflow with the drop of 

the spherules lies between -20째C and 20째C. 
A method according to claim 12, characterized in that the 
system for recovering the spherules is made up of a tank for 

recovering the spherules, containing an aqueous solution of the 
cross-linking agent, which tangentially feeds a rotating drum 

which makes it possible to separate the spherules from the cross-linking 
solution. 
A method according to claim 16, characterized in that the 
cross-linking solution is kept at a temperature comprised between 

5 and 20째C. 
A method according to claim 16, characterized in that after 
passing over the drum, the cross-linking solution is recycled 

towards the system for recovering the spherules by passing in an 
intermediate stage through a heating system.
