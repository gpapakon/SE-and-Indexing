The present invention relates to certain 
benzimidazole anthelmintic agents which, quite 
unexpectedly, are topically and parenterally active and 
are thus suitable for transdermal and parenteral 
(especially intramuscular) administration. FR-A-2046114 discloses benzimidazole derivatives which 
are substituted by a carbamate group. The compounds are 
indicated inter alia as anthelmintics. The benzimidazole derivatives of the present invention 
are represented by the formula:- 
and their non-toxic salts, wherein R1, which is in the 5(6)- position, is either
