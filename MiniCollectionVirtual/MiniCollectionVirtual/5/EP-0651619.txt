<ABSTRACT>
A hospital bed (100) supported on a wheeled base (104), a ventilator (26) mounted on a ventilator cart (18) with a wheeled base (20) and a care cart (200) are docked together and rollable as a unit. The wheeled bed base has outspread Y-shaped arms for docking the ventilator cart, the latter falling within the footprint (126) of the former. The care cart (200) carries a battery housing (203) and oxygen, and means for connecting electricity and oxygen to the ventilator, as well as structure for attaching the cart wheeled base (201) to the bed wheeled base. A motorized dolley (401) is incorporated into another embodiment to provide motorized transport of the combination. A safety switch (120) prevents the lowering of the bed surface onto the ventilator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to medical
equipment, and more particularly to the integration of
patient life support systems into the dimensions of a
hospital bed. More specifically, this invention relates to
patient ventilators and carts for supporting ventilators,
and care carts for supplying patient ventilators with DC
electricity, oxygen and air, in combination with hospital
beds for movement with the beds.The patient critical care environment in hospitals
is becoming increasingly crowded due to the number of pieces
of medical equipment associated with critical care, which
pieces of equipment embody various critical care
technologies. Specifically, within the critical care
environment there is generally located a critical care bed, 
around which are positioned a ventilator, I.V. pumps,
various monitors, and one or more computer terminals for
entering patient care data. The numerosity of pieces of
equipment spaced about a critical care hospital room and the
patient bed results in patient care inefficiency, as a care
provider must continually monitor and operate all the pieces
of equipment, while such are not advantageously
ergonomically arranged.In addition to the critical care environment being
crowded and somewhat cumbersome around which to work, the
transfer of the various pieces of equipment along with the
patient on the critical care bed from one room to another
within the hospital is tedious, time consuming and difficult
to manage. One reason is that the critical care bed, and
the various technologies associated with the critical care
environment, are generally each individually supported on
wheeled support structures. Therefore, when transferring
the patient from one room to another room, several pieces of
wheeled equipment must simultaneously be rolled to the new
location. Not only is this task cumbersome, but also it is
time consuming. Further, since all the various technologies
must be first disconnected from their respective connections
to AC power at the wall in the room, the various
technologies must either operate on some sort of stand-by
scheme during transportation, or must be manually operated. 
Swift transfer of the various pieces of equipment with the
critical care bed from one room to another is mandatory in
order to minimize down time on these pieces of equipment yet
is made very difficult by the clutter associated with the
several individual pieces of equipment.Use of a ventilator in a critical care context
normally requires the use of one or more oxygen and air
canisters or

(10) during transport of the cart (200, 300, 400), bed

(10) and ventilator (26), the care cart comprising a
support frame including a base (201, 301) having casters

(202, 302) thereon, the support frame including a
generally vertical portion (207, 315), a lower generally

horizontal portion (209, 304) mounted to and extending
forwardly from the vertical portion and an upper generally

horizontal portion (219, 316) mounted to the vertical
portion (207, 315), the upper and lower portions (209,

219, 304, 316) being spaced, and structure (229) on the
base (201, 301) for removably connecting the cart to the

hospital bed base thereby permitting the cart and bed to
be rolled as a unit characterised in that the care cart

(200, 300, 400) is adapted to dock to the foot end (10a)
of the hospital bed (10) which has a periphery which when

projected downward to the floor defines a footprint (126),
in that the upper generally horizontal portion (219, 316)

also extends forwardly from the vertical portion (207,
315) so as to define a generally C-shaped configuration

when the care cart (200, 300, 400) is viewed in side
elevation, the upper and lower portions (209, 219, 304,

316) being spaced so as to receive therebetween the foot
end (10a) of the hospital bed (10) when the vertical

portion (207, 315) is abutted against the foot end (10) of
the hospital bed, and in that the vertical and horizontal

portions (207, 209, 219, 304, 316) and base (201, 301) are
dimensioned so that the care cart (200, 300, 400) falls

substantially within the footprint (126) of the hospital
bed (10) when docked thereto. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the
