<ABSTRACT>
Novel optical fiber devices (amplifiers and lasers) are disclosed. The 
devices comprise one or more optical "cavities", depending on the type of device. 

The cavities typically are formed by means of in-line refractive index gratings in a 
length of silica-based optical fiber. The gratings typically have peak reflectivity of at 

least 98%. Use of such cavities enables CW pumping of the devices, making the 
devices suitable for use in optical fiber communication systems. In an exemplary 

embodiment the device is a Raman amplifier for 1.3 µm signal radiation, and in 
another exemplary embodiment the device is a Raman laser having an output 

suitable for pumping an Er-doped fiber amplifier. An exemplary pump radiation 
source is a laser diode-pumped CW Nd:YAG laser.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of optical fiber amplifiers and lasers,
and to apparatus (e.g., optical fiber communication systems) that comprises such
amplifiers and/or lasers. The amplifiers and lasers exemplarily are Raman or
Brillouin amplifiers and lasers, or involve four-photon mixing.It is well known that stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) in optical fiber
can, in principle, be utilized for amplification of signal radiation as well as for a
laser. Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) and four-photon mixing in optical
fibers are also known. See, for instance, "Optical Fiber Telecommunications", S. E.
Miller et al., editors, Academic Press 1979; pages 127-133, 133-135, and 140-144,
respectively. See also "Tunable Lasers", L. F. Mollenauer et al., editors, Springer
Verlag, pp. 279-301. Optical fiber lasers and amplifiers based on SRS, SBS, or
four-photon mixing will herein collectively be referred to as "non-linear interaction"
(NLI) lasers or amplifiers, as the case may be.To the best of my knowledge, NLI lasers or amplifiers have so far not
been used in optical communication systems.One of the reasons for the neglect of NLI lasers and amplifiers is the
difficulty of achieving in the optical fiber the required high CW pump radiation
intensities. For instance, with regard to SRS, much of the relevant prior art involves
the use of pulsed pump radiation. The obtainable high peak power of the pump
pulses results in substantial SRS despite the relatively low efficiency of SRS. Pulsed
pump power is, of course, not useful for, e.g., signal amplification in an optical fiber
communication system, or for a continuous wave (CW) laser. For example, use of a
pulsed amplifier would require synchronization of the pump laser to the signal. This
is not only impractical but also would negate one of the main advantages of optical
amplification, namely, the possibility of changing the signal transmission rate
without making any changes in the amplifiers.In view of the many desirable characteristics potentially possessed by
NLI amplifiers and lasers, it would be desirable to find a way to, inter alia, increase
efficiency such that CW pumping becomes practical. For instance, it would be
desirable to have available NLI devices that can efficiently utilize CW pump
radiation from commercially available laser diodes or laser pumped solid state
diodes to produce high intensity CW radiation of a wavelength that is of interest for 
optical communications (e.g., 1.55µm), or to amplify radiation of a wavelength
(e.g.,
