<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing panels by compressing fragments 
of bonded sheet material, such as thermoplastic resin 

coated cardboard, in a press at a temperature not lower 
than the softening point of the thermoplastic resin, 

comprising the addition of additives in the form of inert 
fillers or in the form of thermoplastic or thermosetting 

resins to modify the mechanical properties of the panel 
obtained and the addition of a layer of fine wood shavings 

on the outer face to improve its surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to a method for manufacturing panels 
in sheet form and the product obtained thereby. There are known panels composed of incoherent materials of 
various kinds, impregnated with suitable binders and then 
moulded in a press. A typical example of application of this technique 
consists of panels composed of fragments of wood of 
suitable particle size, impregnated with thermosetting 
resin. This material is cold-preformed into the shape of a 
slab which is subsequently compressed into its final 
configuration in a heated mould, where the binder is 
polymerized. Panels of this kind have extensive empty spaces inside 
them, due to the fact that the quantity of binding resin 
must be maintained within permissible limits from the 
economic and technological point of view. In certain 
applications their consequent poor mechanical strength and 
high hygroscopicity is not appreciated. Likewise, there are known panels obtained by milling and 
subsequently hot-pressing scraps and rejects of 
multilayered materials; the methods used for obtaining 
such panels are described in patents DE-A 2.258.169 and 
DE-B 1.151.374. Due to the intrinsic properties of the raw material used, 
these panels have an uneven surface which prevents them  
 
from being given an aesthetically perfect finish either by 
painting, or by applying a paper coating. US-A-2 686 143 discloses a method for manufacturing panels made 
of two layers of fine particle-sized wood shavings, mixed with 
resins, distributed onto the outside of a mass of shredded 
fibrous waste material and then compressed, as in the preamble 
of claim 1. The scope of this invention is to obtain panels composed 
internally of scraps of multilayered materials and 
externally of fine particle-sized wood shavings. Said 
panels are consequently characterized by a low degree of 
hygroscopicity, limited swelling in water, good thermal 
and acoustic insulation, deriving from the first component 
material, and an excellent finish and even surface 
deriving from the second component material. The method for manufacturing panels according to the 
invention is characterized by the fact that fine 
particle-sized wood shavings, suitably mixed with resins, 
are distributed on the outside of a mass of fragments of 
sheet material composed of thermoplastic resin coated 
cardboard, the composition thus obtained being compressed 
in a mould at a temperature higher than the softening 
point of the thermoplastic material and higher than the 
polymerizing temperature of

A method for manufacturing a composite panel wherein 
fine particle-sized wood shavings, suitably mixed with 

resins, are distributed onto the outside of a mass of 

shredded fibrous waste material, the composition thus 
obtained being compressed in a mould at a temperature 

higher than the polymerizing temperature of the resin 
used, and subsequently cooled,
 
characterized in that 


a) the shredded waste is a thermoplastic resin coated 
cardboard and 
b) the moulding temperature is higher than the softening 
point of the thermoplastic resins.

are subjected to drying before being hot-pressed, to 

decrease their moisture content to values below 4%, 
preferably around 2%. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, in which said fragments 
are subjected to preheating at a temperature lower than 

the softening point of the thermoplastic resin, before 
being hot-pressed. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, in which, upon completion 
of the hot-compression phase, the compressed material is 

cooled under pressure until it reaches an internal 
temperature considerably lower than the softening point of 

the thermoplastic resin.

are compressed with pressure values ranging from 

approximately 15 to 25 kg/cm

Method as claimed in claim 1, in which the  
 

hot-compression phase has a duration ranging from 15 to 30 
seconds per millimetre of thickness of the finished panel. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, in which thermoplastic 
resin is added as an additive dispersed in the mass to the 

fragments of multilayered material. 
Method as claimed in claim 7, in which the 
thermoplastic resin is present in percentages ranging from 

5 to 15% in weight of the fragments, preferably around 
10%. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, in which thermosetting 
resin is added as an additive dispersed in the mass to the 

fragments of multilayered material. 
Method as claimed in claim 9, in which the 
thermosetting resin is added as an additive in percentages 

ranging from 5 to 15% in weight of the fragments, 
preferably from 5 to 10%. 
Method as claimed in claim 1, in which an inert filler 
is added as an additive dispersed in the mass to the 

fragments of multilayered material.
