<ABSTRACT>
To determine the adhesion/slip characteristic of the tyres of a road vehicle fitted with an anti-lock system designed for individual wheel control, in an initial target braking phase braking pressure is applied to only one vehicle wheel in such a way that the initial deceleration desired by the driver is obtained. During this initial test braking phase the absolute brake slip  lambda B and the concomitant adhesion  mu B are continuously determined, as soon as the vehicle deceleration z no longer increases through the braking of the test wheel alone and/or the braked vehicle wheel decelerates to a greater degree than would correspond to a predetermined threshold, test braking is stopped and braking is continued by applying pressure to the other vehicle wheels; corresponding test braking phases are performed cyclically for all the wheels.
