<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a stand with an approximately L-shaped arm 
which comprises a first portion (1) and a second portion (3) which extends 

approximately perpendicularly to the first portion and a free end of which supports at 
least one medical apparatus (7, 9). The first portion (1) comprises a free end which is 

connected, to, for example a floor (13) of an examination space 
via
, a bearing (17), in 
such a manner that it can be rotated from a neutral position in opposite directions 

through an angle of Δ radians in a plane of rotation parallel to the floor. A bundle of 
cables (21) extends from a space (19) at the side of the floor (13) which is remote from 

the examination space to parts of the device. The bundle of cables (21) is shaped 
approximately as a flat ribbon having a largest thickness t equal to the thickness of the 

thickest cable and a width w equal to the sum of the thicknesses of the cables. The 
bundle (21) extends to the free end of the second portion via an opening (25) in the 

floor (13) at the area of the bearing (17) and a cavity (29) formed in the arm (1, 3) and 
extending over the entire length of the arm. The cavity (29) has an approximately 

rectangular cross-section with a width which equals at least w and a height which equals 
at least t, the width direction of the cavity in the first portion (1) of the arm extending 

substantially parallel to the floor surface. The cables of the bundle (21) are secured in a 
first cable holder (23) which is situated at the side of the bearing (17) which is remote 

from the second portion (3) of the arm and which defines the positions of the cables 
relative to one another. At the area of the transition between the first portion (1) and the 

second portion (3) of the arm there is provided a protrusion (31), so that the height of 
the cavity (29) in the second portion of the arm locally equals at least t+αw.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a medical apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1.An apparatus of this kind is known, for example from EP-A-0 317 223.The boundary surface may be, for example the floor or the ceiling of the
examination space. In the known apparatus an X-ray source and an X-ray detector, for
example an X-ray image intensifier tube, are attached to the free end of the second portion
via a support. The support may have any shape, for example a C-arc, which is rotatably
connected to the free end of the second portion of the arm. The X-ray source and the X-ray
detector are attached to oppositely situated ends of the support. The bundle of cables
comprises, for example power supply cables for powering the apparatus, tubes for the
supply of cooling liquid and signal cables for transmitting instructions to the apparatus
and for transferring measurement signals from the apparatus to processing equipment
installed elsewhere. The cables preferably extend in a cable trough provided behind the
boundary surface. In the known apparatus the cables extend via a separate cable entry
housing by the side of the bearing from the boundary surface to the relevant parts of the
apparatus, i.e. the cavity formed in the arm. By using the separate cable entry housing by
the side of the bearing the cables can extend from the boundary surface to the relevant
parts of the apparatus without being spread across the floor so that an operator could
easily trip over the cables. This is achieved because the bundle of cables is shaped as an
approximately flat ribbon having a largest thickness t and a width w, and extends to the
free end of the second portion via an opening in the boundary surface near the bearing via
the cable entry housing and a cavity formed in the arm and extending over the entire
length of the arm, said cavity having an approximately rectangular cross-section of a
width which at least equals w and a height which at least equals t, the width direction of
the cavity in the first portion of the arm extending substantially parallel to the boundary
surface, the cables of the bundle being secured in a first cable holder which is situated at
the side of the bearing remote from the second portion of the arm and defines the 
positions of the cables relative to one another, and that at the area of the transition
between the first and the second portion of the arm there is provided a protrusion.The entire bundle of cables now extends through the tubular cavity in the arm.
Because the bundle is shaped as a flat

<CLAIMS>
A medical apparatus, comprising a stand with an approximately L-shaped arm,
which comprises a first portion (1) having a free end which is connected, via a bearing

(17), to a boundary surface (13) of an examination space in such a manner that it can be
rotated from a neutral p
osition into opposite directions through an angle of α radians in a
plane of rotation which is parallel to said boundary surface, and also comprises a second

portion (3) which extends approximately perpendicularly to the first portion and to a free
end of which there is attached at least one medical apparatus (7, 9), a bundle of cables

(21) extending from a space (19) at the side of the boundary surface which is remote from
the examination space to parts of the apparatus, wherein the bundle of cables (21) is

shaped as an approximately flat ribbon having a largest thickness t and a width w, and
extends to the free end of the second portion, 
via
 an opening (25) in the boundary surface
(13) near the bearing (17) and a cavity (29) formed in the arm (1, 3) and extending over

the entire length of the arm, said cavity having an approximately rectangular cross-section
of a width which at least equals w and a height which at least equals t, the width direction

of the cavity in the first portion (1) of the arm extending substantially parallel to the
boundary surface, the cables of the bundle being secured in a first cable holder (23) which

is situated at the side of the bearing remote from the second portion (3) of the arm and
defines the positions of the cables relative to one another, and that at the area of the

transition between the first and the second portion of the arm there is provided a
protrusion (31)

characterized in that

the largest thickness t of the flat ribbon is equal to the thickness of the thickest
cable of the bundle,
the width w of the flat ribbon is equal to the sum of the thicknesses of the cables,
the protrusion (31) is provided in such a way that the height of the cavity in the
second portion of the arm locally equals at least t+αw, and 
the bundle of cables (21) extends through an opening (27) formed in the ring-shaped
bearing (17).
An apparatus as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that near the protrusion (31)
in the second portion (3) of the arm there is provided a second cable holder (33) which

defines the positions of the cables relative to one another.
