<ABSTRACT>
An expanded television program delivery system is disclosed which
allows viewers to select television and audio program choices from a series of

menus. Menus are partially stored in a set top terminal in each subscriber's home.
The menus may be reprogrammed by signals sent from a headend or from a central

operations center. The system allows for a great number of television signals to be
transmitted by using digital compression techniques. An operations center with

computer-assisted packaging allows various television, audio and data signals to be
combined, compressed and multiplexed into signals transmitted on various

channels to a cable headend which distributes the signals to individual set top
terminals. Various types of menus may be used and the menus may incorporate

information included within the video/data signal received by the set top terminal.
A remote control unit with icon buttons allows a subscriber to select programs based

upon a series of major menus, submenus, and during program menus. Various
billing and statistics gathering methods for the program delivery system are also

disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial Number 07/991,074 filed December 9, 1992, entitled TELEVISION PROGRAM PACKAGING AND DELIVERY SYSTEM WITH MENU DRIVEN SUBSCRIBER ACCESS. The following publications are also based on the above-referenced patent application: EP-A-0 673 578 to EP-A-0 673 582, EP-A-0 674 824, EP-A-0 732 027, EP-A-0 732 030, EP-A-0 732 031, and US-A-5 307 627.The invention relates to television entertainment systems for providing television programming to consumer homes. More particularly, the invention relates to a remote control for a cable television delivery system.Advances in television entertainment have been primarily driven by breakthroughs in technology. In 1939, advances on Vladmir Zworykin's picture tube provided the stimulus for NBC to begin its first regular broadcasts. In 1975, advances in satellite technology provided consumers with increased programming to homes.Many of these technology breakthroughs have produced inconvenient systems for consumers. One example is the ubiquitous three remote control home, having a separate and unique remote control for the TV, cable box and VCR. More recently, technology has provided cable users in certain parts of the country with 100 channels of programming. This increased program capacity is beyond the ability of many consumers to use effectively. No method of managing the program choices has been provided to consumers.Consumers are demanding that future advances in television entertainment, particularly programs and program choices, be presented to the consumer in a user friendly manner. Consumer preferences, instead of technological breakthroughs, will drive the television entertainment market for at least the next 20 years. As computer vendors have experienced a switch from marketing new technology in computer hardware to marketing better useability, interfaces and service, the television entertainment industry will also experience a switch from new technology driving the market to consumer useability driving the market.Consumers want products incorporating new technology that are useful, and will no longer purchase new technology for the sake of novelty or status. Technological advances in sophisticated hardware are beginning to surpass the capability of the average consumer to use the new technology. Careful engineering must be done to make entertainment products incorporating new technology useful and desired by consumers.PATENT ABSTRACTS OF JAPAN vol. 011, no. 370 (P-642), 3 December 1987 & JP 62 140134

<CLAIMS>
A method for selecting a program category submenu on a television system using a main menu having a menu cursor and menu options corresponding to program categories and using a remote control with menu select buttons, a cursor movement control, and a go button, the method comprising the steps of:

generating a main menu with menu options corresponding to program category submenus, the menu options being selectable by using a menu cursor;
selecting a program category submenu from the main menu comprising the steps of:

moving the menu cursor to a menu option corresponding to a desired program category submenu using the cursor movement control on the remote control; and
depressing the go button on the remote control when the cursor is located at the desired menu option; and

wherein the desired program category submenu is additionally selectable at any time by performing the step of depressing one of the menu select buttons, each menu select button corresponding to one of the program category submenus; and

generating the selected program category submenu.
The method of claim 1, wherein the cursor movement control is a joystick and the step of moving the menu cursor
 comprises the step of:

pivoting the joystick to move the cursor in a direction corresponding the direction the joystick is pivoted.
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein the cursor movement control is a ball and the step of moving the menu cursor comprises the step of:

rotating the ball to move the cursor in a direction corresponding the direction the ball is rotated.
The method of claim 3, wherein the ball is a depressible ball and the step of depressing the go button comprises the step of:

depressing the depressible ball.
The method of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the cursor movement control is a plurality of cursor movement buttons, each representing a different direction of cursor travel, and wherein the step of moving the menu cursor comprises the step of:

depressing a cursor movement button to move the cursor in a direction corresponding to the direction of cursor travel represented by the depressed button.
The method of claim 5, wherein the cursor movement buttons are textured and the step of moving the menu cursor further comprises the step of:

identifying a cursor movement button by physically feeling its texture.
The method of claims 5 or 6, wherein the cursor movement buttons are colored differently from the menu select buttons, and the step of selecting a program category submenu further comprises the step of:

distinguishing between the cursor movement buttons and the menu select buttons by visually observing button color.
The method of claims 5, 6, or 7, wherein the cursor movement buttons are each bevelled and the step of moving the menu cursor further comprises the step of:

identifying a cursor movement button by physically feeling the direction in which the cursor movement button is bevelled.
The method of any of claims 1 to 8, wherein the menu select buttons each have an icon representing a program category disposed thereon, and wherein the step of depressing one of the menu select buttons comprises the step of:
