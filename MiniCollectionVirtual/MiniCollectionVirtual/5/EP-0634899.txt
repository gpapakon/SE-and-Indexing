<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvement, through
treatment with novel enzyme preparations, in the feed
value of fibrous crops for use by ruminant and monogastric
animals. More particularly, the invention relates to the
fractionation of cellulase enzymes derived, for example,
but not in particular, from Trichoderma species, to
increase their effectiveness in improving the availability
of the energy from cellulose and hemicellulose units of
fibre to the microbes in the rumen of ruminant species
and/or the digestive processes of monogastric and
ruminants - monogastric animals do not have enzyme systems
capable of utilizing fibre. Further, these novel enzyme
products can be used to treat fibrous crops during
conservation with beneficial effects on the ensilage
process as well as the treatment of conserved crops and
the fibrous byproducts of other crops e.g. citrus pulp,
cotton, etc. just prior to feeding to the animal crops.
The invention also relates to methods for the preparation
of said enzyme products.As fibrous crops mature the yield of energy per
unit of land area increases, but the availability of
energy, i.e. cellulose and hemicellulose decreases because
of the process of plant lignification in which the
cellulose chains in the plant cell walls become lignified
through complex cross linkages. This results in a
considerable reduction in the digestibility of the dry
matter components to the animal. Thus, whilst from an
economic viewpoint, the crop should be harvested mature,
at peak dry matter yield, the limitation on digestibility
of energy forces harvest to take place at a more immature 
stage with a lower dry matter yield and potential problems
with conservation due to lower dry matter content. By
breaking such cross links between cellulose units, enzymes
can allow crops to be harvested at later maturities, thus
increasing energy yield without the usual reduction in
digestibility. Also, the same process can make sugars
available to silage microbes, thus improving the
conservation of such crops under adverse weather
conditions where dry matter content is low.The preservation of fibrous crops (grass, legumes,
whole crop cereals - maize, sorghum, etc.) for future use
as animal feed basically relies on either the removal of
water by drying (hay etc.) or the exclusion of air and
acidification of the mass to a point where the activities
of epiphytic spoilage micro-organisms (yeasts, moulds and
bacteria) are controlled and the enzyme activities of the
plant material are restricted. In practice, a pH of
