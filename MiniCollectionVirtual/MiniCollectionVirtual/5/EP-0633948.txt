<ABSTRACT>
An alloying additive of fine metallurgical structure is made by providing a melt of a suitable alloying material, for example an aluminium-based melt containing one or more alloying components for treating an aluminium-based melt for grain refinement, modification, conductivity reduction and/or addition of alloying metal, and applying one or more substantially unatomised streams of the melt to a cooling surface, e.g. the cylindrical exterior surface of a water-cooled rotating metal drum, to produce a splat product, which is then arranged into a dosage form suitable for making measured alloying additions, preferably having first been granulated.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an alloying additive. More particulary it relates to a
method of making an alloying additive of fine metallurgical structure.It has for many years been appreciated that it can be advantageous for an
alloying additive to have such a structure, and that such a structure can be achieved by
casting a melt of the alloy in such a way that the cooling to which the alloy is subjected
when passing from the molten to solid states is relatively rapid.For example, our French Patent Specification No. 2133439 relates to
aluminum-based alloying additives comprising a transition metal, normally titanium,
and boron. Such alloying additives are added to aluminium-based melts to provide
grain refinement. The main active component of the alloying additive is boride
particles, normally titanium diboride, TiB2. In order to maximise the effectiveness of
those particles, the specification teaches subjecting the melt of the alloying material, as
soon as possible after formation of the TiB2 particles, to rapid cooling to form the solid
alloy, thereby minimising the extent to which the TiB2 particles can grow in size. The
preferred method of rapid cooling taught in FR 2133439 is casting into a mould of
thermally conducting material such as copper, which is preferably water cooled. A less
preferred alternative suggested is a splat quenching process comprising atomising the
melt to form droplets and projecting the molten droplets by means of a current of inert
gas against a cooled smooth surface, so that the molten droplets are rapidly solidified
by impact against the smooth surface without adhering to it. The former method entails
the danger that the rate of cooling will be insufficient, and also the moulded product
will not be of suitable form for many applications. The latter method is expensive to
operate.European Patent Specifications Nos. 0398449 A1 and 0421549 A1 disclose
methods of producing strontium-aluminium alloying additives to be used as modifiers
for aluminium-silicon alloys. They both make use of the knowledge that solidification
of the melt at a relatively high rate of cooling will result in a fine metallurgical
structure in the solidified alloying additive. In both cases the process for achieving the
required rate of cooling involves atomisation of the melt. In EP 0398449 Al, the
atomised droplets are quick-cooled to obtain solid particles which are subsequently
processed to consolidate them. In EP 0421549 A1 the atomised particles are collected
as solid material on a collecting surface.
