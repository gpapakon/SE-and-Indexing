<ABSTRACT>
A soft-walled plastics bottle (B) for beer, or another carbonated beverage, is fitted at its neck with a flow-controlling device comprising a non-return valve which prevents the beverage being dispensed except under pressure exerted by squeezing the bottle. The valve, which comprises a displaceable body (108) which is urged into engagement with a seating (130) by a spring (106), serves to prevent air entering the container and also provides for the beverage to be forced under pressure through an orifice into an expansion chamber (170) before being dispensed. In the case of beer, such treatment of the beer can result in a desirable de-carbonation and the formation of a good head on the beer.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Collapsible container with dispensing valve, especially for beer.The present invention relates to apparatus for dispensing beverages, particularly, but not exclusively, for dispensing beer from bottles.It is becoming increasingly common for beer to be sold, particularly, but not exclusively, for domestic consumption, in bottles formed from flexible plastics material, known in the trade as PET bottles. Typically, these soft-walled bottles contain between 1 and 3.5 litres of beer. Beer sold in such bottles may have a more satisfactory flavour than beer sold in cans since sterilisation of these bottles can be carried out before they are filled so avoiding the heat sterilisation which filled cans must undergo and the deterioration of the flavour of the beer which can occur during such sterilisation.A disadvantage with beer sold in PET bottles arises because it is typically sold in such quantity that the purchaser of the beer may wish to consume it over a period of, say two to four days. However, over this time the beer in the bottle commonly deteriorates through contact with air which has entered the bottle while beer is being poured from it. The beer will also go flat as the gas dissolved in it disperses. The result of this is that following opening of the bottle the beer deteriorates relatively rapidly, being of a very poor standard after, typically, forty-eight hours. Furthermore, the loss of dissolved gas means that as time elapses following the opening of the bottle, the head produced when the beer is poured deteriorates in quality. 

 It is an aim of the present invention to provide apparatus which can overcome or at least ameliorate these problems.-From a first of its aspects the invention provides a collapsible beverage container in which flow-controlling means comprising a non-return valve operative at a dispensing outlet from the container is arranged to permit beverage to be dispensed effectively only by squeezing the container to increase the pressure within the container.Preferably, the valve prevents ingress of air through the outlet under both dispensing and non-dispensing conditions. The beverage may thereby be dispensed in a controlled manner, while the non-return valve prevents the flow of air into the bottle during and following dispensing of the beverage.The apparatus may further comprise closure means selectively operative to resist flow of beverage and other fluids into and out of the bottle.The apparatus may be a unit having means for attachment to a bottle. This arrangement allows

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A collapsible beverage container in which flow-controlling means comprising a non-return valve (60,62,68;130,108,106) operative at a dispensing outlet from the container is arranged to permit beverage to be dispensed effectively only by squeezing the container (B) to increase the pressure within the container.
2. A container according to claim 1 in which the flow-controlling means forms, in the direction of flow, a first restricted flow passage (58;130) and an expansion chamber (10;170) through which beverage being dispensed can flow relatively freely.
3. A container according to claim 2 in which the flow-controlling means forms also a second restricted flow passage (24;142) through which the beverage passes from the expansion chamber.
4. A container according to either of claims 2 and 
'
3 in which the non-return valve is operative at the first restricted flow passage.
5. A container according to any one of the preceding claims in which the non-return valve comprises a body (64;160) which is resiliently biased towards a seating (60;130) against which it forms a seal, the body becoming displaced from the seating to permit beverage to be dispensed only upon a sufficient pressure being developed in the container by squeezing the container;
6. A container according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein the valve is arranged to prevent ingress of air 


through the outlet under both dispensing and non-dispensing conditions.
7. A container according to any one of the preceding claims in which the flow-controlling means is provided by a device which is secured by engagement within a neck of the container.
8. A container according to any one of claims 1 to 6 in which the flow-controlling means is provided by a device which is secured by engagement with an externally threaded neck of the container.
9. A container according to any one of the preceding claims which is in the form of a soft-walled bottle (B) .
10. A container according to any one of the preceding claims which contains a carbonated beverage.
11. A flow-controlling device for a collapsible beverage container according to any one of claims 1 to 10, the device being arranged for securement to provide a dispensing outlet from the container and forming, in the direction of flow, a first restricted flow passage (58;130) and an expansion chamber (10;170) through which beverage being dispensed can flow relatively freely, the device providing a non-return valve (60,62,68;130,108,106) which permits beverage to be dispensed effectively through the outlet only under pressure from the interior of the container (B) .
12. A device according to claim 11 which forms also a second restricted flow passage (24;142) through which the beverage passes from the expansion chamber. 


13. A device according to either of claims 11 and 12 in which the non-return valve is operative at the first restricted flow passage.
14. A device according to any one of claims 11, 12 and 13 in which the non-return valve comprises a body (64;160) which is resiliently biased towards a seating (60;130) against which it forms a seal.
15. A device according to any one of claims 11 to 14 which is arranged to be secured by engagement within a neck of the container.
16. A device according to any one of claims 11 to 14 in which the device is arranged to be secured by engagement with an externally-threaded neck of the container.
