<ABSTRACT>
Circuit supporting modules form a three-dimensional communication interconnect mesh. Each module has fewer than six sets of connectors, preferably four. The preferred three-dimensional communication interconnect is a tetrahedral lattice having a regular, isotropic, three-dimensional topology in which each module connects to its four physically closest neighbors. The structure of the tetrahedral interconnect is isomorphic with a diamond lattice structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of 
computer architecture. Typically, computers include an 
interconnected set of computational modules, each 
performing a specific task or function. These modules 
are assembled into a full system by connecting the 
appropriate wires that lead in and out of each through a 
bus. The bus allows various computer chips or boards to 
communicate and exchange data. This standardized 
approach has allowed system designers to physically 
arrange components in any manner they require without 
worrying about the details of interconnections. However, the bus architecture seriously constrains 
the efficiency of communication among modules. This is 
a key limitation in today's quest for faster, more 
efficient computers. Since buses serialize all 
communications, they create a bottleneck. To make 
matters worse, the total capacity of the 
intercommunication remains roughly constant as the system 
size and the demand for the exchange of information 
increases. Moreover, the time taken by each transaction 
must accommodate the physical length of the bus, a 
crucial factor that limits the communication bandwidth in 
all but the shortest buses. These deficiencies reduce 
the viability of the bus as a basis for communication in 
modern computer systems. To increase the efficiency in communication among 
modules, modern multiprocessor architectures have been  
 
designed with various different topologies other than the 
bus. Such topologies include one-dimensional, two-dimensional 
and three-dimensional topologies. WO-91/19258 discloses a multi-dimensional processor array 
for processing data structured in one or more dimension. This 
array is reconfigurable so that if one or more dimensions of 
the multi-dimensional array are not needed, the array can be 
automatically be reconfigured as an array having fewer 
dimensions. DE-A-3616821 discloses an N-dimensional processor 
structure for an information network. The structure has 
processors arranged in a regular mathematical hyperprism. The size of future computer systems mandates the use of 
three-dimensional topologies for efficient utilization of 
space and communication bandwidth. For maximum flexibility, 
these topologies should have incremental expandability, 
arbitrary scalability and support fast static and dynamic 
communication. Embodiments of the present invention may provide a 
modular and high-performance communications substrate that 
standardizes the mechanical, electrical and logical 
interconnection among
