<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
centrifuge rotor, and in particular, to a centrifuge rotor having
a predetermined localized region thereon where the occurrence
of a failure due to fatigue is most probable.A centrifuge rotor is a
relatively massive member used within a centrifuge
instrument to expose a liquid sample to a centrifugal force
field. The rotor is provided with a plurality of cavities in which
containers carrying the liquid sample are received. The rotor
has a central, axial mounting recess provided therein, whereby
the rotor may be mounted to a shaft extending from a source of
motive energy.The possibility exists that, in use, the rotor may break
apart due either to i) fatigue failure of the rotor material,
ii) the imposition of excessive centrifugally induced stresses
when the rotor is rotated past its predetermined rated speed
(overspeed failure), or iii) failure from the accumulated effects
of corrosion caused by sample spillage. A failure produces a
number of rotor fragments each of which carries a portion of
the kinetic energy of the rotor. A containment system is
provided in the centrifuge instrument in order to contain the
resultant rotor fragments within the confines of the
instrument, thus avoiding damage to people and/or property. The size of the fragments usually depends upon the cause
of the rotor failure. In a rotor failure caused by corrosion, for
example, the fragments are relatively small, because the region
of the rotor affected by corrosion is the sample receiving cavity
near the rotor periphery. Rotor failure caused by fatigue or
overspeed may be more severe.The most severe form of rotor failure is a so-called "bi-hub"
failure, in which the rotor breaks into two relatively
massive fragments. The origin of the failure in a bi-hub failure
is usually in the vicinity of the rotor mounting recess. In such
a failure, although the containment system is designed to
contain the fragments within the instrument, the impact of the
fragments may cause movement of the instrument in the
laboratory.Various forms of mechanical arrangements are known
which minimize the possibility of rotor failure due to
overspeed. One class of overspeed protection arrangement
includes a frangible member which fractures when an
overspeed condition is imminent to mechanically disconnect
the rotor from its source of motive energy. United States

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A centrifuge rotor operable to rotate about an axis
of rotation at a predetermined operating speed, the

rotor (10) having a body with an undersurface (22B)
and a skirt,
characterized by
a relatively thin skirt portion (38) disposed on the
undersurface (22B), the skirt portion having defined

thereon a localized region (12) which exhibits a
stress therein that is greater than the stress present

in any other portion of the rotor when the rotor
is operating at the predetermined operating speed,
so that, over operation time, the probability that
rotor (10) failure will occur only in the localized

region (12) of the skirt (38) is enhanced, and that,
in case of failure, a fragment of relatively small

mass separates from the skirt portion (38).
The centrifuge rotor of claim 1 wherein portions of
the undersurface (22B) of the body are removed to

define a predetermined number of bosses (26), the
relatively thin skirt portion (38) being defined

between at least one pair of adjacent bosses (26).
The centrifuge rotor of claim 1 or 2 wherein the
skirt (38) has a weight (42) disposed thereon.
The centrifuge rotor of claim 3 wherein the weight
(42) is disposed on the inside surface (38I) of the

skirt (38). 
The centrifuge rotor of claim 3 wherein the weight
is disposed on the outside surface (38E) of the

skirt (38).
The centrifuge rotor of one of claims 3-5 wherein
the weight (42) is integrally formed with the skirt

(38).
The centrifuge rotor of one of claims 3-6 wherein
the weight (42) is separate from and mounted on the

skirt (38).
The centrifuge rotor of one of claims 1-7 wherein
the skirt (38) has a stress riser (46) therein, the

stress riser defining the localized region (12) on
the skirt (38) which exhibits a stress therein that

is greater than the stress present in any other portion
of the rotor (10) when the rotor is operating

at the predetermined operating speed.
The centrifuge rotor of claim 8 wherein the stress
riser (46) is defined by at least one hole (48).
The centrifuge rotor of claim 8 wherein the stress
riser (46) is defined by at least one notch (50).
The centrifuge rotor of claim 8 wherein the stress
riser (46) is defined by at least one groove (52).
