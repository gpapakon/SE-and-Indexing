<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for driving the two halves (5) of a centrally-opening door at a substantially constant speed along an arc of a circle, where the door aperture is wide and said mechanism takes up limited vertical space, particularly in lift, building or vehicle doors. Each half (5) of the door is connected to a pivot arm (13) linked at one point (P, Q) to a secondary drive (20) using a chain or a synchronous belt (21) which is slightly elongatable by means of a resilient compensating element (24). Both secondary drives (20) are driven by a motor (17) via a common primary drive including two stages (18 and 19) separated by a frictional torque limiter (33).

<CLAIMS>
A mechanism for controlling a centrally opening double-leaved 
door by said leaves sliding in opposite directions 

along a horizontal arc of a circle, comprising two 
pivoting control arms (13), which each cooperate with a 

leaf (5) in order to drive it and which are mounted on an 
articulation having a vertical axis close to the centre 

(C) of the arc of a circle, a motor (17), and 
transmission means connecting the motor to the control 

arms by at least one flexible traction device,
characterised in that
 each control arm (13) is associated 
with a secondary transmission (20) having a flexible 

traction device (21) which moves over two wheels (22, 23) 
having vertical axes and which is connected by an 

articulation to a determined point (P, Q) of the arm, a 
first of the said wheels being driven by the motor by 

means of a primary transmission (18 and 19). 
A mechanism according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the flexible traction device (21) 
of the secondary transmission contains an elastic 

compensating element (24) enabling it to lengthen in 
order to follow the arc-shaped trajectory (30, 31) of the 

connection point (P, Q) of the arm. 
A mechanism according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the compensating element (24) 
comprises two parts (25, 27) designed to slide one on the 

other and a compression spring (28) interposed between 
the said parts. 
A mechanism according to Claim 3,
characterised in that
 one (25) of the said parts is 
connected to the arm (13) by the said articulation.  

 
A mechanism according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the flexible traction device 
of the secondary transmission is associated with an 

arc-shaped guide in order to follow the arc-shaped 
trajectory (30, 31) of the connection point (P, Q) 

of the arm. 
A mechanism according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 it comprises two secondary 
transmissions (20) synchronously driven by the same 

primary transmission (18 and 19). 
A mechanism according to one of the preceding 
Claims,
characterised in that
 the primary transmission 
contains a transmission device (33) limiting the 

moment by friction, which is connected to the said 
first wheel (22) of each secondary transmission (20) 

by a positive transmission (19). 
A mechanism according to Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the said positive transmission 
(19) has a chain (35) or a synchronous belt and 

comprises an excess voltage detector (39) which is 
coupled to a control device of the motor (17). 
A lift comprising a cabin (4) provided with a 
centrally opening door having two leaves (5) by said 

leaves sliding in opposite directions along a 
horizontal arc of a circle, the door of the cabin 

being provided with a control mechanism (10) in 
accordance with Claim 1.  

 
A lift according to Claim 9,
characterised in that
 the said mechanism (10) is 
placed on a ceiling (8) of the cabin and is covered 

by a platform (40).
