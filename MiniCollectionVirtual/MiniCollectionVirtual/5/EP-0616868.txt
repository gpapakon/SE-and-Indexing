<ABSTRACT>
The invention is concerned with forming a groove 
(12) with a desired shape in a mold (11) inexpensively, 

easily and with high accuracy by means of discharge 
machining. 
There is provided a method of forming a groove by 
means of discharge machining, characterized by carrying 

out discharge machining a plurality of times to form 
deep openings (18), by inserting a stick-like electrode 

(17) into a material (11),- while shifting location of 
the machining so as to connect adjacent deep openings 

(18) with each other, and forming the groove (12) having 
a desired shape by means of said connected deep openings. 
Since it is possible to form the groove (12) with a 
desired shape by means of a stick-like electrode (17) 

with a simple shape, productivity is improved and also 
manufacturing cost is decreased. Further, even if the 

stick-like electrode (17) wears out, it is sufficient to 
exchange the inexpensive stick-like electrode (17). 

Furthermore, groove width (W) can be changed by 
adjusting pitch (P) between adjacent deep openings (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to method of forming a groove 
with a desired shape by means of electric discharge 
machining. In forming a groove with a desired shape in a 
material by means of conventional discharge machining, 
after making a forming electrode having a substantially 
similar shape to that of the groove by performing 
cutting and discharge machining of an electrode 
material, the groove is formed by performing discharge 
machining by inserting said forming electrode in the 
material. However, in forming a groove by means of such a 
conventional discharge machining, there is a problem 
that the operation of making the forming electrode needs 
much labour and time, and moreover involves high 
manufacturing cost, because it is required to produce 
the electrode with similar shape to that of the 
groove. Furthermore, because of the expensive cost of 
such a forming electrode, said electrode is used 
repeatedly, as a result of which the electrode is 
gradually consumed, which results in causing distortion 
of groove dimensions. An object of the present invention is therefore to 
provide a method of forming a groove by discharge 
machining by which it is possible to form a groove with  
 
a desired shape at low manufacturing cost and with ease 
and with high accuracy. The present invention provides a method of forming a 
shape in an object by making a series of openings by means 
of discharge machining, comprising the steps of: carrying 
out discharge machining to form a first deep opening by 
inserting a stick-like electrode into a material, 
retracting the electrode from the material, shifting a 
location of the stick-like electrode and performing 
discharge machining to form a second deep opening 
overlapping the first one to connect adjacent deep openings 
with each other, and forming a desired shape by means of 
repeatedly forming additional deep openings overlapping 
each other. The method of the invention is preferably further 
characterized by finishing a groove by shifting the stick-like 
electrode inserted in connected deep openings toward a 
neighbouring deep opening successively while performing 
discharge machining. Firstly, by inserting a stick-like electrode into a 
material, discharge machining is performed to form a deep 
opening which has the same shape as the stick-like 
electrode. Next, after once extracting said electrode 
from the material, discharge machining is performed again 
as described above, shifting the stick-like electrode in 
the lateral direction along the shape of
