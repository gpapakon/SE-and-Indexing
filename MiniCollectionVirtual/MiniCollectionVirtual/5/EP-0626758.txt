<ABSTRACT>
Power dissipation in precharge paths used in adiabatic dynamic logic 
circuitry is reduced by a precharge boost circuit (124,126) which decreases the 

impedance between a clock node (120) and an output node (122) in such logic 
circuitry and thereby increases the charging current from clock signal generator 

(Φ₀). In one example, a diode (124) used to precharge an output node in adiabatic 
dynamic logic circuitry is selectively shorted by a controllable switch (126) 

selectively connected in parallel with the diode when the output node is to be 
precharged.

<DESCRIPTION>
Application Serial No. [Dickinson 6] of Alex G. 
Dickinson, entitled Adiabatic Dynamic Logic, filed on the 
same day this application is being filed. Application Serial No. [Denker 15] of John S. Denker, 
entitled Adiabatic Dynamic Noninverting Circuitry, filed 
on the same day this application is being filed. The detailed description in the [Dickinson 6] 
application may be helpful to the reader in understanding 
the principles of this invention. Accordingly, that 
description is substantially reproduced in this 
application. This invention relates to logic circuitry. More 
specifically, this invention relates to precharge boost 
circuitry which is used in adiabatic dynamic logic 
circuitry. In standard logic circuitry, such as static and 
dynamic CMOS logic, nodes are charged and discharged in a 
completely irreversible, dissipative manner, using a 
switch to charge a node to a first potential and to 
discharge the node to a second potential. It has been 
proposed to attach such a node to a slew rate limited 
clock which in theory gradually, adiabatically, and 
reversibly charges and discharges the node. Logic 
circuitry using this technique is currently too 
complicated and uses too many transistors so that at 
normal speeds of operation any power savings for each 
transistor may be lost by the fact that many more 
transistors are used to accomplish simple logical 
operations. In addition, it has not been possible to 
completely avoid nonadiabatic transitions in some prior  
 
designs. The total power consumption of the entire 
circuit thus may not be much less than that used by 
nonadiabatic circuitry. Application Serial No. [Dickinson 6] cross-referenced 
above discloses and claims adiabatic dynamic logic 
circuitry which has reduced power dissipation and 
complexity. In some examples of the invention in that 
application, there may be a certain amount of power 
dissipation associated with precharging an output node to 
a predetermined level due to the presence of a diode in a 
precharge current path between a clock node and the output 
node. Under normal circumstances, this amount of power 
dissipation is of no appreciable importance. Logic 
circuitry in accordance with the invention of that 
application will nevertheless operate at significantly 
reduced power dissipation as compared to prior logic 
circuitry. In some instances, however, the output nodes 
of circuitry in accordance with that invention are 
connected to circuits having a large equivalent input 
capacitance. This is particularly
