<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to novel (R)-dimethyl 
N-tritylaspartate and novel (R)-alkyl N-trityl-4-oxo-5-phosphononorvalinate 
derivatives which are useful in the 
preparation of a class of beta-ketophosphonate NMDA 
antagonists. The class of beta-ketophosphonate NMDA antagonists is 
important in the treatment of epilepsy, nerve trauma such 
as that caused by stroke, cardiac arrest, hypoglycemia, and 
physical damage to either the brain or spinal cord, 
neurogenerative diseases, anxiety and for the relief of 
pain [European Application No. 91107955.6 of Jeffrey P. 
Whitten entitled Heterocyclic-NMDA Antagonists, filed May 
16, 1991]. This class of excitatory amino acid antagonists 
which act at the NMDA receptor complex can be described by 
formula I wherein R is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl: 
(R)-4-Oxo-5-phosphononorvaline derivatives of formula I 
have been synthesized by protecting (R)-aspartic acid as 
the CBZ oxazolone, converting the resulting acid to an acid 
chloride and then coupling with a cuprate to form the beta-ketophosphonate. 
A two step deprotection yielded the 
desired (R)-4-oxo-5-phosphononorvaline derivative of 
formula I after chromatography. In EP-A 4 188 63 beta ketophosphonate NMDA 
antagonists are disclosed. According to this 
document the synthesis of these compounds 
requires the step of protecting the free 
amino group of an aminoacid or derivative 
with a steroyl carbamate protecting group. The novel (R)-dialkyl N-tritylaspartates and novel (R)-alkyl 
N-trityl-4-oxo-5-phosphononorvalinate derivatives of 
the present invention are useful in the preparation of the 
class of beta-ketophosphonate NMDA antagonists. These 
compounds afford the (R)-4-oxo-5-phosphononorvaline 
derivatives of formula I with a high retention of chirality 
from readily available (R)-aspartic acid. In addition, the 
use of the novel (R)-dialkyl N-tritylaspartates and novel 
(R)-alkyl N-trityl-4-oxo-5-phosphononorvalinate derivatives 
of the present invention allows for a shorter synthesis 
with higher yields and avoids the use of copper. Further, 
the use of (R)-dimethyl N-tritylaspartate and (R)-methyl N-trityl-4-oxo-5-phosphononorvalinate 
derivatives of the 
present invention provides stable crystalline materials at 
every step thereby avoiding the necessity of 
chromatography. The present invention provides novel (R)-dialkyl N-tritylaspartates 
of formula II and novel (R)-alkyl N-trityl-4-oxo-5-phosphonomervalinate 
derivatives of formula III,  
 
 
wherein R and R' are simultaneously methyl or
