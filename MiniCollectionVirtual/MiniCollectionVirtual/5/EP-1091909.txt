<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for absorbing heavy metals or heavy metal ions from a medium containing heavy metals and/or heavy metal ions. The invention is characterized in that magnesium ferrate hydrate and/or magnesium aluminate ferrate hydrate and/or a mixture containing magnesium ferrate hydrate and/or magnesium aluminate ferrate hydrate is used as absorbing agent. The invention is particularly useful in processing contaminated water.

<CLAIMS>
A process for absorbing heavy metals or heavy metal
ions from a medium containing heavy metals or heavy

metal ions, 
characterised in that
 the medium is
treated with iron hydroxide or a mixture containing

iron hydroxide and a composition containing at least
one substance from the group comprising magnesium

hydroxide, magnesium oxide, partially decarbonised
dolomite, wherein, relative to the introduced iron

hydroxide and substances from the group comprising
magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide, partially

decarbonised dolomite, the molar ratio between iron
and magnesium is between 1:1 and 1:10.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

at least a proportion of the heavy metals and/or heavy
metal ions present in the medium is present as

complexes.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
,
relative to the introduced iron hydroxide and

substances from the group comprising magnesium
hydroxide, magnesium oxide, partially decarbonised

dolomite, the molar ratio between iron and magnesium
is between 1:2 and 1:4.
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

iron hydroxide and at least one substance from the
group comprising magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide,

partially decarbonised dolomite are mixed together
prior to treatment of the medium to yield a powder or

granular product. 
A process according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

iron hydroxide and at least one substance from the
group comprising magnesium hydroxide, magnesium oxide,

partially decarbonised dolomite are mixed together
prior to treatment of the medium to yield an aqueous

dispersion.
