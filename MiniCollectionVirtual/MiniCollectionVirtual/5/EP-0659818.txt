<ABSTRACT>
A polypropylene composition which contains a 
polypropylene and one or more ingredients selected from 

an antistatic agent and a surface-treated or untreated 
fine powdery silica gives a propylene stretched film 

having a well-balanced transparency, slip property and 
blocking resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polypropylene
stretched film superior in transparency, slip
property and blocking resistance.Polypropylene stretched films have been used
in wide variety of fields, including food packaging,
textile packaging etc., by virtue of their desirable
transparency and mechanical properties.Although polypropylene stretched films have
such desirable properties, they are not entirely free
from defects. The major problems are insufficient slip
property and blocking resistance.Various methods have already been proposed to
improve the insufficient slip property and blocking
resistance of polypropylene stretched films. Such known
methods include a method for improving blocking
resistance by the addition of zeolite, magnesium
silicate, etc. (for example, JP-B-52-16134 and JP-B-48-14423),
a method for improving transparency, slip
property and blocking resistance by the addition of fine
powdery silica (for example, JP-B-63-58170 and JP-A-4-288353),
and a method for improving transparency, slip
property and blocking resistance by the addition of a
thermoplastic synthetic resin which is substantially
incompatible with polypropylene (for example, JP-B-50-36262). However, these methods of adding such
inorganic fillers as zeolite, magnesium silicate, fine
powdery silica, etc. are not always satisfactory. Thus,
increasing the amount of such fillers incorporated into
a polypropylene film in order to attain sufficient
improvement of the slip property and blocking resistance
of the film generally reduces the transparency of the
film due to the development of voids caused by the
action of the inorganic fillers as the nuclei. As a
result, market value of the film is disadvantageously
lowered. On the other hand, the addition of the
thermoplastic synthetic resin accompanies a problem of
unsatisfactory thermal stability of the resin in the
course of melt-kneading.The object of the present invention is to
develop a polypropylene stretched film which has good
transparency, slip property and blocking resistance in
combination.In recognition of the situation, the present
inventors have made extensive study to improve the slip
property and blocking resistance of polypropylene
stretched film without greatly deteriorating its
transparency. As the result, it has been found that a
polypropylene stretched film which meets the aforesaid
object can be obtained by using a specified antistatic
agent and/or a specified fine powdery silica. The
present invention has been attained on the basis of
above finding.
