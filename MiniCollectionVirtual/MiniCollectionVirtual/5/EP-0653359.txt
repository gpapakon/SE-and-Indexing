<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a closure device (10) for a container (12) having a crimped edge (18) surrounding the container mouth (14). The closure device (10) comprises an adapter (46), a coupling ring (40) and a protective cap (26), the union ring (40) being arranged so as to be displaceable on the adapter (46). The adapter (46) has a plurality of downwardly extending snap-in arms (6) for gripping an annular flange (48) of a pump (20) and for engaging above and subsequently below the crimped edge (18) of the container (12). The protective cap (26) engages with the union ring (10, 100) over the adapter (4), so as to be axially displaceable, towards the container (12), a releasable interlock possibly being provided, by means of which the union ring (40) is fixed on the adapter (46). This design has the advantage that an intimate and tight connection between the closure device (10) and the container (12) can be achieved, which is considerably simplified by a single, axial fixture because the closure device can be supplied as a compact assembly unit which comprises the adapter (46), the union ring (40), the protective cap (26) and the pump (20).

Device (10; 110) for closing a container (12; 112), the opening (14; 114) 
of which is provided with a flange (18; 118), comprising a manually 

actuable pump (20; 120), which has a dispensing head (24; 124) and 
which is provided on its end remote from the container (12; 112) with an 

annular flange (48; 148), a substantially annular adapter (46; 146), which 
is provided at its upper end with an internal flange (52; 152) for engaging 

over the annular flange (48; 148) on the pump (20; 120) and with a lower 
portion which has (1) a recess or groove (56; 156) for receiving the 

container flange (18; 118) and (2) an internal projection (54; 154) for 
engaging the container flange (18; 118) with a snap action,
 
characterised in that 


the annular flange (48; 148) is provided on its underside with a sealing 
disc (50; 150), whereby the annular flange (48; 148) on the pump (20; 

120) can be fastened on the flange (18; 118) whilst compressing the 
sealing disc (50; 150); 
a stop (60; 160) normally adopts its stop position projecting beyond the 
outer surface of the internal flange (52; 152) on the adapter (46; 146) 

under an elastic biasing force and may only be unlatched by a force 
exerted when chattering on the closure device (10; 110); 
and a collar ring (40; 140) may be pushed onto the adapter (46; 146) to 
the stop (60; 160) with a friction fit to form a closure device constituting 

a single assembly unit such that when the assembly unit is chattered onto 
the container (12; 112), the flange (18; 118) firstly engages in the groove 

(56; 156) above the projection (54; 154) whilst bending the inner  
 

projection away and subsequently the collar ring (40; 140) unlatches the 
stop (60; 160) by moving inwardly in opposition to the biasing force 

acting on it and is movable on the adapter (46; 146) to a lower position in 
which release of the snap engagement of the container flange (18; 118) in 

the adapter (46; 146) is prevented and all working steps are performed in 
a single installation step. 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the collar ring (140) 
is held in its lower position by the external engagement force of the stop 

(160). 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that a cylindrical, hollow 
cylindrical guide socket (30; 130), which projects from the underside of 

the top wall (28; 128) of a protective cap (26; 126), substantially 
surrounds the collar ring (40; 140) and is provided with a stepped 

abutment surface (38; 138) for an upper end (42; 142) of the collar ring 
(40; 140). 
Device as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in that the cylindrical inner 
wall of the guide socket (30; 130) of the protective cap (26; 126) is 

provided with a cylindrical broadened portion (36; 136) for the collar 
ring (40; 140) which is bounded at the upper end by the abutment surface 

(38; 138), against which the upper inwardly bent over end (42; 142) of 
the collar ring (40; 140) engages. 
Device as claimed in one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that provided  
 

on the inner surface of the end (144) closest to the container of the collar 
ring (40; 140) there is a peripheral retaining groove (178) which 

cooperates with the stop (160) on the adapter (146) before installation on 
a container (112). 
Device as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that arranged on the inner 
surface of the collar ring (140) axially spaced above the retaining groove 

(178) there is a second peripheral retaining groove (180), in which the 
stop (160) on the adapter (146) engages in the installed state of the 

closure device (110) on the container (112). 
Device as claimed in one of Claims 5 or 6, characterised in that the 
retaining grooves (178; 180) in the collar ring (140) are defined by an 

upper and a lower, annular, external annular bead (176, 179). 
Device as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in that the lower end of the 
guide socket (130) on the protective cap (126) is defined by a snap bead 

(172) which is engaged by the upper annular bead (176) on the collar ring 
(140). 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the stop (62; 162) on 
the adapter (46; 146), which comprises plastics material, comprises at 

least one stop cam (62; 162), which is connected to the lower edge of the 
internal flange (52; 152) on the adapter (46; 146) between its projections 

(54; 154) by means of a film link by means of which the stop cam (62; 
162) projects in its elastically biased position beyond the cylindrical  

 
peripheral surface of the adapter (46; 146) and is constructed to be 

bendable radially inwardly into an empty space (64; 164) below the 
internal flange (52; 152) on the adapter (46; 146) in dependence on the 

chattering force which is exerted. 
Device as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the two grooves (256, 
258) on the inner surface of each projection (254) on the adapter (246) 

are arranged above one another, the first groove (256) of which, which is 
directly adjacent the internal flange (252) on the adapter (246), serves to 

receive the annular flange (248) on the pump (220) and the second 
groove (258) of which, which is arranged beneath it, serves to receive the 

flange (218) on the container throat (216).
