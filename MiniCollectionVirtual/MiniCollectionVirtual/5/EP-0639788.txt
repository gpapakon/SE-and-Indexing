<ABSTRACT>
The present invention offers a picture projecting device 
which projects a clear picture even in a bright environment 

by cutting out the influence of outside light, regardless of 
the kind of projector used. 
For example, a first polarizing film (22) is attached to 
the surface of a screen (20) inside an 

airplane. Further, a 
second polarizing film (32) is attached to 

window structure (10) in order to filter the light from outside. 
The second polarizing film (32) has the same polarizing 

property as the first polarizing film (22), but they are 
placed so that the plane of polarization of the second 

polarizing film (32) differs from that of the first polarizing 
film (22) by 90°. 
In a window structure equipped on the side walls of a 
cabin in the body of an airplane, t
he dust cover (320) 
comprises a transparent resin board (330), a non-elastic 

film (340) stuck on the surface of the transparent resin board 
facing the shade (80), and a polarizing film (350) sandwiched between the 

resin board and the non-elastic film.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a picture projecting device 
equipped in an airplane which is capable of projecting a 
clear picture in a bright environment. When showing picture to passengers in an aircraft, 
device such as video projector, is used. When doing so, the sunlight coming in from the window of 
the airplane reflected on the screen making it difficult to 
see the projected pictures, so there was a need to close the 
shades of the windows and turn out the light to make the 
cabin dark. However, the darkness of the cabin was inconvenient for 
the passengers who needed to read printed material or take a 
memo, and there was a device such as spotlight needed at 
their side. So, in Japanese Laid-open Utility Model No. 3-5147, 
there is an idea mentioned where a polarizing board having 
the same polarizing trait as that of the output portion of 
the liquid crystal panel of a liquid crystal projector is 
used as the screen so that the influence of outer light would 
be reduced. The idea taught in the Utility Model could only reduce  
 
the influence of outer light when a picture from a liquid 
crystal projector was projected to a transmitting screen. But in an airplane where a video projector is used, all 
the shades on the windows had to be shut as well as turning 
off the room light to cut off outer light when projecting a 
video, and passengers were troubled by having to shut the 
shades on the window by themselves. So, there was 
inconvenience in having to trouble even the passengers who 
did not want to see the video. Therefore, the present invention offers a picture 
projecting device which projects a clear picture even in a 
bright environment by cutting out the influence of outer 
light, regardless of the kind of projector used. The other object of this invention is to provide a 
window structure of the airplane to be used for that purpose. The picture projecting device of the present invention 
comprises of a polarizing film put onto the input portion of 
outer incident light upon the screen having a plane of 
polarization with a phase differing by 90° from that of the 
polarizing film put onto the screen for projecting pictures. 
Further, the polarizing film put onto the screen has a plane 
of polarization with the same phase as that of the projection 
light. Outer incident light from all directions are polarized 
by letting them pass through a polarizing film before 
entering the screen. The polarizing film on the screen has a 
plane of polarization differing from that on the input  
 
portion
