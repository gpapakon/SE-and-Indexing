<ABSTRACT>
Method for producing lateral bipolar transistors on SOI substrate, in which a primary doping is produced in the silicon layer of this SOI substrate for the conduction type of the emitter and collector, insulation regions (5) are produced outside the region intended for the transistor, contact layers (71, 81) and dielectric layers (72, 82) are applied and structured over a highly doped emitter zone (7) which is produced by a masking technique and a highly doped collector zone (8), so that there is a trench over a base zone (9) to be produced in the middle between the emitter zone (7) and the collector zone (8), then an auxiliary layer (11) is deposited conformally over the entire area with constant thickness (d), as a result of which the trench with width (w) is reduced to a gap with the width (x) of the base zone (9) to be produced, implantation of dopant for the sign of the conductance of the base is carried out through this gap, the regions located laterally with respect to this base zone (9) being shielded by the vertical portions of the auxiliary layer (11) which cover the sides of the trench, then contact holes are etched in the auxiliary layer (11) and the dielectric layer (72, 82) and metal contacts for electrical connection of the emitter, collector and base are produced.
