<ABSTRACT>
In areas where high thermal stresses are encountered, mineral fibers (aliminium silicate fibres, glass fibres, asbestos fibres) are used as reinforcing elements for inorganic composite materials exposed to particular mechanical stresses. The fibrous materials in use until now come increasingly into question because of environmental and health hazard aspects. This patent application shows a way of replacing such fibres by plate-like materials, preferably shale plates. Inorganic formed masses with various binders (water glass, aluminium monophosphate, cement) are thus disclosed, in which reinforcement effects similar to those obtained with mineral fibres are achieved by the use of relatively coarse layered rocks, preferably plate-like structures arranged in parallel plans. These formed masses are also suitable as fireproofing coatings.
