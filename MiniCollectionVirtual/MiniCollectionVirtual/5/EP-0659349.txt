<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns treatment of diabetes 
with myo-inositol and nutritional compositions containing 
same. Diabetes is a significant disease in humans. Although 
a complex disease, it is a characteristic of subjects having 
diabetes to have an impaired ability to remove serum or 
plasma glucose after a glucose load such as after meal 
ingestion. Such an impairment (sometimes referred to as 
"glucose intolerance") in severe cases can lead to 
significant clinical sequelae such as renal failure: Prior art methods for treating glucose intolerance 
include use of insulin or adherence to strict diets which 
limit intake of easily metabolized carbohydrates. Several 
liquid enteral formulas designed for use by diabetes 
patients are commercially available such as GlucernaÂ® 
nutritional formula (available from Ross Laboratories, 
Columbus, Ohio). One such enteral formula is described in 
U.S. Patent 4,921,877 in which a substantial amount of 
fructose is part of the carbohydrate component. Other prior art methods for treating diabetes or 
glucose intolerance include administration of inositol 
triphosphate (U.S. Patent 5,023,248) and D-chiro-inositol 
(U.S. Patent 5,124,360). Myo-inositol is known in the nutritional field to be an 
important nutritional component of the diet (see, for 
example, Holub, B. J., "The Nutritional Significance, 
Metabolism, and Function of myo-Inositol and 
Phosphatidylinositol in Health and Disease" in Adv. Nutr. 
Res. 4:107-141 (1982)). Low levels of myo-inositol are 
typically added to infant formulas and adult enteral 
nutritional formulas. In addition, administration of low 
levels of dietary inositol has been found to have certain 
other beneficial effects (see, Price, D. E., et al., "Effect  
 
of Aldose Reductase Inhibition on Nerve Conduction Velocity 
and Resistance to Ischemic Conduction Block in Experimental 
Diabetes," Diabetes, 37:969-973 (1988); Greene, D. A., et 
al., "Impaired Rat Sciatic Nerve Sodium-Potassium Adenosine 
Triphosphatase in Acute Streptozocin Diabetes and its 
Correction by Dietary Myo-Inositol Supplementation," J. 
Clin. Invest., 72:1058-1063 (1983); Knudsen, G. M., et al., 
"Myo-Inositol Normalises Decreased Sodium Permeability of 
the Blood-Brain Barrier in Streptosotocin Diabetes," 
Neuroscience, 29(3):773-777 (1989); Hallman, M., et al., 
"Inositol Supplementation in Respiratory Distress syndrome: 
Relationship Between Serum Concentration, Renal Excretion, 
and Lung Effluent Phospholipids," The Journal of Pediatrics,

glucose lowering amount of myo-inositol is about 1 to about 15 

g per 100 cal of total composition. 
The composition of Claim 2 comprising about 7% to about 
30% protein, about 20% to about 56% lipid, and about 20% to about 

70% total carbohydrate, said percentages being based on the total 
caloric value of the composition.

about 15% protein, about 35% to about 45% lipid, and about 38% 

to about 52% total carbohydrate, said percentages being based on 
the total caloric value of the composition. 
The composition of Claim 3 comprising about 12% 
protein, about 40% lipid, and about 45% total carbohydrate, said 

percentages being based on the total caloric value of the 
composition. 
The composition of Claim 1 having a dietary fiber 
content of about 0.5 to about 4 g per 100 cal of total 

composition. 
The composition of Claim 1 further comprising vitamins 
and minerals. 
The composition of Claim 6 further comprising vitamins 
and minerals. 
The composition of Claim 9 wherein the amount of 
vitamins and minerals supply 100% of the RDA in 500 to 2,000 cal 

of composition. 
The composition of Claim 10 further comprising at least 
one of the following components: chromium, selenium, molybdenum, 

carnitine, taurine, beta-carotene, one or more artificial 
sweeteners, one or more emulsifiers, or one or more stabilizers.
