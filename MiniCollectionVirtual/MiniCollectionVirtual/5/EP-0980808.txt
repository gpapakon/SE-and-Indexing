<ABSTRACT>
An interface between the end of a bolster (16) and
a side frame column (17,19) for a three-piece railcar

bogie assembly is disclosed. The bolster (16) and side
frame (12) have several pairs of facing stop surfaces at

the interface. Each pair of facing stop surfaces are at
two different spacings: one spacing is close, with a

small gap (86') between the stop surfaces; another
spacing (114) is greater than the first. The second

spacing (114) allows the side frame (12) to pitch with
respect to the bolster (16) transverse axis. The

bolster stop surfaces may be the lands inboard and
outboard of the friction shoe pockets. The lands may be

shaped so that there is a raised warp control portion or
surface (49) and one or more relief portions or surfaces

(128), the warp control portion (49) extending farther
laterally than the relief portions (128). The warp

control portion (49) is used to maintain the bogie in a
square relationship, and the more loosely spaced relief

portions (128) allow for side frame articulation as the
bogie traverses track at different elevations. The

raised warp control portions (49) and reliefs (128) may
alternatively or also be formed on the side frame lands

or wear plates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to railcar bogie assemblies and more specifically to an
arrangement of the lands or stop surfaces between the side frames and bolster of a three-piece
railcar bogie assembly.In previous railcar bogie assemblies, wide laterally-extending stop surfaces or lands
adjacent to the side frame wear plates and bolster friction shoe pockets have been provided to
avoid rotation of the bolster about is longitudinal axis, that is, bolster rotation. Bolster
antirotation stops or lugs have also been provided at the inside face of a side frame column to
inhibit rotation of the bolster in the side frame about the bolster's longitudinal axis.Railcar bogie hunting is a continuous instability of a railcar wheel set wherein the bogie
weaves down the track in an oscillatory fashion, usually with the wheel flanges striking against
the rail. A related condition known as lozenging is an unsquare condition of the side frames
and bolster, and it occurs where the side frames operationally remain parallel to each other,
but one side frame moves slightly ahead of the other in a cyclic fashion; this condition is also
referred to as parallelogramming or warping. In bogie warping, the bolster rotates about its
central vertical axis, causing angular displacement of the side frame and bolster longitudinal
axes from a normal relationship. Warping results in wheel misalignment with respect to the
track. It is more pronounced on curved track and usually provides the opportunity for a large
angle-of-attack to occur.At the same time, the track which the railcar bogie assembly traverses may change
elevation. It is necessary that the side frame be able to articulate with respect to the bolster.
Otherwise, as track irregularities are encountered, the side frame will tend to twist the bolster
and produce substantial stresses therein. To avoid these excessive stresses, the side frame
needs to be able to pitch, that is, to change its angle with respect to the bolster transverse axes.To reduce bogie warping, United States Patent Application Serial No. 08/950,178, filed
on May 2, 1997 and entitled "Improved Bolster Land Arrangement for Railcar Truck",
discloses that the free travel between the mated bolster and side frame at the side frame 
columns may be constrained. The clearance or separation gap between the bolster lands and
the side frame columns is reduced or eliminated. That patent application does not however,
address the need to allow for articulation of the side frame as the track elevations vary.The present
