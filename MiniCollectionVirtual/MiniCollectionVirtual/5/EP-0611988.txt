<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to a method of 
extracting blue, green and red exposure records from an 
imagewise exposed silver halide photographic element 
and to a photographic element particularly adapted for 
use in the method. In classical black-and-white photography a 
photographic element containing a silver halide 
emulsion layer coated on a transparent film support is 
imagewise exposed to light, producing a latent image 
within the emulsion layer. The film is then 
photographically processed to transform the latent 
image into a silver image that is a negative image of 
the subject photographed. Photographic processing 
involves developing (reducing silver halide grains 
containing latent image sites to silver), stopping 
development, and fixing (dissolving undeveloped silver 
halide grains). The resulting processed photographic 
element, commonly referred to as a negative, is placed 
between a uniform exposure light source and a second 
photographic element, commonly referred to as a 
photographic paper, containing a silver halide emulsion 
layer coated on a white paper support. Exposure of the 
emulsion layer of the photographic paper through the 
negative produces a latent image in the photographic 
paper that is a positive image of the subject 
originally photographed. Photographic processing of 
the photographic paper produces a positive silver 
image. The image bearing photographic paper is 
commonly referred to as a print.  In classical color photography in its most 
widely used form the photographic film contains three 
superimposed silver halide emulsion layer units each 
containing a different subtractive primary dye or dye 
precursor, one for recording blue light (i.e., blue) 
exposure and forming a yellow dye image, one for 
recording green exposure and forming a magenta dye 
image, and one for recording red exposure and forming a 
cyan dye image. During photographic processing 
developing agent is oxidized in the course of reducing 
latent image containing silver halide grains to silver, 
and the oxidized developing agent is employed to form 
the dye image, usually by reacting (coupling) with a 
dye precursor (a dye-forming coupler). Undeveloped 
silver halide is removed by fixing and the unwanted 
developed silver image is removed by bleaching during 
photographic processing. This approach is most 
commonly used to produce negative dye images (i.e., 
blue, green and red subject features appear yellow, 
magenta and cyan, respectively). Exposure of color 
paper through the color
