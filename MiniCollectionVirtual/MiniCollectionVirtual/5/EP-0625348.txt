<ABSTRACT>
A transfer trolley 3 for transferring a patient onto an operating table 1 has a removable 
patient support platform 4 divided across its length into two parts 40 and 41 coupled by a 

hinge 42. A rod 46 and cylinder 47 mounted at their ends to respective parts of the platform 
are lockable to lock the two parts of the platform and prevent bending at the hinge while on 

the trolley. The trolley has two arms 28, 78 for supporting the platform, which either extend 
laterally under the platform on opposite sides of the hinge or longitudinally and traversing the 

region of the hinge. A control unit 32 on the trolley 3 has infra-red emitters 33 that emit 
signals to sensors 51 on the table 1, to control operation of the table, only when the trolley is 

correctly located for transfer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transfer trolleys of the kind for use in transferring a patient 
onto an operating table, the trolley including a removable patient support platform divided 
across its length into two parts coupled at a hinge, the platform being lockable to prevent 
bending at the hinge while on the trolley. Such a trolley is known from FR-A-1.322.712. Instead of lifting a patient off a trolley and onto an operating table, it is common 
practice for the top, or patient support platform, of the trolley to be removable so that this can 
be transferred onto the operating table support column. The platform is then used to support 
the patient during surgery and is articulated and displaceable by means of the operating table 
controls. After surgery, the patient support platform is moved back onto the trolley so that 
the patient can be transferred to the recovery room. This arrangement minimizes disturbance 
of the patient and reduces the amount of lifting that needs to be done by theatre staff. The patient support platform is usually supported by the trolley and the operating 
table at the hinge point of the platform, that is, the point at which the two ends of the platform 
form an acute or obtuse angle when the ends are raised or lowered relative to one another. 
One problem with this arrangement is that different platforms are needed for side loading and 
for end loading. Another problem with these transfer systems is in controlling the loading and 
unloading operations. It is possible in some systems for the user to start loading or unloading 
of the table before the trolley is in the correct position. This can lead to damage or injury.  
 It is an object of the present invention in its various objects to provide an improved 
operating table, trolley and transfer system. According to the present invention there is provided a transfer trolley of the above-specified 
kind, characterised in that the trolley includes supports for supporting the platform 
at locations spaced along the platform on opposite sides of the hinge, characterised in that the 
trolley includes a control unit supplying signals to an operating table to control operation of 
the operating table. The control unit is preferably arranged so that signals are only received by the 
operating table when the trolley is in the correct position to transfer the patient support 
platform to or from the operating table. The control unit may include an infrared emitter 
arranged to supply signals to an infrared sensor on the operating

includes supports (28, 78) for supporting the platform at locations spaced along 
the platform on opposite sides of the hinge, and in that the trolley (3) 

includes a control unit (32) supplying signals to an operating table (1) to 
control operation of the operating table. 
A trolley according to Claim 1, characterised in that the control unit (32) is 
arranged so that signals are only received by the operating table (1) when the 

trolley is in the correct position to transfer the patient support platform (4) to or 
from the operating table. 
A trolley according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the control unit (32) 
includes an infrared emitter (33) arranged to supply signals to an infra-red 

sensor (51) on the operating table (1). 
A trolley according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
platform includes a rod (46) and cylinder (47) mounted at their ends to 

respective parts (40, 41) of the platform, and that the rod is slidable in the 
cylinder and is lockable relative to the cylinder.
