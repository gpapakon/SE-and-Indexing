<ABSTRACT>
It provides a process to form on a certain conductive type 
semiconductor substrate 1 insulation layer 9 having openings 11, 

which regions will become source and drain; a process to form 
diffusion layer 8 of the same conductive type as semiconductor 

substrate 1 in to-be-drain space, with insulation layer 9 and 
photoresist 10 as masks; a process to form side wall layer 13 

alongside openings of insulation layer 9; a process to form 
diffusion layers 4 and 5, conductive type of which layers is 

opposite to that of semiconductor substrate 1, in to-be-source 
and to-be-drain regions, with insulation layer 9 and side wall 

layer 13 as masks; a process to remove insulation layer 9 and 
side wall layer 13; and a process to form insulation layer 2 on 

semiconductor substrate in channel region distinguished by, and 
including part of, diffusion layers 4 and 5, and to form floating-gate 

electrode 3 on insulation layer 2, and control-gate 
electrode 7 on floating-gate electrode 3 with insulation layer 6 

in between. 
The manufacturing method according to this invention forms 
drain and high density P-type diffusion layer by making use of 

side wall layer. Therefore, this makes it possible to shape DSA 
structure controlling the distance from drain to high density 

P-type diffusion layer with high accuracy, without using high 
temperature diffusion process. This means that this invention 

offers an easy way to make DSA structure with finer design rules.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to manufacturing method of 
electrically programable/erasable floating-gate semiconductor 
memory devices. One of the well-known electrically programable/erasable non-volatile 
memory devices is non-volatile memory transistor made of 
stacked-gate field-effect transistor, wherein programing is 
conducted by means of hot electron mechanism, and erasing by 
Fowler-Nordheim tunneling mechanism. In the stacked-gate non-volatile 
memory transistor, hot electron generated in diffusion 
layer is implanted in floating-gate electrode to change electric 
charge of floating-gate electrode. Thus, threshold voltage of 
transistor is changed, and information recorded. Typical 
construction of above mentioned stacked-gate non-volatile memory 
transistors is as shown in FIG. 6 by its cross-sectional view. 
Referring to FIG. 6, thin silicon oxide layer 2, which is 
tunneling medium, is formed on P-type silicon substrate 1. On 
silicon oxide layer 2 is floating-gate electrode 3. In silicon 
substrate, there are N-type diffusion layers, viz., source 4 and 
drain 5. On top of floating-gate electrode 3, control-gate 
electrode is formed with silicon oxide layer 6 in between. Recently, however, in order to increase programing speed of  
 
stacked-gate non-volatile memory transistor a new memory cell 
having DSA (Diffusion Self Align) structure as shown in FIG. 7 is 
proposed. In DSA structure, P-type (being the same conductive 
type as substrate) impurity layer is formed by means of ion-implantation 
to drain in self-aligning manner; in this way the 
impurity density of substrate at drain edge is enhanced to help 
easier occurrence of electric field concentration, thus the 
efficiency of hot electron generating is increased. Referring to 
FIG. 7, 1 indicates P-type silicon substrate, 4 source, 5 N-type 
diffusion layer, or drain region, 8 high density P-type diffusion 
layer that has been formed to the drain in self-aligning manner, 
2 thin silicon oxide layer, or tunneling medium, 3 floating-gate 
electrode, 6 silicon oxide layer, or insulation layer, and 7 
control-gate electrode. FIG. 8 shows prior art manufacturing 
method of DSA structure as shown in FIG. 7. First, as shown in 
FIG. 8(a), form silicon oxide layer 9 on P-type semiconductor 
substrate 1 providing openings for regions of source 4 and drain 
5, and then apply photoresist mask 10 to cover source region 4. 
Next, as shown in FIG. 8(b), Boron ion-implantation using silicon 
oxide layer 9 and photoresist mask 10 as masks, to form high 
den
