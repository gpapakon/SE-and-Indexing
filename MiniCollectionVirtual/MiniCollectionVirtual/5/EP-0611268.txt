<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an apparatus for guiding the 
transverse position of a fabric in a paper machine, 

such as a drying wire (10), a press felt (20), or of 
an equivalent fabric. The guide apparatus comprises 

an alignment roll (60) for the fabric (10,20), the 
axial alignment of said alignment roll being regulated 

by means of the guide apparatus. In the guide 
apparatus, a sledge (64) is fitted in connection with 

one or both of the bearing supports (63) of the alignment 
roll (60), the position of said sledge in relation 

to the frame part (62) of the apparatus being regulated 
by means of an actuator motor (61). The 

sledge (64) of the guide apparatus is fitted on linear 
guides (72,74) in the frame part (62) of the apparatus, 

being guided by said guides. The apparatus 
comprises a self-holding power transmission arrangement 

(65,70), which is operated by the actuator 
motor (61) of the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns an apparatus for guiding the transverse position of a fabric
in a paper machine, according to the preamble of claim 1, which is based on US-A-2 484 473.The prior-art wire guide apparatuses that are commonly used comprise a pneumatic
bellows device, which is fitted in connection with a bearing support of the alignment
roll so that the axial alignment of the alignment roll can be altered, whereby the
transverse position of the fabric can be regulated. In this respect, regarding the prior
art related to the present invention, reference is made to the applicant's FI Patent No.
77,434 (equivalent to US Patent 4,932,578).It is a drawback of the prior-art bellows devices and equivalent that the height of the
apparatus is quite large, as well as that it is difficult to make the apparatus rigid
enough, which results in problems of vibration. It is a further drawback that, for
example, in the event of failure in the supply of electricity or of other disturbance,
the pressure is lost in the bellows, in which case the apparatus is usually shifted to
one of its extreme positions, as a result of which the fabric guided by the apparatus
is guided to the side and is, as a rule, destroyed completely.It is also a drawback of the prior-art apparatuses for guiding a drying wire that the
pneumatic bellows of the actuator have poor resistance to the temperatures present in
the dryer section. It is a further drawback in the prior-art apparatuses that the position of their location
is usually limited, because the guides of the displaceable sledge of the guiding
apparatus, to which sledge the bearing support of the alignment roll is attached, can
be loaded in certain directions only.It may also be considered a drawback in the prior-art apparatuses that there is a
considerable distance between the guides of said sledge and the area of action of the
bellows devices, which produces a torsion in the guides of the sledge, with resulting
detrimentally high friction forces, which make precise adjustment of the position
more difficult.The object of the present invention is to avoid the drawbacks that came out above and
to provide a novel guiding apparatus with a more rigid construction, so that the problems
of vibration can be largely avoided.It is a further object of the invention to provide an apparatus whose construction is
self-holding, so that, for example, in the event of failure in the supply of electricity
or some other disturbance, it is locked in its latest position, in which case the fabric
guided by

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for guiding the transverse position of a fabric in a paper machine, such
as a drying wire (10), a press felt (20), or of an equivalent fabric, comprising an

alignment roll (60) for the fabric (10,20), the axial alignment of said alignment roll
being regulated by means of the guide apparatus, and which guide apparatus comprises

a sledge (64) or equivalent fitted in connection with one or both of the bearing
supports (63) of the alignment roll (60), the position of said sledge or equivalent in

relation to the frame part (62) of the apparatus being regulated by means of an
actuator motor (61), and said sledge (64) or equivalent of

the guide apparatus being fitted on and guided by linear guides (72,74) in the frame part (62) of the
apparatus said linear guides (72,74) having been arranged so that they can be loaded in all directions

transverse to the direction of movement (A), the apparatus further comprising a self-holding
power transmission arrangement (65,70), which is operated by said actuator

motor (61) and which comprises a shifting-screw-nut
combination (65,70), whose shifting screw (65) is journalled (71a,71b) on the frame

part (62) of the apparatus, and at which shifting screw, the nut (70) placed on the
outer thread of said screw is connected with the sledge (64) of the guiding apparatus characterized in that

the linear guides comprise at least two linear guide rails (72) and at least two linear
ball-bearing units (74) placed in connection with each of said rails (72), and that the

shifting screw (65,65k) and the shifting nut (70,70k) of the apparatus are placed
substantially symmetrically between said linear guide rails (72) substantially in their

support plane (K-K). 
Guiding apparatus as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized

in that the shifting screw is a screw (65) which is provided with a self-holding square
thread and on whose outer thread (65k) a shifting nut (70) is fitted, which is provided

with a corresponding inner square thread (70k) and which is connected with said
sledge (64).
Guiding apparatus as claimed in any of the claims 1 and 2, 
characterized

in that the shifting screw of the guiding apparatus is a ball screw, which is not self-holding,
and that the locking of the sledge (64) of the guiding apparatus is arranged

by means of the drive gear (67) of the shifting screw (65) and/or by means of a brake
motor.
Guiding apparatus as claimed in any of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized

in that, between the frame part (62) of the guiding device and both ends of the sledge
(64) that is displaced in its connection, there are limiter devices (68), which are

provided with a spring and by whose means the range of movement of the sledge
(64) is limited.
Guiding apparatus as claimed in any of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized

in that the guiding apparatus is substantially symmetric in relation to the central plane
(T-T) perpendicular to the support plane (K-K) of the linear guide rails, which central

plane (T-T) is further placed on the central axis of the shifting screw (65) (Fig. 7).
