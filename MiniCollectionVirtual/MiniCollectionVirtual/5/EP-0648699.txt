<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and method 
(10)
 for controlling the 
tension and stopping action of web material fed from a 

supply roll 
(S)
 is disclosed. A supply roll of web material 
is supported on a support assembly 
(14)
. A brake 
(26)
 is 
operatively connected to the support assembly 
(14)
 for 
applying a braking force onto the support assembly to apply 

tension onto the withdrawn web material. The diameter of 
the supply roll is sensed 
(32)
 and a signal is generated to 
the power supply 
(30)
 of a brake proportional to the 
diameter of the supply roll to vary the applied braking 

force and maintain a constant tension on the web material 
during its withdrawal. A stopping signal is generated to 

the brake power supply during stopping operation of film 
withdrawal to increase the braking force supplied to the 

support assembly. The stopping signal is an additive 
combination of a first signal that is essentially 

proportional to the diameter of the supply roll and a second 
signal that is essentially constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for 
controlling the tension and stopping action of web material 
fed from a web supply roll positioned on a support assembly 
where a stop signal is generated to a brake during stopping 
operation of web withdrawal to increase the braking force 
supplied to the support assembly and prevent overrunning of 
the supply roll.  
 US-A-3 862 723 discloses a system, 
namely an apparatus and a method according to the preambles of 
Claims 1 and 7, 
for controlling a motor in 
such a way that the linear velocity of a wire wound on a 
drum is maintained substantially constant. WO-A-9 107 341 
discloses an apparatus for enabling material to drawn off a 
roll in a direction of withdrawal at an optimum tension, 
wherein the rotation of a spindle is controlled by measuring 
an angular displacement and controlling a brake dependent on 
said measurement. US-A-4 773 610 discloses a vertical axis 
coil stock feed apparatus having an improved arrangement for 
controlling movement of the outer winding at the upper end 
of coils or coil stacks of a widely different height. EP-A-0 
458 465 discloses a magnetic braking apparatus with a load 
detecting means being capable of easily measuring the 
breaking torque or load.  
 In high speed bottle labeling, paper manufacturing, and 
other similar industries where a web of thin material such 
as polymer film or paper is withdrawn from a rotatably 
mounted supply roll, a braking force is typically applied 
onto the assembly supporting the supply roll to ensure that 
uniform tension is maintained on the withdrawn web material 
as it is processed. These supply rolls have high inertia 
which varies as the roll unwinds and its diameter decreases. The amount of braking force applied onto the support 
assembly is usually varied depending on the diameter of the 
roll and its inertia to maintain constant web tension. 
During acceleration and deceleration of the supply roll, the 
braking force on the support assembly must change to 
maintain the desired web tension and prevent either film 
breakage caused by excess back tension or prevent 
overrunning of the web feed caused by a lack of proper 
tension. Deceleration to a rapid stop position is also 
difficult because the supply roll can overrun when no 
additional braking force is applied to compensate for such 
rapid deceleration. As a result, during rapid supply roll 
slowdowns into a stop position, additional braking force 
must be applied onto the support assembly to prevent 
overruns.
