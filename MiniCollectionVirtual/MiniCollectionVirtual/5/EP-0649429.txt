<ABSTRACT>
Oligonucleotide-mimicking macromolecules that have improved nuclease resistance are provided. Replacement of the normal phosphorodiester inter-sugar linkages found in natural oligonucleotides with three or four atom linking groups provide unique oligonucleotide-mimicking macromolecules that are useful in regulating RNA expression and in therapeutics. Methods of synthesis and use also are disclosed.

iHETEROATOMIC OLIGONϋCLEOSIDE LINKAGESCROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONSThis application is a continuation in part of the PCT Application filed May 21, 1992 entitled "Backbone Modified 5 Oligonucleotide Analogues", which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 703,619 filed May 21, 1991, which is a continu- ation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 566,836 filed August 13, 1990 and of U.S. Serial No. 558,663 filed July 27, 1990, all of which are assigned to the assignee of this application and all 10 of which are incorporated by reference herein.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the design, synthesis and application of nuclease resistant macromolecules that function as oligonucleotide mimics and are useful for therapeutics,15 diagnostics and as research reagents. The macromolecules have modified linkages in place of the phosphorodiester inter-sugar linkages found in wild type nucleic acids. The macromolecules are resistant to nuclease degradation and are capable of modulating the activity of DNA and RNA. Methods fo20 synthesizing the macromolecules and for modulating th production of proteins, utilizing the macromolecules of th invention are also provided. Further provided are intermediat compositions useful in the synthesis of the macromolecules.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION25 It is well known that most of the bodily states i 

mammals, including most disease states, are effected b proteins. Such proteins, acting either directly or throug their enzymatic functions, contribute in major proportion t many diseases in animals and man. Classical therapeutics has generally focused upo interactions with such proteins in an effort to moderate thei disease causing or disease potentiating functions. Recently, however, attempts have been made to moderate the actua production of such proteins by interactions with the molecules, i.e., intracellular RNA, that direct their synthesis. Thes interactions have involved the hybridization of complementar "antisense" oligonucleotides or certain analogs thereof to RNA. Hybridization is the sequence-specific hydrogen bonding o oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide analogs to RNA or singl stranded DNA. By interfering with the production of proteins, it has been hoped to effect therapeutic results with maximu effect and minimal side effects. In the same way, oligonucleo tide like macromolecules may modulate the production o proteins by an organism. The pharmacological activity of antisense oligonuc leotides and oligonucleotide analogs, like other therapeutics depends
