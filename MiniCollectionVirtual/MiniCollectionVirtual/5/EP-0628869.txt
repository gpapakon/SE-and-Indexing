<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a diffusion transfer 
heat-developable color photographic light-sensitive material 

comprising a suppot having thereon at least one light-sensitive 
silver halide emulsion layer and a nondiffusing dye-providing 

compound which releases or forms a diffusive dye in response to 
or in counter response to a reaction by which a silver halide 

is reduced to silver under the presence of a reducing agent, 
and an organic solid pigment in at least one of light-sensitive 

silver halide emulsion layer and the layer(s) adjacent thereto, 
and a method for forming a color image using the light-sensitive 

material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diffusion transfer
heat-developable color photographic light-sensitive material
and a process for the formation of a color image on such a
heat-developable color photographic light-sensitive material
and more particularly to a diffusion transfer heat-developable
color photographic light-sensitive material having an improved
color reproducibility and a process for the formation of a
color image on such a heat-developable color photographic
light-sensitive material.A diffusion transfer heat-developable photographic
light-sensitive material is known in this field. For the heat-developable
photographic light-sensitive material and its
processing method, reference can be made, for example, to
Shashin Kogaku no Kiso (Base of Photographic Engineering),
Edition of Nonsilver Photography, pp. 242 - 255; Corona, 1982.Also, many methods for obtaining a color image by heat
development have been proposed. For example, U.S. Patents
3,531,286, 3,761,270 and 4,021,240, Belgian Patent 802,519,
Research Disclosure (hereinafter abbreviated as "RD"),
September 1975, pp. 31 - 32, etc. propose a method for forming 
a color image by the combination of an oxidized product of a
developing agent and a coupler.However, since the foregoing heat-developable
photographic light-sensitive material on which a color image is
formed is of nonfixable type, silver halide remains even after
the formation of an image, causing a serious problem of
coloring on the white ground when exposed to strong light or
after prolonged storage. Further, the foregoing methods are
disadvantageous in that they normally require a relatively long
period of time for development and the resulting image exhibits
a significant fog and a low density.In order to overcome these difficulties, an approach
has been proposed which comprises imagewise forming or
releasing a diffusive dye by heating, and then transferring the
diffusive dye to an image-receiving material having a mordant
with a solvent such as water (see U.S. Patents 4,500,626,
4,483,914, 4,503,137, and 4,559,920, and JP-A-59-165054 (The
term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined published
Japanese patent application")).In the foregoing approach, a high development
temperature is still required, and the preservability of the
photographic light-sensitive material is still insufficient.
Accordingly, an approach is disclosed which comprises heat
development of a photographic light-sensitive material in the
presence of a base or base precursor and a slight amount of
water,
