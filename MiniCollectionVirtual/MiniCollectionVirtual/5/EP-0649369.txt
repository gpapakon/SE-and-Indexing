<ABSTRACT>
A plant for the separation at high temperatures of contaminants (B) from plastic material (A) in small pieces or in leaves, comprising at least one stage (2) for the separation of contaminants (B), which in turn comprises a centrifugal separator device (8) designed to separate an input flow (A + B + C) consisting of plastic material (A) in small pieces or in leaves, with contaminants (B) and a conveying fluid comprising water and steam (C), into a mai n flow (A + C) of said material and said conveying fluid and into a secondary flow (B + C) of said contaminants and said conveying fluid. Said separation stage (2) comprises, moreover, a cyclone (9) designed to receive in input said secondary flow and to divide it into a discharge flow af said contaminants and water (B + C') and into a flow of steam (C") which is conveyed towards the inlet (18) of the separation device (8) of the same stage (2) and/or of the previous stages. Moreover a final cyclone (3) is preferably provided, connected in cascade to all the possible stages of separation (2) of the plant (1) to receive in input the main flow (A + C) in output at the final stage (2) and separate it in turn into a flow of material and water (A + C') conveyed to the outside of the plant, and into a flow of steam (C') conveyed towards the inlet (18) of the separation device (8) of at least one of the stages (2) which precede it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plant for the separation 
at high temperatures of contaminants of various types from 
plastic material in small pieces or in leaves. Such a processing plant 
is known from FR-A-2 293 522. This is a need which is particularly felt during processes 
for the recycling of plastic: said material must in fact be 
freed of different contaminants such as for example paper, 
glue, wood and, more generally, various types of fibres. The existence of a centrifugal dryer is also known as being 
particularly suitable for plastic material in small pieces 
previously washed. This dryer has been described in IT-A-2 037 181. It has also been seen that said dryer can be used as a 
device for separating contaminants from plastic material in 
small pieces or leaves. This operation is rendered particularly effective if 
performed at high temperatures using water and steam, with 
chemical additives if required, as a fluid for conveying the 
material along the plant. The use of steam as a component of said conveying fluid 
however entails high costs both in energy terms and in terms of 
equipment for producing the steam itself. The main object of the invention is therefore to provide a 
plant for the separation at high temperatures of contaminants 
from plastic material in small pieces or leaves which uses a 
centrifugal separation device such as the one mentioned above  
 
and functioning with a conveying fluid consisting of water and 
steam in which the use of steam does not entail costs which are 
too high both in energy terms and in terms of equipment for the 
production of steam. In accordance with the invention said object is achieved by 
means of a separation plant characterised in that it comprises 
at least one stage for the separation of contaminants which 
comprises, in turn, a centrifugal separator device designed to 
separate an input flow consisting of plastic material in small 
pieces or leaves, with contaminants, and a conveying fluid 
comprising water and steam, into a main flow of said material 
and said conveying fluid and into a secondary flow of said 
contaminants and said conveying fluid, and a cyclone designed 
to receive in input said secondary flow and to divide it into a 
discharge flow of said contaminants and water and into a flow 
of steam which is conveyed towards the inlet of the separation 
device of the same stage and/or of previous stages. Moreover a final cyclone is preferably provided, connected 
in cascade to all the possible separation stages of the plant

Plant for the separation at high temperatures of 
contaminants (B) from plastic material (A) in small pieces or 

leaves, comprising at least one stage 
(2) for the separation of contaminants (B) which comprises, in 

turn, a centrifugal separator device (8) designed to separate an input 
flow (
A + B + C
) consisting of plastic material (A) in 
small pieces or leaves, contaminants (B) and a conveying 

fluid comprising water and steam (C) into a main flow (A + C) 
of said material and said conveying fluid and into a secondary 

flow (B + C) of said contaminants and of said conveying fluid, 
characterized by further comprising 

a cyclone (9) designed to receive said secondary 
flow and to divide it into a discharge flow of said 

contaminants and water (B + C') and into a flow of steam (C'') 
which is convey
ed towards the inlet (18) of the separation 
device (8) of the same stage (2) and/or of previous stages. 
Plant according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
cyclone (3) is provided, connected in cascade to the final 

stage (2) of separation of said plant, for dividing said main 
flow (A + C) into a flow of material and water carried outside 

(A + C') of the plant itself, and into a flow of steam (C'') 
conveyed towards the inlet (18) of the separation device (8) of 

at least one of the preceding stages. 
Plant according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
device (8) for the separation of the material of each of said 

stages (2) comprises a rotor (10) designed to receive from 
above (18) said input flow of material, contaminants and 

conveying fluid (
A + B + C
) and to centrifuge it, a first 
scroll (19) developing around said rotor (10) to receive and 

convey towards a next stage (2) or towards the outlet (3) of  
 

the plant said material and said conveying fluid (A + C), a 
perforated grating (24) provided in a portion of lateral wall 

(22) of said first scroll in a position to receive the impact 
of the material centrifuged by the rotor (10) and to allow the 

flowing-out of part of said conveying fluid together with the 
contaminants (B + C) which separate from said material due to 

said impact or the crossing of the material by said conveying 
fluid, and a second scroll (26) developing around said portion 

of the first to receive and convey towards a cyclone (9) said 
part of conveying fluid and of said contaminants.
