<ABSTRACT>
Method for manufacturing an extrusion profile comprising 
simultaneously conveying a number of, in the circumferential 

direction of the profile distributed streams of material of 
at least two different compositions to a moulding-nozzle (2) and 

of making these streams flow together in the moulding-nozzle (2). 
At least one of the streams is turned on and/or off 

in a controlled manner and the combined stream of materials 
is allowed to cool off to form an extrusion profile (3). 

The catheter is a tube-like extrusion profile, containing at 
least one section the wall of which comprises bands of 

material of different composition, extending in lengthwise 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present application relates to a method for 
manufacturing a medical device, specifically for internal 
use, such as a catheter, according to the preamble of 
claim 1, with variable mechanical properties along the 
length thereof, such as a varying degree of stiffness. Such a process for manufacturing a catheter is 
known from US-A-4276250, where different streams of 
material are turned on during the extrusion process, so 
that the extrusion profile is longitudinally made up of 
sections of varying composition. The object of the invention is to improve a 
method of the type as described in US-A-4276250. According to the invention this can be achieved 
with the measures described in the characterising part of 
claim 1. The extrusion profile manufactured in accordance 
with the method according to the invention in cross 
section has areas of materials of different composition. 
Along the length of the profile the overall surface area 
of each of the different types of material may vary and 
consequently the properties of the extrusion profile will 
vary. Other embodiments of medical devices according 
to the present invention include stents, tubes for introduction 
of catheters or the like. In the European patent application no. EP-A-0448886 
catheters are described, which are composed of a 
number of materials distributed evenly in the circumferential 
direction the catheter. This publication 
relates to the materials to be used in manufacture of  
 
these catheters, where a method for manufacturing these 
catheters is not disclosed. Furthermore catheters 
described in this publication do not have varying 
mechanical properties in axial direction thereof.  
 A simple and effective embodiment of the process 
is achieved with the measure as set out in claim 2. The process of the invention together with the 
preferred measure as set out in claim 3 is especially useful 
for the manufacture of catheters such as catheters used for 
angiographic purposes. Such catheters should be pliable, ie 
of limited stiffness at the distal end in order to easily 
follow the course of a blood vessel. More towards the 
proximal end such a catheter is preferably stiffer in order 
to convey the pressure, exerted on the catheter on 
insertion, to its distal end.  
 A material which displays a greater stiffness than 
the other materials used could for instance be a solid 
material such as a fibre bundle. A fibre bundle can easily 
be incorporated in the extrusion profile during the 
extrusion process. One could start the

Method for manufacturing a medical device, 
specifically for internal use, such as a catheter, formed 

by a tube-like extrusion profile (3) with an annular 
cross section and varying mechanical properties in axial 

direction thereof, comprising: 

simultaneously conveying a number of divided streams 
(9,10) of material of at least two different compositions 

to a moulding nozzle (2), wherein the streams of material 
(9) of the same composition supplied alternating with 

those (10) of another composition, 
making these streams (9,10) flow together in the 
moulding nozzle (2) whereby at least one of the streams 

(9,10) can be turned on and/or off in a controlled manner 
during the extrusion method, and 
allowing the combined stream of materials to cool off 
into an extrusion profile,
characterised in that
 - the streams (9,10) of material to 
be conveyed to the moulding nozzle (2) are divided in the 

circumferential direction of the profile, and 
in that the streams (9,10) of material of the same 
composition are distributed evenly in the circumferential 

direction. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the 
streams (9, 10) which are turned on and/or off in a 

controlled manner are streams (9, 10) of material of the 
same composition. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein 
the compo
sitions of the materials differ in such way that 
the stiffness of those materials is different in the 

cooled off state.  
 
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein 
at least one of the streams (9, 10) is a stream of solid 

material such as a fibre bundle. 
Method according to any of the claims 1, 2 
or 3, wherein all streams (9, 10) are streams of molten 

material.

Catheter as claimed in claim 6, wherein the 
cross-section of at least two adjoining bands (16) varies 

inversely in longitudinal direction. 
Catheter as claimed in claim 7, wherein the 
bands (16) comprise materials of different stiffness and 

wherein the total cross-section of the bands (16) made of 
the stiffer material is smaller in the distal end-section 

of the catheter than in the remaining part. 
Catheter as claimed in claim 8, wherein the 
cross-section and/or the number of bands (16) made of the 

stiffer material decreases from the proximal to the 
distal end.
