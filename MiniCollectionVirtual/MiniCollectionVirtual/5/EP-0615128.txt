<ABSTRACT>
The sandwich type testing method for the determination of 
an antigen or antibody in a test sample in which the test 

sample suspected of containing the antigen or antibody is 
placed in contact with a solid substrate having an 

antibody, antigen respectively bound to it's surface 
which can form an immunocomplex with the said antigen or 

antibody respectively and in which the formation of the 
complex is detected by the addition of a marked antigen 

or antibody respectively, is characterised in that the 
solid substrate is placed in contact simultaneously with 

the test sample and with the marked antibody or antigen 
respectively. 
 
The method is particularly advantageous for the 
determination of environmental allergens and antibodies 

created by infectious and parasitic diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of testing for 
determining an antigen or antibody in a test sample and 
to equipment for carrying out the test. More particularly the invention relates to a sandwich 
type method in which the test sample suspected of 
containing particular antigens or antibodies is placed in 
contact with a solid substrate having an antibody or 
antigen bound to its surface which can form an 
immunocomplex with the antigen or antibody in the test 
sample and in which the immunocomplex which may have 
formed is detected with the use of a marked 
antibody/antigen as a detector. EP-A-0 296 398 discloses a one-step immunoassay method to 
detect the presence of antibodies (or antigens), wherein the 
antigens are blotted onto a solid substrate, and detecting 
reagent and a serum as a source of antibodies are added, and 
all three of these components incubated together. EP-A-0 498 124 discloses, in particular, an immunoassay 
for detecting DERF II, which is a major allergen of a house 
dust mite, wherein a sample, in the form of an extract, is 
incubated with a monoclonal antibody selectively recognizing 
DERF II. WO-A-92 01051 discloses a process of diagnosis in vitro 
of human or animal hydatidose comprising putting into contact 
biological material with immunogen peptide sequences directed 
against monoclonal antibodies. The invention provides, in particular, a rapid testing 
method which can be carried out easily even by non-expert 
operators and enables the response to be displayed 
directly while at the same time having a high degree of 
sensitivity. To this end, the subject of the invention is a method of 
testing of the type specified above, characterised in 
that the solid substrate is placed in contact 
simultaneously with the test sample and with the marked 
antibody or antigen.  
  
 The term "simultaneously" as used in the paragraph above 
is intended to indicate the following procedures: 
premixing of the test sample and the marked antibody 
or antigen and contact of the premixed product with the 
substrate; addition of the test sample to the substrate and 
immediate addition of the marked antibody or antigen 
without intermediate washing stages. In the preferred embodiment, the detector antibody or 
antigen is constituted by an antibody or antigen 
conjugated with a colloidal dye. Although the method of the invention is of general 
application, in view of the objects it is intended to 
achieve, it is particularly suitable and advantageous for 
the determination of
