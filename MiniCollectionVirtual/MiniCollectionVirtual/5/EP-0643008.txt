<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a manual chain block having 
a hand wheel (8) and a brake ratchet wheel (24), one of 

which is provided with a cover portion (15;30) extending 
toward the other thereof and having a circular peripheral 

surface (30a) which covers the lining plate, and the other 
of the hand wheel and the brake ratchet wheel is provided 

with a circular opposite peripheral surface (30b) opposed 
to the circular peripheral surface, so that the opposite 

peripheral surfaces of those circular peripheral surface 
can be arranged adjacently to each other or have a sealing 

member (50:52) interposed therebetween. Therefore, even 
when dust and rainwater enter a wheel cover for a hand 

wheel, this dust and rainwater can be prevented from 
further entering the mechanical brake.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manual chain block
which is provided with a drive member having a hand wheel
and a mechanical brake and is adapted to drive a load sheave
through the mechanical brake by an operation of the hand
wheel.In a conventional manual chain block, for example as
disclosed in the Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Sho.
62 (1987) - 16477, a load sheave is rotatably supported
between a pair of side plates. a drive shaft is inserted
into a central shaft portion of the load sheave, a hand
wheel is threadably secured to an axial one side portion of
the drive shaft, a mechanical brake is interposed between
the hand wheel and the drive shaft and a reduction gear
mechanism is disposed in the axial other side portion of the
drive shaft, such that when the hand wheel is operated, the
drive shaft is driven through the mechanical brake and the
load sheave is driven through the reduction gear mechanism.Further, a hook is disposed between the side plates, a
wheel cover for covering the mechanical brake and the hand
wheel is attached to one of the side plates and a gear cover
for covering the reduction gear mechanism is attached to the
other side plate. The manual chain block having the above-mentioned
structure is used not only inside of a building such as a
factory but also outdoors, for example at a building site.
Though the manual chain block is provided with the wheel
cover for covering the mechanical brake and the hand wheel,
a chain introducing opening through which a hand chain
looped around the hand wheel passes is opened in a side wall
of the wheel cover.Accordingly, when the manual chain block is used
outdoors, rainwater enters an interior of the wheel cover
through the chain introducing opening during a rainy weather
working. Further, when the manual chain block is used at a
fine weather day or inside of the building, especially
within a dusty atmosphere, dust such as fine sand grains
enter the wheel cover through the chain introducing
opening.When the rainwater and the dust enter the wheel cover as
mentioned above, they come to be interposed between lining
plates constituting the mechanical brake, namely a lining
plate interposed between the hand wheel and a brake ratchet
wheel and a lining plate interposed between the brake
ratchet wheel and a driven member, and respective braking
surfaces of the hand wheel, the ratchet wheel and the driven
member to which those lining plates are opposed, so that
comes out such a problem that a braking performance and a
brake releasing
