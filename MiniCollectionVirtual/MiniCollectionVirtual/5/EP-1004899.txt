<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to nuclear physics, medicine and oil industry, namely to
scintillating materials, and is meant for:
registration and measurement of an x - ray, gamma and alpha radiation; control for trans uranium
radio nuclides in the habitat of a man (in particular, in the zones of Chernobyl catastrophe);
sparing (non-destructive) control of the structure of hard bodies; three dimensional positron -
electron computer tomography and x - ray computer fluorography without the use of photo films;
as well as for the control of the level of liquid in oil reservoirs.Known is the material of lutetium oxyorthosilicate with cerium LU2(1-x) Ce2x SiO5 where x is
varying in the range from 2x10-4 to 3x10-2 (Patent US 4,958,080 : date of Patent Sept. 18, 1990,
"Lutetium orthosilicate single crystal Scintillator detector", Inventor C.I. Melcher, W. Redding
Assignee: Schlumberger Technology Corp., as well as Victorov L.V., Skorikov V.M., Zhukov
V.M., Shulgin B.V. "Inorganic scintillating materials", Published by the Academy of Sciences of
the USSR, series Inorganic materials, volume 27, N 10, pages 2005-2029, 1991). These
scintillating crystals Lu2(1-x) Ce2x SiO5 have a number of advantages compared to other crystals :
bigger density, high atomic number, relatively low refractive index, high light output, short time
for scintillations decay. The drawback of the known scintillating material is a big scattering of the
most important scintillating parameters:
the value of a light output, the position of a luminescence maximum and time of luminescence.
This is explicitly demonstrated by experimental results (J.D. Naud, T.A. Tombrello, C.I. Melcher,
J.S. Schweizer "The role of cerium sites in the scintillation mechanism of LSO" IEEE
transactions on nuclear science, vol. 43, N 3, (1996), p. 1324- 1328.)The scattering of scintillating elements patameters of lutetium oxyorthosilicate with cerium is the
result of a small coefficient of cerium ions distribution between a growing crystal and melt (KCe =
0.25), as a result of which a boule, grown by Czochralski method, has a concentration of cerium
which is several times higher in the lower part than in the upper one. This brings about the fact
that the light output of samples luminescence is 2 - 5 times lower in the lower part than in the top
part, and the decay time is increased from 41 ns to 50 ns. Such scattering of parameters allows to
use only a small part of a crystal boule for the production of scintillating elements. As a prototype for the proposed invention it
