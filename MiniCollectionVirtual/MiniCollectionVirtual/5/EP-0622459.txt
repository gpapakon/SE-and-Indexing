<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a process for preparing, in 
large quantities, VIP analogs having potent biological 

activity and good stability by utilizing recombinant DNA 
technology. 
Thus, a DNA coding for a peptide comprising a leader 
peptide derived from Sarcophaga lectin and one molecule, or a 

plurality of molecules arranged in tandem, of a polypeptide 
of the general formula: 


wherein R₁ is Asp or Gly, R₂ is Asn or Gln, R₃ is Arg or Lys, 
R₄ is Val, Ala or Lys, R₅ is Lys or Leu, R₆ is Asn, Gln or 

Lys, R₇ is Ser, Lys or Ala, R₈ is Ile, Ala or Leu, R₉ is Leu 
or Lys and R₁₀ is Asn, Lys or Arg, is inserted into an 

expression plasmid, 
Escherichia
coli
 is transformed with the 
resulting recombinant plasmid, and the transformant is 

cultured to give large quantity expression of the above-mentioned 
polypeptide in the form of a fused protein. 

Treatment of the fused protein with cyanogen bromide gives a 
biologically active VIP analog (in which the C-terminal amino 

acid residue is not Met but a homoserine or homoserine 
lactone residue derived from Met).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fused proteins for 
preparing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) analogs, to 
a method of producing VIP analogs, and to recombinant 
plasmids and transformant microorganisms for producing the 
fused proteins. A number of smooth muscle relaxant polypeptides have 
been discovered. VIP is a peptide hormone isolated and 
purified in 1970 by Said and Mutt from a subfraction in the 
process of secretin extraction and purification from the 
porcine duodenum. It consists of 28 amino acid residues with 
a C-terminal amide. The primary structure (amino acid 
sequence) of VIP was elucidated in 1974 and found to be 
similar to that of glucagon or secretin, for instance, and, 
therefore, VIP is now regarded as a peptide hormone belonging 
to the glucagon-secretin family. Later, VIP was found to be present not only in the 
digestive tract but also in the nervous system and so forth. 
It has diverse biological activities. Thus, reportedly, it 
has potent vasodilating and hypotensive activity, smooth 
muscle relaxant activity, intestinal juice secretion 
promoting activity, pancreatic juice and bile secretion  
 
promoting activity, gastric juice secretion suppressing 
activity, glycogenolytic activity, pituitary hormone 
secretion promoting activity, genitalial blood flow 
regulating activity and bronchodilating activity, among 
others. Among these biological activities, the bronchial 
smooth muscle relaxant activity of VIP is expected to be 
useful in the treatment of bronchial asthma and the 
vasodilating activity of VIP on trabeculae corporum 
cavernosorum of the penis is expected to be useful in the 
treatment of impotence. However, extraction and isolation of VIP from animal 
organs or chemical synthesis of VIP has many problems, 
especially with respect to productivity, production 
efficiency, purity and production cost. Furthermore, VIP is 
physico-chemically unstable and can be readily decomposed by 
enzymes found in the living body. Therefore, VIP has been 
considered very difficult to put into practical use as a 
drug. To solve the above problems, earnest studies have 
been made on VIP analogs at least comparable in biological 
activity to VIP or VIP analogs superior in stability to VIP. 
Thus, for example, the following study results have been 
reported. As regards chemically synthesized VIP analogs, 
polypeptides resulting from substitution of a leucine or  
 
norleucine residue for the methionine residue at position 17 
of VIP have similar biological activities to those of
