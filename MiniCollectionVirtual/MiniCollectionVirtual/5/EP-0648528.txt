<ABSTRACT>
A porous prilled product, particularly ammonium nitrate, 
and its method of preparation, which includes encapsulated 

microspheres, particularly polymer microballoons, which 
serve to reduce the density of the product. 
The invention also extends to an explosives composition 
particularly ANFO and heavy ANFO, including such ammonium 

nitrate of reduced density.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a porous prilled product, particularly porous prilled ammonium nitrate.In this specification the term 'porous prilled' is used to refer to a particulate product which, in the case of ammonium
nitrate, contains less than 0.5%. preferably less than 0, 2%, water on a mass per mass basis.Porous prilled ammonium nitrate is commonly employed as one of the components of explosive compositions used
in the mining industry.Thus. for example, porous prilled ammonium nitrate is mixed with fuel oil to form the explosive composition known
as ANFO, and with an emulsion to form heavy ANFO, with or without the prior addition of fuel.For reasons of cost efficiency, and/or in order to control the total explosive power of a particular charge; a low density
ammonium nitrate prill is often preferred and various methods have been devised for producing such a product. In
general such methods relate to the prilling of less concentrated solutions of ammonium nitrate.Such a method is for example this described in Australian Patent 621,994. In this patent, ammonium nitrate and low
density particulate bulking material are blended together while said ammonium nitrate is in a molten state. The ammonium
nitrate containing low density particulate material is subsequently formed as particles. This patent describes a two
steps process for obtaining prilled product.Apart from the fact that the aforesaid known methods have limits of practicality, they also place a heavy burden on
available drying equipment. Also, the resulting prills, although having the desired higher porosity and hence lower density,
are usually of relatively low mechanical strength, often to the extent where they are useless in practical application.It is accordingly an object of this invention to provide a porous prilled product particularly ammonium nitrate, of
reduced density and its method of preparation, with which the aforesaid problems can be overcome or at least minimised.
A further object is to provide an explosive composition including such a pnlled ammonium nitrate of reduced
density.According to the invention a porous prilled ammonium nitrate product is provided which includes hollow polymer microspheres being polymer balloons
which had expanded during the prilling process to a size between 2
and 150 micro meter, incorporated in the crystalline structure.Applicant has found that the presence of such microspheres reduces the density of the product substantially.Preferably the microspheres have the following physical properties in the
