<ABSTRACT>
A tristate output buffer circuit provides overvoltage 
protection from voltage signals on a common bus having a 

higher voltage level than the internal high potential power 
rail of the tristate output buffer circuit. A high 

potential level pseudorail (PV) is coupled to the NWELL of a 
P channel output pullup transistor (P4). A comparator 

circuit (P5, P6) couples the pseudorail (PV) to the output 
(VOUT). The comparator circuit passgates (P5,P6) are 

constructed to couple the pseudorail (PV) to the high 
potential power rail (VCC) for VOUT 
<
 VCC and to couple the 
pseudorail (PV) to the output (VOUT) for VOUT 
>
 VCC.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new tristate output buffer
circuit applicable for multiple output buffer circuit
systems driving a common external bus. The invention
permits multiple output buffer circuits with multiple
incompatible power supplies to operate on the common
external bus. For example, the invention provides
overvoltage protection for output driver circuits operating
with the new JEDEC Standard 8-1A 3.3v power supply from 5
volt signals applied on the common bus by output buffer
circuits operating with JEDEC Standard 18 and 20 5v power
supplies. The protected tristate output buffer circuit of
the present invention is particularly applicable for use in
notebook, note pad, and personal digital assistant personal
computers that utilize the new 3.3v power supply standard
but which must also operate with peripheral equipment that
utilizes the 5v standard power supply.In 1992 the Joint Electron Device Engineering Council
(JEDEC) of the Electronic Industries Association (EIA)
passed a new low voltage integrated circuit standard based
on a 3.3v nominal power supply. This new low voltage
standard is designated the JEDEC Standard 8-1A and is now
commonly known as the 3v standard. The new JEDEC Standard
8-1A at nominal 3.3v is incompatible with the conventional
integrated circuit JEDEC Standards 18 and 20 specifying a 5v
power supply.In NWELL CMOS technology, the P channel or PMOS
transistors are formed with P+ source and drain regions
formed in an NWELL which is in turn formed in a grounded P
type substrate. The NWELL of a PMOS output pullup 
transistor of the output buffer circuit is coupled to the
high potential power rail VCC. If a standard output buffer
circuit supplied by the new 3.3v standard power supply has a
5v signal applied to its output from the common external
bus, the PN junction between the P+ drain and NWELL will
forward bias. This creates a low impedance path from the 5v
common external bus, to the internal 3.3v power rail with
disruptive effects. It is therefore generally not allowed
to have on a common external bus multiple tristate output
buffer circuits with incompatible power supplies.It is a general object of the present invention to provide
an improved overvoltage protection in multiple output buffer
circuit systems with multiple incompatible power supplies.Another object of the invention is to provide a new
overvoltage tolerant tristate output buffer circuit with
increased protection and isolation of a lower voltage
internal power supply rail such as a 3.3v standard power
supply
