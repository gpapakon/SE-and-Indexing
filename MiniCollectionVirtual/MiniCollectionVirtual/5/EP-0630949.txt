<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat-stable violet pigment composition comprising a
2,9-dichloroquinacridone pigment and a sulfonic acid derivative of an indanthrone or a
copper phthalocyanine compound. The violet pigment compositions are useful for
pigmenting engineering plastics.The object of the present invention is to provide a violet-colored quinacridone pigment of
high saturation which has the heat stability required for utility as a pigment in engineering
plastics. This object is achieved by preparing violet pigment compositions comprising a
2,9-dichloroquinacridone pigment in combination with a sulfonic acid or a sulfonic acid
salt of a blue-colored indanthrone or copper phthalocyanine.Quinacridones are valuable pigments. The beta crystal modification of the unsubstituted
quinacridone, C.I. Pigment Violet 19, is known for its attractive violet color. Although it is
of coloristic interest, the violet-colored beta-phase of unsubstituted quinacridone possesses
insufficient heat stability to have utility for pigmenting the engineering plastics.Since 2,9-dichloroquinacridone having a specific surface area below 30 m2/g has good
heat stability, it is useful for pigmenting engineering plastics. However, due to its large
particle size, the color is shifted to a unique red color shade from the known magenta color
of smaller particle size 2,9-dichloroquinacridone. Thus, no violet colored quinacridone
pigment is known to possess the heat-stability required for utility as a pigment for the
engineering plastics.Indanthrone and copper phthalocyanine are known in the art as blue pigments which
possess good heat stability. The sulfonic acid derivatives of indanthrone and copper
phthalocyanine are known as dyestuffs and as intermediates in the preparation of
dyestuffs.The present invention is based on the discovery that violet pigment compositions comprising
a 2,9-dichloroquinacridone pigment in combination with a sulfonic acid or a sulfonic 
acid salt of a blue-colored indanthrone or copper phthalocyanine possess high saturation
and the heat stability required for utility as a pigment in engineering plastics. In addition,
the inventive pigment compositions are highly dispersible in the plastic medium to be pigmented.
Thus, the inventive compositions provide a violet quinacridone pigment which is
suitable for the utility of pigmenting engineering plastics.Although violet mixtures of pigmentary indanthrone or copper phthalocyanine with pigmentary
2,9-dichloroquinacridone can be prepared, a larger amount of the
