<DESCRIPTION>
Present invention relates to a low cost active noise control
system for cancelling band-limited random noise in a physical
plant, comprising a speaker means which, responsive to a control
signal, generates a sound field thereby producing a residual
noise equal to the sum of said sound field and said
band-limited random noise and an error sensing means which
senses the residual noise and generates a residual signal representative
of said residual noise.US-A 4 649 505 discloses a two-input crosstalk-resistant adaptive
noise canceller. It receives on a first input a desired
speech signal portion and an undesired noise signal portion
and on a second input a reference input signal having a
reference noise input portion and a crosstalk speech portion.
A noise noise-free speech signal is obtained out of the signal
at the first input by subtracting from it a filtered second
input signal.US-A 5 219 037 discloses a component mount assembly providing
active control of vehicle vibration. It provides a system in
which e.g. an engine of a car may be mounted in a vehicle
such that the vibrations caused by the running engine do not
or only very little transmit to the rest of the vehicle. This 
system comprises one or more sensors which feed data to a
controller means. The controller means analyzes the vibrations
to determine the harmonics thereof. The controller then
constructs one or more output waveforms and feeds them to the
actuator to produce the noise suppression and operates the
actuator in response to the sensed vibration to avoid or cancel
it.A motivation of the present invention is the need for very
low cost electronics in using active noise cancellation for
quieting small fans, refrigerators and other extremely cost-sensitive
applications. The
instant invention has the ability to cancel stationary random noise such as that
encountered on a rangehood fan or tonal noise. The "plant" of the operation, i.e., the
speakers, enclosure, microphone and the configuration itself has to be of a certain
design so as to minimize delays which interfere with the plants ability to produce a
cancellation signal. These delays are the result of the response of the loudspeaker, its
cabinet and the transit time between speaker and microphone. While repetitive
compensating techniques can be used in repetitive noise, they don't work with random
noise. This invention contemplates employing strict design criteria in designing the
"plant" and using equalizing filters. The equalization filter allows for a relaxation of
the strict time
