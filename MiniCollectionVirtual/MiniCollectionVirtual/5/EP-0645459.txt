<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for determining the enzyme 
or enzymes in the human body which metabolize a particular 

drug. Microsomes are obtained from each of several donors. 
The microsome for one donor is reacted with a test drug and 

the quantity of metabolites produced is determined. The 
microsome are similarly each reacted with the test drug and 

the quantity of metabolites produced for each microsome is 
determined to generate drug m
etabolism data. The drug 
metabolism data obtained is compared to reference data which 

indicates the activity of a select number of major enzymes 
in each of the donors. The reference data for each enzyme 

is separately tabulated. The enzyme responsible for the 
metabolism of the test drug is identified when the 

metabolism data correlates with the tabulated reference data 
for that enzyme.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for determining the enzyme or enzymes in the human body 
which metabolize a particular drug. In a further respect, the invention relates to a 
kit for identifying enzymes which metabolize a particular 
drug. In still another respect, the invention relates to 
a method and apparatus for determining the liver enzyme or 
enzymes which metabolize a drug. In yet another respect, the invention relates to 
a method for determining whether a chemical is mutagenic. The liver contains enzymes that convert various 
chemical compositions to products, called metabolites, which 
can be more easily eliminated from the body, usually in the 
urine or feces. This conversion process, which is also 
known as chemical metabolism or chemical biotransformation, 
frequently determines the duration of action of 
pharmaceuticals or the intensity of the pharmaceutical 
action, which is why pharmaceuticals must typically be taken 
several times each day to treat diseases and produce other 
desirable pharmacological effects. The many pharmaceutical-metabolizing enzyme 
systems of the liver include cytochrome P450, 
carboxylesterases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, 
sulfotransferases, glutathione S-transferases and many 
others. Each of these enzyme systems is comprised of 
numerous individual enzymes, each of which is capable of 
metabolizing a wide variety of pharmaceuticals and other 
chemical compositions. For example, the cytochrome P450 
system in the human liver is comprised of at least ten 
individual P450 enzymes. Of these various enzyme systems, 
the P450 enzymes play the most important role in determining 
the rate of elimination of drugs.  Without cytochrome P450 and related enzymes, the 
naturally occurring and man-made foreign chemicals to which 
we are unavoidably exposed would accumulate in the body and 
overwhelm us. It is important to realize, however, that the 
biological or toxic effects of some chemicals are due to 
metabolites generated by cytochrome P450 and/or related 
enzymes. For example, the pharmacological effects of the 
anti-histamine, Seldane, are not due to its main ingredient, 
terfenadine, but are instead due to a metabolite of 
terfenadine that is generated by cytochrome P450. 
Similarly, the liver toxicity that can result from taking 
acetaminophen, the active ingredient in tylenol, is not due 
to acetaminophen per se, but is due to a toxic metabolite 
that is generated by cytochrome P450. Metabolism by cytochrome P450 often represents the 
rate-limi

A method for determining whether an enzyme from the 
human body metabolizes a drug, comprising the steps of 


(a) providing for the enzyme a reference data 
tabulation generated in vitro and quantifying the 

activity of the enzyme in the body of each of a 
plurality of donors, the activity of the enzyme in 

one of said donors being different from the 
activity of the enzyme in the other of said 

donors, the activity of the enzyme in said one of 
said donors with respect to the activity of the 

enzyme in each of the other of said donors 
defining a first proportional relationship; 
(b) providing from the body of each of said plurality 
of donors a donor sample of enzymes, each sample 


(i) being generated from the same type of tissue 
removed from the body of one of said donors, 

and 
(ii) having a known weight of the enzyme; 
(c) generating drug metabolism data representing the 
rate of metabolism of the drug by one of said 

donor samples, said drug metabolism data being 
generated in vitro by 


(i) contacting a fixed quantity of said drug with 
said one of said donor samples for a selected 

period of time to produce a reaction mixture; 
(ii) analyzing said reaction mixture to determine 
the quantity of metabolites present per unit 

weight of the enzyme in said one of said 
donor samples; 
(d) repeating step (c) for each of the remaining ones

metabolites present in said reaction mixture for 
one of said donor samples with respect to the 

quantity of metabolites present in said reaction 
mixture for each of the other of said donor 

samples defining a second proportional
