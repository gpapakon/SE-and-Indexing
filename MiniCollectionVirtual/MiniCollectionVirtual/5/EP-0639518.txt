<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet supply
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention further
relates to an image forming apparatus
such as a printer, a copying machine, a facsimile and
the like, in which such a sheet supply apparatus is incorporated.Among sheet supply apparatuses incorporated into
an image forming apparatus, there is a sheet supply
apparatus having a lifter means for maintaining a height
of an uppermost sheet in a sheet stack substantially
constant so that a sheet is fed out by a sheet supply
means such as a sheet supply roller at a constant height
position. In such a lifter means, in order to maintain
the height of the uppermost sheet constant, for example,
a lever is abutted against an upper surface of the sheet
stack, displacement of the lever is detected by an
electrical sensor such as a photo-sensor, and an
electrical actuator such as a motor or a strong solenoid
for lifting and lowering a sheet stacking plate on which
sheets are stacked as the sheet stack is energized on
the basis of a detection result of the electrical sensor.Further, in some conventional sheet supply 
apparatuses, a sheet supply roller can be shifted to
be abutted against or separated from the uppermost
sheet of the sheet stack the height of which is kept
constant by the lifter means. In this arrangement,
after the sheet is fed out by the sheet supply roller
abutted against the sheet, by separating the sheet
supply roller from the sheet, load (back tension) acting
on the sheet is reduced.In the past, an exclusive electrical actuator
such as a motor or a solenoid similar to that associated
with the lifter means has been used as a mechanism for
lifting and lowering the sheet supply roller with respect
to the sheet. However, in the conventional sheet supply
apparatus having the lifter means and the mechanism for
shifting the sheet supply roller, the following problems
arose:
(1) Since the electrical sensor, the actuator
for the lifter means and the exclusive actuator for
lifting and lowering the sheet supply roller must be
provided, the entire sheet supply apparatus becomes
expensive, and large electrical capacity is required;(2) Since complex wiring is required for
electrically connecting the electrical sensor and the
exclusive actuators to associated elements, miss-wiring
is apt to occur; and(3) Electrical control sequence for the sheet
supply system becomes complex, and, thus malfunction is apt to occure.According to the document JP-A-63176225 there is disclosed a
generic sheet supply

sheet supporting means (4b) to actuate said clutch means (17,
24) when the height of the upper surface of the sheet stack

is below a predetermined height;
characterized by
a rock means (18) for rocking a ratchet pawl (19)
pivotally mounted on a shaft (20) by the rotation transmitted

by said clutch means (17, 24), wherein
said ratchet gear (22) is engageable by said ratchet pawl
(19) and rotated by a rocking movement of said ratchet pawl

around said shaft (20).
A sheet supply apparatus according to claim 1, wherein
said clutch means has a notched gear (17) having a notched 

portion and a regulation means (24) for regulating a position
of said notched gear when said notched portion is opposed to

said drive gear (13), and said clutch means (17, 24) serves
to transmit a predetermined amount of rotation in such a

manner that the rotation of said drive gear is transmitted to
said notched gear (17) when said notched gear is engaged by

said drive gear and said notched gear is stopped when said
notched portion is opposed to said drive gear.
