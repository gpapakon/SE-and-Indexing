<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an original 
reading apparatus comprising a pre-scan mode for 

reading a color reference member before a reading 
mode for reading an original is effected. Wherein 

the pre-scan mode is effected by rotating a single 
motor in one direction, and the reading mode is 

effected by rotating the motor in the other 
direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an original
reading apparatus and an information processing
apparatus having such an original reading apparatus,
and more particularly it relates to an information
processing apparatus such as a facsimile machine,
an image reader, a digital copying machine, an
electronic black board and the like having a reading
apparatus as an input portion for reading information
on an original to be read while relatively shifting
the original in a condition that the original is
closely contacted (including light contact) with
an original reading surface.Recently, in order to make information
processing apparatuses such as facsimiles, image
readers and the like compact and to improve the
performance of such information processing
apparatuses, there has been proposed an elongated
line-sensor which can be used with an
equi-magnification optical system as a photoelectric
conversion device for a reading apparatus or which
can be used without any specific optical system. 
Particularly, reading apparatuses wherein reflection
light including information from an original can
be directly detected by a photoelectric conversion
device through a transparent spacer such as glass
without using an equi-magnification fiber lens array,
thereby making the apparatus compact and inexpensive
have been put to practical use.Incidentally, hereinafter, an optical
conversion apparatus of the type wherein information
is read without any optical system is particularly
referred to as "image sensor of complete contact
type".Fig. 24 is a schematic enlarged sectional
view showing an example of a reading portion of
a conventional reading apparatus using an image
sensor of complete contact type. The image sensor
108 of complete contact type is designed so that
light from a light source such as an LED is
directed to an original 103 and the light reflected
from the original at an image information reading position corresponding to
an image reading portion 110 is incident
to a photoelectric conversion element, where
image information of the original 103 is converted
into an electric signal which is in turn sent to
a control portion (not shown). Since the image
sensor 108 of complete contact type has no beam
condensing unit such as a lens for directing the 
light reflected from the original at the image
reading portion 110 to the photoelectric
conversion element, the depth field of the image
sensor is 50 - 80 µm at the most.Thus, if the original 103 is floating from
a reading glass surface of the image sensor 108
of

<CLAIMS>
An original reading apparatus comprising:

a first rotary member (4) for conveying an original;
an image reading portion (8, 10) disposed downstream

of said first rotary member (4);
a second rotary member (9) disposed at an image
information reading position for conveying the original;
a motor (23); and
a transmission means for transmitting the rotation of
said motor (23) to said second rotary member (9), wherein

said transmission means rotates said second rotary member
(9) in a normal direction by using the rotation of said

motor (23) in a first direction and wherein said
transmission means rotates said second rotary member (9) in

a reverse direction by using the rotation of said motor
(23) in a second direction,
wherein reading of the original is effected while the
original is conveyed by means of said second rotary member

reading portion (8, 10) is caused to oppose the color

reference member (22) by rotating the motor (23) in said
second direction, and 
wherein said apparatus is operative to perform a
registration mode for aligning a tip end of the original

before reading is effected,
