<ABSTRACT>
A spiral wound gasket having multiple windings of spirally wound strips of metal, fire resistant compressible filler material and oxidizer resistant compressible filler material is disclosed. The fire resistant filler material is arranged in a region toward the outside periphery of the gasket and the oxidizer resistant compressible material is arranged in a region radially closer to the inside periphery of the gasket. The gasket has excellent sealability characteristics from low to high gasket seating stresses, and is effective for use with corrosive chemicals while providing a measure of protection in fire situations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application 
Serial No. 07/916,925 filed July 20, 1992. This invention relates generally to seals or gaskets, and more 
particularly to a spirally wound gasket. Spirally wound gaskets known in the art generally consist of 
alternate layers of a thin strip of metal , such as stainless 
steel, and a thin strip of a soft, non-metallic filler material 
which together are wound in a spiral to form an annular ring. The 
layered edges of the strips of filler materials form sealing 
surfaces. Suitable filler materials include various fluorocarbon 
polymers, asbestos, exfoliated graphite (GrafoilÂ®) and ceramic. The metallic strip is typically formed with a central, 
generally V-shaped fold or indentation throughout its length, and 
to either side of the fold are substantially flat portions. The 
filler material assumes this shape also. The purpose of the V-shaped fold is to establish a path along 
which the metal strip can deform, in a resilient or elastic manner, 
as the gasket is compressed between the surfaces to be sealed. 
Effectively, the apex of the V-shape acts as a hinge about which 
the legs of the V pivot. Since the filler material itself is 
usually soft and non-resilient, the metal strip is required to 
force the filler to interfere with the surfaces to be sealed. One drawback of previously known spiral wound gaskets is that 
they either tend to degrade upon exposure to highly corrosive  
 
oxidizing materials, as is the case with graphite filler material; 
or they degrade upon exposure to elevated temperatures, such as in 
a fire situation, as is the case with some fluoropolymer filler 
materials. A spiral wound gasket having the chemical inertness of 
polytetrafluoroethylene and the high temperature stability of 
graphite for leak prevention during fire situations is presently 
unknown. Due to this degradation, known PTFE spiral wound gaskets are 
usually not acceptable for use in "fire-safe" valves or flanges. 
To qualify as "fire-safe", a valve or flange is subjected to high 
temperature as in an open flame environment and, over a fixed 
period of time during the test, leakage from the valve or flange 
must not exceed a certain limited quantity. A major application 
for "fire-safe" valves or flanges is in the transport of highly 
corrosive liquids such as concentrated sulfuric acid, the leakage 
of which during a fire can be disastrous. DE-U-9 113 953 discloses a spiral wound gasket comprising a 
spirally wound metal strip extending between an inside

A spirally wound gasket (10), the gasket having an inside periphery 
(13) and an outside periphery (11), which comprises: 


a spirally wound metal strip (14) extending between the inside periphery 
and the outside periphery of the gasket; 
a fire resistant compressible filler material (22) disposed between 
windings of the strip comprising a graphite; 
an oxidizer resistant compressible filler (23) material comprising 
expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) disposed between windings 

of the strip in an area adjacent to the inside periphery, the expanded porous 
PTFE being disposed flush with the strip; 
wherein the gasket is both fire resistant and provides an effective seal at 
low gasket seating stresses.

sealing surfaces (32,32") of a joint (31) when mounted in place. 
The gasket of Claim 1 wherein the gasket (10) provide a tightness 
parameter (Tp) of 44 at a gasket stress level of 6.90MPa.
