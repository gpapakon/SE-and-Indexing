<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a switching apparatus fitted with at least one power pole comprising a contact bridge (11) interacting with fixed contacts (13,14) and capable of being manoeuvred either by the movable parts (42) of an electromagnet (4) or by a lock mechanism (5) and characterised in that the contact bridge (11) is rotatably mounted and in that the moving parts of the electromagnet actuate this contact bridge via a movement-changing mechanism (2).

<CLAIMS>
Switch apparatus fitted with at least one power 
pole containing a contact holder (12) equipped with a 

contact bridge (11) which co-operates with fixed 
contacts (13, 14) and which can be activated by an 

electromagnet (4) or a locking mechanism (5) , 
characterized by the fact that the pressure springs 

(19) are fitted between the contact bridge (11) and the 
contact holder (12), and that an activating mechanism 

(21, 22, 23, 24, 25), which may be moved independently 
either by the electromagnet (4) or by the locking 

mechanism (5), acts on a driving part (17) of the 
contact holder so as to allow it to operate 

independently as a contactor or circuit breaker. 
Apparatus of claim 1 characterized by the fact 
that the contact bridge (11) is housed in a cartridge 

(1), forming the sectioning chamber. 
Apparatus of claim 2 characterized by the fact 
that each cartridge (2) has a drive crank (17) from the 

contact bridge which extends to the outside of the 
envelope of the said cartridge and is linked by the 

activating mechanism (2) to the moving parts of the 
electromagnet. 
Apparatus of claim 3 characterized by the fact 
that the drive crank (17) is mechanically coupled to a  

 
link assembly (21 - 22) and that the moving parts (42) 

of the electromagnet act on the link assembly pin (23). 
Apparatus of claim 4 characterized by the fact 
that one of the link arms of the link assembly (21-22) 

is hinged on a fixed point (221). 
Apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized by 
the fact that each drive crank (17) of a rotating 

contact holder is connected by a link to a link arm 
(28) which pivots on a fixed pin (281) whose pivoting 

movement is controlled by the electromagnet. 
Apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized by 
the fact that it has a link arm (24) coupled by a first 

hinged link (27, 45) to the moving parts of the 
electromagnet and by a second hinged link (171) to the 

drive crank (17) of each cartridge (1). 
Apparatus of claim 7 characterized by the fact 
that the second hinged link (171) may be removed. 
Apparatus of claim 1 characterized by the fact 
that it has devices (21 - 22) for mechanically coupling 

the contact holders (11) and a lock (5), and devices 
for mechanically and independently coupling the said 

contact holder (11) to the moving parts of the 
electromagnet. 
Apparatus of claim 9 characterized by the fact 
that the contact holder (11) is mechanically linked to 

the lock (5) by means of a link assembly (21 - 22) and 
that the moving parts of the electromagnet act on the 

link assembly pin (23) by means of a sliding, hinged 
connection (25), which permits independent operation as 

a contactor or circuit breaker. 
Apparatus of claim 10 characterized by the 
fact that the sliding connection (25) is formed by a 

slide groove (25) in the link arm (24) and in which the 
link assembly pin (23) slides.  

 
Apparatus of claim 11 characterized by the 
fact that the slide groove (25) is open-ended so as to 

permit dismantling. 
Apparatus as claimed in any of the above 
claims characterized by the fact that it has a 

protection module (6).
