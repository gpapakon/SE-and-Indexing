<ABSTRACT>
An overvoltage protection element (1) for dissipating transient overvoltages is illustrated and described, having two electrodes (2), an air discharge spark gap (3) acting between the electrodes (2), and a housing (4) which accommodates the electrodes (2), each electrode (2) having a connecting limb (5) and a spark horn (6) which runs at an acute angle with respect to the connecting limb (5), and the spark horns (6) of the two electrodes (2) - which are arranged at a distance from one another - together forming the air discharge spark gap (3). The overvoltage protection element (1) according to the invention is improved in terms of its overvoltage protection behaviour, particularly with respect to the response voltage, the lightning-current carrying capacity, the line follow current carrying capacity and the line follow current extinguishing behaviour, to be precise primary in that the spark horns (6) of the electrodes (2) are provided in their regions adjacent to the connecting limbs (5) with a hole (7) which runs through the connecting limbs (5).

An overvoltage protection element For the discharging of transient overvoltages,
comprising two electrodes (2), an air disruptive breakdown spark gap (3) which is effective

between the electrodes (2) and a housing (4) which receives the electrodes (2), wherein each
electrode (2) comprises a connection limb (5) and a spark conductor (6) running at an acute angle

to the connection limb (5), and the spark conductors (6) of the two electrodes (2), which
electrodes are disposed at a distance from each other, form the air disruptive breakdown spark

gap (3), and wherein the spark conductors (6) of the electrodes (2) are provided with bores (7)
in their regions adjacent to the connection limbs (5), characterised in that a sparking aid (10)

which triggers a sliding discharge is provided between the opposite ends of the connection limbs
(5) of the two electrodes (2), and the sparking aid (10) projects into the air disruptive breakdown

spark gap (3) as far as the middle of the bores (7) or slightly further.
An overvoltage protection element according to claim 1, characterised in that the sparking
aid (10) consists of an insulating material which on a change of state, for example on heating, does

not release carbon to an extent which impairs operation.
An overvoltage protection element according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
sparking aid (10) is of V-shaped or concave construction on its face which faces the air disruptive

breakdown spark gap (3).
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised
in that the sparking aid (10) is provided with a narrow slit (11) which extends into the air

disruptive breakdown spark gap (3).
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised
in that the angle between the mutually facing spark conductors (6) is about 30 degrees.
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised
in that the spark conductors (6) have a width of less than 15 mm, particularly of about 8 mm. 
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the bores (7) are parallel to the connection limbs (5).
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterised
in that the bores (7) are provided centrally in the spark conductors (6).
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 8, characterised
in that each spark conductor (6) of each electrode (2) is provided with two bores (7) disposed one

above the other.
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 9, characterised
in that the spark conductors (6) of the electrodes (2) are provided with a chamfer (8) or rounded

portion on both sides.
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 10, characterised
in that the spark conductors (6) ofthe electrodes (2) are of convex construction on their mutually

facing faces.
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterised
in that the spark conductors (6) of the electrodes (2) are provided on their faces facing away from

each other with slots (9), which preferably extend transversely to the longitudinal extent of the
spark conductors (6).
An overvoltage protection element according to either one of claims 1 to 2, characterised
in that the housing (4) at least partially consists of a synthetic material which releases no carbon

on heating or combustion, or is at least partially lined with a synthetic material such as this.
An overvoltage protection element according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised

in that the sidewalls (12) of the housing (4) are drawn in relatively near to the spark conductors
