<ABSTRACT>
The valve actuator comprises a base (1) with a base 
flange (3) and an output shaft (5) rotatable in the latter, 

as well as a cylinder (6) containing a piston (7) with an 
intergrally shaped tubular conversion member (8) with external 

helical grooves (9) and internal straight splines (11) 
engaging with corresponding helical ridges (10) in the central 

bore in the base and straight splines (12) on the output 
shaft (5) converting an upward or downward movement of the 

piston (7) to a rotational movement of the piston (7) and the 
output shaft (5) in one direction or the other, and a spring 

housing (2) consisting of a shell (16) and a cover (17) and 
containing a dished-spring stack (13), the latter exerting 

a downwardly directed force on the piston (7) through a 
spring hub (26) and an axial-thrust roller bearing (28). 

When pressurized fluid is supplied to the space below the 
piston (7) and the conversion member (8), these components 

move upwardly against the force from the dished-spring stack 
(13), causing the output shaft (5) to rotate in one direction, 

and when the fluid pressure is released, the force 
from the dished-spring stack (13) moves the piston (7) and 

the conversion member (8) downwardly, so that the output 
shaft (5) rotates in the opposite direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid-actuated
valve actuator of the kind set forth in the preamble of
claim 1.Valve actuators of this kind are e.g. used for actuating
valves in pipelines for gas og oil, in which the
valve is required to close or open respectively in case of
accidents, especially loss of fluid pressure, said opening
or closing in such cases being produced by the force of
the dished-spring stack.In a previously known valve actuator of the kind
referred to above, the dished-spring stack is placed coaxially
about the relatively long output shaft between the stack
and the internal wall of the housing, one end of the stack
being supported by the base flange, while the cylinder is
closed upwardly by the top cover, and the piston will, when
fluid pressure is applied, move the conversion member in
the form of a separate component downwardly against the force
from the dished-spring stack.This known valve actuator suffers from several disadvantages,
thus:
it requires a large amount of space in the height direction,
which is undesirable for many applications,the work of assembling it during manufacture is cumbersome
and time-consuming, andlast but not least: in practice, it has not been proved
possible to design it in such a manner, that the force
exerted by the dished-spring stack can be converted into
a torque of a magnitude sufficient for opening or closing
large valves.It is the object of the present invention to provide
a fluid-actuated valve actuator of the kind set forth in
the preamble of claim 1, that is compact in construction
and especially has a small height, and which is substantially
easier to assemble than the previously known valve actuator, 
and this object is achieved with a valve actuator, according
to the present invention characterized by the features set
forth in the characterizing clause of claim 1.With this arrangement, the functional parts of the
valve actuator are arranged substantially in the opposite
sense relative to the placing of these components in the
previously known valve actuator, with the spring stack uppermost
and situated by itself in the spring housing and
the remaining components of the valve actuator comprised in
the base connected to the spring housing. Achieved thereby
is
that the valve actuator is compact in construction,that during manufacture, the valve actuator can be assembled
with a minimum amount of work, andlast, but not least, that it is possible to construct
the dished-spring stack independently of the remaining
components of the valve

Fluid-actuated valve actuator, especially for
submarine use, and of the kind comprising


a) a housing comprising a base flange (3) and a top cover

b) a piston (7) movable in a fluid cylinder (6) placed in
said housing against the force from a pre-stressed dished-spring

stack (13),
c) an output shaft (5) in said housing adapted to be connected
to a valve spindle, and
d) a tubular conversion member (8) adapted to move together
with said piston (7) and, by means of helical grooves (9)

and straight splines (11) in engagement with corresponding
helical ridges (10) and straight splines (12) in the housing

shaft, and
f) that the housing is divided into

f1) a base (1) comprising the cylinder (6), the piston (7)
