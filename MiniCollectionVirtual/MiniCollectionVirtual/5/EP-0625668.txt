<ABSTRACT>
A gas line override valve for connecting an external gas 
source to an operational gas line includes a sleeve (10) having an 

inlet end (11) and an outlet end (13) adapted for series connection of 
the sleeve in the operational gas line, a hole (19) through a wall 

of the sleeve and a coupling secured in the hole having a 
passage in pneumatic communication between a first port in the 

coupling external of the sleeve and a second port in the 
coupling internal of the sleeve, the second port having an 

annular seat along a perimeter thereof. A cage extending from 
the second port into the sleeve loosely contains a ball of 

diameter greater than the diameter of the annular seat. The 
cage has openings therethrough for continuous pneumatic 

communication between the inlet and outlet ends of the sleeve. 
The ball is free to move into and out of abutting interface 

with the seat to close the second port when the pressure in 
the sleeve exceeds the pressure in the coupling passage and to 

open the second port when the pressure in the coupling passage 
exceeds the pressure in the sleeve.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to gas distribution 
systems and more particularly concerns valves used to 
temporarily connect external gas sources to operational 
customer gas lines. The basic concept of a gas line override valve is 
explained in my Patent No. 5,178,188 which teaches the use of 
a meter bypass swivel connector in the replacement of natural 
gas meters. In that application, a quick disconnect coupler 
91 is snugly attached in a hole provided in a sleeve in the 
operational gas line. The coupler has a bias mechanism which 
prevents flow of gas through the coupler under normal 
conditions. Pressure from an external source on the biasing 
means opens the coupler to permit flow of gas from the 
external source into the sleeve. While this arrangement works 
effectively, the gas flow rate from the external source into 
the gas lines is limited by the biased coupler. In another application of override valves, gas companies 
generally insert a regulator in the aboveground gas company 
line connecting the gas meter to the underground gas company 
feeder system. The pressure in the gas company's line is 
generally 50 to 60 psi and the regulator reduces the pressure 
on the customer side of the regulator to 9.2 inches of water 
column up to 2 pound systems. It is now becoming common 
practice for a gas company to insert a pressure excess flow 
valve with a manual reset in the underground line. This valve 
will close to cut off the underground line flow and protect 
the 9.2 inch water column side of the system if an increase in 
pressure exceeds the capacity of the 9.2 inch water column. 
However, once the underground excess flow valve has been 
operated, accessing the buried manual reset is a very 
expensive problem.  It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide 
a gas line override valve having a quick disconnect coupler 
which maximizes input gas flow through the coupler into the 
operational gas lines. Another object of this invention is to 
provide a gas line override valve connectable above ground 
between the operational gas line regulator and the underground 
feeder to the system. It is also an object of this invention 
to provide a gas line override valve connectable in the high 
pressure side of an operational gas line capable of feeding 
gas at pressures sufficient to overcome the input pressures to 
the excess flow valve and thus reset the manual reset of the 
excess flow valve. A further object of this invention is to 
provide a gas line override valve which facilitates

A gas line override valve for connecting an external 
gas source to an operational gas line comprising: 

   a sleeve having an inlet end and an outlet end adapted 
for series connection of said sleeve in the operational gas 

line; 
   a hole through a wall of said sleeve; 

   a coupling secured in said hole having a passage in 
pneumatic communication between a first port in said coupling 

external of said sleeve and a second port in said coupling 
internal of said sleeve, said second port having an annular 

seat along a perimeter thereof; and 
   a cage extending from said second port into said sleeve 

and loosely containing a ball of diameter greater than said 
annular seat therein, said cage having openings therethrough 

for continuous pneumatic communication between said inlet and 
said outlet ends of said sleeve, said ball being free to move 

into and out of abutting interface with said seat to close

in said coupling passage and to open said second port when 
pressure in said coupling passage exceeds pressure in said 

sleeve, respectively. 
A valve according to claim 1, said cage being 
cylindrical and said openings being diametrically opposed 

slots of length greater than said ball diameter and of width 
less than said ball diameter. 
A valve according to claim 2, said cylindrical cage 
extending into said sleeve to a point closer to a wall of said 

sleeve than the length of said ball diameter. 
A valve according to claim 2, said coupling and said 
cage being aligned transversely in relation to said sleeve. 
A valve according to claim 4, said coupling and said 
sleeve being aligned diametrically in relation to said sleeve. 
A valve according to claim 1, said coupling being 
threadedly engaged in said hole. 
A valve according to claim 1, said first port being 
adapted for connection to the external gas source.
