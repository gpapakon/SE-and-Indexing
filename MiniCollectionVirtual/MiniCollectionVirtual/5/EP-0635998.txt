<ABSTRACT>
A method and pharmaceutical composition for inhibiting viral replication in infected cells are described. The pharmaceutical composition includes a DNA fragment which has covalently linked strands. The DNA fragment contains a 6-30 base pair region whose sequence corresponds to that of a regulatory element in a virus. The method includes introducing a fragment into the cell in an amount sufficient to inhibit replication of the virus in the cell.

International Congress and Symposium Service (London) , Royal Society of Medicine, 3-23 (1986) .Background of the InventionThe challenge in developing an effective therapy and prophylaxis for viral disease is to achieve inhibition of viral processes without producing extreme side effects and preferably without inducing viral resistance. Since viral replication requires use of the cellular apparatus of the host, treating virus infection by inhibiting viral replication can be lethal to the infected host cells as well. Ideally, an anti-viral therapeutic would act selectively to inhibit or eliminate some vital part of viral processes, without affecting the host cell.Currently, the most widely used anti-viral agents are nucleoside analogs. This class of drugs acts by disrupting viral replication, either by inhibiting en¬ zymes required for nucleic acid processing, or by produ- cing a defective viral genome, such as by premature 

termination of replication. As an example, acyclovir, a purine analog used in treating a variety of viral dis¬ eases, including herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2)
