<ABSTRACT>
A fiber reinforced plastics pipe comprising a 
cylindrical inner layer formed by winding a prepreg sheet 

containing a thermosetting resin as a matrix and an outer 
layer formed by winding a thermoplastic resin sheet or tape 

around the inner layer, said inner and outer layers being 
heat cured and thermocompression bonded into one united body; 

and a process for manufacturing the fiber reinforced 
plastic pipe. When the fiber reinforced plastics pipe is 

manufactured, the thermosetting resin is used for forming 
the inner layer and the thermoplastic resin is used for 

forming the outer layer. Moreover, a metal coat can be 
firmly bonded to the surface of the outer layer. Hence, a 

fiber reinforced plastics pipe with significantly improved 
impact resistance, abrasion resistance and lightweight 

properties can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to a fiber reinforced plastics
pipe (tube) which can be advantageously used for an automobile
driving shaft, a roll for transferring a film, a printing
roll, etc. as its applications, and a process for
producing the same. In particular, the invention
pertains to a fiber reinforced plastics pipe comprising an
inner layer made of a fiber reinforced plastic containing a
thermosetting resin as a matrix and an outer layer made of
a thermoplastic resin, which shows high bond strength
between these layers and good dimensional stability and is
provided outside of the outer layer with a
metal-plated layer having high bond strength to the outer
layer, and also provides a process for producing said
pipe.Fiber reinforced plastics (FRP) pipes have been
heretofore manufactured by impregnating a reinforcing
material such as inorganic fibers (e.g, glass fibers and
carbon fibers) or organic fibers (e.g., aramide fibers)
with an uncured thermosetting resin, a thermoplastic resin
or other resin as a matrix, charging a mold with these 
starting materials, drawing the starting materials, or
extruding the starting materials, to make them into a shape
of a pipe.Of such starting materials as mentioned above, carbon
fiber reinforced plastics (hereinafter abbreviated to
"CFRP") excellent in specific strength and specific modulus
of elasticity have been predominantly employed in recent
years. As the matrix resin, thermosetting resins are used
in most cases because of their excellent heat resistance,
water resistance, solvent resistance, chemical resistance,
dimensional stability, etc., and among these resins, epoxy
resins, which show high bond strength to carbon fibers, are
mainly used as the matrix.DE-A- 24 24 207 teaches forming a fibre reinforced pipe by winding a
sheet of fibres impregnated with a thermosetting resin as a matrix,
winding an outer layer of a thermoplastic resin film around this inner
layer, and curing the layers using heat and pressure.A prepreg obtained by impregnating carbon fibers with
the epoxy resin and subjecting the resin to the B-stage
procedure (i.e., drying a liquid thermosetting resin to
polymerize it to a certain degree) is commercially
available. This prepreg is wound around a mandrel and heat
cured to form a pipe. The pipe can be also formed by
winding a bundle of fibers (strands or filaments)
impregnated with the epoxy resin around a mandrel at a
certain angle through filament winding and then curing the
resin. The pipes formed by the above methods can be perse
used
