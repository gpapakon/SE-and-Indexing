<ABSTRACT>
A process for extracting hydrocarbons from subterranean formations involves treating the hydrocarbon-containing 
stratum (1) and removing the hydrocarbons therefrom through a well (2). Treatment of the hydrocarbon-containing stratum 

(1) is effected by subjecting the underlying aquiferous stratum (3) to elastic vibrations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to oil and gas 
production, particularly, to methods for producing oil, 
gas condensate, gas, and can be utilized at different 
stages of deposit exploitation. Presently, to the art are known various methods of 
hydrocarbon production which include an exposure of a 
hydrocarbon containing bed to some influence or other. Known in the art is a method of oil production, 
comprising an influence on a hydrocarbon containing bed 
and extraction of hydrocarbons therefrom through a well 
(US,A,4417621). According to said method the influence is exerted 
by means of an injection of a gaseous fluid, such as 
carbon dioxide, to a hydrocarbon containing bed and 
exposure of the hydrocarbon containing bed to the action 
of elastic vibrations which increases the carbon dioxide 
flow and improves oil production efficiency. However, 
said method requires to inject substantial volumes of 
gas and, furthermore a direct action of elastic 
vibrations on a hydrocarbon containing bed leads to 
degassing of oil which results in a need to inject an 
extra volume of carbon dioxide into the hydrocarbon 
containing bed. To the art is known a method of exploiting a 
flooded oil deposit, comprising an influence on 
a hydrocarbon containing bed and extraction of 
hydrocarbons therefrom through a well (SU,A,1596081). In this method the influence is exerted by means of 
elastic vibrations from a vibration seismic source which  
 
increases oil production only from highly flooded 
deposits owing to a coagulation of oil dissipated 
through the flooded hydrocarbon contaning bed, and, 
thus, to a recovery of its mobility. Said method, however, is inefficient at exploiting 
an oil deposit having a low flooding factor inasmuch as 
in this case there occurs an accelerated motion of 
water, rather than oil, to a well, which results in an 
increased volume of water extracted from the wells, the 
oil extraction being reduced. To the art is known a method of gas condensate 
production, comprising an additional influence on a 
hydrocarbon containing bed and extraction of 
hydrocarbons therefrom through a well (S.N.Zakirov 
"Theory and Designing of Exploitation of Gas and Gas 
Condensate Deposits", 1989, Nedra, Moscow). According to said method the additional influence 
is exerted by means of repumping gas into a hydrocarbon 
containing bed, maintaining thereby a bed pressure, 
which prevents a precipitation of a portion of 
hydrocarbons to a liquid phase and their losses. 
However, a necessity to inject dried gas
