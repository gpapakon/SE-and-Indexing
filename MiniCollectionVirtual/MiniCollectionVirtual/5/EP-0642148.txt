<ABSTRACT>
An etching process is disclosed which is suited 
for manufacturing color selecting mechanisms in wide scope 

of specifications without need of complicated process of 
manufacture. 
The etching process comprises the steps of (a) 
forming an etching resist layer (20) on the front surface 

(10A) of a work (10) and also forming a protective layer 
(12) on the back surface (10B), (b) patterning the etching 

resist layer (12) to form a first opening (22) and a second 
opening (24) smaller than and near the first opening, and 

(c) etching the work to form a slit zone (32) under the 
first opening (22) and a recess (34) under the second 

opening (24) while removing at least a portion (10C) of the 
work spacing apart the slit zone (32) and the recess (34), 

thereby forming an electron beam passage slit (30) having a 
greater opening area defined on the side of the front 

surface (10A) by the slit zone (32) and the recess (34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an etching process and a
method of manufacturing a color selecting mechanism for a
color cathode-ray tube. The invention is applicable to, for
instance, the color selecting mechanism for a color
television receiver picture tube.The color picture tube usually has a color selecting
mechanism which faces the color phosphor screen. The color
phosphor screen provide color when predetermined color
phosphors are illuminated by electron beams corresponding
to individual colors R, G and B sorted by the color
selecting mechanism.As the color picture tube color selecting mechanism,
various structures have been proposed. For example, a
"Trinitron" (a registered trade name) color picture tube
uses an aperture grill type color selecting mechanism
assembly 100, as shown in the perspective view of Fig. 11,
which is disposed such that it faces a color phosphor
screen 200. The aperture grill type color 
selecting mechanism assembly 100 comprises a a thin metal
sheet 110 with a number of parallel slits 130 formed
therein such that electron beams pass through these slits.The color phosphor screen 200 comprises vertical
color stripes (not shown) of red, green and blue colors
which are arranged parallel in a predetermined sequence.
The color selecting mechanism assembly 100 is disposed such
that it faces the color phosphor screen 200. The thin
metal plate 110 has many electron beam passage slits 130
extending in the direction of the phosphor stripes at least
form the upper edge to the lower edge of the effective
screen area.Specifically, the thin metal sheet 110 of the
aperture grill type color selecting mechanism assembly 100,
is made from a high purity steel sheet which is 0.08 to
0.15 mm thick and has a number of parallel electron beam
passage slits 130. The thin metal sheet 110 is stretched
over a frame 140.The frame 140 comprises, for instance, a pair of,
i.e., an upper and a lower, frame portions 140A and 140B
and a pair of arm portions 140C and 140D connecting the
frame portions 140A and 140B to each other. The front end
surfaces of the frame portions 140A and 140B are curved
surfaces forming the same cylindrical surface. As shown in 
Fig. 11, the thin metal sheet 110 is stretched on the front
end surfaces of the frame portions 140A and 140B.The thin metal sheet 110 is mounted in the frame
140 by using turnbuckles (not shown) for pulling the frame
portions 140A and 140B of the frame 140 toward each other.
In this state, edges of the thin metal sheet 110 are welded
to the front end surfaces of

An etching process comprising the steps of:

(a) forming an etching resist layer (20) on the front
surface of a work (10) and also forming a

protective layer (12) on the back surface of the
work (10);
