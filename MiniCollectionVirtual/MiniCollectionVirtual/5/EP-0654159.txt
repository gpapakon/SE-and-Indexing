<ABSTRACT>
An interface (200) allows a given central processing unit (CPU) (102) to communicate concurrently with a large number of disk drives (110, 112, 114, 116, 118). In particular, more than one seek operation can be performed at the same time in serving a common processor (102). Additionally, the invention can combine standard physical drives (110, 112, 114, 116, 118) of any physical or logical configuration (e.g., storage capacity, number of heads) into one or more logical drives. In other words, heterogeneous physical drives (110, 112, 114, 116, 118) can be combined into one or more homogeneous logical drives as seen by the host operating system (1101). When applying the invention to IDE drives, a first on-board embodiment provides an enhanced IDE disk drive that is an extension of the industry-standard IDE drives, allowing an arbitrary number of independently seeking IDE drives on a conventially single-seeking, two-drive-maximum bus. In another "paddle board" embodiment, low cost IDE drives of arbitrary physical size, storage capacity and geometry can be combined simply and inexpensively into a high performance storage device. For example, a 3.5'' 80 megabyte (MB) drive can be transparently combined with a 2.5'' 60 MB drive.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Computer Interface For Concurrently Performing Plural Seeks on Plural Disk DrivesCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION The present patent application is a continuation-in-part (CIP) of U.S. patent application serial no. 07/926,675, filed August 10, 1992, entitled COMPUTER INTERFACE FOR MULTIPLE DISK DRIVES, naming the same inventors as the present patent application. The parent patent application is incorporated herein by reference.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to interfaces between processors and peripheral devices. More specifically, the invention relates to interfaces between processors and disk drives which allow a larger number of disk drives to be controlled by a single processor and an existing disk controller, thereby allowing concurrent seeks on more than one drive.2. Related ArtVarious patents disclose control schemes for storage media. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,623,006 (Balakian et al.) shows an early example of a "disk file optimizer" which selects a most optimum request for execution based on minimum latency time. U.S. Patent No. 3,893,178 (Sordello) provides synchronized rotation of several disks to minimize latency time, when switching from one disk to another. U.S. Patent No. 4,270,154 (Crawford) discloses a system in which several heads (or stacks of heads) are provided to minimize latency time.In U.S. Patent No. 4,494,196 (Greer) , a controller 20 is disposed between a central processor unit 10 and N peripheral data storage units 12-1 through 12-N. The Greer controller focuses on controlling data storage devices having different 

data transfer rates, using a corresponding number of instruction storage units.U.S. Patent No. 4,858,038 (Kazama) discloses a set of disk drive selector circuits for a disk drive controller which allow different "types" of disk drives to be selected.U.S. Patent No. 4,910,614 (Arai et al.) discloses a disk controller which is disposed between a host processor and several disk drives of different types. The focus of the Arai et al. patent is the presence of two types of memories: a first type of memory in one-to-one correspondence with the disk drive units, and a second set of memories defining the types of disk drives.U.S. Patent No. 4,935,828 (Frissell) discloses a seek multi-tasking disk controller in which a disk control unit 102 (Frissell's Fig. 2) is disposed between a CPU 201 and several disk drives 104, 106. As explained with reference to Frissell's Figs. 6 and 7, during a time when a data

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A computer system, comprising: a) in association, a processor, a first bus, and software normally allowing only a single seek operation at a time to be performed for the processor; b) a plurality of drives having interfaces normally not allowing plural seek operations to be performed concurrently; and c) a interface portion, interposed between the first bus and the drives, the interface portion including means for interfacing the first bus to the drives, and for allowing plural seek operations to be concurrently performed on respective plural drives for the processor using the software.
2. A computer system, comprising: a) in association, a processor, a first bus, and software normally allowing only a single seek operation at a time to be performed for the processor; and b) a plurality of enhanced drives, each enhanced drive including:
1) an unenhanced drive having an interface normally not allowing plural seek operations to be performed concurrently; and 2) means for interfacing the first bus to the drive, and for allowing plural seek operations on respective plural unenhanced drives to be concurrently performed for the processor using the software.
3. The computer system of claim 2, wherein: a) the enhanced drive further includes means for providing an interrupt signal for the processor, the interrupt signal having: 1) a first characteristic to indicate the presence of an interrupt condition; and 


 2) a second characteristic to indicate the absence of an interrupt condition; and b) the computer system further comprises means for programming a polarity of the interrupt signal, so as to change which of the first and second characteristics indicates the presence of an interrupt condition and which indicates the absence of an interrupt condition.
