hydrocarbons, or cracking of hydrocarbons. The apparatus contains reaction channels for 

the methane coupling in or adjacent to channels for the dehydrogenation or cracking reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of application Serial 
Number 07/815,244 filed December 31, 1991, the specifications and 
claims of which are incorporated by reference herein. This invention relates to chemical reactors useful to control 
simultaneously partial oxidation and pyrolysis reactions of different 
organic compounds to added-value products. In particular, this 
invention relates to dual-flow chemical reactors containing catalytic 
heat-transfer walls which have both gas-impervious materials and 
suitable catalysts allowing oxidative coupling of methane into 
higher hydrocarbons, and chemical processes using dual-flow 
reactors having such catalytic heat-transfer walls to control and 
facilitate transport of heat from methane coupling reactions in a 
methane-containing gas stream to cracking reactions of organic 
compounds in separate gas stream. These dual-flow reactors 
comprise either an array of tubes containing channels for flow of 
one gas stream positioned in another gas stream flow or a core 
containing channels for separated flow of a methane-containing gas 
stream and flow of organic compounds in another gas stream. Each 
channel has a portion of thermally conductive wall disposed 
between at least two different gas streams comprising a gas-impervious 
material and suitable catalyst for oxidative coupling of 
methane into higher hydrocarbons. The invention includes reactors comprising first and second 
zones separated by catalytic heat-transfer walls which have both 
gas-impervious materials and suitable catalysts allowing oxidative 
coupling of methane into higher hydrocarbons. Preferred gas-impervious 
materials comprise high temperature metal alloys 
and/or non-metals materials including stainless steels, ceramics, 
silicon carbide, and the like.  The invention also includes a process for making olefins using 
a dual-flow reactor having catalytic heat-transfer walls to control 
and facilitate transport of heat from methane coupling reactions in a 
methane-containing gas stream to cracking reactions of organic 
compounds in another gas stream. This process combines the 
thermal and/or catalytic cracking of a hydrocarbon feed stock with 
the coupling of methane and allows separation of an enhanced 
amount of C₂+ products, and more particularly, to a process for 
making olefins in which a hydrocarbon feed is thermally cracked to 
form olefins in parallel with the catalytic coupling of methane to 
form largely C₂ hydrocarbons using an oxygen-affording gas, the 
methane
