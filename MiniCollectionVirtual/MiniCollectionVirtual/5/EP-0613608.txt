<DESCRIPTION>
The disclosed invention is directed generally to 
hybrid multilayer circuit structures, and is directed more 
particularly to hybrid multilayer circuit structures having 
integral electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding 
dielectric layers formed therein. Hybrid multilayer circuit structures, also known as 
hybrid microcircuits, implement the interconnection and 
packaging of discrete circuit devices, and generally 
include a unitized multilayer circuit structure formed from 
a plurality of integrally fused insulating layers (e.g., 
ceramic layers) having conductor traces disposed therebetween. 
The discrete circuit devices (e.g., integrated 
circuits) are commonly mounted on the top insulating layer 
so as not to be covered by another insulating layer or on 
an insulating layer having die cutouts formed thereon to 
provide cavities for the discrete devices. Passive components 
such as capacitors and resistors can be formed on the 
same layer that supports the discrete devices, for example, 
by thick film processes, or they can be formed between the 
insulating layers, for example, also by thick film processes. 
Electrical interconnection of the conductors and 
components on the different layers is achieved with vias or 
holes appropriately located and formed in the insulating  
 
layers and filled with conductive via fill material, 
whereby the conductive material is in contact with predetermined 
conductive traces between the layers that extend 
over or under the vias. A consideration with hybrid multilayer circuit structures 
is shielding and controlling electric fields which 
are generated internally to the hybrid multilayer circuit 
structure (for example by RF microstrip or stripline 
conductors), as well as for externally generated electric 
fields. Known techniques for controlling electric fields in 
hybrid multilayer circuit structures include circuit 
conductor separation, conductive shielding and/or packaging 
external to the multilayer circuit structure, and internal 
conductive ground planes. External shielding adds significant 
cost in typical applications. Moreover, the required 
isolation is not always readily achieved with conductive 
shields wherein ground/shield current flow can induce 
additional coupling. The problem becomes more difficult 
with RF power circuits. A major consideration with conductive shielding is 
that both the field and induced conductor currents must be 
considered in controlling internal and external interference 
and feedback. Any non-orthogonal interaction
