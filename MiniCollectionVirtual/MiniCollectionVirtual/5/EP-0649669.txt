<ABSTRACT>
An extinguishing composition is proposed which can be used both as a dry extinguisher and as an extinguishing additive in water. The principal constituents of the extinguishing composition are, on the one hand, pulverulent polymers which form hydrogels and, on the other hand, substances having a coarse surface structure and/or a capillary and/or fibrous structure. These principal constituents of the extinguishing composition can be mixed homogeneously to give a flowable composition.
