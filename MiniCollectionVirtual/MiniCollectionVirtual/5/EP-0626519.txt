<ABSTRACT>
A centrifugal fan (20) having an integral air flow 
measurement apparatus, the fan including an inlet cone (26) 

having a flared inlet (58) for receiving air and a flared 
outlet (60) for expelling air into the center of a rotating 

fan wheel (24). The cone (26) has a throat (72) having a minimum 
diameter, with apertures (76) defined within the throat (72) and 

in communication with a manometer (30). Apertures (78) in the 
face of the cone near the flared inlet (58) are connected to 

the manometer (30) to provide a pressure comparison between 
the face of the fan (20) and the narrowest portion of the 

throat (72). A controller monitors the pressure 
differential, calculates a flow rate based on known 

characteristics of the cone, and adjusts the fan speed 
to maintain the desired air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ventilation systems, 
and particularly to those for industrial applications, 
including those with centrifugal fans. Two important factors affect the design and 
performance of industrial ventilation systems: 
efficiency and precision flow measurement capability. 
Every system has a particular efficiency level that is a 
function of how readily air flows through the system. 
Each component of a system through which air flows 
presents a certain amount of resistance to air flow. 
This resistance is determined by the size and shape of 
the component, and by the nature of any obstacles or 
surfaces over which the air flows. Generally, 
components that are wider, smoother, straighter and 
shorter have less resistance to air flow, and therefore 
provide a more efficient system. Improved efficiency 
permits the use of a lower capacity fan to generate air 
flow in the system, and requires less energy to maintain 
a given flow. Consequently, improved efficiency can 
reduce equipment and operating costs. In many ventilation systems, it is advantageous 
to precisely measure the rate of air flow through the 
system. This ensures compliance with various codes and 
functional specifications, and is particularly important 
in specialized applications such as clean room 
ventilation systems. Systems without precise flow 
measuring capability must be overdesigned with excess 
capacity, and operated at excess levels to ensure 
compliance with operating specifications. In addition, 
filters used in some systems become more resistant to 
air flow as they become clogged with particles over 
time. Thus, fan speed must be increased to maintain the 
specified air flow. This capability requires precise 
measurements to indicate what adjustments are needed. It is possible to characterize the air flow 
performance qualities of individual system components  
 
such as fans. Such a characterization would provide a 
set of curves, each indicating the rate of air flow 
through the fan as a function of the load or air flow 
resistance upon which the fan is acting, given a 
particular rate of fan rotation. As the fan rotation 
rate is changed, a different characterization curve must 
be applied to determine the rate of air flow through the 
fan. Alternatively, the curve may represent flow rate 
as a function of rotation under a constant load. While 
such laboratory characterization may be feasible for 
certain individual off-the-shelf components such as 
fans, it is impractical to characterize entire 
ventilat
