<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved 
hot-melt-coatable pressure-sensitive adhesive for use 
in adhering to low surface energy substrates and 
nonwovens. More specifically, the invention relates to 
a pressure-sensitive adhesive composition which 
provides superior adhesion characteristics when used 
against a polyethylene film or a nonwoven such as are 
used in typical diaper constructions. U.S. Patent No. 3,787,531 (Dahlquist) 
relates to a tacky pressure-sensitive adhesive 
described as having excellent shear strength and creep 
resistance at elevated temperatures. Dahlquist teaches 
that the use of tapered diblock elastomers produce 
adhesives that are useless for commercial 
pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes due to their 
tendencies to fail cohesively, specifically mentioning 
styrene-butadiene copolymers such as Solprene™ 1205, a 
tapered diblock copolymer. As a method of improving 
adhesive performance, Dahlquist proposes the use of 
pure diblock copolymers where there is no intermingling 
of monomers from one block in the block of the other 
monomer, such as in a tapered block copolymer. The 
exemplified adhesives are comprised predominately of 
A-B diblock copolymers of polyisoprene or polybutadiene 
elastomeric blocks tackified with solid tackifying 
resins, such as Piccolyte S-115 for the polyisoprene-based 
diblock adhesives and an alpha polyterpene 
tackifier for the polybutadiene-based diblock 
adhesives. The polymers obtained are described as 
having excellent adhesive properties, particularly high 
shear strength without the necessity of chemical crosslinking,  
 
however, these properties were determined 
against a conventional stainless steel substrate. Other patents dealing with pressure-sensitive 
adhesives using A-B diblock copolymers with butadiene 
elastomeric blocks, particularly Solprene™ 1205, 
include U.S. Patent No. 3,519,585 which describes an 
adhesive composition comprising 50-95 parts solid wood 
rosin, 50-95 parts of a styrene-butadiene diblock 
copolymer with correspondingly 10-50 parts of a 
styrene-butadiene triblock copolymer. When triblock 
was used alone, adhesives allegedly demonstrated poor 
tack strength, but had good shear strength. U.S. 
Patent No. 3,592,710 describes an extrudable hot-melt 
adhesive composition comprised of an admixture of 
Solprene™ 1205, Kraton™ 1101 and a solid resin 
Pentalyn™ H. The exemplified adhesive comprises 70 
parts Solprene™ 1205, 30 parts Kraton™ 1101 and 85 
parts Pentalyn™ H. The adhesive allegedly displays 
good adhesion
