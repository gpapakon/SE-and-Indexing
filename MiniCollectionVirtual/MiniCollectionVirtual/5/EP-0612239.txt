<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing 
a dental amalgam that is devoid of harmful free 
mercury, to be used as a filler for dental cavities 
and in particular the invention relates to processes 
by which two separate compositions characterised as 
treated silver and silver-mercury compound are formed 
which are then used in a mixture with mercury to form 
the dental amalgam. Compositions for filling dental cavities 
presently available usually comprises of dental 
alloys mixed with mercury. The dental alloys include 
at least three metals. A typical alloy would include 
Silver, Tin and Copper. Small percentages of one or 
more additional metals like Zinc, Indium, Palladium 
and the like metals may be added. These dental 
alloys are available either in fine powder or as 
tablets (i.e. compressed powder). The dental alloy 
is mixed with mercury to form a putty or plastic mass 
known as amalgam which is packed into a tooth cavity 
as a filling. Among the three metals, namely Silver, 
Tin and Copper, Silver is the only metal used in 
dental alloys that can completely react with mercury 
to form a silver-mercury compound or silver amalgam. Recently research scientists have established 
that there is "free" mercury i.e. unreacted mercury 
present within the amalgam fillings in the mouth. 
The free mercury can vapourise in the mouth from the 
fillings due to the higher temperatures experienced 
in the mouth. The mercury vapour can be inhaled into 
the lungs, where it is absorbed into the 
bloodstream. Studies have shown deposits of mercury 
in brain and kidney tissues that have originated from 
such fillings. Mercury also causes bleeding gums and  
 
skin reactions. This "free" mercury has contributed to various 
medical problems as well as in certain patients, 
hypersensitivity reactions. In fact, in recent 
times, dental experts in Sweden have recommended to 
the authorities to ban the use of such "amalgams" in 
pregnant women to prevent genetic damage to the 
foetus as there is evidence to show that "free" 
mercury from the mother can via the transplacental 
route, affect the foetus. A lesser problem in the use of conventional 
dental alloy amalgams is the chemical corrosion 
caused in the oral cavity. As tin and copper are 
prone to corrosion, the corrosion process continues 
in the mouth throughout the relatively short span of 
the life of the fillings. In another aspect of the history of amalgam in 
dental fillings, silver fillings were mixed with 
mercury to form a putty which was filled into

<CLAIMS>
A process for making dental amalgam for use as a 
dental filler characterised by the preparation of a 

mixture comprising a treated silver composition and a 
silver-mercury compound, and combining said mixture 

with mercury to form a dental amalgam that is devoid 
of harmful free mercury, in which the treated silver 

composition is prepared from metallic silver and tin 
of high purity by the steps of forming a homogenous 

alloy of silver and tin, reducing the alloy to form a 
fine powder, reacting said powder with hydrochloric 

acid to remove the dissolved tin from the alloy 
thereby leaving solid particles of treated silver in 

the acid solution, the process of hydrochloric acid 
treatment being carried out several times on the solid 

particles until there is a noticeable colour change in 
the solid particles from a dark grey to a yellowish 

brown colour, filtering the yellowish brown solid 
particles and washing them several times with warm 

water to remove all traces of the acid, and drying the 
particles to form the treated silver composition; said 

silver mercury compound being prepared from granules 
of metallic silver of high purity and mercury by the 

steps of reacting either a mixture of the granules and 
the mercury with nitric acid to form a nitrate 

solution, or reacting the silver granules and mercury 
separately with nitric acid each to form separate 

solutions, which two solutions are subsequently mixed 
to form a combined nitrate solution, diluting the 

nitrate solution by adding water, and introducing 
metallic copper of high purity which results in 

precipitation of a silver-mercury precipitate, which 
is filtered and washed several times with warm water 

to remove traces of acid and is then dried to result 
in the silver-mercury compound.  

 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the silver and tin are mixed in the range of 

percentage ratios between 60%:40% and 80%:20% by 
weight respectively to form the silver and tin alloy. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, characterised 
in that the silver and tin are mixed preferably in 

the ratio of 72%:28% by weight respectively. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the weights of silver and 

mercury are in the range of ratios between 1:1 to 
1:2.2 by weight respectively before they are reacted 

with the nitric acid. 
A process as claimed in claim 4, characterised 
in that the weights of silver and mercury are in the 

ratio of 1:1.9 by weight before they are reacted with 
the nitric acid. 
A process as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the 

composition of treated silver and the composition of 
silver-mercury are mixed in the range of percentage 

ratios between 80%:20% to 50%:50% by weight. 
A process as claimed in claim 6, characterised 
in that the treated silver composition and the 

silver-mercury composition are mixed preferably in 
the percentage ratio of 55%:45% by weight.  

 
A process as claimed in any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the mixture of the 

treated silver composition and the silver-mercury 
compound is mixed with mercury in the range of ratios 

between 1:1.18 to 1:1.4 by weight, to form the dental 
amalgam. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterised in 
that the mixture of the treated silver composition and 

the silver-mercury compound is mixed with mercury 
preferably in the ratio of 1:1.18 by weight

A dental amalgam for filling a dental cavity 
characterised in that it is obtainable by the process 

claimed in any one of the preceding claims.
