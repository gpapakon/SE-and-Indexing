<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming
apparatus such as an electrophotographic type analog
copying machine, a digital copying machine, a color
copying machine, a printer or a page printer.The speedup of the image forming speed in an
electrophotographic type image forming apparatus has
heretofore been carried out by effecting, in addition
to the supply and conveyance of a transfer material,
all of a series of operations such as image forming
processes, i.e., latent image formation, development,
the transfer of a toner image to the transfer material
(e.g. a transfer sheet or the like) and further,
fixing, at a high speed. For example, to realize an
apparatus capable of forming 60 sheets of images per
minute, relative to an apparatus capable of forming 30
sheets of images per minute, there has been adopted a
construction in which in addition to the supply and
conveyance of the transfer material, image forming
processes are carried out with a driving speed
necessary threfor set to double.In the above-described example of the prior art, 
however, in order to realize high-speed image formtion,
with the speedup of the sheet supply speed of transfer
material supplying means for successively drawing out
transfer materials supported on transfer material
supporting means (e.g. a sheet supply cassette or the
like), it has been necessary to provide inter-sheet
taking into account a reduction in the accuracy of the
interval between transfer materials during the
continuous supply of the transfer materials, i.e., the
inter-sheet interval (hereinafter referred to as the
inter-sheet). Also, in addition to the conveyance of
the transfer materials, it has been required to speedup
the image forming processes and a large-scaled
investigation has been required.Thus, for example, in the latent image formation
in the image forming processes, in a digital image
forming apparatus, it is necessary to operate the image
processing and latent image forming means thereof such
as a laser at a high speed, and for example, when
development is to be made from an apparatus capable of
forming 30 sheets of images per minute to an apparatus
capable of forming 60 sheets of images per minute, an
image processing portion or the like of which the image
clock frequency is doubled has been required. Also, in
an analog image forming apparatus, it has been
necessary to double the driving speed of an original
scanner for scanning (reading-scanning) an original to  
be copied.Further, in both of the digital and analog image
forming apparatuses,
