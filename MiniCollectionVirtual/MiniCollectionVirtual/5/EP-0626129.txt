<ABSTRACT>
A construction for milking animals comprises one or 
more milking units (1) which are connected to a supply line 

(2) leading to a milk tank (3). There is further provided a 
rinsing fluid reservoir (14) from which a rinsing fluid can 

be passed through at least a portion of a milking unit (1) 
and the supply line (2). Incorporated in the end portion of 

the supply line (2) near the milk tank (3) there is a three-way 
valve (13) to which is connected a rinsing fluid discharge 

line (15) which is fed back to the rinsing fluid 
reservoir (14). When this three-way valve (13) has been 

adjusted to a first position, milk obtained with the aid of a 
milking unit (1) can be transferred to the milk tank (3), 

whilst, when the three-way valve (13) has been adjusted to a 
second position, a rinsing fluid ring line system is established. 

The milk tank (3) then does not form part of this 
ring line system and can be cleaned separately.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a construction
for milking animals,
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such a construction is known from EP-A-0 385
539.The invention has for its object to provide an alternative
cleaning system as described above. According to the
invention, the above-described construction for milking
animals is characterized by the features of the characterizing part of claim 1.When, after
milking or after cleaning a change is made to cleaning
or milking, then all the milk or rinsing fluid, respectively,
must be removed from the supply line. By means of the
air inlet valve incorporated preferably in that point of the
supply line that is substantially most remote from the
milk tank, the supply line can be emptied.The three-way valve in the supply line end near
the milk tank can be operated by a signal produced by a
computer. The use of a computer for this purpose is particularly
easy when this computer is already present,
which is the case when, in accordance with the invention,
the milking unit operates automatically and co-operates
with an animal identification system, whilst the
computer of the automatic milking unit and/or of the animal
identification system supplies signals for controlling
the milking and cleaning procedure and consequently
also for the said three-way valve provided at the end of
the supply line. The construction, in which the valve is
switched by a computer, can advantageously be used in
such an automatically operating milking, system, a milking
unit then more In particular having a robot for automatically
connecting the teat cups to the teats of an
animal to be milked. Such a robotization in particular
renders it possible to have the entire milking and cleaning
procedure proceed without any action on the part at
the farmer.For a better understanding of the invention and
to show how the same may be carried into effect, it will
now be described in greater detail with reference to the
accompanying drawing, which schematically shows the
construction for milking animals in accordance with the
invention. Before giving this description, it can be noted
that it is known that each of the milking units comprises
in customary manner four teat cups which can be connected
to the teats of an animal to be milked and a milk
meter in which the milk obtained with the aid of the teat
cups is collected, whereafter the milk is pumped from
the milk meter by means of a pump into said supply line
and from there to the milk tank. On cleansing of the milk
unit and more specifically of

<CLAIMS>
A construction for milking animals, comprising one
or more milking units (1) connected to a supply line

(2) leading to a milk tank (3), as well as a rinsing
fluid reservoir (14) from which a rinsing fluid can be

passed through at least a portion of a milking unit
(1) and the supply line (2), while a three-way valve

(13) is incorporated in the end portion of the supply
line (2) near the milk tank (3), and a rinsing fluid discharge

line (15) connected to said valve (13) can
return the rinsing fluid to the rinsing fluid reservoir

(14) said
three-way valve (13) being adjustable into a

first position wherein milk obtained by means of a
milking unit (1) can be transferred to the milk tank

(3) and into a second position wherein a rinsing
fluid ring line system is established 
characterized in that
 the rinsing fluid ring line
system is formed by the rinsing fluid reservoir (14),

a line (18) which extends from the reservoir (14)
and is provided with a valve (17) and which leads to

the upper end of a milk meter (6) constituted by a collecting glass, the milk meter
(6) itself, the line section in which a pump (11) is

incorporated and the supply (2) and rinsing fluid
discharge (15) line and


in that
 there is incorporated in the supply line (2) an
air inlet valve (22) for the purpose of removing milk

or rinsing fluid therefrom.
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the air inlet valve (22) is incorporated in the
supply line (2) near that point of connection of the

milking unit (1) to the supply line (2) that is most
remote from the milk tank (3).
A construction as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
in that
 a milking unit (1) includes teat cups (4)
which can be connected to the teats of an animal to

be milked, and the milk meter (6), via which the milk
obtained with the aid of the teat cups (14) is fed into

the supply line (2).
A construction as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the rinsing fluid ring line system between the
rinsing fluid reservoir (14) and the milk meter (16)

includes a by-pass line (19) which is equipped,
arranged one after the other, with a valve (20), a

cassette (21) with spraying means for cleaning the
interior side of the teat cups (4), and the teat cups

(4) themselves.
A construction as claimed in claim 3 or 4, 
characterized
in that
 by means of the pump (11) during milking
milk is transferred from the milk meter (6) to the

milk tank (3), and during cleaning of the milk unit a
rinsing fluid is circulated through the rinsing fluid

ring line system.
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the valves (13, 17,
20, 22) are controlled by a computer (9).
A construction as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims,
