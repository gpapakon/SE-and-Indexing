<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method in the regulation of the
headbox of a paper/board machine according to the preamble
of claim 1. Furthermore, the invention relates to a device
in the regulation of the headbox according to the preamble
of claim 10.From the EP-A-0 462 472 a device in a regulation of the
headbox is known which forms the basis for the preambles of
the new independent claims 1 and 10. The headbox comprises
an intermediate chamber from which a pulp suspension flow
is passed into turbulence tubes of a turbulence generator.
After the pulp suspension flow has been passed from the
turbulence tubes into the discharge duct, the pulp
suspension-flow is combined with an additional component
flow.From the document DE 42 39 845 A1 a paper machine is known.
The density of the pulp suspension flow supplied into the
headbox of the paper machine is determined by combining two
component flows.From the document WO 8601844 A a headbox system for a paper
machine is known. In the headbox system the pulp
suspensions flow is so controlled that in the event of a
change on the pulp distribution over the width of the web
of the web the horizontal component of the flow direction
in a delivery gap remains, at all places, always in the
direction of the machine.As is known from the prior art, the discharge flow of the pulp suspension out of the
headbox must be of uniform velocity in the transverse direction of the paper/board
machine. A transverse flow, which produces distortion of the fibre orientation,
affects the quality factors of the paper produced, such as anisotropy of strength and
stretch. The level and variation of anisotropy in the transverse direction also affect
the printing properties of the paper. In particular, it is an important requirement that
the main axes of the directional distribution, i.e. orientation, of the fibre mesh in the
paper coincide with the directions of the main axes of the paper and that the
orientation is symmetric in relation to these axes.At the edges of the pulp-flow duct in the headbox, a smaller amount of pulp flows.
This edge effect produces a very strong linear distortion in the profile. Profile faults
in the turbulence generator of the headbox usually produce a non-linear distortion in
the profile inside the lateral areas of the flow ducts.Attempts are made to compensate for an unevenness of the grammage profile arising
from the drying-shrinkage of paper by means of a crown formation of the slice, so
that the slice is thicker in the middle of the pulp jet. When the paper web
