<ABSTRACT>
A programmable reference used to identify a state of 
an array cell in a multi-density or low voltage supply 

flash EEPROM memory array. The programmable reference 
includes one or more reference cells, each reference 

cell having a floating gate which is programmed to 
control its threshold value. The array cells are read 

by applying an identical voltage to the gate of the 
array cell and the reference cell and comparing outputs 

to determine the array cell state. During read of an 
array cell, the programmable reference cell is biased 

the same as the array cell, so that the difference in 
threshold values between reference cells and array cells 

remain constant with a change in V
cc
. Circuitry is 
included for programming the reference cells utilizing 

a simple resistor ratio. Programming is performed at 
test time, preferably by the manufacturer, to assure V
cc
 
remains within strict tolerances. The array cells are 

programmed and read without resistor biasing and under 
looser tolerances using the reference cells at a later 

time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a
reference means for memory arrays, and more
particularly to a reference means which may be utilized to
determine the thresholds of flash electrically erasable
programmable read only memory (EEPROM) cells utilized in
low voltage supply and multi-density memory arrays.One traditional referencing scheme utilized to
determine the threshold of a memory cell includes an
unprogrammed reference cell coupled with a sense ratio.
Fig. 1 shows such a reference cell 100 coupled with a
sense ratio to provide a reference for an array cell
102. The sense ratio is provided by two parallel
resistive elements 112 and 114, having the same value R
connected between VCC and the drain of array cell 100,
and an additional resistive element 116, of value R,
connected between VCC and the drain of array cell 102.
The drain of reference cell 100 provides a reference
output to one input of comparator 104. The drain of
array cell 102 provides an array cell output to a second
input of comparator 104. The output of comparator 104
indicates the threshold state of array cell 102.To read the states of the array cell 102 in Fig. 1,
VCC is applied to the gates of reference cell 100 and
array cell 102. When VCC is applied, the sense ratio
will vary the voltage seen by comparator 104 at the 
drain of reference cell 100 as compared to the drain of
array cell 102. The voltage seen by comparator 104 at
the drain of reference cell 100 is, thus, VCC-1/2RID,
whereas the voltage seen by the comparator at the drain
of array cell 102 is VCC-IDR. ID is controlled by the
thresholds, vt, of the reference cell 100 and array cell
102 as seen by the saturation equation for a MOS
transistor ID = K(vGS - vt)2, where vGS here is equal to
VCC. With both the reference cell 100 and array cell 102
unprogrammed, or having an identical threshold vt, the
sense ratio will provide a higher voltage at the
reference output to comparator 104 than the array cell
output causing comparator 104 to output a first state.
With the array cell programmed to have a threshold
raised to a certain level, ID for the array cell will be
reduced and the voltage of the array cell output will
rise above the voltage at the reference cell output
causing comparator 104 to output a second state.Because the sense ratio method utilizes differing
resistor ratios connected to the drains of the reference
cell and the array cell, the sense ratio method provides
a reference output varying with respect to an array cell
output due to temperature and process
