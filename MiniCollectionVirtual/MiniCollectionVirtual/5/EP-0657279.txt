<ABSTRACT>
A stretchable, drapable, windproof, water resistant and 
water vapor permeable composite fabric including an inner layer of 

fabric, a first adhesive layer, a non-porous hydrophilic barrier 
layer, a second adhesive layer and an outer layer of fabric. At 

least one of the adhesive layers is of a hydrophilic material and 
may be continuous, and which joins the inner fabric layer to one 

side of the barrier layer, the second adhesive layer adhering the 
barrier layer to the outer fabric layer. The adhesive layers and 

the barrier layer are constructed to allow water vapor molecules to 
travel therethrough by a process of absorption-diffusion-desorption, 

but restrict the passage of wind and liquid water. The inner layer 
is formed of a hydrophobic material rendered sufficiently 

hydrophilic to permit wicking or formed with an inner surface formed 
of said material and an outer surface formed of a naturally 

absorbent material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent 
application Serial No. 08/009,153 filed January 26, 1993 entitled 
COMPOSITE FABRIC WITH BARRIER LAYER, which is a continuation of U.S. 
patent application Serial No. 07/788,913 filed on November 7, 1991 
entitled WINDPROOF AND WATER RESISTANT COMPOSITE FABRIC WITH BARRIER 
LAYER, now U.S. Patent No. 5,204,156, which is a continuation-in-part 
of U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/468,027 filed on 
January 22, 1990 and entitled DRAPABLE, WATER VAPOR PERMEABLE, WIND 
AND WATER RESISTANT COMPOSITE FABRIC AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME, now 
U.S. Patent No. 5,126,182, which itself is a continuation-in-part of 
U.S. patent application Serial No. 07/422,850 filed on October 17, 
1989 entitled PRINTED FLOCKED FABRIC, now abandoned. This invention relates generally to a clothing material 
and, in particular to a drapable, stretchable, windproof and water 
resistant, water vapor permeable, composite fabric that can be used 
as outerwear. Treatments to render fabrics wind and water resistant have 
been known for many years. However, it has been difficult to create 
fabrics which are suitable for apparel use and which are windproof, 
water resistant and water vapor permeable. It has also been 
difficult to create fabrics that are both water vapor permeable and 
wind resistant. In particular, it has been difficult to create a 
soft, stretchable, drapable, breathable, wind and water resistant 
fabric. Conventional double-faced raised surface knit fabrics are 
porous and thus are not effective in sheltering the wearer from 
wind. In the past, a rubber layer has been adhered to a fabric  
 
substrate to impart wind and waterproof qualities and the exposed 
surface of the rubber layer was flocked. Foamed adhesives have been used to adhere layers of flock 
in upholstery fabrics. These fabrics, however, have generally been 
formed using an open weave fabric, such as osnaburg, as a fabric 
substrate and do not have the degree of stretchability and 
drapability required for apparel fabrics. Previously, a drapable, windproof, water resistant and 
water vapor permeable composite fabric has been formed by dispersing 
a thin layer of foamed adhesive between a fabric substrate and a 
layer of flocked fibers. The pores of the foamed adhesive are 
formed to be large enough to allow water vapor molecules to pass 
through, but are too small to allow air or liquid water molecules to 
pass through, except under pressure. This construction can render 
the fabric wind and water
