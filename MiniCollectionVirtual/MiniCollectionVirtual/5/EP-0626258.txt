<ABSTRACT>
A printing or marking apparatus (20) comprises a movable 
marking member (26) having at least one marking device 

thereon, and a stationary heating structure (170) having at 
least one heating element for maintaining the marking 

device (26) at an elevated temperature. At least a portion 
of the stationary heating structure (170) can be exchanged, 

removed or modified in order to vary the amount of heat 
applied to the marking device (26). In a preferred 

embodiment, the removable portion comprises a tubular heat 
pipe (184) which extends into a hollow marking roll (26), 

and the heat pipe may be provided in different sizes or in 
segments which can be added or removed as desired. The 

disclosed apparatus (20) is of particular utility in 
connection with ink compositions of the type which are 

solid at normal room temperatures, and which are rendered 
liquid or flowable at elevated temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printing or marking 
apparatus, and is particularly concerned with heated 
printing or marking apparatus in which at least a portion 
of the heating structure can be exchanged, removed or 
modified in order to control the temperature of the 
printing or marking element. Product marking or coding operations are often carried 
out using thermoplastic ink compositions of the type which 
are solid at normal room temperatures, and which are 
rendered liquid or flowable at elevated temperatures. The 
ink composition must be kept heated while printing, but 
quickly cools and solidifies after it is applied so that 
the printed surface can be handled immediately without 
smearing the printed image. The ink supply is normally 
provided in the form of a porous ink roll that is 
impregnated with a thermoplastic ink composition of the 
type described, and these rolls are convenient to handle 
and store when the ink is in the solid state. Common types 
of product marking operations in which ink compositions of 
this type are used include date coding, lot or batch 
numbering, and the like. In general, the object is to 
print some type of variable information on products or 
product wrappers, using a very simple type of marking or 
coding apparatus which can be installed on an existing 
conveyor system. U.S. Patent No. 4,559,872, issued to Andrew G. Perra, 
Jr. on December 24, 1985 and assigned to the assignee of 
the present invention, discloses a printing apparatus which 
utilizes a hot-melt ink composition for product marking or 
coding operations. The disclosed apparatus comprises a 
porous inking roll of the type described previously, an 
adjacent printing roll carrying one or more printing  
 
elements to which the ink is applied, and a stationary 
heater block containing a number of electrical heating 
elements for heating the inking roll and printing elements. 
The heater block is generally in the form of an inverted 
"U", with its closed end surrounding the inking roll and 
its open end partially surrounding the printing member. By 
heating both the inking roll and printing elements from the 
stationary heater block, a very simple and reliable 
printing apparatus is obtained. Prior arrangements 
employed ring and brush assemblies to conduct electrical 
current to heating elements within the rotating printing 
roll or type holder, and this led to undesirable complexity 
and component failure. Although the apparatus described in U.S. Patent No. 
4,559,872 has proved useful in
