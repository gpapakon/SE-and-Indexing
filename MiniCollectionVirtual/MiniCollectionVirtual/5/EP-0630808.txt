<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns the field of aircraft engine construction, and more specifically the development of new aircraft. 
The aim of the invention is to develop new aircraft for non-stop long-haul flights with the same cargo carrying capacity, and 

also to solve the problems associated with extending the functional characteristics of existing aircraft. The aircraft comprises a 
fuselage (1), a suspended unit (6) attached to it and consisting of auxiliary fuel tanks (7), an auxiliary engine system (8), an 

undercarriage (4) and an auxiliary undercarriage (18) underneath the suspended unit (6). The suspended unit (6) can be 
attached to the fuselage (1) by an articulation (5) or with the aid of panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to aviation engineering of transportation and 
technological purpose and is aimed at carrying large-size cargoes, as well 
as erection, agricultural, fire-fighting,and some other operations. Known in the art is an airborne vehicle for long-distance non-stop flights 
at supersonic flight speeds,said vehicle comprising a fuselage , a wing 
with a hinge joint for tilting the wing outboard panel in a horizontal plane , 
a gas-turbine power plant,mounted on the tailplane, a landing gear , and 
flight controls. The heretofore-known airborne vehicle Boeing 2707 has been 
developed by the Boeing Co. ( cf. the journal "Technical information", 
Bureau of Technical Information under the Central-Hydrodynamic 
Institute, No.15, 1967, pp. 11-29 (in Russian). However, the known technical solutions fails to reduce the operational 
expenses of such an airborne vehicle with a gas-turbine power plant 
operating on a hydrocarbon fuel for double-increased or more distances of 
the so-called "flight-range parameter" MIK, where M stands for the Mach 
number , I means the specific impulse of the power plant, and K indicates 
the L/D ratio, said parameter being used for assessing the efficiency of an  
 
airborne vehicle, while the value of said parameter is inversely 
proportional to the airborne vehicle operational costs (c.f. "Hypersonic 
transport aircraft" by Ya.N.Gaukman, Transport PH, 1967, pp. 17-22 (in 
Russian)
 
   Another airborne vehicle for long-distance port-stop flights at 
supersonic speeds is known to comprise a fuselage,a wing with a hinge 
joint for tilting the outboard wing panel in a horizontal plane, an underwing 
hydrocarbon-fuel fired power plant, a landing gear, and flight controls (cf. 
B.Sweetmann and G.Warwick "Blackjack: Soviet B-1 or better?", journal 
Flight International, No.12, 1982, pp.1700 - 1704). The aforementioned known technical solution, however, also fails to 
reduce the vehicle operational costs with an increased range of a non-stop 
flight and specified payload due to a low value of the "flight range 
parameter" MIK applied in the Ya.N.Gaukhman's technique for assessing 
the efficiency of an airborne vehicle. The present invention has for its object to provide a longer flying range 
with the specified payload at reduced operational costs of an airborne 
vehicle. As far as the vehicle construction is concerned, the foregoing object is 
accomplished due to the fact that the airborne vehicle comprises a 
fuselage, an underwing hydrocarbon-fuel fired power plant, a

vertical plane passing through the fuselage center line; a ramjet engine of 
the additional power plant is interposed between the front and rear 

openings of the suspension unit, said engine operating on, e.g., hydrogen
