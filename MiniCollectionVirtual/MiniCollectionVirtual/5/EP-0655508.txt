<ABSTRACT>
In the production of stainless steels in electric arc furnaces, it is 
possible to use foamed slag, with great advantages, by using a metal charge 

with specific carbon and silicon contents, by insuflating limestone and 
carbon, by controlling the amount of employed oxygen and by maintaining 

basicity index of the slag within the range of 1,4 to 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for using foamed slag in
stainless steels production and more specifically concerns the
reduction of consumption of power, of furnace refractory wall
and of the electrodes, as well as the output increase and
the production optimization by means of using foamed slag.In steel production with electric furnace, the furnace itself is
filled up with metal scrap of suitable composition, the electrodes
are lowered and the electric current starts to flow. The scrap just
below the electrodes is melted first and the electrodes are lowered
accordingly. When the electrodes are in their standard working
position a great amount of not yet molten metal surrounds them,
interposing between them and the furnace walls, which are thus
sheltered from the radiation of arcs, which are at a temperature
ranging between 6,000 and 10,000Â°C, a temperature much higher than
the one the refractory material constituting the walls of the
furnace can resist to.However, when a large amount of scrap is molten, the walls are no
longer sheltered and are thus exposed to the destroying action of
the radiation of arcs.Such drawback was traditionally amended by reducing the furnished
electric power, by lowering the voltage to the electrodes and by 
shortening the length of the electric arcs, which thus were, at
least partially, sheltered by the slag thickness, which is naturally
present on the surface of the metallic molten bath. Such action
saves the refractory but lengthens the treating times in the furnace
and increases the electrodes and energy consuption.In the production of carbon steels with electric furnace it has
been introduced since a long time the use of the so called foamed
slag by introducing carbon or coke in the slag onto the bath and
oxygen in the bath itself: the first reduces iron oxide to iron,
thus producing carbon oxide, while oxygen reacts with the carbon in
the bath thus forming further carbon oxide. Such a gas, by bubbling
through the slag layer, make it foam, thus largely increasing its
volume. The foamed slag envelops the electrodes and interposes
between the electric arcs and the walls of the furnace.It is thus possible to keep the arc power to maximum values by using
very high voltage with lower currents and longer arcs, with a
consequent increase of furnace output, lower thermic losses, lower
consumption of electrodes and electric power.However, the technique of the foamed slag did find little
application in stainless steels production, essentially because
