<ABSTRACT>
An antacid composition capable of forming a floating 
gelatinous mass when contacted with aqueous acid and 

consisting essentially of, as active ingredients, xanthan gum; 
an effective acid-neutralizing amount of hexitol-stabilized 

aluminum hydroxide and a gas-producing material capable of 
producing a non-toxic gas when contacted with aqueous acid, 

which may be formulated as a solid, powder, tablet or 
suspension is described, together with its use for the 

treatment of hyperacidity and for the treatment of gastric 
reflux in a mammal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical 
compositions and particularly to compositions for use in 
treating gastroesophageal and gastrointestinal irritations. Esophageal pain, commonly referred to as heartburn, is 
symptomatic of gastric reflux. Gastric reflux occurs when 
small amounts of gastric juice and/or bile acids pass into the 
lower part of the esophagus and cause esophageal irritation. 
Typically, gastric reflux, which occurs after meals, especially 
large meals, is aggravated by bending over or lying down, and 
is a common occurrence in patients having a hiatal hernia, or a 
weakening of the esophageal sphincter. Severe episodes of 
gastric reflux may inflame the esophageal mucosa and lead to 
the more serious condition of reflux esophagitis in which 
severe damage or loss of squamous epithelium of the lower 
part of the esophagus may occur. The invention relates to raft-forming preparations which 
are employed for the treatment and alleviation of painful 
conditions resulting from the reflux of gastric acid and bile 
into the esophagus, comprising aluminum hydroxide, xanthan 
gum and bicarbonate or carbonate, as the antacid and raft-forming 
components. Basic metal salts and their use in antacid compositions 
are known in the art. Examples of metals known to form basic 
salts are alkali or alkaline earth metals and aluminum. The 
most commonly employed aluminum salts are the hydroxide, 
carbonate or phosphate. Examples of alkaline earth metals 
such as calcium are known; the use of calcium carbonate as an 
antacid either alone or in combination with other metal salts, 
such as magnesium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide is 
known. The use of alkali metals, such as sodium in sodium 
bicarbonate is known in antacid compositions.  
 An approach to the problem of gastric reflux comprises 
the administration of a preparation which forms a gelatinous 
foam or raft which floats on the stomach contents. The foam-containing 
antacid precedes the stomach contents into the 
esophagus when reflux occurs and helps to protect the mucosa 
from further irritation. The gelatinous foam is formed by the 
combination of an acid-insoluble gelatinous material 
entrapping carbon dioxide gas. The present invention relates 
to improvements in formulation of preparations which are 
capable of forming such foams. Antacid compositions which contain a gel-forming agent 
and an acid neutralizing agent are known (N. Washington et al., 
Int. J. Pharm. 27, 1985, pp. 279-286 and N. Washington et al., 
Int. J. Pharm.
