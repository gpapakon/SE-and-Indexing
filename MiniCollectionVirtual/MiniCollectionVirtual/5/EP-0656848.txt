<ABSTRACT>
Method and device for control within a line network such as a tram line, of a number of rolling units in various line runnings, and a method for installation of said device. A number of passive position determination elements (9) such as transponders, arranged for radio scanning, are located at determined positions in the network. Control equipment (2) on board said rolling units is provided with devices (8) for scanning of the position determination elements (9) and with sensors (6) for measurement of distance travelled. The momentary unit position within the line network is determined by continuous measurement of distance travelled and by calibration of the thereby obtained position determination by scanning of successively passed position determination elements (9). Data on the design and topography of the line network is stored in a central equipment (1) and communication from the mobile units stating their positions is received in a data processing unit (4). The vehicle control is performed by transmission from the central equipment (1) to each mobile equipment (2) of control data, based on the individual position relative to that of other rolling units, said control data comprising allowed minimum distance to the nearest other rolling unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
METHOD TO CONTROL IN A TRACK TRAFFIC SYSTEM MOVING UNITS, DEVICE FOR EFFECTING OF SUCH CONTROL AND PROCESS FOR INSTALLATION OF THE DEVICE.TECHNICAL FIELD: The present invention relates to a method for controlling vehicles in a line network, a device for such vehicle control and a method of installing said device in a line network. The invention hereby primarily relates to line networks of the tramway type, which are characterized by an extensive network with a large number of branchings and crossings and in most cases by traffic together with other, not track-bound road-users. In such cases the line network is synonymous with a track installation, which however does not exclude the invention from being applied to other lines along which vehicles are intended to move in a bound motion, with the aid of, as alternatives to tracks, rails, steering girders, control cables, etc. The device thereby comprises devices within the line network in the shape of central, fixed units as well as mobile units on board the respective vehicles.STATE OF THE ARTControl devices and control systems in line networks may have many duties. The original and most important one is to prevent collisions between vehicles moving in the network. For this purpose it is known since a long time ago to divide the line into zones and to prevent, by central control, any mobile unit from entering into a zone unless said zone is free from any other units. This system may be suitable for less dense traffic, such as railways. The system is however not suitable for use within tramway networks, where the traffic has to be dense and where the zones would thus have to be diminished into too short lengths, leading to major investment and control cost. 

The Swedish patent No 334 912 (C. Jauquet) discloses such a division of the line into zones. Furthermore, a calculation of the movement within the zone by means of message to a central unit from the mobile unit about it's speed is suggested, making a distance calculation based on speed x time possible. Hereby, the speed may be centrally controlled if a collision risk occurs. By being able in this way to determine, at least approximately, the position within the zone of each unit, several units may be allowed into the same zone on the condition that the central surveillance unit as well as the communication with said unit functions. By this method of calculating the unit positions, the position determinations obtained are however so uncertain, that either the zones must be made very small, so that the
