<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to thermal mass 
transfer donor elements and particularly to thermal 

mass transfer donor elements which provide a metallic 
appearing image upon thermal transfer. 
A thermal mass transfer donor element is described comprising a 
carrier layer having on one surface thereof a mass transferable layer of 

thermoplastic organic polymeric binder and mental flakes, said metal 
flakes having an average ratio of length to thickness of greater than 

20:1. 
A process for forming a thermal mass transfer donor element which can 
provide a metal image is also described comprising the steps of: 


a) Providing a coating solution comprising a solvent, metal flakes 
having an average ratio of length to thickness of at least 20:1, and a 

thermoplastic binder, 
b) coating said solution onto one surface of a carrier layer, and 
c) drying said solution to form a layer of metal flakes and binder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal mass 
transfer donor elements and particularly to thermal 
mass transfer donor elements which provide a metallic 
appearing image upon thermal transfer. Thermal mass transfer imaging processes are 
finding increasing application in the marketplace and 
provide environmentally sound, dry imaged processes. A 
thermal mass transfer donor sheet is placed in contact 
with a receptor sheet (which may be specifically 
designed for use in mass transfer or may be a 
conventional paper or film), the donor sheet is heated 
in an imagewise manner (usually from the backside) with 
localized heating effected by a thermal print head, 
irradiation through a mask or stencil, or coherent 
light imaged as with a laser or, light emitting diode, 
or solid state laser. The imagewise distribution of 
heat causes an imagewise transfer of material from a 
surface of the donor to the receptor which is in 
contact with that surface. The material which is 
transferred is usually a binder containing colorant 
(e.g., a dye, pigment, or both dye and pigment). The 
binder is a thermally softenable material which 
releases from a carrier layer on a carrier layer on the 
donor element and adheres and transfers to a receptor 
sheet. Thermal mass transfer imaging, like most other 
forms of imaging, has traditionally used the primary 
additive and subtractive colors (and black) as the  
 
colorant in the donor transfer layers. In commercial 
situations it has become desirable to be able to 
provide additional colors beyond red, yellow, green, 
blue, cyan, and magenta (and black). Tailored colors, 
fluorescent colors, and metallic images are desirably 
available to the image maker. Metal image forming impact printing elements have 
been disembeded with a vapor deposited metal film with 
a binder as a separate layer. U.S. Patent No. 
4,472,479 (Hayes et al.) describes an impact printing 
donor element which can provide a metallic appearing 
image which comprises a carrier layer and an impact 
transferable layer(s) containing metal particles or 
particles with metallic colors (e.g., mica flakes with 
coatings thereon). All working examples are of nonmetal 
flakes with coatings thereon. A dye may also be 
present in the transferable layer(s) to improve the 
tone of the metal color. A paper entitled "New Color Thermal Transfer 
Printing Media" presented to "The 5th International 
Congress on Advances in Non-Impact Printing 
Technologies" in San Diego, CA, November 12-17, 1989, 
described a thermal
