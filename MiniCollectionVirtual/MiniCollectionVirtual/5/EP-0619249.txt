(90) adapted to support objects in bulk form, a suction device (80) 
adapted to engage and grip any object contacted, means for controlling 

said suction device so that any object engaged may be released when appropriate, 
and means (49,102,103) for manipulating said suction device

and elevated to an elevated position, and so that it may be displaced 

in a direction along said supporting surface to various positions,
 

   said positions including a release position, from which an object 
engaged by said suction device may be released by appropriate control of

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a method and an apparatus for the 
individualization and controlled discharge of discrete objects available 
only in bulk form. The invention further concerns a method for determining 
physical data of discrete objects and a method for the classification 
of discrete objects according to the physical data determined, and 
the invention concerns the use of the apparatus to individualize comestible 
objects, such as pieces of fish, fillets of fish or fillets of 
frozen fish. Numerous products comprising individual elementary objects are recovered 
in bulk form and are required to be processed in an individualized 
form requiring a method of individualizing the elementary objects. 
The individualization may be necessary in order to determine physical 
data that must be determined for the individual objects of the products, 
e.g. unit weight, unit size or area, species, etc., e.g. when classification 
of the objects according to the physical data is required, or the 
individualization may be necessary in order to perform processing operations 
which inherently can only be performed on the individual objects. While weighing, inspecting and processing individual objects are 
reasonably simple tasks which may be standardized and automated in processing 
lines operating at high throughput rates, the initial stage of 
individualizing the objects may still be more difficult to automate. In 
order to obtain efficient operation of downstream processing equipment, 
it is generally required that the objects are presented at exact time 
intervals and at a high rate. Various types of equipment have been developed 
with the purpose of automating the individualization of various 
kinds of objects. These types of equipment may, however, have the drawback 
that the handling is too rough and may damage vulnerable objects, 
or the equipment may have limitations regarding the variety permissible 
among the objects in the bulk. In the case of processing fresh fish, apparatuses have been developed 
for individualization and sorting of fish presented in bulk form, 
which apparatuses comprise slits between rods or rolls, where the fish 
may pass between slits of different widths according to their thickness. 
An apparatus of this type may classify the incoming fish according to  
 
its thickness, whereby any later individualization method is somewhat 
simplified. In case of flat fish, e.g. the species plaice (pleuronectes platessa), 
brail or flounder (platichthys flesus), apparatuses based on 
sorti

A method for the individualization and controlled discharge of 
discrete objects presented in bulk form, comprising 

   placing a bulk of objects on a supporting surface, 
   lowering a suction device to a position proximal to said supporting 

surface to contact any object present at this position, 
   engaging and gripping by said suction device any object encountered, 

   elevating said suction device again in case no object is engaged, 
displacing the suction device in a direction along said supporting surface 

and lowering it again to a new position proximal to said supporting 
surface in order to contact any object present at that position, and repeating 

this sequence, in case no object is engaged, 
   elevating said suction device upon the engagement of an object, 

whereby one individualized object is picked out of said bulk, lifting it 
and keeping it suspended,
