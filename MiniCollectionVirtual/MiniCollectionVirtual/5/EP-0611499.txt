<ABSTRACT>
In a telecommunication system, a method and system for power regulation compares the received power to a target value at a receiving station to adjust the power of the transmitting station periodically or non-periodically. Calculation of the signal strength required at the transmitting station may be performed at either the transmitting or receiving station using the path loss between the respective stations. The target value may be a constant or a function of the distance from the base station or a function of the path loss between the transmitting and receiving station.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of power regulation techniques
in mobile radio telephone communications, and more particularly to periodic
and non-periodic power regulation of signal strengths received at a receiving
station.To minimize interference between different transmitters in a mobile
radio telephone system, the transmission power of the mobile station, and in
some systems the transmission power of the base station, is regulated at
intervals. In power regulation, the goal is to ensure that only the power
absolutely necessary to maintain satisfactory transmission of a call between a
mobile station and a base station is used. By regulating the power of mobile
transmissions to low levels with sufficient transmission quality, the likelihood
of interference between mobile transmissions is reduced.Another reason to maintain the power of mobile transmissions at the
lowest possible level is to reduce the energy consumed at the mobile station.
Accordingly, the batteries used to power portable mobile stations will require a
smaller capacity. A corresponding reduction in the size of the battery needed
results whereby the portable mobile stations can be made smaller.In existing analog cellular systems, the sending power of a mobile is
regulated by an order from the base station only when absolutely necessary.
The ongoing conversation is disturbed when a power regulation order is sent
resulting in traffic channel muting. Therefore, power regulation only occurs
when the level of the signal received in the base station is outside a range
defined by an upper and a lower threshold.In such prior art systems, for example as shown in U.S. Patent No.
4,485,486 to Webb et al, power regulation is achieved by measuring the
received signal strength of transmissions from a mobile station at the 
corresponding base station, comparing the signal strength with an upper and a lower
threshold indicative of a desired signal strength level range for proper reception, and
issuing a power adjustment order from the base to the mobile if indicated by the
comparison result. The monitoring is carried out at relatively infrequent intervals,
typically on the order of once every five seconds, and the regulation is carried out
only if indicated as being necessary.Although modem digital systems are adequate for power regulation, system
performance can be improved further. While the amount of interference is reduced
over regulated analog systems, interference still presents a problem.European Patent Application No. 462 952

measured received power level, wherein said new transmission power is equal to the sum

of the predetermined receiving power level and the path loss;
ordering said transmitting station to transmit at said new transmission power level,
wherein said new transmission power level is higher, lower, or equal to said known

transmission power level.
