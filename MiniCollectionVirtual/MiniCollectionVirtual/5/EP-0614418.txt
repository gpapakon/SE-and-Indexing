<ABSTRACT>
Granite-like plastics useful in all forms of molding and thermoforming are disclosed. The granite-like plastics include a multiplicity of particulates formed of a thermoplastic and/or thermoset plastic combination which are suspended within a clear or translucent matrix of the same thermoplastic material as the particulates. The particulates are maintained in suspension due to their isopycnic density with the matrix. Of particular importance are granite-like acrylics that can be used in place of standard acrylics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject invention relates generally to a method
of forming a synthetic material which simulates natural
substances such as stone and the like, and more particularly,
to a method of preparing and manufacturing a
synthetic plastic material capable of being formed into
utile shapes. Of great importance are embodiments of
the subject invention utilizing acrylics that may be
formed to complement coatings such as GRANICOAT™
manufactured by Safas Corporation.There currently exists a great need for synthetic
materials which mimic the appearance of natural stone,
and in particular granite. Such materials are commonly
used in the manufacture of flooring, tiles, counter tops,
sinks, architectural accoutrements, ornamental objects,
and for other purposes for which natural materials are
used.Today's acrylics are commonly available in dear or
solid colors, although several marbleized varieties are
now on the market. Although the subject invention is primarily
directed to acrylic compositions, it may be utilized
in any application where a thermoplastic material is
required. Such applications include, but are not limited
to thermoforming, injection molding, blow molding.
extrusion, etc.The subject acrylics may be used in any application
served by conventional acrylics. Such applications
include, but not limited to, situations requiring low electrical
conductivity, good arc resistance and dielectric
strength, and the ability to resist alkali, non-oxidizing
acids, aliphatic hydrocarbons, saltwater, photographic
and battery solutions, and a wide variety of commercial
products and food stuffs. In particular, these acrylics go
hand-in-hand with coatings such as GRANICOAT™ to
span the spectrum of applications for granite-like plastics.The prior art is replete with attempts at producing a
synthetic material which is natural is appearance. One
such product is that described by Ross, et al., U.S. Patent
No. 4.433.070, issued February 21, 1984 (reexamination
certificate issued February 10, 1987). Ross, et al.
teach cultured onyx, cultured marble and like mineral-mimicking
products. These products are formed from a
discontinuous phase comprising a synthetic organic
resin portion hardened to a predetermined hardness
and a visually distinguishable continuous phase comprising
a synthetic organic resin portion separately
hardened to a predetermined hardness. The discontinuous
phase is intimately distributed to form a marble-like
appearance. Since the appearance of onyx and marble
is swirled as opposed to suspended, as with
