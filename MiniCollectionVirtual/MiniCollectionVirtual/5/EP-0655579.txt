<ABSTRACT>
Burner appliance with closed housing (2) in which 
one or more inlets (4) for combustion air are disposed. 

Within the housing (2) there are a burner unit (8) and the 
inlet of a flue gas discharge duct (26) in which a heat 

exchanger (24) is fitted. A fan (22) provides a forced flow 
of air and flue gases in the burner appliance. Provision is 

made within the housing (2) for an air flow path from at 
least one air inlet (4) to the inlet of the flue gas 

discharge duct (26) outside the combustion zone (30) of the 
burner unit (8). The space between the combustion zone (30) 

and the opposite inner wall of the housing (2) next to the 
combustion surface (20) can be essentially free from 

obstacles, or the combustion zone (30) can be surrounded at 
least partially by one or more walls which extend up to a 

predetermined distance from the inlet of the flue gas 
discharge duct (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a burner appliance 
comprising: an essentially closed housing having one or 
more air inlets for admitting air into the housing; a 
burner unit, disposed within the housing, for mixing the 
air with a combustible gas supplied under pressure and 
burning the premixed gas/air mixture from a combustion 
surface in a combustion zone within and at least locally at 
a distance from the housing; a flue gas discharge duct 
having an inlet fitted within the housing; a heat exchanger 
for the transfer of heat of flue gases to a medium present 
in the heat exchanger; a fan for forced flow of air and 
flue gases in the burner appliance; and an air flow path 
within the housing from at least one air inlet to the inlet 
of the flue gas discharge duct outside the combustion zone 
of the burner unit. Such a burner appliance is known from 
GB-A-2 255 169, in which a combustion chamber is formed by 
walls comprising cooling channels and extending from the 
combustion surface to a heat exchanger. Flue gases from the 
combustion zone in the combustion chamber pass through the 
heat exchanger and into the housing, where the flue gases 
are removed through the flue gas discharge duct of which 
the inlet is situated above the heat exchanger. An air flow 
path stretches from the air inlet of the housing to the 
inlet of the flue gas discharge duct outside the combustion 
zone of the combustion chamber, also bypassing the heat 
exchanger. A configuration of this type, in which the air 
is offered a bypass route through the burner appliance, 
leads to mixing of the combustible gas and the air in the 
mixer of the burner unit which is now primarily determined 
by the configuration of the mixer, since the pressure 
difference, in operation, between that zone of the burner 
unit in which mixing of gas and air takes place and the 
combustion zone of the burner unit can be made very small. 
This means that the combustion is also virtually 
independent of variations in the fan flow rate as a result 
of temperature changes of the air drawn in (in the case of  
 
a fan fitted in the air inlet) or temperature changes of 
the flue gases (in the case of a fan fitted in the flue gas 
discharge duct), fan tolerances and the chosen length of 
the flue gas discharge duct (in the case of a fan fitted in 
the flue gas discharge duct). Protection and monitoring of 
the burner appliance can therefore be carried out simply 
and inexpensively. A drawback of the known burner appliance is the 
high cost of constructing the
