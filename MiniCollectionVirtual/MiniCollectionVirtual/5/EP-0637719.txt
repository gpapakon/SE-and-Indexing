<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is an exterior wall connection for a combustion-air and exhaust-gas conduit of an appliance working with a burner system, such as, in particular, of a heating appliance, refrigerator or the like installed in a mobile room, the exterior wall connection being mountable in a perforation of a wall (3) of the room and having an exhaust-gas chamber (2) which is contiguous with the exhaust-gas conduit and out of which the exhaust gas passes into the open by way of an exit orifice (9) as well as a combustion-air chamber (1) which is contiguous with the combustion-air conduit and which combustion air enters by way of an entry orifice (8), the entry orifice (8) being located in a radially outwardly open annular space (7) which, with the exterior wall connection mounted, is formed between the wall (3) and a disc-like cover (6) located at a distance from the wall and which surrounds the exhaust-gas chamber (2), and the exit orifice (9) being formed directed downwards in a part of the exhaust-gas chamber (2) located on the outside of the cover (6).

<CLAIMS>
External wall connection box for a combustion air and
exhaust gas duct of an appliance operating with a

burner system, such as in particular a heater,
refrigerator or similar installed in a mobile room,

whereby the external wall connection box may be
attached in a cavity of a wall (3) of the room and has

an exhaust gas chamber (2) adjoining the exhaust gas
duct, from which chamber the exhaust gas passes into

the open air via an outlet opening (9), as well as a
combustion air chamber (1) adjoining the combustion air

duct, into which chamber combustion air enters via an
inlet opening (8), whereby the inlet opening (8) is

located in an annular space (7) open radially outwards,
which when the external wall connection box is attached

is constructed between the wall (3) and a disc-like
cover (6) located at a distance from the wall, said

annular space surrounding the exhaust gas chamber (2),
and the outlet opening (9) is provided in a part of the

exhaust gas chamber (2) lying on the outside of the
cover (6), characterised in that a lip (13) deflecting

the flow of exhaust gas away from the cover (6) is
provided on the cover (6) at a distance from and below

the downward directed outlet opening (9), whereby said
outlet opening (9) is located in the cover (6).
External wall connection box according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the inlet opening (8) surrounds

the exhaust gas chamber (2) in a ring shape.
External wall connection box according to one of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the exhaust gas

chamber (2) is closed off on the outside by a conically
sunken face wall (10).
