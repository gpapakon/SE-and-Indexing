<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to semiconductor 
light-emitting devices and methods for making such devices. 
More particularly, the invention relates to a short 
wavelength semiconductor laser which emits light beams of 
red to orange colors and a light emitting diode (LED) 
having a wavelength band of red to green colors, and 
methods for making the same. Recently, red semiconductor lasers having a 
wavelength band of 630 to 680 nm constructed of AlGaInP 
have been receiving attention as a promising source of 
light for POS, as well as for high definition, high density 
photomagnetic disks. Indeed, researches and developments 
have been made in this connection. When such laser is used 
for disks, fundamental mode stability and good optical 
characteristics such as astigmatism and so on, in 
particular are important. For this reason, there exists a  
 
need for a semiconductor laser of the refractive index 
guide type which confines light beams within the region of 
oscillation. Refractive index guide type semiconductor laser 
devices of 680 nm wavelength band have hitherto been known 
including one shown in Fig. 11 which is of the effective 
refractive index guide type, and another shown in Fig. 12 
which is of the real refractive index guide type. Fig. 11 
is a sectional view showing the semiconductor laser device 
of the effective refractive index guide type, and Fig. 12 
is a sectional view showing the semiconductor laser device 
of the real refractive index guide type. The semiconductor 
laser device shown in Fig. 11 is fabricated in such a way 
that on an n-GaAs substrate 131 having (100) face as a main 
face are grown an n-(Al0.5Ga0.5)0.5In0.5P cladding layer (1.5 
µm thick) 133, a non-doped Ga0.5In0.5P active layer (0.05 µm 
thick) 134, a p-(Al0.5Ga0.5)0.5In0.5P cladding layer (1.5 µm 
thick) 135, and a p-Ga0.5In0.5P intermediate layer 136 
according to a MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor 
Deposition) process. Then, the intermediate layer 136 and 
an upper portion of the cladding layer 135 are removed by 
etching, leaving a centrally located ridge portion 141. 
Subsequently, n-GaAs current constrictive layers 132 are 
grown on both sides of the ridge portion 141 and, in 
addition, a p-GaAs contact layer 137 (2 µm thick) is grown  
 
over the entire region. Finally, electrodes 139, 140 are 
formed respectively on the underside of the substrate 131 
and on the surface of the contact layer 137. In such a 
semiconductor laser, the current constrictive layers 132 
limit current passage to decrease
