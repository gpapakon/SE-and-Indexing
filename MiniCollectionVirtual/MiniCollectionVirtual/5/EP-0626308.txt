<ABSTRACT>
A device for reducing spray flung upwards from the wheels 
(10) of a vehicle. The device comprises a splash guard 

(12), such as a mudguard and/or a splash flap, and a ribbed 
plate (16) for guiding the spray, disposed inside the 

splash guard (12). The ribbed plate (16) is formed from 
sheetlike material by corrugating it in the way that ridges 

(18) and recesses (24) are formed in the plate (16). In the 
ridges (18) facing the splash guard have been made openings 

(26) for guiding the spray through the ribbed plate (16) 
towards the splash guard (12). The ridges have preferably 

been formed in the way that the spray hitting the ribbed 
plate meets an inclined surface on the plate formed by the 

ridges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for reducing 
spray flung upwards from the wheels of a vehicle, which 
device comprises a splash guard, such as a mudguard and/or 
a splash flap, and means guiding the spray, disposed on the 
wheel-facing surface of the splash guard at least behind 
the wheel in relation to the direction of the movement of 
the vehicle. The invention relates thus to a spray-suppressing device 
intended for use in commercial vehicles for reducing 
problems caused to other motorists by water and other spray 
and thus for improving the safety on the roads. In addition 
to ordinary splash guards, mudguards and mud flaps, a layer 
of some spray-suppressing material or some splash-guiding 
elements are being used even now. The object of the layers of spray-suppressing material is 
to attenuate the kinetic energy of the water and mist 
emitted from the tyres of the vehicle and to retain the 
water in order to reduce the turbulent spray. The water-guiding 
elements are designed to direct the water hitting 
the mudguards and mud flaps downwards in a controlled way. The German patent application DE 39 39 937 (FIG. 9 - 11) 
discloses a mudguard which is fitted with a wall for 
guiding the water spray. The wall is composed of separate 
parallel lamellas, which are attached from their ends to 
the bent edges of the mudguard. The splash water runs out 
through a space between the wall and the mudguard. The 
lamellas are disposed in the way that the channels formed 
between them are essentially parallel with the movement of 
the water emitted from the wheel. The object of the device 
is to lead the major proportion of the spray water directly 
through the channels between the lamellas into the space  
 
between the wall of lamellas and the mudguard without the 
water touching the lamellas. This construction of lamellas 
is difficult and inconvenient to realize, because each 
lamella has to be attached to the mudguard separately. Also 
the spray-suppressive effect will remain relatively modest, 
as the kinetic energy of the passing water will not be 
attenuated and the water is not automatically directed 
forwards but can, because of the angle of the lamella, run 
back towards the wheel in the channel. Another arrangement for retaining and guiding the spray 
water is disclosed in the British patent application GB 21 
43 189. On the inside of the mudguard is arranged a 
flexible, water-retaining plate or surface, on the wheel-facing 
surface of which protrusions, lamellas or narrow 
folds have

<CLAIMS>
A device for reducing spray flung upwards from the 
wheels (10) of a vehicle , which device comprises a splash 

guard (12), such as a mudguard and/or a splash flap, and 
means for guiding the spray, disposed on the wheel-facing 

surface of the splash guard (12) at least behind the wheel 
(10) in relation to the direction of the movement of the 

vehicle characterized in that 

the spray-guiding means comprises a ribbed plate (16) 
formed from sheetlike material by corrugating it in the way 

that ridges (18) and recesses (24) are formed in the plate 
(16) and that 
in the ridges (18) facing the splash guard have been made

ridges are formed in the ribbed plate in the way that the 

spray hitting the ribbed plate will there meet an inclined 
surface formed by the ridges (18). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
ribbed plate (16) is disposed in the splash guard (12) 

substantially parallel thereto.
