<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for forming an electret nonwoven filter and products of such a process.Nonwoven webs of electret fibers are typically formed of loosely associated fibers. The fibers can be electrostatically
charged prior to, during, or after, being formed into a nonwoven web. For example, post-formation charging is described
in U.S. Patent No.4,588,537 which charges a lofty nonwoven web formed by a variety of methods including carding and
melt blowing. The webs are charged while under compression and then permitted to return to their original loft. This
patent states that precharged fibers are preferably bipolar so that they tend to resist crimping which is avoided by pre-crimping
when using the charging method of this patent.Fibers can also be charged while they are being formed, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,215,682, where melt-blown
fibers are bombarded by ions or electrons immediately after being extruded from the melt-blowing orifices. The
fibers solidify extremely rapidly in the atmosphere and are collected as a semi-coherent mass of entangled microfibers.
The webs are described as preferably open to provide a low pressure drop for liquid passing through the filter.A particularly effective method of forming a nonwoven electret fiber filter is described in U.S. Reissue Patent No.
30,782. The electret fibers in this patent are formed from a corona charged film that is fibrillated to form the charged
fibers. The charged fibers can then be formed into a nonwoven web by common methods such as carding or air laying.
This charging method provides a particularly high density of injected charges. However, problems are encountered with
forming webs from these precharged fibers. The fibers are generally quite large and uncrimped. They also have a resistance
to bending. Due in part to these properties, the fibers resist formation into a uniform coherent web, particularly at
low basis weights. This problem is partially addressed in U.S. Patent No. 4,363,682, which proposes the use of such
filibrated fiber webs in face mask applications. In order to provide a more coherent web, as well as one that resists
shedding fibers, this patent proposes a post-embossing treatment. This post-embossing welds the outer surface fibers
together allegedly providing a more coherent and comfortable web for use as a face mask. However, this treatment will
also tend to result in a more condensed web, which would increase pressure loss over the filter.It is an object of the present invention to provide

charged fibers have substantially rectangular cross-sections.
The method of any of claims 1 to 2 wherein the
reinforcement scrim (11) is an inner layer between two

outer nonwoven filter web layers (10, 10').
The method of any of claims 1 to 3 further comprising
randomizing the carded filter web layer (10 or 10')

prior to joining with the scrim reinforcement (11).
