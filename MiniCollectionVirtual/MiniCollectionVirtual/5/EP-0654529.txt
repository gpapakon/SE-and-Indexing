<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to α-2,8-sialyltransferase, a cDNA coding for the α-2,8-sialyltransferase, a recombinant vector containing the cDNA as an insert and a cell harboring the recombinant vector as well as methods of producing same. The invention further relates to a method of producing carbohydrate chains using the α-2,8-sialyltransferase and to a method of producing carbohydrate chains through production of the α-2,8-sialyltransferase in transformant cells. Still further, it relates to a method of detecting the α-2,8-sialyltransferase and a method of inhibiting the production of the α-2,8-sialyltransferase, each using DNA coding for the α-2,8-sialyltransferase of the invention. The α-2,8-sialyltransferase of the invention is useful, in particular, in the production of carbohydrate chains having a useful physiological activity, for example the ganglioside GD3, and modifications thereof.While proteins produced in prokaryotes, for example Escherichiacoli, have no carbohydrate chain, proteins and lipids produced in eukaryotes such as yeast, fungi, plant ceils and animal cells have a carbohydrate chain bound thereto in many instances.Carbohydrate chains bound to proteins in animal cells include N-glycoside bond type carbohydrate chains (also called N-glycans) bound to an asparagine (Asn) residue in the protein and O-glycoside bond type carbohydrate chains (also called O-glycans) bound to a serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residue. It has recently been revealed that a certain kind of lipid containing a carbohydrate chain is covalently bound to a number of proteins and that those proteins are attached to the cell membrane through the lipid. This carbohydrate chain-containing lipid is called glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor.Other carbohydrate chains, including glycosaminoglycans, are also present in animal cells. Compounds comprising a protein covalently bound to a glycosaminoglycan are called proteoglycans. The glycosaminoglycans of the carbohydrate chains of proteoglycans are similar in structure to O-glycans, which are carbohydrate chains of glycoproteins, but differ chemically therefrom. Glycosaminoglycans comprise repeating disaccharide units composed of glucosamine or galactosamine and a uronic acid (except for keratan sulfate which has no uronic acid residue) and have a covalently bound sulfate residue (except for hyaluronic acid which has no sulfate residue).Further, carbohydrate chains in animal cells are also present in substances called glycolipids. Sphingoglycolipids are one type of
