<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for improving the performance degradation of a 
cable equalizer in a serial digital transmission system wherein the 

performance degradation results from parasitic coupling between the 
input and output of the cable equalizer. The circuit comprises a 

potentiometer which is coupled to the output of the cable equalizer. 
The wiper of the potentiometer is coupled to the input of the cable 

equalizer through a capacitor and a resistor. The capacitor produces a 
correction signal on the input which is proportional to the derivative 

of the output signal of the equalizer. The resistor coupled to the 
capacitor injects the correction signal into the input signal to reduce 

the effect of the parasitic coupling between the input and output of the 
cable equalizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a circuit for use with a 
cable equalizer in a data transmission system. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a circuit for correcting performance 
degradation which arises from physical layout effects in a high-bit 
serial digital cable equalizer. High speed serial data transmission systems typically 
include a cable equalizer for regeneration of the signal at the receiver 
end. In a typical transmission system, the cable equalizer will be 
required to regenerate high frequency signals (e.g. 135 MegaHertz) 
which have been attenuated by as much as 30 decibels (dB). In a typical system, the cable equalizer comprises a circuit 
which is a monolithic integrated circuit. As will be appreciated, an 
advantage of a monolithic integrated circuit implementation is the 
compact size of the package and savings in printed circuit board area. 
However, the close proximity of the signal input stage and the signal 
output stage on the integrated equalizer circuit can create conditions 
for unwanted feedback mechanisms. These feedback mechanisms can 
ultimately degrade the input signal to noise level and hence the 
overall performance of the data transmission system. A principal cause of this unwanted feedback is parasitic 
inductance and capacitance in the external packaging of the integrated 
circuit and the interconnect on the printed circuit board which 
surrounds the integrated equalizer circuit. Typically the currents and 
voltages in the output stage of the equalizer circuit are coupled back to  
 
the input by the presence of the unwanted inductance (Ldi/dt) and 
capacitance (Cdv/dt) respectively. Consequently, this parasitic coupling 
produces an interference signal which frequently takes the form of a 
small and differentiated version of the output signal from the 
equalizer circuit. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the 
appearance of the interference signal can result in performance 
degradation in the operation of the cable equalizer and the data 
transmission system. In a first aspect, of the present invention provides a 
circuit comprising a potentiometer, a capacitor and a resistor. The 
circuit is coupled between the input port and output port of a 
monolithic integrated cable equalizer. The function of the network is to intentionally create a 
signal which is the complement of the resultant of all interfering 
signals which are summed at the input of the equalizer. By injecting 
such a signal at the input port of the equalizer,
