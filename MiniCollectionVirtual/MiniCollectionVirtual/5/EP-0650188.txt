<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a high fin density heatsink 
(1,3) from a plurality of fins (3) each having a bottom 

portion of generally bell-bottom shape and a base unit (1) 
of predetermined thickness having a plurality of grooves 

(5) therein. The method comprises the steps of placing 
the plurality of fins (3) loosely in respective ones of the 

grooves (5), and applying downward and horizontal pressure 
to the base unit intermediate respective ones of the fins 

for swaging the base unit so as to urge the fins (3) 
downwardly into the respective ones of the grooves (5) 

thereby creating a solid connection between the base unit 
(1) and the fins (3) with excellent thermal contact 

therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the fabrication
of heatsinks, and more particularly to a method and
apparatus for fabricating a high fin density heatsink from
separately extruded fins and a base unit.It is known in the art to utilize heatsinks for
dissipating heat generated by electronic circuits in modern
devices. Such well known heatsinks typically comprise a
base unit to which the heat generating electronic devices
are mounted, and a plurality of fins projecting from the
base unit for dissipating the generated heat. It is an
object of these heatsinks to maximise the surface area of
the fins in order to provide optimum heat transfer from the
heatsink to the surrounding atmosphere. It is a further
object of well known heatsinks to provide a good thermal
contact between the base unit and the fins.In order to achieve the latter mentioned object,
according to known prior art methods, heatsinks have been
fabricated by metal extrusion through a die which is cut to
the required shape specifications such that the base unit
and fins are of integral construction. However, as
discussed above, efficiency of operation of such heatsinks
is regulated by the surface area and amount of metal used
versus the length of each fin. The current design limit 
for prior art extrusion processes in terms of fin thickness
to height, is 3:1 or less. Thus, in the event that an
extruded fin is excessively thin or excessively high, the
pressure of the extruded metal has a tendency to destroy
the die.In an effort to overcome the problems of integral
extruded heatsinks, and in an effort to provide increased
fin density and overall height, certain prior art
fabrication methods have used separate extrusion of the
base unit and the fins, and subsequent assembly to form the
heatsink. For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,261,396 (Trunk)
teaches a method of securing corrugated metal fins to a
base unit by means of epoxy cement. Unfortunately, the
epoxy gluing method disclosed in the Trunk patent results
in poor thermal conductivity between the base unit and
respective fins.U.S. Patent No. 3,216,496 (Katz) teaches separate
fabrication of a bus bar or base unit having, on its flat
side, a plurality of slots for receiving separately
fabricated fins. The slots extend transversely the length
of the bar and are arranged so as to hold the fins in
substantially parallel relationship. The fins themselves
are strip-shaped and preferably of width equal to that of
the bus bar. The fins are joined to the bus bar by means
of inserting the fins into the

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for swaging a base unit of predetermined
thickness and having a plurality of grooves therein for

receiving respective bell-bottom shaped fins to form a high
fin density heatsink, said apparatus comprising:


a) a planar work surface;
b) an axle mounted parallel to said planar work
surface;
c) a plurality of disks mounted for rotation about
said axle and spaced apart a sufficient distance to allow

respective ones of said fins to pass therebetween;
d) means for adjusting the height of said axle to
provide a clearance between the circumference of said disks

and said planar work surface which is less than said
predetermined thickness of said base unit, such that upon

advancing said base unit though said clearance respective
ones of said disks apply downward and horizontal pressure

to said base unit intermediate respective ones of said fins

downwardly into respective ones of said grooves thereby
creating a secure connection between said base unit and

said fins with good thermal contact therebetween.

distance between successive ones of said disks is

equivalent to the distance between successive ones of said 
plurality of grooves.
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein each of said disks
has a width approximately equal to and no greater than said

distance between successive ones of said plurality of
grooves minus the width of each said fins.
The apparatus of claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein each of said
plurality of disks further comprises a raised circular hub

portion of predetermined thickness against which an
adjacent one of said plurality of disks rests, said

predetermined thickness defining said sufficient distance
of spacing between respective ones of said disks.
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein said raised circular
hub has a keyway in the form of a rectangular slot therein

for receiving a cooperatively shaped key projecting from
said axle for mounting said plurality of disks thereto.
The apparatus of any preceding claim, wherein said
means for adjusting the height of said axle further

comprises a pair of threaded mounting blocks for receiving
said axle, gear means connected to each of said threaded

mounting blocks, and a handle connected to said gear means
such that upon turning said handle said gear means causes

each of said threaded mounting blocks to move vertically
