<ABSTRACT>
A four directional self-aligning wedge clamp is provided for 
securing electronic modules (4) in a rack (22). In use, the clamp 

assembly is slid into a channel (14) of the rack and expanded to 
engage the walls of the channel. The clamp assembly comprises a 

number of wedge elements (30,42,44,66,67,78,88) with a central rod 
(86) passing therethrough. On tightening of the rod (86), wedge 

elements (66,67) are urged outwards of the clamp assembly against side walls of the channel (14) and further wedge elements (42,44) 
are urged against the module (4) to provide a substantially rigid 

assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for clamping a 
device to a rack having a longitudinal groove therein, 
comprising: 
a rod having a retainer on one end and threads on the 
other end; a multiplicity of adjacently positioned sections 
having holes larger in diameter than said rod and receiving said 
rod therethrough, said sections having complementary sloped faces 
therebetween;  and means for engaging the threads on said rod.   Numerous electronic control devices are typically 
carried aboard airplanes, large ships and in some military 
vehicles. The usual mounting for such devices is by rack 
mounting, wherein the individual electronic units are mounted 
side by side or in a vertical arrangement in an enclosure having 
means to provide mechanical moorings for the units. Older 
methods for installing such devices in the rack included the use 
of flanges mounted on the front face of the individual electronic 
units which could be bolted to flanges on the rack. Later 
devices provided clamping apparatus on the rack which captured a 
flange formed on the front of the individual units to retain the 
units to the rack. With the establishment of standardized electronic 
module size specifications has come the need for channel engaging 
clamps for mechanical retention of the unit or module to the 
rack. In this type of arrangement, the rack is provided with 
channels extending into its enclosure on both the top and bottom. In one known apparatus of the kind defined 
hereinbefore at the beginning and described in a Series 260 
"card-Lok" retainer product sheet published by Calmark 
Corporation, 4915 Walnut Grove Avenue, San Gabriel, California 
91776, United States of America, wedge clamps having a series of 
wedge shaped elements and having a single screw passing 
therethrough have been utilized to mount printed circuit boards 
in a rack having a single channel. This form of existing wedge 
clamp, when relaxed, features a generally aligned series of 
wedges, each centrally mounted on a single screw and interacting 
with a wedge shaped element mounted to the printed circuit board 
to be mounted. The relaxed wedge clamp may be inserted into the  
 
channel of the rack when in 
place, the screw is tightened, 
causing a shortening of the 
effective length of the clamp and a consequent transverse displacement of the 
wedges from their relaxed aligned position. This displacement 
causes a widening of the effective width of the clamp, thereby 
creating rigidity with the rack's channels. This type of simple 
wedge

Apparatus for clamping a device (4) to a rack (12) having a 
longitudinal groove (14) therein, comprising: 


a rib (30) on the device (4) having a longitudinal channel 
(32) therethrough and whose first and second end faces (38,40) 

are oppositely sloped to form acute angles relative to the device 
(4); 
a rod (86) having a retainer on one end and threads (92) on 
the other end; 
a multiplicity of adjacently positioned sections (42, 
44,66,67,78) having holes larger in diameter than said rod (86) 

and receiving said rod (86) therethrough, said sections having 
complementary sloped faces therebetween, the sections including 

two intermediate sections (42,44) having faces (56) sloped to 
complementarily engage the first and second end faces (38,40) of 

said rib (30), and two wedge sections (66,67) having faces (82) sloped 
to complementarily engage further faces (58,68) provided on the 

two intermediate sections (42,44); 
and means (88) for engaging the threads (92) on said rod 
(86); 
the rod (86) being positioned in the longitudinal channel 
(32) of the rib (30) and extending through the adjacently 

positioned sections (42,44,66,67,78); and the arrangement of the 
sloped faces being such that, by clamping of the adjacently 

positioned sections (42,44,66,67,78) to the rib (30) between the 
said retainer and the engaging means (88) on engagement of the 

said threads (92) with the engaging means (88), the intermediate 
sections (42,44) are forced by the end faces (38,40) of the rib 

(30) against the device (4), and each wedge section (66,67) and 
the adjacent intermediate section (42,44) are caused to react 

against each other transversely in the groove (14) to engage its 
side walls (24). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that said 
two intermediate sections (42,44) are flexibly linked. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that said 
sloped faces of said two intermediate sections (42,44) engage the 

faces of said rib (30) in abutment.  
 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that said 
two intermediate sections (42,44) are frictionally held to said 

device (4) when said rod (86) is fully engaged with said engaging 
means (172).
