Composite structures comprising an expoxy resin cured or
polymerized by a one step moderate heating between 75°C and 120°C

of an epoxy resin composition wherein the curing system comprises a
combination of:


(i) at least an imidazole which, alone, can cause the
polymerization of the epoxy resin at a temperature above

about 75°C ;
(ii) at least a polyamine compound which, alone, leads to the
polymerization of the epoxy resin at a temperature lower

than about 75°C,

the amount of the curing system being 5 % to 50 % based on the weight
of the whole composition, the workshop use time of the formulated

composition being higher than 21 days at room temperature and the
water uptake of the composition measured to the standard ISO 75 14

days at 70°C being at most 2 %.
Composite structures according to claim 1, 
characterized in that

the epoxy base represents from about 50 % to 95 % by weight of the
resin composition, preferably between about 65 % and 90 % by weight of

the composition.
Composite structures according to one of claims 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the epoxy base consists of a single resin or a
mixture of mutually compatible epoxy resins.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the epoxy base contains an additive to improve the
flexibility and/or the adhesion capacity, these additives being in particular

selected from the thermoplastic aromatic polymers, of the polysulfone or
polyether-sulfone type, or non-aromatic polymers, such as the vinyl 

acetate copolymers, and/or the elastomers, of the butadiene copolymer-kind,
and/or other additives known to be compatible with epoxy resins.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 4,

characterized in that
 the epoxy resin is selected from the diglycidyl ether
of bisphenol A resins (DGEBA) and/or the novolacs (polyglycidyl ether of

phenol-formaldehyde novolac).
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 constituent (i) of the curing system belongs to the
family of the imidazoles or their substituted derivatives.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the second constituent (ii) of the curing system is
selected from the aromatic, cycloaliphatic or modified amines.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 7,

characterized in that
 the quantity of curing system represents from about
10 % by weight to 35 % by weight of the resin composition.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 8,

characterized in that
, for 100 parts by weight of the curing system,
constituent (i) represents from about 3 to 70 parts, the balance to 100

being given by constituent (ii).
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 9,
obtained by low pressure molding particularly at 0.4 to 0.9 bar absolute.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
as laminated structures the uptake of humidity of which does not exceed

1 % by weight, the measurement being made after ageing in water at
70°C for 14 days according to the standard ISO 75.
Laminated composite structures according to any one of
claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that
 they comprise fibrous
reinforcements, of the kind of the textile reinforcements used in

composite materials, that is woven and/or nonwoven textile 
reinforcements, comprising conventional and/or synthetic and/or

technical textile materials, such as glass, polyester, polyamide, aramid,
carbon, silicon and others.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 9
obtained by impregnation or glueing with the epoxy resin composition

defined in said claims of conventional reinforcements for making
composite materials, said reinforcements being selected particularly from

forms such as polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride foams as well as
honeycomb structures, particularly polyolefines, aluminum or arachid

fibers.
Composite structures according to any one of claims 1 to 13,
usable in the field of shipbuilding.
