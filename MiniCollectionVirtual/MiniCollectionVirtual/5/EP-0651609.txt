<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally in the field of
veterinary vaccines, vaccine compositions, and methods of
producing same. More particularly, this invention
relates to vaccine compositions and methods for
protecting animals against diseases associated with
infection by toxigenic strains of Pasteurellamultocida.Pasteurellamultocida has been associated with
disease in many species of animals, including man and
bovine, ovine and porcine animals. It typically affects
the nasopharyngeal regions and lungs of infected animals.
For example, toxigenic strains of P. multocida, capsular
type A or D, cause atrophic rhinitis in swine. Atrophic
rhinitis (AR) results in severe necrosis of the epithelia
of the upper respiratory tract as well as deformities and
atrophy of the turbinates and snouts of pigs.The pathogenicity of P. multocida is due in
large part to the production of a potent necrotizing
toxin, also called dermonecrotic toxin (DNT), which will 
be referred to hereinafter as "the toxin". The toxin has
been characterized as a heat-labile protein with a
molecular weight of approximately 140,000 to 160,000.P. multocida is distinguishable from other
species of Pasteurella on the basis of its growth
characteristics, as follows: hemolysis: negative (90%);
growth on MacConkey's agar: negative; indole production:
positive; urease production: negative; and mannitol
metabolism: positive. See, Zinsser, Microbiology, edit.
by Joklik et al., Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York,
1980, pages 791-793.Currently available vaccines for protecting
animals from diseases associated with infection by P.
multocida include inactivated toxigenic P. multocida
cells, inactivated preparations of partly purified P.
multocida toxin and combinations of P. multocida cell-free
preparations with other inactivated P. multocida
strains or B. bronchiseptica strains. [See, e.g., M.
Kobisch et al, Vet. Record, 124:57-61 (1989); and N. T.
Foged et al, Vet. Record, 125:7-11 (1989)]. These
vaccine preparations, however, are not fully protective
against disease because they fail to elicit effective
amounts of the antibody that neutralizes the toxin, known
as "antitoxin". There remains a need in the art of veterinary
practice for effective vaccines against infection of
animals by toxigenic P. multocida.The present invention provides novel vaccine
compositions and components which protect animals against
disease associated with infection by toxigenic
Pasteurellamultocida. These vaccine compositions are
characterized by the ability to elicit significant
quantiti
