<ABSTRACT>
A method for determining the block size of a transform coder in 
which the digital audio signals having spectral and temporal structure 

are decomposed into plural spectral frames. The method involves 
defining the audio signal into time intervals according to the temporal 

masking properties of a human auditory system; obtaining a peak value 
in each of these time intervals; calculating differences among the peak 

values; and selecting a block size based on a comparison of the 
differences against a predefined value.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of determining the transform block length in a 
transform coder process which decomposes digital audio signals having spectral and 
temporal structures, into plural spectral frames. From WO 91/16769, an adaptive-block-length, adaptive-transform and adaptive-window 
transform coder, decoder and encoder/decoder or high-quality audio is known in which the 
trade off in transform coders between time resolution and frequency resolution is 
optimized by adaptively selecting the transform and/or by adaptively selecting the analysis 
window. It is known that a long block length may improve filter selectivity but will reduce 
temporal resolution, which may result in audible signal distortion occurring outside the 
ear's temporal psychoacoustic masking interval. In the known device, a transient detector 
adaptively selects signal sample block lengths shorter than the maximum block lengths 
normally used when shorter block lengths are needed to ensure psychoacoustic masking 
of distortion artifacts created by transient signals. The digitized signal samples are passed 
through a high-pass filter and grouped into subblocks. The peak amplitude within each 
subblock is compared with the peak amplitude of the previous subblock. If the change 
between peak amplitudes of adjacent subblocks does not exceed specific thresholds, the 
coder utilizes the maximum signal sample block length. If the change in amplitude 
between adjacent subblocks does exceed the specific thresholds, a shorter block length is 
selected. From WO 92/17884, a high efficiency digital data encoding and decoding apparatus is 
known in which digital data are arranged into blocks by plural samples and orthogonal 
transform is effected in each block to produce coefficient data, which are encoded with an 
adaptive number of bits. A plurality of orthogonal transform units transform the input 
digital data with different block lengths. Only one of the outputs is selected on the basis of 
outputs of the orthogonal transform units. The apparatus includes a block length decision 
unit for determining the block lengths for orthogonal transform of each band based on 
characteristics of block data prior to orthogonal transform of each band.  
 Compression algorithms for wide band audio signals are finding 
wide-spread applications in recent years. In the area of consumer 
electronics, the digital compact cassette (DCC) and the mini-disc 
system (MD) are two applications of these compression algorithms.
