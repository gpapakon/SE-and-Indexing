<ABSTRACT>
A coating of metal and its oxide can be used to 
provide susceptor properties. By reactively evaporating a 

metal such as aluminium in the presence of oxygen using a 
slight excess of aluminium, it is possible to produce, over 

a narrow range of stoichiometry, a material which shows 
microwave susceptor properties. 
A microwave susceptor barrier film may be made in 
this way, which comprises a plastics film having a coating 

thereon comprising an essentially uniform mixture of a metal 
and its oxide, the amount of metal being slightly in excess 

of stoichiometry, whereby the coated film has susceptor 
properties. Such a film may be used as a foodstuff package 

for microwaving, wherein the film is so located in the 
package as to brown or crisp the surface of the foodstuff 

therein during microwaving.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of a microwave interactive barrier
film as a microwave susceptor to provide heating and browning of a surface
adjacent the film. By susceptor we mean a material which, during microwaving,
becomes heated to a stable temperature (below its melting or other deterioration
point) so as to provide heating of a surface of a product adjacent the film.A microwave susceptor is a microwave responsive
heating device that is used in microwave cooking for
browning or crisping the surface of foodstuffs to improve
their appearance or texture. In normal microwave cooking
without a susceptor, the microwaves penetrate through the
hulk of the foodstuff and interact with it (primarily with
the water it contains), heating and cooking it by a process
akin to "steaming". Since temperatures do not normally
significantly exceed the boiling point of water (100°C), the
surface of the foodstuff has a relatively bland appearance
which is, for some foodstuffs, unacceptable to the consumer
who prefers the crisper or browner appearance and texture of
a conventionally cooked foodstuff. Use of a susceptor as an
adjunct to microwave cooking can overcome this problem,
because when the susceptor is exposed to microwave energy,
it heats up to a significantly higher temperature (typically
greater than 150°C) and this heat is then transferred from
the susceptor to the surface of the foodstuff by a
combination of radiation, convection and conduction,
browning or crisping it. To be efficient, the susceptor
must produce sufficient radiant heat to brown the surface of
the foodstuff, but must not prevent the microwaves
penetrating the bulk of the foodstuff and thoroughly cooking 
it.Most foodstuffs are perishable in normal
environments, reacting with oxygen and moisture with
consequent deterioration in their quality, texture and taste
e.g. due to bacteriological degradation. By packaging such
foodstuffs in a hermetically sealed container with good
barrier to oxygen and moisture, shelf life of the foodstuff
under ambient conditions of temperature and humidity can be
prolonged, often for several months. Since sensitivity to
oxygen and moisture degradation will vary from foodstuff to
foodstuff, there is no categorical definition within the
food packaging industry of what constitutes a barrier
packaging material, but it is generally accepted that in
order to give a worthwhile extension of shelf life, adequate
for the normal retail distribution chain on most perishable
foodstuffs, a barrier packaging material must have

<CLAIMS>
The use of a coated barrier film to provide heating and
browning of a surface of product adjacent the film, which film comprises

a plastics film substrate laminated to paper or board, said plastics film
substrate having a coating thereon comprising an essentially uniform

mixture of a metallic element and an oxide of the metallic element, the
amount of the metallic element distributed throughout the mixture being

sufficiently greater than zero that, during microwaving, the coated film
becomes heated to a stable temperature above 150°C, but below the

melting point or other deterioration point of the coated film.
The use according to claim 1, wherein the plastics film is
poly(ethylene glycol)terephthalate.
The use according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the metal is a non-ferromagnetic
metal such as aluminium.
