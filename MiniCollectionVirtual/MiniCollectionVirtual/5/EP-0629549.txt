<ABSTRACT>
A composite structure having enhanced lightning strike protection. The 
high performance composite substrate is coated with electrically conductive nickel coated 

fibers embedded in a protective paint. By virtue of the nickel coated fibers in paper or 
shredded form, the paint is electrically conductive.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to lightning strike protection in general and, 
more particularly, to an electrically conductive composition for protecting aircraft and 
aerospace components from the catastrophic effects caused by lightning strikes. The use of carbon fiber composites in aircraft and aerospace components is 
expanding because of the very favorable strength to weight ratio compared to aluminum, 
i.e., approximately .75 to .18 Gpa/density. With bare aluminum structures lightning 
strike has not been a major problem. However, when aluminum is painted the lightning 
strike tends to concentrate at one point and some metallurgical damage to the metal 
occurs. Visually, this damage is such that if it is repainted it is not noticeable. However, 
as relatively non-conductive carbon, boron, glass, and aramid fiber composites have been 
introduced with greater frequency for aircraft applications, major problems have arisen 
with regard to lightning. In order to seal the composite from debilitating moisture absorption, the  
 
composite structures are generally painted with a polyurethane base aircraft grade paint. 
Unfortunately, when painted composite materials are struck by lightning the effect is 
catastrophic. Usually a hole about 15 cm-square is blown through the composite panel. 
The size of the hole depends, of course, on the thickness and construction of the panel. In order to overcome this severe damage all at risk composite parts are 
protected against lightning strike. Currently this is accomplished by placing a copper or 
aluminum mesh on top of the fiber epoxy composite, adding extra epoxy and co-curing the 
composite in the normal way. Alternatively, the metallic mesh is adhesively bonded to the 
previously cured epoxy fiber structure and a fill-in layer of epoxy plus a surface layer of 
epoxy is painted on top of the mesh and cured. Aluminum forms a severe corrosion couple with the carbon fiber and 
several layers of glass fiber are usually placed on top of the carbon fiber. However, this 
leads to a severe weight penalty of over 700 g/mÂ² so this system is rarely used. The copper mesh materials must be well bonded to the epoxy-fiber base 
because the coefficient of thermal expansion of copper is 19 parts per million per degree 
Celsius compared to about 1 part per million per degree Celsius for epoxy composites. If 
not properly bonded this difference in expansion coefficients causes microcracking of the 
surface of the epoxy, and corrosion of the copper mesh will ensue. The copper
