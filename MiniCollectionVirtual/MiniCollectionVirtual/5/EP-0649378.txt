<ABSTRACT>
A method and composition of packaging an adhesive composition, especially a thermoplastic or thermosetting hot melt adhesive. The method comprises the steps of providing one substantially uniform separate portion of the adhesive composition; sufficiently solidifying said portion for packaging; and substantially completely surrounding said sufficiently solidified portion with a biodegradable polymeric packaging material. The packaging material being meltable together with the adhesive composition and blendable into said molten adhesive composition, the kind and amount of said biodegradable packaging material being chosen so as not to disadvantageously affect the properties of the adhesive composition when blended into the molten adhesive and applied to a substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
packaging an adhesive composition, especially a 
thermoplastic or thermosetting hot melt adhesive, in a 
biodegradable package which doesn't separate and/or 
degrade upon exposure to conditions present in the 
adhesive application equipment. Thermoplastic adhesives, especially hot melts, 
can be confectioned and packaged as disclosed in German 
patent 22 48 046. Hot melt adhesive is squeeze-cut into 
roughly pillow-shaped pieces, the pieces are 
subsequently cooled and thus solidified and are then put 
into sacks or cartons for packaging. In order to reduce the tendency of the 
individual pillows to stick, i.e. adhere to each other, 
it is known to coat them with a separating, anti-stick 
substance, such as wax or a polymer, as shown in DE 33 
27 289 Kaiser. WO 84/03457 and WO 84/03468, Societe 
Nouvelle Raffinerie Meridionale de Ceresines-Belix, 
disclose a method to outwardly coat autoprotected blocks 
with a powdery separating agent. For thermoplastic 
adhesive compositions with a relatively high softening 
point (above 120°C and especially above 150°C) these 
coatings provide sufficient anti-stick properties. Such 
compositions can therefore be packaged, stored and 
dispensed from sacks without any major sticking 
problems. Another packaging for adhesive compositions is 
to wrap or cast bigger portions of the adhesive in 
plastics film material, such as thick polyethylene film. 
These known packagings have the disadvantage that the 
thermoplastic adhesive composition must be removed from 
the packaging prior to use, which means an extra 
handling step. Further, the packaging material must be 
discarded after emptying, which leads to material waste  
 
and expenditure for disposing of the used packaging 
material. German patent 36 25 358 to Hausdorf discloses a 
method to completely wrap a single solid hot melt 
adhesive material block in a thermoplastic, especially a 
copolyamide film material with a melting point between 
120°C and 150°C, to prevent sticking of the adhesive to 
the internal surfaces of a melting apparatus when 
pressure-melting the adhesive. The film material is 
melted and mixed with the adhesive. This prior art 
centers on copolyamide materials in view of their 
inherent hot melt adhesive properties. Today, 
application temperatures of less than 150°C, preferably 
in the range of 110°C to 140°C are required by the end 
user to reduce thermal degradation problems of the 
adhesive as well as distortion of the substrates used. 
Therefore,

<CLAIMS>
A method of packaging and applying an adhesive 
composition in a biodegradable package, said method 

comprising the steps of: 

a) providing one substantially uniform 
separate portion of the adhesive 

composition; 
b) sufficiently solidifying said portion for 
packaging; 
c) selecting a biodegradable packaging 
material comprising at least a portion of 

polycaprolactone, said packaging material 
having physical characteristics which are 

coimpatible with and do not substantially 
adversely affect the adhesive 

characteristics of a molten mixture of 
said adhesive composition; 
d) substantially completely surrounding said 
sufficiently solidified portion with a 

biodegradable packaging material into a 
packaged adhesive; and 
e) heating said packaged adhesive to form a 
substantially homogeneous mixture and 

applying said homogeneous mixture to a 
substrate, said packaging material having 

properties such that no degrading of the 
packaging material occurs upon 

application. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein said 
packaging material comprises a blend of polycaprolactone 

and a second material, said second material not being 
biodegradable. 
The method according to claim 1, wherein the 
packaging material is a polymeric net weighing between 

0.1 and 5% by weight with respect to the weight of the 
adhesive composition contained in the package.  

 
A packaged adhesive composition, comprising a 
batch of substantially uniform separate portion pieces 

of adhesive composition, said batch being substantially  
 

completely surrounded by a biodegradable packaging 
material comprising at least a portion of 

polycaprolactone, said packaging material being selected 
such that upon heating said batch, said molten packaging 

material having properties such that it does not degrade 
upon being applied through application equipment. 
The composition according to claim 4 the 
separate portion pieces being pillow-shaped and weighing 

between 0.1 and 50 grams. 
The composition according to claim 4, wherein 
said packaging material comprises a blend of 

polycaprolactone and a second polymeric material, said 
second material not being biodegradable.
