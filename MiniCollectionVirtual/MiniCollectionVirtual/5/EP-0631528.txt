Drum pack device for winding continuous material, 
particularly wire, surface-coated wire, insulated wire 

and such like, having
 
an essentially cylindrical, perpendicular winding 

core (2),
 
a laying device, which feeds wire loops onto this 

winding core, the winding core being formed in such a 
way that the bottom wire loops fall onto a winding drum 

(4) arranged under the winding core, as soon as the 
number of wire loops fed on the winding core exceeds a 

pre-determined number,
 
a gripping device, which has at least three holding 

fingers (11, 12, 13, 14) distributed around the 
circumference of the winding core, which are moveable 

relative to the winding core in such a way that during 
the changing of the winding drum they hold the wire 

loops on the winding core,
 
characterised
 
in that a wire positioning device is provided, which 

comprises a rotatable ring (30) arranged concentric to 
the winding core and a number of positioning fingers 

(41, 43, 44) arranged at an angular distance from each 
other and movably guided on this ring,
 
in that a driving device (32, 33, 35) controlled by a 

control device is provided, by means of which the 
rotating ring is rotatable from an initial position, 

which the ring occupies before the drum change, to a  
 

change position, which the ring occupies during the 
drum change,
 
in that a guiding device (47) is provided, through 

which the positioning fingers are guided, the guiding 
device being formed in such a way that the positioning 

fingers are led across from a first position, in which 
they are held at a distance from the winding core, to a 

second position, in which they rest against the winding 
core, this movement of the positioning fingers 

resulting in that, when the positioning fingers have 
passed a first holding finger (11) during the rotation 

from the initial position to another position, their 
position is particularly favourable for the drum 

change, and
 
in that the control device is formed in such a way that 

the rotation of the rotating ring (30) is concluded 
when the first positioning finger (41), which reaches 

the position resting on the winding core (2), is 
situated vertically under the first holding finger 

(11), and
 
in that, after the drum change, the driving device (32, 

33, 35) turns the rotating ring (30) back from this 
change position to the initial position. 
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the number of positioning fingers (41, 43, 44) is the 

same as the number of holding fingers (11, 12, 13, 14) 
reduced by 1 and in that the angular distance of the 

positioning fingers corresponds to the angular distance 
of the holding fingers, no positioning finger being 

located under the second holding finger (12), lying 
behind the first holding finger (11), in the rotational 

direction during the movement from the initial position  
 

to the change position, when the rotating ring is 
located in its change position. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 
2, characterised in that the holding fingers and/or the 

positioning fingers are essentially formed as 
cylindrical rods, whose (imaginary) cylinder axis runs 

through the (imaginary) cylinder axis of the winding 
core. 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the guiding device is formed as a 

connecting link guide (47), and that each positioning 
finger has at least one roller (46), with which it 

supports itself on this connecting link guide (47). 
Device according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the rotating ring (30) is 

essentially cylindrical and is formed with its outer 
circumference as a pulley, which receives a belt (32) 

which is connected to the driving device (35). 
Procedure for the positioning of wire during the 
drum change in a drum pack device, which has an 

essentially cylindrical perpendicular winding core (2), 
onto which wire loops are collected during the changing 

process, which are held by three or more holding 
fingers (11, 12, 13, 14) distributed around the 

circumference of the winding core (2), the winding core 
being formed in such a way that the bottom wire loops 

fall onto a winding drum (4) arranged under the winding 
core, as soon as the number of wire loops fed onto the 

winding core exceeds a pre-determined number,
 
characterised in that a wire positioning device is 

provided, by which the wire wound onto the winding  
 

core, which is connected with the wire on the full 
drum, is held in a position under a first holding 

finger (11), which, during the drum change, has the 
shortest distance from the full drum (4) which has been 

removed from the drum pack device, the wire positioning 
device having a number of positioning fingers (41, 43, 

44), which are guided on a rotatable ring (30) arranged 
concentric to the winding core, and the guiding of 

these positioning fingers is carried out in such a way 
that during the rotation of this ring the positioning 

fingers rest on the winding core as soon as the 
positioning fingers have passed this first holding 

finger (11), and that the rotation of the ring is 
concluded as soon as the first positioning finger (41), 

resting on the winding core during the rotation, is 
located in an essentially angular position, which 

corresponds to the angular position of this first 
holding finger (11).
