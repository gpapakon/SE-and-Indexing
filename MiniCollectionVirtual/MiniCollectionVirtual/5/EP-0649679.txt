<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a tray (6) for a cuvette matrix (1). 
The tray comprises at least one aperture matrix corresponding 

to said cuvette matrix (1), with an aperture (8) for 
each cuvette (2) of the matrix (1). The aperture comprising 

a flexible clamping element (9) keeping said cuvette in 
place by means of friction.The clamping element includes at 

least one flexible finger (9) placed on a wall of the 
aperture (8) that presses the cuvette (2) against the other 

wall (10) of the aperture (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a tray for a cuvette matrix formed
by rows. If necessary, smaller parts of the matrix can be
removed and put back into the tray. The cuvette matrix is
especially suitable for use in different diagnostic
measurements, f.e. for EIA-assays. Cuvette matrices can
f.ex. form a so called microtitration plate.Generally used for diagnostic assays are test plates formed
by rows of cuvettes, f.ex. the so called microtitration
plate into the cuvettes of which the samples are placed.
Mostly used is a standard plate with 8 x 12 cuvettes with a
distribution of 9 mm. Known are also cuvette sets, a smaller
part of which can be removed, if ncessary. Thus, it is not
necessary to use the whole set, if there are only a few
of the samples.US-A-4,154,795 dicloses a microtitration plate the wells
(cuvettes) of which have been connected with one another by
rigid, straight stems right by the well row. The stems can
be broken and in this way it is possible to remove a
necessary amount of wells from the plate. The tray of the
plate is equipped with posts placed in spaces between the
wells. One problem with this solution is the fact that the
wells do not stand upright in the tray properly, when the
tray is moved. F.ex. during stages of washing it is often
necessary to turn the tray upside down, whereby the wells
tend to fall down. Even the fact that the different wells 
are at different heights in the tray can cause difficulties
with the measuring device.GB-A-2 064 998 discloses to a rack for centrifuge tubes
comprising recesses for a plurality of tubes formed by
vertically stackable members, wherein said members include
cut-outs which contain elastic securing elements which fill
a part of the space of the recesses for the tubes, and
wherein the tubes themselves are held fast by the gripping
action of said elastic elements. In particular, the elastic
securing elements are formed of star-shaped rubber plates
which are located in the corners of the recesses for the
tubes. When the tubes are inserted into the recesses, the
tips of the stars come into contact with the tubes and are
deformed within the space between the tubes and the corners
of the recesses.The present invention provides a tray with space for at
least one cuvette matrix having at least one line or row of
cuvettes, said tray comprising at least one aperture matrix
corresponding to said cuvette matrix, with an aperture for
each cuvette of the matrix, said apertures forming rows and
columns delimited by a frame with integral separation walls, the

<CLAIMS>
A tray with space for at least one cuvette matrix having
at least one line or row of cuvettes (2), said tray

comprising at least one aperture matrix corresponding to
said cuvette matrix, with an aperture (8) for each cuvette

of the matrix, said apertures forming rows and columns,
characterised in that said apertures are

delimited by a frame (6) with integral separation walls (9, 10), the

separation walls parallel with the columns being
rigid, and every second wall separating the rows being

vertically cut off at the centre line of the column, forming
a gap between the cut-off ends to form a flexible clamping

element comprising at least one flexible finger
for pressing the cuvette (2) against the rigid frame and keeping

the cuvette in the aperture (8) with the help of friction.
The tray as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
there is only one finger (9) for each cuvette (2).
The tray as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the aperture (8) is quadratic in

cross-section.
