<ABSTRACT>
An objective lens driving biaxial actuator for 
driving an objective lens in both a focusing direction and a 

tracking direction with respect to a recording medium 
comprises: a movable portion (20) for holding the objective lens; 

an elastic member (28) having its one end attached to the movable 
portion for supporting the movable portion movably; a 

stationary portion fixing the other end of the elastic 
member; and a balancer (B) disposed at the side of the 

stationary portion with respect to the objective lens and 
carried on the movable portion at such a distance that its 

clearance from the stationary portion may restrict the 
deformation of the elastic member within an elastic limit. 

A hinge (32) interposed between the elastic member and the 
movable portion permits movement of the objective lens in 

the tracking direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a biaxial
actuator for operating a movable portion, which includes an
objective lens for focusing a beam of light coming from a
light source such as a semiconductor laser on the signal
surface of an optical disk, in both a focusing direction and
a tracking direction.In the prior art, an optical pick up device has
been used as means for reading out an information signal
recorded on an optical disk or writing information on the
disk by applying a beam of light to the signal surface of
the disk which is being driven by a disk drive device.This optical pickup device is equipped with the
biaxial actuator. In this biaxial actuator, the beam of
light emanating from a light source such as a semiconductor
laser can be applied in focus to the signal surface of the
optical disk precisely along the recording track, by
displacing the objective lens, which is used for focusing
the beam of light on the signal surface of the disk, in
biaxial directions of the focusing direction and the
tracking direction by a magnetic drive force.This prior art biaxial actuator has a structure,
as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of the accompanying drawings.In Figs. 1 and 2, the biaxial actuator is equipped
with a movable portion 1 and a stationary portion 2. The
movable portion 1 is so supported with respect to the
stationary portion 2 by an elastic support mechanism, which
is interposed between the two portions 1 and 2, as to follow
a fluctuation due to the motion of the optical disk. The
movable portion 1 is equipped with an objective lens L
called the "read lens" and a lens holder 3 supporting the
objective lens L.The lens holder 3 of the movable portion 1 is
supported by a leaf spring 4 for controlling the focusing 
operation of the elastic support mechanism. Specifically,
the lens holder 3 is supported by one end of the leaf spring
4 through a tracking hinge 6 of the elastic support
mechanism. The other end of the leaf spring 4 is fixed to a
yoke 5 of the stationary portion 2.In case the movable portion 1 is subjected to the
tracking operation in the tracking direction TR, it moves on
the pin of the tracking hinge 6. On the other hand, when
the movable portion 1 is subjected to the focusing operation
in the focusing direction FC, it is moved by the elastic
deformation of the leaf spring 4.Moreover, the movable portion 1 carries a balancer
B thereon. This balancer B is provided for balancing the
weight of the objective lens L in the two focusing and
tracking directions.However, the prior art biaxial

An objective lens driving biaxial actuator for
driving an objective lens (L) in both a focusing direction

(FC) and a tracking direction (TR) with respect to a
recording medium, comprising:


a movable portion (20), movable in both said focusing
and tracking directions, for holding said objective lens

(L);
an elastic member (28;71) having one end attached to
a stationary portion (22) and the other end attached to

said movable portion for movably supporting said movable
portion relative to said stationary portion (22) in at

least said focusing direction; and
a balancer (B) for balancing the weight of the
objective lens during focusing and tracking movement,

disposed on said movable portion (20) in the direction of
said one end from said objective lens (L) ; characterised in

that
said balancer is disposed at such a position and
shaped so that its clearance (H) from said stationary

portion (22) during tracking movement restricts possible
deformation of said elastic member (28) due to movement of

said movable portion (20) in response to an impact towards said stationary portion
(22) to be within the elastic limit thereof.
An objective lens driving biaxial actuator according
to claim 1, wherein said elastic member includes a leaf

spring (28;71) for moving said objective lens (L) in the
focusing direction (FC).
An objective lens driving biaxial actuator according
to claim 2, wherein the face (50) of said balancer (B)

opposed to said stationary portion (38) is curved to
establish such a distance that the closest position of said

opposed face (50) to said stationary portion (38) when said 
movable portion (20) turns in the tracking direction (TR)

restricts the deformation of said leaf spring (28;71)
within the elastic limit.
An objective lens driving biaxial actuator according
to any one of the preceding claims, further comprising:

a hinge (32) interposed between said elastic member
(28) and said movable portion (20) for moving said

objective lens (L) in the tracking direction (TR).

substantially equal distance (R) from the pin (44) of said

hinge (32).

during tracking movement remains constant.
