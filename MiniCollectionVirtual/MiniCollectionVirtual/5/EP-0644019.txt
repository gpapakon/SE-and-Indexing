<ABSTRACT>
A process for tumbling needle blanks (10 or 20) either before (10) or 
after (20) suture holes have been drilled into the respective 

needle blanks (10 or 20) preferably tumbling occurs with smooth, e.g. 
ceramic or glass spherical media, or soft media.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of mechanically
treating needle blanks used for fabrication into surgical
needles, and more particularly to a method for deburring and
chamfering said needle blanks.For many years, surgeons have employed needle-suture
combinations in which a suture or ligature is attached to the
shank end of a needle. Such needle-suture combinations are
provided for a wide variety of monofilament and braided suture
materials, both absorbable and nonabsorbable, e.g., catgut,
silk, nylon, polyester, polypropylene, linen, cotton, and
absorbable synthetic materials such as polymers and copolymers
of glycolic and lactic acids.Needle-suture combinations fall into two general classes:
standard needle attachment and removable or detachable needle
attachment. In the case of standard needle attachment, the
suture is securely attached to the needle and is not intended
to be separable therefrom, except by cutting or severing the
suture. Removable needle attachment, by contrast, is such
that the needle is separable from the suture in response to a
force exerted by the surgeon. Minimum acceptable forces
required to separate a needle from a suture (for various
suture sizes) are set forth in the United States Pharmacopoeia
(USP). The United States Pharmacopoeia prescribes minimum
individual pull-out forces as measured for five needle-suture
combinations. The minimum pull-out forces for both standard 
and removable needle-suture attachment set forth in the United
States Pharmacopoeia are hereby incorporated by reference.On typical method for securing a suture to a needle
involves providing a cylindrical recess in the shank end of a
needle and securing a suture therein. For example, U.S.
Patent No. 1,558,037 teaches the addition of a cement material
to such a substantially cylindrical recess to secure the
suture therein. Additional methods for bonding a suture
within a needle bore are described in U.S. Patent Nos.
2,928,395 (adhesives) and 3,394,704 (bonding agents).
Alternatively, a suture may be secured within an axial bore in
a needle by swaging the needle in the region of the recess.
See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 1,250,114. Additional prior art
methods for securing a suture within a needle bore include
expansion of a catgut suture through the application of heat
(U.S. Patent No. 1,665,216), inclusion of protruding teeth
within the axial bore to grasp an inserted suture (U.S. Patent
No. 1,678,361) and knotting the end of the suture to be
inserted within the bore to secure the suture therein

<CLAIMS>
A process for deburring and reducing sharp edges of
polished needle blanks, comprising:


tumbling said polished needle blanks with media having a surface
softer than the needle blanks for sufficient time to deburr

said needle blanks and simultaneously retain the polish of
said needle blanks.
The process of Claim 1, wherein the media has a diameter
from about 0.5 millimeters to about 10 millimeters.
The process of Claim 2, wherein the media have a particle
diameter of about 4 to about 8mm and the needle blanks have a

diameter from about 18 to about 30 mils.
The process of Claim 2, wherein the media have a particle
diameter of about 1 to about 3mm and the needle blanks have a

diameter from about 17 to about 10 mils.
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
said media comprises wood, walnut shells or ground corn cob.
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
said media further comprises a powder of silica or lime.
The process of Claim 6, wherein the powder has a particle
diameter wherein at least 98% of the particles are less than

200 mesh.
The process of any one of the preceding claims, wherein
an abrasive liquid is added to the media to be present during

said tumbling.
