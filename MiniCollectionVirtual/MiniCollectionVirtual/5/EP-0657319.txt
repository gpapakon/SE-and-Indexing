<ABSTRACT>
An accelerator pedal arrangement including a 
stationary member (10), a shaft (28) having an axis (X) 

and supported by the stationary member (10) for rotation 
about the axis (X), an accelerator pedal (36) connected 

to the shaft (28) for unitary rotation therewith about 
the axis (X), a return spring (56) biasing the 

accelerator pedal (36) in a first rotational direction 
toward a released position (R), and a brake operative to 

resist rotational movement of the accelerator pedal (36), 
characterized in that the brake is in the form of a one-way 

brake (63) which is operative to resist movement of 
the accelerator pedal (36) in the first rotational 

direction, but allowing free movement of the accelerator 
pedal (36) in the opposite second rotational direction 

against the return spring (56).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrically controlled accelerator pedal arrangement for
a vehicle.Accelerator pedal arrangements for a vehicle
are generally known and includes a mechanically
controlled type and an electrically controlled type.One example of the electrically controlled
accelerator pedal arrangements referred to in the preamble of claim 1
is disclosed in Japanese
Utility Model Application Second Publication No. 5-7620.
The prior art arrangement includes a stationary member, a
shaft which has an axis and is supported by the
stationary member for rotation about the axis. An
accelerator pedal is connected to the shaft for unitary
rotation therewith about the axis. A return spring
biases the accelerator pedal in a rotational direction
toward a released position. A brake operative to resist
rotational movement of the accelerator pedal is provided.
The brake includes friction pads attached to the
stationary member, a slide plate which is linked to the
accelerator pedal and engages the friction pads, and a
spring biasing the slide plate in frictional engagement
with the friction pads.There is a demand for an electrically
controlled accelerator pedal arrangement in which the
accelerator pedal can be held at a desirable position by
a reduced depressing force applied thereto against a
biasing force of the return spring.An object of the present invention is to
provide an improved operating performance of the
electrically controlled accelerator pedal arrangements 
during the movement of the accelerator pedal to the
released position.Another object of the present invention is to
provide a simplified structure of the electrically
controlled accelerator pedal arrangement, thereby serving
for easy assembly and a reduction in size.According to one aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an accelerator pedal
arrangement comprising:
a stationary member;a shaft having an axis, the shaft being
supported by the stationary member for rotation about the
axis;an accelerator pedal connected to the shaft for
unitary rotation therewith about the axis;a return spring (56) biasing the accelerator
pedal in a first rotational direction toward a released
position; anda brake operative to resist rotational movement
of the accelerator pedal;CHARACTERIZED IN THAT the brake is in the form of a one-way
brake which is operative to resist movement of the
accelerator pedal in the first rotational direction, but
allowing free movement of the accelerator pedal in the
opposite second rotational direction against

An accelerator pedal arrangement comprising:

a stationary member (10, 110);
a shaft (28, 126) having an axis (X), said
shaft (28, 126) being supported by said stationary member

 said brake is in the form of a one-way
brake (63, 136) which is operative to resist movement

of said accelerator pedal (36) in said first rotational
direction, but allowing free movement of said accelerator

pedal (36) in the opposite second rotational direction
against said return spring (56).
An accelerator pedal arrangement as claimed in
claim 1, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said brake includes a one-way

clutch (64) mounted on said shaft (28).
An accelerator pedal arrangement as claimed in
claim 2, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said brake includes a

friction disk (68) secured to said one-way clutch (64),
and a wall (22) fixed to said stationary member (10),

said friction disk (68) including a base plate (72) and a
friction pad (74) attached to the base plate (72).
An accelerator pedal arrangement as claimed in 
claim 3, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said brake includes means

(66, 44, 48, 50) for biasing said friction disk into
frictional engagement with said wall (22).
An accelerator pedal arrangement as claimed in
claim 4, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said biasing means

includes a shoulder (66) with which said shaft (28) is
formed, said shoulder (66) abutting against said one-way

clutch (64).
An accelerator pedal arrangement as claimed in
claim 3, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said friction pad (74) has

a rounded surface (82).
An accelerator pedal arrangement as claimed in
claim 1, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said brake includes said

shaft (126) and means for restraining rotational movement
of said shaft (126).

claim 7, CHARACTERIZED IN THAT said preventing means

includes a pivot member (137) pivotally supported by said
stationary member (110), a spring (142) biasing said

pivot member (137) into frictional engagement with said
shaft (126), and a stop (156) arranged to abut said pivot

member (137) to prevent said pivot member (137) from
following the rotational movement of said shaft (126)

during the movement of said accelerator pedal (36) in
said second rotational direction.
