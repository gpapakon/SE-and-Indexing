<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
making a nonwoven polyolefin sheet which is useful as a
primary carpet backing in moldable carpets. More
particularly, the invention relates to a process for
making a polypropylene primary carpet backing useful in
moldable, tufted automotive carpets.Presently, most automotive carpets are manufactured
using a polyester primary carpet backing. Polyester
primary carpet backings have sufficiently high
elongation and more plastic than elastic behavior. This
type of behavior sustains stretching during carpet
molding without tearing and allows the backing to remain
dimensionally stable after demolding. The high glass
transition temperature for polyester (about 80 degrees C
for polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) means that
polyester fibers made therefrom will be dimensionally
stable following the molding operation. As a result,
after a molded carpet is made from a polyester primary
carpet backing, the carpet will retain its shape with
little tendency to shrink. In the past, polyester
primary carpet backings have been the product of choice
in the automotive industry due to their moldability and
dimensional stability.Polyolefin fibers, especially polypropylene fibers,
are used in making primary backings for broadloom
carpets. Polyolefins are less expensive than polyesters. 
In addition, polyolefins are easier to recycle than
polyesters, due to their lower melting point, permitting
melting, filtration and re-extrusion at temperatures which
generally do not lead to polymer degradation. With
increased emphasis on using recyclable materials, and the
need to use the lowest priced materials available, it
would be very desirable to be able to utilize polyolefin
carpets in the automotive industry.The polypropylene carpet backings used in broadloom
carpets do not have sufficient elongation to be molded
into shapes suitable for automotive carpets. Typically,
the backing will tear during the molding operation. If the
draw ratio of the polypropylene fibers is increased in
order to increase the strength, the elongation goes down.
The higher drawing process also gives higher
crystallinity, exacerbating instability problems (tendency
of the backing to grow or shrink) due to the lower glass
transition point of polypropylene (0 degrees C). Even if
one were able to mold a polypropylene carpet backing
without tearing, the molded product will tend to curl
and/or lose its shape immediately or shortly after
demolding due to the elastic nature of the polypropylene
fibers. As a result, in

A process for making a molded carpet from a
nonwoven sheet consisting essentially of 100% polyolefin

filaments, comprising the steps of:

(a) melt spinning a bundle of polyolefin
filaments (3) from a plurality of spinnerets (5);
(b) drawing the filaments (3) at a draw ratio of
less than 2.0 and depositing the drawn filaments (13) onto

a moving collection device (35) in both the machine (M)
and cross-machine (X) directions to form a nonwoven sheet

having a unit weight of 100 to 150 g/m
2
;
(c) lightly bonding the nonwoven sheet to an
extent sufficient to achieve sheet integrity but not to an

extent where filament movement and sheet delamination are
prevented when the nonwoven sheet is subsequently needled;
(d) needling the nonwoven sheet to cause sheet
delamination and filament movement to occur and to

substantially increase the elongation of the resulting
needled nonwoven sheet beyond that due to selection of the

draw ratio, the elongation of the sheet being increased to
at least 40% at the maximum force in both the machine and

cross directions; and
(e) molding the needled sheet of step (d) into a
desired shape.
The process according to claim 1 wherein
needling is accomplished by punching smooth needles into

the lightly bonded nonwoven sheet.
The process according to claim 1 wherein
needling is accomplished by tufting yarns (42) into the

lightly bonded nonwoven sheet (41).
The process according to claim 3 wherein the
following additional steps are performed after step (d)

but before step (e):

(d1) applying a locking agent (43) to the needled
sheet (41) to lock the tufting yarns (42) into the sheet; 
(d2) applying a backcoat (44) to the sheet
produced by step (dl) to provide rigidity to the sheet;

and
(d3) applying a secondary backing (45) to the
backcoated side of the sheet produced by step (d2).
The process according to claim 4 wherein the
locking agent (43) is selected from the group consisting

of a latex, an atactic polypropylene and an ethylene vinyl
acetate.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the
resulting nonwoven sheet produced by step (d) has an

elongation of between 50% and 100% at the maximum force in
both the machine and cross-machine directions.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the
nonwoven sheet is needled to the extent that sheet

thickness is increased to between 2.5 and 3.5 times the
thickness of the lightly bonded nonwoven sheet of step

(c).
The process according to claim 1 wherein the
polyolefin comprises isotactic polypropylene.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the
lightly bonded nonwoven sheet is heat stabilized before

needling by heating the sheet at a temperature and for a
period of time sufficient to relax the sheet in both the

machine and cross-machine directions.
A needled, nbnwoven polyolefin sheet (41)
useful as a primary carpet backing in moldable carpets, the sheet comprising

substantially continuous filaments
(13) of a polyolefin of 5 to 30 dtex, the filaments having

directionality in both a machine and a cross-machine
direction, the filaments having been drawn at a draw ratio

less than 2.0, the sheet having been lightly bonded to an
extent to achieve sheet integrity and subsequently needled

to cause sheet delamination and filament movement to
occur, said needling serving to increase the elongation

capacity of the sheet, said needled sheet having a unit 
weight of 100 to 150 g/m

directions.
