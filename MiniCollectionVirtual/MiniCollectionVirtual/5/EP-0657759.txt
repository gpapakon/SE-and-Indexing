<ABSTRACT>
A processing fixture and method of fabricating micromechanical 
devices, such as digital micromirror devices, that allows fragile structures on 

wafer 
22
 to be protected from debris during the saw operation and 
subsequent cleaning operations. The wafer 
22
 is attached to a vacuum 
fixture 
26
 after partially sawing the wafer 
22
 to create saw kerfs. The 
backside of the wafer 
22
 is then ground down to the saw kerfs 
24
 to separate 
the devices 
32
. Each device 
32
 is held on the fixture by a vacuum in the 
headspace above the device 
32
. In an alternate embodiment the devices are 
separated by sawing completely through the wafer while in the fixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of integrated circuit processing, more
particularly to micromechanical device fabrication, including deformable
micromirror devices.In order for integrated circuit (IC) processing to be cost effective, the
individual circuits, or chips, should be mass produced by using a
semiconductor wafer to make many chips on a single substrate
simultaneously. Typical processing for microelectronic mechanical systems
(MEMS) involves extensive chip handling during processes such as the
sacrificial layer removal and device testing. The ability to perform these
processes in wafer form as opposed to chip form is very attractive. Carrying
out the processing at the wafer level reduces the handling necessary because
processing equipment must only move and align one wafer instead of many
chips. Alignment, or registration, is very critical for die testing. After all
wafer level processing has been done, the chips are separated and packaged.
When the devices are separated from a wafer, wafer particles and dust, also
known as dicing debris, is created. This dicing debris is then typically
washed from the surface of the IC prior to bonding the chip to the package. A semiconductor wafer dicing fixture is known from
US-A-3,976,288. This document discloses apparatus for
retaining a semiconductor wafer in a predetermined position
or orientation to permit dicing of the wafer into discrete
semiconductor chips of a predetermined size without
dislocation of the chips during the dicing operation, the
chips being arranged in columns and rows with a kerf area
intermediate adjacent chips. The apparatus comprises a base
member having a semiconductor wafer positioning area with a
connection to the base member for applying the vacuum to a
plurality of spaced apart apertures in the wafer receiving
area, the apertures corresponding to the location of the
chips. A cover plate, adapted for superimposition of the
wafer receiving area, includes a plurality of interdigitated
ribs and slots, the slots extending through the cover and
dimensioned for alignment with the kerf area of the wafer,
the ribs having strips of compressible material underlying
the ribs for superimposed pressing relation on the wafer so
that when a wafer is being cut through the slots along the
kerf area, the vacuum being drawn coupled with the pressing
engagement of the strips on the wafer inhibit disclocation
of the chips during the dicing operation. Micromechanical devices often have structures that are too fragile to
survive exposure to some

A fixture for protecting a wafer (22; 34) comprised
of at least two micromechanical devices, each

micromechanical device comprised of at least one fragile

portion, the fixture (26) comprising:

a surface for contacting the wafer (22; 34), the
surface comprised of a plurality of recessed regions for

preventing contact between the surface and the wafer (22;
34) such that when the surface of the fixture (26; 36) is in

contact with the wafer (22; 34), each recessed region of the
surface forms a headspace (28) above the fragile portion of

one of the micromechnical devices;
at least one vacuum port (30; 40) connected to the
headspaces (28) to allow evacuation of the headspaces (28);

and
the surface of the fixture (26; 36) forming a seal
around each micromechanical device, thereby allowing each

headspace (28) to be evacuated through the vacuum port (30;
40) connected to the headspace (28).
