<ABSTRACT>
A new type of chicken feed (A) based on a powder form 
of eicosapentanoic acid and/or docosahexanoic acid 

uniformly mixed with an ordinary chicken feed is provided 
which does not significantly reduce egg production rates 

(P) over time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chicken feed. It is well known that two types of fatty acids known as eicosapentaenoic 
acid, hereinafter referred to as EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid, hereinafter 
referred to as DHA, decrease the level of cholesterol inside the body upon 
consumption. These two fatty acids, EPA and DHA, present in the skin, 
tissue, and organs of various fish such as mackerels and 
herrings, are extracted and maintained as liquid in the 
presence of other liquid fatty acids. A liquid-based EPA and 
DHA fortified chicken feed has previously been prepared by spraying 
a fatty acid solution containing EPA and DHA on a batch of chicken feed 
continuously stirred. Feeding the chickens the fortified chicken feed results 
in producing EPA and DHA enriched chicken eggs that help decrease the 
level of cholesterol upon consumption. However, a continuous feeding of the liquid-based EPA and DHA fortified 
chicken feed results in decreasing the egg production rate, and this 
necessarily increases the cost of the liquid-based EPA and DHA enriched 
chicken eggs. The decrease observed in the egg production rate is believed  
 
to be rooted in the high fat content of the solution containing EPA and DHA. 
It is believed that the ingestion of the fortified chicken feed leads to an 
unbalanced high fat diet that contributes to deteriorating the health of the 
chickens and, consequently, to decreasing the egg production rate. Also, since the solution containing EPA and DHA is subject to rapid 
oxidation when exposed to air, the EPA and DHA solution at the site of a 
chicken farm must be handled with extreme care. Since it is not possible to 
prepare and stock a large batch of the liquid-based EPA and DHA fortified 
chicken feed because of rapid oxidation, only a quantity necessary for 
immediate feeding needs is prepared using the carefully preserved EPA and 
DHA solution. Thus, efficiency is compromised in the chicken farm business 
because the fortified chicken feed cannot be stocked but must be prepared 
repeatedly, and the EPA and DHA solution must be preserved under a very 
strict condition. This less efficiency also contributes to the high cost of the 
liquid-based EPA and DHA enriched chicken eggs. Another problem associated with the liquid-based EPA and DHA is that it 
is difficult to mix the solution uniformly with the chicken feed, causing the 
quantity of EPA and DHA ingested by the chickens to range widely. This, in 
turn, results in large differences in the concentration of EPA and DHA in the 
liqu

<CLAIMS>
A chicken feed comprising a regular chicken feed and an additive powder 
mixture containing eicosapentaenoic acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid. 
The chicken feed according to Claim 1, wherein said additive powder 
mixture is uniformly mixed in an amount permitting a constant rate of 

chicken egg production during an entire feeding period of said chicken feed. 
The chicken feed according to Claims 1 or 2, wherein said 
additive powder mixture comprises approximately 1.5% by weight 

of said chicken feed. 
The chicken feed according to Claims 1,2 or 3, wherein a 
total fat content of said chicken feed is less than 5% by weight. 
A method of incorporating eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic 
acid into chicken eggs comprising feeding chickens a regular chicken feed 

admixed with a powder form of eicosapentaenoic acid and/or 
docosahexaenoic acid. 
The method in Claim 5 wherein said powder form of eicosapentaenoic 
acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid is admixed to said chicken feed in an 

amount permitting a constant rate of chicken egg production during an entire 
feeding period of said chicken feed admixed with said powder form.
