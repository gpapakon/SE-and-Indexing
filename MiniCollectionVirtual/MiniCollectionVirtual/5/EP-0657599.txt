<ABSTRACT>
An articulated-arm awning with a load-bearing framework in which an awning-canvas shaft is mounted rotatably, with articulated arms mounted pivotably in brackets, and with an opening-out rod which tensions the end of the canvas and is connected in an articulated manner to the lower arm of the articulated arm. The technical problem is increasing the opening-out length while maintaining the stability of an articulated-arm awning. At least one arm (upper arm 4 and/or lower arm 5) of each articulated arm (3) forms, in the stretched-out position, an essentially right angle with the opening-out rod (7) and has a telescoping device which is prestressed in the opening-out direction.

<CLAIMS>
Hinged arm awning with a support frame, in which a cloth roller is rotatably mounted, with
hinged arms, which are pivotably mounted in brackets, and with a deployment rod, which tensions the

end of the cloth and is flexibly connected to the bottom arm of the hinged arms, whereby at least one
arm (top arm 4 and/or bottom arm 5) of each hinged arm (3) forms an essentially right angle with the

deployment rod (7) in the unfolded position, characterized in that one arm (4, 5) at least comprises a
telescopic device which is preloaded in the deployment direction.
Hinged arm awning according to claim 1, characterised in that the telescopic device is arranged
in the top arm (4).
Hinged arm awning according to claim 1, characterised in that the telescopic device is arranged
in the bottom arm (5).
Hinged arm awning according to claim 1, characterised in that the telescopic device comprises
two tubular sectional parts (8, 9) which can slide in one another.

spring (12), is provided to preload the telescopic device.
Hinged arm awning according to claim 1, characterised in that an unlocking device which is
automatically released in the unfolded position is provided for the telescopic device.
Hinged arm awning according to claim 1, characterised in that a locking device which is active
in the unfolded position is provided for the hinged joint.
Hinged arm awning according to claim 7, characterised in that a rod which engages in a recess
in the top arm and comprises an actuating lever which is actuated by the telescopic device in the retracted

position is provided as a locking device in the bottom arm.
Hinged arm awning according to claim 7, characterised in that a folding trigger device which
acts as the cloth is retracted is provided for each hinged joint.
