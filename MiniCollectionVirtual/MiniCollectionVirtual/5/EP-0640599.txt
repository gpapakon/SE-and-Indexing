<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to 4-aminopyrimidine
derivatives and their preparation and use.More particularly, this invention provides
4-aminopyrimidine derivatives of the formula:

wherein the symbols are as hereinafter defined, and their
salts which are useful as inhibitors of cyclic guanosine
3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase, or additionally of
thromboxane A2 synthetase, and
processes for their preparation and their use.Cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (abbreviated as
cGMP hereafter) was found in urine in rats by D. F. Ashman
in 1963. Till now, it has been known that cGMP is
distributed broadly in tissues of many animals including
human beings. cGMP is biosynthesized from guanosine
triphosphate (GTP) by the action of guanylate cyclase. cGMP has been experimentally confirmed to have
various physiological activities. For example, cGMP
induces the relaxation of heart muscle and of smooth
muscle. Further, it is related to the formation of
neuronal synapses, and it acts as a trigger of cell
proliferation and it induces the proliferation of
lymphocyte.cGMP is metabolized to physiologically inactive
5'-GMP by the action of cGMP phosphodiesterase (abbreviated
as cGMP-PDE hereafter).Accordingly, the inhibition of the action of cGMP-PDE
is considered to be useful for the prevention and/or
treatment of diseases induced by enhancement of the
metabolism of cGMP, such as hypertension, heart failure,
myocardial infarction, angina, atherosclerosis, cardiac
edema, pulmonary hypertension, renal insufficiency,
nephrotic edema, hepatic edema, asthma, bronchitis,
dementia, immunodeficiency.On the other hand, thromboxane A2 (abbreviated as
TXA2 hereafter) was found as a constituent of the
arachidonate cascade, in platelets by M. Hamberg in 1975.
TXA2 is biosynthesized from arachidonic acid released from
cell membrane via prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2,
and rapidly metabolized to inactive thromboxane B2. TXA2
is known to induce platelet aggregation and to contract
smooth muscle, particularly blood vessel muscle and
bronchial muscle. TXA2 synthetase was isolated and 
purified from microsome in platelets.Accordingly, the inhibition of TXA2 synthetase
decreases the biosynthesis of TXA2. Inhibitors of TXA2
synthetase are therefore useful in the manufacture of a
medicament for use in the prevention and/or treatment of
inflammation, hypertension, thrombosis, arteriosclerosis,
cerebral apoplexy, asthma, myocardial infarction,
cardiostenosis, cerebral infarction, etc.It is considered that almost any disease occurs
