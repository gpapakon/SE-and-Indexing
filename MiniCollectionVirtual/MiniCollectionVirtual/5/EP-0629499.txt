<ABSTRACT>
In a paper-strand inlet in a longitudinal folding funnel of a rotary printing machine, the object is to provide a slip-free transport of the paper strand by means of a draw-roller drive of low overall height before inlet into a longitudinal folding funnel. This is carried out, according to the invention, in that paper-guide rollers driven at a distance one behind the other on the same or in different planes so as to act on the paper-web strand are provided, as seen in the strand running direction, and in that at least one draw-roller group is provided between two paper-guide rollers. At the same time, the paper-web strand is partially looped round the paper-guide roller near the funnel at an angle  alpha  and round the paper-guide roller remote from the funnel at an angle  beta .

Entry of a paper strip into a former for longitudinal 
folding having two adjacent paper guiding rollers defining a 

paper strip path for the paper strip and arranged at a spacing 
from one another for diverting the paper strip in opposition to 

one another, one of the paper guiding rollers being arranged 
close to the former for longitudinal folding and the other being 

arranged remote from the former for longitudinal folding, 
characterized in that at least one drivable drawing roller group 

(6; 21), which does not divert the paper strip path, is provided 
in the paper strip path of the paper strip (10), between the two 

adjacent paper guiding rollers (2; 3). 
Paper strip entry according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the paper guiding rollers (2; 3) are arranged on the same 

plane. 
Paper strip entry according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the paper guiding rollers (2; 3) are arranged on different 

planes. 
Paper strip entry according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the drawing roller group (6, 21) comprises in each case 

a drawing roller (7) and a plurality of drawing rolls (9) each 
pressing against the drawing roller (7). 
Paper strip entry according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the angle (α, β) at which the paper webs (4, 5) contact 

the paper guiding roller (2) close to the former and the paper 
guiding roller (3) remote from the former is virtually the same. 
Paper strip entry according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the drawing roller (7) is divided into four quarter 

widths in its axial direction, and in that in each case a drawing  
 

roll (9) is associated with each quarter width, at both ends of 
the latter. 
Paper strip entry according to Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the paper guiding rollers (2, 3), the drawing roller (7) 

and the drawing rolls (9) may be driven, in each case at the same 
peripheral speed, by means of a drive. 
Paper strip entry according to Claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that a circular knife (13) or a skip-slitter (17) is 

associated in each case with one of the paper guiding rollers (2, 
3).
