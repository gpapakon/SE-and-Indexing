<DESCRIPTION>
This present invention relates to an electron
source comprising a surface conduction type electron
emitting element and an image forming apparatus such as
a display apparatus as an application of the electron
source and, more particularly, to a method of
manufacturing the same and a method of driving the same.As conventional emitting elements, two types of
elements, i.e., a thermonic cathode element and a cold
cathode element are known. Of these elements, as a cold
cathode element, a field emission type element (to be
abbreviated as an FE type hereinafter), a metal-insulating
layer-metal type emitting element (to be
abbreviated as an MIM type hereinafter), a surface
conduction type emitting element, and the like are
known.As an example of the FE type, for example, W. P.
Dyke & W. W. Dolan, "Field emission", Advances in
Electron Physics, 8, 89, (1956), C. A. Spindt, "Physical
properties of thin-film field emission cathodes with 
molybdenum cones", J. Appl. Phys., 47, 52488 (1976), or
the like is known.As an example of the MIM type, for example, C. A.
Mead, "Operation of tunnel-emission Devices", J. Appl.
Phys., 32, 646 (1981), or the like is known.As the surface conduction type emitting element, for
example, M. I. Elinson, Radio Eng. Electron Phys., 10,
1290(1965), or another example to be described below is
known.The surface conduction type emitting element
utilizes a phenomenon in which electron emission takes
place upon supplying a current to a small-area thin film
formed on a substrate in a direction parallel to the
film surface. As the surface conduction type emitting
element, other than the above-mentioned element using an
SnO2 thin film of Elinson, an element using an Au thin
film [G. Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", 9, 317 (1972)], an
element using an In2O3/SnO2 thin film [M. Hartwell and
C. G. Fonstad: "IEEE Trans. ED Conf.", 519 (1975)], an
element using a carbon thin film [Hisashi Araki, et al.:
Vacuum, Vol. 26, No. 1, 22 (1983)], and the like have
been reported.Fig. 39 is a plan view showing the above-mentioned
element of M. Hartwell et al. as an example of the
typical element structure of these surface conduction
type emitting elements. Referring to Fig. 39, reference 
numeral 3001 denotes a substrate; and 3004, a conductive
thin film consisting of a metal oxide formed by
sputtering. The conductive thin film 3004 has an H-character
planar shape, as shown in Fig. 39. When the
conductive thin film 3004 is subjected to an
energization treatment called energization forming (to
be described later),
