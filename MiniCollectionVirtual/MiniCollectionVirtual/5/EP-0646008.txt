<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to
the use of anti-progestin for the manufacture of a medicament
for minimizing breakthrough bleeding in
users of progestin-only pharmaceutic preparations,
such as contraceptives.The primate menstrual cycle is characterized
by a proliferation and regression of the uterine
lining under the control of steroid hormones,
primarily estrogen and progesterone. It is
believed that the staggered cyclic levels of
hormones contribute to the growth and shedding of
the upper tissue compartment of the uterus.The endometrium on the uterus is characterized
by distinct layers, such as the stratum
functionalis and stratum basalis. It is the
functionalis which represents the transient upper
tissue compartment that is shed during
menstruation.It is believed that the basalis serves as a
source of new cells for the regeneration of the
functionalis in succeeding cycles. Wilborn &
Flowers, Seminars in Reproductive Endocrinology
2:4, 307, 1984; Padykula et al., Biology of
Reproduction 40, 681, 1989. If the basalis does
serve as a germinal layer, then the effects of
damage to the basalis during a given cycle could be
manifest in succeeding cycles.Because endometrial proliferation serves to
prepare the uterus for an impending pregnancy,
manipulation of hormones and of the uterine
environment can serve as suitable targets for 
contraception. For example, estrogens are known to
decrease follicle stimulating hormone secretion by
feedback inhibition.Under certain circumstances, estrogens can
also inhibit luteinizing hormone secretion, once
again by negative feedback, although under normal
circumstances it is believed that the spike of
circulating estrogen found just prior to ovulation
induces the surge of gonadotrophin hormones that
occurs just prior to and resulting in ovulation.
High doses of estrogen also can prevent conception
probably due to interference with implantation.Progesterone is responsible for the
progestational changes of the endometrium and the
cyclic changes of cells and tissues in the cervix
and the vagina. For example, progesterone makes
the cervical mucus thick, tenacious and cellular.
It is believed that thickened mucus impedes
spermatozoal transport.Progesterone has somewhat of an
anti-estrogenic effect on the myometrial cells, for
example, decreasing the excitability of the smooth
muscle cells, and the like. It is known that large
doses of progesterone inhibit luteinizing hormone
secretion and progesterone injections can prevent
ovulation in humans.The most prevalent form of oral
