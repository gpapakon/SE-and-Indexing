<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the oxo process and, in 
particular, to the catalyst cycle of the oxo process. 
That is, it relates to a method for removing metal-containing 
catalyst residues, for example, cobalt-containing 
residues, from crude oxo products and 
recovering therefrom catalyst residues in a form suitable 
for recycle to the oxo reaction. Oxo reactions (also referred to as hydroformylation 
reactions) involve the preparation of oxygenated organic 
compounds by the reaction of a carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen mixture ("syn gas") with carbon compounds 
containing olefinic unsaturation. The reaction is 
performed in the presence of a hydroformylation catalyst 
and results in the formation of a compound, for example, 
an aldehyde, which has one more carbon atom in its 
molecular structure than the starting olefinic feedstock. 
By way of example, higher alcohols may be produced by 
hydroformylation of commercial C5 to C12 olefin fractions 
to a C6 to C13 aldehyde-containing oxonation product, 
which on hydrogenation and distillation yields the 
corresponding alcohol. The crude product of the 
hydroformylation reaction will contain catalyst, 
aldehydes, alcohols, unreacted feedstock, syn gas and by-products. Before further processing of the crude product is  
 
possible, it is necessary to remove the catalyst therefrom. 
One conventional method of removing cobalt values 
(that is, cobalt in any one of its possible oxidation 
states) from such a crude product is to treat the product 
with an alkali or acid wash technique; however, this 
uses expensive raw materials and, moreover, it is 
difficult to remove essentially all traces of cobalt from 
the resulting water wash streams before those may be discharged 
into water courses. Another such conventional 
method involves the oxidation of the cobalt catalytic 
species followed by extraction as a salt in aqueous 
solution. U.S. Patent No. 3725534 describes a method for 
recovery of cobalt values from crude oxo product in 
which the liquid oxo product containing substantially all 
the cobalt values in the form of dissolved cobalt 
compounds is mixed with an aqueous acid, the cobalt 
materials being converted to water-soluble salts of the 
acid. After it has been combined with a promotor, for 
example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt of a weak 
acid, the separated aqueous phase is introduced into a 
preformer containing a preforming catalyst, for example, 
a noble metal catalyst. The effluent is then treated, 
preferably with a strong mineral acid,
