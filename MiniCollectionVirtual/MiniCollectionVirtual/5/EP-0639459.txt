<ABSTRACT>
A continuous multi-jet ink jet printer 
improves print quality in a high speed printer. The 

continuous multi-jet ink jet printer includes means 
for producing a rectangular array of ink drops, the 

array having columns corresponding to the 
consecutive drops in a single jet, and rows 

corresponding to drops simultaneously produced from 
all of the jets, where print drops and partially 

charged drops are printed on a print media and fully 
charged drops are deflected from the print media. 

Print quality is improved by selecting one or more 
print drops for printing and subjecting each of the 

one or more print drops to an equal amount of 
partial charging.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to ink jet 
printers and, more particularly, to improved 
character pattern designs for high speed ink jet 
printers. In a continuous multi-jet ink jet 
printer, ink is supplied under pressure to a 
manifold region that distributes the ink to a 
plurality of orifices, typically arranged in a 
linear array(s). The ink discharges from the 
orifices in filaments which break into droplet 
streams. The row of continuous ink jets that are 
stimulated produce a two-dimensional array of ink 
drops that are directed to a print receiving medium. 
The approach for printing with these droplet streams 
is to selectively charge and deflect certain drops 
from their normal trajectories. In systems in which printing is 
accomplished with uncharged drops, it is important 
that the print drops do not receive a slight charge 
inadvertently. One source of inadvertent charging 
is the drops which have previously formed in the 
stream. Assuming the previous drop in a stream 
carries a charge, the subsequent uncharged drop will 
be formed in sufficient proximity to the charged 
drop that a slight charge of opposite polarity may 
be induced. Such drop-to-drop interference has been 
recognized as a significant problem, and has been 
treated in several patents. In a system in which the jets are 
positioned relatively close together to increase the  
 
system resolution, a charge may be induced in a drop 
by a charging electrode associated with an adjacent 
jet. This problem is known as crosstalk, and 
adversely affects print quality. The effect of an 
unintentional charge so induced upon a charged drop, 
which is to be caught, is merely to alter its 
deflected trajectory slightly. The catching 
arrangement is such that the drop will still be 
caught. However, a print drop which is 
inadvertently charged by an adjacent charge 
electrode will be slightly deflected into a 
trajectory which will significantly affect the 
printing quality of the system. As the print 
distances increases, to about 0.7" from the bottom 
of the catcher, serious print defects exist. The 
defects consist of curved vertical segments and 
spaces between vertical and horizontal segments. In high resolution ink jet printers, two 
types of charging inaccuracies can occur. One type, 
called drop-to-drop crosstalk, results from the 
influence of previously charged drops on subsequent 
drops in a single ink jet. The other type, called 
jet-to-jet crosstalk, results from the influence of 
the charge on neighboring electrodes. These
