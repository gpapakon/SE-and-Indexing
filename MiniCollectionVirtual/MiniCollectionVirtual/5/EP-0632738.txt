<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for 
crystallization in a draft tube baffle crystallizer 
wherein cycling in the particle size distribution of 
the product withdrawn is reduced and the rate of 
production of granular size crystals is increased. Many useful products are produced by 
crystallization from aqueous solution. It is desirable 
to produce large particles for both commercial and 
process benefits. This is particularly true for 
materials which are used in the fertilizer 
applications, such as ammonium sulfate, potassium 
chloride, and potassium sulfate. The trend of modern 
agriculture is to employ bulk blends, i.e., mixtures of 
crystals of individual fertilizers. Granular size 
crystals, i.e., large crystals of greater than 1.7 mm, 
command a premium price because they can be applied 
more uniformly and segregate less from crystals of 
other components of the bulk blends. When the 
crystallizer produces a preponderance of large 
crystals, removal of mother liquor is expedited and the 
drying and screening operations are more efficient. Production of large crystals has been made 
easier with the introduction of the draft tube baffle 
crystallizer (DTB). The design of this crystallizer is 
described in U.S.-A-3,873,275. The problem with 
the DTB crystallizer is the tendency to cycle, that is, 
exhibit a large time dependent variation in the crystal 
size distribution. Although the DTB crystallizers can 
produce a high percentage of their production as 
crystals of size greater than 1.7 mm when at the high 
points of the cycle, considerably less is made at the 
low points. There is also production of considerable  
 
quantities of fine crystals at these low points. These 
wide variations in crystal size distribution are 
undesirable because there is loss of premium priced 
large crystals, introduction of non-uniformity in 
product size caused by segregation in storage piles and 
difficulties in screening. U.S.-A-4,263,010 teaches a dynamic 
control method and apparatus for obtaining a uniform 
particle size. A light scattering particle size 
analyzer is utilized to analyze a preconditioned 
classified sample of the crystal population of the 
crystallizer. A data analyzer then converts the 
signals from the particle analyzer into control signals 
to manipulate various process control variables such as 
fines removal rate, feed rate, pH adjustment, mixing 
rate and/or seed addition. Japanese Patent publication no. 150127
