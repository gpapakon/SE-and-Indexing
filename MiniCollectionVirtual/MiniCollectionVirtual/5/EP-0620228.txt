<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel reactive organic
acid derivative which can be very effectively used in preparation
of 8-lactam antibiotics. Specifically, the present invention
relates to a novel reactive thiophosphate derivative of
thia(dia)zole acetic acid represented by the following general
formula (I):

in which
R1represents hydrogen or an amino-protecting group;R2represents hydrogen, C1-C4 alkyl or -C(Ra)(Rb)CO2Rc, wherein
Ra and Rb in the group -C(Ra)(Rb)CO2Rc for R2 are identical
or different from each other and represent hydrogen or C1-C4
alkyl or Ra and Rb together with a carbon atom to which they
are bound can form a C3-C7 cycloalkyl group and Rc is hydrogen
or a carboxy-protecting group;R3represents C1-C4 alkyl or phenyl or R3 together with an 
oxygen atom and a phosphorus atom to which it is bound can
form a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring; andQrepresents N or CH.The present invention also relates to a process for preparation
of the reactive derivative of formula (I), as defined above.Numerous methods for preparation of 8-lactam antibiotics
have been disclosed in early published references and patent
specifications. However, such prior methods prepare the 8-lactam
antibiotic compound commonly starting from an organic acid having
the following general formula (II) by converting it into its
reactive derivative which is then subjected to the acylation
reaction with an amino group of the 8-lactam nucleus.

In the above formula (II), R1, R2 and Q are defined as previously
described.The reactive derivative of the compound of formula (II)
which has been conventionally used in the above-mentioned prior
methods includes an acid chloride, a reactive ester, a reactive
amide, a mixed acid anhydride and the like. However, such reactive 
derivatives have some disadvantages as mentioned below.
Specifically, the reactive derivative in the form of an acid
chloride or a mixed acid anhydride should be prepared under a
stringent reaction condition and further is unstable so that it
might be used in situ for the acylation reaction without isolation.
This may be the major reascn for the formation of by-products.
Furthermore, when the reactive derivative of the
compound of formula (II) is in the form of a reactive ester and a
reactive amide, it has also disadvantages in that both the yield
and the reactivity of such reactive derivatives are very low and
the acylation reaction requires a long reaction time due to their
low reactivity and, further the reaction by-products, for example,
a hydroxy
