<DESCRIPTION>
 Sulfoπylureas as herbicidesThe present invention relates to novel herbicidally active and plant-growth-regulating N-phenylsulfonyl-N'-pyrimidinyl- and N'-triazinylureas, to processes for their preparation, to compositions containing them as active ingredients, and to the use of these compositions for controlling weeds, especially selectively in crops of useful plants, or for regulating and inhibiting the growth of plants.Urea compounds, triazine compounds and pyrimidine compounds which have herbicidal activity are generally known. Such compounds are described, for example, in European Patent Applications Nos. 0007 687, 0030 138, 0073 562 and 0 126711.Novel sulfonylureas which have herbicidal and plant-growth-regulating properties have now been found.The N-phenylsulfonyl-N'-pyrimidinyl- and N'-triazinylureas according to the invention are those of the formula Iin whichR-! is hydrogen or methyl;R is hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, (W)n-R8; -NO2, -N(R9)R10,— O 1 C-=CRn or -CN;R12 R3, R , R5, R6 and R7 independently of one another are hydrogen or C1-C4alkyl;R8 is C1-C4alkyl, Cι-C4alkyl which is substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4 halogen atoms, CrC3alkoxy or CrC3alkylthio, or is C2-C4alkenyl or C j- alkenyl which is substituted 

by 1, 2, 3 or 4 halogen atoms;R9 is hydrogen, methoxy, ethoxy or Ci- alkyl:R10 is hydrogen or C1-C alkyl;Rn is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl;R12 is hydrogen or methyl;E is -CH=or-N=;X is CrC4alkyl, C C4alkoxy, CrC4haloalkoxy, C C haloalkyl, CrC4haloalkylthio,CrC alkylthio, halogen, C2-C5alkoxyalkyl, C-^-Csalkoxyalkoxy, amino, -Csalk lamino 
Y is CrC4alkyl, CrC4alkoxy, CrC4haloalkoxy, Ci- haloalkylthio, CrC alkylthio,C2-C5alkoxyalkyl, C^-Csalkoxyalkoxy, C^-Csalkylthioalkyl, cyclopropyl or -OCHF2;W is oxygen, sulfur, SO or SO2; and n is the number 0 or 1; and the salts of these compounds; with the proviso that a) at least one of the radicals R3, R4, R5, Rg and R7 is Cx-C alkyl, b) E is -CH= when X is halogen and c) E is -CH= when X or Y are -OCHF2 or -SCHF2.Suitable for X as halogen are: fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, preferably fluorine, chlorine and bromine.Suitable for R3, R4, R5, Rg, R7, R8, R9, R10, X and Y ε. ."1-C alkyl are: methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl or tert-butyl. The alkyl groups preferably have 1-3 carbon atoms.Suitable for R8 as C1-C4alkyl which is substituted by one to four halogen atoms is, in particular, alkyl which is substituted by fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.
