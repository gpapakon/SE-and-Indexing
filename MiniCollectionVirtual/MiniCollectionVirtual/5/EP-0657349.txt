<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for identification
of different states of water on the surface of a
structure, upon which a sensor element has been placed,
the sensor element being made of a material conveying
acoustic oscillation, whereby the sensor element is
connected at its ends to a transmitter-receiver unit.The invention relates also to a sensor arrangement
for identification of different states of water on
the surface of a structure, upon which at least the
sensor element of the sensor arrangement is placed,
whereby the sensor arrangement comprises:
at least one longitudinal sensor element made of a
material conveying acoustic oscillation anda transmitter-receiver unit coupled at the ends of
the sensor element, for transmitting acoustic
oscillation, preferably oscillation effective in the
ultrasonic range, and for receiving the response
of the transmitted oscillation.As to the prior art in the field, reference is made
to the publication GB-1,117,664
which discloses a method according to the preamble of claim 1.
The solution disclosed
in this publication cannot, however, be used for
reliable identification of, particularly, the formation
of ice on the structure upon which the sensor
arrangement is placed, especially under demanding
conditions. In particular, when using this prior art
approach, it is impossible to distinguish between the
different states of water. Further, it is impossible to
locate a change in the state particularly within the
range of placement of the sensor arrangement. It is an aim of the present invention to present a
method for achieving particularly precise identification
of the different states of water from a medium,
e.g. the atmosphere or water, in which the sensor
arrangement is placed, within the measuring range of
the sensor arrangement, detection of a local change
in the state, as well as a continuous possibility for
checking the working order of the sensor arrangement.
For achieving these aims, the method of the invention
is primarily characterized by the features of the second part of claim 1.It is also an aim of the invention to present a sensor
arrangement which is primarily characterized by the features
of the second part of claim 6.The measurement carried out by the method and by the
sensor arrangement is thus based on measuring the
attenuation of the oscillation generated in the sensor
element, the oscillation penetrating different states
of water in the measuring range of the sensor element.
The frequency of the oscillation to be generated is
preferably an
