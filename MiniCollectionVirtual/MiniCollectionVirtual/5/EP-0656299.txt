<ABSTRACT>
The sheet-metal container (1) used as a disposable and as a reusable container for transporting and storing liquid products has a filling nozzle (3), which can be closed by a lid (4), and a further nozzle (5) in the bottom region for the connection of a removal and rinsing tap, an outer grid casing (6) made of metal and a pallet (9) designed as a flat bottom tray (10) of sheet metal with length and width dimensions complying with the European Standard for positive-locking receiving of the sheet-metal container (1) which is fitted with a drainage bottom. The sheet-metal container (1) is welded together from a casing (11), a bottom part (12) and a lid (13). The casing (11), bottom part (12) and lid (13) of the container (1) produced as a dual-wall composite structure consist of a thin inner sheet of special stainless steel and an outer sheet of ordinary steel whose thickness is greater than that of the inner sheet. It is possible to produce the container (1) of plated metal with a thin inner layer of special steel and a thicker outer layer of ordinary steel.

Metal container (1), for transporting and storing liquids,
which is welded together from a jacket (11), a base section (12)

with a discharge base (16) and a withdrawal and flushing opening
for connecting a withdrawal fitting and from a lid (13), made

from sheet metal, and standing on a pallet; the discharge base
(16) of the base section (12) of the container (1) extending

with a gentle gradient from the rear edge (12a) to the front
edge (12b) of the base section (12), on which a connection piece

(5) for connection of the withdrawal and flushing tap is
arranged, and extending with a gradient from both side edges

(12c, 12d) towards the middle of the base and forming a central,
flat discharge channel (17), and the container (1) standing in a

flat base trough (10) which is made of sheet metal and designed
as a pallet (9) and the base trough (10) accommodated to the

discharge base (16) of the container (1) having stiffening beads
(20a, 20b) whose foundations (21) lie in a common horizontal

plane (22-22) and which form, in the base of the trough (10),
downwardly open or closed chambers (23), the flat base trough

(10) having a downwardly drawn outer supporting edge (19), which
forms a hollow supporting collar (24), and the base trough (10)

being secured on a pallet frame (29), made of metal, plastic
material or wood,

characterised in that

the container (1), which is made of plated sheet metal, is
produced with a thin inner layer of corrosion-proof special

steel and a thicker outer layer of normal steel.
Metal container according to the preamble to Claim 1,

characterised in that

the container (1) is produced as a composite construction made
from an inner sheet (14) of special steel and at least one outer

sheet (15) of normal steel.
Metal container according to the preamble to Claim 1

characterised in that
 
the container (1) is manufactured as a composite construction

made from an inner sheet of special steel, an intermediate sheet
of normal steel and an outer sheet of special steel.
Metal container according to one of the Claims 1 to 3,

characterised in that

the container (1) is designed to be self-supporting and in that
the supporting profiles (46) are installed on the container lid

(13) preferably in its corner regions for stacking purposes.
Metal container according to one of the Claims 1 to 4,

characterised by an outer lattice jacket (11) which is made of
metal.
Metal container according to one of the Claims 1 to 5,

characterised by an inner container or a flexible inner shell
which is made of plastic material.
