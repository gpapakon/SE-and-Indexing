<ABSTRACT>
Method for limiting the slippage of the driving wheels (11) of an agricultural tractor (1) equipped with a tool for working the land, consisting in imposing on the tool a corrected position reference datum (Pc) tending to limit slippage, characterised in that the corrected position reference datum (Pc) is formulated by calculating the mean value of slippage GM over a reference period, by determining the discrepancy Eg between the instantaneous slippage GF and the calculated mean value GM, and by comparing the discrepancy Eg with a tolerated wheel slip threshold Sr chosen by the user.

Method for limiting the slipping g of drive wheels (11) of an agricultural
tractor (1) equipped with a ground working tool, by correction of the set

value for the position P established for said tool by the user, characterised in
that the corrected position set value Pc of the tool is determined


by comparison of the value GF of slipping g at the time with an
absolute wheel spinning threshold Sa, as long as the tool has not returned to

its working position, and
by comparison of the deviation Eg between the slipping GF at the
time and the average value GM of slipping g over a reference period, with a

tolerated wheel spinning threshold Sr , when the tool has returned to its
working position.
Method for limiting slipping according to claim 1, characterised in that if Eg

<
 Sr, the corrected position set value Cg is identical to the set value for the
position P established for the lifting arms (2) by the user.
Method for limiting slipping according to claims 1 or 2, characterised in that
if Eg 
>
 Sr, the deviation 
eg = Eg - Sr
 is processed with a corrector (20) such
as to establish a non-zero correction signal Cg, such as 
Pc = P + Cg
.
Method for limiting slipping according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
as long as the tool has not returned to its working position P, the corrected

position set value Pc is equal to the sum of the set value for the position P
and a correction value Cg established by the corrector (20).
Method for limiting slipping according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the slipping at the time GF is determined from

measurements of the turning speed Vm of the drive wheels (11) and of the
speed of movement Vr of the tractor (1) by a calculating unit (8). 
Method for limiting slipping according to claim 5, characterised in that the
calculated slipping value GF is filtered.
Method for limiting slipping according to one of claims 2 to 6, characterised
in that the set value for the position P of the lifting arms is provided by a

control system for force and/or position.
Method for limiting slipping according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised
in that the ground working tool is a tool mounted on the tractor.
Method for limiting slipping according to one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the ground working tool is a semi-mounted tool.
Device for limiting slipping for implementing a method according to one of
the preceding claims, characterised in that it includes a first subtractor (17)

providing comparison of the slipping GF at the time to the absolute wheel
spinning threshold Sa, a second subtractor (25) forming the difference

between the value of slipping GF at the time and the average value GM, and
a third subtractor (26) forming the difference εg between the deviation of

slipping GF - GM and a relative wheel spinning threshold Sr.
Device for limiting slipping according to claim 10, characterised in that it
includes a corrector (20) which establishes the correction signal Cg, by

performing integrated and derived proportional processing on the difference
εg or the deviation GF - Sa.
