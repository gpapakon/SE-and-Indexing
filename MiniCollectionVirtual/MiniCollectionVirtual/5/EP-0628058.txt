A process for the polymerization of C
3
-C
10
-alk-1-enes 
with the aid of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst system, in 

which first a titanium-containing solid component which 
contains a compound of titanium, of magnesium, a halogen 

and an electron donor compound I is reacted with an 
aluminum compound and a further electron donor compound 

II, the reaction mixture is then deactivated by reaction 
with carbon dioxide and the catalyst system thus obtained 

is then used, together with an aluminum compound, for the 
polymerization of C
3
-C
10
-alk-1-enes at from 20 to 150°C 
and from 1 to 100 bar, wherein the addition of further 

amounts of electron donor compound II is dispensed with 
in the polymerization. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a 
prepolymerization with a C
2
-C
10
-alk-1-ene is carried out 
after the reaction of the titanium-containing solid 

component with the aluminum compound and the electron 
donor compound II but before the deactivation of the 

reaction mixture with carbon dioxide. 
A process as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
prepolymerization is carried out with the C
2
-C
10
-alk-1-ene 
until a mass ratio of from 0.1 to 30 parts of polymerized 

C
2
-C
10
-alk-1-ene per part of catalyst has been reached. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the aluminum compound used is a trialkylaluminum compound 

whose alkyl groups are each of 1 to 8 carbon atoms. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 4, wherein a 
phthalic acid derivative of the formula (I)  

 

 
where X and Y are each chlorine or C
1
-C
10
-alkoxy or 
together are oxygen, is used as electron donor compound 

I. 
A process as claimed in claims 1 to 5, wherein an 
organosilicon compound of the formula II 


R
1
 
n
Si(OR
2
)
4-n
 
where the radicals R
1
 are identical or different and are 
each 5-membered to 7-membered cycloalkyl, which in turn 

may carry a C
1
-C
10
-alkyl group, or C
6
-C
20
-aryl or arylalkyl, 
the radicals R
2
 are identical or different and are 
each C
1
-C
20
-alkyl and n is 1, 2 or 3, is used as electron 
donor compound II.
