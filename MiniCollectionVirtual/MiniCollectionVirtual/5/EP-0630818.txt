<ABSTRACT>
In a method for filling bags or sacks, particularly those having side folds, in which the filling connection (2) moves into an opened bag (3) or sack and empties the filling material into this, the filling connection (2) is moved until the lower edge comes to rest on the inside of the bottom of the bag (3) or sack. It presses the bottom against an outer abutment (10). The filling connection (2) open at its mouth is subsequently filled and it then emerges from the bag (3) or sack.

Process for filling bags or sacks, more particularly 
paper bags or paper sacks having side folds, wherein the 

filling pipe is moved into an opened bag or sack and the 
filling material is emptied into same,
 
characterised in that the filling pipe (2) which is provided 

with expanding members (8;9) at the end side is moved until 
its lower edge rests on the inside of the base of the bag 

(3) or sack and then presses the base against an external 
abutment (10), then the filling pipe (2) which is open at 

its mouth is filled and then the filling pipe (2) is removed 
from the bag (3) or sack. 
Apparatus for filling bags or sacks, more particularly 
paper bags or paper sacks having side folds, with a filling 

pipe (2) which is mounted to move into an opened bag or 
sack, according to claim 1
 
characterised in that the filling pipe has expanding members 

(8) arranged at the end side and capable of swivelling about 
horizontal swivel axes (8a) arranged parallel to each other, 

and that the filling pipe can be moved against an external 
abutment (10) until its lower edge rests on the inside of 

the base of the bag or sack. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in that 
the swivel axes (8a) of the expanding members (8) extend 

parallel to the narrow side of the filling pipe (2) which 
has a rectangular cross-section. 
Apparatus according to claims 2 and 3 characterised in 
that the filling pipe (2) has in the area of its mouth a 

cross-section which is reduced compared with the remaining 
area wherein the expanding members (8) are fixed in the area 

of the reduced cross-section.  
 
Apparatus according to one or more of claims 2 to 4 

characterised in that a shaping chamber (7) is provided 
surrounding the filling pipe (2) and bag (3) wherein the 

base of the shaping chamber forms the abutment (10) for the 
base of the bag and the edge of the filling pipe (2) wherein 

the shaping chamber has on two long sides longitudinal side 
walls extending perpendicular to the base, and is designed 

open at the two end sides.
