<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a metering system for devices for coating running webs of material, especially paper or board, with coating compound. The invention is characterised by the following features:   (a) the mounting for a doctor bed or a coating blade is in each case the same; (b) the pressing of the roll doctor (2) carried by the doctor bed against a counter roll (W) or against the material web guided by this is carried out by means of a pressure hose; (c) the pressing of the coating blade is carried out by means of a pointed part (15, 25, 45, 55) of a profile rail (14, 24, 44, 54) extending transversely to the counter roll (W) or material web, which rail is adjustable transversely to the material web or counter roll (W) in sections, to which respectively dedicated adjusting devices (31, 32, 33) are allocated and (d) the engagement lines of the nip forces for the doctor bed on the one hand and the coating blade on the other hand are mutually offset in the direction transverse to the counter roll (W) or material web.

Apportioning device for coating continuous lengths of material, 
in particular paper or cardboard, with a coating substance, with 

the following features: 

(a) the holder (18,18'; 28,28'; 48,48'; 58,58') for a knife bed 
(11, 21, 41, 51) or a spreading blade (4, 5) is always the 

same; 
(b) the roller knife (2), which is carried by the knife bed, is 
pressed by a pressure hose (13, 23, 43, 53) against a 

counter-roller (W) or a length of material which is guided 
by it; 
(c) the spreading blade is pressed on at least substantially by 
a tip portion (15, 25, 45, 55) of a profile ledge (14, 24, 44, 

54), which extends transversely to the counter-roller (W) or 
length of material and which is sectionally adjustable 

transversely to the length of material or counter-roller (W) 
which are associated with their own adjusting devices (31, 

32, 33), 
 
   
characterised
 by the following features: 

(d) the profile ledge (14, 24, 44, 54) is provided exclusively for 
pressing on the spreading blade; and 
(e) the profile ledge (14, 24, 44, 54) is offset relative to the 
pressure hose (13, 23, 43, 53) which serves to press on 

the knife bed in such a manner that the planes through the 
engagement lines of the press-on loads for the knife bed 

on the one hand and the spreading blade on the other 
hand are offset relative to each other in the direction 

transversely to the counter-roller (W) or the length of 
material or extend at an acute angle to each other. 
Device according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
pressure hose (13, 23, 43, 53) is held in the profile ledge (14, 

24, 54) or in a continuation of its holder (14', 24', 64) which is at 
a distance of at least 5 mm from the press-on edge to be  

 
applied to the spreading blade, as seen in the direction of the 

guide elements (19, 29, 59) of the apportioning device for the 
profile ledge (14, 24, 54). 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 a 
holding plate (26, 46), which is integrated with the knife bed (22, 

42), is provided which is, relative to the back of the knife bed 
facing away from the counter-roller or the length of material if 

present or given in the area of the roller knife bar (2) or as of the 
pressure-load line of the profile ledge in the direction of the 

holding plate (26, 46), offset from the knife bed (22, 42) by at 
least its wall thickness in order to exclude contact of the tip 

portion (25, 45) of the profile ledge (24, 44) with the knife bed. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 3, 
characterised in that
 
the effective line of the press-on load of the pressure hose (13, 

23) is arranged transversely to the pressure-load line of the 
profile ledge including its tip portion (15, 25) and through the 

centre line of the roller knife (2) and preferably at an angle 
between 80 and 95° relative to its tangential plane extending 

through the abutment line of the roller knife (2) on the counter-roller 
(W). 
Device according to Claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the 
extension (14', 24'), which carries the pressure hose (13, 23), of 

the profile ledge (14, 24) is arranged at a greater distance from 
the clamping of knife bed or spreading blade than the tip portion 

(15) of the profile ledge (14) in case a leaf spring (16) serves to 
hold the knife bed (11), and at a shorter distance from the 

clamping than the tip portion (25) of the profile ledge (24) in 
case a holding plate (26) is provided which is integrated with the 

knife bed (22). 
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 3, 
characterised in that
 
the pressure hose (43) for the knife bed (42) is held therein. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 6, 
characterised in that
 
the holder (18,18'; 28,28'; 48,48') which comprises the clamping 

for the spreading blade (4) or the holder for the knife bed (16,  
 

26, 46), is arranged in such a manner that the angle between 
holding part (16, 26, 46) of the knife bed or the spreading blade 

(4) in its unclamped, unbent state and the tangential plane

counter-roller (W) or length of material in the provided pivotal 
position of the apportioning device for operation with the roller 

blade is between 25 and 35°. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 7, 
characterised in that

Device according to Claim 9, 
characterised in that
 the pivotal 
radius is at least 500 mm. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 - 10, 
characterised in that

generated solely by the profile ledge (14, 24, 54). 
Device, in particular according to one of Claims 1 - 10, 

characterised in that
 for so-called bent-blade operation a 
considerable portion of press-on pressure of the spreading
