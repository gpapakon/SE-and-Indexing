<ABSTRACT>
A surgical head clamp (10) having two arms, one (14) with a single 
head 

engaging pin (20) and the second (13) with two head engaging pins (40) 
mounted on 

a bracket (24). The bracket is capable of being rotated to reposition 
the head. The operating knob (32) which releases the bracket to allow 

rotation has a safety locking pin (50) which prevents the inadvertent 
rotation of the bracket when the pin is in a locked position. 

Furthermore there are channels (55) at the base of the dished sockets 
(43) in actuator disk (31) to provide a passageway for fluid to be 

removed during the vacuum cycle of a sterilization process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a skull clamp or surgical
head clamp to hold the head of the patient in position for
neurosurgical operations and for other procedures
involving the patient's head.Surgical head clamps or skull clamps generally are
provided with two types of mechanisms to hold the head in
position. One type of clamp uses pads that are forced
against the patient's head to hold the head in position.
Examples of head clamps of this type are disclosed in U.S.
Patents 4,108,426 and 4,545,572.A second type of head clamp uses a series of head engaging
pins which engage the patient's skull at three points and
provide positive anchorage of the head engaging pins into
the skull. If the head engaging pins are held in a stable
position, there is little likelihood that the skull will
move relative to the head engaging pins during the
surgical procedure.The head clamp disclosed in U.S. Patent 2,966,383 shows a
three pin arrangement with the head engaging pins carried
on hinged arms.U.S. Patent 3,099,441 discloses a surgical head clamp
which contains two head engaging pins on a bracket
supported by an arm and a third head engaging pin
supported by another arm in the device. The two arms are
brought together to adjust the space between the head
engaging pins to fit the dimensions of the patient's head. U.S. Patent 3,835,861 discloses a surgical head clamp
having three head engaging pins with two of the pins on a
bracket and a third pin on a moveable pin carrier in which
the moveable pin is held on a threaded pin carrier so
finer adjustments in the relationship of the head engaging
pins to the patient can be made.U.S. Patent 4,169,478 also discloses a surgical head clamp
with three head engaging pins which is similar to that
shown in U.S. Patent 3,835,861. The head clamp includes
a mechanism to rotate the bracket containing the two pins
and reposition the head of the patient without releasing
the head engaging pins from the patient's skull. The
mechanism disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,169,478 to prevent
rotation employs interlocking teeth on stop members which
are forced into engagement by ball actuators. The ball
actuators move from dished sockets in the unlocked
position to the lands between the dished sockets in the
locket position. Upon repeated use and upon repeated
sterilization, there is a tendency for foreign particles
and debris to accumulate in the dished sockets or on the
lands which prevent the positive locking of the bracket.Although the surgical head clamp disclosed in U.S. Patent

<CLAIMS>
A surgical head clamp (10) including:

a frame;
a first head engaging pin (20) supported on the frame;
a bracket (24) rotatably supported on the frame with
the axis of rotation aligned with the first head engaging

pin (20) and the bracket (24) spaced from the first head
engaging pin (20);
second and third head engaging pins (40) mounted on
the bracket (24);
means (15, 16) for advancing the first head engaging
pin (20) axially toward the bracket (24) to cause the head

engaging pins (20, 40) to engage a patient's head;
the bracket being affixed to a locking mechanism (22), said
mechanism comprising:
a first ring gear (25) fixed on the bracket (24) having
teeth (26) on its surface, a second ring gear (28)

moveable towards said fixed ring gear (25) and having teeth (27) on a first surface
facing the surface of the fixed ring gear and adapted to engage

the teeth (26) on the fixed ring gear (25) to lock the bracket;
a second surface of the moveable ring gear (28)
opposite to its first surface having dished sockets (29);
ball actuators (30) positioned between said second surface of the moveable ring gear
and the opposing surface of an actuator disk (31),

said opposing surface having dished sockets (43); the dished
sockets (29, 43) being provided for the reception of the ball actuators;
and an operating handle (32) fixed to the

actuator disk (31), rotatable between a locked and an unlocked d position;
said ball actuators (30) capable of moving the
moveable ring gear (28) into engagement with the fixed ring

gear (25) upon rotation of the operating handle (32)
from said unlocked to said locked position;

   characterised in that the surgical head clamp
comprises a safety locking pin (50) mounted on the operating

handle (32), an opening (47) in the frame adjacent to the
operating handle (32) to receive the safety locking pin

(50) when said handle is in said locked position,
and thereby prevent rotation of the operating handle

(32) when the pin (50) is in said opening (47).
The surgical head clamp (10) of claim 1 in which the
safety locking pin (50) is attached to a locking slide (52)

which is slideably mounted in a slot (60) on the periphery 
of the operating handle (32), and has a length dimension

which is at least equal to the thickness of the operating
handle (32).
The surgical head clamp (10) of claim 2 in which the
slot (60) in the operating handle is a dovetail shape.
The head clamp (10) of claim 1 in which there is an
opening (55) in the base of each of the dished sockets (43)

in the actuator disk (31) to provide a passageway for fluid
to be removed from said dished sockets (43).
