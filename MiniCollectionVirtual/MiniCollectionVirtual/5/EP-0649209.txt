<ABSTRACT>
A synchronization controller identifies the timing of the 
group assigned to the receiver based on a synchronization signal 

detected by a preamble and synchronization signal detector. At 
this timing the power supply of a radio section is turned on. 

A selective calling number within the received group and pre-assigned 
selective calling number are compared in a selective 

calling number detector. The power supply of the radio section 
is immediately turned off, if the result of the comparison is 

non-coincidence. In this way, the battery saving efficiency can 
be enhanced by arranging to turn on the radio section only in the 

groups which are assigned to the receiver, and turning off 
immediately the power supply of the radio section when the 

receivers assigned selective calling number is not found in the 
receiver's assigned group.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power supply control and,
more particularly, to a power supply control for a selective
calling receiver having a battery saving function.In a prior art selective calling receiver, a controller
supplies a battery current to a receiving portion therein only
when the receiver receives a synchronizing signal and a frame
assigned to its own receiver to reduce consumption of the
battery. Namely, the receiving portion is turned on only at each
timing of the synchronizing signal and the assigned frame and is
turned off at other times.However, since several receivers are assigned to one frame,
the frame may not include a message for the receiver if the
receiver turns the receiving portion on at a timing of the
assigned frame. Therefore, an improved receiver is disclosed in,
for example,
JP-A-04-115632. This receiver detects whether a
message addressed to its own receiver is included or not and
turns the receiving portion off immediately after determining
that the addressed message is not included in the frame.While such a receiver can reduce consumed current, since the
receiver turns the receiving portion on at a timing of 
each synchronizing signal, the receiver still consumes too much
current and therefore the battery life is unnecessarily
shortened.US-A-4 839 639 discloses a paging receiver with a battery saving
circuit powering the radio section and the waveform shaping section
only during intervalls which include address codewords specific
to the given receiver group. Power is not supplied during intervals
containing synchronization code signals other than during the
first such interval directly following the preamble code.It is therefore an object of the present invention to
provide a miniaturized selective calling receiver which enhances the battery
saving efficiency by improving the receiving operation for the
synchronizing signals and the frames which are assigned to the
receiver which is capable of reducing the required capacity of the battery
and of using a small size battery. This object is solved with the features of the claims.The selective calling receiver as described has a battery saving
function which carries out reception in the groups or frames
assigned to the receiver itself out of received signals
consisting of a plurality of block error correction code
sequences, and is equipped with first detecting
means for detecting a first synchronizing signal followed a
preamble signal from a received signal and first control means
for generating a first timing
