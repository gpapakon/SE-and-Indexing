<ABSTRACT>
A luminaire arrangement is described which is intended in particular also for low ambient temperatures, and a fluorescent lamp (1) as well as a double-tube system (2) which surrounds this fluorescent lamp, the double-tube system comprising an inner tube (3) and an outer tube (4), mounted and held at a distance with respect to the inner tube via a sealing arrangement (5, 6), and there being provided in the region of this sealing arrangement an annular coupling space into which there engages a cylinder section (9) of adaptors (8) which support the arrangement.

Lamp assembly, in particular for refrigerated chambers, 
comprising a fluorescent lamp (1) having a 

socket at an end face, and also a double-tube system 
too, consisting of light permeable material, supported 

via carrier units (8), in particular at the end regions 
of the fluorescent lamp (1), with the double-tube 

system being spaced relative to the fluorescent 
lamp (1) and preferably being positioned coaxial to 

the fluorescent lamp (1), characterised in that the 

double-tube system (2) comprises an inner tube (3) and 
an outer tube (4) which is supported at both ends on 

this inner tube (3) via an elastic, ring-like sealing 
element (5); in that the ring-like sealing elements 

(5) are disposed spaced from the ends of the double-tube 
system (2) and are provided with a cylindrical 

formation (6) which respectively extends up to the region 
of the end of the double tube, with the wall 

thickness of the cylindrical formation being substantially 
smaller than the radial extent of the closed 

ring space (7) formed by the double-tube system (2) 
and the sealing elements (5); and in that in each case 

a coupling space is bounded between the ring-like seal 
element, its cylindrical formation (6) and the tube 

wall disposed opposite to the same, with a cylindrical 
portion (9) of the respective carrier unit (8) engaging 

into this coupling space. 
Lamp assembly in accordance with claim 1, characterised 
in that a ring element (10) which is preferably 

braced against an abutment of the carrier unit (8) is 
moulded onto the end of the cylindrical formation (6) 

remote from the ring-like sealing element (5) and 
formed in one piece with the sealing element (5), with  

 
the ring element (10) in particular extending radially 

inwardly and forming an abutment member for the end 
face of the inner tube (3). 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that a metal sleeve (17) is 

arranged in the end regions of the double-tube system 
(2) between the outer tube (4) and the cylindrical 

portion (9) of the respective carrier unit (8) carrying 
the double-tube system (2), with the metal sleeve 

extending axially beyond the ring-like seal element 
(5). 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the carrier unit (8) is 

of sleeve-like design and is supported on the fluorescent 
lamp (1) by a plurality of clamping springs (12) 

which are arranged and distributed around the periphery, 
with the clamping springs (12) preferably each 

being held in a recess (11) of the carrier unit (8) 
which is open at one end face. 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that each carrier unit (8) 

has a radially extending ring wall (14) with a radially 
outwardly disposed tube mount (15) into which the 

ends of a reflector tube (13) engage. 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that each carrier unit (8) 

has a cylindrical support part (16) at the side adjacent 
the cap of the respective fluorescent lamp (1), 

with the cylindrical support part having an adapter 
function.  

 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the inner tube (3) consists 

of a glass or plastic tube and the outer tube 
(4) consists of a plastic tube. 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the ring-like sealing 

element (5) and the associated cylindrical formation 
(5) consist of a silicone rubber. 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the ring-like seal element 

(5) and the associated cylindrical formation (6) 
are adhesively bonded to the inner tube (3) and in 

that the reflector tube (13) is provided on a partial 
peripheral region with a high gloss mirror finish (18) 

and is preferably secured, in particular adhesively 
bonded, in a dust-tight and spraywater-tight manner in 

the tube mount (15). 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the prestress of the 

clamping springs (12) is selected in such a way that 
during the lamp installation and lamp exchange these 

clamping springs (12) form an effective security 
against sliding with respect to the fluorescent tube 

(1). 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one or more of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the carrier 

unit (8) formed as an adapter can be used as a multipurpose 
member and, in conjunction with a fluorescent 

lamp (1), can be coupled to a protective tube (4) with 
or without a metal sleeve (17) for a temperature range  

 
down to about -20°C and can be coupled to an additional 

reflector tube (13) to provide a closed system 
which can be used down to about -50°C. 
Lamp assembly in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the ring-like sealing 

element (5) is provided with a valve region which becomes 
effective on the occurrence of a predeterminable 

inner pressure in the closed ring space (7), with the 
valve region in particular being realised by a peripheral 

region of the ring-like seal element (5) which 
contacts the outer tube or the optionally present 

metal sleeve (17) with a radial pressure which is 
lower in comparison to the remaining peripheral region.
