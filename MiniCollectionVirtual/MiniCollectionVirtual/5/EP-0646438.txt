<ABSTRACT>
A worktable (1) for machine-tools comprises a plurality of vacuum suckers (3) for holding the workpieces to be machined, the vacuum suckers (3) having lifting rods (6) which bear, at their head, suction cups (4), are guided height-adjustably via adjusting drives (5) and can be fixed at any desired height by means of clamping devices (14). In order to achieve, in a simple and low-cost manner, perfect and careful supporting and clamping of any desired workpieces, at least a large part of the clamping devices (14) is supported so as to be displaceable by a predetermined displacement travel (H) in the adjusting direction of the lifting rods (6) and can be moved to and fro between the end points of the displacement travel (H) via an adjusting device (5, 18).

<CLAIMS>
A work table (1) for machine tools, comprising a 
number of negative-pressure suckers (3) for holding the 

workpieces for machining, the suckers (3) having jacks 
(8) bearing suction cups (4) at the head end and guided 

for vertical adjustment by adjusting drives (5) and 
adapted to be secured in any vertical position by 

clamping means (14), characterised in that a part (16) 
of each clamping means (14) connectable to the jack (6) 

is supported so as to be movable by a given travel 
distance (H) in the direction of adjustment of the 

jacks (6) and is movable in reciprocation between the 
end points of the travel (H) by an adjusting device (5, 

18). 
A work table according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the device for adjusting each clamping means 

(14) comprises a return spring (18) and the drive (5) 
for adjusting the associated jack (6). 
A work table according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that at least the negative-pressure 

suckers (3) equipped with movable clamping means (14) 
have individually actuated shut-off means (19) for 

connection to a negative-pressure source. 
A work table according to claim 3, characterised 
in that the shut-off means (19) are each actuated in 

dependence on the travel of the associated clamping 
means (14).  

 
A work table according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the slidable parts of the clamping means engage 

an actuating part (23) of the shut-off means (19) via 
linkages (25). 
A work table according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the slidable parts of the clamping means cooperate 

with switches for actuating the shut-off means 
(19). 
A method of holding a workpiece on a work table 
according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein the suckers 

(3) disposed in the region (2) where the workpiece is 
supported are moved upwards from a lower inoperative 

position to an upper set position adapted to the 
workpiece surface and are negatively pressurised, 

characterised in that firstly some of the suckers (3), 
preferably three suckers, serving as supports for the 

workpiece are raised into their set position and 
optionally secured and the other suckers (3) provided 

for holding the workpiece are moved up to a standby 
position lower than their set position by an amount 

equal to the distance (H) travelled by the clamping 

means (14) and are firmly clamped in the standby 
position by the clamping means (14) at the lower end 

points of the travel, or in that initially all the 
suckers (3) provided for holding the workpiece are 

moved up to a standby position lower than their set 
position by a distance (H) equal to the distance (H) 

travelled by the clamping means and are firmly clamped 
therein by the clamping means (14) at the lower end 

points of the travel, after which some suckers (3), 
preferably three suckers, constituting a workpiece  

 
support are moved out of the standby position into 

their set position by the clamping means (4) being 
moved up to the upper end points of the travel, 

whereupon the workpiece is placed on the suckers (3) 
constituting the support, after which the remaining 

suckers (3) are brought from the standby position to 
their set position by the clamping means (14) being 

moved up to the upper end points of the travel. 
A method according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the suckers (3) are moved up to the standby 

position or are brought from the standby position to 
the set position in groups.
