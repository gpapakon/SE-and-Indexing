<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
silicone emulsions and more specifically to a silicone
emulsion composition that is useful as a mold release
coating in aluminum die casting.Silicone emulsion compositions prepared by
dispersing organopolysiloxane uniformly in water with
the aid of an emulsifier are widely used as fiber
processing agents, mold releasing agents, paint
additives, and cosmetic feed materials. Examples of
this type of silicone emulsion composition include a
silicone emulsion composition made from an aqueous
emulsion of dimethylpolysiloxane and polyoxyethylene
alkyl phenyl ether sulfuric acid sodium (see Japanese
Kokoku Patent No. Sho 53[1978]-13501) and emulsions
made from cyclic methylpolysiloxane, emulsifier, and
water (see, for instance, Japanese Kokai Patent
Application No. Sho 56[1981]-95952.)Conventional silicone emulsion compositions
such as those described above suffer from the drawback
that they have a poor mechanical stability. That is to
say that under mechanical shear, the emulsion form is
easily damaged. For example, when these silicone
emulsion compositions are used as a mold release in an
aluminum die-casting operation, the silicone emulsion
composition is generally diluted several tens of times
with water. The diluted solution is fed from a
reservoir by a gear pump and sprayed onto the surface
of a mold. The water in the emulsion is evaporated
therefrom to form a uniform oil film of
organopolysiloxane on the surface of the mold. Excess
amounts of the diluted solution are recovered for
recycling, being fed back by a gear pump. In this
repeated liquid feed method, emulsion damage takes 
place, and it is thereafter impossible to uniformly
coat the mold.The oil film produced by the aforementioned
conventional silicone emulsion compositions has an
additional drawback in that has a poor paintability.
Consequently, when these silicone emulsion compositions
are used as a mold releasing agent, the oil film
adheres to the surface of the die-cast part and makes
painting or marking the part very difficult.Finally, the oil film produced by the prior
art silicone emulsion compositions has a low strength
and hence, it has poor lubricity under extreme-pressure.
Consequently, when these silicone emulsion
compositions are used as a mold releasing agent in
aluminum die-cast molding, cracks often form in the oil
film produced therefrom. Such cracks cause the
aluminum melt to misrun, which produces surface defects
in the die cast part.In accordance with the present invention
there is
