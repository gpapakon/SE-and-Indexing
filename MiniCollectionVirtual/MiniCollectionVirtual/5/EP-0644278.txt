<ABSTRACT>
A powdery α-alumina comprising single-crystal α-alumina grains which are homogeneous and free from any crystal seed 
inside, form an at least eight-sided polyhedron, and have a D to H ratio of 0.5 to 3.0 (wherein D is the maximum grain diameter 

in parallel with the hexagonal lattice plane of the α-alumina having a hexagonal closest lattice structure and H is the grain diameter 
perpendicular to the hexagonal lattice plane thereof), a number-average grain diameter of longer than 5 µm up to 30 µm, a 

sodium content of less than 0.05 wt.% in terms of Na₂O and an alumina purity of 99.90 wt.% or above. The powdery α-alumina 
of the invention comprises single-crystal α-alumina grains which are highly pure, fine and homogeneous, have a narrow grain 

size distribution, are not aggregated, and form an at least eight-sided polyhedron. It is suitable as the raw materials of abrasive, 
sinter, plasma spraying material, filler, single crystal, catalyst support, phosphor, sealing material and ceramic filter, thus being 

remarkably useful from the industrial viewpoint. In particular, it has such a high purity that it can be used as the raw material of 
single crystals of, for example, yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG), sapphire and ruby, which cannot be prepared from low-purity 

α-alumina, and as the raw material of high-purity sinter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to α-alumina. α-Alumina
powder has been widely used as an abrasive, a raw material
for sintered products, a plasma spraying material, a filler
and the like. The α-alumina of this invention comprises
α-alumina single crystal particles which are not agglomerated
particles and have high purity, structural homogeneity, and a
narrow particle size distribution, and is of high industrial
use as an abrasive, a raw material for sintered products, a
plasma spraying material, a filler, a raw material for single
crystals, a raw material for a carrier for catalysts, a raw
material for fluorescent substances, a raw material for
encapsulations, a raw material for ceramic filters, etc. The
α-alumina of the present invention has extremely high purity
and is particularly useful as a starting material for single
crystals of yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG), sapphire, ruby,
etc. and a raw material for high purity sintered products to
which low purity α-alumina cannot be applied.α-Alumina powder is widely used as an abrasive, a raw
material of sintered products, a plasma spraying material, a
filler, etc. α-Alumina powder obtained by conventional 
processes comprises irregular-shaped polycrystals, contains
many agglomerates, and has a broad particle size
distribution. For some uses, the purity of these
conventional species is insufficient. In order to eliminate
these problems, α-alumina powder produced by special
processes as hereinafter described has been employed for
specific uses. However, these special processes still fail
to arbitrarily control the shape or particle diameter of
α-alumina. It has thus been difficult to obtain α-alumina
powder having a narrow particle size distribution.Known special processes for producing α-alumina
powder include a process utilizing a hydrothermal reaction of
aluminum hydroxide (hereinafter referred to as hydrothermal
treatment process); a process comprising adding a flux to
aluminum oxide, fusing, and precipitating (hereinafter
referred to as flux process); and a process in which aluminum
hydroxide is calcined in the presence of a mineralizer.With respect to a hydrothermal process, JP-B-57-22886
(the term "JP-B" as used herein means an "examined published
Japanese patent application") discloses a process in which
corundum is added as a seed crystal to control the particle
size. The process consists of synthesis in a high
temperature under a high pressure, making the resulting
α-alumina powder expensive.According to the study by Matsui, et al.
