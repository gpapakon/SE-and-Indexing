<ABSTRACT>
A card edge connector includes inner housings that 
accommodate electrically conducting terminals. The inner 

housings are rotatably supported within a box-like outer 
housing. A rotatable range is regulated by projected 

portions of the respective housings being abutted against 
each other, so that an opening of the outer housing is 

kept open to allow an end portion of a printed board to be 
inserted. In addition, the terminals do not come in 

contact with each other, so that the circuit is kept from 
being shorted. When the insertion of the end portion into 

the outer housing is started, the upper inner housing 
rides over the end portion slightly. However, as the end 

portion is further inserted to the depth of the outer 
housing, introducing cams formed on a hood enclosing the 

end portion cause the upper inner housing to rotate with a 
slight insertion force, thereby causing the terminals to 

be urged into full engagement with the end portion of the 
printed board.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a card edge connector for 
electrically connecting tongue portions of a plurality of 
terminals to a connecting section having a plurality of 
stripped terminals formed on an edge portion on both 
surfaces of a printed board. The invention also relates 
to a method for connecting opposed terminals to a printed 
board. A card edge connector is designed to connect an 
edge portion of a printed board between opposed terminals. 
A connecting section of the printed board has a plurality 
of terminals juxtaposed on both surfaces of the edge 
portion of the printed board. The terminals are formed by 
stripping parts of printed wire paths on the edge portion. 
A conventional card edge connector of this type is shown 
in Figures 6 and 7. In Figures 6 and 7, terminals (not shown) are 
formed on both surfaces of an end portion of a printed 
board. A slit-like insertion opening 4, which allows the 
end portion 1 of the card to be inserted therein, is 
formed in a box-like housing 3 of a card edge connector 2. 
The housing 3 holds terminals 5, 5 formed on opposite 
sides of a slender space 7 that communicates the insertion 
opening 4 within the depth of the housing 3. The 
respective terminal fittings 5, 5 have flexible tongue-like 
abutment portions 6 that project toward each other in 
the slender space 7. With this construction, to connect the card edge 
connector 2 to the end portion 1 of the printed board, the 
end portion 1 is aligned with the insertion opening 4 of 
the housing 3 and inserted or slid into the insertion 
opening 4 to an inserted position shown in Figure 7. 
During insertion, the end portion 1 pushingly expands the 
opposed vertically projecting tongue-like abutment 
portions 6 away from each other as the end portion moves 
toward the space 7 along a longitudinal axis of the 
insertion opening 4.  
 In the aforementioned conventional card edge 
connector, the end portion 1 abuts against the abutment 
portions 6 obliquely to cause the abutment portions 6 to 
flex while sliding along the abutment portions 6 during 
insertion of the end portion 1. Accordingly, the end 
portion 1 is subjected to frictional and spring resistance 
at the time the end portion 1 pushingly expands the 
abutment portions 6. In some cases, the frictional 
resistance is of such a magnitude that the end portion 1 
cannot slide well, thus deforming the abutment portions 6. 
In addition, the large frictional and spring resistance 
adversely affects the connecting operation.

<CLAIMS>
A card edge connector (10) for holding the plurality of 
terminals (41), and for connecting the terminals to upper 

and lower surfaces of a card edge, the edge connector 
comprising: 


upper and lower inner housings (30) for holding the 
terminals in opposed relation corresponding to the upper 

and lower surfaces of the card edge; 
an outer housing (20) adapted to mount the inner housings, 
said outer housing having a card edge insertion 

opening (21) sized for insertion of the card edge, and 
an outer housing opening sized for insertion of the inner 

housing, said outer housing opening being located 
on a side formed on the outer housing that is opposite 

to a side on which the card edge insertion opening is 
formed; 
 
characterized in that 


said inner housings are rotatably supported in the 
outer housing and 
guide means (26, 32) are provided to regulate the 

rotatable range of the inner housings. 
The card edge connector according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said guide means (26, 32) include 

projected portions (26) formed on inner walls of the 
outer housing (20) that engage the inner housings (30). 
The card edge connector according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said guide means (26, 32) include  

 
projected portions (32) formed on outer walls of the 

inner housings (30) that engage the outer housing (20). 
A method of sandwiching a printed board between a plurality 
of opposed terminals using a card edge connector 

of claim 1, said method comprising: 

providing an outer housing (20) with an insertion opening 
(21) adapted to said printed board; 
disposing a pair of terminal housing members (30) 
within said outer housing, each of said terminal housing 

members being mounted on said outer housing on opposite 
sides of said insertion opening; 
inserting said printed board into said insertion opening 
while maintaining a space between said terminal 

housing members during initial insertion of the printed 
board; and 
moving the terminal housing members toward the insertion 
opening, thereby closing said space, when the 

printed board approaches a completely inserted position, 
thereby firmly sandwiching the printed board between 

the terminal housing members. 
The method of claim 4, further comprising providing 
guides (55) adjacent to said printed board, wherein 

said moving step includes rotating the terminal housing 
members (30) toward said insertion opening with said 

guides when the printed board approaches said 
completely inserted position. 
The method of claim 4, further comprising restricting 
movement of said terminal housing members (30) during 

said initial insertion.
