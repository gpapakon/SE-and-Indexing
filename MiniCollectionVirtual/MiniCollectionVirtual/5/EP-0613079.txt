<ABSTRACT>
The system comprises interface means (7) with a 
surface (15) on which pre-determined coded areas (ON, 

OFF; 1-4) are defined to represent respective control 
means associated with the operational members (P, EV1, 

EV2) of the machine. The surface (15) is continuously 
monitored by a television camera (8) which uses the video 

signals, corresponding to the image of the surface (15) 
it picks up, to drive an image processor (11) which in 

turn selectively drives said operational members (P, EV1, 
EV2) of the machine with a corresponding command signal 

when at least a respective coded area (ON, OFF; 1-4) is 
obscured with respect to the field of view (9) of the 

television camera (8) for at least a certain period of 
time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a man-machine interface 
system, wherein the term "machine" as used here is meant 
in its broadest sense and may therefore include any 
device whatsoever, regardless of its complexity, which is 
adapted to be controlled or set by an user in view of 
automatically starting and performing pre-determined 
operational duties. In particular, but not exlusively or 
solely, the man-machine interface system according to the 
present invention may be advantageously applied to 
industrial-type plants and equipment. It is widely known that each machine is substantially 
provided with some interface arrangement through which a 
user is able to set and/or control the operation of the 
same machine. Such interface arrangements are usually 
adapted to receive a command of a mechanical type (such 
as for instance the pressure exerted by a finger on one 
or several push-buttons) from a user and convert it into 
an electrical signal which the machine is able to 
recognize in order to start and/or perform a pre-determined 
operational duty. In a most simple case, such  
 
an interface arrangement may consist of an electric 
ON/OFF switch device, whereas in a more complex case it 
may comprise at least a panel provided with control and 
regulation buttons and/or knobs (a good case in point may 
be here a photocopying machine or a machine tool for 
industrial plants). At any rate, a man-machine interface will usually 
comprise electro-mechanical transducers, ie. elements 
that require the interface to be physically associated 
with respective electrical connections. As it may easily 
be appreciated, this involves the need of associating the 
interface with respective wire harnesses, which make the 
interface quite difficult to assemble, create a number of 
problems in terms of safety and electrical insulation, 
and may also prove to be an encumbrance in certain 
applications where they would take up a lot of space. 
Furthermore, in a number of cases the interface itself, 
with its transducer means, may prove bulkier than 
actually desirable, in particular as far as its depth 
dimension is concerned. It therefore is a purpose of the present invention to 
provide a man-machine interface system that enables the 
various drawbacks associated with the prior art to be 
substantially eliminated. More particularly, it is a purpose of the present 
invention to provide a man-machine interface system that 
does not require any actual electrical connection to 
directly connect said interface with the machine,

<CLAIMS>
Man-machine interface system comprising interface 
means that are operable to impart control commands to at 

least an operational member of the machine, characterized 
in that said interface means (7) comprise a surface (15) 

on which pre-determined coded areas (ON, OFF; 1-4) are 
defined to represent respective controls associated with 

said operational member (P, EV1, EV2) of the machine, 
said surface (15) being adapted to be monitored in a 

substantially continuous manner by at least a television 
camera (8) which is arranged to drive, with video signals 

corresponding to the image it picks up of said surface 
(15), image processor means (11) which in turn are 

adapted to control said operational member (P, EV1, EV2) 
through a corresponding command when at least a 

respective coded area (ON, OFF; 1-4) is substantially 
obscured with respect to the field of view (9) of said 

television camera (8). 
Man-machine interface system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said image processor means (11) are 

capable of controlling said operational member (P, EV1, 
EV2) through said corresponding control when at least a 

respective coded area (ON, OFF, 1-4) is obscured during 

at least a pre-determined minimum period of time. 
Man-machine interface system according to claim 1, 
characterized in that said surface (15) of the interface 

means (7) is substantially flat and bidimensional.
