<ABSTRACT>
The bridge according 
to the present invention is designed with a smaller dead 

load under normal conditions, and applied with a temporary 
dead load as an additional mass to improve the static 

characteristics and aerodynamic stability when the bridge 
is subjected to particularly violent storms that result in 

significant vibrations and swaying of the bridge. The 
present invention bridge structure is highly economical. A 

passage (6) is provided in the stiffening girder (4) at the center 
of its width along the direction of the bridge axis, so 

that a temporary dead load as an additional mass can be 
moved into the passage (6). Under normal conditions, the 

passage is kept empty of the load. When an imminent storm 
is anticipated, a given amount of liquid or solid is 

transferred into the passage (6) located within the stiffening 
girder (4) to temporarily apply a given amount of temporary 

dead load to the stiffening girder (4) during a storm to 
control vibrations of the bridge caused by the winds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a suspension bridge according to the preamble of claim 1,
and more particularly, to the structure of a suspension
bridge of which static characteristics and aerodynamic
stability are improved by applying a temporary dead load as
an additional mass when the bridge is exposed to conditions
such as violent storm that would cause particularly
rigorous swaying of the suspension bridge.As a countermeasure against strong winds, suspension
bridges are provided with an additional mass such as water
and concrete in the stiffening girder to control the
vertical and torsional vibrations of the girder. Such
suspension bridges are known from, for example, Japanese
Patent Publication Sho 47-44944, Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open Sho 60-192007, USP No. 4,665,578, and
Japanese Patent Application Laid-open Sho 63-134701.Suspension bridges disclosed in JP Publication Sho
47-44944 and JPA Laid-open Sho 63-134701 utilize the
dynamic energy of water pooled in advance in the stiffening
girder to absorb the vertical and torsional vibrations of
the girder during a storm, while those according to JPA 
Laid-open Sho 60-192007 and USP No. 4,665,578 reduce such
vertical and torsional vibrations by arranging a pre-fixed
amount of additional mass in the girder.These bridge structures all utilize an additional mass
such as water and concrete placed in the stiffening girder
or the tower columns to reduce the vertical and torsional
vibrations in the girder. As such, the additional mass is
included as a part of the design dead load.Generally, bridges are designed by considering the
normal conditions when the dead load and the live load
mainly of moving vehicles are working, and the stormy
conditions when the wind load as well as the dead load
plays a vital role. The smaller the dead load of the main
cable, anchors, towers, hungers, etc. that are designed by
considering the vertical load, the better it is in terms of
economy under the normal conditions. Conversely, the
heavier the dead load, the static characteristics and
aerodynamic stability against vibrations improve under
stormy conditions. In the case of a stiffening girder of
suspension bridge which is mainly designed to safeguard
against stormy conditions, the girder can be made smaller
in sectional area if a heavier temporary dead load is
assigned, which in turn contributes to cost reduction of
the girder itself.Conventional countermeasures of applying an additional
mass of water, concrete or the like to the stiffening 
girder in advance as

<CLAIMS>
A stiffening girder type suspension bridge comprising a main
cable (1), anchors (2) retaining the tensile force occurring on

the main cable (1), plural towers (3) supporting the main cable
(1), a stiffening girder (4) for distributing the live load acting

on the bridge floor (10), hungers (5) for suspending the stiffening
girder (4) from the main cable (1) and a space for accommodating

a given additional mass provided in the stiffening girder
(4) along the direction of bridge axis at the center of the girder

width,

characterized in that said space is a passage (6, 6a, 6b, 16) provided
within the stiffening girder (4) and that said bridge is provided with means for transporting and accommodating

a temporary dead load as said additional mass to be
accommodated temporarily only at the time of a hurricane or storm,

within said passage.
The bridge as claimed in Claim 1,

characterized in that said temporary dead load as said additional
mass is a liquid such as water that can flow into the passage (6,

6a, 6b) to be pooled therein or drained therefrom.
The bridge as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that said
temporary dead load as said additional mass is made of vehicles

(17) such as trains, tramcars and trailers that can move into the
passage (16), carrying a liquid such as water or a solid such as

soil, sand, stone, concrete and metal.
The bridge according to one of Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that the weight of the temporary dead load to be
accommodated is at least equal to that of the live load and is

about 50% of the product obtained by multiplying the dead load
under the normal conditions with the ultimate safety factor of

1.5.
