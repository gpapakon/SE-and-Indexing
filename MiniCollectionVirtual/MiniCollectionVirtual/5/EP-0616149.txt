<ABSTRACT>
A kinetic energy regenerating device utilizes 
the principle of perfectly elastic collision through an 

elastic member between a rotating body on the driving 
side and a flywheel to regenerate kinetic energy at a 

high regenerating efficiency. The kinetic energy 
regenerating device (1) comprises a main shaft (2) 

connected to the output shaft of a driving means, a main 
disk (5) fixedly mounted on the main shaft (2), a first 

rotor (6) supported on the main shaft (2) for rotation 
relative to the main shaft (2), a flywheel (10) supported 

on the main shaft (2) for rotation relative to the main 
shaft (2), a first clutch (9) for engaging the main disk 

(5) and the first rotor (6) and disengaging the same from 
each other, and a torsion coil spring (16) elastically 

interlocking the first rotor (6) and the flywheel (10). 
The rotational energy of the main disk (5) is transmitted 

through the first clutch (9) to the first rotor (6) to 
rotate the flywheel (10) and, at the same time, to twist 

the torsion coil spring (16). Thus, the perfectly 
elastic collision between the rotational components on 

the driving side and the flywheel (10) through the 
torsion coil spring (16) is utilized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a kinetic energy 
regenerating device for recovering the kinetic energy of a 
rotating body and, more particularly, to a kinetic energy 
regenerating device capable of operating at a high regenerating 
efficiency by using the perfectly elastic collision between a 
rotor on the driving side and a flywheel separated from each 
other by an elastic member. Generally, a conventional kinetic energy regenerating 
device drives a generator by the rotative force of a rotary 
body to convert the rotational energy into electric energy by 
the generator and, in a regenerating mode, a motor or the like 
is driven by the electric energy to produce rotative force. Since the conventional kinetic energy regenerating device 
must convert rotational energy into electric energy and convert 
the electric energy into rotational energy in the regenerating 
mode, a large amount of energy loss is incurred by energy 
conversion and, hence, the regenerating efficiency of the 
kinetic energy regenerating device is not very high. DE-A-2 521 410 discloses a kinetic energy regenerating 
device in which a main disc fixed to a rotary shaft is 
selectively coupled to a rotatable body using a clutch-type 
coupling element. The rotatable body in its turn is connected 
to a series of concentric flywheels by means of a helical 
spring connected to an electro-magnetic coupling element. To solve the low efficiency problem of the conventional 
kinetic energy regenerating device, the present invention 
provides a kinetic energy regenerating device comprising a main 
disk to be driven for rotation by a driving means, a first 
rotary body supported for free rotation on a main shaft, a 
flywheel supported for free rotation on the main shaft, a first 
clutch for  
 
engaging the main disk and the first rotary body and 
disengaging the same from each other, and an energy 
storage means interposed between the first rotary body 
and the flywheel to store energy temporarily. In the kinetic energy regenerating device in 
accordance with the present invention, the rotative force 
of the main disk is transmitted through the clutch to 
the first rotary body, and the first rotary body 
transmits the rotative force transmitted thereto through 
the energy storage means to the flywheel. Therefore, the 
energy storage means is able to transmit most of the 
rotative force to the flywheel while converting part of 
the rotational energy of the first rotary body into 
elastic energy and temporarily storing the elastic 
energy, and
