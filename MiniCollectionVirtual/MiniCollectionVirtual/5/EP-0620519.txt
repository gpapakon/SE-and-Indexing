<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device (INF/DFUZ) which is for inference generation and defuzzification, and consists of an arithmetic unit (RW), a memory/register unit (SR/REG), and a control unit (CTRL). In it, sharp output signals (CO) can be formed from weighting factors (G) and measurement numbers (M(OMF)), depending on control signals (A, V). A weighting factor is provided for each linguistic value of the output variables, and the measurement numbers characterise the association functions (OMF) of the linguistic values of the output variables. The advantage which is achieved by the invention, particularly for resolutions of the sharp output signal greater than or equal to 8 bits, is the high processing speed and low memory space requirement.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (INF/DFUZ) for inferencing and
defuzzification, comprising an arithmetic unit (RW), a

memory/register unit (SP/REG) and a control mechanism
(CTRL),


in which sharp output signals (CO) are formed from
weighting factors (G) and dimension figures (M(OMF)) as

a function of control signals (A, V), wherein there is
a weighting factor for each linguistic value of the

output variables, and the dimension figures
characterize the association functions (OMF) of the

linguistic values of the output variables,

characterized in that a first dimension figure in each
case indicates the area (F), and a second dimension

figure in each case indicates a centre of gravity

coordinate (S) of a respective association function
(OMF) of a linguistic value of an output variable;
in that the first and the second dimension figures are
stored in a knowledge base memory (KBM);
in that the apparatus is arranged such that an
inference is produced by forming the product, for each

linguistic value of the output variables, of the
dimension figure for the respective area (F) and the

respective weighting factor (G), and these are added to
form an overall area;
and in that the apparatus is arranged such that
defuzzification (COG) is carried out using the centre

of gravity method in that the product is formed, for
each linguistic value of the output variables, of the 

dimension figure for the respective area, the dimension
figure for the respective centre of gravity coordinate

and the respective weighting factor, and these are
added to form a total moment, and in that the sharp

output value (CO) is calculated from the quotient of
the total moment divided by the total area,
Apparatus (INF/DFUZ) for inferencing and
defuzzification, comprising an arithmetic unit (RW), a

memory/register unit (SP/REG) and a control mechanism
(CTRL),


in which sharp output signals (CO) are formed from
weighting factors (G) and dimension figures (M(OMF)) as

a function of control signals (A, V), wherein there is
a weighting factor for each linguistic value of the

output variables, and the dimension figures
characterize the association functions (OMF) of the

linguistic values of the output variables,

characterized in that a first dimension figure in each
case represents the maximum value (H) of the

association function of the respective linguistic value
of the output variables, and a second dimension figure

in each case represents the mean value (P) of those
values at which the maximum value (H) is in each case

reached,
in that a third dimension figure (B) in each case
represents the number of elements in the association

functions of a respective linguistic value of the
output variables;
in that the first, second and third dimension figures
are stored in a knowledge base memory (KBM);
and in that the apparatus is arranged such that
inference is formed by forming the product, for each

linguistic value of the output variables, of the first
dimension figure (H) and the respective weighting (G).
Apparatus according to Claim 2,

arranged such that defuzzification (MOM) is carried
out, in which the coordinate of the maximum value is

determined if there is one maximum value, and the mean
value of these coordinates is determined if there are a 

plurality of identical maximum values, in that these
products are compared with one another and at least one

linguistic value with a maximum product is established,
such that, if there is only one linguistic value with a
maximum product, the second dimension figure (P)

associated with the linguistic value having the maximum
product corresponds to the sharp output value, and
such that, otherwise, a mean value is produced from the
second dimension figures (P) of the linguistic values

with a maximum product in such a manner that the second
dimension figure (P) of the linguistic values with a

maximum product is in each case multiplied by the
respective third dimension figure (B) and these are

added to form a sum, and
such that the sharp output value (CO) is calculated by
forming the quotient of this sum divided by the sum of

the third dimension figures (B).
Apparatus according to Claim 2,

arranged such that defuzzification (MMM) is carried
out, in which the coordinate of the maximum value is

determined if there is one maximum value, and the mean
value of the smallest and largest coordinates is

determined if there are a plurality of identical
maximum values, in that the products formed in the

inference process are compared with one another and at
least one linguistic value having a maximum product is

established,
such that a sum of the third dimension figures (B) is
formed from linguistic values with a maximum product,

with a further third dimension figure (B) of the
linguistic value with a maximum product being added in

each summation step,
such that, during renewed summation of the third
dimension figures (B) of linguistic values with a

maximum product, a partial sum is compared after each
summation step with half the sum of all the third

dimension figures of linguistic values with a maximum
product, 
such that, if the partial sum is greater than half the
sum of the third dimension figures of linguistic values

with a maximum product, the sharp output value (CO) is
calculated by addition of the second dimension figure

(P) of the respective summation step and half the third
dimension figure (B) of the respective summation step

and by subtraction of half the sum, and,
if the partial sum is not greater than half the sum of
the third dimension figures of linguistic values with a

maximum product, half the sum is reduced, in each
summation step, by the third dimension figure (B) of

the respective summation step.
Use of an apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims in a fuzzy logic coprocessor whose

sharp output value (CO) resolution is greater than
8 bits.
