<ABSTRACT>
Sports shoe, particularly usable for skiing or skating, 
including a shell (2) with which at least one quarter (3) is 

associable; the shell has a longitudinal opening (4) that is 
asymmetrical toward the outer region of the foot. The 

opening can be temporarily closed by means of at least one 
flap (9) which is preferably made of a less rigid material 

than the shell. The sports shoe thus has components that 
selectively comply with the various technical requirements 

during sports practice.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sports shoe
particularly usable for skiing or skating.Currently, it is known to manufacture for these two
sports a shoe which usually comprises a shell made of
plastics with which at least one quarter, also made of
plastics, is associable.Particularly in skiing, the skier needs to transfer
from the foot to the ski all the forces required for correct
sports practice.There is also the problem of combining good comfort of
the boot with the possibility of easy insertion of the foot
inside the boot.U.S. patent No. 3,325,920 discloses a ski boot
comprising a rigid outer shell in which a lateral opening is
formed at the inner foot region by virtue of a swinging
element that is pivoted to the shell.This solution is structurally very complicated, since
it requires the presence of various elements that must be
pivoted and temporarily coupled to one another to allow the
skier to practice sport comfortably; this solution
furthermore requires covering elements to provide
watertightness.Lateral entry of the foot is thus not easy for the user
due to the large number of actions he must perform to
achieve this insertion: furthermore, it should be stressed
that the rigidity of the shell in all its parts limits its
comfort during sports practice.Furthermore, there is the drawback due to the fact that
efforts are not optimally transferred from the boot to the 
ski, since the swinging element tends to open under stress.U.S. patent No. 3,405,463 also relates to a ski boot having a rigid shell to which a
swinging element is hinged in the rear lateral region so as to provide an opening at the inner
lateral foot region.This solution, too, has the above-described drawbacks, with the addition of the fact
that, as in the previous case, efforts are not transferred well from the boot to the ski, since
the swinging element tends to open under stress.EP-A-0521288 discloses a hiking boot provided with a rigid heel piece and a rigid
rear cuff which is articulated to the rigid heel piece. The upper of the boot is provided with
conventional laces for closing a central opening, and a flexible covering element for
covering the upper has a zipper opening extending essentially from the front toe region
backwardly and laterally towards the malleolus region.The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the described technical problems,
solving the drawbacks of the above-mentioned prior art by a sports shoe that provides the
user with optimum transfer of efforts during sports practice.Within the scope of

Sports shoe according to claim 1, characterized in that tabs (8,108)
protrude from the perimetric edge of said wall, said tabs constituting means for

associating said at least one applied flap to said wall.
Sports shoe according to claim 2, characterized in that said flap is secured
to said shell at the inner lateral region by means of adapted levers (11) provided

with tensioning elements (12) that interact with adapted racks (13) associated with
said shell or with said quarter.
Sports shoe according to any one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said opening (4,104,204) affects the outer lateral region

(5,105) of the foot, the outer lateral malleolar region (14,114), and the lateral region
(15,115) of the adjacent part of the leg.
