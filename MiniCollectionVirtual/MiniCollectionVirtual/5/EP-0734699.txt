<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to an expandable 
stent (10) for implantation in a body lumen, such as an 

artery, and a method for making it from a single length 
of tubing. The stent (10) consists of a plurality of 

radially expandable cylindrical elements (12) generally 
aligned on a common axis and interconnected by one or 

more interconnective elements (13). The individual 
radially expandable cylindrical elements (12) consist of 

ribbon-like material disposed in an undulating pattern. 
The stents (10) are made by coating a length of tubing 

(21) with an etchant-resistive material and then 
selectively removing portions of the coating to form a 

pattern for the stent (10) on the tubing (21) to expose 
the portions of the tubing to be removed. This may be 

done by machine-controlled activation and relative 
positioning of a laser (24) in conjunction with the 

coated tubing (21). After the patterning of the tubing 
(21), the stent (10) is formed by removing exposed 

portions of the tubing (21) by an etching process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of expandable
endoprosthesis devices, generally called stents, which
are adapted to be implanted into a patient's body lumen,
such as blood vessel, to maintain the patency thereof.
These devices are very useful in the treatment of
atherosclerotic stenosis in blood vessels.Stents are generally tubular shaped devices
which function to hold open a segment of a blood vessel
or other anatomical lumen. They are particularly
suitable for use to support and hold back a dissected
arterial lining which can occlude the fluid passageway
therethrough.Further details of prior art stents can be
found in U.S. Patent 3,868,956 (Alfidi et al.); U.S.
Patent 4,512,338 (Balko et al.); U.S. Patent 4,553,545
(Maass et al.); U.S. Patent 4,733,665 (Palmaz); U.S.
Patent 4,762,128 (Rosenbluth); U.S. Patent 4,800,882
(Gianturco); U.S. Patent 4,856,516 (Hillstead); and U.S.
Patent 4,886,062 (Wiktor).Various means have been described to deliver
and implant stents. One method frequently described for
delivering a stent to a desired intralumenal location
includes mounting the expandable stent on an expandable
member, such as a balloon, provided on the distal end of
an intravascular catheter, advancing the catheter to the
desired location within the patient's body lumen,
inflating the balloon on the catheter to expand the stent
into a permanent expanded condition and then deflating 
the balloon and removing the catheter. One of the
difficulties encountered using prior stents involved
maintaining the radial rigidity needed to hold open a
body lumen while at the same time maintaining the
longitudinal flexibility of the stent to facilitate its
delivery.What has been needed and heretofore unavailable
is a stent which has a high degree of flexibility so that
it can be advanced through tortuous passageways and can
be readily expanded and yet have the mechanical strength
to hold open the body lumen into which it is expanded.Hereinafter there is described an
expandable stent which is relatively flexible along its
longitudinal axis to facilitate delivery through tortuous
body lumens, but which is stiff and stable enough
radially in an expanded condition to maintain the patency
of a body lumen such as an artery when implanted therein.The described stent generally includes
a plurality of radially expandable cylindrical elements
which are relatively independent in their ability to
expand and to flex relative to one another. The individual
radially expandable cylindrical elements of the stent are
dimensioned

<CLAIMS>
The process of making a stent comprising the
steps of:


a) applying a coating resistive to chemical
etching to a length of tubing;
b) selectively removing portions of the resistive
coating to expose sections of the tubing; and
c) removing exposed portions of the tubing by
chemical etching thereby forming a pattern of apertures

defining the stent.
The process of claim 1 wherein a plurality of
stents are made from a single piece of tubing.
The process of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
stent is made from a biocompatible material selected

from the group consisting of polymers, stainless steel,
titanium, superelastic NiTi alloys and tantalum.
The process of any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
the coating is applied by electrophoretic deposition.
The process of any of claims 1 to 4, wherein
the step of selectively removing portions of the

resistive coating to expose sections of the tubing is
accomplished with a laser.
The process of claim 5 wherein the selective
removal of the resistive coating is accomplished by

machine controlled relative movement of the tubing and
the laser.
The process of claim 5 or claim 6 wherein the
laser used to selectively remove the resistive coating 

emits a particular wavelength of light which is readily
absorbable by the resistive coating.
The process of any of claims 5 to 7 wherein
the laser is a C0

 gas laser.
The process of any preceding claim wherein the
resistive coating used is a photolithographic chemically

resistive coating.
