<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and to a system for supporting communication for a first user (U) who desires to be able to communicate with second foreign users (F) in an environment in which communication can take place via several different telecommunication networks (N1-N3). The first user in each telecommunication network has an address (D-ID) which is used by the foreign users when making a call. The invention is characterized in that calls which use this address (D-ID) instead of being terminated by the user are terminated by an intermediary (ES). The intermediary (ES) communicates as the receiving party to the calling party, in accodance with predetermined instructions given by the first user (U). The intermediary (ES) either performs a predetermined procedure or establishes communication with the first user in accordance with the instructions given. The user is therewith afforded the possibility of taking a dynamic position with regard to how each cal shall be dealt with.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
arrangement for supporting communication.More specifically, the invention relates to a method
and an arrangement for supporting communication for a
first user who desires the possibility of communicating
with other, foreign users in an environment in
which communication can take place through the intermediary
of several different communication networks,
wherein the first user in each telecommunication
network has an address which is used by the foreign to
make calls.The present invention is related to the following five
patent applications:
1) "A Method of Producing an Intelligent Network
Service", our WO93/16543;2) "A Method of Establishing a Connection", our WO93/16544;3) "A Method of Organizing Communication", our WO93/16545;4) "A Method of Establishing Cooperation with a
Functionality", our WO93/16547; and5) "A Paging Method", our WO93/16564.These applications are enclosed as an annex to the
present description and describe mechanisms which can
be used in the method according to the present invention.By communication services is meant conventional telephony
services, telex services, datapack services,
datel services, telefax services, videotext services,
ISDN-services, mobile telephony services, personal
paging services, tele-point-services and general
communication between two or more parties. The services
recited above are only examples of the services
possible and are not intended to limit the scope of
the invention.By telecommunication network is normally meant the
telephone networks, telex networks, circuit connected
data networks, picture information transfer networks,
private telecommunication networks, radio networks,
satellite communication networks and general carriers
of the communication services, such as analog transmission,
digital transmission, synchronous, multiplex
or asynchronous multiplex transmission, ATM, etc., for
example. These networks are recited solely by way of
example and the invention is not restricted thereto.By functionality is meant the ability to perform an
operation in a telecommunication network. Examples of
functionality include activities and services that can
be performed in the telecommunication network. Examples
of functionalities include an enquiry to establish
a connection path or route between two parties,
digit analysis, billing or ticketing. Although not
necessary, the functionality may require the availability 
of dedicated equipment for carrying out the
functionality. For instance, if the functionality

<CLAIMS>
A method of supporting communication to and from a first
user (U) who desires the possibility to communicate with other

external users (F); wherein communication towards the first user
takes place via an intermediary (ES) which communicates as

receiving party in relation to the external users (F) in
accordance with predetermined instructions given by the first

user, hereinafter referred to as the customer (U), said
intermediary , depending on said instructions, (a) either

following a predetermined procedure or (b) establishing
communication with the customer so that the customer will be able

to take dynamically a stand as to how to deal with individual calls,

 by the following steps:

providing an environment in which an external user (F) can
communicate with the customer (U) over several different

telecommunication networks (N1-N3);
providing the customer (U), in each one of said
telecommunica
tion networks, with a first and a second address (D-ID
and U-ID respectively),
terminating the first and the second addresses in said
intermediary,
an external user (F) using the first address for an incoming
call to the customer,
the customer (U) using the second address (U-ID) for an
outgoing call to an external user (F); the intermediary in this

case in its turn establishing a connection with the called
external user (F),
the intermediary (ES) communicating with a calling or called
external user (F) over a first telecommunication network (N1, N2,

N3) and with the customer (U) over a second telecommunication
network (N1-N3) which may or may not be identical with the first

network.
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that when called by an external user (F), the intermediary
(ES)


stores an identification (F-REC-REF) that is related to the
call;
alerts the customer (U) over one of the second telecommunication

instructions given.
A method according to Claim 3, 
characterized

in that the customer (2) instructs the intermediary:

to immediately establish communication with the external user
(F) over one of the first telecommunication networks; and
to deliver a predetermined message to the external user
without establishing immediate communication with said external

user.
