member (5) while the other is provided with a magnet (8). The superconducting member (5) includes a superconductor 

(4) for floating the magnet (8) and a support (3) for supporting the superconductor (4). The magnet (8) includes a ring-like magnet 
(11) which is coaxial with the axis of the rotary member A, and the ring-like magnet (11) and the superconductor member (5)

and 11B) having mutually different diameters, and the ring-like magnets (11A and 11B) are magnetized so that the directions of 

magnetic fluxes face slantingly with one another.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a superconducting bearing 
using a superconductor, which is used for, for example, a 
fluid machine or machine tool which needs a high speed 
rotation, and a power storage device which reserves an 
excess power by converting it into the kinetic energy of a 
fly wheel. Lately, a superconductor has been used to develop a 
superconducting bearing which allows a high speed rotation 
by axially supporting a rotor (rotation axis) in a non-contact 
state. As shown in Fig. 38, a superconducting 
bearing first consists of one ring-like permanent magnet 32 
which is coaxially disposed on a rotor (rotation axis) 31 
having the axis perpendicularly arranged and has both ends 
along the axial direction of the rotor 31 mutually 
magnetized in opposite polarities, and a ring-like 
superconductor 33 disposed to oppose the opposite face of 
the permanent magnet 32 with a gap therebetween in the 
direction of the rotating axis (For example, Japanese Patent 
Application No. 51430/1991). In Fig. 38, 34 represents a 
circular plate attached to the rotor 31, 35 a permanent  
 
magnet comprising the ring-like permanent magnet 32 and the 
circular plate 34, 36 a circular plate support to which the 
superconductor 33 is fixed, 37 a superconductor member 
comprising the superconductor 33 and the circular plate 
support 36, 38 a cooling case, 39 a temperature control 
unit, and 40 a refrigerator. A conventional superconducting bearing is then 
proposed, to enhance a load capacity and stiffness, to 
dispose for example two ring magnets 32A, 32B to adjoin each 
other to increase the surface area of magnets as shown in 
Fig. 39. And, to further improve a loading force, two ring 
magnets 32A, 32B are reversely magnetized from the axial 
direction as shown in Fig. 40. In Fig. 39 and Fig. 40, 
setting is made to be a=b=30 mm. However, according to the prior art of the above 
publication, an integral ring-like permanent magnet which 
can be used for a small bearing has a drawback of being 
difficult to be used for a larger bearing in view of the 
production and magnetization. Specifically, to form a large-sized bearing, it is 
necessary to produce an integral ring-like permanent magnet 
having a large diameter. Generally, a powerful magnet 
having a large energy product includes rare earth magnets, 
and an Nd-Fe-B magnet is known as the most powerful rare 
earth magnet at present. But, since this magnet is produced  
 
by a sintering method, a larger making machine and higher 
pressure are required as its size
