<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process for connecting an integrated 
circuit to an external circuit comprising the steps of: 


aligning the integrated circuit with respect to the external 
circuit; 
providing a layer of anisotropic material between the 
integrated circuit and the external circuit; and 
connecting by thermocompression said integrated circuit to 
said external circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for connecting an 
integrated circuit to an external circuit. More particularly, the invention is included between the 
microelectronics technologies concerning the packaging of integrated 
circuits, and still more precisely in the kind of products so-called 
"consumer products". As it is well known, the VLSI circuits are realized integrating 
hundred thousands of elementary components connected each other in a 
silicon plate. The development occurred in the recent years allows to 
continuously increase the number of components for unitary area of 
silicon. This fact involves the realization of always more little and 
complex silicon chips, and consequently an always higher number of 
connections with the external circuit. It is also known that in order to realize such a connections two 
kinds of problems must be faced and solved: the reduction of the density 
of the connections from the silicon level to the connection pad level of the 
printed circuit and the protection of the chip against mechanical shocks 
and environmental attacks. The above problems have been faced up and solved until now 
by the package encapsulating the chip. In fact, the package realizes a protection of the chip, bringing 
its electrical connections to a density compatible with the printed circuit, 
being at the same time realized in such a way that it can be used with the 
standard fabrication techniques employed in this field (e.g. welding 
process employing tin/lead alloys melting at about 200Â°C). Generally speaking, the introduction of the package, although 
solves the above mentioned problems, involves a remarkable increasing 
of costs, dimensions and weight of the device obtained, and requires the 
adoption of particular precautions when it is subjected to high thermal 
gradients and/or extreme temperatures typical of certain welding 
processes. In other words, a reduction of the efficiency of the chip and a 
limitation of its potentialities are present.  Among the different packaging technologies, the one providing 
the use of plastic packages can be mentioned. This kind of package requires the use of a lead-frame 
sustaining the chip and creating the external contacts of the package, of 
the wires connecting the chip to the lead-frame, of the plastic resins 
encasing the connection and giving the desired shape to the package, 
the adoption of processes like the deposition and the hardening of the 
alloy fixing the chip to the lead-frame, the welding of the connecting wires,
