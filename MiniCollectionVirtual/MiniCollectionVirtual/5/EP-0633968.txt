<ABSTRACT>
A work vehicle control assembly has a plurality of actuating levers each associated with a respective actuating element (10, 12, 14) for controlling respective movements of a work implement of the work vehicle, for example an excavator. The control assembly of this invention has a cam operated moveable gate which captures portions of the actuating elements (10, 12, 14) and controllably locks them in a preselected position in response to actuation of a lock actuation lever (72).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to a 
locking mechanism for implement controlling components 
of a work vehicle as known from US-A-4 036 077. Various heavy duty work vehicles have a 
plurality of implement controlling components for 
manipulating an implement of the work vehicle. An 
example of such as vehicle would be a wheel loader 
which has a plurality of levers for manipulating the 
earth moving bucket through a multiplicity of 
positions. A common problem in the manufacture of such 
massive vehicles is to easily control a plurality of 
bucket movements by as few operator actions as 
possible. Placement and position of control levers, 
one relative to others, also becomes a problem since 
it is most common during various bucket maneuvers to 
simultaneously or generally simultaneously operate 
several controlling levers. Overall efficiency of 
vehicle operations often depends on the operator's 
skill in adjusting and manipulating the correct levers 
in the correct sequence at the optimum times. In one operation of wheel loaders, for 
example, it is desirable to lock a plurality of 
controlling components at a preselected position for a 
desirable time during manipulation of other 
controlling components. For example, locking of the 
lift and tilt kickout controlling components. To 
increase efficiency of operation, it is desirable for 
the operator to initiate locking or releasing of these  
 
components in response to as few operator movements as 
possible. The present invention is directed to 
overcoming one or more of the problems as set forth 
above. In one aspect of the present invention a 
work vehicle has a control assembly which has a 
plurality of implement actuation levers. Each 
actuation lever is associated with a respective 
actuating element for controlling respective movements 
of an implement of the work vehicle in response to 
pivotal movement of the actuating elements responsive 
to movement of the respective actuation lever. The 
actuating elements each have a longitudinal axis, a 
first end portion connected to and pivotally connected 
to a frame and a latchable element extending generally 
along the actuating element axis and outwardly 
therefrom. A gate of the invention has a cam surface 
and a plurality of spaced apart slots. Each slot has 
an axis extending in a first direction and a latch 
opening communicating with the slot and extending a 
second direction transverse the slot. Each slot is of 
a size sufficient to receive a respective latchable 
element for movement along

<CLAIMS>
In a work vehicle control assembly 
having a plurality of implement actuation levers each 

associated with a respective actuating element 
(10,12,14) for controlling respective movements of an 

implement of the work vehicle in response to pivotal 
movement of the actuating elements (10,12,14) in 

response to movement of the respective actuation 
lever, said actuating elements (10,12,14) each having 

a longitudinal axis, a first end portion (16,18,20) 
pivotally connected to a frame (22) and a latchable 

element (24,26,28) extending generally along the 
actuating element axis and outwardly from a second end 

portion (30,32,34) of the actuating element 
(10,12,14), the improvement comprising: 


a gate (36) having a cam surface (38) and a 
plurality of spaced apart slots (40,42,44), each slot 

(40,42,44) having an axis extending in a first 
direction with a latch opening communicating with said 

slot and extending in a second direction transverse 
the slot axis, each slot (40,42,44) being of a size 

sufficient to receive a respective latchable element 
(24,26,28) for movement along the slot in response to 

movement of said respective lever and said gate (36) 
being moveable in the second direction between a first 

position at which the latchable elements (24,26,28) 
are positioned within a respective slot (40,42,44) and 

free to move along said slot (40,42,44) and a second 

position at which the latchable elements are within 
respective latch openings (46,48,50) and maintaining 

said latchable element (24,26,28) and associated 
actuating elements (10,12,14) against pivotal 

movement;  
 
means (52) for biasing the gate in the 
second direction; 
a cam (54) follower contactable with the cam 
surface (56) of the gate (36) and being moveable along 

the cam surface for moving the gate (36) between the 
first and second positions; 
a first rotatable shaft (58) having a 
longitudinal axis and being connected to the cam 

follower (54) and being rotatable for controllably 
moving the cam follower (54) along the cam surface 

(56) of the gate (36); 
a first link (60) connected to the first 
rotatable shaft (58), extending transverse the first 

rotatable shaft axis and being moveable therewith; 
a second rotatable shaft (62) having a 
longitudinal axis extending generally parallel to said 

first rotatable shaft (58); 
a second link (64) connected to the second 
rotatable shaft (62), extending transverse the second 

rotatable shaft axis and being moveable therewith; 
a connecting link (66) having first and 
second end portions (68,70), said first end portion 

(68) being pivotally connected to said first link (60) 
and said second end portion (70) being pivotally 

connected to said second link (64); and 
a lock actuation lever (72) connected to the 
second rotatable shaft (62) for controllably rotating 

the second rotatable shaft (62) and responsively

and pivotally moveable about a common axis.  

 
A work vehicle control assembly, as set 
forth in claim 1, wherein the axis of the actuating 

elements (10,12,14) at the locked position are at an 
angle in the range of about 0 to about 45 degrees 

relative to horizontal.
