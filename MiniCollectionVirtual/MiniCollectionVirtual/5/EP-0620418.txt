<ABSTRACT>
In an instrument and method for optically 
measuring a displacement of a scale which can achieve the 

noise elimination of returning light to a coherent light 
source, the scale and optical system are so constructed 

that an intersecting point of light fluxes radiated from 
the coherent light source and split into those fluxes by 

means of a first beam splitter is not present on a 
transmitting type diffraction grating and the incident 

lights (d, e) on a reflecting plate and the reflected 
lights (f, g) from the reflecting plate have no common 

pass the same light paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
instrument and optical method for measuring displacement 
of a scale. The present invention particularly relates to 
the optical instrument and method for measuring a 
position and/or velocity of a mobile body. Japanese Patent Application First Publications 
No. Showa 47-10034 (United States Patent Application 
Serial No. 73, 791 filed on September 21, 1970) published 
on May 22, 1972, No. Showa 63-75518 published on April 5, 
1988, and No. Heisei 2-85715 published on March 27, 1990 
exemplify previously proposed optical displacement 
measuring apparatuses which detect positional changes of 
moving diffraction gratings utilizing interferences in 
light. In each of the previously proposed optical 
displacement measuring apparatuses, a light flux (beams) 
radiated from a coherent light source is split into two 
light fluxes by means of a beam splitter, the two light 
fluxes are advanced through respectively separate light 
paths and incident on a diffraction grating constituting 
a scale, and generated diffraction lights thereon in an m 
order (m denotes 1 or larger integer) are obtained, and 
these two m-order diffracted light is recombined and a 
diffraction fringe of the recombined light flux is 
detected. A light source and optical detector are of 
transmission types in which they are opposed with the 
scale sandwiched and of reflection types in which they 
are in the same positions with respect to the scale.  
 In general, a volume type hologram is used as 
the diffraction grating for the transmitting type 
application. Especially, if the optical parts are 
arranged such as to satisfy a Bragg condition, a signal 
having a high output and high resolution can be derived. However, since the transmitting type requires 
the arrangements of the light source and detector such 
that they are disposed in mutually opposite positions to 
the scale, the compact of the optical displacement 
apparatus cannot be achieved. On the contrary, since the reflecting type 
requires the arrangements of light source and detector on 
the same positions to the scale, it is suitable for 
compacting the optical displacement instrument but it is 
difficult to achieve the high resolution instrument. With such a tradeoff as described above in 
mind, such a new optical displacement measuring 
instrument as having the advantages of the transmitting 
type with those of the reflecting type may be considered. 
However, a new problem would occur such that the 
adjustments of positions of the
