<ABSTRACT>
The described counter-bearing support consists of a plastic injection-moulded part and comprises a base body (1) with a mounting peg (4) and with two arms (5, 6) which form a bearing opening (7) for a counter-bearing spindle, and also comprises a covering cap (2). In order to simplify the assembly, there are integrally formed on the mounting peg (4) bent levers (9) which can be pivoted through 90 DEG , by insertion of the mounting peg (4) into an opening in the vehicle body, in order to reach behind the vehicle-body sheet with the first limbs (10) and to come to rest on the mounting peg (4) with the second limbs (11). The bent levers (9) can then be locked in this position by means of the covering cap which can be slid over the mounting peg (4) and which is designed with latching lugs (13) which engage in latching recesses (16) in the limbs (11).

Counter-bearing support for vehicle sun visors, 
which support is configured as a plastic injection 

moulding and has a fastening peg (4), which is not round 
in cross-section and, in the installed position, engages 

through a through-passage (3) in the bodywork, as well as 
two integrally formed-on arms (5, 6) which engage around 

the counter-bearing pin of a sun visor in a clamp-like 
manner and whose mutually facing sides form an undercut 

bearing opening (7) for the counter-bearing pin and an 
introduction slit which makes it possible for said pin to 

be plugged repeatedly into the bearing opening (7), 
characterized in that, on the free end region, the 

fastening peg (4) has two angle levers (9) which are 
integrally formed on opposite one another such that they 

can be pivoted via film hinges (8) and of which the first 
legs (10) run beyond the free peg end in the direction of 

said peg and the second legs (11) run transversely 
thereto, in that, by virtue of the fastening peg (4) 

being plugged into the through-passage (3) of the body-work, 
the angle levers (9) can be pivoted through 90Â° in 

order to engage behind the sheet metal (12) of the 
bodywork by means of the first legs (10) and to butt 

against the fastening peg by means of the second legs 
(11), and in that, in this position, the angle levers (9) 

can be locked by a covering cap (2) which can be pushed 
over the fastening peg (4) and is designed with latching 

lugs (13) engaging into latching recesses (16) of the 
second legs (11). 
Counter-bearing support according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that stop protuberances (19) which  

 
delimit the plug-in path are integrally formed on the 

fastening pin (4). 
Counter-bearing support according to Claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the covering cap (2) is also 

designed as a plastic injection moulding, and the latching 
lugs (13) are integrally formed thereon. 
Counter-bearing support according to at least one 
of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the latching lugs 

(13) are located on webs (14) which are integrally formed 
on the cap base and are designed with run-on ramps (15) 

for engaging over the second legs (11).
