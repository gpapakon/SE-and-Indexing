<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for sterilising fluid comprising an ozone chamber (10) in which ozone is generated. The ozone is evenly dispersed throughout the ozone/air mixture by a diffuser (13). The fluid and ozone mixture are thoroughly mixed in a chamber (18) and radiated with ultraviolet radiation which simultaneously releases atomic oxygen from the ozone and radiates the fluid to be treated.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLUID TREATMENTThe invention relates to treatment of fluids.The invention relates more particularly although not exclusively to sterilising fluids. Fluids which are usually defined as gases or liquids include for the purpose of this invention also slurries, homogeneous mixtures, such as soups, as well as effluent and the like. The methods and apparatuses of the inventions are capable of treating any mixture or material which can flow or be generally pumped through a chamber for treatment. The applications of current interest are food and beverage processing plants, water bottling plants, swimming pools, fish farming, aquariums, secondary effluent treatment or generally any polluted or foul smelling water or air.According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating fluids comprising thoroughly mixing the fluid with ozone in a chamber and subjecting the mixture to ultraviolet radiation to break down the ozone so that the fluid is simultaneously treated by oxygen atoms released by the radiation and by the radiation itself.The ozone may be mixed with a separate fluid in a diffuser and thorough mixing of the fluid with the fluid to be treated achieved by supplying the diffused ozone directly into the chamber.The separate fluids are preferably air or oxygen.According to another aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus for treating fluids comprising an ozone chamber in which 

 ozone is produced from air, a diffuser through which the ozone/air mixture is fed to an ultraviolet chamber so as to be thoroughly mixed with the fluid to be treated and exposed to ultraviolet radiation to simultaneously radiate the fluid and break down the ozone.The diffuser may include a micro-diffuser element to evenly disperse the ozone throughout the air mixture and the diffuser may be attached to one side of the ultraviolet chamber adjacent an input end at which the fluid to be treated is supplied to the ultraviolet chamber.An outlet may be provided between the ozone chamber and the ultraviolet chamber to release the ozone for use in another apparatus-Fluid treatment apparatuses according to the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: -Figure 1 is a front schematic view of one apparatus;Figure 2 is a sectional enlarged view of a micro diffuser for use in the apparatus.Figure 3 is a schematic plan view of another apparatus;Figure 4 is a schematic elevation of the other apparatus;Figure 5 is a schematic side view of the other

 CLAIMS
1. A method of treating fluids comprising thoroughly mixing th fluid with ozone in a chamber and subjecting the mixture t ultraviolet radiation to break down the ozone so that the fluid i simultaneously treated by oxygen atoms released by the radiation an by the radiation itself.
2. A method according to claim 1, including mixing the ozone wit a separate fluid in a diffuser and thoroughly mixing the fluid wit the fluid to be treated by supplying the diffused ozone directly Inte the chamber.
3. A method according to claim 2, In which the separate fluid is oxygen.
4. A method according to claim 2, in which the separate fluid is air.
5. Apparatus for treating fluids comprising an ozone chamber in which ozone is produced from air, a diffuser through which the ozone/air mixture is fed to an ultraviolet chamber so as to be thoroughly mixed with the fluid to be treated and exposed to ultraviolet radiation to simultaneously radiate the fluid and break down the ozone.
6. Apparatus according to claim 5, in which the diffuser includes a micro-diffuser element to evenly disperse the ozone throughout the 


 air mixture, and the diffuser is attached to one side of the chamber adjacent an input end at which the fluid to be treated is supplied to the chamber.
7. Apparatus according to claim 5 or 6, in which an outlet is 5 provided between the ozone chamber and the ultraviolet chamber to release the ozone for use in another apparatus.
8. Methods of treating fluids substantially as herein described with reference to the accompanying drawings.
9. Apparatus for treating fluids substantially as herein described 10 with reference to the accompanying drawings.
