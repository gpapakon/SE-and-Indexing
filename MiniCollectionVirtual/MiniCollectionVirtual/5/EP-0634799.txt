<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a signal propagation delay diode (velocity-modulated diode) having double drift structure. In a generation region (G), electron/hole pairs are formed, which pairs relax into separate energy minima (Ln, Lp) and are from there injected, via a barrier in each case, by means of thermionic emission into separate drift regions (D1, D2).
