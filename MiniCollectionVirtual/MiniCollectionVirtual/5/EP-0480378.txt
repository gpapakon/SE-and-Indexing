<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structured cultivation medium 
which comprises at least three layers (1, 2, 3; 27, 26, 

25) of synthetic plastic material, a top layer (1; 27) for 
turf cultivation, a middle layer (2; 26) to protect the 

roots and a bottom layer (3; 25) to drain water. According 
to another aspect of the invention a waterproofing method 

for the installation of such a structured cultivation medium 
is provided, wherein a root blocking waterproofing 

layer (25) is laid on the surface of a roof slab (21) to 
waterproof the building 
and to guard against the downward 
encroachment of roots. A net (4; 28) is also laid on top 

of the turf both to prevent it from being damaged by wind 
and also protect it against concentrated loads. Thus the 

invention enables a rooftop cultivation of turf which can 
both be walked upon and which also helps to prevent temperatures 

from rising in rooms below the roof by shielding 
it against the sun.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the provision of a structured 
medium suitable for the soil-free cultivation of turf and 
other greenery on the roofs of buildings such as offices or 
apartment blocks, thereby improving the appearance of said 
buildings while at the same time providing lawns on which 
people are free to stroll and relax. Reference is also made 
to a system for the waterproofing of buildings on which said 
medium is installed. The roofs of buildings have for long now been fitted with 
systems of one sort or another to protect them from water 
damage. These systems can be divided into two broad types, 
namely the "protecting concrete" type of system and the  
 
"exposed waterproofing" type of system. The use of a 
protecting concrete type of system involves the laying first 
of an asphalt waterproofing course and then of the placing a 
layer of concrete over this in such a way that the asphalt 
waterproofing course cannot easily be damaged by the 
application of a concentrated load in any one place. This 
in turn makes it possible to walk on the roof. The use of 
the exposed waterproofing type of system, on the other hand, 
involves the laying of an asphalt waterproofing course only 
without the addition of a protective concrete covering with 
the result that the waterproofing course can easily be 
damaged by the application of a concentrated load. This 
type of roof covering is not, therefore, suitable for 
walking on. Bearing in mind the cost of land in urban 
centers, however, a comparison of these two types of system 
suggests that better value may be gained from the use of a 
protecting concrete system which can be walked on on a daily 
basis. However, the use of a protecting concrete system 
also necessitates the incorporation of expansion joints into 
the concrete layer as a means of allowing for thermal 
expansion and this also, of course, means substantial 
additional installation time and cost. Repair of the 
waterproofing layer also necessitates the prior removal of 
the concrete covering which creates a considerable job 
management headache of its own.  Moreover, for those living or working on the top floor of a 
building, the use of either the protecting concrete system 
or of the exposed waterproofing system gives rise to a 
similar environmental problem in that when the weather is 
very hot and the sun causes the roof itself to become 
extremely hot, the radiant heat heats the roof slab itself 
and the resultant heat is transferred into the room below. 
When this occurs there is
