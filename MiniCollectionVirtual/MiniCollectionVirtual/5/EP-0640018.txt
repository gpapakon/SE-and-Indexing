 DISPOSABLE UNIT DOSE DISPENSER FOR POWDERED MEDICANTS4 * BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to disposable unit dose dispensers, and more particularly, to such disposable unit dose5 dispensers having a gas chamber and a product reservoir adjacent to the gas chamber for fluidizing and dispensing powdered products, such as medicants, from the dispenser.2. Description of the Prior ArtThe prior art is replete with disposable containers for10 dispensing both liquid and powdered materials. Many of these containers are of the type which comprise a thermoformed blister and a cover sealed to a flange extending about the periphery of the thermoformed blister. The seal is normally accomplished by fusing the thermoplastic material of the blister and cover or a laminated15 heat sealable layer in either the blister or cover or both. Packages of this type are often used for single servings of condiments such as in fast food restaurants. The user typically peels the cover from the blister to access the contents.Another type of prior art disposable container is a disposable20 blister package which does not require the user to remove the cover to access the product. Instead, the user squeezes the blister causing a predetermined rupture site between the blister and cover to fail in response to pressure within the blister. The rupture site communicates with a second chamber which throttles the emerging25 product and provides controlled dispensing of the same. While providing improved convenience in dispensing liquid products, packages of the aforementioned type are not well suited to dispense powdered materials which need to be ejected from the dispenser.<f 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a unit dose dispenser is provided for fluidizing and dispensing a predetermined quantity of powdered product. The dispenser has a first flexible layer and a second flexible layer connected together to form a gas chamber and a product reservoir adjacent to the gas chamber. The gas chamber is adapted to store a predetermined quantity of powdered product. The product reservoir includes a delivery tube adapted to dispense the powdered product from the dispenser. The dispenser further includes a seal which separates the gas chamber from the product reservoir such that when pressure is applied to the gas chamber by squeezing the dispenser the seal ruptures causing a jet of gas to discharge from the gas chamber into the adjacent product reservoir

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS
1. A unit dose dispenser for fluidizing and dispensing a predetermined quantity of powdered product, said dispenser comprising a first layer and a second layer connected together to form a gas chamber and a product reservoir adjacent said gas chamber for storing said predetermined quantity of powdered product, said product reservoir including a delivery tube adapted to dispense said powdered product from said dispenser, said dispenser further including a seal which separates said gas chamber from said product reservoir such that when pressure is applied to said gas chamber by squeezing said dispenser said seal ruptures causing a jet of gas to discharge from said gas chamber into said adjacent product reservoir fluidizing and dispensing substantially all of said powdered product from said product reservoir through said delivery tube.
2. A unit dose dispenser according to Claim 1, wherein said first flexible layer is a laminated structure comprising of at least one polymeric layer and a heat sealable adhesive layer.
3. A unit dose dispenser according to either Claim 1 or Claim 2, wherein said second flexible layer is a laminated structure comprising of at least one polymeric layer and a heat sealable adhesive layer.
4. A unit dose dispenser according to any one of the preceding Claims, wherein said delivery tube includes a break line about which said delivery tube may be opened.
5. A unit dose dispenser according to any one of the preceding Claims, wherein said seal separating said gas chamber from said product reservoir includes a weakened portion to permit rupture thereof in response to squeezing forces applied to said dispenser. 


 6. A unit dose dispenser for fluidizing and dispensing a predetermined quantity of powdered product, said dispenser comprising a first flexible layer and a second flexible layer connected together to form a gas chamber and a product reservoir adjacent said gas chamber for storing said predetermined quantity of powdered product, said product reservoir including a delivery tube adapted to dispense said powdered product from said dispenser, said dispenser further including a seal having a weakened portion, said seal separating said gas chamber from said product reservoir such that when pressure is applied to said gas chamber by squeezing said dispense.r, said weakened portion in said seal ruptures causing a jet of gas to discharge from said gas chamber into said adjacent product reservoir fluidizing and dispensing substantially all of said powdered product from said product reservoir through said delivery tube.
7. A unit dose dispenser according to Claim 6, wherein said first flexible layer is a laminated structure comprising of at least one polymeric layer and a heat sealable adhesive layer.
8. A unit dose dispenser according to either Claim 6 or Claim 7, wherein said second flexible layer is a laminated structure comprising at least one polymeric layer and a heat sealable adhesive layer.
9. A unit dose dispenser according to any one of Claims 6, 7, or 8, wherein said delivery tube includes a break line about which said delivery tube may be opened.
