<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus is disclosed for drying extensive surfaces, comprising: means for transporting the entire apparatus across the surface (2), and an air knife (20) directed at the surface (22), the air knife comprising one or more nozzles; and means (56) for delivering air to the nozzle(s) at a high volume flow rate and low pressure. In a preferred arrangement, the or each nozzle has an outlet comprising an elongate slot. The apparatus may be used to clear surface water from roads, or sports areas before laying tarmac or markings, or for drying pitches whether grass or synthetic. Other uses may well occur to the reader. In another arrangement for drying slots or grooves in a road surface before sealing with tarmac, the nozzle is preferably not in the form of an elongate slot, e.g. is square or round in cross section. It is possible that the surface will remain damp if treated only with the air knife and, against this possibility, a much preferred embodiment of the invention includes an arrangement to heat the air supplied to the nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for drying
extensive surfaces.The background to the invention will be explained
in relation to a problem which occurs in a particular field,
although it will be recognised that the invention is not
limited to that field and may be utilised in other fields.Road markings are laid as a hot molten thermosetting
plastics compound, which includes a filler. As the compound
cools it sets to a solid which is intended to adhere to the
surface of the road. Unfortunately, even a very small
amount of moisture on the road surface prevents the
adhesion so that many working hours are lost each year while
road marking gangs wait for the surface to dry.One attempt to dry the surface involves a hollow
lance with a plenum chamber at one end from which open a
series of small orifices. Air under high pressure is
supplied to the plenum chamber by a compressor which is
readily available to a road working crew. The plenum
chamber is also supplied with a fuel, e.g. propane, which is
burnt in the compressed air in the chamber. The arrangement
does not work very well and the apparatus produces a great
deal of noise which is not acceptable to the workforce.The reader is referred to EP-A-0 340 692,
CH-A-377871 and CIVIL ENGINEERING-ASCE, vol. 39 no.2,
February 1969, page 33 ("A Russian project....").Against this background, in accordance with the
invention, there is provided apparatus for drying extensive
surfaces, comprising an air knife directed at the surface,
the air knife comprising one or more nozzles which has or
have an outlet comprising an elongate slot ;
means for delivering air to the nozzle(s) at a high
volume flow rate and low pressure, the total cross sectional 
area of the nozzle(s) at its or their outlet being
approximately equal to the cross sectional area of the
outlet of the blower means for delivering air through which
the outlet air is delivered, said apparatus either including
means for transporting the entire apparatus across the
surface, or being attached to a plant for treating the dried
surface.The arrangement efficiently strips water off the
surface and the noise may be kept down to a level acceptable
to the work force. The apparatus may be used to clear
surface water from roads, or sports areas before laying
tarmac or markings, or for drying pitches whether grass or
synthetic. Other uses may well occur to the reader.Despite the efficiency with which the apparatus may
strip water off the surface it is possible that the surface
will remain damp if treated only with the

Apparatus for drying extensive surfaces,
comprising an air knife directed at the surface, the air

knife comprising one or more nozzles which has or have an
outlet comprising an elongate slot;

means for delivering air to the nozzle(s) at a high
volume flow rate and low pressure, the total cross sectional

area of the nozzle(s) at its or their outlet being
approximately equal to the cross sectional area of the

outlet of the blower means for delivering air through which
the outlet air is delivered, said apparatus either including

means for transporting the entire apparatus across the
surface, or being attached to a plant for treating the dried

surface.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, including an
arrangement to heat the air supplied to the nozzle.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
the means for delivering air to the slot includes a blower

driven by a motor mounted in or on the apparatus or plant.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or 3,
wherein the arrangement

to heat the air includes a heater comprising a chamber, a
burner arranged to burn fuel in said air in the chamber, and

including means mounted in or on the apparatus for storing
the fuel and supplying it to the burner.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein a jet
engine constitutes both the arrangement to heat the air and

also the means for delivering air to the slot.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5, wherein the
engine is a fan jet. 
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the or each air knife comprises a plenum chamber

from which the outlet extends.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim,
when the apparatus is attached to said plant, wherein said

plant includes means for laying a thermosetting compound on
the dried surface.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8, wherein the
thermosetting compound comprises a rubberised filled bitumen

product or a compound for marking lines on the surface.
Apparatus as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the apparatus is automotive.
