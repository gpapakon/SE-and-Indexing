<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus automatically performs and monitors the 
extracorporeal treatment of the blood of a patient by any selected one 

of a plurality of predetermined treatments. Each of the treatments 
involves the flow of blood from the patient into a primary chamber 

(44) of a filtration unit (40), past a semipermeable membrane (42) 
located in the filtration unit (40) which separates the primary 

chamber (44) from a secondary chamber (46) of the filtration unit 
(40), out the filtration unit and back to the patient. A replacement 

fluid is selectively and controllably added to the blood, as required 
for the selected treatment. A secondary fluid is controllably and 

selectively introduced into the secondary chamber (46) of the 
filtration unit (40) for controllably collecting material passing 

across the semipermeable membrane (42) from the blood or for 
supplying material to pass across the semipermeable membrane (42) 

into the blood as required for the selected treatment. Materials are 
removed from the secondary chamber (46) and collected in accordance 

with the selected treatment. Upon selection of one of the plurality of 
extracorporeal blood treatments available, the rates of blood flow, 

fluid flow and fluid collection during the extracorporeal treatment 
are automatically determined, established and monitored in 

accordance with the selected treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to extracorporeal
treatment of blood, and more particularly, to a new and
improved apparatus and methodology for extracorporeal
treatment of blood in which any of a plurality of treatments
may be selected and automatically performed.Extracorporeal blood treatment involves
removing blood from a patient, treating the blood externally
to the patient, and returning the treated blood to
the patient. Extracorporeal blood treatment is typically
used to extract undesirable matter or molecules from
the patient's blood and/or add desirable matter or molecules
to the blood. Extracorporeal blood treatment is
used with patients unable to effectively remove matter
from their blood, such as when a patient has suffered
temporary or permanent kidney failure. These patients
and other patients may undergo extracorporeal blood
treatment to add or remove matter to their blood, to
maintain an acid/base balance or to remove excess
body fluids, for example.Extracorporeal blood treatment is typically
accomplished by removing the blood from the patient in
a continuous flow, introducing the blood into a primary
chamber of a filtration unit where the blood is allowed to
flow past a semipermeable membrane. The semipermeable
membrane selectively allows matter in the blood
to cross the membrane from the primary chamber into a
secondary chamber and also selectively allows matter
in the secondary chamber to cross the membrane into
the blood in the primary chamber, depending on the
type of treatment.A number of different types of extracorporeal
blood treatments may be performed. In an ultrafiltration
(UF) treatment, undesirable matter is removed from the
blood by convection across the membrane into the secondary
chamber. In a hemofiltration (HF) treatment, the
blood flows past the semipermeable membrane as in
UF and desirable matter is added to the blood, typically
by dispensing a fluid into the blood either before or after
it passes through the filtration unit and before it is
returned to the patient. In a hemodialysis (HD) treatment,
a secondary fluid containing desirable matter is
introduced into the secondary chamber of the filtration
unit. Undesirable matter from the blood crosses the
semipermeable membrane into the secondary fluid and
desirable matter from the secondary fluid may cross the
membrane into the blood. In a hemodiafiltration (HDF)
treatment, blood and secondary fluid exchange matter
as in HD, and, in addition, matter is added to the blood,
typically by dispensing a fluid into the treated
