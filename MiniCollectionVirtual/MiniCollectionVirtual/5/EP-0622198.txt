<ABSTRACT>
Spray (or satellite drops) in thermal ink-jet pens 
firing inks containing polymer dispersants for pigments is 

reduced by increasing the distance between the firing resistor 
(
10
) and the nozzle (
12
). This may be done by 
offsetting the resistor with respect to the nozzle, increasing 

the thickness of the orifice plate (
14
), increasing 
the thickness of the barrier layer (
18
) which defines 
the firing chamber (
20
) and supports the nozzle plate, or 
recessing the resistor deeper into the substrate (
16
) on 
which it is supported. Any or all of the foregoing may be 

implemented to reduce spray. A combination of thicker top 
plates and offsetting the nozzle relative to the resistor 

is particularly efficacious in reducing spray.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thermal ink-jet pens 
employed in thermal ink-jet printers, and, more particularly, 
to improving the performance of such pens employing an 
ink which includes a polymer to aid in dispersion of a pigment 
colorant. In the art of thermal ink-jet printing, it is known to 
provide a plurality of electrically resistive elements on 
a common substrate for the purpose of heating a corresponding 
plurality of ink volumes contained in adjacent ink reservoirs 
leading to the ink ejection and printing process. 
Using such an arrangement, the adjacent ink reservoirs are 
typically provided as cavities, or firing chambers, in a 
barrier layer attached to the substrate for properly isolating 
mechanical energy to predefined volumes of ink. The 
mechanical energy results from the conversion of electrical 
energy supplied to the resistive elements which creates a 
rapidly expanding vapor bubble in the ink above the resistive 
elements. Also, a plurality of ink ejection orifices 
are provided above these cavities in a nozzle plate and 
provide exit paths for ink during the printing process. In the operation of thermal ink-jet printheads, it is 
necessary to provide a flow of ink to the thermal, or resistive,  
 
element causing ink drop ejection. This has been 
accomplished by manufacturing ink fill channels, or slots, 
in the substrate, ink barrier, or nozzle plate. U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,438,191, 4,500,895, 4,528,577, and 4,578,687, 
all assigned to the same assignee as the present application, 
disclose examples of such thermal ink-jet printheads, 
which have been designed for water-based inks. Water-based inks commonly employ one or more water-soluble 
dyes as the colorant. The colorant is a dye molecule 
that is dissolved in water. Such inks typically include 
the dye, water, at least one co-solvent (an organic 
water-miscible solvent, such as diethylene glycol), and 
minor amounts of other substances, such as biocides. Recent ink formulations have been developed, which 
contain pigments as colorants instead of water-soluble 
dyes. It is imperative to maintain these pigments in a 
dispersed form, because the pigments are particles, and 
would otherwise tend to settle with time. The particles 
are held in dispersion by polymers called polymer dispersants. 
These polymer dispersants have functional groups; 
one functionality on the polymer is hydrophobic and associates 
with the pigment, while another functionality on the 
polymer is hydrophilic and associates with water. The polymer 
is
