 ELECTROCHEMICAL CELL CONTRACTUAL ORIGIN OF THE INVENTIONThe United States Government has rights in this invention pursuant to Contract No. -31-109-ENG-38 between the U.S. Department of Energy and The University of Chicago representing Argonne National Laboratory.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis application is a continuation-in-part application of U.S. patent application serial no. 830,719, filed February 4, 1992, which was a continuation-in-part application of application serial no. 774,204, filed October 10, 1991.This invention relates to an electrochemical cell and to methods of fabricating the cell and improving its capacity and/or power and capability of operating at low temperatures. The invention also relates to a new positive electrode or cathode during discharge for electrochemical cells and method of fabricating same, and more particularly, relates to electrochemical cells and positive electrodes for metal chloride batteries having lower internal impedance and greater discharge capacity with a higher specific energy and power.According to the invention, an electrochemical cell comprises an alkali metal, and preferably, a sodium negative electrode or anode during discharge which is molten at operating temperatures of the cell, an alkali and preferably, a Na+ ion conducting solid electrolyte/separator, a molten salt liquid electrolyte in the positive electrode compartment which is compatible with the positive electrode, and which is also at least partially molten at the operating temperature of the cell, and a positive electrode which is impregnated by the liquid electrolyte and which comprises, as the electroche ically active positive electrode substance of the cell, a transition metal chloride which preferably is selected from the group consisting or iron chloride, nickel chloride, chromium chloride, cobalt chloride and manganese chloride or mixtures thereof. Since the cell with a Na electrode has received the major development effort, a shorthand method of referring to these cells is (Na/MCl2) battery or electrochemical cell, wherein M is one of the transition metalsSUBSTITUTE SHEET
