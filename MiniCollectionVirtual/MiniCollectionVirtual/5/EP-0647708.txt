<ABSTRACT>
The process comprises introducing a starter amt. of brewer's yeast as a suspension into an assimilator tank(1) with leads to introduce nutrient soln.. The nutrient soln. is enriched with dissolved oxygen in the vicinity of the leads. The medium is maintained at a set temp. until a set population density is reached, then the suspension is partly or completely removed from the assimilation tank and transferred to a fermentation tank. The extract content of the suspension and the oxygen content are measured (at 43, 45) constantly. Fixed limits are set for different programs.
