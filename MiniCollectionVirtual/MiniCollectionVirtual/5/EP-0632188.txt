<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an exhaust emission control device for a 
diesel engine, which has a filter (5) disposed in an 

exhaust gas passage (2) for collecting particulates 
contained in exhaust gas. An electric heater (6) and an 

electric motor (M) accommodated in an air pump (9) are 
connected to and actuated by a battery (11). When the 

filter collects a predetermined amount or more of the 
particulates, the heater and pump are actuated to burn the 

particulates to regenerate the filter. The heater and 
motor are driven by an electric duty signal based on the 

difference between a value of actual power, supplied to the 
heater and motor before burning the particulates, and a 

predetermined target power value for burning the 
particulates. A detecting device (15, 16, 17, 18-21) 

detecting the actual power value is electrically connected 
to both ends of the heater and motor and battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exhaust emission 
control device for a diesel engine. An exhaust emission control device has a filter disposed in 
an exhaust gas passage in a diesel engine to collect 
harmful particulates contained in the exhaust gas. This 
exhaust emission control device is disclosed in Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 4-259620. This device 
has an electric heater connected to an end of the filter. 
When activated, the heater burns the particulates collected 
by the filter to thereby regenerate the filter. At the 
time of the filter regeneration, the voltage of a battery 
as a power source of the heater is detected. A duty cycle 
of power to be supplied to the heater is determined 
according to this detected voltage and a predetermined 
heater voltage. Based on the duty cycle, the time for 
supplying the battery power to the heater is controlled and 
the steady power is supplied to the heater. Similar control is performed on an electric air pump which  
 
supplies the secondary air to the filter. Since the current passing through a harness, which connects 
the battery to the heater, causes a voltage drop due to the 
internal resistance, the value of the voltage detected as 
above does not accurately represent the voltage of the 
heater. This voltage drop is a factor when the computation 
of the duty cycle is performed, thus lowering the control 
precision. As a result, the power of the heater deviates 
from the target value. Therefore, the particulates 
collected by the filter are burned incompletely, resulting 
in insufficient regeneration of the filter. A similar problem occurs in the electric air pump for 
supplying the secondary air to the filter. Consequently, 
the secondary air needed to burn the particulates is not 
sufficiently supplied to the heater, deteriorating the 
filter regeneration. Therefore, efficiency of the control device decreases over 
a long use. It is therefore a primary object of the present invention 
to provide an exhaust emission control device for a diesel 
engine, which can effectively filter the exhaust gas even  
 
over a long use. It is another object of the present invention to provide an 
exhaust emission control device, which has excellent filter 
regeneration and can control electric devices, such as an 
electric heater and electric air pump, at a high precision. To achieve the above objects, there is provided an exhaust 
emission control device for a diesel engine, which includes 
a filter disposed in an exhaust gas passage for
