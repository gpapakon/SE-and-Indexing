<ABSTRACT>
Variable-gain amplifier stages, such as may be used in a television receiver intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifier, each comprise a pair of transistors connected as an emitter-coupled differential amplifier with resistive collector loads. An electrically controlled conductance is connected between the collector electrodes of the transistors, to shunt the resistive collector loads in controllable amount to set the voltage gain of the stage. The electrically controlled conductance in each variable-gain amplifier stage is constructed so as not to change the DC operating conditions of the emitter-coupled differential amplifier and its resistive collector loads with variation in the conductance of the electrically controlled conductance. Front end portions of television receivers or video tape recorders are described each of which uses separate intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifiers for the FM sound carrier and vestigial AM picture carrier. In each front end the two IF amplifiers comprise matched cascade connections of the variable-gain amplifiers with tracking automatic gain control (AGC). The AGC signals are generated by an AGC detector supplied composite video signal from a video detector, which video detector responds to amplified IF signal supplied by the IF amplifier for the vestigial-AM picture carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
variable- or controllable-gain amplifiers and more
specifically, but not exclusively, to composite signal
intermediate frequency (IF) amplifiers, such as are
typically utilized in television (TV) receivers and video
cassette recorders (VCR's), also referred to as "PIX IF
amplifiers".In television receivers a down-conversion is carried
out by heterodyning the incoming radio-frequency (RF)
signals of different transmission channels with the
oscillations of a tunable-frequency oscillator, thereby to
generate lower-in-frequency radio-frequency signals within
an intermediate-frequency (IF) band which is selected and
amplified in an intermediate-frequency (IF) amplifier. An
intermediate-frequency amplifier for the video portion of
a television signal is commonly termed the "PIX IF
amplifier". An intermediate-frequency amplifier for the
sound portion of a television signal may be separate from
the PIX IF amplifier or, alternatively, may include the PIX
IF amplifier as is the case in TV sets of the intercarrier
sound type. A PIX IF amplifier is typically required to
handle signals ranging from about 50 microvolts to about
100 millivolts RMS. This represents a dynamic range of 
about 66 dB.Within this specification the term "RF signal" shall
be used in reference to signals at points in a television
receiver before the down-conversion, or first detection;
and the term "IF signal" shall be used in reference to
signals at points in a television receiver after the down-conversion,
or first detection, and before video detection,
or second detection. In the claims following this
specification, however, the term "RF signal" shall be used
in reference to signals at all these points in a television
receiver; and the term RF amplifier is to be construed as
comprising IF amplifiers as well as other types of RF
amplifier.In providing an automatic gain control (AGC) function,
it is desirable that certain operating conditions be met
for each amplifier stage or device. Thus, the input signal
level should exceed the internal noise by a predetermined
factor, and the input signal level should not overload the
device and thereby cause signal distortion and a bias
shift. Furthermore, the AGC control signal should not
itself cause undesirable bias shifts and thereby cause
devices to be shifted from their intended operating points.
E. g., the operating points for amplifiers and mixers are
chosen to provide for low distortion in their output
signals, and the operating points for mixers and
