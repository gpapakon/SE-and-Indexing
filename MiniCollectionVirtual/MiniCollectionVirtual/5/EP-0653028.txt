<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to temperature control 
devices, and in particular to automotive heating, 
ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) temperature 
control devices. Traditional heater cable controls operate as a 
linkage between the control panel and the vent door. In 
such a device, the cable must be able to withstand 
tensile and compressive loads because the cable is being 
both pulled and pushed to operate the vent door. The 
compressive loads require that the cable be somewhat 
rigid which, in turn, limits the radius of the bends 
which the cable can undergo during installation 
procedures, as well as in the final cable positioning. A 
further disadvantage of these traditional temperature 
control devices is that they often require adjustments in 
the length of the cable after installation into the 
vehicle. U.S. Patent No. 5,025,711 discloses an integrated 
temperature and mode selector for a vehicle ventilation 
system which can be operated by a single actuator. This 
device discloses a rotatable shaft coupled to two doors 
for simultaneous rotation with the shaft. The first door 
determines the temperature of the air flow, and the 
second door determines the mode of operation, i.e., a 
heating, cooling or defogger mode. Prior art document DE-A-3 838 018 shows a device 
for transferring motion in a venting system in a vehicle. 
The device comprises a control pulley, a vent pulley and 
a flexible cable connecting the pulleys in a loop like 
manner. The device operates in such a way that only 
drawing forces are exerted on a particular section of the 
cable when motion is to be transferred between the 
pulleys. The cable is furthermore urged by a permanent 
drawing force by means of a bias spring which is situated 
on the vent pulley and connects to one end of the cable. This document forms the preamble of claim 1. Prior art document DE-C-4 002 619 shows a similar 
device, wherein one of the pulleys comprises a bevelled 
gear. Prior art document US-A-5 127 280 shows another 
gear arrangement in connection with a control assembly 
for a vent control in a vehicle. It is a common object of the above prior art 
devices to minimize hysteresis and play in vent control 
devices such that an accurate control can be obtained 
providing the user with a "direct feel", although the 
actual device, i.e. the vent pulley, which is to be 
controlled, is placed a distance away from the dash board 
in which the control actuator or control pulley is 
mounted, and the path of transmission might be relatively
