polymeric binder, and wherein the dye layer also 

contains a stabilizer comprising a monomeric or 
oligomeric organic material having a glass transition 

temperature of greater than about 60°C., the 
stabilizer:

different compounds, each having at least two 

linking components joining one multivalent 
organic nucleus with at least two organic 

nuclei, wherein at least one of the 
multivalent organic nucleus and the organic 

nuclei is a multicyclic aromatic nucleus; or

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of certain 
monomeric glass stabilizers in dye-donor elements for 
thermal dye transfer systems. In recent years, thermal transfer systems 
have been developed to obtain prints from pictures 
which have been generated electronically from a color 
video camera. According to one way of obtaining such 
prints, an electronic picture is first subjected to 
color separation by color filters. The respective 
color-separated images are then converted into 
electrical signals. These signals are then operated on 
to produce cyan, magenta and yellow electrical signals. 
These signals are then transmitted to a thermal 
printer. To obtain the print, a cyan, magenta or 
yellow dye-donor element is placed face-to-face with a 
dye-receiving element. The two are then inserted 
between a thermal printing head and a platen roller. A 
line-type thermal printing head is used to apply heat 
from the back of the dye-donor sheet. The thermal 
printing head has many heating elements and is heated 
up sequentially in response to the cyan, magenta or 
yellow signal. The process is then repeated for the 
other two colors. A color hard copy is thus obtained 
which corresponds to the original picture viewed on a 
screen. Further details of this process and an 
apparatus for carrying it out are contained in U.S. 
patent 4,621,271. An important requirement for any thermal dye-donor 
element is to maintain performance over its 
useful lifetime without degradation in the quality of 
the image. The dye layer of a dye-donor element for 
resistive head thermal dye transfer generally comprises 
a polymeric binder and diffusible dyes. The percentage 
of dye in the layer is typically quite high, in the 
range of 20 to 80 %. The dye is usually dissolved in  
 
the binder or phase-separated into small domains. 
During keeping of the donor, the temperature and 
humidity may be elevated and the dye layer is in 
contact with a slipping layer coated on the back side 
of the donor element when it is wound up in spool form. 
The slipping layer may contain mobile lubricating oils 
or materials which can act as plasticizers or solvents 
for the dye layer. This enables the dye to become 
mobile, allowing changes to occur in the layer 
including further phase separation, migration of the 
dye to the surface, and even crystallization of the 
dye. Dye may also transfer to the slipping layer. 
These changes generally result in sensitometric 
variations, nonuniform printing due to light or dark 
spots and dye smearing from a
