<ABSTRACT>
Methods and apparatus for providing substantially complete correction of thermally-induced aberrations of the gain medium in an end-pumped laser system with at least one aspheric surface that is positioned within the optical cavity of the laser system. The at least one aspheric surface is shaped to substantially cancel all of the thermally-induced aberration of the gain medium at the normal power level of the laser system.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Correction of Thermallv-lnduced Aberration in End-Pumped Soliri-State LasersField of the InventionThe present invention is directed to high-power, high efficiency end-pumped solid-state lasers, and more specifically to methods and apparatus for correction of thermally-induced aberrations in such lasers to achieve high efficiency and beam quality.Background of the Invention Fundamental inefficiencies in the lasing process of any laser system result in some fraction of the pump power being left behind as waste heat in the lasing medium. This heat causes a change in the index of refraction and thermal expansion of the lasing medium. The wavefront of the extraction beam is distorted if it is passed through a lasing medium with non-uniform temperature distribution. The specific parameters of the pump, extraction, cooling and gain medium geometry determine the nature of such wavefront distortion.Thermally-induced distortion generated in side-pumped lasers can be substantially eliminated with simple focus correction. However, the non-uniform heat distribution in end- pumped lasers is inherently non-uniform, so that the correction of thermally-induced distortion is more complex than simple focus correction. In this case, the distortion may be represented by a combination of focus and higher-order spherical aberrations.An optical wavefront that is a surface of revolution can be defined as the sum of its oscillating sphere plus higher order terms by means of the following relationship, taking the z-axis as the axis of revolution,c sZ " 1 + ( 1 - C2 s2) 1 2 + B1 s4 + B2 S6 + B3 S8 + 

where c - 1 /radius of curvature and s =* x2 + y2. Also, Bi B2 and B3 are the aspheric deformation constants. The Bj constants represent the higher-order spherical aberrations while the first term in this wavefront expansion relationship represents the focus. In a conventional resonator, that is, one with a combination of spherical and flat surfaces, only the first term in the wavefront distortion expansion can be corrected.The spherical aberrations reduce the output beam quality as well as the laser efficiency. Laser efficiency is reduced because the distortion diffracts power out of the fundamental mode volume of the laser cavity, thereby causing significant round-trip losses. The degree to which the efficiency is reduced depends on the gain, as well as the magnitude and distribution of the aberration. In low gain continuous-wave (CW) lasers, the aberrations can dominate laser performance above output powers of a few
