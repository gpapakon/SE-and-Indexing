<ABSTRACT>
In a fuel valve and ignitor control system the pull-in current for a fuel 
valve (16) operating on rectified alternating current is supplied through a normally open 

contact (r21) of a relay (R2) which is connected in series with a normally open contact 
(r11) of another relay (R1) and an intermittently operating hot surface ignitor (20). A 

normally closed contact (r12) of the other relay (R1) is connected in series with the 
ignitor (20) and the fuel valve (16) through a holding resistor (25), whereby actuation of 

the other relay (R1) provides unrectified alternating current to the ignitor (20) and 
actuates the first mentioned relay (R2) to provide pull-in current to the fuel valve (16). 

Deactivation of the other relay (R1) provides a holding current to the fuel valve (16) via 
the ignitor (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a control apparatus for fuel burners 
having an intermittent pilot and a hot surface ignitor, and more particularly to an 
arrangement of such apparatus in which energization of a fuel valve is conditioned on 
flow of electric current through the ignitor. For reasons set forth in detail in a number of prior references, including U.S. 
Patents 5,020,988, 5,035,607 and 5,133,656, a gas burner system employing an 
intermittently operating pilot ignited by a hot surface ignitor has become a preferred 
burner system arrangement. One safety concern with such an arrangement is that fuel 
gas must not be supplied to the burner if the ignitor is not operating properly. A variety 
of approaches have been taken to addressing this concern. For example, in the burner 
control system of U.S. Patent 5,020,988, fuel valve energization is controlled by a 
circuit, including a sequencer which locks out energization to a pilot valve, and, in turn, 
prevents energization of a main valve where attempts to light a pilot burner have been 
unsuccessful. U.S. Patent 5,035,607 discloses a burner control system in which ignitor 
voltage and/or current are monitored to indicate operating state of the ignitor, and used 
to prevent energization of the fuel valve in the event proper ignitor operation is not 
indicated. In both of the previously described arrangements, safety is ensured by sensing a 
condition related to proper ignitor operation, and utilizing the sensed condition to 
control a fuel valve operator. Each of these arrangements utilizes a flame sensor for 
detecting presence of a pilot flame, which condition implies proper operation of the 
ignitor. Detection of a pilot flame also causes power to be cut to the ignitor to prolong 
ignitor life, and causes opening of a main fuel valve. The arrangement of U.S. Patent 
5,035,607 also implies proper operation of the ignitor from sensed voltage and current 
conditions at the ignitor, and does not allow fuel to be supplied to the pilot or main 
burners in the absence of predetermined voltage and/or current conditions, which 
provides additional safety. A more direct and simple arrangement for preventing supply of fuel to a burner if 
the ignitor is not operating properly, is to connect the fuel valve solenoid and ignitor in 
series so that the same current energizes both the ignitor and fuel valve. Thus, any 
condition which interferes with adequate current through the ignitor, such as the ignitor 
burning open, also prevents operation
