<ABSTRACT>
In prior art throttle devices the inlet channels are cylindrically formed in the pivoting region of throttle components or there are metering or proportioning venturis which do not affect the air flow at small angles of aperture of the throttle component in the best possible way. The feature of the novel throttle device is its extremely accurately matched metering or proportioning venturis (16, 17) in the region of small angles of aperture of the throttle valve (2) in the intake channel (5) which is achieved by the process of moving a rotating material-removing component (20) with its centre (M) along precalculated paths (B) in the intake channel (5) axially with a radial shift. This process makes it possible to produce the widest variety of outlines of the metering or proportioning venturis (16, 17) in order to achieve desired air-throughput-angle of aperture characteristics. The throttle device is usually used in internal combustion engines preferably fitted to motor vehicles.

Method of manufacturing metering or apportioning 
walls (16, 17) in an induction duct (5) of a 

throttle appliance for an internal combustion engine 
with a throttle butterfly shaft (3) rotatably supported 

and protruding transversely through the induction duct 
(5) and a throttle butterfly (2) fastened to the 

throttle butterfly shaft in the induction duct (5), the 
induction duct (5) having a cylindrical region (7) with 

a longitudinal axis (9), in which cylindrical region 
(7) is completely located, in the closed position, the 

throttle butterfly (2) which is embodied in oval shape, 
and the metering or apportioning walls following 

upstream and downstream of the cylindrical region (7), 
characterized in that the contours of the metering or 

apportioning walls (16, 17) are generated by a 
procedure in which, first of all, contours (16', 17'), 

of the metering or apportioning walls (16, 17), which 
are matched to the requirements of the internal 

combustion engine are specified in a plane extending at 
right angles to the throttle butterfly shaft (3) and 

through a longitudinal axis (9) of the induction duct 
(5); hypothetical cutting planes at right angles to the 

longitudinal axis (9) are subsequently generated at 
almost infinitely small axial distances (b); a radial 

distance (c) is subsequently subtracted from the 
intersection point of each of these cutting planes with 

the contours (16', 17') of the metering or apportioning 
walls (16, 17) in the direction towards the 

longitudinal axis (9), which radial distance (c), 
starting from the contours (16', 17') of the metering  

 
or apportioning walls (16, 17), ends in each case in a 

point, each point representing the respective centre 
(M) of a chip-cutting element (20) about which the 

rotation of the element (20) takes place; the centres 
(M) determined in this manner in the individual cutting 

planes with the axial distances (b) give a locus (B); 
and finally, in order to generate the stepless, three-dimensional 

contours of the metering or apportioning 
walls (16, 17), the chip-cutting element (20) is 

displaced, while rotating, in the axial and radial 
direction along a locus (B) of the centre points (M). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the contours of the metering or apportioning walls 

(16, 17) are produced by a constant size chip-cutting 
element (20) and, therefore, the contours of the metering 

or apportioning walls (16, 17) represent contours 
parallel to the locus (B) of the centres (M) of the 

chip-cutting element (20). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the manufacture of the contours of the metering or 

apportioning walls (16, 17) takes place in such a way 
that the radial distance (c) between the centre (M) of 

rotation and the metering or apportioning walls (16, 
17) is variable so that the locus (B) of the centres 

(M) and the contours of the metering or apportioning 
walls (16, 17) do not extend parallel to one another.
