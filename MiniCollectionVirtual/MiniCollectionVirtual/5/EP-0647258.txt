<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention a luminescent article is provided which luminescent article comprises a self-supporting or supported layer of phosphor particles dispersed in a binding medium and a protective coating thereover characterised in that the binding medium comprises one or more rubbery and/or elastomeric polymers, in that the ratio by volume of pigment to binding medium is at least 70:30 and at most 92:8 and the packing ratio is less than 67 %. By said rubbery and/or elastomeric polymers the phosphor layer has improved elasticity of the screen, high protection against mechanical damage and thus high ease of manipulation and high pigment to binder ratio. Moreover no compression manipulation is necessary to get a thinner coated phosphor layer with reduced voids, and nevertheless a better image quality, i.a. sharpness, is obtained. One or more antioxidants may be present.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LUMINESCENT ARTICLE WITH HIGH PIGMENT TO BINDER RATIO AND MANUFACTURE THEREOFDESCRIPTION1. Field of the invention.The present invention relates to radiation—sensitive luminescent articles comprising a coated layer of phosphor particles in a binder and to a method to manufacture the said articles.2. Background of the inventionIn radiography the interior of objects is reproduced by means of penetrating radiation which is high energy radiation belonging to the class of X-rays, γ-rays and high energy elementary particle radiation, e.g. β-rays, electron beam or neutron radiation. For the conversion of penetrating radiation into visible light and/or ultraviolet radiation luminescent substances are used called phosphors.In a conventional radiographic system an X-ray radiograph is obtained by X-rays transmitted imagewise through an object and converted into light of corresponding intensity in a so-called intensifying screen (X-ray conversion screen) wherein phosphor particles absorb the transmitted X-rays and convert them into visible light and/or ultraviolet radiation whereto a photographic film is more sensitive than to the direct impact of the X-rays.In practice the light emitted imagewise by said screen irradiates a contacting photographic silver halide emulsion layer film which after exposure is developed to form therein a silver image in conformity with the X-ray image.For use in common medical radiography the X-ray film comprises a transparant film support double-side coated with a silver halide emulsion layer. During the X-ray irradiation said film is arranged in a cassette between two X-ray conversion screens each of them making contact with their corresponding silver halide emulsion layer.Single side coated silver halide emulsion films combined in contact with only one screen are often used in autoradiography, in 

applications where improved image definition is of great importance e.g. in mammography and in particular fields of non—destructive testing (NDT) known as industrial radiography. An autoradiograph is a photographic record formed through the intermediary of penetrating radiation emitted by radioactive material contained in an object, e.g. microtome cut for biochemical research.Phosphors suitable for use in the conventional radiographic system must have a high prompt emission on X-ray irradiation and low after-glow in favour of image-sharpness.More recently an X-ray recording system has been developed wherein photostimulable storage phosphors are used that in addition to their immediate
