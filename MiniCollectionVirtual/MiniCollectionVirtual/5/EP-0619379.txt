<ABSTRACT>
A functionally gradient material disclosed is the one obtained by cast-forming slurry containing therein groups of particles 
of a plurality of types, which are different in specific gravity and sintering the cast slurry, said groups of particles of the plurality 

of types containing at least a first group of particles and a second group of particles, said first group of particles being a group of 
non-metallic particles containing one or more groups selected from groups consisting of an oxide, a carbide, a nitride and an acid 

nitride, which have a specific gravity within the range of 5 - 7 and have the largest particle diameter less than the deflocculation 
limit, and said second group of particles being a metallic group of particles having a specific gravity of about 1.5 times that of 

said first group of particles or more and have diameters scattering on both sides of the deflocculation limit. A method of manufacturing 
this functionally gradient material comprises the steps of: providing the slurry containing the above groups of particles 

of the plurality of types and/or single slurries of a plurality of types, respectively; suitably supplying the same to a porous mold; 
and forming a wall forming portion in said porous mold in consideration of the adsorption effect of the porous mold and the deflocculation 

effect in the slurries of various particles, the influence of gravity or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
process for the preparation of a sealing cap for a discharge lamp bulb, using a gradient function material.US 4,602,956 describes composite cermets which are
useful as end closures for metal halide discharge lamps
and which have a central core of a first cermet
composition and one or more surrounding layers of
different cermet compositions. The composite cermets
are formed by a multi-step pressing operation, followed
by sintering.US 4,822,312 describes combination sealing discs
and electrodes for discharge lamps. The electrodes
comprise layers of different composition and are formed
by pressing and then sintering layers of powders of
different composition.DE-A 2032277 describes a sealing structure for a
discharge lamp bulb in which an electrode core is
surrounded by rings of material of varying coefficient
of thermal expansion.The compositions and hence the characteristics of
the prior art sealing caps for discharge lamp bulbs vary
in a stepwise manner. This can give rise to problems
with peeling of the different layers and consequent
deterioration of the seal under thermal stress.It has heretofore been known to use a gradient
function material as a heat resistant material in locations
where the difference between inner and outer temperatures is
very large, e.g., as a surface layer material for a space
shuttle.Conventional gradient function materials have been
produced by either making, laminating, pressing, and thereafter
firing a number of green sheets which have slightly
different compositions, or an evaporation process such as CVD
or the like.However, a gradient function material which is produced
by laminating green sheets does not have a completely
continuous range of compositions, but has compositions varying
stepwise transversely thereacross. Therefore, such a
gradient function material fails to fully perform the desired
function thereof.A gradient function material which is manufactured
by an evaporation process such as CVD or the like can have a
completely continuous range of compositions. However, since  
the thickness of a film that can be deposited in one evaporation
process is highly small, it is very difficult from the
standpoint of cost and technology to obtain a gradient function
material having a required thickness.DE 2 517 931 discloses a process for the preparation of a functionally
graded material with a continually changing composition from two
or more particulate substances of different specific weights.There have been proposed methods of
