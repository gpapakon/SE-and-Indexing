<ABSTRACT>
A developer circulating method in the flexographic plate making step, capable of preventing a dissolved chemical substance 
from adversely affecting a human body, having a high safety, capable of preventing an increase in the viscosity of the liquid, 

the deposition of a dissolved substance on an apparatus and a decrease in the longevity of the apparatus, capable of reducing 
the recovery time, and having high operability, operation efficiency and treatment efficiency; and an apparatus for practicing 

this method. The solid in a liquid containing a water-dispersed resin component of a flexographic plate material (3, 42) in a 
developer is coagulated with a coagulant, and the coagulated solid-containing liquid is subjected to solid-liquid separation to discharge 

the solid and reuse the liquid as a developer. In addition to the coagulation of the solid, pH regulation may be carried out. 
Also, pH regulation may be carried out after the developer has been subjected to solid-liquid separation, without carrying out the 

coagulation of the solid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a developer-circulating 
method and an apparatus for carrying out the 
method in manufacturing a printing plate made of photosensitive 
resin and in particular, a flexographic printing plate 
of water-development type, with water-dispersion type resin 
grains which have been eluted in developer (water) being 
effectively removed and developer circulated. As developer to be used in making the flexographic 
printing plate, chlorine-series solvent such as 1, 1, 1-trichloroethane 
is being replaced by aqueous solvent which is 
safe and inexpensive. Ink for use in printing, oiliness ink 
is more dominant over aqueous ink. But the function of a 
compound composing the flexographic printing plate that the 
component is dissolved in water during development is a 
reciprocal event of water-proof ink. In order to solve this 
reciprocity law, it is likely that a compound of conventional 
water-soluble type is being replaced by a compound of water-dispersion 
type.  However, in the compound of the water-dispersion 
type, grains are formed in an eluate in development. As a 
result, defective phenomena that the grains adhere to a 
developing device and the printing plate occur during 
development. Thus, it is necessary to solve the defective 
phenomena by discharging resin grains from a developer-circulating 
system and taking measures of dissolving the resin 
grains in the eluate. As examples of performing such a treatment, there 
is disclosed in USP4,239,368, an apparatus for developing a 
printing plate comprising a device for separating solid 
content from liquid by circulating resin grains by a pump and 
filtering them with a cartridge filter in order to prevent a 
printing plate and the interior of the developing apparatus 
from being polluted by tailings of eluted resin. There is disclosed in EP430,233A an apparatus, 
similar to the art disclosed in USP4,239,368, for flocculating 
and precipitating dispersed resin (tailings) by transferring 
developer to a precipitation tank and allowing it to stand 
overnight, and then, separating solid content from liquid by 
means of a filter. Conventional methods for removing resin tailings 
formed in developer is classified into the following two 
methods. According to a first method, in order to prevent  
 
grains from being deposited as tailings, grains are stably 
dispersed without depositing as tailings by adding complexing 
agent (Examined Japanese Patent Publication No. 4-14342), 
carrying out the pH adjustment of the grains by
