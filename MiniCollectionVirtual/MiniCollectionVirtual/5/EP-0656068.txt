<DESCRIPTION>
Hybridisation methods are widely utilised in testing for the
presence of particular nucleic acid sequences, identifying
and/or quantifying such sequences.Various improvements and modifications have been introduced,
to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the reaction.
For example, a number of recently developed in vitro nucleic
acid amplification methods have greatly increased the
sensitivity of detection. These methods include: ligase
chain reaction (LCR), nucleic acid sequence based
amplification (NASBA), QÎ² replicase based methods, strand
displacement amplification (SDA) and notably polymerase chain
reaction (PCR).In a recent development, two separate PCR amplifications have
been used to both amplify and label the target nucleic acid
sequence. The labelled sequence is then immobilised on a
solid phase carrier, and testing is carried out using a
reagent specific to the label. (See D J Kemp et al,
"Colorimetric detection of specific DNA segments amplified by
polymerase chain reactions", Proc Natl Acad Sci USA86, pp
2423-2427, 1989.)However, in prior art methods, including that of Kemp et al,
solution amplified nucleic acids have been detected in a
second vessel by capture of hybridisation to solid phase
capture reagents (two vessel assays).Solid phase techniques have been used in relation to
synthesis procedures (e.g. chemical synthesis of amino acid
and nucleic acid sequences) and assay procedures (as in the
final step of the procedure of Kemp et al, see above). However, it has not hitherto been possible to conduct an in
solution amplification process for nucleic acid sequences,
and identification/quantification procedures, in the same
reaction vessel.JP-A-03-262499 relates to a detection method for a test polynucleotide.
Amplification of the test polynucleotide and detection
are carried out in a capillary vessel. In a first step,
the reaction vessel is charged with a reaction mixture of the
test polynucleotide, two primers, at least one of which is radioactively
labeled, DNA polymerase, binding substance of sedimenting
carrier and a test polynucleotide probe. In a second
step, the test polynucleotide is then amplified using the PCR-method.
Finally, the test polynucleotide bound to binding substance
of sedimenting carrier and test polynucleotide probe and
sedimenting carrier is detected by measuring the distribution
between the radioactivities in the reaction solution and the
sedimenting carrier.
The test polynucleotide probe is no solid phase probe. Further,
it is not required that the test
