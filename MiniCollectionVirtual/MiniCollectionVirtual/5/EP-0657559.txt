<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum alloy substrate for an electrolytically 
grainable lithographic printing plate, consisting of an 

aluminum alloy cold-rolled sheet, produced by a 
continuous casting and rolling process, comprising 0.20 

to 0.80 wt% of Fe with the balance consisting of 
aluminum, grain refining elements, and unavoidable 

impurities including 0.3 wt% or less of Si and 0.05 wt% 
or less of Cu, grains in a surface layer portion having a 

width of not more than 150 µm in a direction parallel to 
the sheet surface and normal to the direction of cold 

rolling and a length, in a direction parallel to the 
direction of cold rolling, of not more than 8 times the 

width.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum 
alloy substrate for an electrolytically grainable 
lithographic printing plate having a good electrolytic 
graining property, particularly excellent in uniformity 
of appearance after electrolytic graining. Conventional aluminum alloy substrates for a 
support for an electrolytically grainable lithographic 
printing plate are generally provided in the form of an 
about 0.1 to 0.5 mm thick cold-rolled sheet made of an 
aluminum alloy such as JIS A1050, A1100, A3003, or the 
like. Such aluminum alloy cold-rolled sheets are 
generally produced by machining the surface of a 
semicontinuous-cast (DC) slab, homogenization heat-treating 
the slab when necessary, heating the slab to a 
selected temperature, hot-rolling the heated slab to a 
hot-rolled strip, cold-rolling the hot-rolled strip with 
an intermediate annealing between the cold rolling 
passes, and final cold rolling the strip to a cold-rolled 
sheet. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 3-79798 discloses a process for producing an aluminum 
alloy support for an electrolytically grainable 
lithographic printing plate, in which an aluminum alloy 
melt is continuously cast and rolled to form a strip coil 
which is then subjected to cold rolling, heat treatment, 
and straightening. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 5-156414 discloses a process for producing an 
aluminum alloy support for an electrolytically grainable  
 
lithographic printing plate, which comprises carrying out 
twin-roll continuous casting and rolling and then hot 
rolling to prepare a strip coil having a thickness of 4 
to 30 mm which is then cold-rolled, with heat treatment 
at a temperature of 400°C or above being carried out in 
the course of the cold rolling when the thickness of the 
rolled sheet has reached 1 mm, and further cold-rolled. 
It further discloses a process for producing an aluminum 
alloy support for an electrolytically grainable 
lithographic printing plate, which comprises carrying out 
twin-roll continuous casting and rolling and then hot 
rolling to prepare a strip coil having a thickness of 4 
to 30 mm which is then heat-treated at a temperature of 
300°C or above and cold-rolled with heat treatment at a 
temperature of 300°C or above being again carried out in 
the course of the cold rolling. The above conventional processes are 
disadvantageous in that the production steps are 
complicated and involve time consuming treatment, 
inevitably increasing costs. Further, in the above

A process for producing an aluminum alloy substrate 
for an electrolytically grainable lithographic printing 

plate, said process comprising the steps of: 

preparing a melt of an alluminum alloy consisting 
of 0.20 to 0.80 wt% of Fe with the balance consisting of 

aluminum, grain refining elements, and unavoidable impurities 
including 0.3 wt% or less of Si and 0.05 wt% or less of Cu; 
continuously casting and rolling. said melt to form 
a strip having a thickness of 20 mm or less; 
cold-rolling the strip with heat treatment being 
carried out at least once in the course of cold-rolling by 

rapid heating sufficient to prevent local grain growth during 
heating; 
thereby regulating the dimension and shape of 
grains in the cold-rolled sheet in its surface layer portion 

from the surface of the sheet to at least about 30 µm from 
its surface, so that the width in a direction parallel to the 

sheet surface and normal to the direction of cold-rolling is 
not more than 150 µm and the length in a direction parallel 

to the direction of cold-rolling is not more than 8 times 
said width. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein said 
rapid heating is carried out at a temperature rise rate of 

not less than 1°C/sec. 
The process according to claims 1 or 2, wherein 
said heat treatment by rapid heating is carried out in the 

temperature range of from 440 to 600°C.  
 
The process according to any one of the claims 1 to 
3, wherein the total rolling ratio before said rapid heating 

is not less than 50%. 
The process according to any one of the claims 1-4, 
wherein the total rolling ratio after the final heat 

treatment in said heat treatment is not more than 80%. 
The use of the aluminum alloy substrate produced in 
a process according to any one of the claims 1 to 5 in a 

lithographic printing plate for imparting good electrolytic 
graining property and excellent uniformity of appearance 

after electrolytic graining.
