<ABSTRACT>
An active hand controller system includes a moment cell (121) for generating a 
signal representative of the force or torque applied to the stick (1) of the hand controller 

by a user. The moment cell (121) has an internal center of rotation and distributed 
masses (40a, 40b) are used to counterbalance the effect of inertial forces on the stick of 

the hand controller.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to an active hand controller system according to the
preamble of the independent claims.This invention relates generally to a control system of the type wherein manual
control devices such as a control stick are provided which have an electro simulated
variable force versus displacement characteristic, referred to herein as variable rate feel.
Hand controller systems having this electro simulated variable rate feel are commonly
referred to as active hand controllers. Such active hand controllers utilize electric
motors to produce desired hand controller force and position response. These systems
require sensors which can provide accurate and stable information about the position of
the hand grip and the force or torque exerted upon the hand grip by the operator. The
present invention relates specifically to a system of the above mentionned type capable of
providing force information as described in US-A 5 264 768. The present invention
allows such a force sensor to be used in an environment such as an aircraft or spacecraft
where significant acceleration forces may be encountered.FIG. 1 illustrates a passive or spring centered hand controller 12 of the type
found in the prior art including hand grip 14, shaft 16, gimbal 18, and position resolver
20, shaft 22, arm 23 and spring arrangement 24. In the single degree of freedom
arrangement shown, gimbal 18 allows rotational motion of the hand controller 12 about
an axis parallel to shaft 22. It is well known that if hand controller 12 is to be used in an
environment where significant acceleration will be experienced, then a counterweight 26
must be provided. Counter weight 26 is typically a weight attached to gimbal 18 and
sized to statically balance gimbal 18, including hand grip 14 and shaft 16 so that no net
torque about shaft 22 will be generated by longitudinal acceleration.In some active hand controller systems, the counterbalance approach just
described may not be necessary due to the capability of the active feedback system to
resist any unbalanced gimbal force. The elimination of gimbal counterweight 26, where
this is possible, provides a weight savings that is especially advantageous in aircraft 
applications. There is a need, however, to balance inertial forces which the active hand
controller does not inherently balance, for example, where the hand controller has an axis
of rotation displaced from the gimbal axis of rotation, as is the case with the moment cell
described hereinbefore. In the present design concepts for
