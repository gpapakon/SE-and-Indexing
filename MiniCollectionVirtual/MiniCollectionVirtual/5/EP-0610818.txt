<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for the preparation of 
high molecular-weight silicone resins that have 

excellent storage stability in solution form. The 
method comprises the hydrolysis and condensation of a 

disiloxane and an alkyl silicate in an aqueous solution 
which contains at least 30 weight% alcohol and at least 

5 weight% inorganic acid followed by isolation of the 
resin with an organic solvent which is poorly soluble 

in water and which has a dielectric constant of at 
least 4.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for 
the preparation of a silicone resin composed of 
monofunctional siloxane units (M units) and 
tetrafunctional siloxane units (Q units) which has a 
high molecular-weight and an excellent storage 
stability. Silicone resins composed of monofunctional 
(M) and tetrafunctional (Q) siloxane units are used as 
starting materials for pressure-sensitive adhesives, as 
reinforcing components for silicone rubber 
compositions, and as starting materials for 
film-forming materials such as silicone varnishes. 
Methods proposed for the preparation of there resins 
include: (a) cohydrolysis by the addition of water to a 
mixture of alkyl silicate and hydrolyzable 
trialkylsilane (US-A 2,857,356), and (b) dripping alkyl 
silicate into a mixed system of organosilicon 
compound(s) (selected from disiloxanes and hydrolyzable 
triorganosilanes) in aqueous hydrochloric acid solution 
(Japanese Patent Publication [Kokai] 3-60851 
[60,851/1991]). To be useful as a film-forming material, a 
silicone resin should have a high molecular-weight. 
However, when high molecular-weight silicone resin is 
prepared by the methods taught in the above documents 
either the product undergoes gelation or it has a very 
poor storage stability in solution form. The present invention relates to a method for preparing 
a high molecular-weight silicone resin comprising: 
(I) hydrolizing and condensing (A) a disiloxane with 
the general formula [R1 2HSi]2O and (B) an alkyl silicate with 
the general formula Si(OR2)4 in (C) an aqueous solution which 
contains at least 30 weight percent alcohol and at least 5 
weight percent inorganic acid, the percentages of both the 
alcohol and the inorganic acid being based on the total of 
said aqueous solution; wherein R1 is a monovalent hydrocarbon  
 
group and R2 is an alkyl group, the components (A) and (B) 
being used in a proportion such that the moles of component 
(A) / moles of component (B) is in the range of 0.05 to 0.6; 
and (II) isolating the silicone resin product with (D) an 
organic solvent which forms two layers with water and which 
has a dielectric constant of at least 4. The method of the present invention produces 
a high molecular-weight silicone resin that has 
excellent storage stability in solution form. The 
process comprises the hydrolysis and condensation of 
(A) a disiloxane and (B) an alkyl silicate in (C) an 
aqueous solution that contains an alcohol and an 
inorganic acid followed by isolation of the resin with
