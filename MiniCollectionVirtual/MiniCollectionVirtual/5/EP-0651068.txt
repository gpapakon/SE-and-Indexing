<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an amorphous metal wire
having a Large Barkhausen effect, excellent magnetic
properties and high toughness, the amorphous metal wire being
useful as a pulse voltage generating element.It has been well known that amorphous metal materials
having various forms (for example, thin film band, filament,
powder) and various properties can be obtained by quenching
molten metals. In particular, Fe- and Co-based filamentous
quenched amorphous metal wires having a circular cross-section
which are disclosed in JP-A-1-25941 (U.S. Patent No.
4,735,864) and JP-A-1-25932 (U.S. Patent No. 4,781,771), are
known as magnetic materials showing a Large Barkhausen
effect. These materials undergo a rapid magnetic flux change
at a certain applied magnetic field value during
magnetization. (The term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application".) These
amorphous metal wires have been widely used as magnetic
markers and magnetic cores of pulse voltage generating
elements.Further, JP-A-1-25941 discloses an Fe-based amorphous
metal wire having a wire diameter of 100 µm or less and
showing a Large Barkhausen effect that can be obtained by the 
steps of drawing an Fe-based quenched amorphous metal wire,
heating under tension and then quenching.Examples of amorphous metal wires, other than those
described above, include an amorphous metal wire having
excellent fatigue characteristics [see JP-A-58-213857 (U.S.
Patent No. 4,473,401)], an amorphous metal wire having
excellent fatigue characteristics and toughness [see JP-A-60-106949
(U.S. Patent No. 4,584,034)] and an amorphous metal
wire having excellent fatigue characteristics and improved
toughness [see JP-A-63-145742 (U.S. Patent No. 4,806,179)].
These amorphous metal wires are widely employed in industrial
materials, such as various reinforcements, by taking
advantage of the excellent mechanical properties thereof.Attempts are made to develop an amorphous metal wire
useful as a pulse voltage generating element using the above-mentioned
amorphous metal wires by the method proposed in
JP-A-63-24003. However, the use of these amorphous metal
wires for this purpose is disadvantageous because, for
example, they each either have poor magnetic properties or
will break frequently during the cold drawing or heat
treatment step due to insufficient toughness of the amorphous
metal wire.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
amorphous metal wire showing a Large Barkhausen effect and
excellent pulse voltage generating
