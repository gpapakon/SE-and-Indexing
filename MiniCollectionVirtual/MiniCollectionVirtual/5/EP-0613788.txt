<ABSTRACT>
An image receptor sheet for use in a thermal 
transfer method using a thermal transfer material having a 

thermal transfer layer composed mainly of a thermoplastic 
resin, which image receptor sheet comprises a substrate and 

an image receptor layer containing sucrose benzoate, 
exhibits excellent image-receiving performance and adhesion 

to a transferred image and which gives an image transfer 
product excellent in scratch resistance, abrasion resistance 

and outdoor weatherability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image receptor
sheet for use in heat-melting thermal transfor. More
specifically, it relates to an image receptor sheet for use
in thermal transfer, which has the property of receiving
thermal transfer images, patterns, characters, etc. (to be
sometimes simply referred to as image(s) hereinafter), and
which gives an image transfer product excellent in scratch
resistance, abrasion resistance and weatherability.A heat-melting thermal transfer device is
recently widely used in a facsimile machine, a word
processor, a computer terminal printer, and the like since
it has features in that it is noise-free because of its
non-impact system, maintenance-free, less expensive, small
in size and light in weight. A thermal transfer material is
generally produced by forming a heat-melting ink layer
composed mainly of a wax on one surface of a substrate
formed of a thin plastic film such as a polyester film
(e.g., polyethylene terephthalate or polyethylene
naphthalate). An image is transferred as follows. While
the above heat-melting ink layer is in contact with the
surface of an image receptor such as general paper, part of
the heat-melting ink is transferred to the image receptor by
heating the other surface of the substrate, for example, by
means of a thermal head.With recent progress in the automatization of
factories and stores, thermal transfer materials are
increasingly used in labels and barcodes, and
image-recorded sheets (e.g., labels and barcodes) are 
increasingly required to have various resistances such as
scratch resistance and abrasion resistance. For this
purpose, there has been developed a thermal transfer
material having a heat-melting ink layer (transfer layer)
composed mainly of a resin, and various materials such as
coat paper, synthetic paper and a plastic sheet have begun
to be used as image receptors depending upon purposes. When
the thermal transfer material having a heat-melting ink
layer composed mainly of a resin is used, it is difficult to
transfer the heat-melting ink to general paper. The above
heat-melting ink layer can be transferred to synthetic paper
or a plastic sheet, while the adhesion of the heat-melting
ink layer to the synthetic paper or the plastic sheet is
insufficient, and the heat-melting ink layer is easily
peeled off when a Cellophane tape is attached and peeled.As an image receptor which serves to improve the
resistances of an image transfer product, JP-A-63-137892
discloses an image receptor sheet produced by forming a
layer of a
