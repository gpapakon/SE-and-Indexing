<ABSTRACT>
In a method for formation of a mat containing 
different fibre types, a mixture of different 

fibre types is deposited by an air flow to 
form a mat. Fibres are fed at two or more 

successive feeding points (A, B) to the same 
air flow (F). Turbulence is generated in the 

air flow for mixing the fibres together uniformly, 
and the air flow (F) is conveyed to a mat 

formation point (D).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the method presented in the 
ingress of the appended claim 1 for formation of a 
mat containing different fibre types, as well as to 
the apparatus presented in the ingress of the appended 
claim 5 for formation of a mat containing different 
fibre types. In the manufacture of mats from staple fibres, it is 
often necessary to form a mat from a fibre mixture 
containing two or more fibre types in order to provide 
the mat e.g. with optimal physical properties. In 
this case, different fibre types denote either fibres 
of the same material with various lengths or sizes, or 
fibres of different materials, for example mineral 
fibres, glass fibres and synthetic fibres, which can 
be of some polymer, such as polyethylene, polypropylene 
or polyester. A mat of this kind is usually formed in such a way that 
the staple fibre bales used as raw material are broken 
down and the fibres are "opened" in a special opening 
unit to make them as well separated as possible and 
to prevent the formation of fibre bundles. The fibres 
are generally mixed to each other during an opening 
process of this kind. A method is also used in which 
the fibres are mixed to each other before the opening 
or in a carding process after the opening. All these 
methods have the disadvantage that the fibres are not 
mixed evenly to each other and the finished mat product 
is not homogeneous. At the process stages before 
formation of the fibres by means of an air flow onto 
a suitable support to form a mat, the fibres tend to 
remain in bundles or form bundles with fibres that 
are of a type most similar to them. Also the density 
values of the fibres have influence on their settling  
 
at the stage of formation of the mat. This is particularly 
problematic in the case of stiff fibres, 
such as mineral and glass fibres. It is an aim of the invention to present a method for 
overcoming the difficulties mentioned above and for 
mixing two or more fibre types for manufacturing of 
a homogeneous mat product. To attain this aim, the 
method according to the invention is primarily characterized 
by the disclosure in the characterizing part 
of the appended claim 1. By supplying the different types of 
fibre one after the other in the same air flow having a sufficient 
turbulence, it is possible to mix the fibres well to each other 
and no mixing is needed at a preliminary stage. In addition, some advantageous embodiments of the 
method according to the invention are presented in the 
appended dependent claims 2 to 4.
