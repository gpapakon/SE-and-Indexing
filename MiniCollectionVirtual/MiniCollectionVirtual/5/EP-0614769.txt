<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording material suited 
for use in direct thermal imaging. Thermal imaging or thermography is a recording process wherein 
images are generated by the use of imagewise modulated thermal 
energy. In thermography two approaches are known : 
1. Direct thermal formation of a visible image pattern by 
imagewise heating of a recording material containing matter that by 
chemical or physical process changes colour or optical density. 2. Thermal dye transfer printing wherein a visible image 
pattern is formed by transfer of a coloured species from an 
imagewise heated donor element onto a receptor element. Thermal dye transfer printing is a recording method wherein a 
dye-donor element is used that is provided with a dye layer 
wherefrom dyed portions or incorporated dye is transferred onto a 
contacting receiver element by the application of heat in a pattern 
normally controlled by electronic information signals. A survey of "direct thermal" imaging methods is given e.g. in 
the book "Imaging Systems" by Kurt I. Jacobson-Ralph E. Jacobson, 
The Focal Press - London and New York (1976), Chapter VII under the 
heading "7.1 Thermography". Thermography is concerned with 
materials which are substantially not photosensitive, but are 
sensitive to heat or thermosensitive. Imagewise applied heat is 
sufficient to bring about a visible change in a thermosensitive 
imaging material. Most of the "direct" thermographic recording materials are of 
the chemical type. On heating to a certain conversion temperature, 
an irreversible chemical reaction takes place and a coloured image 
is produced. A wide variety of chemical systems has been suggested some 
examples of which have been given on page 138 of the above mentioned 
book of Kurt I. Jacobson et al., describing the production of a 
silver metal image by means of a thermally induced oxidation-reduction 
reaction of a silver soap with a reducing agent.  
 According to US-P 3,080,254 a typical heat-sensitive copy paper 
includes in the heat-sensitive layer a thermoplastic binder, e.g 
ethyl cellulose, a water-insoluble silver salt, e.g. silver stearate 
and an appropriate organic reducing agent, of which 4-methoxy-1-hydroxy-dihydronaphthalene 
is a representative. Localized heating 
of the sheet in the thermographic reproduction process, or for test 
purposes by momentary contact with a metal test bar heated to a 
suitable conversion temperature in the range of about 90-150 °C, 
causes a visible change to occur in the heat-sensitive
