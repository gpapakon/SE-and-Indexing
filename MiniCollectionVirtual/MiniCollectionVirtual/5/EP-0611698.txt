<ABSTRACT>
A method for packaging a plurality of paper rolls in a pack proposes to approximate the circumference of the rolls to a rectangular shape by upsetting, so that the space required by the pack is reduced. To carry out the upsetting, the rolls are arranged in rows and are upset progressively in the longitudinal direction of the row. A displacement movement transverse to the upsetting direction takes place at the same time. In the case of a plurality of rows of rolls, the upsetting begins at different moments, so that, during the upsetting, all the rows have a different length.

Method for packaging compressible objects, according to which 

1.1
several objects are juxtaposed with their planar sides (8) in one plane 
for forming a row, 
1.2
the objects are oriented along a line, 
1.3
the objects are compressed by shortening the row, 
1.4
the objects are moved laterally by a slider (18) during compression, 
1.5
during compression and lateral movement the objects remain oriented, in 
which 
1.6
the row is shortened in that it is moved between two converging side 
walls (22), whose surface is moved together with the row,
 
characterized in that, 
1.7
for packaging rolls (1), particularly those having a hollow core, the 
surface of the side walls (22) is moved at a speed different from the 

slider speed. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein 

2.1
several rows of rolls (1) are formed in juxtaposed manner and 
2.2
compression preferably begins at a different time for each row. 
Method according to claim 2, wherein during compression all the rows have 
different lengths. 
Method according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the compression begins at the 
front row in the movement direction. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein a belt (27) 
extending over the side walls (22) is moved together with the row of rolls (1). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the slider (18) 
has a rod (21). 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 7, wherein a slider (18) slides 
through an elongated slot (23) of the side walls (22). 
Device for packaging compressible objects having 

8.1
an orienting device, which  
 
8.1.1
forms at least one row of several juxtaposed objects and 
8.1.2
orients same along a line, 
8.2
a compressing device (17), which 
8.2.1
engages on the ends of the row of objects and 
8.2.2
shortens the row, 
8.3
a conveying means formed by a slider (18), which 
8.3.1
conveys the row of objects transversely to the compressing direction, 
wherein 
8.4
the compressing device (17) has two convergently positioned side walls 
(22) over which extends a driven belt (27), characterized in that 
8.5
the speed of the driven belt (27) of the side walls (22) differs from 
the speed of the slider (18) and the device for packaging rolls, is in 

particular intended for those having a hollow core. 
Device according to claim 8, wherein the orienting device 

9.1
has a planar bearing surface (11) for the rolls (1) and 
9.2
a slider (18) engaging laterally on the rolls (1). 
Device according to claim 8 or 9, wherein the slider (18) of the orienting 
device is formed by the slider (18) of the conveying device. 
Device according to one of the claims 8 to 10, wherein the side walls (22) 
are constructed in two-part form for forming elongated slots (23) through 

which passes the slider (18).
