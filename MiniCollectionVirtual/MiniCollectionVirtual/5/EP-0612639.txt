the edge of the filler inlet pipe (1) outside the cross-section 
of the lumen (5) of the filler inlet pipe (1) and 

which has a follower element cooperating with the lever arm 
(9) to initiate a swivelling movement of the cap (8),

Closure according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
spiral gear-teeth (13) on the displacement ring (12) and 

the engaging teeth on the lever arm (9) of the cap (8) are 
so shaped in relation to the steepness of the spiral 

contour, that the gear system formed between them can be 
activated in both force flow directions. 
Closure according to either of Claims 1 or 2, characterized 
in that in the aperture area on the top of the cap (8), at 

least one mark (83) is arranged such that a pump dispenser 
nozzle (47) can be introduced into the filler inlet (1) 

under robot control via a sensor system to fill the tank. 
Closure according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
closure comprises a device whereby, to open the cap (8) 

while still in the closed position (I), its pressure 
against a sealing gasket (54) surrounding the aperture (5) 

can at least be released. 
Closure according to Claim 9, characterized in that the 
said device consists of a rocker arm (57) one end (56) of 

which engages with the cap (8) in the area of its swivel 
axis (36) and the other end (58) is activated by a pump 

dispenser nozzle (47) during the coupling movement of the 
latter into the filler inlet pipe (1). 
Closure according to Claim 2, characterized in that the 
swivel axis (36) of the cap (8) is the axis of a bearing 

pin (35) onto which the cap (8) is rotatably pushed or 
attached by means of a stud (33) formed on it, and which is
