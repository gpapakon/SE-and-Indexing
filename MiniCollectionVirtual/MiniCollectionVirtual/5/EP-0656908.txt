<ABSTRACT>
Antibodies and other specific binding molecules which bind to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), particularly the 1-17, 18-21, 22-37, 45-53, 54-60, 59-70 or, especially, the 36-44 region, potentiate or enhance its activity. The antibodies may be generated (in situ) by administering an appropriately antigenic molecule. IGF-I potentiation is useful in a wide range of clinical conditions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to specific binding molecules,
means for generating them, and their use to potentiate or
enhance one or more biological activities of insulin-like
growth Factor I.Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a potent peptide
hormone (molecular weight of approximately 7,500 kDa)
which is thought to mediate many of the anabolic actions
of growth hormone (GH) as well as having independent
actions to stimulate cell hyperplasia, hypertrophy and
differentiation (Daughaday and Rotwein, Endocrine Reviews
10 68-92 (1989)). IGF-I is synthesised by many tissues
in the body and may therefore exert local autocrine/
paracrine actions; in addition, the liver secretes large
amounts of IGF-I into the blood where it can have
widespread endocrine actions on peripheral tissues. IGF-I
usually binds with high affinity to type 1 receptors,
which are thought to mediate most of its actions.
However, it can also bind weakly to insulin and type
2/mannose-6-phosphate receptors.Only very small amounts of IGF-I are found as free
peptide in vivo. Instead, it is bound to binding
proteins (IGFBPs) of which six high affinity proteins
have been characterised so far (Sara and Hall,
Physiological Reviews70 591-614 (1990)). The precise
function of this complex arrangement of IGFBPs with IGF-I
is unknown at present but several options have been
suggested: neutralisation of the "insulin like" actions
of IGF-I, inhibition of general IGF-I activity, transport
of IGF-I from blood to tissues or from one cell type to 
another, targeting of IGF-I towards tissue receptors,
maintenance of the IGF-I pool. Most experiments to date,
both in vivo and in vitro, have indicated that IGFBPs are
inhibitory for IGF-I action, although some reports have
demonstrated enhancement of IGF-I activity in vitro
(Elgin et al, Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences of the USA,84 3254-3258 (1987); and Conover,
Endocrinology130 3191-3199 (1992)). This apparent
potentiation of IGF-I action is thought to be due to the
adherence of the IGFBPs to cell surfaces thus presenting
IGF-I to its receptor; decreased affinity of the BPs for
IGF-I may also be involved, allowing receptors to compete
more effectively for IGF-I.WO-A-8908667 and WO-A-8909268 both disclose the
production of recombinant IGFBPs; the former additionally
discloses enhancement of IGF-I activity by the
recombinant protein.Some structural properties of IGF-I have been identified.
IGFBPs generally bind to residues 1-18 and 49-51 of IGF-I.
