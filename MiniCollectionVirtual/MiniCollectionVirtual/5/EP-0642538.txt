Process for the manufacture of carboxylated 
styrene/diene block copolymers by the radical 

grafting of a β-ethylene unsaturated mono- and/or 
dicarbonic acid or its anhydride (carboxyl 

monomer) onto unhydrogenated and/or selectively 
hydrogenated styrene/diene block copolymers on the 

basis of compositions of 10 to 90% by weight 
styrene - /90 to 10% by weight (if necessary 

selectively hydrogenated) diene units with weight-average 
molecular weights between 20,000 and 

300,000, preferably between 50,000 and 250,000, 
securing graft yields of between 50 and 99%, 

preferably between 80 and 95%, over a gel-content 
range for the carboxylated block copolymer of 0 to 

95% by weight, characterized by the fact that, at 
polymerization temperatures between 40 and 100°C, 

compositions of 0.2 to 10 parts by weight carboxyl 
monomer and 0 to 10 parts by weight carboxyl 

group- and anhydride group-free comonomer or 
comonomer mixture per 100 parts by weight block 

copolymer-backbone, in dry powdery and/or crumb-like 
and/or scale-like and/or leaf-like and/or 

granular reaction phase are grafted until a 
concentration of between 0.1 and 10% polymerized 

carboxyl monomer in relation to the block 
copolymer-backbone mass is obtained. 
Process as in claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that grafting takes place at polymerization 

temperatures between 50 and 90°C. 
Process as in claims 1 and 2, characterized by the 
fact that grafting continues until a concentration 

of between 0.5 and 5.0% polymerized carboxyl 
monomer in relation to the block copolymer-backbone 

mass has been obtained. 
Process as in claims 1 to 3, characterized by the 
fact that 0.2 to 10 parts by weight acrylic acid 

per 100 parts by weight of the block copolymer-backbone 
are used as carboxyl monomer. 
Process as in claims 1 to 3, characterized by the 
fact that 0.2 to 5 parts by weight maleic 

anhydride per 100 parts by weight of the block 
copolymer-backbone are used as carboxyl monomer.  

 
Process as in claims 1 to 5, characterized by the 
fact that graft monomer compositions with mass 

ratios of 1 part carboxyl monomer to 0.2 to 5 
parts carboxyl group- and anhydride group-free 

comonomer or comonomer mixture are used. 
Process as in claim 6, characterized by the fact 
that styrene is used as comonomer. 
Process as in claim 6, characterized by the fact 
that C
4
 to C
16
 olefins and/or dienes are used as 
comonomer. 
Process as in claim 6, characterized by the fact 
that C
1
 to C
8
 ester of acrylic acid and/or 
methacrylic acid are used as comonomer.
