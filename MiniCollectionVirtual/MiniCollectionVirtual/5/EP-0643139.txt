<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for preparing indigo which 
comprises bringing an indigo-producing bacteria belonging 

to genus 
Acinetobacter
 or treated products thereof into 
contact with an aqueous solution containing at least indole 

to have indigo formed and accumulated in the aqueous solution; 
and collecting indigo from the aqueous solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 
indigo from indole efficiently. Indigo has conventionally been prepared by a chemical 
synthetic method and has been broadly utilized as a dye for 
industrial uses. However, the chemical synthetic method is 
poor in a yield because it requires multiple steps of reactions. 
It has also a disadvantage that much amounts of by-products 
are produced due to the chemical decomposition. As a promising process among various processes for preparing 
indigo, there may be mentioned a process for preparing 
indigo from indole by using a microorganism of genus 
Pseudomonas (P.M.M. Gray: Proc. Royal Soc. London, Ser. B, 
Vol. 102, Pages 2263 to 2279 (1928), and Japanese Provisional 
Patent Publication No. 287691/1992), a process for 
preparing indigo from indole by using a microorganism of 
genus Mycobacterium (O. Sebck and H. Aeger: Nature, Vol. 
196, Pages 793 to 795 (1962)), a process for preparing 
indigo from indole by using a microorganism of genus Micrococcus 
(M. Fujioka and H. Wada: Biochimica et Biophysica  
 
Acta, Vol. 158, Pages 70 to 78 (1968)), a process for 
preparing indigo from indole by using, as an enzymatic 
catalyst, Escherichia coli transformed with a plasmid 
containing a gene which encodes xyleneoxygenase or naphthaleneoxygenase 
isolated from a microorganism of genus 
Pseudomonas (Burt D. Ensley, Barry J. Ratzkin, Timthyl D. 
Osslund and Mary J. Simon: Science, Vol. 222, Pages 167 to 
169 (1983)), a process for preparing indigo from indole by 
using a microorganism of Morcella species (J. Eyal, Md. A. 
Mabud, and J.F. Walter: Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 
Vol. 30, Pages 303 to 312 (1991)), and a process 
for preparing indigo from indole by using, as an enzymatic 
catalyst, Escherichia coil transformed with a plasmid 
containing a gene obtained from a microorganism of genus 
Rhodococcus (S. Hart and D.R. Woods: Journal of General 
Microbiology, Vol. 138, Pages 205 to 509 (1992)), but a 
practical technique for preparing indigo has not yet been 
established and development of a process for efficiently 
preparing indigo has been desired. It is an object of the present invention to prepare indigo 
in a high yield. The present inventors have intensively studied in order to 
establish a process for efficiently preparing indigo and 
found that strains of genus Acinetobacter efficiently 
produces indigo to accomplish the present invention. The present invention is to provide a process for preparing 
indigo which comprises bringing
