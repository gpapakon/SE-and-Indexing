<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel calcined magnesium/aluminum 
mixed oxide catalysts derived from certain water-insoluble magnesium 
and aluminum carbonate containing salts, which have been found to 
be particularly effective catalysts for use in the production of 
aminoethers, especially bis(2-dimethylaminoethyl) ether. Calcined mixed metal oxide compositions, including various 
different calcined magnesium/aluminum oxide compositions have been 
promoted as catalysts for the production of aminoethers, see e.g. USP 
5,214,142, as well as for numerous other base catalyzed type reactions. 
It is also known in the art that any two given calcined mixed metal 
oxide catalysts may in actuality be completely different compositions of 
matter even though they may have the same metals, said difference 
being evidenced by the obtaining of highly different comparative 
catalyst performance results for each catalyst. However, since such 
different calcined mixed metal oxide catalysts may not be readily 
delineated from each other by the use of simple formulas, it has become 
common place in the art to distinguish such catalysts from each other 
by defining them in terms of how the particular catalysts are derived. For instance, one type of mixed metal oxide catalysts disclosed in 
USP 5,214,142 are calcined catalysts derived from hydrotalcite type 
compositions of magnesium-aluminum hydroxide carbonate, prepared 
e.g. by coprecipitation of an aqueous solution of water-soluble metal 
salts, e.g. nitrates, sulfates or chlorides of magnesium and aluminum in 
the presence of an alkali metal base (e.g. sodium hydroxide), and a 
water soluble salt of a desired anion (e.g. sodium carbonate) followed by  
 
heating the precipitated slurry to produce the hydrotalcite type complex 
which is then dried and calcined to obtain the desired catalyst. 
However, the calcined magnesium/aluminum mixed oxide catalysts of 
this invention are clearly far removed from catalysts prepared by such 
coprecipitation techniques. Moreover, it is inherently difficult to 
reproduce catalysts having the exact or nearly the same beneficial 
properties by such coprecipitation type procedures. For instance, in 
addition to having to carefully monitor and correlate four different 
water-soluble ingredients, common adverse precipitation and/or 
filtration type problems may arise particularly during large scale type 
productions of such catalysts. U.S.P. 5,214,142 also discloses obtaining 
a magnesium/aluminum mixed oxide catalyst by mixing magnesium 
carb
