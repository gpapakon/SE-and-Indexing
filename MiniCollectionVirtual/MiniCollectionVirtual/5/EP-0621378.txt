<ABSTRACT>
There is a reinforcement device, in the case of which a strengthening panel 7 for exerting a heavy wall loading is provided for arrangement between a first and a second profile upright 2, and in each case a first and a second connection profile 10, 11, respectively, is fitted in a vertically running manner at the two lateral ends of the reinforcing panel 7. In this arrangement, it is desirable if the two connection profiles can be screw-connected to a profile web of the respectively associated profile upright. This is achieved in that the two connection profiles 10, 11 are of a different configuration, in that a screwing strip 14 of the first connection profile 10 is provided such that it terminates the profile and for abutment on a profile web 3 of the first profile upright 2, and a strip which is to be laid on a profile web of the second profile upright and belongs to the second connection profile 11 is provided, such that it terminates the profile, as a screwing strip 19. Screw heads, which are necessary for joining the connection profiles to the profile uprights and jut out with respect to the screwing strips, can no longer have a destructive effect with respect to wall panels of the prefabricated wall since they are located on the profile webs.

A reinforcement device for a construction wall, with a row of vertical profiled posts (2) 
which are U-shaped in cross-section and are orientated in the same way in the direction 

of the row and which form a profile web (3) and profile limbs (4) extending in the 
direction of the row, 


in which a reinforcement plate (7) is provided for applying a heavy wall load for the 
vertical and reinforcing arrangement between two adjacent first and second profiled 

posts, wherein, on a load side, alignment of the reinforcement plate (7) and the associated 

load-side profile limb (4) is provided, and wherein a first lateral end of the reinforcement 
plate projects towards the profile web of the first profiled post and the 

second lateral end of the reinforcement plate projects towards the U-cavity (5) of the 
second profiled post, 
in which a first and a second attachment profile (10, 11) extending vertically is 
mounted on the respective one of both lateral ends of the reinforcement plate (7), the 

first attachment profile (10) extending away from the reinforcement plate forms a 
screw strip (14) for abutting against and for screwing onto the first profiled post and 

the second attachment profile (11) extending away from the reinforcement plate is constructed 
for embracing one profile limb and for screwing onto the second profiled post 

and is provided with a strip for abutting against the profile web (3) of the second profiled 
post, and 
in which the length of the two attachment profiles (10, 11) extending in the longitudinal 
direction of the profiled posts (2) is equal to the height of the reinforcement plate 

extending in the longitudinal direction of the profiled posts, and the reinforcement 
plate has a length extending between the two profiled posts, 
characterized in that
the two attachment profiles (10, 11) are designed differently, in that the screw strip  
 

(14) of the first attachment profile (10) is provided terminating the profile and abutting 
against the profile web (3) of the first profiled post (2), and the strip of the second 

attachment profile (11) to be applied to the profile web of the second profiled post is 
provided terminating the profile and as a screw strip (19), and 
the length of the attachment profiles (10, 11) together with the height of the reinforcement 
plate (7) is equal to or greater than a third of the length of the reinforcement 

plate. 
A reinforcement device according to Claim 1, in which the first attachment profile 
forms a strip to be applied to the rear face of the reinforcement plate, 
characterized in 
that
 the strip (17) to be applied is angled at a right angle with respect to the screw strip 
(14). 
A reinforcement device according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the screw 
strip (14) of the second attachment profile (11) is associated with that area of the profile 

web (3) of the second profile post (2) situated in the continuation of the reinforcement 
plate (7). 
A reinforcement device according to one of the preceding Claims, in which with three 
adjacent profiled posts two adjacent reinforcement plates with common middle profiled 

post are provided [and] the two reinforcement plates engage over each other 

vertically, 
characterized in that
 the two reinforcement plates (7) together with the 
attachment profiles (10, 11) thereof are offset (9) from each other vertically with overlapping.
