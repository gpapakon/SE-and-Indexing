<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a motor vehicle for propelling 
and/or driving agricultural implements and/or machines, 
comprising a frame, at least one coupling member 
connected to the frame for coupling of an agricultural 
implement and/or a machine and at least three wheels each 
mounted on a shaft. Such motor vehicles exist in a great diversity. A 
drawback to the existing motor vehicles is that the wheel 
pressure thereof depends partly on the position of the 
centre of gravity of the coupled agricultural implement 
or the coupled machine. It is thus for instance possible 
for the wheel pressure of two front wheels to be limited, 
while the wheel pressure of two rear wheels is very great 
when a particular agricultural implement is coupled to 
the rear of the motor vehicle. The great wheel pressure 
on the rear wheels can result in undesired changes to the 
ground. The present invention has for its object to provide 
an improved motor vehicle for propelling and driving 
agricultural implements and/or machines, with which the 
wheel pressure can be influenced. It is thereby possible 
to distribute the total wheel pressure over the wheels 
such that all wheels exert a part of the total wheel 
pressure on the ground. The greatest wheel pressure 
applied to the ground is minimal when the wheel pressure 
of all wheels is equally great, this therefore being the 
ideal situation. The present invention provides for this purpose a 
motor vehicle wherein at least one of the shafts is 
displaceable substantially in the plane defined by the 
shafts. Through displacement of the shaft of at least one 
wheel the position of the wheels can be chosen such that 
the force of gravity applied to the centre of gravity of 
the motor vehicle with an agricultural implement optionally 
coupled thereto and/or the coupled machine passes to 
the greatest possible extent through the middle of the  
 
plane through the shafts. The force of gravity will 
thereby be distributed as uniformly as possible over the 
wheels. At least one coupling member preferably lies within 
the perimeter defined by the shafts. This step achieves 
that the centre of gravity of the motor vehicle with a 
coupled-on unit already lies in the vicinity of the 
middle of the plane through the shafts. Only a limited 
adjustment of at least one shaft will hereby be required 
for a uniform distribution of the wheel pressure. A preferred embodiment of the motor vehicle is 
characterized in that two shafts are connected to the 
frame at a fixed position. These two
