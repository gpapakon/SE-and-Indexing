<DESCRIPTION>
,2-DIALKYL- AND 2.2-DIALKYL-3.4-DIHYDR0-3-HYDR0XY- 2H-1-BENZ0PYRANS, THEIR E AS PHARMACEUTICALSThe present invention relates to novel 2,2-dial yl- and 2, 2-dialkyl-3, 4-dihydro-3-hydroxy- -2H-l-benzopyrans and salts, esters and N-oxides thereof and to processes for their production, as well as to their use as pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.More particularly the present invention provides in its broadest aspect:1. A 2,2-di(C1_5alkyl)- or trans-2, 2-di (Ci-salkyl) - -3, 4-dihydro-3-hydroxy- -6-(pyridin-4-yl) -2H- 1-benzopyran having a carboxamido moiety at the 4-position and wherein the pyridin-4-yl group is substituted at the 2- and/or 3-position by one or two members selected from the group comprising Cι_5alkyl, Cι_5hydroxyalkyl and Ci_5 (alkoxyalkyl) , or N-oxide thereof; or physiologically-hydrolysable and -acceptable ester of such a benzopyran or N-oxide or acid addition or quarternary ammonium salt of such a benzopyran, N-oxide or ester.Alkyl groups and moieties of compounds as defined under 1. above may be branched or straight chain. Preferred significances for substituents at the 2-position of the benzopyran nucleus as well as at the 2 and/or 3 position of the pyridinyl group are as set forth below in relation to formula I for R6 and R7 , and R and R . 

As hereinafter described, compounds of the present invention, e.g. as defined under 1 above, have potassium (K+) channel opening activity [see e.g. Cook et al., "Potassium Channels: Structure, Classification, Function and Therapeutic Potential", ed. N.S.Cook, Ellis Horwood, Chichester (1990), p.p. 181-255]. Benzopyran derivatives which are carboxamido-substituted at the 4-position, having K+-channel opening activity are extensively described in the art and comprise a substantial and recognisable compound class. The 4-carboxamido moiety in the compounds of the invention may comprise any of those known and described in the art in relation to K+-channel opening benzopyrans, including N-substituted, for example cyclic, carboxamido moieties. Preferred carboxamido moieties in relation to the compounds of the invention are those of the formula -N(R9)-CORio as defined below.As will be appreciated, the benzopyran nucleus of compounds defined under 1 may bear substituents in addition to those specifically defined. In particular they may, for example, be 7-Cι'_5alkyl substituted, especially 7-methyl substituted, e.g. as hereinafter indicated in relation to formula I.In accordance with the present invention 2,2-di-
