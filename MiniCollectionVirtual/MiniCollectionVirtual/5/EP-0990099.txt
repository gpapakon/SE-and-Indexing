<ABSTRACT>
Fluid-activatable shut-off device in an embodiment as a shut-off valve comprises a valve housing (1) formed with a flow passage (2) threrethrough and a movably supported valve body (3) which is movable between an open valve position, in which the valve body (3) is mainly withdrawn from the flow passage (2), which is thereby essentially cleared, and a closed valve position, in which the valve body blocks the flow passage (2). The valve body (3) is arranged to close the valve by abnormal flow conditions by a portion (7) being formed so that the flowing fluid provides a lifting force which affects the valve body (3) and seeks to move it towards the closed position. The valve body (3) may thereby close by an abnormal increase in the fluid flow rate, density or viscosity. The portion (7) may also be supported by an expansion pad arranged to push the lifting surface further into the flow passage as a consequence of changes in the fluid pressure and/or temperature, thereby providing increased lift so that the valve body (3) closes. The valve portion is equipped with plugs (11) for sequentially shutting off the choke channels to the flow of hydraulic/pneumatic fluid between the chambers 4-6 to thereby control the closing speed of the valve body (3), so that surges is avoided in the pipe system in which the valve is installed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fluid-activatable shut-off
valve according to the preamble of claim 1.DE-A-2 026 137 discloses a device according to the preamble
of claim 1. It comprises a valve body and a spring that
forces the valve body in a closed position. Whenever the
spring is broken or even not present the valve body is in an
open position. In order to prevent a backflow, the valve body
is provided with a relatively small portion that projects
into the flow passage and that forces the valve body in the
case of a backflow in the closed position. An increased fluid
flow rate or changed fluid viscosity and/or temperature does
not close the valve.The valve according to the invention is generally meant to be
mounted into a pipeline, a channel or similar, which carries
a fluid (air, water, oil or other liquid- or gaseous media).
The valve body is in contact with the flowing fluid and is
subjected to compressive and frictional forces. The valve
body is arranged to close the valve whenever said forces exceed
predetermined values. The amount of the forces varies 
with the fluid pressure, fluid density, flow rate and viscosity.The valve is particularly meant to allow shut-off of a liquid
or gas flow which intentionally or erroneously is brought to
exceed a predetermined upper rate.The lifting surface of the valve is generally related to the
parameters that are influential, according to the formula:
Shut-off: The formula for lifting force:
L=1/2 •CL •ρ •A •V2In which:
L =Lifting forceCL =Coefficient (empirical, expresses frictional
properties of the lifting surface
versus fluid rheology)ρ =Fluid density (influenced by pressure,
temperature and fluid compressibility)A =Surface area (effective lifting surface)V =Fluid flow rateAbnormal flow conditions of a flowing fluid arise in connection
with, among other things, pipeline breaks which may be
caused by accidents such as explosions, fires and the like,
in which abnormal flow conditions of the fluid may contribute
to, among other things, greater amounts of undesired liquid/gas
being supplied to a possible fire condition.Generally, the present invention aims at utilizing a changed
flow rate and perhaps also changed viscosity/temperature/pressure
by abnormal flow conditions in a flowing fluid. According to the invention, it is thereby aimed at eliminating
the need for external force by utilizing the kinetic (and
perhaps the hydraulic, rheologic and thermal) forces which
are already present in the pipeline/channel, the valve body
being formed to respond to

Fluid-activatable shut-off
valve comprising a valve housing (1) formed

with a flow passage (2) therethrough of desired cross-sectional
shape, and a movable supported valve body (3)

which is moveable between an open valve position, in
which the valve body (3) is mainly withdrawn from the

flow passage (2), which is thereby essentially cleared,
and a closed valve position, in which the valve body

blocks the flow passage (2) and closes the valve, and
where the valve body (3) when the valve is open, projects

into the flow passage (2) by a relatively small
portion (7) and is thereby subjected to the flow of a

fluid passing through the flow passage (2) in a defined
flow direction (Q), 
characterized in that
 said
relatively small portion (7) of the valve body (3) has

a form and weight so that the fluid forces originating
from a normal flow rate through the valve in the defined flow direction (Q), are unable

to move the valve body (3) from its open position,
while, the fluid forces acting during an abnormal flow

condition of the fluid passing through the flow passage (2) in the defined flow direction (Q), originating
from an increased fluid flow rate, change in

fluid viscosity and/or temperature, will lift the valve
body (3) from its open position and thereby close the

whole valve body (3). 
Fluid-activatable shut-off valve according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the valve body (3) is
supported in the valve housing (1) which in its open position

forms a first chamber (4) filled with a hydraulic/pneumatic
fluid and communicating with a second chamber (6) through

choke channels (5), so that in the closing movement of the
valve body (3) the hydraulic/pneumatic fluid is forced from

the first chamber (4) into the second chamber (6) through the
choke channels (5).
Fluid-activatable shut-off valve according to claim 1,

characterized in that
 the valve body (3) is 
equipped with plugs (11) which during the closing movement

sequentially shut off choke channels (5) to the passing of
hydraulic/pneumatic fluid between the chambers (4, 6) to

lower the closing speed in the final phase of the closing
movement.

the preceding claim,

curvature at its upstream end relative to the direction of

flow (Q) of the fluid.

claims 1-3,

 a valve bed (9) for slidably receiving the valve body
(3), essentially has the form of a cylinder section, and that

 said cylindrical bed (9)

which by the open valve projects into the flow passage.
