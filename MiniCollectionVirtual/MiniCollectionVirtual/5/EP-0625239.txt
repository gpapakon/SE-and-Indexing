<ABSTRACT>
This invention concerns a thermally insulating glass panel comprising two spaced apart sheets of glass (2, 3) enclosing a low pressure space, and interconnected by a peripheral joint of fused solder glass (4) and an array of pillars (5). The pillars (5) may be made entirely of metal. Alternatively the array may be made up of a combination of solder glass containing pillars and non-solder glass containing pillars. Additional support pieces may be arranged between the glass sheets (2, 3) before the peripheral joint of solder glass is fused. A method of constructing such panels is also disclosed, as well as other variants.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns improvements to thermally
insulating evacuated glass panels; these panels may be
used for windows.In WO 91/02878 (The University of Sydney) a thermally insulting glass panel is disclosed,
which comprises two spaced apart sheets of glass, 2 and 3,
enclosing a low pressure space; refer to figures 1, 2 and
3 (not shown to scale). These sheets are interconnected
by a peripheral joint of fused solder glass 4 and an
array of pillars 5.The pillars 5 ensure sufficient structural strength
to withstand the forces imposed by atmospheric pressure,
and maintain the sheets of glass spaced-apart. The
pillars 5 comprise a preform 6 made of glass, ceramic,
metal or other materials completely coated with a layer
of solder glass 7. The preform 6 is usually made from
the same material as the glass sheets in order that the
thermal expansion coefficients of the preforms, the
sheets and the solder glass should match. The purpose of
the preform is to maintain the separation of the glass
sheets during the fusion operation when the solder glass
has little mechanical strength.A pump-out tube 8 is incorporated into the panel and
is used during the construction of the panel to evacuate
the space between the glass sheets. The pump-out tube 8
is hermetically sealed by fused solder glass 9 to a hole
10 which passes from an interior face of glass sheet 2 to
the bottom of a recess 11 in the exterior face of glass
sheet 2. The recess 11 allows the pump-out tube 8 to be
melted and sealed leaving a stub which does not protrude 
beyond the plane of the exterior face of the glass sheet
2.A chemical getter 12 is often included within a
machined recess 13 in one of the sheets of glass in the
panel to counteract any rise in pressure due to out-gassing
from the glass.A low emittance coating may be provided on the
interior surface of one or both sheets of glass. The
emittance of the coatings is usually between 0.05 to 0.2
to ensure a thermal conductance due to radiation of
approximately 0.15 to 0.6 Wm-2K-1 or less.The internal pressure of the panel is usually below
10-2 torr and sometimes below 10-3 torr.In EP-A-0 421 239 (PPG Industries Inc.) an insulating unit is shown
having a pair of glass sheets spaced from one another by a plurality of supports or spacers. The
spacers are made from plastic material.The design of the pillar array is a trade-off between
reducing heat flow through the pillars (which imposes a
requirement to reduce the number and size of the pillars)
and reducing stresses within the panel and pillars
