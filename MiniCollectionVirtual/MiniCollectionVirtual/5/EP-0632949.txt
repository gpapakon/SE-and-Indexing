<ABSTRACT>
Encoded video recorder/player (44, 370, 964, 991) timer (40) preprogramming information (10) listed in a television calendar (Figure 8) allows a timer preprogramming feature on a video cassette recorder VCR (44, 370, 964, 991) to be programmed using a compressed code of as few as 1 to 8 digits, which are decoded by a decoder (954) built into a television (48, 950) to convert the compressed code into channel, date, time and length information. The compressed code indications associated with each television program can be printed in a television program calendar in advance. The user would use the television remote (956) or controls on the television (48, 950) to enter the code that signifies the program to be recorded. When the codes are entered they are transmitted to the television (48, 950) and then decoded in the television (48, 950) and then the codes themselves and the CDTL information, which is the result of decoding the codes, could be displayed "on screen" so that the user can verify that the proper codes have been entered.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to video cassette recorder systems and particularly
to the timer preprogramming feature of video cassette recorders (VCRs) and to an apparatus
and method for using encoded information to shorten the time required to perform timer
preprogramming and an apparatus and method of embedding the decoding of the encoded
information in a television receiver, video cassette recorder, cable box and satellite receiver.The video cassette recorder (VCR) has a number of uses, including playing back of
tapes filmed by a video camera, playing back of pre-recorded tapes, and recording and
playing back of broadcast and cable television programs.To record a television program in advance of viewing it, a two-step process is often
used: (1) obtain the correct channel, date, time and length (CDTL) information from a
television program guide, and (2) program this CDTL information into the VCR.
Depending on the model, year and type of the VCR, the CDTL information can be
programmed in various ways including: (i) pushing an appropriate sequence of keys in the
console according to instructions contained in the user's manual, (ii) pushing an appropriate
sequence of keys in a remote hand-held control unit according to instructions contained in
the user's manual (remote programming), and (iii) executing a series of keystrokes in the
remote hand-held control unit in response to a menu displayed on the television screen (on-screen
programming). Other techniques for timer preprogramming have been suggested
including: (iv) reading in certain bar-code information using a light pen (light pen
programming), and (v) entering instructions through a computer or telephone modem.
These various methods differ only in the physical means of specifying the information
while the contents, being CDTL and certain power/clock/timer ON-OFF commands are
generally common although the detailed protocol can vary with different model VCRs. 
Methods (i) and (ii) described above can require up to 100 keystrokes, which has inhibited
the free use of the timer preprorgramming features of VCRs. To alleviate this, new VCR
models have included an "On-Screen Programming" feature, which permits remote input of
CDTL information in response to a menu displayed on the television screen. Generally on
screen programming of CDTL information requires an average of about 18 keystrokes,
which is less than some of the prior methods but still rather substantial. Some of the other
techniques such as (iv) above, require the use of special equipment
