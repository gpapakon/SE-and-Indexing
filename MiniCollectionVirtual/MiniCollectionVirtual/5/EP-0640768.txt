<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a single-blade impeller for centrifugal pumps for the purpose of delivering solids-laden liquids, especially for delivering wastewater containing long-fibred constituents, the back discs (1, 2) of the single-blade impeller, and the blade (3) situated between these, together forming a passage (4). A reduction in the mass of the blade (3) and thus in the mass imbalance can be achieved, according to the invention, by the blade (3), apart from the leading edge of the blade having a blade base profile (9) which is thin over its entire extent by there being arranged, at the leading edge of the blade, a discharge-side boss (10) whose dimension corresponds at least to the thickness of the blade base profile (9), and by the radius of the blade head (11) corresponding to at least half the dimension formed by the blade base profile (9) and the boss (10).

Single impeller for centrifugal pumps for conveying
liquids loaded with solids, in particular for conveying

waste water with long-fibred constituents, having a
front cover plate (1), a rear cover plate (2) and,

arranged between these, a blade (3), all of which jointly
form a channel (4), the blade (3) having, with the

exception of the blade root, a basic blade profile (9)
which is thin over its entire extent, and there being

arranged at the root of the blade (3) a pressure-side
thickened part (10) whose dimension corresponds at least

to the thickness of the basic blade profile (9), while
the radius of the blade head (11) corresponds at least to

half of the dimension formed by the basic blade profile
(9) and the thickened part (10), characterized by a two-part

design of the basic blade profile (9) and thickened
part (10).
Single-impeller according to Claim 1, characterized
by a continuously extending transition from the

thickened part (10) to the basic blade profile (9).
Single-impeller according to Claim 2, characterized
in that the transition follows a tangent (13)

applied to the basic blade profile (9).
Single-impeller according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the transition from the thickened part to

the basic blade profile (9) takes the form of a sharp
edge.
Single-impeller according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the thickened part (10) at its transition to

the basic profile (9) covers an angular sector of
Δϕ ≤ 90°, ϕ = 0° being a radial ray tangential to the 

blade head (11).
Single-impeller according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the thickened part (10) without its transition

to the basic profile (9) covers an angular sector of
Δϕ ≤ 40°.
Single-impeller according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the thickened part (10) comprises a compact

body.
Single-impeller according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the thickened part (10) consists of a

different material than the basic blade profile (9).
Single-impeller according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the thickened part is produced by a contour-forming

guide profile (14).
Single-impeller according to Claim 9, characterized
in that the guide profile (14) consists of sheet

metal.
Single-impeller according to Claim 1 or 9, characterized
by a gap (12) between the basic blade profile (9)

and the thickened part (10, 14).
