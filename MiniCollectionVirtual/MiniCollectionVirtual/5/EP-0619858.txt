<ABSTRACT>
A fuel injector (1, 2) which uses interchangeable subassemblies (10, 11) to allow the injector to be converted from open to closed nozzle options without affecting engine installation, and without altering the timing or metering principles. The fuel injector (1, 2) is comprised of two subassemblies, a first subassembly of which is a timing or control subassembly (13) that is used with both the open and closed nozzle options, and a second subassembly which is formed in two versions, an open nozzle version (11) and a closed nozzle version (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a unit fuel injector system in particular with unit fuel
injectors for cyclically injecting fuel into an internal combustion engine in variable
amounts and with varying timing.Unit fuel injectors generally fall into two categories. That is, there are open nozzle injectors
of the type represented by US - A - 4,721,247 and there are closed nozzle injectors
of the type represented by US - A - 4,463,901. Open and closed nozzle injectors
have different injection characteristics, and neither type can be said to be better
than the other for all possible engine applications. Thus, it can be necessary for an
engine or motor vehicle manufacturer to keep both types of fuel injection systems
available for installation on any given engine depending solely on the particular
application for which the engine will be used.However, to develop and produce two separate fuel injection systems, knowing only
one will be used, not only increases the initial investment which must be made, but
also increases later piece prices, inventory and service costs. These cost factors offset
any benefits that might be associated with the fact that an injector which is
specifically designed to be only a closed nozzle injector or only an open nozzle
injector might be able to achieve a more optimized design than a multipurpose one,
e.g., a design that might be smaller, simpler, etc.In the earlier filed but later published EP - A - 0 548 329, it was first disclosed how it
could be possible to construct a unit fuel injector on a modular basis so that an upper
control subassembly could be interchangeably used with either an open nozzle type
or closed nozzle type injector nozzle subassembly. More specifically, this capability is
attained by locating the timing chamber relief valve structure wholly in the upper part
of the injector above the lower injection plunger. However, in that case, a
conventional injector nozzle structure was merely adapted for use with the control
subassembly, as opposed to the injector. as whole heing designed for the specific
purpose of providing a unit fuel injector system having interchangeable open and
closed nozzle type injector subassemblies. Thus the design of this earlier application
does not allow the fuel injector to be converted from open to closed nozzle options
without affecting engine installation, and without having to accept any performance 
or cost compromises relative to a fuel injector which is specifically designed to be
only either a closed nozzle injector or an open

<CLAIMS>
Unit fuel injector system for an internal combustion engine, each injector (1, 1', 2, 2')
comprising an injector body having injection orifices at a lower end thereof, an upper

plunger (25, 25', 25"), and a lower plunger (6, 7, 65, 76), which are mounted for
reciprocation within the injector body,


wherein the injector (1, 1', 2, 2') is divided into two subassemblies (10, 10', 13, 13'), an
upper control subassembly (13, 13') and a lower nozzle subassembly (10, 10'),
wherein the upper control subassembly (13, 13') comprises an upper portion of the
injector body and the upper plunger (25, 25', 25"),
wherein the lower nozzle subassembly (10, 10') is detachably mounted to a lower end
of the upper control subassembly (13, 13'),
wherein the lower nozzle subassembly (10, 10') is either of a closed nozzle type and
comprises a lower portion of the injector body with the injection orifices, a chamber

into which fuel to be injected is metered, the lower plunger (6, 7, 65, 76) for injecting
fuel metered into the chamber through the injection orifices, and a pressure

responsive valve (5, 66) for controlling fuel flow from the metering and injection
chamber to the injection orifices, or said lower nozzle subassembly (11, 11') is of an

open nozzle type, so that either lower nozzle subassemblies (10, 10', 11, 11') are
interchangeably mountable to the lower end of the upper control subassembly (13,

13'),
wherein all lower nozzle subassemblies (10, 10', 11, 11') have the same external size
and configuration, so that the injector (1, 1', 2, 2') can be converted from one nozzle

type to the other without affecting installation of the injector (1, 1', 2, 2') in an engine,
and
wherein all lower nozzle subassemblies (10, 10', 11, 11') utilize the same metering control
principles, so that the injector (1, 1', 2, 2') can be converted from one nozzle type

to the other without requiring modification of the upper control subassembly (13,
13').
