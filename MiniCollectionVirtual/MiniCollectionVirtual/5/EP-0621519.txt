<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a timepiece. This timepiece includes:   - display means (10) comprising a recursive cycle indicator (13) driven by an independent motor (11) and having an extra display position (14) and which is provided with a sign representative of the state of charge of an energy source operating the display means; and - a detection circuit (2, 16) designed so as, on the one hand, when detecting a predetermined level of charge of the energy source, to operate the display means (10) so that they displace the recursive cycle indicator (13) by a number of notches required to display the representative sign, and so as, on the other hand, to skip the extra position during normal running of the timepiece.   The invention applies to electronic timepieces, especially of analog type.
