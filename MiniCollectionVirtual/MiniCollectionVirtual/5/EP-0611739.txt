<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a ceramic body and a method of manufacturing 
such a body. The body is characterized by its composition, which comprises 20-30 at.% 

of magnesium, 20-30 at.% of silicon, 40-60 at.% of nitrogen and maximally 15 at.% of 
oxygen. A preferred composition corresponds to the formula MgSiN

, where x is 
smaller than 0.5. The manufacture of the ceramic body in accordance with the invention 

is simpler and cheaper than that of aluminium nitride, and a number of properties of 
said ceramic material are better than those of the known aluminium oxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a ceramic body. The invention also relates to a
method of manufacturing a ceramic body.Ceramic bodies have particular properties rendering them suitable for
many applications. For example, ceramic bodies in the form of blocks or rods are
available, for example, for use as refractory materials. A very important further use of
ceramic bodies is their application as carriers or substrates. These substrates generally
consist of a thin layer of sintered ceramic material, such as aluminium oxide (Al2O3),
magnesium oxide (MgO), beryllium oxide (BeO), aluminium nitride (AlN) or silicon
carbide (SiC). By virtue of their favourable electrically insulating properties such
substrates are used in passive and active electrical components, such as resistors,
capacitors, transformers and power transistors.The known ceramic bodies generally exhibit a combination of a number of
favourable and a number of unfavourable properties. For example, substrates of
relatively impure aluminium oxide and magnesium oxide have the advantage that they
are cheap. However, such substrates exhibit a rather poor heat conduction. Due to this
poor heat conduction they are unsuitable for use as substrate material in electrical
components in which a high development of heat occurs, which heat must be dissipated
via the substrate. A further disadvantage of these oxidic ceramic materials is that they
have a relatively high coefficient of expansion, rendering them less suitable for a
number of applications, in particular in the field of silicon semiconductor technology.
The coefficient of expansion of silicon ranges from 4 to 5.Beryllium oxide, aluminium nitride and silicon carbide have a much
higher heat conduction than aluminium oxide and magnesium oxide and, hence, can
more suitably be used as a heat-dissipating substrate or "heat sink" of an electrical
component. In addition, ceramic bodies of aluminium nitride and silicon carbide have a
coefficient of expansion which corresponds more to that of silicon, so that they are
more suitable for use as substrates in the silicon semiconductor technology. However,
the ceramic aluminium nitride technology is difficult due to the poor reproducibility and 
problems relating to purity. As a result, ceramic substrates of pure aluminium nitride
are relatively expensive. Ceramic substrates of silicon carbide are also relatively
expensive because the material is difficult to process. In addition, ceramic silicon
carbide has a relatively high dielectric constant, so that this material
