<ABSTRACT>
A transmitting and receiving module for bidirectional optical data and signal transmission with at least one optical transmitter (1), at least one optical receiver (2), at least one fibre connection (4) for an optical fibre (6), an optical lens coupling system (7, 9, 10) and at least one intermediate beam splitter (3) disposed in the free beam path (11), arranged in a common housing (5), is intended to have an optical transmitter with a very stable emission wavelength. The optical transmitter (1) is a laser diode which is directly or indirectly connected to a heating device (12). Field of application: Transceiver module for subscriber connection.
