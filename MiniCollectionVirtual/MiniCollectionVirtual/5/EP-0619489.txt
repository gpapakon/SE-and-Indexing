<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic method of inspecting repaired stub 
tubes in a boiling water reactor. The top and bottom 

ends of each stub tube (14) are respectively welded to 
the corresponding control rod drive housing (10) and to 

the bottom head (12) of the reactor pressure vessel. 
Under certain conditions, a crack (26) can form in the 

heat-affected zone of the stub tube adjacent to the 
upper weld (16), necessitating repair by installing a 

mechanical seal (20). A probe (24) inserted in the 
control rod drive housing has transducers (28a, 28b, 

28c) which transmit pulsed ultrasonic energy toward a 
machined surface-air gap interface (30) disposed to 

reflect the pulse trains generally axially through the 

stub tube. The radial and azimuthal dimensions of a 
radial crack in the stub tube are determined in 

dependence on which pulsed trains are reflected back to 
the probe by the crack via the interface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to nondestructive 
examination of material, such as metal, for voids, 
flaws, cracks and other defects that can be detrimental 
to the integrity of the material. Specifically, the 
invention relates to the ultrasonic inspection of stub 
tube components following their repair in nuclear power 
reactors of the boiling water type. The structure of a water-cooled and water-moderated 
nuclear reactor of the boiling water type is well known. 
(See, for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,548,785 and 
5,118,464 to Richardson et al.) A boiling water reactor 
includes a pressure vessel containing a nuclear reactor 
core submerged in a coolant-moderator such as light 
water. The core, which is surrounded by an annular 
shroud, includes a plurality of replaceable fuel 
assemblies arranged in spaced relation between an upper 
core grid and a lower core plate. A plurality of control rod drive housings penetrate 
the pressure vessel and house control rod drives by 
which a plurality of control rods are selectively 
insertable among the fuel assemblies for controlling the 
core reactivity. The control rod drive housings support 
control rod guide tubes which receive and house the 
control rods when they are withdrawn from the core. The 
guide tubes, in turn, support fuel assembly support 
members, each of which is formed with sockets for  
 
receiving the nose pieces of four adjacent fuel 
assemblies. Each control rod and the four fuel assemblies 
comprise a fuel cell of the core. The four fuel 
assemblies are laterally supported at their upper ends 
in an opening in the upper core grid formed by 
intersecting and interlocking beams. At their lower 
ends the four fuel assemblies are vertically supported 
on the fuel assembly support member fitted to the top 
end of the control rod guide tube, lateral support being 
provided by passage of the guide tube through an 
aperture or hole in the lower core plate. Penetration of the control rod drive housings 
through the bottom head of the reactor pressure vessel 
is accomplished using stub tubes. Each stub tube, 
suitably shaped at its bottom end to fit the curvature 
of the bottom head at its particular location, is 
secured in a corresponding aperture or hole in the 
bottom head by a circumferential weld. The need for 
precise positioning of the stub tube is avoided by 
finish boring of its inside diameter, after it is welded 
in place, to receive the control rod drive housing. The 
control rod drive housing is welded to the top end of 
the stub

A method for sizing a generally radially 
disposed crack (26) in a first generally cylindrical 

metal component (14, 16), characterized by the steps of: 
   forming a first interface (30) which reflects 

ultrasonic energy at one end of said first generally 
cylindrical metal component; 

   placing ultrasonic transducer means (24) inside 
said first generally cylindrical metal component; 

   transmitting pulsed ultrasonic energy from said 
ultrasonic transducer means toward said first interface 

at a predetermined angle relative thereto such that said 
first interface reflects said pulsed ultrasonic energy 

through the body of said first generally cylindrical 
metal component in a generally axial direction; and 

   detecting pulsed ultrasonic energy reflected by 
said crack and impinging on said ultrasonic transducer 

means. 
The method as defined in claim 1, characterized 
in that said ultrasonic transducer means comprises a 

plurality of transducers (28a, 28b, 28c) arranged in a 
linear array and directed to transmit pulsed ultrasonic 

energy along parallel paths, each transducer being 
positioned at a different elevation, said transducers 

being activated in a predetermined sequence, whereby the 
cross section of said first generally cylindrical metal 

component is scanned in a generally radial plane.

in that said first generally cylindrical metal component 

is joined to a second generally cylindrical metal
