<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of electrochemical
analysis of metals and also to apparatus for use in performance
of the method. The invention relates particularly to analysis
of trace metals which may occur in biological and chemical
samples. Such samples may include human and animal blood,
plasma, serum and tissue samples, industrial and domestic waste
water, process samples, sewage, food, drinking water, soil,
surface and ground water, paint, dust, petrochemicals and air.
The invention is particularly applicable to analysis of heavy
metals, including transition lanthanide and actinide elements.
Group 3 and 4 metals, including tin and lead may also be
assayed.Electrochemical methods of metal analysis which have been
used include anodic and cathodic, amperometric and
potentiometric stripping analysis. A common problem associated
with these techniques when used for analysis of trace metals in
biological samples is that the metals bind strongly to
components of the sample making direct measurement impossible.
It has been necessary to digest the biological sample in order
to release the metal or to use other similar metals to saturate
binding sites. Acid hydrolysis together with addition of
chromium, mercury and or calcium has been used to release lead
from blood samples allowing measurement by anodic stripping
analysis. A further problem which has been encountered in
electrochemical methods for analysis of trace metals and
biological samples is that the components of the sample,
whether or not digested, may have a detrimental effect on the
electrochemical processes which occur at the surface of the
electrode. This can be overcome by high dilution of the
specimen but such dilution has a detrimental effect on assay
sensitivity. Traditional thin layer mercury electrode based
analyses are subject to variation of the analyte solution
volume and are reliant on highly controlled diffusion
characteristics. DE-2025324 discloses use of laminated mercury electrodes.According to a first aspect of the present invention
there is provided an electrochemical metal analysis apparatus
including a laminated electrode having a layer of mercury
compound or salt supported thereon, further including a layer
of permeable polymeric material in which the mercury or the
mercury compound or salt is dispersed, wherein the layer of
permeable polymeric material includes an electrochemically
inert insoluble particulate material.The laminated electrode is preferably formed by printing.The electrode may comprise a printed carbon
