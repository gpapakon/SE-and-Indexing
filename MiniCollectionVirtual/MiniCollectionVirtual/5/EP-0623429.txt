<ABSTRACT>
Pneumatic tool comprising a motor element (A) including a body (1) in which there is housed a pneumatic motor (4), the said body including, at one end, a tool holder (B) exhibiting a tubular element (32) with, at its free end, an angular part with a member (45) intended to support a tool and connected via a kinematic link (37, 43) to a shaft (34) guided inside the tubular element (32) and intended to be driven by the rotor of the pneumatic motor (4), characterised in that the tool holder and the body are independent and are assembled using a bayonet-type system, the pneumatic motor including means for coupling it to the shaft (34) of the tool holder (B), the tubular element (32) being fitted so that it can pivot about its shaft and means being provided for setting it in all suitable angular positions.

A pneumatic tool of the type comprising a drive unit (A)
comprising a body (1) in which a pneumatic motor (4) is

housed, the said body comprising, at one end, means (2)
for connecting it to a compressed air distribution tube

with means (19) for controlling the admission of
compressed air to the motor and, at the other end, a head

(12) provided with means for the assembly of a tool
holder (B) having a tubular element (32) for 
guiding a
shaft (34) provided with means for coupling with the

pneumatic motor (4), the said tool holder (B) having, at
one end, an angular part (39, 75) provided with a device

(45, 45a, 45b) intended to support a tool and connected
by a kinematic coupling to the said shaft (34), the means

for the assembly of the head (12) to the tool holder (B)
being of the type in which the said tool holder may be

fixed in different angular positions in relation to the
head and to bayonets, one of the elements, the head (12)

or the tool holder (B), comprising ramps (28), whereas
the other element comprises lugs (70) intended to

cooperate with the ramps,
characterised in that
 the tubular element (32) for
guiding the shaft (34) is mounted pivoting on a bush

(60), means for the angular locking of the said tubular
element (32) being inserted between the two elements and,

the bush (60) being intended to be mounted on the head,
the one of the latter, the head or the bush (60),

comprising the lugs and the other the ramps (28), the
latter each having at least two notches (29, 30), the one

of the notches corresponding to a position in which the
tubular element (32) for guiding the shaft (34) may pivot

in relation to the bush (60), whereas the other (30)
corresponds to a position in which the locking means (57,

65) angularly fix the said tubular element (32). 
A pneumatic tool, according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the bush (60) is extended by a
skirt (68) intended to cover the head (12) and

comprising, internally, the lugs (70), the head having
the ramps (28), the said bush (60) being engaged on the

tubular element (32) and bearing against a stop (54) of
the latter, in the said bush (60) there being provided a

housing (63) into which a compression spring (65) is
inserted which circumscribes the tubular element (32) and

one end of which bears against the base of the housing
and the other end against a washer (57) mounted on the

tubular element (32) and bearing dog points (58) intended
to cooperate with countersunk holes (25) of the

corresponding end of the head (12) and angularly offset
in a regular manner.
A pneumatic tool, according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the tubular element (32) comprises
a shoulder (55) drilled with holes (56) through which the

dog points (58) pass.
