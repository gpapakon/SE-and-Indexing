<ABSTRACT>
For this purpose the bearing bracket (3) is according to the invention of single-part design. The said bearing bracket has a support strap (4) at the top, by means of which it is fixed, supported so that it bears externally on the frame side member of the vehicle, and a fork at the bottom with legs (8, 9) of different thickness. At the same time one of the two bearing bracket legs (8, 9), especially the outer (8), is designed with a cross-section so solid that it can absorb by far the larger proportion of lateral forces, whereas the other of the two bearing bracket legs (8, 9), especially the inner (9) is designed with a thinner cross-section so that in the fixing of the spring mounting eye (10) it is transversely flexible without cross-sectional overstressing in the elasticity range and a predetermined, sufficiently large preloading can be transmitted to the central part (10/1), to be clamped, of the spring mounting eye (10) by way of the said leg with a clamping bolt. The longitudinal and vertical forces on the other hand are absorbed in approximately equal proportions by the two legs (8, 9) of the bearing bracket (3). The bearing bracket (3) according to the invention can be implemented in a simple and inexpensive manner, for example by a casting.

<CLAIMS>
Bearing mount for the attachment of the eye at the end of a leaf spring in 
motor vehicles, particularly in commercial vehicles, which bearing mount is 

in a single piece, is attached to a frame longitudinal member (1) and has a 
jaw open towards the lower end, in which jaw a spring-eye mount (10) is 

fastened by means of a continuous clamping bolt (11), the lower end of the 
jaw being provided on an L-shaped support bow (4), of which the vertical 

arm (4/1) of the L is supported on and attached to the outside of the vertical 
web (1/1) of a frame longitudinal member (1) and the lower horizontal arm 

(4/2) of the L is supported on and attached to the lower horizontal web 
(1/3) of the frame longitudinal member (1), characterised in that the jaw of 

the bearing mount (3) is laterally limited by two arms (8, 9) of unequal 
cross section, of which arms the outer arm (8) consists of an upper section 

(8/1) which is provided at the corner area of the L-shaped support bow (4) 
and points outwards at an angle and downwards and of a vertical section 

(8/2) which is attached at the lower end of said upper section (8/1) and is 
designed to support the central part (10/1) of the spring-eye mount (10) on 

the outside, and that the vertical, downward-pointing inner arm (9) located 
towards the free end of said support bow (4) is attached to the lower side 

of the horizontal arm (4/2) of the L-shaped support bow (4), that arm (8 or 
9) with the thinner cross section being restrictedly flexible in transverse 

direction so that when during the attachment of the spring-eye mount (10) 
by means of the clamping bolt (11) said bolt (11) is being tightened without 

an excessive strain being exerted on the cross section in the elasticity area 
said arm (8 or 9) is moved in the direction of the other, inflexible bearing-mount 

arm and that a preset, sufficiently large initial tension is thus 
transferred to the sleeve-shaped central piece (10/1) of the spring-eye 

mount (10) via said arm (8 or 9), which central piece (10/1) is to be 
clamped so as to prevent it from turning. 
Bearing mount according to Claim 1, characterised in that with regard to 
their cross section the two arms (8, 9) are designed for absorbing 

longitudinal and vertical forces in approximately identical proportions and 
that, with regard to its cross section, the one, inflexible arm (8) is insofar 

designed for taking up the larger proportion of transverse forces occurring 
whilst the vehicle is in motion that a bearing-mount reinforcement rib (12)  

 
is provided between the upper oblique section (8/1) of the outer bearing-mount 

arm (8) and the vertical arm (4/1) of the L-shaped support bow (4). 
Bearing mount according to one of the Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the oblique upper section (8/1) of the outer bearing-mount arm (8) has a T-, 

double T- or U-shaped cross section, and the lower, vertical part (8/2) of 
the bearing-mount arm (8) is of plate-type design. 
Bearing mount according to one of the Claims 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the inner bearing-mount arm (9) is restrictedly flexible in transverse 

direction and has an upper section (9/1) with a cross section endowed with 
the cross-section elasticity required and a lower section (9/2) of plate-type 

design. 
Bearing mount according to Claim 1, characterised in that owing to the use 
of said bearing mount in conjunction with a spring-eye mount (10) 

consisting of an outer sleeve (10/2) made of elastic material, particularly 
rubber, and of an inner sleeve (10/1) made particularly of metal, vulcanised 

into said outer sleeve and forming the central part and in that said spring-eye 
mount (10) is pressed with its outer sleeve (10/2) into the eye (2) of the 

leaf spring, whereby in order to clamp its inner sleeve (10/1) between both 
bearing-mount arms (8, 9) so that it will not turn the necessary initial 

tension can during the assembly of this spring-eye mount (10) be 
transferred to the inner sleeve (10/1) of the spring-eye mount (10) via the 

flexible bearing-mount arm (8 or 9) by means of tightening the clamping 
bolt (11) after it has been pushed through the passage bores aligned with 

each other and provided in the two bearing-mount arms (8, 9) and through 
the central passage bore in the inner sleeve (10/1).
