<ABSTRACT>
The connection strip with integrated cut-off includes input contacts and output contacts, mounted face-to-face in an insulating body, and being accessible on a front face of the latter and having an opposed internal terminal part for elastic linking to one another. It is characterised in that it further includes internal insulating keys (10), mounted movably in the said body (1) between a position for cutting-off and for not cutting-off the terminal linking parts (4B, 5B) of the contacts (4, 5). Application: connection with cut-off of telephone lines.

A connecting terminal strip with integral
disconnection means including input and output contacts (4, 5)

retained in a insulative body (1) and each having a first
terminal part (4A, 5A) accessible externally on said body and

a second terminal part (4B, 5B) inside said body for elastic
connection of each input contact to one of the output

contacts, and disconnection means (10) that can be interposed
between the connecting terminal parts of the input and output

contacts, characterised in that said disconnection means (10)
comprise insulative disconnection wedges trapped and mobile in

said body (1) and actuated from outside said body between a
disconnection position in which each wedge separates and

isolates the connecting terminal parts (4B, 5B) of said input
and output contacts (4, 5) concerned and a non-disconnection

position in which each wedge is retracted relative to the
terminal parts of the input and output contacts concerned and

has no effect on them.
A terminal strip according to claim 1 wherein said
input and output contacts face each other and are disposed in

two parallel rows with their first terminal part accessible on
a front face of said body, characterised in that said body (1)

is formed of front and rear parts (2, 3) assembled together,
the front part constituting a connection strip (2) holding

said input and output contacts and having a rear open junction
face from which the connecting terminal parts of the contacts

project and the rear part constituting a disconnection strip
(3) having an open front junction face receiving said

connecting terminal parts of the contacts, containing said
disconnection wedges (10) and having facing slots (11), said

slots being open on the front junction face of the
disconnection strip and closed by the connection strip

assembled to it and being assigned to guiding said
disconnection wedges (10).
A terminal strip according to claim 2 characterised
in that said disconnection wedges (10) are double wedges and

each is assigned to a pair of input contacts (4) and to the
facing pair of output contacts (5) and comprises two

disconnection arms (15, 16) carried by a support (13) and
projecting to either side of said support, and in that said

guide slots (11) are centred between the two contacts of the
various pairs of facing contacts.
A terminal strip according to claim 3 characterised
in that each disconnection wedge (10) includes an actuator arm

(10) on said support (13) and received in each of the facing
guide slots (11).
A terminal strip according to claim 4 characterised 
in that the actuator arm (14) of each of said disconnection

wedges (10) projects from the terminal strip (3) on at least
one side thereof.
A terminal strip according to claim 4 or claim 5
characterised in that said actuator arm (14) extends along a

front edge of said support (13) for each disconnection wedge
(10) considered in said disconnection strip and projects on

either side of said support, transversely to said front edge
thereof, having a transverse dimension or width substantially

equal to the distance between the contacts of each pair.
A terminal strip according to any one of claims 4 to
6 characterised in that it further includes a coupling arm

(18) connecting said disconnection wedges (10) to each other
and extending at least partly to the outside of the

disconnection strip (3) for simultaneous actuation of said
disconnection wedges.
A terminal strip according to any one of claims 3 to
7 characterised in that said disconnection arms (15, 16) are

rear arms on said support (13) for each disconnection wedge
(10) considered in said disconnection strip and each has a

front facet (15A, 16A) having a shape adapted for their
insertion between and along the connecting terminal parts

(4B, 5B) of said contacts (4, 5).
