<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the sector of remote-control systems, particularly for monitoring access to a motor vehicle. According to the invention, the receiver module comprises a means for the selection of messages transmitted by a transmitter (30) as a function of the zone (D1, D2) in which the latter is located. If the receiver module detects that the function commanded by the transmitter is authorised for the zone where the transmitter is located, a selection means authorises the processing of the command.
