<ABSTRACT>
Provided are a method and a system for simultaneously specifying a 
first and a second range (111, 113) for a first and a second parameter 

respectively. A control window (100) whose axes (101, 103) represent 
the two parameters and a control element (104) movable therein, 

typically by means of a pointing device, are presented on a display 
coupled to a computer system. The coordinates of a first and a second 

position (105, 107) of the control element are determined. The first 
range is adjusted according to the first components of the coordinates 

of the first and second positions and the second range according to the 
second components of the coordinates of the first and second positions. 

After the ranges are specified, a first operation is designated which 
will be executed if a data stream of the first and second parameters 

satisfies the first and second ranges. The data stream is monitored to 
determine if the first and second ranges are satisfied. The first 

operation is executed on the computer system if the first and second 
ranges are satisfied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a graphical user interface for 
displaying data on a display of a data processing system in an object-oriented 
software program. More particularly, it relates to a control 
for changing a plurality of parameter ranges. To provide accessibility and ease of use to the functions of a 
modern day data processing system, it has become commonplace to 
construct a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to control the system. To 
maximize the amount of information while maintaining the legibility of 
that information presented by computer display, certain display controls 
have been employed. Traditionally, the values of scaled parameters are controlled by 
the use of a slider or a knob in a graphical user interface. Such 
parameters can be changed to a value within a given range, e.g., from 
zero to a predetermined maximum value, or to encompass a range of values 
by manipulating the appearance of the slider or knob in the GUI. As the 
parameters are independent of each other, there is generally one control 
for each parameter. To change a parameter associated with a slider or 
a knob, the user will bring a pointer, typically controlled by a mouse, 
to a particular portion of the slider or a knob, and manipulate the 
slider or knob appearance. Other user interfaces allow the user to 
specify exact numerical values by means of data entry fields in a window 
or dialog box. While this type of graphical user interface is adequate, as the 
number of applications which share the available presentation space in 
the GUI proliferate in number, screen space becomes a premium. 
Generally, the display space allocated to each application's window will 
shrink in size. When an application uses a number of controls for each 
of the variables, not all of them can be displayed at the same time. 
Therefore, it would be desirable to have a control which could  
 
manipulate a plurality of independent variables. This invention teaches such a control. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method for 
controlling operation execution in a data processing system, comprising 
the steps of:
 
   presenting a control window and a control element movable therein 
on a display coupled to a data processing system;
 
   determining coordinates of both a first and a second position of a 
control element movable within the control window, the coordinates of 
each position having a first and a second component;
 
   adjusting a first range for a first parameter according to the 
first components of
