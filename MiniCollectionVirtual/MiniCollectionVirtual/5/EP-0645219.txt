<ABSTRACT>
A clamping device includes two clamping units. At least 
one of the clamping units includes a sheave 12 having a pinion 

portion 121 biased toward the other one of the clamping units 
so as to hold an elongated piece 9 between the clamping units 

and a rack member 112 engaging the pinion portion 121 of the 
sheave 12. Preferably, each of the clamping units has a 

frictional clamping surface which presses against the 
elongated piece 9.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clamping device for an elongated 
piece, more particularly to a clamping device for clamping 
steadily an elongated piece as defined in the preambles of 
claims 1 and 10. Such clamping devices are known from the 
document US-Patent No. 3 422 960. Clamping devices for clamping elongated articles is 
known. A conventional clamping device generally comprises a 
stationary unit, a guide unit spaced apart from the 
stationary unit at a predetermined distance, a movable unit 
movably mounted on the guide unit and a bias unit 
interconnecting the guide unit and the movable unit so as to 
bias the movable unit to move toward the stationary unit so 
as to hold an elongated piece between the stationary unit 
and the movable unit, wherein the guide unit comprises a 
guide block and a rack member mounted on a top surface of 
the guide block (US-Patent No. 3 422 960). However, in the 
conventional clamping device, the force exerted by the bias 
unit is insufficient to effectively clamp an elongated piece 
between the movable unit and the stationary unit or it may 
require two hand operation which is to some extent 
inconvenience. The main objective of this invention is to provide a 
clamping device for clamping steadily an elongated piece 
which overcomes the deficiencies of the prior art. To this end, a clamping device in accordance with an 
aspect of the present invention is characterized by the 
features specified in the characterizing part of claim 1 and 
a clamping device in accordance with another aspect of the 
present invention is characterized by the features specified 
in the characterizing part of claim 10.  
 The movable unit comprises a sheave which has two wheel 
portions and a pinion portion that is located between the 
wheel portions and that engages the rack member so as to guide 
the wheel portions of the sheave to move on the guide block. 
The bias unit interconnects the guide unit and the movable 
unit so as to bias the wheel portions of the sheave to move 
toward the stationary unit, thereby holding an elongated piece 
between the sheave and the stationary unit. According to another aspect of the present invention, a 
clamping device comprises two spaced guide units, two movable 
units and two bias units. Each of the guide units comprises 
a guide block and a rack member which is secured on the top 
surface of the guide block. Each of the movable units 
comprises a sheave which has two wheel portions and a pinion 
portions that is located between the wheel portions
