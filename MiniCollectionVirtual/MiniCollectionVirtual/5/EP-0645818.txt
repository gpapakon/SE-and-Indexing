<ABSTRACT>
An electronic, monolithically integrated device is proposed, to which lines are fed from outside, namely at least one (01, 02) for supplying the electronic device with operating voltage or operating current and/or at least one for signal inputs and/or signal outputs. On the lines, it is possible for high-frequency AC voltages to be influenced by external high-frequency electromagnetic fields, the amplitudes of which AC voltages are of similar order of magnitude and higher than the instantaneously applied line potential, as a result of which at least one (3) of the pn junctions, indirectly or directly connected to one line (01) and blocked in the working range, is forward-biased by the influenced high-frequency AC voltage in the negative half-cycle range, so that directional currents arise which inject minority currents into the semiconductor material surrounding the pn junction (3) in question, which minority currents are at least partly captured from at least one of the components of the monolithically integrated circuit and shift the working point thereof, which leads to destruction of the function of the electronic device. The instantaneous forward-biasing of the blocked pn junction (3) in the negative half-cycle range of the influenced high-frequency AC voltage is in this case prevented by means of a diode (5) in the line path.

Integrated circuit having a substrate (000),
having a pn junction (3) arranged on the substrate,

where the pn junction is connected to a pad of the
integrated circuit and is reverse-biased during working

operation of the circuit and can be forward-biased by
