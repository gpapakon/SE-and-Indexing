<ABSTRACT>
Hydrothermally synthesized porous kaolinite is 
used as a carrier in a bioreactor. The carrier-biocatalyst 

composite includes the synthesized 
kaolinite as carrier and a biocatalyst, such as an 

enzyme, fixed onto the synthesized kaolinite. Improved 
fixing of the enzyme can be achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to
use of porous synthesized kaolinite as an inorganic carrier
for a biocatalyst, such as an enzyme, to be charged into a bioreactor.
The invention
also relates to a biocatalyst carrier-biocatalyst
composite and a bioreactor system using such a
composite, as well as to a method of making the composite.It has been known for a long time that
enzymes are adsorbed on synthesized macromolecular
materials or enzymes are enclosed and fixed by gels
in order to industrially effect bioreaction by using
the enzymes. Since these carriers are inorganic
materials, they unfavourably have low strength,
and are unsuitable in increasing the size of
the carrier. For this reason, it 
has been recently common to use purified inorganic
minerals, such as silica and alumina, as carriers.However, for example, when silica is used as a
carrier, there is a problem that since silica is likely
to be damaged with alkali, it cannot be used over a
entire pH range. When alumina is used as a carrier,
there is a problem that an amount of an enzyme fixed on
the carrier cannot be increased. Further, when a natural
inorganic mineral is used as a carrier, such a mineral
inevitably contains impurities. Consequently, it is
feared that ions such as Ca++ and K+, which the enzyme
dislikes, dissolves out, and thus the activity of the
fixed enzyme is deteriorated.J.M. Adam et al. International Biotechnology
Laboratory 6(3): 22-27 (1988) describes ceramic
biosupports derived from the clay mineral kaolinite.It is an object of the present invention to solve
or reduce the above-mentioned problems, and the invention
can provide carriers for a biocatalyst which can be stably used
over the entire pH range, or have a large capacity of
fixing an enzyme thereon, or do not contain impurities
which dissolve out to deteriorate the activity of the
enzyme.The invention in one aspect consists in use of
porous synthesized kaolinite as a biocatalyst carrier,
the synthesized kaolinite being synthesized by
hydrothermal crystallization.The invention further consists in a carrier-biocatalyst
composite comprising porus synthesized 
kaolinite as a carrier and a biocatalyst such as an
enzyme supported on the carrier, the synthesized
kaolinite being synthesized by hydrothermal
crystallization.The invention also provides a bioreactor system
comprising a bioreactor vessel, and a carrier-biocatalyst
composite as defined above in the bioreactor vessel.The invention also consists in a method of making a
carrier-biocatalyst composite as defined
