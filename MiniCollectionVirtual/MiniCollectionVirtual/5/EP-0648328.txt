<ABSTRACT>
In a method of assaying for an analyte in a fluid sample, the presence of the analyte is detected by determining the resulting change in refractive index at a solid optical surface in contact with the sample, which change is caused by the analyte involving or influencing the binding or release of a refractive index enhancing species to or from, respectively, the optical surface, the refractive index of the refractive index enhancing species varying with wavelength. According to the invention, the determination comprises determining the variation with wavelength of the resulting change of refractive index, caused by the variation of refractive index with wavelength of the refractive index enhancing species, for a number of discrete wavelengths or for a continuous range of wavelengths. This variation is representative of the amount of analyte.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement in
assays of the type wherein the presence of the analyte is
detected by determining a change in refractive index at a
solid optical surface, which change is caused by the
analyte involving or influencing the binding of a
refractive index enhancing species to the optical surface,
or the release therefrom, respectively.One type of method for determining such refractive
index changes at an optical surface is based upon surface
plasmon resonance, hereinafter SPR. The phenomenon of SPR
is well known. In brief, SPR is observed as a dip in
intensity of light reflected at a specific angle from the
interface between an optically transparent material, e.g.
glass, and a thin metal film, usually silver or gold, and
depends on among other factors the refractive index of the
medium (e.g. a sample solution) close to the metal surface.
A change of refractive index at the metal surface, such as
by the adsorption or binding of material thereto, will
cause a corresponding shift in the angle at which SPR
occurs. To couple the light to the interface such that SPR
arises, two alternative arrangements are used, either a
metallized diffraction grating (Wood's effect), or a
metallized glass prism or a prism in optical contact with a
metallized glass substrate (Kretschmann effect). For
further details on SPR, reference is made to our WO
90/05295. In an SPR-based immunoassay, a ligand may be
bound to the metal surface, and the interaction thereof
with an analyte of an aqueous sample in contact with the
surface is monitored.SPR assays have, however, certain fundamental
limitations which restrict the technical performance
thereof. One major limiting factor is the sensitivity, or
signal strength. The SPR response depends on the volume and
refractive index of the bound analyte, which volume is
limited by mass transfer, reaction-kinetic and equilibrium
parameters. For example, water and diluted aqueous buffers 
have a refractive index of about 1.33, whereas most
proteins have a refractive index in the region of about 1.5
to 1.6. Since the SPR-measurement response is proportional
to the change in refractive index caused when e.g. protein
molecules are adsorbed to the surface and displace water
therefrom, the refractive index difference between the
protein and the buffer solution puts a theoretical limit to
the strength of response that may be obtained. It is thus
understood that SPR-based immunoassays for substances of
low molecular weight or occurring in low concentrations,
like, for
