<ABSTRACT>
The inventive pattern (40) comprises 
a first plurality of vertical bars (404, 406) horizontally 

spaced and a second plurality of horizontal bars (408) 
vertically spaced. The spacing between the bars is 

approximately equal to the width of the bars. In particular 
implementation, the pattern (40) is adapted for use with an 

inkjet printer (10) having a plurality of pens (102, 104, 106, 
108). The first plurality of bars (406) includes a first set 

of bars (420, 422, 424, 426) printed by each of the pens (102, 
104, 106 and 108 respectively). The first plurality of bars 

includes a second set of bars (430, 432, 434, 436, 438, 440) 
printed by one of the pens (102) moving at at least two 

different horizontal speeds. The second plurality of bars 
(408) includes one column of vertically spaced bars (1, 2, 3, 

4) for each of the pens (102, 104, 106, and 108 respectively). 
Each column of vertically spaced bars includes a first 

plurality of vertically spaced bars (1,1; 1,2; 1,3; 1,4; and 
1,5) printed by the first pen (102). A respective column of 

vertically spaced bars (2,2; 2,3; 2,4) includes a second 
plurality of vertically spaced bars (2,2; 2,3; 2,4) printed 

by a respective one of the pens (104, 106, 108). Each column 
of vertically spaced bars (3,1; 3,2; 3,3; 3,4, 3,5) includes 

a third plurality of vertically spaced bars printed by the 

first pen (102). The inventive pattern allows for considerable 
information with respect to pen alignment to be determined by 

optical scanning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printers and
plotters. More specifically, the present invention
relates to inkjet printers and plotters having multiple
pens for multi-color operation.While the present invention is described herein with
reference to illustrative embodiments for particular
applications, it should be understood that the invention
is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in
the art and access to the teachings provided herein will
recognize additional modifications, applications, and
embodiments within the scope of the claims and additional
fields in which the present invention would be of
significant utility.Inkjet printer/plotters, such as those sold by
Hewlett Packard Company, offer substantial improvements
in speed over the conventional X-Y plotter. Inkjet
printer/plotters typically include a pen having an array
of nozzles. The pens are mounted on a carriage which is
moved across the page in successive swaths. Each inkjet
pen has heater circuits which, when activated, cause ink
to be ejected from associated nozzles. As the pen 
is positioned over a given location, a jet of ink is
ejected from the nozzle to provide a pixel of ink at
a desired location. The mosaic of pixels thus created
provides a desired composite image.Inkjet technology is now well known in the art.
See, for example, U. S. Patents Nos. 4,872,027, entitled
PRINTER HAVING IDENTIFIABLE INTERCHANGEABLE HEADS, issued
October 3, 1989, to W. A. Buskirk et al. and 4,965,593,
entitled PRINT QUALITY OF DOT PRINTERS, issued October
23, 1990, to M. S. Hickman.Recently, full color inkjet printer/plotters have
been developed which comprise a plurality of inkjet pens
of diverse colors. A typical color inkjet
printer/plotter has four inkjet pens, one that stores
black ink, and three that store colored inks, e.g.,
magenta, cyan and yellow. The colors from the three
color pens are mixed to obtain any particular color.The pens are typically mounted in stalls within an
assembly which is mounted on the carriage of the
printer/plotter. The carriage assembly positions the
inkjet pens and typically holds the circuitry required
for interface to the heater circuits in the inkjet pens.Full color printing and plotting requires that the
colors from the individual pens be precisely applied to
the media. This requires precise alignment of the
carriage assembly. Unfortunately, mechanical
misalignment of the pens in conventional inkjet
printer/plotters results in offsets in the x direction
(in the media or paper axis) and in the y direction

<CLAIMS>
An inkjet printer or plotter (10) comprising a plurality of
pens or cartridges (102, 104, 106, 108), comprising means

for causing the pens or cartridges to print out a test
pattern having a first plurality of aligned vertical bars

(404, 406) horizontally spaced and a second plurality of
aligned horizontal bars (408) vertically spaced, wherein

the spacing between the bars is approximately equal to the
width of the bars; an optical sensor for optically scanning

the bars of the test pattern to produce information
concerning pen alignment; and means responsive to said

information for correcting subsequent printing operations
by said pens.
The printer or plotter according to claim 1, wherein the
first plurality of bars (404, 406) includes a first set of

bars (420, 422, 424, 426) printed by each of the pens
