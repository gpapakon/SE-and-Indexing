<CLAIMS>
Composite materials produced from fabrics of high-modulus fibre materials or optionally 
in part from other synthetic fibre materials and a binder, wherein the layers of binder are 

arranged essentially only between the layers of fabric, and the binder is a resol modified 
with polyvinyl butyral, 
characterized in that
 the resol content is in the range of from 4 
to 20% by weight and the polyvinyl butyral content is in the range of from 75 to 95% by 

weight. 
A process for producing the composite materials according to Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 a plurality of layers of fabrics coated with the binder are pressed together at temperatures 
in the range of from 140 to 180°C. 
A process for producing the composite materials according to Claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 a plurality of layers of uncoated fabrics, between which a foil of binders is provided 
in each case, are pressed together at temperatures in the range of from 140 to 180°C. 
Use of a binder consisting of from 75 to 95% by weight of polyvinyl butyral, from 4 to 
20% by weight of resol and from 1 to 5% by weight of hardening agent for producing 

composite materials from fabrics of high-modulus fibres which can optionally contain in 
part other synthetic fibres. 
Use of a binder according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 it is in the form of a foil.
