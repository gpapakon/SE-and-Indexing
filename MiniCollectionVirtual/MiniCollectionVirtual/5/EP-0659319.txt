<DESCRIPTION>
 "Telephone Adapter for Telephone Sets"FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to telephony, and particularly to a telephone adaptor (or jack) unit for connecting telephone handsets to a telephone line.A subscriber's telephone line usually includes a number of extensions enabling different handsets to transmit and receive via the same telephone line. Many sophisticated systems are available providing, among a wide variety of various telephone functions, the function of connecting a selected extension to the telephone line, or connecting a plurality of extensions at one time to the telephone line to provide intercommunication between the extensions. However, such known sophisticated systems are generally very complicated and costly, and are therefore generally utilized only by commercial concerns, as distinguished from residential subscribers which may have but a few extensions connected to one telephone line and which do not require many of the functions of a sophisticated system.OBJECTS AND BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a telephone adaptor unit particularly useful 

 by residential subscribers to permit the telephone line to be used for many of the serves now provided by sophisticated, costly telephone systems used by commerical concerns.According to the present invention, there is provided a telephone adaptor unit for a telephone handset connectible, with other like telephone adaptor units for other telephone handsets, between the respective telephone handset and a common telephone line, comprising: an off-hook detector for detecting whether the respective telephone handset is off-hook, on-hook, or momentarily on-hook; a first switching device effective, when the respective off-hook detector detects an off-hook condition, to connect the respective telephone handset to the telephone line and to disconnect the other telephone handsets from the telephone line; an audio circuit including an audio amplifier and speaker connected to the telephone line; a second switching device for enabling the audio circuit to receive audio signals from the telephone line and to reproduce such signals via its speaker; and a control system effective, when actuated, to actuate the first switching device of the other telephone adaptor units to connect their respective telephone handsets to the common telephone line, and to actuate the second switching device of the other telephone adaptor units to enable the audio circuit of the other 

telephone

<CLAIMS>
 WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A telephone adaptor unit for a telephone handset connectible, with other like telephone adaptor units for other telephone handsets, between the respective telephone handset and a common telephone line, comprising: an off-hook detector for detecting whether the respective telephone handset is off-hook, on-hook, or momentarily on-hook; a first switching device effective, when the respective off-hook detector detects an off-hook condition, to connect the respective telephone handset to the telephone line and to disconnect the other telephone handsets from the telephone line; an audio circuit including an audio amplifier and speaker connected to the telephone line; a second switching device for enabling said audio circuit to receive audio signals from the telephone line and to reproduce such signals via its speaker; and a control system effective, when actuated, to actuate said first switching device of the other telephone adaptor units to connect their respective telephone handsets to the common telephone line, and to actuate said second switching device of the other telephone adaptor units to enable said audio circuit of the other telephone adaptor units to receive 


audio signals from the telephone line and to reproduce such signals via their speakers.
2. The telephone adaptor unit according to Claim 1 , wherein said control system includes time delay means effective, upon actuation of the control system, to actuate said first switching devices of the other telephone adaptor units only for a first predetermined time interval, and to actuate said second switching devices of the other telephone adaptor units for a second predetermined time interval.
3. The telephone adaptor unit according to Claim 2 , wherein said control system also includes a line status detector effective, when detecting a momentary "on-hook" condition in any of the telephone adaptor units, to actuate said first switching device for said first predetermined time interval, and said second switching device for said second predetermined time interval.
4. The telephone adaptor unit according to Claim 3, wherein said control system further includes a signal detector connected to the output of said line status detector, a first time delay circuit connected between said signal detector and said first switching device, and a second time delay circuit connected between said signal detector and said second switching device. 


 5. The telephone adaptor unit according to Claim 3, wherein said control system further includes a microprocessor connected between said line status detector and said first and second switching devices.
6. The telephone adaptor unit according to Claim 4, wherein said telephone line normally carries a predetermined voltage, which voltage drops to a lower value when the off-hook detector of one telephone adaptor unit detects an off-hook condition in its respective telephone handset to actuate its first switching device to connect the respective telephone handset to the telephone line, and to disable the first switching devices of the other telephone adaptor units from connecting their respective telephone handsets to the telephone line.
7. A telephone adaptor unit according to Claim 1, wherein said audio circuit includes a power supply, and said second switching device is effective to disable said audio circuit by disconnecting same from its power supply.
