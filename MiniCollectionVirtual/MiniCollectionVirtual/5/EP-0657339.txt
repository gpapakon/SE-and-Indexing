<ABSTRACT>
Rack-and-pinion steering mechanism for motor vehicles comprising 
a rack rod (5), which, controlled by the rotation of pinion (41) 

shifts longitudinally within the body of the gear. Said rack rod 
(5) is supported from one side by a craddle support (6), which, 

through a spring, compresses the teeth of the rod against the 
teeth of the pinion; and on the other side is supported by the 

internal circumference surface (7) of the gear body along the 
whole extension of said surface within which a sliding shoe (8) 

slides fastened to the rack rod (5). The internal circumference 
portion concerned by the sliding of the sliding shoe (8) is the 

supporting element whose position change, at the same rate as the 
shifting made by the rack rod (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rack-and-pinion steering gear for
motor vehicles.In particular, this invention relates to a system of support for
the rack rod in rack-and-pinion steering gears for motor
vehicles.As known, steering gears of the above type comprise a body
housing a pinion and a rack rod, which once it is caused to mesh
with the teeth of the pinion, shifts longitudinally. In its turn,
the pinion is connected to the steering wheel. Of course, the
direction depends on the rotatory movement of the pinion, which
is transmitted by the action exerted on the steering gear of the
motor vehicle. The rack rod is supported in its movement by two
supporting elements which, in their turn, are engaged in the body
of the gear.One of these supports is usually located in correspondence of the
engagememt point between the teeth of the pinion and the teeth of
the rack. This support usually surrounds most of the peripheral
surface of the rack rod opposed to the pinion, preventing the
lateral shifting. Such support, which for a better individuation
shall be called in the following "craddle support", is pushed by
elastic elements (preferably provided with one or several
springs) against the rack rod, so that the teeth of the latter
are always in touch with the teeth of the pinion. In this way,
possible coupling clearances of the teeth due to working
tolerances, or, in time, to wear, cancel one another
systematically. The second support, fixed on the body of the gear on the opposite
side relatively to the side to which the first support is
connected, is usually constituted by a bushing. The connecting
means between the rack rod and the wheels of the vehicle protrude
generally from the ends of the rack rod by means of knuckle
joints.The articulation of said joints is preferably defined on a
spheric element whose centre is located on the same axis as the
rack rod.The structure and the ubication of such type of joint or of other
similar connecting means formed as extensions on the rack axis,
cause the transversal strains to be imperceptible on said rack
rod, limiting in this way the range of the bending moment. This
happens also when the protrusion of the rod relatively to the
bushing or the craddle support has reached the limit of the
maximum steering travel. On the contrary, the case is different
when the connecting elements between the rod and the wheels are
derived from the periphery of said rod through one or more tie-rods
connected to same through means located transversally to its
axis. Such arrangement leads to

<CLAIMS>
A rack-and-piston steering gear for motor vehicles, comprising a
body housing a pinion (4) and a rack road (5), engaged with the teeth

of the pinion, said rack rod (5) shifting longitudinally within said
body and being supported by two supporting elements, the first

supporting element being located in correspondence of the zone of
engagement between the teeth of the pinion (4) and the teeth of the

rack, and pushed by elastic means against the rack rod (5), causing
the teeth of the pinion (4) to adhere continuously to those of the

rack; and the second supporting element being located on the opposite
side relatively to the first one; said rack rod (5) being connected to

the wheel of the motor vehicle by means of tie-rods (15); the body of
the steering gear being composed by a cylinder block (1) and an

extension (2), caused to be integral to one another; the second
supporting element being constituted by a cylindrical sliding shoe (8)

connected to the rack rod (5) and sliding on the internal surface (7)
of extension (2), and tie-rods (15) being fastened to the rack rod (5)

near the sliding shoe (8) by means of bolts (12) and bushings (13),
which slide in a longitudinal opening (16) obtained along the wall of

extension (2); characterized in that the sliding shoe (8) is provided
with one or more peripheral cleft-like grooves (17) which start from

its external peripheral surface and extend in depth in a direction not
directed towards its centre (19); the portions (24) of the sliding 

shoe (8) situated between two consecutive cleft-like grooves (17)
being flexible and slightly strainingly engaging the internal

surface (7) of the extension (2).
The steering gear according to claim 1, wherein the position of the
sliding shoe (8) changes, relatively to the first supporting element,

according to the same rate as the shifting made by the rack rod (5),
and extends on the whole extension of the internal surface (7) of

extension (2), in combination with an equal shifting of the sliding
shoe (8).
The steering gear according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the peripheral
cleft-like grooves (17) are perpendicular to the two sides of the

sliding shoe (8).
The steering gear according to anyone of the preceding claims from
1 to 2, wherein the peripheral cleft-like grooves (17) are diagonal

relatively to the axis (20) of the sliding shoe (8).
The steering gear according to claim 4, wherein the opposite end
points (21,22) of the cleft-like grooves (17) are located

on a line crossing a straight line (23) parallel to the axis (20) of the sliding shoe
(8).
The steering gear according to anyone of the preceding claims,
wherein the sliding shoe (8) is manufactured of plastic material

having a low wear coefficient.
The steering gear according to anyone of the preceding claims,
wherein the rack rod (5) is provided with two rings (27,28) which

define the shifting of the rod or steering travel. 
The steering gear according to anyone of the preceding claims,
wherein a bellows-shroud (31) is connected to the cylinder block (1),
