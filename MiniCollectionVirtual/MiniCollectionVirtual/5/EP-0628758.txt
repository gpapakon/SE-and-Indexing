Float for pipes, in particular of suction dredgers, 
consisting of at least two hollow bodies (1) of plastics 

material which surround the pipe in the form of a sleeve and 
are held together by band-like clamping elements arranged in 

annular grooves (8) on the external surface (5) of the hollow 
bodies (1), wherein axial grooves (7) extending over the 

entire length of the hollow bodies (1) are worked into the 
external surface (5) of the hollow bodies (1). 
Float according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
axial grooves (7) are wedge-shaped. 
Float according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the internal surface (4) of the hollow bodies (1) is provided 

with axial ribs (6) extending over their entire length. 
Float according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
axial ribs (6) have a rectangular cross section. 
Float according to claims 2 and 4, characterised in that 
the axial grooves (7) and axial ribs (6) are offset from one 

another. 
Float according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the bases (9) of the annular grooves (8) 

extend between the axial grooves (7) as plane faces. 
Float according to claim 6, characterised in that one 
respective annular groove (8) is provided in the immediate 

vicinity of each end face (2, 3) of the hollow bodies (1). 
Float according to claim 6 or 7, characterised in that 
the hollow bodies (1) have three annular grooves (8).
