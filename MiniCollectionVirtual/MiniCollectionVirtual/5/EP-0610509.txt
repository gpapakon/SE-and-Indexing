<ABSTRACT>
A method for obtaining hollow forgings by radial forging of continuous blanks, where the generatrix AA of the surface of 
the edge of the continuous blank (1) is oriented along the longitudinal axis CC of the working surface of the pressing block 

head, is swaged in a radial direction by means of at least one pair of the pressing block heads (3) first in one direction with its 
subsequent rotation along its longitudinal axis OO and/or movement in the axial direction OO, is swaged in another radial 

direction at a deformation degree within 3-8 % of the current cross-sectional dimension of the blank (1), as a result of which the 
width of the contact surface equals roughly 0.121-1.124 of said current dimension of the blank (1
).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to the area of mechanical metal-working and deals, in 
particular, with the method of manufacturing hollow forgings by radial forging of solid 
blanks. This method can be used in machine building and metallurgy for manufacturing 
long hollow intermediate products like electric motor shafts, railroad car axles, lathe tail 
spindles, torque transmitting spindles; also pipe intermediate products operating under 
high pressure, for instance, in assemblies of chemical and oil refining installations; as 
well drilling pipes, locks, nipples and so on. There is known a method of forging long solid blanks with the help of radial 
forging machine (see, for instance, an advertisement leaflet of "GFM" company, Austria, 
"Precision forging machines". Copyright 76-09-08/2). By this method the long initial 
blank of round or polyhedral cross-section is heated first then set up into the chuck head 
of manipulator and after that fed into the interspace of the forging tools being 
simultaneously rotated. The blank is swaged simultaneously through four contact surfaces 
from four directions at maximum deformation rate of more than 10% with the use of 
four forging tools moving radially toward each other and to blank's axis. During the 
intervals between swagings, when the forging tools accomplish their back travel, the 
blank is rotated around its longitudinal axis and moved in the axial direction with the 
help of manipulator. When making the next working stroke the forging tools swage other 
portions of the blank and so on. The above mentioned operational cycle is repeated over 
and over swaging the blank full length up to getting required sizes of the final cross-section. 
To prevent the deconsolidation of metal in the axial zone of the blank the 
following forging characteristics (deformation rate and shape of forging tools) are 
chosen: 25,5% when the entrance angle is 15° and 20,5% when the entrance angle is 
5°. The considered method of forging gives an opportunity to obtain forgings with high-precision 
dimensions, dense macrostructure of metal in the axial zone, with the use, to a 
great extent, of automation and control of deformation modes. However, by radial forging of initial solid blank a long solid forging is obtained 
and that means that the above mentioned known method doesn't make it possible to 
obtain a hollow forging. That's why this solid forging should be later subjected to 
machining (deep drilling) to get an axial hole and so on. In those cases when it is nevertheless

Method of obtaining hollow forgings by radial 
forging of solid blanks characterised in that a generatrix 

(AA) of the surface of a cylindrical solid blank (1) 
or the longitudinal edge (BB) of a polyhedral solid blank 

(1) is oriented along the longitudinal axis (CC) of the generally 
flat working surfaces of at least one pair of radially 

opposed forging tools (3), in that the blank (1) is 
swaged in radial direction (D) by said forging tools (3) 

first in one direction, whereupon the blank (1) is turned 
around its longitudinal axis (OO) and/or is moved in axial 

direction, and then is swaged in another radial direction, 
and in that this takes place using a fixed deformation rate 

(ε) for every swaging within 3 - 8% of the current cross-sectional 
dimension (E) of the blank (1) with the result 

that the width (F) of the contact area (4) resulting from 
contact with each forging tool (3) is approximately within 

0.121 - 0.124 of said current cross-sectional dimension (E) 
of the blank (1). 
Method according to claim 1 characterised 
in that after having been moved in axial direction the 

blank (1) is swaged first, then turned, then again swaged 
and moved back in axial direction.  

 
Method according to claims 1 and 2 characterised 
in that several pairs of forging tools (3) are 

employed, and the swaging of the blank (1) is performed, in 
turn, by every pair of forging tools (3). 
Method according to claims 1 and 3 characterised 
in that the turning of the blank (1) and/or its 

movement in axial direction is done after alternate swaging 
by all pairs of forging tools (3). 
Method according to claims 1, 2, 3 and 4

forging temperature in the range of approximately 0.65 - 
0.80 of the melting point for the blank's (1) material on 

the Kelvin scale. 
Method according to claim 5 characterised 
in that the surface of the hot blank (1) is cooled to a 

temperature in the range of approximately 0.50 - 0.55 of 
the melting point for the blank's (1) material on the Kelvin 

scale.
