<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air and water tight carrying
case that is adapted to safely transport a portable work station
and permit the work station to be operated in a hostile
environment while the case is closed.Portable work stations have been commercially available for
several years. More particularly, a personal computer, printer
and various other computer peripherals are packaged within a
carrying case to facilitate the transport and storage of the work
station. Being that the work station is controlled from inside
the carrying case, it is necessary to first open the case (i.e.
raise the lid) to gain access to the appropriate computer
hardware. In the event that the work station has been
transported for use in a hostile environment and the lid of the
carrying case is raised, the hardware inside the case could be
subjected to the adverse effects of moisture, sand, heat, cold
and a corrosive atmosphere. As a consequence of the foregoing,
the stability and reliability of the computer hardware may be
undesirably effected thereby rendering the work station
unsuitable for many data computing and transmitting operations.It would therefore be preferable to have available a rugged,
air and water tight carrying case in which to safely transport
a work station for use in a hostile environment without
subjecting the work station to possible damage. That is to say, 
it would be desirable to be able to operate the work station in
a normal fashion in a non-hostile environment with the lid of the
case open to permit manual access to the computer hardware.
However, it would also be desirable to be able to operate the
work station with the lid of the case closed so as to isolate the
computer hardware from the atmosphere when the carrying case is
transported to a hostile environment.Further details regarding the prior art can be found in
US-A-4 896 776 which relates to a protective case according
to the preamble of claim 1.In general terms, an impact resistant, air and water tight
carrying case is disclosed which corresponds to the characterizing
part of claim 1. Said carrying case is suitable for the safe
transport of a
portable work station of the type having a notebook computer,
printer and other peripherals, such as one or more of a cellular
phone, modem, and internal DC power source. The carrying case
includes a base in which the work station is stored and a lid
that is hingedly attached to the base to be rotated between
closed and opened positions. Located on a bulkhead at an
exterior surface of the carrying

<CLAIMS>
A carrying case (1) comprising a portable work station
including at least a computer, said carrying case

enclosing said work station and including a base (3) for
receiving said work station, a lid (2) movable to opened and

closed positions relative to the base, and a first set of
manually accessible controls (37) located at the interior of said

carrying case and connected to the computer to enable the
computer to be energized when the lid is in the opened position,

   characterized by a second set of manually
accessible controls (15-24) located at an exterior surface of

said carrying case (1) and electrically connected to the computer
to enable the computer to be controlled when the lid (2) of the

carrying case is either in the opened position or in the closed
position at which the computer and the first set of controls (37

are sealed and isolated from the atmosphere
surrounding the carrying case, said second set of manually

accessible controls at the exterior surface of said carrying case
including a power switch (22) to be electrically connected

between a source of power and the computer so as to energize the
computer also when the lid is in the closed position. 
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 1, further
comprising a cover (7) supported at said exterior surface of said

carrying case and movable from a first position at which
to cover said second set of controls (15-24) to a second position

at which to expose said controls and thereby permit
manual access thereto. 
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 1, wherein one
of said second set of controls (15-24) at the exterior surface of

said carrying case is an external parallel port (19) electrically
connected to the computer within said case.
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 1, wherein one
of said second set of controls (15-24) at the exterior surface of

said carrying case is an external serial port (20) electrically
connected to the computer within said case.
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 1, wherein one
of said second set of controls (15-24) at the exterior surface of said

carrying case is an external video port (21) electrically
connected to the computer within said case.
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 1, wherein one
of said second set of controls (15-24) at the exterior surface of

said carrying case is an external keyboard connector (24)
electrically connected to the computer within said case.
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 1, said work
station also including a radio frequency transceiver and

a power source located inside said carrying case and electrically
connected to provide power to said transceiver, one of said second

set off controls (15-24) being an external power switch (23)
connected between the power source inside said case and the

transceiver to control the supply of power from said source to
said transceiver. 
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 7, further
comprising an external antenna jack (25) located on the outside

of said case and manually accessible when the lid (2) of said
case is in the closed position relative to said base, and an

antenna wire (29) located within said case and extending between
said antenna jack and said radio frequency transceiver.
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 1, further
comprising a circuit board (39) carried by the lid (2) and

interconnected with the computer, and at least one backplane
connector (34) electrically connected to said computer via said

circuit board.
The carrying case (1) recited in claim 9, further
comprising a shroud (33) extending across and spaced from the lid

(2), said circuit board (39) located in the space between the lid
and the shroud, and said backplane connector (34) attached to

said circuit board and projecting outwardly from said shroud
through a slot formed therein.
