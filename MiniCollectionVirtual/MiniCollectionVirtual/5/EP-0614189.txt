non-plastic panels (22a,22b,28a) and a holder (14) formed of 

plastic disposed on one of the panels (22b) for receiving and 
maintaining a recording medium thereon. At least one panel 

(22a,28a) is configured and dimensioned to removably receive 
printed matter therein. The one panel (22b) additionally 

defines at least one lateral spine (80) visible when the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a storage package for a
recording medium, such as a compact disc, and more particulary
to such a storage package which is formed of a plurality of non-plastic
panels and a plastic holder.The term "recording medium" as used herein and in the claims
broadly encompasses any medium on which information may be
digitally recorded, regardless of whether the recorded data
represents text, images, audio, video, binary data, or
combinations thereof. The common recording media are compact
discs (CD's) which in turn encompass a wide variety of digitally
encoded recording media including the common CD (with an outer
diameter of 4.7 inches), smaller versions thereof (including the
mini - and micro-discs) as well as larger versions thereof, and
CD-ROM's, whether blank or prerecorded, and whether read only or
read/write in nature.A storage package for a recording medium is disclosed in DE-U-91
03114.1 having the features of the pre-characterising position
of Claim 1. In addition,
US-A-5,205,405, US-A-5,219,417
and US-A-5,188,230 disclose
storage packages for a recording medium. The disclosures of the
aforementioned specifications are incorporated herein by reference
as fully as if they were set our herein.Each of the three storage packages disclosed in the above US
Patent Specifications comprises a plurality of non-plastic
(typically paperboard) panels moveable between an open
orientation enabling access to the contents of the package and
a collapsed orientation for storage purposes. The plurality of
panels includes a pair of end panels and optionally one or more
panels intermediate the end panels. Each of the panels has a
generally planar and a generally rectangular panel body, a pair
of opposed transverse panel ends, and a pair of opposed lateral
panel sides. The storage package additionally comprises a holder
formed of plastic disposed on one of the panels for receiving and
maintaining thereon a recording medium such as a compact disc
(CD). The holder has a generally planar and generally
rectangular holder body, a pair of opposed lateral holder sides,
and a pair of opposed transverse holder ends.More particularly, in the storage package of US-A-5 205 405,
the holder includes a tray adapted to releasably
receive the recording medium thereon and a base in telescopic
relation with the tray. The holder is 
movable from a spanning configuration wherein the base and the
tray are substantially untelescoped to a telescoped
configuration wherein the base and the tray are substantially
overlyin

<CLAIMS>
A storage package for a recording medium comprising:

a plurality of non-plastic panels (12) including a pair of end
panels, (12a, 12b) said plurality of panels (12) being moveable

between an open orientation enabling access to the contents of
the package and a collapsed orientation for storage purposes,

each of said panels (12) having a generally planer and generally
rectangular panel body, a pair of opposed transverse panel ends

(18) and a pair of opposed lateral panel sides (19); and a holder
(14) formed of plastic disposed on one of said panels for

receiving and maintaining a recording medium thereon, said holder
(14) having a generally planar and generally rectangular holder

body (40), a paid of opposed lateral holder sides (50), and a
pair of opposed transverse holder ends;

is characterised in that said holder (14) is releaseably secured
to said one panel (12b) and easily removable therefrom.
The package of Claim 1 additionally including releasable
locking means (70, 72), operative when said plurality of panels

(12) is in said collapsed orientation, to preclude accidental
movement of said plurality of panels (12) out of said collapsed

orientation, said releasable locking means (70, 72) being
releasably secured to said one panel (12a) and easily removable

therefrom.
The package of Claim 2 wherein said releasable locking means
(70, 72) is releasably secured to said one panel (12a) without

the use of glue.
The package of any one of Claims 1-3 wherein said holder
(14) is releasably secured to said one panel (12b) without the

use of glue.
The package of any one of Claims 1-4 wherein said one panel
(12b) defies a series of panel apertures (81) adjacent each of

its lateral panel sides, said holder body (40) defines adjacent
each of 

its lateral holder sides (50) a series of laterally spaced first
mating elements, and said holder additionally includes a pair of

lateral extensions (83), each said lateral extension (83) being
pivotally secured to a respective lateral holder side (50) and

defining a series of laterally spaced second mating elements (84)
releasably engageable with said series of first mating elements

(86), each said lateral extension (83) being pivotable between
a non-engaging orientation wherein said series of first (84) and

second (86) mating elements are spaced from each other to permit
removal of said one panel (12b) from said holder (14) and an

engaging orientation wherein one of said series of first and
second mating elements (84, 86) extends through said panel

apertures (81) and releasably engages the other of said series
