<ABSTRACT>
A seat comprising a base mount (1) which supports an adjustable backrest (2) and a seat cushion (3) whose rear part is pivotally supported by the backrest (2) and whose forward part has a supportive part (31, 33; 12) which is displaceably carried by the base mount (1), wherein the arrangement is such that the bottom part of the backrest (2) and the seat cushion (3) are moved forwards relative to the base mount (1) as the backrest (2) is inclined rearwardly from an upright position. The backrest (2) has firmly connected thereto a frame structure (4) which extends in beneath the seat cushion (3); in that the frame structure (4) is displaceably carried by a support (5', 5"; 5, 6, 8, 9) mounted on the base mount (1) and has a guide (10) which coacts with the support (5', 5"; 5) and which in the upright position of the backrest (2) extends generally rearwards and upwards; and in that a supporting arrangement (23, 6, 7, 8, 13) connected to the base mount (1) supports the front supporting part (31, 33; 12) of the seat cushion (3) for movement along a predetermined movement path (23) and in that the guide (10) and the movement path (23) have extensions such that the height of the front edge of the seat cushion (3) above the floor will be held generally constant or will decrease as the backrest (2) is swung from its upright position to a rearwardly inclined position.

<DESCRIPTION>
A Cha±rThe present invention relates to a seat construction of the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1 (see for instance EP-A-0,248,418, Figures 12-14).A seat construction of the kind in which the lower part of the backrest and the seat cushion are pushed forwards as the backrest is inclined rearwardly from an upright position is, among other things, desirable in collective passenger transport vehicles, such as buses, coaches and railway carriages, for instance, so that when inclined rearwardly, the backrest will not encroach unduly on the space intended for the person seated immediately there- behind with his/her backrest raised to an upright posi¬ tion.An object of the present invention is to provide a novel, advantageous seat of the aforesaid kind with which the aforesaid desired movement pattern can be achieved with the aid of simple, inexpensive devices which take-up only little space and which afford stable connection between the seat base-mount, the seat back¬ rest and the seat cushion.This object is achieved with a seat constructed in accordance with the following Claim 1.Further developments of the seat are defined in the depending Claims.The invention enables the devices required for adjusting the position of the seat to be given a very simple, constructive form and to be placed beneath the seat cushion in a manner which will have minimum encroachment on the seating space. The inventive seat may be of the 

kind which includes a base mount which carries an ad¬ justable backrest, a seat cushion whose rear part is pivotally supported by the backrest and whose forward part has a supporting part which is dispiaceably carried by the base mount, wherein the arrangement is such that the bottom part of the backrest and the seat cushion are moved forwards in relation to the base mount as the backrest is moved rearwardly from an upright position (EP-A-0,248,418, Figures 12-14), and against this back- ground the seat is characterized in that the backrest has firmly connected thereto a frame structure which extends in beneath the seat cushion; in that the frame structure is movably supported by a support means on the base mount; in that the frame structure has guide means which coact with the support means and which extend essentially obliquely rearwards and upwards in the upright position of the backrest; in that the forward support part of the seat cushion carries a support means which is connected to the base mount and intended for movement along a predetermined path; and in that the extensions of

Claims
1. A seat comprising a base mount (1) which supports an a justable backrest (2) and a seat cushion (3) whose rear part is pivotally supported by the backrest (2) and whose forward part has a supportive part (31, 33; 12) which is dispiaceably carried by the base mount (1) , wherein the arrangement is such that the bottom part of the backrest (2) and the seat cushion (3) are moved forwards relative to the base mount (1) as the backrest (2) is inclined rearwardly from an upright position, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the backrest (2) has firmly connected thereto a frame structure (4) which extends in beneath the seat cushion (3) ; in that the frame structure (4) is dispiaceably carried by a support (5', 5"; 5, 6, 8, 9) mounted on the base mount (1) and has a guide (10) which coacts with the support (5', 5"; 5) and which in the upright position of the backrest (2) extends generally rearwards and upwards; and in that a supporting arrangement (23, 6, 7, 8, 13) connected to the base mount (1) supports the front supporting part (31, 33; 12) of the seat cushion (3) for movement along a predetermined movement path (23); and in that the guide (10) and the movement path (23) have extensions such that the height of the front edge of the seat cushion (3) above the floor will be held generally constant or will decrease as the backrest (2) is swung from its upright position to a rearwardly inclined position.
2. A seat according to Claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the support arrangement (23) and the supporting part (31, 33) coacting therewith include a guide path (23) and a runner (31, 33) coacting there- with. 


3. A seat according to Claim 2, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the guide path (23) is firmly mounted on the base mount (1) ; and in that the runner (31, 33) is connected to the seat cushion (3).
4. A seat according to Claim 2 or 3, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the runner includes a roller (33) which runs along the guide path (23).
5. A seat according to Claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the support which coacts with the guide (10) includes two mutually separate roller pairs (52, 53) on the base mount (l), said guide (10) running between the rollers (52, 53) of respective roller pairs.
6. A seat according to Claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the support arrangement (6, 7, 8, 13) includes at least one arm (6) which with the aid of one first end-part (7) supports the seat cushion (3) in a forward region thereof, and which is pivotally carried by the base mount (1) at its opposite end-part (8); in that said support part is an abutment surface (13) which is arranged on the seat cushion (3) and which coacts with a supporting surface (13) on the aforesaid first end-part (7) of the arm (6) ; in that the supporting surface (13) and the abutment surface (12) are in con¬ stant abutment with one another along a limited region whose position is dependent on the position to which the arm (6) is swung; in that the support is formed partly by virtue of the fact that the front region of the frame structure (4) is supported by the arm (6) and pivotally connected to said arm at a point between the mutually opposite end-parts thereof; and in that the arm has different pivotal positions when the backrest is in its upright position and when the backrest is in a rear¬ wardly inclined position, and also by virtue of the fact 



that the guide rail (10) rests dispiaceably against a supportive projection carried by the base mount (1).
7. A seat according to Claim 6, c h a r a c - t e r i z e d in that the arm (6) has a forwardly angled first end-part (7) which includes a generally upwardly facing convex support surface (13) which coacts with a preferably flat abutment surface.
