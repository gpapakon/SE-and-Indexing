<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to business intelligence systems and in
particular to an integrated data warehouse system.Many large organizations use enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to
consolidate day-to-day transaction data and streamline business functions such as
manufacturing. With their predefined, standard reporting capabilities, however, these
ERP systems are not optimized to support the flexible, ad hoc business analysis and
reporting businesses need to make strategic decisions and improve business
performance. Furthermore, ERP systems are not intended to serve as e-business
analysis and reporting infrastructures.For example, generating a report from an ERP system that shows product line
sales by region,by sales person for the past five years would typically be quite time-consuming.
With their multitude of tables, fields, and column names, ERP systems
are not well suited to end-user navigation. Without easy information access, and the
means to quickly analyze and report on findings, users can overlook important
business correlations or veer off-track completely. Ultimately, the quality and speed
of decision-making suffer.In addition, if hundreds or thousands of users were to submit queries directly,
ERP system performance would be impacted, jeopardizing important production
system functions. This, along with the risks associated with giving the extended e-business
enterprise direct access to ERP systems, necessitates placing ERP data into
an environment that is not only optimized for business analysis and reporting, but also
for secure broad access. Seeking predictable performance and desiring to give users
all the information they need quickly, many companies opt to build either data
warehouses or data marts.Companies which have strived to develop decision support systems that would
support rich analysis and reporting realized that operational reporting systems (e.g.,
ERP systems) were limited in scope and the depth of insight they delivered. While 
optimized for consolidating day-to-day transaction data and streamlining key business
functions, these systems offer but a fraction of the reporting and analysis capabilities
users need to fully comprehend what drives business performance.Many companies turned to developing data warehouses to fill the requirement
for consolidating data from across the organization, with a single consistent historical
view, and designed for optimized reporting and analysis. The ultimate objective of
these systems was to ensure that the data needed to
