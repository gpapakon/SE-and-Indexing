<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high active surfactant
paste composition and to high active granular detergent
components and compositions which can be made using such
paste compositions. The invention also relates to a process
for making these pastes, and granular components and
compositions.In recent years there has been a trend towards making
granular detergents having a higher bulk density than
before. Various techniques of making dense granular
detergents, and of processing low density granular
detergents in such a way that the bulk density is
increased, have been described. One example of a suitable
technique for making dense granular detergents is known as 
"agglomeration". This term describes any process in which
small particles of the components are processed in such a
way that they are built-up (or "agglomerated") to form
suitable granular components.The ideal detergent agglomerate should have a high bulk
density and a high surfactant content and yet still have
good solubility and dispersion properties. It should also
be possible to use a manufacturing process which is both
efficient and versatile.Different approaches to these objectives have been made in
the prior art.US-A-5 080 848, published on 14th January, 1992 describes a
process for making surfactant granules typically having an
anionic surfactant activity of 50% to 75% (see examples 1
to 8). The process involves chilling and granulating a
viscous high active surfactant paste. The granulation may
be performed with the aid of some detergency builders (see
examples 3 and 4), but the emphasis is on reducing the
temperature in order to initiate granulation. The finished
detergent composition may contain other optional
ingredients including chelating agents, but there is no
indication of any advantages of adding solutions of
chelating agent and polymers directly to the paste.EP-A-0 508 543, published on 14th October, 1992 discloses
methods of chemically conditioning high active surfactant
pastes in order to achieve high active detergent granules.
Phosphonates, polymers and copolymers are disclosed as
useful conditioning agents. Conditioning of a paste may be
achieved by, for example, increasing paste viscosity and/or
drying.
An example of paste conditioning by the addition of
powdered co-polymer is given. However there is no 
suggestion of the benefits of using solutions of chelant
and polymer together.The prior art suggests that in order to maximise the
surfactant activity it is necessary to minimise the amount
of water in the surfactant
