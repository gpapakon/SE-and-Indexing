<ABSTRACT>
Three new HIV-1 isolates HIV-1D747 (ECACC V92082718), HIV-1D757 (ECACC V92082719) and HIV-1D760 (ECACC V92082720) are disclosed, which represent a further indenpendent subtype of the HIV-1 family and have been recovered from Indian patients which at the time when the virus was isolated showed no typical AIDS symptoms. Also disclosed are vaccines against HIV-1 infections by this subtype and a process for producing the same, as well as the use of the HIV-1 isolates to produce protective vaccines against HIV-1 infections and for therapeutical use after HIV-1 infection, as well as for differential diagnosis.

<CLAIMS>
The virus isolate HIV-1
D747
 (ECACC V92082718),

the virus isolate HIV-1
D757
 (ECACC V92082719), and

the virus isolate HIV-1
D760
 (ECACC V92082720).
A vaccine against HIV-1 virus infections of the Indian
subtype defined by the virus isolates according to claim

1, characterized by being prepared from the virus
HIV-1
D757
, the virus HIV-1
D747
 and/or the virus HIV-1
D760
.
A vaccine according to claim 2, containing as the active
ingredient the peptides

MPNGTKSNS, MPNGTKGNS, MPNGTKSNL,

RNEKDLLALDSWKN,

peptides from the CD4-binding region comprising an additional
glycosylation site immediately in front of cysteine

450 (relative to the prototype HIV-1
Lai
), or

combinations of said peptides.
The vaccine according to claim 2, characterized in that
the peptides are produced by chemical synthesis and are

optionally chemically modified.
The vaccine against HIV-1 virus infections according to
claim 2, containing as the active ingredient peptides from

variable regions of HIV-1
D757
, HIV-1
D747
 and/or HIV-1
D760

which do not occur in the other HIV-1 subtypes. 
The vaccine according to claims 2 to 5, characterized by
being used as an immunotherapeutic agent after infection.
A process for producing a vaccine according to claims 2 to
5, characterized in that the viruses HIV-1
D757
, HIV-1
D747

and/or HIV-1
D760
 are employed.
A process for producing a passive vaccine against HIV-1
virus infections of the Indian subtype defined by the virus

isolates according to claim 1, characterized by being
prepared from antibodies against the viruses HIV-1
D757
,
HIV-1
D747
 and/or HIV-1
D760
.
Use of the virus isolates HIV-1
D757
, HIV-1
D747
 and/or
HIV-1
D760
 according to claim 1 for producing a vaccine for
protection against HIV-1 virus infections and for producing

vaccines for therapeutic use after HIV-1 infection.
Use of the virus isolates according to claim 1 for differential
diagnostics between HIV-1 viruses of different subtypes.
