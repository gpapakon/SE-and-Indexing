<ABSTRACT>
A mobile, motor-driven apparatus (1) for the specific, controlled and water-saving irrigation of spaced-apart plants, such as trees, bushes, boxes and tubs of flowers etc. and adjacent green areas and parkland, is composed of a front spraying unit (7), of a rear spraying unit (18) and of a spraying unit (50) aligned to the sides of the vehicle (1), these all being configured such that they can be lengthened (7'') as extension arms, can rotate about their own axis and can pivot horizontally. They are of tubular design and are thus themselves water-channelling. The operation of the units (7,18,50) is controlled and monitored via a control point (5), operating as a computer, in the driver's cab (2), all the movable operating units such as pump (20), valves (21-27), movement of spraying units (7,18,50) and positioning thereof on or above the plant (10) are controlled exclusively by the computer in the control point (5). For the precise adjustment of all the process conditions and effects which can be achieved by the apparatus, the novel apparatus also makes use, in particular, of the satellite locating system which is known per se.

Apparatus for selective water-saving irrigation of plants, 
which are spaced from one another, such as trees, shrubs, 

potted plants or plants in tubs, as well as neighbouring 
lawns and beds, which plants are to be found on paths, roads 

or avenues or in urban constructions, for example, for decreasing 
traffic or forming path boundaries, 

comprising a motor-driven vehicle (1) with a driver's cabin 
(2) and, behind the cabin, a water tank (4), as well as a 

movable pivoted arm (7) arranged at the front end of the vehicle, 
the pivoted arm cyrrying a spray unit (8,8') at its 

end, the pivoted arm consisting of pipe-like water carrying 
parts which are connected by articulated joints (7''') 

characterised in the combination of the following features: 

(a) the pivoted arm (7) with the spray unit (8,8'7 is located 
at the height of the front frame of the vehicle (1) 

in front of the driver's cabin;
 
it is hydraulically and telescopically movable up and 

down (7') as well as being pivotable in a horizontal 
plane (62,63);
 
the articulated joints (7''') consist of massive totatable 

connectors for ensuring unhindered water flow;
 
the pivoted arm (7) can rest towards the rear on the 

tank (4) or on the driver's cabin (2); 
(b) a second spray unit (18) is located at the rear region 
of the vehicle (1), for example on the vehicle's guidance 

system, the second spray unit being hydraulically and 
telecopically movable up and down and also pivotable in 

a horizontal plane in a similar manner to the front unit; 
(c) a third spray unit (50) is located on the tank (4) or on 
the driver's cabin (2), the third spray unit being able 

to effect all the movements of the units (8,8';18) towards 
the side of the vehicle (1) 
 
whereby all the pipe-like parts of the pivoted arms and each 

spray unit (8,8'; 18; 50) are mounted to be rotatable about  
 

their own longitudinal axis and lead to a spray head and 
all movable parts of the apparatus, these being the vehicle 

driving motor, the pump (20), the multiway valves (21,22,23, 
24,25,26,27) as well as the moving elements of the spray 

units (8,8';18;50) are included within and controlled by a 
control system. 
Apparatus according to claim 1
 
characterised in that the spray units (8,8';18;50) lead to, 

at their ends, a circular spray head, a flat spray head, a 
watering jet or a multiarmed jet. 
Apparatus according to claim 2
 
characterised in that a propellor or blade, driven by the 

water stream, is arranged inside the jets. 
Apparatus according to claims 1 - 3
 
characterised in that a measuring tank (14) is arranged on 

the tank (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 4
 
characterised in that an additive container (17) is arranged 

on the tank (4). 
Apparatus according to claims 1 - 5
 
characterised by a control system operated by a computer. 
Use of an apparatus according to claims 1 - 6 for selective 
completely automatic and completely continous loss-free 

irrigation of plants, which are spaced from one another, such 
as trees, shrubs, potted plants or plants in tubs, as well 

as neighbouring lawns. 
Use of a known satellite location system for regulating and 
controlling the data of an on-board computer, for example 

the switching of the pump, valve and positioning systems of 
the individual components according to the apparatus of 

claims 1 - 6.
