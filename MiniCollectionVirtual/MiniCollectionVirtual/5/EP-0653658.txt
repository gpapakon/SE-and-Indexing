<ABSTRACT>
Optical apparatus that condenses illuminating light into a narrow 
formatted band of light that follows activated lines down a 

light valve (11) as it is driven. The present invention is a 
telecentric illumination scanning system (10) that comprises 

an input lens group (12), a rotatable or oscillating reflective 
scanner (16), an output lens group (14) and a polarizing element 

(17). The input lens group (12) transmits light provided by 
a light source (13) to the scanner (16), which is reflected 

therefrom and is directed to the output lens group (14). The 
light transmitted by the output lens group (14) is polarized 

by the polarizing element (17) and applied to the light valve 
(11). The input and output lens groups (12, 14) focus the light 

provided by the light source (13) into a relatively narrow band 
of light that is scanned by the rotatable or oscillating scanner 

(16) across the face of the light valve (11). A telecentric 
light zone (21) is formed in a predetermined space between the 

output lens group (14) and the light valve (11). Scanning is 
accomplished by varying the angle of the bundle of chief rays 

at the aperture stop. The scanned illumination may be synchronized 
with the imaging processes of the light valve (11). The 

present invention thus eliminates illumination from the areas 
of the light valve (11) that are not activated during or between 

video frames and greatly increases the light output and contrast 
of a light valve ype projector system (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telecentric illumination
scanning system for illuminating a light valve, said system
comprising: said light valve, a light source, an input lens group that is adapted to transmit
light provided by said light source, a scanner optically coupled
to the input lens group that is adapted to receive the light
transmitted thereby and transmit light therefrom, an output
lens group optically coupled to the scanner for focusing light
transmitted by the scanner onto the light valve.Such a telecentric illumination scanning system is known
from EP-A-0 492 721. One current technique for illuminating liquid crystal light valve based projection
systems, used by an affiliate and assignee of the present invention, is a continuous full
frame, full aperture illumination system, wherein light is relayed or directed to a light
valve in a telecentric or near-telecentric manner. The light valve is activated by writing
a video frame one line at a time on the back of the light valve (for a reflective photoconductive
light valve) or in pixel blocks (e.g. 64 at a time) for a matrix type transmissive
or reflective light valve.Prior art systems include refractive scanning systems in which several cylindrical
lenses are placed around the periphery of a disk and thereby scan by bending the
light path. Each lens covers a percentage of the light valve depending upon the number
of lenses, or the shape of the refractive surface (i.e., one continuous lens as opposed to
multiple lenslets). This approach is very sensitive to eccentricity of rotation. Another
approach incorporates a refractive cube that rotates about an axis perpendicular to transparent
cube faces. This approach uses a well-known principle of axis displacement due
to a tilted parallel plate. In accordance with this principle

where t is the thickness of the plate or cube,  is the angle tilted, and n is the index of
refraction of the plate or cube. Both approaches are sensitive to chromatic effects, and
other aberrations. With the cube approach the aberrations of all rays (that is, the cone
rays), other than chief rays, vary as the angle varies in rotation. Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide for a telecentric
illumination scanning system for illuminating liquid crystal light valves that overcomes
the limitations of the prior art scanning systems.The present invention is a telecentric illumination scanning system that comprises
an input lens group that is adapted to transmit light provided by a light source to
