<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a simulator, more
particularly, to a simulator with which one predicts and
confirms various living environments mainly by visual
perception and further by auditory perception when planning a
house.Today, requests for houses vary from individual to
individual depending on a house one wants.
Housing equipment such as an air conditioner has rapidly
advanced and the performance has been upgraded. In particular,
a so-called housing-air-conditioner (an air conditioner
furnished with a house as one unit) has spread widely. In this
case, the housing equipment must be selected at the time of
planning. Further, there has been an increasing need to fully
consider lighting environments created by the location of a TV
set and a desk besides windows, lighting equipment, etc.On the other hand, people are highly amenity-oriented
these days (amenity means comfort given by places, air-conditioning,
visual perception, etc). For this reason, there
has been a need for a housing plan that fully utilizes a
limited space to quickly provide satisfactory living 
environments in which an internal space looks excellent and
residents feel good and comfortable both mentally and
physically.These are important not only when building new houses
but also when repairing houses.Also, these have become important for places where a
plurality of people work in or use such as shops, offices, etc.However, it is expensive to employ a conventional
experimental method using a miniature to plan optimal
individual houses to satisfy various requests from users or
owners, particularly in Europe, America, and Japan where
laboring costs are high. Further, it is difficult, in
practice, to respond quickly to their requests. Given these
circumstances, a computer technology which has rapidly advanced
in recent years has been adopted to perform an evaluation on
3-D (three-dimensional) living environments by producing
virtual living environments. This enables a quick, inexpensive
evaluation on the air-conditioning, lighting, sound, etc. This
is a so-called computer simulation. Moreover, the simulator
enables one to easily experience a simulation in a realistic
way by producing a virtual space called a virtual reality using
the simulation result.
Reviews of existing virtual reality simulators are given in "The Virtual Dimension" by Clive
Davidson, Image Processing, Winter 1991 and in "The Electronic Library Manager's Guide
to Virtual Reality" by David Raitt, The Electronic Library, Vol. 9, No.1, February 1991. Thus, a massive
