<ABSTRACT>
A method of positioning an E-O probe applied to an 
apparatus for the measurement of voltage. In the first 

step, the relative position of the E-O probe against the 
magnifying optical system in the first condition of being 

focused on the base of the 
E-O probe, and the focal distance difference between the 

focal plane of the magnifying optical system in the 
second condition that the E-O probe is substantially out 

of the optical path for observation of the surface of the 
device and the focal plane in the first condition ar
e 
stored. The relative position and the focal point 

difference are fixed in the apparatus for the measurement 
of voltage regardless of the device to be measured. Next, 

in the second step, the focus of the magnifying optical 
system is adjusted to the observation position of the 

surface of the device in the second condition, and then in 
the third step, the magnifying optical system, the E-O 

probe, and the probe stage are separated from the device 
by the focal point difference stored in the first step by 

the Z-axis stage, and in the fourth step, the E-O probe is 
moved to the relative position of the E-O probe stored in 

the first step relative to the magnifying optical system 
by the probe stage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of positioning an apparatus
comprising an objective lens and an electrooptic probe at a sample to be
measured and to an electrooptic measuring apparatus.One possible feature of an apparatus for the measurement of voltage is
an electrooptic probe (E-O) which comprises an electro-optic crystal the
refractive index of which is varied when the voltage is applied. If the voltage
is applied to a device to be measured while the E-O probe is close to the
device, an electric field in the electro-optic crystal is varied, whereby the
refractive index of the crystal is varied. At this point, if light (laser beam)
enters into the E-O probe, the state of the light polarization is varied by a
change of the refractive index of the crystal in accordance with the applied
voltage. Accordingly, if the light which is reflected by a base of the probe and
comes back to is taken out by a polarization beam splitter through a wave 
plate, a change of the applied voltage can be detected as a change of the light
intensity. Here, a laser source for the measurement may be a continuous wave
(CW) source or a pulsed source.The detecting sensitivity of the apparatus for the measurement of the
voltage depends on the distance between the E-O probe and the device to be
measured. Accordingly, it is important to set the distance accurately. A
solution in a conventional case is, for example, to use a double-focus lens
disclosed in the following reference
"J.Appl.Phys.66(9), 1 November 1989 pp. 4001-4009", or to use a
balance disclosed in the following reference"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND
MEASUREMENT, VOL. 41, NO. 3, JUNE 1992, pp. 375-380".However, in the former conventional case, an E-O probe can be
positioned without contact with the device to be measured, but there is one
fault that a special lens which is a double-focus lens is required. Further, in
the latter conventional case, in order to set the position of the E-O probe, the
E-O probe is brought into contact with the device to be measured once to
obtain the reference position, and based on the reference position, the position
of the E-O probe is determined. In this case, its structure is very complicated
to decrease the damage due to the contact. Specifically, the E-O probe is 
needed to be fixed at the cylinder which can move up and down in the state of
small friction with air blows between a cylinder and an air guide, and their
effective mass is reduced by the balance system. Moreover, the slight vertical
movement of the E-O probe is
