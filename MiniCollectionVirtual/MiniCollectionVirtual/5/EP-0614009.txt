<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum pump comprises a body (11,12) having a 
cylinder liner (16) therein which defines an exhaust passage 

between the outer wall of the liner and the inner wall of 
the body. The exhaust passage which may include restrictors 

(20,21), permits the spaces (37,38) in the interior of the 
body to be used as silencer chambers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vacuum pumps and is 
particularly concerned with reducing exhaust noise thereof. Vacuum pumps, particularly small high speed vacuum 
pumps, can be very noisy in operation. Most noise emanates 
from the exhaust area and is a result of air being pumped 
out in a series of rapid undamped blasts. It is possible 
to fit a silencer to the exhaust port, but such silencers 
increase the pump cost and may add to the overall pump size 
at a time when manufacturers are seeking to minimise size 
cost and material content as much as possible. High speed electrically driven vacuum pumps for 
vehicles pose particular problems since it is essential that 
such pumps are very quiet in operation yet take up the 
minimum space possible. Such pumps should be adaptable to 
many different installation sites yet be of a common 
reliable and economical design. Above all such pumps must 
not be unduly expensive.  
 FR-A-1529380 discloses a piston compressor having 
noise muffling chambers for the inlet and outlet ducts and 
disposed generally either side of the working bore. DE-A-3231957 discloses a piston compressor having an 
annular chamber around the working bore and constituting 
part of the inlet duct. The annular chamber is supplied 
from the exterior of the pump and includes a small aperture 
to permit oil to drain to the crankcase. According to the invention there is provided a vacuum 
pump having a body, a crankcase a cylinder liner in the body 
defining a pumping bore, a piston reciprocal in the bore, 
inlet valve means and outlet valve means characterized in 
that, at least one exhaust passage is provided through said 
body between said cylinder liner and the body said exhaust 
passage extending from the outlet valve means into the 
crankcase. Such an arrangement allows the crankcase volume to be  
 
utilised as a damping chamber; said passage may include flow 
restrictors to achieve a desired silencing effect. The pump body may include partitions to divide said 
body into several chambers of relatively large volume; such 
volumes may constitute a plurality of damping chambers 
linked by flow restricting orifices. This arrangement is 
particularly convenient where the body is a die cast or 
plastics moulding having internal walls to support e.g. an 
electric motor. The exhaust outlet to atmosphere may be arranged at 
any convenient point on the pump body, and the flow path of 
exhaust air designed accordingly. In this way the pump may 
be adapted to a wide variety of installation sites. The

<CLAIMS>
A vacuum pump having a body (11,12), a crankcase 
(37) a cylinder liner (16) in the body defining a pumping 

bore (22), a piston (23) reciprocal in the bore, inlet valve 
means (31) and outlet valve means (32) characterized in 

that, at least one exhaust passage is provided through said 
body (11,12) between said cylinder liner (16) and the body 

(11,12) said exhaust passage extending from the outlet valve 
means (32) into the crankcase (37). 
A pump according to claim 1 wherein said passage 
includes a flow restrictor (20). 
A pump according to claim 1 or claim 2 and having 
at least one internal wall (27) downstream of said exhaust 

passage and defining exhaust chambers (37,38) on either side 
thereof, and at least one aperture (39) in the wall. 
A pump according to any preceding claim wherein 
the radially outer surface of the liner (16) is polygonal. 
A pump according to claim 4 wherein the polygonal 
apices of said liner (16) are an interference fit in said 

body (11,12). 
A pump according to claim 4 or claim 5 wherein 
radially outer surface of said liner (16) is polygonal over 

a portion of its length only. 
A pump according to claim 6 wherein said portion 
is substantially midway between the ends of the liner (16). 
A pump according to claim 7 wherein said liner 
further includes a radially extending flange (19)  

 
substantially at one end thereof, said flange being a close 

fit in said body and having one or more apertures (21) 
therein. 
A pump according to any preceding claim wherein 
said liner is of plastics material.
