<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a rotary electric machine, such as an 
alternating current generator for vehicles, which can increase 

cooling flow quantity and reduce whizzing sound. In this rotary 
electric machine, cooling wind blown from a centrifugal fan (6, 

60) flows into a numerosity of cooling windows (w) which surround 
the centrifugal fan (6, 60). The cooling windows (w) are 

separated in the circumferential direction by support parts (8) 
or guide wall parts (7). The angle (ϑ) of inclination of the 

guide wall part (7) against the radial direction is set to be 
larger in the vicinity of the forward end (a) of the support part 

(8) in the rotating direction and smaller in the vicinity of the 
backward end (b) of the support part (8) in the rotating 

direction to increase the cooling flow quantity. Furthermore, the 
circumferential widths (H) of the cooling windows (w) are set to 

be narrower in the vicinity of the support part (8) and wider in 
the distance from the support part (8) to increase the cooling 

flow quantity. Moreover, the axial length of the cooling window 
(w) is set to become gradually longer from the vicinity of the 

support part (8) towards the intermediate area between the 
support parts (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a rotary 
electric machine such as an alternating current generator for 
vehicles and, more particularly, to a cooling mechanism of such 
rotary electric machine. As an example of conventional rotary electric machines, 
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 3-178593 discloses an 
alternating current generator as illustrated in Fig. 8 and corresponding to the preamble of claim 1. This 
alternating current generator includes a housing 100 with a 
plurality of cooling windows w opened in a cylindrical peripheral 
wall thereof in circumferential alignment, and a centrifugal 
fan 106 positioned inside the cooling windows w and fixed to the 
end of a rotor (not illustrated) in the housing 100. The 
peripheral wall of the housing 100 has guide wall parts 102, each 
of which is positioned between circumferentially adjacent two of 
the cooling windows w and extends axially. Each guide wall part 
102 is inclined at a constant angle  against the radial 
direction, so that the cooling wind blown out of the cooling 
windows w is blown out in this inclined direction. Between the 
two circumferentially adjacent cooling windows w, 
support parts 103 extend axially and the circumferential width 
of each support part 103 is made to be wider than the 
circumferential width of the guide wall part 102. In the above conventional rotary electric machine, the 
support parts 103 result in large fluid resistances against  
 
cooling wind generated by the centrifugal fan 106, causing 
increase in fluid loss, decrease in cooling ability or increase 
in whizzing sound. It is an object of the present invention to solve the 
above problem by providing a rotary electric machine which can 
increase the cooling flow quantity without any further addition 
of power. It is a further object of the present invention to reduce 
whizzing sound in the rotary electric machine. According to one aspect of a rotary electric machine 
according to the present invention, angle of inclination of guide 
wall parts formed on a periphery of a cylindrical housing against 
the radial direction is set to be larger in the vicinity of the 
forward end of each support part in rotating direction and 
smaller in the vicinity of the backward end of the support part 
in the rotating direction. Preferably, the angle of inclination of the guide wall 
parts is set to become gradually smaller from the vicinity of the 
forward end of the support part in the rotating direction 
torwards the vicinity of the backward end of
