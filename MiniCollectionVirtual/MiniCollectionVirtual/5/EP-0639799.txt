<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for exposing a photosensitive substrate 18 has an exposure head 
24 mounted on a X-Y positioner. The head is provided with two laser beams 30 

and 32. The beam 30 presensitizes selected regions of the photosensitive 
substrate and impinges on the regions prior to or simultaneously with 

impingement thereon by beam 32, which constitutes a writing laser beam. The 
apparatus has the shape of a flatbed printing plate exposure device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus and a method
for offset printing plate presensitization.Offset printing plates are characterized by relatively
low sensitivity, as compared with other photosensitive
substrates, which requires a relatively high-powered light source
and a long exposure time for exposure thereof.Various techniques are known for presensitization of
offset printing plates in order to reduce the high energy
requirements for plate exposure. U.S. Patent 4,576,892 describes
a method of plate presensitization. European Patent Application
EP A 0453957 to Hoescht describes a method and apparatus for
printing plate presensitization.Generally speaking, known techniques for printing plate
presensitization affect the sensitivity of the entire printing
plate surface and thus increase the presence of spurious
information in areas of the plate wherein no information is
present. The present invention seeks to provide apparatus and a
technique for printing plate presensitization which overcomes
disadvantages of the prior art techniques.There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred
embodiment of the present invention a method for exposing a
photosensitive substrate including the steps of:
receiving image data for exposing the photosensitive
substrate;employing the image data to presensitize selected
regions of the photosensitive substrate in accordance with the
image data; andemploying the image data to expose the photosensitive
substrate at the selected regions.Preferably the step of employing the image data to
presensitize includes the step of selectively radiating the
selected regions in accordance with the image data.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
present invention, the step of selectively radiating includes
imagewise presensitization of the substrate in accordance with
the image data.Alternatively the step of employing the image data to
presensitize includes the step of selectively heating the
selected regions in accordance with the image data.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
present invention, the step of imagewise presensitization
includes pixelwise presensitization. The substrate is preferably a printing plate.Preferably, the step of employing the image data to
presensitize selected regions of the photosensitive substrate in
accordance with the image data operates at a different wavelength
from the step of employing the image data to expose the
photosensitive substrate at the selected regions.In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the
present
