<ABSTRACT>
The invention realises the object of greatly restricting the heat expansion of plastic pipe installations which do not have any solid supporting means on the pipe-guiding building ceiling (floor) or wall, with the result that warping is prevented. The essence of the invention consists in controlling the compressive or tensile forces, which are developed by a plastic pipe (100) when it tries to change its length as a result of temperature fluctuations, by means of a casing (110) which is fixed directly on the plastic pipe (100), runs in the manner of a supporting shell over the pipe section (103) to be stabilised, and has a considerably lower, linear expansion coefficient. Forcing the pipe section (103), to be stabilised, between two reactive points (150) at which the casing (110) is fixed on the pipe surface (102) prevents relative movement between the more expansion-intensive plastic pipe (100) and the less reactive casing (110). The subject matter of the invention is constituted by individual variants of the configuration of the casing (110), fixing it on the pipe surface (102), and covering with fittings located in the pipe section (103), and the like. Moreover, the invention proposes a milling tool as an auxiliary means for producing the novel stabilising arrangement.

Arrangement for limiting the linear thermal expansion due to
temperature variations in plastic pipe installations for free-flowing media

flows, with rigid fixing of the section of pipe (
103,203,303
) to be stabilized
of a plastic pipe (
100,200,300
) and with two supports, between them the
fixing occurs, for taking up the compressive and tensile forces induced by

the tendency towards thermal expansion and with positive guidance of the
section of pipe (
103,203,303
) to be stabilized in supporting shells for preventing
deflections at the plastic pipe (
100,200,300
) within the section of
pipe (
103,203,303
) to be stabilized, 
characterized in that
 over the section
of pipe (
103,203,303
) to be stabilized there runs a jacket (
110,210,310
),
which partially or completely surrounds the said section of pipe, is rigid in

the axial direction, is securely fixed on the surface of the pipe
(
102,202,302
) in the two supports (
150,150';250,250';350,350'
) constraining
the section of pipe (
103,203,303
) to be stabilized and has a significantly
lower coefficient of linear expansion (α
M
) in relation to the coefficient
of linear expansion (α
K
) of the plastic pipe (
100,200,300
), whereby the inherently
much greater change in length (ΔI
K
) of the plastic pipe (
100,200,
300
) is forcibly restricted to the lesser change in length (ΔI
M
) of the jacket
(
110,210,310
) (ΔI
K
=ΔI
M
), and the latter at the same time prevents deflections
within the section of pipe (
103,203,303
) to be stabilized.
Arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 a
support (
150
) which is separate from the continuing connector (
