<ABSTRACT>
A cover belt for a duct, which can be swung up from a closed position by a 
deflecting device movable in the longitudinal direction of the duct and falls back in 

its closed position behind the deflecting device. The cover belt is made of a flexibly 
deformable material (28) with metallic reinforcements (44, 46). It has a securing 

strip (32), a joint strip (34) and a cover strip (36). The securing strip (32) is secured 
along the duct (12), the joint strip (34) connects the securing strip (32) flexibly to 

the cover strip (36), and the cover strip (36) spans the duct and is supported on 
both sides of the latter. At least one belt-shaped textile reinforcement layer (48', 

48'') with essentially the same overall width as the cover belt (26) is embedded in 
the flexibly deformable material (28) in the area of the neutral plane of the cover 

belt (26). First oblong elements (44) of the metallic reinforcement are arranged 
between the underside (42) of the cover belt (26) and the textile reinforcements 

(48', 48'') so as to extend essentially at right angles to the longitudinal direction 
over the full width of the cover belt (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cover belt for a duct, made of a flexibly 
deformable material with metallic reinforcements. More particularly, it relates to a 
cover belt for a duct receiving electric cables or busbars for the power supply of a 
movable current consumer, for example a transporter bridge or quayside crane, 
which can be swung up from a closed position by a deflecting device on the 
movable current consumer and falls back in its closed position behind this 
deflecting device. The traditional method of feeding electrical power to quayside cranes 
through contact rails has now virtually been superseded by cable systems. 
However it is still necessary to provide protection for the cable from quay traffic. 
Furthermore, safety regulations in many ports require some form of housing. The 
simplest and most economic method is to provide an open duct, although this is 
hazard to pedestrians and can easily become clogged by debris, possibly 
damaging the cable. A more sophisticated solution is to cover the duct with hinged 
metal plates. This system however, suffers many drawbacks since maintenance 
requirements are considerable. Moreover, the complex design of the plate lifting 
mechanism slows transit speed of the crane. A semi-flexible cover belt is known from DE-A-3005454. A deflecting device 
on the current consumer produces local opening of the semi-flexible cover belt 
during movement of the current consumer, by twisting the belt by means of 
deflecting elements on the deflecting device. Behind the deflecting device the belt 
is again closed by resilient deformation and its dead weight. A device of this type 
thus permits unhindered winding and unwinding of an electric cable laid in the duct 
or, in the case of busbars, unhindered introduction of a current collector into the 
duct. At the same time the continuous cover belt ensures excellent protection of 
the cable and/or busbar in the duct, both against the effects of weather and 
against fouling. In addition unhindered movement of vehicles over the duct is 
always ensured. The belt disclosed in DE-A-3005454 consists of a flexibly deformable rubber 
material in which metallic reinforcements are embedded. It comprises a securing  
 
strip, a joint strip and a cover strip. The securing strip is secured along a first 
longitudinal edge of the duct. The joint strip flexibly connects the securing strip to 
the cover strip. The cover strip spans the duct and rests on both sides of the latter. It is clear that the design of the reinforcement of the
