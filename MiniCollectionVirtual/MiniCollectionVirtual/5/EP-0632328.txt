<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a diazo sensitized imaging 
element which is developable by plain water to a lithographic 
printing plate. Lithography is the process of printing from specially prepared 
surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting lithographic 
ink, whereas other areas, when moistened with water, will not accept 
the ink. The areas which accept ink form the printing image areas 
and the ink-rejecting areas form the background areas. In the art of photolithography, a photographic material is made 
imagewise receptive to oily or greasy inks in the photo-exposed 
(negative-working) or in the non-exposed areas (positive-working) on 
a hydrophilic background. In the production of common lithographic printing plates, also 
called surface litho plates or planographic printing plates, a 
support that has affinity to water or obtains such affinity by 
chemical treatment is coated with a thin layer of a photosensitive 
composition. Coatings for that purpose include light-sensitive 
polymer layers containing diazo compounds, dichromate-sensitized 
hydrophilic colloids and a large variety of synthetic photopolymers. Particularly diazo-sensitized systems are widely used. These 
systems have been extensively reviewed by Kosar J. in 
"Light-Sensitive Systems", Wiley, New York, 1965, Chapter 7. A 
generally used negative-working diazo-sensitized system is based on 
the capability of diazo compounds to harden a polymer when exposed 
to ultraviolet and blue radiation. Diazo compounds which have been 
used for the preparation of lithographic printing plates based on 
their hardening properties are e.g. diazonium salts whose photolysis 
products can harden polymers (natural colloids or synthetic resins) 
directly and diazonium polymers. Although polymers containing 
diazonium groups have a large structure they remain water soluble 
owing to the presence of the ionic diazonium groups. When these 
groups are destroyed by exposure to light an insoluble resin is 
formed. Particularly useful diazonium polymers are the condensation 
products of a carbonyl compound, e.g. an aldehyde, such as  
 
formaldehyde, with a diazonium salt of e.g. a p-aminodiphenylamine. 
These condensation products are usually designated diazo resins. In 
these systems a polymeric binder is optionally added to the diazo 
resin coating. Several types of supports can be used for the manufacturing of a 
diazo-sensitized lithographic printing plate. Common supports are 
metal supports like Al or Zn, polyester film supports and
