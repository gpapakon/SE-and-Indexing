<ABSTRACT>
A reinforced plastic pallet (10) is disclosed. The pallet (10) is characterized in that it is formed of an upper deck (12), a lower deck (14), and reinforcing elements (62). The reinforcing elements (62) are retained on the lower deck (14) in a manner that allows relative movement between the reinforcements (62) and the deck (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
 REINFORCED PLASTIC PALLETSField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to pallets for storing and transporting goods, and more particularly, to reinforced plastic pallets in which the reinforcements are not rigidly fixed to the pallet body.Background of the InventionIt is well known to use pallets for the transportation and storage of goods. Palletized goods are typically maintained in position above a floor for handling by forklift equipment, i.e., through the insertion of forklift tines into channels formed in the pallet or through engagement with the undersurface of the top deck of the pallet.Pallets have traditionally been formed of wood. Wood pallets, however, have many disadvantages. For example, they are subject to breakage and are therefore reusable only over a short period of time. Wooden pallets are also difficult to maintain in a sanitary condition, thereby limiting their usability in applications in which sanitation is important, such as in food- handling applications.In the past decades, with the growth of the plastics industry, a wide variety of plastics have been investigated to determine their suitability for use in producing pallets. Plastic pallets can easily be molded and are stronger and lighter in weight than wooden pallets. They can also be formed from materials capable of being recycled. Furthermore, plastic pallets are more durable than wooden pallets.Despite their advantages, plastic pallets have only been used to a limited degree. Although plastic pallets heretofore have been generally durable, have been reusable over an extended period of time and have been easy to maintain in a sanitary condition, they have suffered from the disadvantage that they are generally more expensive than wooden pallets. Although manufacturing costs are reflected in the cost of plastic pallets, a principal reason that plastic pallets cost considerably more than comparable wooden pallets is that they require a given amount of a relatively expensive plastic material for a desired measure of pallet strength. Another significant issue with plastic pallets is the tendency of payload to slip on the plastic pallet and of the pallet to move either relative to forklift tines or a transport surface, (i.e., the floor of a transport vehicle). Obviously, if payload slips on a plastic pallet, or if the pallet 

tends to slide relative to forklift tines or a transport surface, the commercial applicability of the pallet will be limited.In view of the above, a need exists for a plastic pallet having

CLAIMS
1. A reinforced plastic pallet comprising: a) an upper deck formed of a plastic material, the upper deck having an upper surface, a lower surface, a front edge, a back edge substantially parallel to the front edge, first and second side edges which are substantially parallel to one another and a plurality of legs extending substantially perpendicularly downward from the lower surface; b) a lower deck formed of a plastic material, the lower deck having an upper surface, a lower surface, a front edge, a back edge substantially parallel to the front edge, first and second side edges which are substantially parallel to one another and a plurality of sockets sized and positioned to mate with the legs extending from the upper deck; the lower deck further including a plurality of channels formed in its upper surface; and c) a plurality of reinforcing elements; wherein each channel is adapted to receive a reinforcing element in a manner which allows at least one reinforcing element to move relative to the upper and lower decks.
2. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1 , wherein each reinforcing element comprises a composite structural member of fiberglass reinforced plastic.
3. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 2, wherein the reinforcing elements S are fabricated from a pultrusion process.
4. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1 , wherein each reinforcing element has an I-shaped cross sectional configuration.
5. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1, wherein the channels are positioned substantially adjacent to the front, back and side edges of the lower deck.
6. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 5, which farther includes a central channel extending substantially perpendicularly between the channels at the front and back edges and through the center of the deck.
7. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 6, which further includes two sub-central channels, each extending substantially perpendicularly between the channels at the first and second sides and toward the center of the deck. 

8. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 5, which further includes a central channel- extending substantially perpendicularly between the channels at the first and second side edges and through the center of the deck.
9. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 8, which further includes two sub-central channels, each extending substantially perpendicularly between the channels at the front and back sides and toward the center of the deck.
10. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1, wherein the upper deck is secured to the lower deck by bolting, welding or adhering.
11. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1 , wherein the upper deck is provided with a plurality of anti-slip plugs which extend between the upper and lower surface of the upper deck.
12. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 11, wherein the anti-slip plugs are fabricated of rubber.
13. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1, wherein the upper deck includes nine legs, one leg extending downward from each comer, one leg extending downward from the middle of each edge, and one leg extending downward from the center.
14. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 13, wherein the lower deck includes nine leg receiving sockets, one socket positioned at each comer, one socket positioned at the middle of each edge, and one socket positioned at the center.
15. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1, wherein at least one channel includes a plurality of retainers to retain a reinforcing element in a manner which allows relative movement between the channel and the reinforcing element, the retainers being staggered along altemate sides of the channels.
16. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1, wherein each channel includes a plurality of retainers to retain a reinforcing element in a manner which allows relative movement between the channel and the reinforcing element, the retainers being staggered along altemate sides of the channels.
17. The reinforced plastic pallet of claim 1, wherein each socket includes a drainage port.
