<ABSTRACT>
A free-running inverter for a load, especially a low-voltage lamp, with a series circuit of two controllable switches (10, 11) which interconnects both inputs of the inverter connected to a rectified a.c. voltage, a control voltage having to exceed a given threshold to operate the switches (10, 11); and a trigger component (21) connected to one of the two control inputs of the switches (10, 11), the trigger component (21) having a voltage swing which is greater than the threshold voltage of the switches (10, 11), and the voltage excursion giving the voltage range between the breakdown voltage and the level to which the voltage returns after the breakdown.

Free running inverter for a load, in particular for a 
low-voltage lamp, 


having a series circuit of two controllable switches (10, 
11) which connect the two inputs of the inverter to be 

connected to a rectified a.c. voltage, 
having two control circuits, each for controlling a 
respective one of the two switches (10, 11), which are 

connected with the respective switches (10,11) to be 
controlled and which contain respective secondary windings 

(14, 16) of a transformer the primary winding (15) of which 
lies in a load circuit (C) to be connected to the inverter 

and including the load, whereby a control voltage, applied 
from a control circuit to the corresponding switch (10, 

11), for switching the corresponding switch (10, 11) must 
exceed a particular threshold voltage, and 
having a trigger element (21) which is connected with one 
of the two switches to be controlled (10, 11), whereby the 

breakdown voltage of the trigger element (21) is smaller 
than 32V and the trigger element (21) has a voltage range 

which is greater than the threshold voltage of the switch 
(10, 11) connected with the trigger element, whereby the 

voltage range gives the voltage region between the 
breakdown voltage and that voltage to which the voltage of 

the trigger element (21) returns after the breakdown, 
 
characterised in that,
 
the secondary winding of the control circuit connected with 

the trigger element (21) is divided into two series-connected 
windings (16a, 16b), arranged with the same 

winding sense, at the middle tap of which the trigger 
element (21) is connected. 
Inverter according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the trigger element is an SBS (silicon bilateral switch) or 

a PUT (programmable unit junction transistor) trigger  
 

element. 
Inverter according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the controllable switches (10, 11) are transistors. 
Inverter according to claim 3,
 
characterised in that,
 
the controllable switches (10, 11) are field effect 

transistors, and the voltage range of the trigger element 
(21) is larger than 5V. 
Inverter according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
the secondary winding (14) of one control circuit is 

arranged with the opposite winding sense to the secondary 
windings (16a, 16b) of the other control circuit. 
Inverter according to any preceding claim,
 
characterised in that,
 
there is arranged parallel to a capacitance (22) connected 

with the trigger element (21) a protective circuit (F) 
which switches off the t
rigger element as soon as the load 
current exceeds a predeterminable value. 
Inverter according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that,
 
the protection circuit (F) has supplied thereto a measuring 

signal proportional to the load current, in correspondence 
to which measuring signal the protection circuit short-circuits 

the capacitance (22) when a desired value is 
exceeded. 
Inverter according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
a series circuit of two capacitances (12, 13) is arranged 

parallel to the switches (10, 11), whereby a load connects  
 

the middle tap of the series circuit of the two switches 
(10, 11) with the middle tap of the series circuit of the 

two capacitances (12, 13). 
Inverter according to claim 8,
 
characterised in that,
 
the load includes a primary winding (15) of a transformer 

and a transformer (1) for supplying the low-voltage lamp.
