<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (16) includes a housing 
(18) having a plurality of terminal-receiving passages 

(50a-50c) extending between a forward mating end (34) of 
the housing and a rear end (36) thereof. A plurality of 

terminals (56-60) are received in the passages. A terminal 
position assurance device (26) is mounted on the housing 

for movement between first and second positions only when 
all of the terminals are properly positioned in their 

respective passages. A cover (38) is securable to the 
housing over at least a portion of the rear end thereof. 

The terminal position assurance device has a portion 
(46,80) which prevents securing the cover to the housing 

unless the terminal position assurance device is in its 
second position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to an electrical
connector which includes a hood or cover which cannot be
secured to the connector unless a terminal position
assurance device is properly positioned."Hooded" electrical connectors generally include
a connector housing having a plurality of terminal-receiving
passages extending between a forward mating end
of the housing and a rear end thereof. A plurality of
terminals are received in the passages, and the terminals
are connected to a multi-wire cable which extends away from
the rear end of the connector. A cover or hood covers or
encloses the rear end of the connector about the terminated
end of the multi-wire cable.On the other hand, terminal position assurance
devices are known for use in electrical connectors to
assure that all of the terminals are properly positioned
within the connector housing. Basically, a terminal
position assurance device is movable between a first
position and a second position. The device can move to the
second position only when all of the terminals are properly
positioned in their respective passages. If even a single
terminal is not properly positioned, the terminal position
assurance device cannot move away from its first position.
Such a device often is used to prevent mating of a
connector with a complementary connector unless the 
terminal position assurance device is moved to its second
or enabling position. A problem with such systems is that
an operator often does not discover that one or more
terminals are not properly positioned until attempts are
made to mate the connector. At that time, "defective"
connectors simply are wastefully discarded.EP 0 510 583 A2 discloses an electrical connector
comprising retaining means for retaining a number of
electric terminals housed inside respective cavities. The
retaining means are consisting of a pair of comb elements
having teeth cooperating with respective terminals, the comb
elements being integral with and connected to a terminal
block by an elastic hinge. The terminal block only can be
inserted into an associated casing if at first both comb
elements are turned inwards.EP 0 373 498 A2 is teaching a socket comprising a
contact base for receiving the contacts. To accomplish a
connection of the contacts with the contact base which can
not be lost, a plate associated to the contact base and
movable transverse to the insertion direction of the
contacts is provided. If the plate is in its first position,
movement of the

means (46, 80) on the terminal position assurance
device (26), to prevent securing the cover (38) to the

housing means (18) unless the terminal position
assurance device is in said second position;
characterized in that
said terminal position assurance device (26) includes a
first portion (44) operatively associated with the

terminals such that the device can move to its second
position only when the terminals are properly

positioned, and a second portion (46, 80) operatively
associated with the cover such that the cover can be

secured to the housing means only when the device is in
its second position; and
wherein said first portion of the terminal position
assurance device (26) comprises a plate (44) slidably

mounted on the housing means, the plate having a 
plurality of apertures (48a-48c) through which the

terminals extend.
Electrical connector as set forth in claim 1,
wherein said second portion of the terminal position

assurance device (26) comprises an arm (46, 80)
projecting from said plate (44) into a path (D) of

movement of the cover (38) into securing position on the
housing means (18) when the device is in its first

position.
Electrical connector (16) which includes
housings means (18) having a plurality of terminal-receiving

passages (50a - 50c) extending between a
forward mating end (34) of the housing means and a rear

end (36) thereof,


a plurality of terminals (56 - 60) received in the
passages,

device (26), to prevent securing the cover (38) to the

housing means (18) unless the terminal position
assurance device is in said second position;

characterized by that

said cover (38) is secured to the housing means (18)
by rib means (68, 74) on the cover positionable into

groove means (72) on the housing means, and said
terminal position assurance device (26) includes means

(80) for blocking the groove means when the device is in
its first position.
