<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst for purifying carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and 
nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases at the stoichiometric point or 

in oxygen-rich atmospheres, is disclosed, and it includes a 
support in which at least one element selected from the group 

consisting of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals and rare-earth 
elements including La is dissolved in titania to form a 

solid solution, and a noble metal catalyst ingredient loaded on 
the support. A process for purifying, by bringing the exhaust 

gases into contact with the catalyst, is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for purifying
exhaust gases and a process for purifying exhaust gases. More
particularly, it relates to a catalyst and a process which
can efficiently remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) from exhaust
gases whose oxygen concentrations are
higher than required for oxidizing carbon monoxide (CO)
and hydrocarbons (HC) therein.As catalysts for purifying automotive exhaust gases, there
have been employed 3-way catalysts so far which oxidize CO and
HC and reduce NOx to purify the exhaust gases. For example,
the 3-way catalysts have been known widely which comprise a
heat resistant support formed of cordierite, a catalyst carrier
layer formed of gamma-alumina and disposed on the support, and
a noble metal selected from the group consisting of Pt, Pd and
Rh and loaded on the catalyst carrier layer. The purifying performance of the 3-way catalysts for
purifying exhaust gases depends greatly on the air-fuel ratio
(A/F) of automotive engine. For instance, when the air-fuel
weight ratio is larger than 14.6, i.e., when the fuel
concentration is low (or on the fuel-lean side), the oxygen
concentration is high in exhaust gases. Accordingly, the
oxidation reactions removing CO and HC are active, but the
reduction reactions removing NOx are inactive. On the other
hand, when the air-fuel ratio is smaller than 14.6, i.e., when
the fuel concentration is higher (or on the fuel-rich side),
the oxygen concentration is low in exhaust gases. Accordingly,
the oxidation reactions are inactive, but the reduction
reactions are active.EP-A-0 488 250 discloses catalysts for purifying exhaust gases with
oxygen excess by NOx reduction. The catalysts may comprise
complex oxides of rare earth metals and group IVa metals, and a
noble metal. No complex oxide of Ti is specifically mentioned.Moreover, when driving automobiles, especially when
driving automobiles in urban areas, the automobiles are
accelerated and decelerated frequently. Consequently, the air-fuel
ratio varies frequently in the range of from the values
adjacent to the stoichiometric point (or the theoretical air-fuel
ratio: 14.6) to the fuel-rich side. In order to satisfy
the low fuel consumption requirement during the driving
conditions such as in the above-described urban areas, it is
necessary to operate the automobiles on the fuel-lean side
where the air-fuel mixture containing oxygen as excessive as
possible is supplied to the engines. Hence, it has been 
desired to develop a catalyst which is capable of adequately
purifying NOx even
