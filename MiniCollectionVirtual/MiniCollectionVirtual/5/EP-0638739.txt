<ABSTRACT>
In a synchronizing device for a gear change in a planetary gear train in a motor vehicle transmission, with the aid of which device, upon a gear change, one of two transmission parts (1, 2) provided with internal teeth (16, 17) is connected rotationally to a selector sleeve (3) having external teeth (18), the internal teeth (16, 17) have mutually facing sloping top surfaces (4, 5) and the transmission parts (1, 2) have conical internal contours (10, 11). For this purpose, there are arranged between the sloping top surfaces (4, 5) of the transmission parts (1, 2) two synchronizing rings (6, 7) which are provided with internal teeth (19, 20), the synchronizing rings (6, 7) having conical outer contours (8, 9) which rest against the conical internal contours (10, 11) of the transmission parts (1, 2). The synchronizing rings (6, 7) are provided with mutually facing and inter-engaging dogs (13, 15) or hollow-cylinder sections (14a to 14f) of circular segment shape by means of which the synchronizing rings (6, 7) are spaced apart and by means of which their rotatability relative to one another is limited. Arranged between the synchronizing rings (6, 7) there is in addition a resilient ring (12) which, on the one hand, touches parts of the external toothing (18) of the selector sleeve (3) and, on the other hand, rests on the dogs (13, 15) or the hollow-cylinder sections (14a to 14f) of the synchronizing rings (6, 7).

Synchroniser for a planetary gear train in a motor 
vehicle transmission, 


with the aid of which two transmission parts (1, 2) 
provided with internal toothing (16, 17) are selectably 

connected in a non-rotatable manner to an operating sleeve 
(3) comprising external toothing (18), and in which the 

internal toothing parts (16, 17) are formed with mutually 
facing roof-pitch inclines (4, 5) and the transmission 

parts (1, 2) comprise conical internal contours (10, 11), 
wherein 
between the roof-pitch inclines (4, 5) of the transmission 
parts (1, 2) are disposed two synchronising rings (6, 7) 

provided with internal toothing (19, 20), and in which the 
synchronising rings (6, 7) have conical outer contours (8, 

9) which lie against the conical internal contours (10, 11) 
of the transmission parts (1, 2), 
 
characterised in that 


the synchronising rings (6, 7) have either 
circle-segment-shaped catches (13, 15) or hollow 

cylindrical elements (14a to 14f) which face each other and 
grip each other, by which the synchronising rings (6, 7) 

are held spaced apart from each other and their 
rotatability with respect to each other is limited, 
and that between the synchronising rings (6, 7) a resilient 
ring (12, 12a) is disposed which on the one hand contacts 

parts of the external toothing (18) and on the other hand 
either sits on the catches (13, 15) of the synchronising 

rings (6, 7) or is pressed from the inside against the 
hollow cylindrical elements (14a to 14f). 
Synchroniser according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the position of the catches (13, 15) is determined in  

 
association with the position of the inner toothing (19, 

20) of the synchronising rings (6, 7) in such a way that a 
displacement of the synchronising rings (6, 7) by in each 

case one half the width of a toothing element can take 
place. 
Synchroniser according to claims 1 to 2, characterised 
in that the resilient ring (12, 12a) contacts the external 

toothing (18) of the operating sleeve (3) when switching 
through on at least three circle portions (A, B, C). 
Synchroniser according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the hollow cylindrical elements (14a to 14f) extend 

over a circle portion which allows a rotatability with 
respect to each other of up to and including 6Â°. 
Synchroniser according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the hollow cylindrical elements (14a to 14f) are 

formed on at least one respective surrounding part as a 
stop (21, 22, 29 to 32), and that the position of the stops 

(21, 22, 29 to 32) is determined in association with the 
position of the toothing of the synchronising rings (6, 7) 

in such a way that a displacement of the synchronising 
rings (6, 7) by in each case one half the width of a 

toothing element can take place. 
Synchroniser according to claims 4 to 5, characterised 
in that the resilient ring (12a) is disposed inside the 

hollow cylindrical elements (14a to 14f) and outside the 
operating sleeve toothing (18). 
Synchroniser according to claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the operating sleeve (3) is disposed in an axially 

displaceable and rotationally fixed manner on a 
differential gear housing (25).  

 
Synchroniser according to claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the transmission part (1) is connected to the ring 

wheel of a first planetary set (24) and the transmission 
part (2) is connected to the planetary carrier of a second 

planetary set (23). 
Synchroniser according to claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the hollow cylindrical elements (14a to 14f) are 

formed with hook-shaped stops (37, 38). 
Synchroniser according to claims 1 to 6 and 10, 
characterised in that the resilient ring (12a) comprises a 

roof-shaped or channel-shaped outer contour (34, 35), 
whereas the hollow cylindrical elements (14a to 14f) have 

roof-shaped or channel-shaped internal contours (33, 36).
