<ABSTRACT>
An ultra-sound testing device for gas pressure accumulators is used to test a predeterminable set position that can be taken by a movable separating element (20) inside an accumulator (10) that can be filled with gas and connected to a fluid circuit. The separating element (20) has at least one testing body associated with a visible mark (34) which indicates the set position of the separating element (20), and on the basis of which an ultra-sound testing device provided for the respective testing body can be set on the accumulator (10). This testing device allows a plurality of accumulators of the same type to be tested for their predeterminable gas pressure set value, which corresponds to the gas pre-filling pressure, by means of a single hand apparatus. This kind of test is economical and achieves reliable results.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus with a hydraulic accumulator and an ultrasonic testing device 
which can be placed on it for checking a desired position which can be 

pre-set, which can be taken from a movable isolating element (20), inside 

the accumulator (10), which can be filled with gas and connected to a fluid 
circuit, by means of the ultrasonic testing facility which can be placed onto 

the accumulator, the isolating element (20) having several test bodies with 
a distance between them that can be pre-set, to which visible markings 

(34) on the outer periphery of the accumulator, characterizing the desired 
position of the isolating element (20) are assigned, and a manual device 

(36) which can be brought into a position aligned with the markings (34) 
as a part of the ultrasonic test facility, said manual device having a testing 

head (42) available for each test body. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the test body in each 
case is formed from a guide band (28, 30) and/or a packing ring (26) of 

the isolating element (20). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the manual 
device (36) has an interface (44) by which it can be connected to a 

measurement facility of the ultrasonic test device.
