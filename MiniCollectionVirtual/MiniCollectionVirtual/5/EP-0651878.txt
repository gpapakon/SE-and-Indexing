<ABSTRACT>
A pressure sensor (1) for pressure measurement in a combustion chamber or the like includes a photoelastic medium (6) such as quartz means for directing polarised light through said photoelastic medium (6) and detector means (12) for detecting the change in polarisation of the light after it is passed through said photoelastic medium (6). In use the pressure sensor is disposed so that the photoelastic medium (6) is subject to pressure in the combustion chamber, changes in pressure acting on the medium causes changes in the light transmission properties and hence affect the light detected by the detecting means (12), thus producing a signal indicative of the pressure in said combustion chamber to which the medium is subjected.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PRESSURE SENSOR This invention relates to a pressure sensor. In particular it relates to a pressure sensor for use for measurement of pressure in combustion chambers of engines. Electronic engine management is increasingly used in engines of modern vehicles to maximise power output and minimise fuel consumption and the output of emissions. Typically, the engine management system takes information including engine speed, position, temperature, inlet air pressure/temperature or inlet air mass from sensors connected to the engine. This information is used to calculate a "best guess" at the operating conditions within the combustion chambers (cylinders) of the engine which is a guess which is averaged over many cycles of the engine and over the different cylinders of the engine. Engine load is typically determined from measurements of the mass of air drawn into the inlet manifold of the engine. The ignition spark timing and fuel delivery are determined from algorithms that process external data such as engine speed, engine position and engine load. These methods result in some error in controlling the engine spark and fuel delivery. The error is worst during transients in the engine load.The present invention seeks to provide better real time information relating to the operating conditions within the combustion chamber and information which can be specific to particular cylinders of the engine since in an engine all the cylinders do not behave identically.Thus, the present invention broadly relates to a pressure sensor for insertion into a combustion chamber which is capable of measuring high gas pressures at high temperatures to produce a signal which is directly related to the pressure in a combustion chamber of that engine.The provision of such a signal measuring the rise of pressure within the cylinder from the start of an intake 

stroke through the entire power stroke of the engine provides a powerful tool for the designer of engine management systems to allow the engine management system to know the operating conditions within each cylinder of the engine in real time: such a sensor providing in-cylinder information from each cylinder of the engine can replace less accurate mass intake air flow measurement techniques. This allows more accurate calculation of critical engine management parameters such as fuel/air ratio and ignition spark timing. Improvements would be most evident during sudden engine transients when the advantage of real time data allows the engine management system to track the

THE CLAIMS:-
1. A pressure sensor for pressure measurement in a combustion chamber or the like including: a photoelastic medium; means for directing polarised light through said photoelastic medium; and detector means for detecting the change in polarisation of the light after it is passed through said photoelastic medium, the arrangement being such that in use the pressure sensor can be disposed so that the photoelastic medium is subject to pressure in the combustion chamber, changes in pressure acting on the medium causing changes in the light transmission properties of the medium and hence affecting the light detected by the detecting means, thus producing a signal indicative of the pressure in said combustion chamber to which the medium is subjected.
2. A pressure sensor according to claim 1 wherein the photoelastic medium is quartz. 3. A pressure sensor according to claim 2 wherein the quartz is in the form of a rod having a longitudinal axis, the rod being disposed inside a generally tubular metal housing, the rod being fixed in a first end of the housing at which end means for producing light and the detector means are located, the second end of housing being open to allow pressure to act on said quartz rod to compress the rod along its longitudinal axis.
4. A pressure sensor according to claim 3 wherein means for producing polarised light and means for detecting polarised light are incorporated in the housing in which the photoelastic material is located.
5. A pressure sensor according to any of claims 1 to 4 wherein the means for producing polarised light comprises a light emitting diode and a sheet of polarising material. 6. A pressure sensor according to any of claims 1 to 5 


wherein the detector means comprises a sheet of polarising material and a photovoltaic cell is provided to convert light passing through the detector means into an electrical signal. 7. A pressure sensor according to any of claims 1 to 6 including means for prestressing the photoelastic medium.
8. A pressure sensor according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the means for producing polarised light and means for detecting and analysing polarised light are located remotely from the pressure sensor and are connected to said pressure sensor by optical fibres.

in the combustion chamber.
13. A spark plug according to claim 12 wherein a ceramic rod is bonded to the free end of the quartz rod which acts as a push rod transmitting pressure from the combustion chamber to the quartz rod.
