<ABSTRACT>
Described is a brake anti-locking control method in which the brake pressure at the wheels is varied when they show a tendency to lock. A steering angle  delta 1 is computed from the lateral acceleration and speed of the vehicle and a series of constants, and the difference calculated between the steering angle actually measured  delta 2 and the calculated angle  delta 1. This difference ( delta 2 -  delta 1) is used to displace the working point on the  mu vs. slip curve in the direction which will give an increase in lateral stability.

<CLAIMS>
Antilock brake control method in which, when 
there is a tendency for the wheels to lock, the brake 

pressure is varied for the purpose of preventing an 
excessive wheel slip, in which the brake pressure is 

varied during braking and travel round a curve and in 
which the actual steering angle δ₂ is measured and 

evaluated, characterized in that a steering angle value 
δ₁ is determined from the parameters of vehicle speed, 

transverse acceleration and constants specific to the 
vehicle and in that the magnitude of the difference 

(δ₂ - δ₁) between the actual steering angle δ₂ and the 
steering angle value δ₁ is used for displacing the 

working point towards smaller slip values on the rising 
branch of the µ-slip curve. 
Antilock brake control method according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the rate of increase of 

the steering angle signal additionally acts on the 
displacement.
