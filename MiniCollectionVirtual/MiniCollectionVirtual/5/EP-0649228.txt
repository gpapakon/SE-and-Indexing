<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a modulator (20) which controls a transmitter (10) to transmit a light beam. The modulator (20) comprises a microwave delay line (25) which is loaded in segments by varactor diodes (27). A high-pass filter (28) is connected downstream and a pre-emphasiser (30) is connected upstream of this line. The pre-emphasiser operates using analog technology and compensates precisely for the distortion caused by the delay line (25). This creates a linear relationship between the amplitude of the useful signal (NS) which is introduced via the one input (21) and the phase of the auxiliary carrier signal (TF) which is introduced via the other input (22). The phase-modulated signal can be tapped at the output (23) and serves to control the transmitter (10).
