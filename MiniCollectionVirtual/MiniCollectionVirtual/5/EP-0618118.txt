<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to a
hydraulically operated brake system of a motor vehicle, and
more particularly to an improvement in accuracy of control
of the brake pressures for the vehicle wheels by an
anti-lock brake pressure control means of such brake system.Such anti-lock brake pressure control means of a
hydraulic brake system of a motor vehicle is adapted to
maintain the slip amount or slip ratio of each wheel of the
vehicle within an optimum range during braking of the
vehicle, for thereby shortening a required braking distance
of the vehicle while maintaining high running stability of
the vehicle under braking. To this end, the anti-lock type
hydraulic brake system generally includes wheel speed
detecting means for detecting the rotating speeds of the
front right and left wheels and the rear right and left
wheels of the vehicle, hydraulic brakes operated by
hydraulic brake pressures applied thereto to lower the
speeds of the respective wheels, and an anti-lock pressure
regulating device for regulating the brake pressures on the 
basis of the wheel speeds detected by the wheel speed
detecting means, so as to prevent excessive slipping of the
wheels.Usually, the brake pressure for each wheel is
regulated to maintain a difference between the detected
wheel speed and an actual running speed of the vehicle
within an optimum range for thereby maintaining the slip
amount or ratio of the wheel within the optimum range.
According to this arrangement, it is necessary to detect the
vehicle speed as well as the wheel speeds.As means for detecting the vehicle speed, it is
known to use a Doppler-effect type sensor for detecting the
ground speed of the vehicle, namely, the speed of the
vehicle with respect to the ground or road surface on which
the vehicle is running. Since such Doppler-effect type speed
sensor is generally expensive, however, the vehicle speed is
commonly estimated from the wheel speeds, as disclosed in
JP-A-60-50060. Described more specifically, a highest one of
the detected speeds of the four wheels is used as the
vehicle speed, that is, as an estimated vehicle speed, in
view of the fact that the highest wheel speed is closest to
the actual vehicle speed. The thus obtained estimated
vehicle speed may be smoothed as needed before it is used as
the vehicle speed.But, the estimated vehicle speed may be
considerably lower than the actual vehicle speed if the
amount of slip of the highest-speed wheel is excessively 
large during braking of the vehicle. In other words, even
the
