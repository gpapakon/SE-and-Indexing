<ABSTRACT>
An electrical cable connector (11, 12) for bicycles
that has a simple structure, low cost, and excellent

shielding against shocks, moisture, and the like is
disclosed. The connector (11, 12) includes a connector

body (60) which has a top surface and a bottom surface,
and has a slit (61) which forms a passageway between

the top and bottom surfaces. The top surface includes
an inclined portion (62) which extends from the slit

(61) to a flat terminal section (63). A flat cable
(10, 13) extends along the bottom surface, through the

slit (61), and along the top surface such that a
terminal (65) at the end of the flat cable (10, 13) is

positioned on the flat terminal section (63). In a
disclosed application, the connector (11, 12) plugs

into a female connector (53, 56) of a switch unit (20)
of a bicycle lever bracket (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flat bicycle
cable connector for forming connections with the
signal wires from sensors or switches, and, more
particularly, to a flat bicycle cable connector for
forming connections with the bicycle switches
disposed on a lever bracket designed to hold a brake
lever and fixed to the bicycle handlebar.Bicycles are often equipped with displays for
displaying the bicycle speed, the distance traveled,
the shifter position, and various other types of
information. Displays capable of displaying such a
large volume of information are equipped with
switches for switching among the types of parameters
displayed or for indicating the start of
measurement. In addition, displays are often 
detachably mounted on bicycles, and display switches
are often integrated with the displays. There are
also switches that are disposed on lever brackets
(brackets that are designed to hold brake levers and
that are fixed to the bicycle handlebar) to achieve
better operability (US Patent 4,071,892).
Connectors for connecting the signal wires from
sensors (such as those for sensing the shifting
position of the shift lever section) with the
circuit substrates provided with these switches are
used to allow the shifting position to be viewed on
a display.Existing connectors for connecting the signal
wires from various sensors with circuit substrates
tend to develop faulty contacts and other defects as
a result of vibration. Another drawback is the
failure to properly seal such connectors against
water or the like, making it easier for the
connection terminals to become corroded or otherwise
affected. Still another drawback is that
conventional connectors have complex structures,
high cost, and low impact resistance against
vibration or the like.A flat cable connector is known from US Patent
Number. 4,770,645 (ANTES). This connector provides
a method and apparatus for connecting a flat cable
to a printed circuit board. The connector comprises
a retaining member comprising a bar portion around
which a cable is wrapped, and means for lining and 
securing the retaining member to the printed circuit
board.The first aspect of the present invention is
directed towards a flat bicycle cable connector in
accordance with Claim 1.The second aspect of the present invention is
directed towards a method for providing a male
connector for a flat cable in accordance with Claim
9.In general terms, the present invention
concerns a bicycle connector for a flat cable that
has a simple structure, low cost, and excellent

<CLAIMS>
A flat bicycle cable connector (11,12),
comprising:


a connector body (60) having a bottom surface, a
top surface that includes a terminal surface (63),

and a tip surface, the connector body (60) having a
slit (61) formed therein for allowing a flat cable

(10) to pass between the top and bottom surfaces
without extending along the tip surface; and
a flat cable (10) that comprises a plurality of
signal wires arranged in parallel, the cable having a

terminal (65) on at least one side, the cable
extending along the bottom surface, through the slit

(61), and along the top surface such that the
terminal (65) is positioned on the terminal surface

(63), whereby

said flat bicycle cable connector (11,12) is a male
cable connector (11,12), and in that the flat cable

(10) extends to the flat terminal surface (63) such
that the signal wires of the flat cable (10) are

positioned to make electrical connection with
conductors of a female connector (56,53).
A flat bicycle cable connector (11,12) as
defined in Claim 1, wherein the connector body (60)

has a tip portion which includes said tip surface,
and the slit (61) is spaced from the tip portion such

that the flat cable (10) passes from the bottom
surface to the top surface without extending along

the tip surface. 
The flat bicycle cable connector (11,12) as
defined in any preceding Claim, wherein the terminal

surface (63) is generally parallel to the bottom
surface, and the top surface includes an inclined

section (62) which extends generally from the slit
(61) to the terminal surface (63).
The flat bicycle cable connector (11,12) as
defined in any preceding Claim, wherein the connector

body (60) is formed from an elastic material.
The flat bicycle cable connector (11,12) as
defined in Claim 4, wherein the elastic material is

rubber.
The flat bicycle cable connector (11,12) as
defined in any preceding Claim, wherein the slit (61)
