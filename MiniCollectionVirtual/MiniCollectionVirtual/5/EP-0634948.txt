<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns treatment of liquids such 
as, for example, oils, in order to remove 
polychlorobiphenyls (PCB's). PCB's, have been found to be undesirable 
contaminants of liquids as they are non-biodegradable. 
The most effective treatment of PCB contaminated 
liquids, such as electrical oils, is incineration. 
However, in order to conserve such oils, their re-use is 
allowable when PCB contamination is below 10 ppm. Thus, 
methods have been devised for removing PCB's from oils. 
One method is to use sodium metal, which is both 
dangerous and expensive. Because sodium is highly 
reactive special plant is required for this method. 
Another method is catalysed treatment with hydrogen at 
high pressure. Again special plant is required to cope 
with the high pressures and hence this method is also 
expensive. An object of this invention is to provide a 
method of removing PCB's from liquids without the need 
for hydrogen under pressure. According to this invention there is provided a 
process for removal of polychlorobiphenyls from a liquid  
 
comprising passing the liquid through a catalytic bed at 
an elevated temperature wherein the catalytic bed 
comprises a carrier and one or more active metal 
compounds selected from the compounds of nickel, copper, 
molybdenum, tungsten and chromium. Typically the process of the invention will be 
used for removing PCB's from oils and synthetic liquids. 
Examples of oils include electrical oils, heat transfer 
oils, hydraulic oils, fuel oils and process oils. 
Examples of synthetic liquids include esters and various 
polymers used as electrical, hydraulic and heat transfer 
liquids. Preferred metal compounds include oxides, 
hydroxides and sulphides. Preferably a nickel compound 
will always be present either alone or in combination 
with one or more other metal compounds. Suitable carriers for the active metal compounds 
are those having a relatively high surface area. 
Carriers that may be re-used as fuels are one type that 
may be suitable for use in the invention, such as carbon 
based carriers, for example charcoal and coke. Other 
suitable carriers may be of a type that can be 
regenerated by burning off collected residues. Examples 
of that type of carrier include clays, alumina, silica 
and bauxite. Thus, exhausted catalytic mass may be regenerated  
 
in the case of non-carbon based carriers by controlled 
burning off of deactivating residues. Carbon based 
catalytic mass may be disposed of as solid fuel. In 
both cases process liquid is
