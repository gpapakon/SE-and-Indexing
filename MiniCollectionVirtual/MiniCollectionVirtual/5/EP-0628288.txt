<ABSTRACT>
A medical probe device of this invention comprising a catheter 
having a control end and a probe end. The probe end includes a 

stylet guide housing having at least one stylet port and stylet 
guide means for directing a flexible stylet outward through at least 

one stylet port and through intervening tissue to targeted tissues. 
A stylet is positioned in at least one of said stylet guide means, 

the stylet comprising a non-conductive sleeve having a RF electrode 
lumen and an optional a fluid supply lumen and a temperature sensor 

lumen therein. At least one portion of an opposed surface of the 
electrode lumen and the electrode can be spaced apart to define a 

liquid supply passageway for delivery of medicament liquid. The RF 
electrode enclosed within the non-conductive sleeve has a distal 

length optionally having at least one current focusing groove means 
thereon and a distal tip shaped to focus current crowding on its 

terminal end, whereby Rf current passing therefrom into surrounding 
tissue forms a lesion extending outward from the groove and tip. 

The focusing groove means can be a plurality of annular focusing 
grooves or a spiral focusing groove thereon.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to a device for 
penetrating body tissues for medical purposes such as tissue ablation 
and fluid substance delivery, for example. The device 
penetrates tissue to the precise target selected in order to deliver 
energy to the tissue and/or deliver substances. It limits this 
treatment to the precise preselected site, thereby minimizing trauma 
to normal surrounding tissue and achieving a greater medical benefit. 
This device is a catheter-like device for positioning a treatment 
assembly in the area or organ selected for medical treatment 
with one or more stylets in the catheter, mounted for extension from 
a stylet port in the side of the catheter through surrounding tissue 
to the tissue targeted for medical intervention. Treatment of cellular tissues usually requires direct contact 
of target tissue with a medical instrument, usually by surgical 
procedures exposing both the target and intervening tissue to 
substantial trauma. Often, precise placement of a treatment probe 
is difficult because of the location of targeted tissues in the body 
or the proximity of the target tissue to easily damaged, critical 
body organs, nerves, or other components.  
 Benign prostatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia (BPH), for example, 
is one of the most common medical problems experienced by men 
over 50 years old. Urinary tract obstruction due to prostatic 
hyperplasia has been recognized since the earliest days of medicine. 
Hyperplastic enlargement of the prostate gland often leads to 
compression of the urethra, resulting in obstruction of the urinary 
tract and the subsequent development of symptoms including frequent 
urination, decrease in urinary flow, nocturia, pain, discomfort, and 
dribbling. The association of BPH with aging has been shown to 
exceed 50% in men over 50 years of age and increases in incidence to 
over 75% in men over 80 years of age. Symptoms of urinary obstruction 
occur most frequently between the ages of 65 and 70 when 
approximately 65% of men in this age group have prostatic enlargement. Currently there is no proven effective nonsurgical method of 
treatment of BPH. In addition, the surgical procedures available 
were not totally satisfactory. Patients suffering from the 
obstructive symptoms of this disease were provided with few options: 
continue to cope with the symptoms (i.e., conservative management), 
submit to drug therapy at early stages, or submit to surgical 
intervention. More than 430,000 patients per year undergo surgery 
for removal of

<CLAIMS>
A medical probe device for medical treatment 
of tissue at a treatment site in a body accessible 

through a natural body lumen defined by a wall and 
opening outside the body to provide a natural body 

opening comprising a catheter (2) having proximal and 
distal extremities and having a passageway (28) 

extending from the proximal extremity to the distal 
extremity, a flexible stylet (8) slidably mounted in the 

passageway, the distal extremity of the catheter having 
a stylet guide housing (6) having at least one stylet 

port and stylet guide means in communication with the 
passageway for directing the stylet sidewise of the 

catheter, the stylet including an insulating sleeve (30) 
having proximal and distal extremities and having an 

electrode lumen (50) terminating in a distal port at the 
distal extremity of the insulating sleeve, a radio 

frequency electrode (32) being positioned in the 
electrode lumen for longitudinal movement therein, a 

handle (4) coupled to the proximal extremity of the 
catheter for introducing the distal extremity of the 

catheter into the natural body opening to a position 
adjacent the treatment site, the handle including means 

(334,338,10,11,12,13) for advancing the stylet to cause 
the tip of the radio frequency electrode to penetrate 

the wall and extend into the tissue at the treatment 
site with the 
insulating sleeve extending through the 
wall, means (16) for supplying radio frequency energy to 

the radio frequency electrode to cause a thermal effect 
in the tissue at the treatment site while the insulating 

sleeve protects the wall from the thermal effect caused 
by the radio frequency energy, the insulating sleeve 

being provided with a second lumen (60) extending from 
the proximal extremity to the distal extremity of the 

insulating sleeve. 
A medical probe device as in Claim 1 
wherein a third lumen (58) is provided in the insulating sleeve that terminates in a sealed 

closure adjacent the distal end of the insulating sleeve and in which lumen a temperature 
sensing means (64) is provided which is positioned at the distal extremity of the insulating 

sleeve.  
 
A medical probe device as in Claim 2 wherein 
an additional temperature sensing means (66) is disposed 

in the second lumen (60) of the insulating sleeve (30), 
the additional temperature sensing means (66) being 

spaced proximally from said first temperature 
sensing means (64) whereby, when the insulating sleeve is 

disposed in the wall, said first temperature sensing 
means monitors the temperature of the tissue surrounding 

the radio frequency electrode (32) and the additional 
temperature sensing means monitors the temperature of 

the wall.

surface of the electrode lumen is spaced from the outer 

surface of the radio frequency electrode (32) to define
