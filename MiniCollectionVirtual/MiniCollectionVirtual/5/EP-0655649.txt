<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of addenda 
in silver halide photographic elements to improve heat 
stability. Photofinishers that use photosensitive paper 
to produce color prints desire short processing times 
in order to increase output. One way of obtaining 
rapid processing is to accelerate the development time 
by increasing the chloride content of the emulsions 
used in the photographic paper. However, as the 
chloride content of a photographic emulsion is 
increased, it becomes more difficult to obtain good 
invariant photosensitivity. One of the problems with silver chloride 
emulsions is their severe propensity to storage 
deterioration. Photographic emulsions that have a high 
silver chloride content are prone to fog increase due 
to high temperature and humidity during storage. These 
changes may vary from layer to layer resulting in color 
imbalance and a loss of quality of the print material. 
Attempts have been made to reduce fog formation during 
storage by addition of inhibitory agents to the silver 
halide emulsions. For example, U.S. Patents T866,036; 
2,440,110; 3,043,696; 3,057,725; 3,226,232; 3,397,986; 
3,447,925; and 3,761,277 describe the addition of 
organic disulfides to silver halide emulsions to lessen 
the tendency towards fog growth. High chloride content color print paper also 
has an undesirable sensitivity to temperature changes 
during exposure. For example, when the temperature 
upon exposure rises due to heat from the exposing  
 
element during printing, the print density changes if 
the printing conditions are left at the initial set 
values. This may result in prints varying in density 
that were exposed at the normal temperature. This 
density difference contributes to print variability and 
is not acceptable to photofinishers. Very often, an 
increase in temperature during exposure of the paper 
may result in a selective increase in speed in one 
layer, for instance the cyan layer, over another light 
sensitive layer such as the magenta layer. This 
results in improper color balance of the color print, 
and requires the photofinisher to readjust his printing 
conditions in order to compensate for this density 
fluctuation. This results in a loss in operating 
efficiency. This deficiency in the use of high silver 
chloride color paper material is recognized in the art. 
In particular, EP 0 367,227 (1988) discusses reducing 
heat sensitivity by employing certain spectral 
sensitizing dyes in combination with mercapto azoles. 
However, these dye structures have
