<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain substituted 3-(3-pyridinyl)-1H-indoles 
which selectively inhibit the 
thromboxane A₂ synthetase enzyme without significantly 
inhibiting the action of the prostacyclin synthetase or 
cyclo-oxygenase enzymes. The compounds are thus useful 
as therapeutic agents, preferably in combination with a 
thromboxane A₂/endoperoxide receptor antagonist, for 
example in the treatment of atherosclerosis and unstable 
angina and for prevention of reocclusion, both acute and 
chronic, after percutaneous transluminal coronary and 
femoral angioplasty. They may also find clinical utility 
in a further variety of disease conditions in which 
thromboxane A₂ has been implicated such as in the 
treatment of myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac 
arrhythmias, transient ischaemic attack, tumour 
metastasis, peripheral vascular disease, bronchial 
asthma, renal disease, cyclosporin-induced 
nephrotoxicity, renal allograft rejection, trauma, 
vascular complications of diabetes and endotoxin shock, 
and in coronary artery bypass surgery and haemodialysis. Clinical evaluation of thromboxane synthetase 
inhibitors has, in general, been disappointing, and 
several reasons have been put forward to explain the poor 
performance. It is now realised that prostaglandin H₂, 
the precursor to thromboxane A₂, can also activate the 
thromboxane receptor thus negating the potential 
beneficial effect of enzyme inhibition. This problem can 
be overcome by combining the thromboxane synthetase 
inhibitor with an antagonist of the thromboxane 
A₂/prostaglandin H₂ receptor. In addition, there is 
evidence to suggest that complete inhibition of 
thromboxane synthetase is important, and doses of 
inhibitors used may have been insufficient to achieve 
this. Compounds with greater potency would therefore be 
desirable.  The potency of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors is 
usually expressed as the concentration of compound 
required to inhibit platelet microsomal thromboxane 
synthetase by 50% (IC₅₀). When thromboxane synthetase 
inhibitors are used clinically, the potency in human 
whole blood is clearly of more importance than that in an 
isolated enzyme assay. Furthermore, the concentration 
required to inhibit the enzyme by at least 80% in whole 
blood is probably a more relevant predictor of the 
ability of the compound to produce complete inhibition of 
thromboxane synthesis in humans. Surprisingly, it has been found that compounds of 
the present invention have a lower IC₈₀ in human whole 
blood than
