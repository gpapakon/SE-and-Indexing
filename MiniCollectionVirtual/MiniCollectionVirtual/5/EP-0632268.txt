<ABSTRACT>
An instrument (10) for evaluating the quality of air within an enclosed space 
includes a sensor array (24) and a data processing system (30), the sensor 

array being positioned to monitor the air within the space, with at least two 
nonspecific sensors for detecting odifero
us and nonodiferous pollutants present 
in the air, a humidity sensor and sensors for detecting temperature and carbon 

dioxide, the data processing system including a computer which collects the 
sensor signal data and processes it to extract features from the same, and 

being controlled by pattern recognition software to analyze the data to 
determine the pollution index of the air. The pattern recognition software of 

choice is an artificial neural network (50) but alternative means include direction 
cosine or Euclidean distance analysis systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of environmental 
control of enclosed spaces, and more specifically to the field of instruments 
designed to monitor and control interior environments. Control of interior environments has gone beyond merely addressing the 
temperature and humidity of the air to attempting to identify and eliminate 
airborne contaminants as well. Under the rubric of "indoor air quality", such 
programs have tried to identify the causes of so-called "sick building syndrome" 
and to take appropriate corrective measures. A basic problem, however, is the sheer numbers of potential 
contaminants. As discussed below, sensors are readily available for identifying 
a number of such compounds, but significant problems have prevented the 
development and implementation of a workable sensor/control system. Such 
a system is the goal of the present invention. It is known in the art to combine sensors with computers in an effort to 
identify odors. Examples of such systems can be found in journal articles such 
as the following: Nakamoto, Fukuda & Moriizumi, "Improvement of 
identification capability in an odor-sensing system," 3 Sensors and Actuators 
B 221 (1991); Gardner, "Detection of vapours and odours from a multisensor 
array using pattern recognition", 4 Sensors and Actuators 109 (1991); and  
 
Shurmer, "The fifth sense: On the scent of the electronic nose," IEE Review 
95 (March 1990). Patents that address this problem include U.S. Patents No. 
5,088,314 (Takashi, Feb. 18, 1992); 4,884,435 (Ehara, Dec. 5, 1989); 
4,770,027 (Ehara, Sep. 13, 1988); and 4,399,687 (Collins, Aug. 23, 1983). 
Again, none of these references discloses an apparatus that provides indoor 
air quality information required for environmental control. The broad object of the present invention is to provide an indoor air 
quality sensor that simulates the olfactory response of a human occupant of an 
enclosed space. That and other objects are achieved in the present invention, an 
instrument for evaluating the quality of air within an enclosed space. A plurality 
of sensors is positioned to monitor the air within the space, and this sensor 
array includes at least two nonspecific sensors for detecting odiferous and 
nonodiferous pollutants present in the air as well as a humidity sensor. It is 
preferred that the sensor array also include sensors for temperature and carbon 
dioxide. Each sensor provides an electrical signal proportional to the activation 
thereof. A computer collects the sensor signal
