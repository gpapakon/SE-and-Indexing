<ABSTRACT>
An optical device having a variable index of refraction across 
its surface (3) includes a light transmissive material with a 

plurality of regions in the light transmissive material. Each 
region has an index of refraction which is different from the 

remainder of the material. The regions may be arranged in the 
surface of the material such that the density of the regions 

on the surface varies across the surface. Each region may be 
a bore (2), including a hole that extends through the light 

transmissive material. Variations in the density of the 
regions or bores as well as the depth and shape of the bores 

may be utilized to create variations of the refractive index 
within the light transmissive material.

<DESCRIPTION>
Light transmitting optical elements such as lenses and prisms 
are generally made by shaping a material of uniform index of 
refraction. Typically, such optical elements are processed by 
grinding and polishing, as well as molding. Optical fiber 
elements are typically fabricated by grading to change the 
index of refraction of the fiber material while maintaining 
uniform fiber shape. Recently, techniques for manufacturing optical elements such 
as lenses have been developed where holes are created into a 
body of a photo-transmissive material. The holes may be 
filled with another material having a refractive index higher 
than the refractive index of the substrate used as the 
phototransmissive material. This technique alters the index 
of refraction of the optical element. Additionally, the index 
of refraction of phototransmissive planar materials may be 
altered by contouring the surface of the planar material. 
However, these current techniques for creating light 
transmissive optical elements in a planar material do not 
adequately vary the index of refraction at different locations 
therein. It is therefore desirable to create a planar light 
transmitting optical element having varying indexes of 
refraction throughout the surface thereof and at different 
locations thereon. Such light transmitting devices are 
desired to be used in visible light optical applications as 
well as infrared light applications.  It is also desirable to create a light transmitting element 
that can be more readily integrated with sensors fabricated in 
a semiconductor wafer. The aforementioned goals may be achieved by constructing an 
optical device in accordance with the principles of the 
present invention. The optical device includes a surface of a 
light transmissive material; a plurality of regions in the 
surface where each region has an index of refraction different 
from the remainder of the material. The regions are arranged 
in the surface of the material such that the density of the 
regions on the surface is variable across said surface. 
Preferably, the surface of the light transmissive material is 
substantially planar. The surface may be comprised of a thin 
wafer of silicon. Each region of the surface may be a bore. Each bore may have 
a width less than approximately one-tenth to one-thirtieth of 
the wavelength of radiation transmissible through the surface. Each bore may also be a hole extending through the surface. 
The holes may have a width less than approximately one-tenth 
to one-thirtieth of
