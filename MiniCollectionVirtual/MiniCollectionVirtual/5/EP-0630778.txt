<ABSTRACT>
A cushion member (12) is provided along back surfaces 
of a crotch belt (9) upwardly extending from a seat 

surface (7) and a buckle (11) mounted on its end. Due to 
toughness of the cushion member (12), the crotch belt (9) 

is made self-sustainable. Thus, a shoulder belt (4) can 
be easily attached to/detached from the buckle (11), to 

feel comfortable to a child.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a child safety seat 
for an automobile. In general, a child safety seat for an automobile 
comprises a crotch belt which is locatable between the 
thighs of a child seated in the seat to upwardly 
extend from a surface of the seat, and shoulder belts 
which extend from a backrest portion and are passable 
along the child's shoulders. A buckle is mounted on an 
end of the crotch belt so that the shoulder belts may 
be detachably coupled to the buckle. The safety seat 
may also comprise hip belts which are passed along the 
child's hips, to be also detachably coupled to the 
buckle. The hip belts may be integrally formed with 
the shoulder belts. The aforementioned shoulder belts and the like are 
coupled to the buckle after the child is seated on the  
 
child safety seat for an automobile. The shoulder belts 
and the like are detached from the buckle when the child 
is helped out from the seat. Before the child is seated on the aforementioned 
child safety seat for an automobile, the crotch belt is in 
an arbitrary state on the seat surface, for example. In 
other words, the crotch belt may be bent in any form, or 
twisted. Therefore, the buckle which is mounted on the 
end of the crotch belt is in any position and any state on 
the seat surface, for example, while arbitrarily directing 
its front and back sides. When the child is seated in this state, the crotch 
belt and the buckle may be located under the buttocks of 
the child, causing discomfort. In order to avoid this, 
the user must separate the crotch belt and the buckle from 
the seat surface before seating the child, so that the 
same are not located under its buttocks. If the crotch 
belt and the buckle are undesirably located under the 
buttocks of the child, the user must draw out the buckle 
from under its buttocks with the crotch belt. Such 
operations are relatively troublesome. Further, the user must confirm the front and back 
sides of the buckle are in front of the body of the child, to 
couple the shoulder belts and the like to the same. 
However, the crotch belt which is provided with the buckle  
 
is so easily twisted to reverse the buckle that the user 
simply holding the buckle may have to turn over the same 
for coupling the shoulder belts thereto. In this case, 
the user must turn over the buckle in a direction for 
returning the crotch belt as twisted to its original 
state. This also complicates the operation for coupling 
the shoulder belts to the buckle. Even if the buckle is facing in a
