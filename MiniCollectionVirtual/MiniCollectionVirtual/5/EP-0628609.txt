<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a coated particulate inorganic 
material, the coating on the particles of the inorganic 

material comprising a combination of a natural or 
synthetic polymeric material and a mould release agent. 

The mould release agent is a fatty acid having from 12 
to 20 carbon atoms or a heavy metal or alkaline earth 

metal salt thereof. The polymeric material is present 
in the coating in an amount of from 1% to 10% by 

weight, based on the weight of dry inorganic material. 
The coated particulate inorganic material is 
useful as an improved low profile additive for 

polymeric compositions, and especially for 
thermosetting polymeric compositions which are 

specially adapted for forming shaped articles by sheet 
moulding or by bulk, or dough, moulding processes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an improved low profile
additive for
thermosetting polymeric compositions which are
specially adapted for forming shaped articles by sheet
moulding or by bulk, or dough, moulding processes, to a
process for preparing the improved additive, and to
polymeric compositions (particularly thermosetting
polymeric compositions) incorporating the additive.Sheet moulding compounds (SMC) and bulk moulding
compounds (BMC) generally contain a thermosetting
polymeric material which may be, for example, an
unsaturated polyester resin, an epoxy resin, a vinyl
ester resin or a phenolic resin. In the case of the
unsaturated polyester resins, the compound contains, in
addition to the polyester, an unsaturated alkylbenzene
cross-linking agent, for example styrene, a peroxide
catalyst, a filler and a fibrous reinforcing material
such as glass fibre. The moulding compounds are
generally formed into shaped articles, either three-dimensional
bodies or sheets, by heating the
composition to a temperature in the range from 120 to
180°C and moulding the shaped article in a press at a
pressure of about 4MPa.As these moulding compounds cure, or cross-link,
in the mould they tend to contract, with the result
that cracks or voids can form in the body of the shaped
article. There is also a tendency for the compound to
withdraw slightly from the walls of the mould with the
result that the surface finish of the shaped article is
impaired. The reinforcing glass fibres may become
partially exposed at the surfaces of the shaped
article, giving the surface a rough feel and an
unattractive appearance.In order to overcome this problem an additive
known as a "low profile additive" is often included in 
the moulding compound. In the case of unsaturated
polyester resins, this is usually an elastomeric or
thermoplastic polymeric material which is soluble in
the cross-linking agent for the unsaturated polyester
resin, but does not itself necessarily cross-link. The
elastomeric or thermoplastic polymeric material may be,
for example, a natural rubber, a natural rubber which
has been substituted with functional groups, a
synthetic rubber, an acrylic copolymer, a poly(vinyl
acetate) or a copolymer of vinyl acetate. If an
appropriate amount of a low profile additive of one of
the above types is included in the moulding compound it
is found that the low profile additive expands in the
mould, and that this expansion can compensate for the
contraction of the unsaturated polyester resin, with
the result that the compound as a whole
