<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cylinder head lubricating system of 
an internal combustion engine comprising a cylinder head, an 
intake and exhaust camshaft having cam lobes for operating a 
plurality of intake and exhaust valves, said intake and exhaust 
camshaft being supported in the cylinder head by intake and 
exhaust camshaft bearings, an oil pump, a first and a second 
lubricant conduit means extending to the intake and exhaust 
camshaft bearings respectively, wherein the length of the 
first lubricating conduit means from the oil pump to the intake 
camshaft bearings is shorter than the length of the second 
lubricating conduit means from the oil pump to the exhaust 
camshaft bearings. The use of overhead valves operated by overhead mounted 
camshafts is well known. Although there are some advantages to 
direct valve actuation, the use of a rocker arm actuator has the 
advantage of permitting the incorporation of a hydraulic lash 
adjuster. Conventionally it has been the practice to supply 
lubricant to the lash adjusters for their operation and to the 
journals of the associated camshaft in a series flow 
relationship. Although this has the advantage of simplicity, it 
has certain disadvantages. Specifically, with a series flow 
arrangement when the engine is turned off, the fact that the 
camshaft journals are open to the atmosphere will cause leak down 
of the lubricant. That is, because the cam journals are 
generally open, the system does not maintain pressure and 
lubricant can drain down back through the series flow arrangement  
 
into the lubricant reservoir through the oil pump. This means 
that the lubricant in the lifters will become depleted when the 
engine is shut down. This can give rise to obvious difficulties 
on restarting. As has been noted, the normal arrangement for an 
engine having a camshaft and hydraulic lash adjusters is to 
supply lubricant through a common conduit from the lubricant 
pump to the lash adjusters and the cam journals. Frequently the 
engine may employ two camshafts, each of which operates its own 
series of valves through an actuating mechanism that includes its 
own series of lash adjusters. With the type flow arrangement 
previously proposed, the pressure of the lubricant supplied to 
the lash adjusters will depend upon its distance from the 
lubricant pump and this means that the adjusters associated with 
one camshaft may receive lubricant at a substantially lower 
pressure than those associated with the other camshaft. From EP-A-0 212 981 an oil
