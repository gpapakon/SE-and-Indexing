<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic tape cartridge having a slidably 
attached shutter. In a first embodiment, bent 

portions are provided above and below a front wall 
portion of the shutter as curved or inclined surfaces. 

The head-inserting opening formed in the front wall of 
the shutter terminates short of the curved or inclined 

surfaces. In a second embodiment, the upper and lower 
shutter portions are separate and are fitted to the 

cartridge body separately. The upper and lower 
portions are then connected to each other. In a third 

embodiment, a hub-rotation preventing device is formed 
from a synthetic resin separately from the shutter and 

later attached to the shutter. In a fourth 
embodiment, a recess is formed in shutter or the case 

body, and a corresponding fitting projection is formed 
in the shutter or the case body so that the recess and 

the projection mate when the shutter is in a closed 
position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic tape 
cartridge having a thin plate-shaped shutter slidably 
secured on the cartridge body. The shutter covers a 
magnetic head-inserting window, pockets through which 
pinch rollers are inserted, and hub holes, all of 
which are provided in a box-shaped cartridge formed by 
upper and lower cartridge halves. In recent years, a magnetic tape cartridge, 
generally known as a digital compact cartridge (DCC), 
has been used for recording information such as music 
and images by means of digital signals. One example 
of such a conventional magnetic tape cartridge is 
shown in Figs. 28-33. As shown in Fig. 28, this conventional magnetic 
tape cartridge includes a cartridge body 1 
accommodating therein a magnetic tape or the like, a 
shutter 2 which is slidably attached to the cartridge 
body 1, and a spring 3 interposed between the 
cartridge body 1 and the shutter 2 to urge the shutter 
2 in a closed direction. The cartridge body 1 is substantially box-shaped 
and comprises a pair of upper and lower cartridge 
halves 4, 5 formed by injection molding a synthetic 
resin. Accommodated therein are a pair of reel hubs 
6 around which a magnetic tape (not shown) is wound, 
guide rollers for guiding the magnetic tape as it is  
 
wound around the reel hubs 6, and various other 
components. In addition, the following portions of the 
cassette are formed in a bottom wall portion 7 of the 
lower cartridge half 4: hub holes 8 which permit tape 
drive shafts (hub drive shafts) in a digital 
recording/reproducing apparatus to be inserted in the 
reel hubs 6; a spring-loading recess 9 for 
accommodating the spring 3; a bottom guide groove 10 
extending in a longitudinal direction of the cartridge 
(in the direction of arrow A in Fig. 28) for 
restricting the sliding movement of the shutter 2; and 
bottom-retaining pieces 11 extending over the bottom 
guide groove 10 to retain an edge of the shutter 2 in 
the groove 10. As shown in Fig. 30, an upper guide groove 15 
extending in the longitudinal direction of the 
cartridge for restricting the sliding direction of the 
shutter 2 in the same way as the above-described 
bottom guide groove 10, is formed in an upper wall 
portion 14 of the upper cartridge half 5. In 
addition, although not shown, a window made of a 
transparent resin is provided in the upper wall 
portion 14 of the upper cartridge half 5 so the user 
can visually confirm the amount of magnetic tape wound 
around each reel hub 6 inside the cartridge body 1. As shown
