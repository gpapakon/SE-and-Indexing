<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optical memory disks and more particularly 
to readers of optical memory disks with enhanced data densities and 
enhanced throughput. More particularly, the invention relates to optical disk 
readers which utilize wide area illumination sources. Optical disks of various kinds are made of circular plates with reflecting 
coating material which have concentric circular or spiral tracks on which the 
data is written in the form of spots of changes of some optical property of the 
disk coating media. These changes are typically spots of lower reflection than 
the non data-containing parts of the disk. These data spots are spread along 
a spiral or circular path on the disk. The disk is divided into sectors, and 
each loop of this spiral path that lies within a sector is called a track. Data is read from the optical disk by an electro optical head which projects a 
high brightness focused laser beam on the rotating disk. The reflected light 
from the disk is detected and transduced into an electrical signal. At any 
point in time the electro-optical head reads one data spot. Rotation of the 
disk enables reading a track spot by spot. In order to read data from inner or 
outer tracks, the electro-optical head is moved to the desired track position by 
a motor. The reading of the data is done serially along a spiral path.  Data transfer rates of commercially available CD-ROMs (Compact Disk - 
Read Only Memory) is about 157 KByte/sec. CD-ROMs memory storage 
capacity is limited to about 640 MBytes (see, e.g., the publication E-93176 
PDO-0032, 4/87 to Philips and DuPont Optical). The limit of the memory 
storage capacity is a function of the wavelength and the numerical aperture 
of the objective lens. One known way to increase memory capacity in all sorts 
of optical memory disks, such as CD-ROMs, WORM (Write Once Read Many) 
disks, and magneto-optical disks, is to decrease the wavelength of the light 
emitted by the diode laser which illuminates the data tracks of the optical 
memory disk. Wavelength reduction results in smaller data spots on the disk 
and thus leads to higher resolutions and enhanced data densities. Current 
CD-ROMs employ wavelength of 780 nanometer (nm). The advent of new diode lasers which emit, for example, blue light (around 
481 nm) raises the potential of enhancing optical disk data density. However, 
blue light diode lasers still emit low energies which are not(yet)suitable for 
the process of reading/writing on an optical disk. Moreover, they are
