<ABSTRACT>
A probe (6) is displaced relative to a recording 
medium (8) according to a drive voltage. A chip (7) is 

provided at an end of the probe (6). The chip (9) serves 
to form pits and projections on a surface of the recording 

medium (8) according to a recording voltage (Vp2) and 
serves to output a current signal responsive to the pits 

and projections with a reproducing voltage (Vp1) applied. 
A voltage generator (14, 15) generates the recording 

voltage and the reproducing voltage based on address and 
data signals. A sample-hold unit (20, 21) samples at a 

specified frequency a current signal obtained from a no-recording 
area (9) of the recording medium by the chip (7) 

and produces an output voltage signal. A reproducing unit 
(16) demodulates and reproduces increment and decrement of 

the current signal obtained from a recording area (10) of 
the recording medium by the chip (7). A control unit (22) 

controlles recording and reproduction. The control unit 
outputs such a drive voltage that the interval between the 

chip (7) and the recording medium (8) is maintained 
constant by feedback control based on the voltage signal 

derived from the sample-hold unit (20, 21). The control 
unit controlles the recording so that no-recording areas 

(9) and recording areas (10) are arranged alternately.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording and
reproducing apparatus for performing the recording process
by forming microscopic pits and projections on a substrate
surface with a recording voltage applied to a probe brought
in proximity to the substrate surface, and for performing
the reproduction process by detecting a current that flows
according to the pits and projections through the probe
brought in proximity to the substrate surface. The
invention also relates to a high-density recording medium
for the recording and reproducing apparatus.Conventionally, the so-called STM (Scanning
Tunnel Microscope), which detects the pits and projections
of the surface by detecting a tunnel current developed when
a microscopic probe is brought in close proximity to the
substrate surface, has been used for fine evaluation of
surface shape. In more recent years, further attempts have
been made to implement the recording by forming pits and 
projections of the atomic order on the substrate surface by
using the STM.Generally, the STM has the following arrangement.
As shown in Fig. 5, piezoelectric elements 27, 28, 29 are
arranged in a cylindrical shape, and a chip 31 is located
at an end of an actuator 30 that will be displaced axially
by drive voltages applied to those piezoelectric elements.
The pits and projections of the surface are measured by
detecting a tunnel current that will flow when the chip is
brought in proximity to the surface of the recording
medium.In this arrangement, a large current, when flowed
through the chip, allows microscopic crater-like pits to be
made in the surface of the recording medium, whereby the
recording can be accomplished. The recording can be done
also by making use of variations in the magnetized state or
dielectric constant of the recording medium or the like,
not only by making crater-like pits. Detailed description
of these aspects can be found in literatures (e.g., NIKKEI
MICRODEVICES, July 1991, p. 89).Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. 4-206536
describes an attempt to provide a recording
apparatus using the principle of the STM. In this example,
a structure having a plurality of chips arranged one by one
is mounted on a piezoelectric element, and the chips are 
driven in a parallel fashion so that signal recording and
reproduction is attained.Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 4-157644
describes a method in which the STM chip is mounted
on a floating type slider used for the recording on
magnetic hard disks, whereby recording is enabled.
