<ABSTRACT>
In the initial region of the drying section, at least one of the dryer groups (23) is designed as a single-felt dryer group, in which a single endless felt (S) and the web (9) run alternately over cylinders (73) and over suction deflection rolls (73'). In the end region of the drying section, at least one two-felt dryer group (24) is provided, in which the web (9) runs alternately over lower (74) and upper cylinders (74'). The single-felt dryer group (23) has an automatic rope-less tail- guiding device (76, 79) for threading the so-called tail. An automatic rope-less tail-guiding device (77, 78) is likewise present in the two-felt dryer group (24).
