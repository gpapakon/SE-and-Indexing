<ABSTRACT>
This apparatus comprises a light entrance surface, a diffused light exit surface, and a diffused light guide of a 
volume area having a uniform diffusing power. The value E [cm⁻¹]
, of the effective diffusion illumination parameter 
of the guide is 0.45 ≦ E ≦ 100. In the correlation functional approximate expression, (r) = exp [-r/a]
, expressing the 
uneven refractive index structure of the guide, the correlation distance a is 0.01 µm ≦ a ≦ 50 µm. No diffusing layer 

of diffusive ink need to be formed on the back side of the guide. When an element for correcting the direction of 
the light outgoing from the light exit light surface, having a serrated surface is provided on the light exit surface, it is 

possible to increase the light traveling in a specific direction. The uneven refractive index structure can be produced 
by kneading a polymer matrix and a granular material having a different refraction index, by kneading two or more 

polymers having different refractive indecies, or by dispersing a granular material by suspension polymerization. The 
material having such a structure is then molded and used as the guide.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a light-scattering
light-guiding device equipped with a light-scattering
light guide capable of radiating scattered light toward
the surroundings while guiding the light and, more
particularly, to a light-scattering light-guiding device
especially adapted for use as a back light source for a
liquid crystal display (LCD), and employing a light-scattering
light guide having a volume region to which
substantially uniform scattering power given.Various optical elements and devices, which are
designed to guide and direct light in a desired
direction by making use of a scattering phenomenon have
been heretofore well known and used as back light
sources for liquid crystal displays and so forth.One type of these well-known optical elements and
devices uses a two-dimensional light source comprising
an elongated plate of a transparent material, wherein
light is allowed to enter from one side of the plate of
the transparent material and a reflective element is
disposed on one surface of the plate while light-scattering
property is provided on the other side
surface to be used as a light exit surface; this light
source is used, for example, as a backlight source for a
liquid crystal display. This type is described for
example, in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 235905/1987,
63083/1988, 13925/1990 and 245787/1990.In the two-dimensional light source using such a 
light-scattering light-guiding devices, light is not
scattered in three dimensions inside a transparent body,
but is allowed to spread the direction of outgoing
light, by utilizing irregular reflection or specular
reflection near the surface of the transparent body or
on the reflective element. Therefore, it is difficult,
in principle, to sufficiently increase the proportion of
scattered light which can be taken from the light-scattering
light-guiding device.Where a two-dimensional light source which
introduces light from a side and has a uniform
illumination intensity should be obtained, the
reflecting power of the reflective element must have a
certain gradient, as can be easily understood from the
above-cited references. This makes the structure of the
light-scattering light-guiding devices complex and
bulky. Consequently, the manufacturing cost increases
inevitably.Thus, where this kind of light-scattering light-guiding
device is used as a backlight source for a
liquid crystal display or the like, some of various
requirements such as brightness, the uniformity of the
illumination intensity of the two-dimensional light
