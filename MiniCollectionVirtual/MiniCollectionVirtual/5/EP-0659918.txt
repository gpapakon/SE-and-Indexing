Feeding device for travelling yarns, in particular for use on textile machines like
looms, having a storage drum (11) to which the yam is supplied in a rearward

region by means of a yarn guide tube (9) which revolves around the storage drum
and from which the yam is withdrawn overhead through a yarn withdrawal eyelet

(19) and wherein an automatic threading of the yarn (F) is effected by means of
compressed air in a manner wherein the yam (F) is first of all blown through the

yarn guiding tube (9), deflected on a mouth side thereof parallel to the coat
surface of the storage drum and conducted on an end side thereof below bristles

of a braking ring (26) which leaves an open gap towards the coat surface of the
storage drum, radially inwardly up into a region of the withdrawal eyelet (19), the

latter being formed as an axial suction-blast nozzle, 
characterised in that
 the
braking ring (26) is moved away by means of a compressed-air cylinder (22) and

is returned by spring force, that a supply line (57) leading to the compressed-air
cylinder (22) is connected to a distributor (53) and a common valve (52) which

also serves to supply the suction-blast nozzle, that in case of an opening control
of the valve (52) a simultaneous pressurised air supply is initiated both for the

supply of the suction-blast nozzle and also the pressurised-air cylinder (22), by
means of which the braking ring (26) is displaced into the release position defining

said gap, and that after threading the yarn (F) the pressurised air supply to the
pressurised-air cylinder (22) for the supply of the suction-blast nozzle is to be

interrupted by means of the valve (52), and that the braking ring (26) is returned

by the spring force into its home position, such that the braking ring (26) is moved
away controllably parallel to the supply of the suction-blast nozzle and is

returnable.
Feeding device as in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the radial inwardly oriented
deflection towards the yam withdrawal eyelet (19) of the yam tip freely flying in a

plane vertically above the yam withdrawal eyelet exclusively achieved by means
of an air stream lying on the coat surface of a head cone (16) provided at a

storage drum side, and that the tip of the head cone (16) at the storage drum side
is directed towards the free cross-section of the yam withdrawal eyelet. 
Feeding device as in claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the bristles (30) are aligned
corresponding to the coat surface (M) of the head cone (16).
