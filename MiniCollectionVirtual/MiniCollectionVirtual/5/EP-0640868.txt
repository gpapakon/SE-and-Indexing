<ABSTRACT>
A camera system is disclosed that optically 
records audio information on a photographic film 

containing corresponding image information. The camera 
system includes a user interface coupled to a camera 

control processor (34), a recording circuit coupled to the 
camera control processor (34) and a microphone (20), an optical 

encoding circuit (38) having an input coupled to the output 
of the recording circuit and an output coupled to an 

optical write head (30), a shutter mechanism (24), and a 
transport mechanism (48) for advancing film past the shutter 

mechanism and the optical write head (30). In operation, 
the camera control processor (34), in response to command 

signals received from the user interface (14), controls the 
operation of the recording circuit, the optical 

encoding circuit (38), the optical write head (30), the shutter 
mechanism (24) and the transport mechanism (48), to record audio 

segments of variable duration and to encode the audio 
segments as audio film frames of variable lengths 

adjacent to corresponding picture film frames when the 
transport mechanism advances film past the optical 

write head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates in general to
apparatus for optically recording audio information on
photographic film. More specifically, the invention
relates to photographic still cameras that record audio
information in an audio film frame adjacent to a
corresponding picture film frame, wherein the length of
each audio film frame is varied based on the amount of
audio information to be recorded.Image information systems have recently been
introduced in which photographic film images are
scanned and stored in digital form on optical compact
storage discs (CD's) for subsequent reproduction and
display. The optical storage discs can be utilized to
store audio information as well as image information.
It is therefore desirable to provide a system in which
audio information corresponding to the photographic
film image is recorded when the photographic image is
exposed, so that the photographic film image and the
recorded audio information can subsequently be stored
together on the storage disc.One approach to recording audio information
related to a photographic image would be to provide a
camera with a sound recording system that records the
audio information on an audio storage medium. The
sound storage medium could take the form of a magnetic
tape, a magnetic information storage disc, or a
semiconductor memory that can be detached from the
camera and sent with a film roll to a processing 
facility. The processing facility would then develop
the film image, scan the film image to create digitized
image data, and store the digitised image data on the
storage disc. The audio information contained on the
sound storage medium corresponding to the film roll
would also be recorded onto the storage disc.There are a number of problems associated with the
use of a separate audio recording medium to record the
audio information as described above. The complexity
and expense of the photographic camera system, for
example, increases due to the requirement of providing
a separate audio recording medium within the camera
structure. The audio recording medium can also become
separated from the photographic film at several
different points in the overall process, thereby
requiring that a tracking system be employed to insure
that the audio recording medium and photographic film
are properly mated prior to recording the image and
audio information on the storage disc.In view of the difficulties associated with the
use of a separate recording medium, it is an objective
of the invention to provide a camera system that
records the
