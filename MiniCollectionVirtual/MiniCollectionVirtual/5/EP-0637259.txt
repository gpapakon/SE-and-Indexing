Fin device comprising a front part forming a blade 
(2), made of a relatively rigid material, and means for 

fastening the blade to the foot of the user, the blade 
(2) being fixed in its rear region under the sole (4) of 

a shoe element (5) made of a material more flexible than 
that of the blade characterized in that at least the 

front part (11) of the shoe element (5) is provided with 
a covering (10) made of a material which is more rigid 

than that of the shoe element, this covering (10) being 
solidly attached to the blade (2) and being capable of 

correctly transmitting momentum from the foot (3) to the 
blade (2). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the covering (10) of the shoe element (5), made of 

a more rigid material, extends under the entire sole (4) 
of the shoe element (5) and rises (14), towards the rear 

part, to surround the heel region. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the blade (2, 6) extends under all or part of the 

sole (4). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the blade (2) includes at least one hole (18) in the 

part (6) intended to be located under the sole (4), in 
particular for allowing injection of the covering (10) or 

of an adhesive. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the shoe element (5), of the slip-on 

boot or bootee type, includes an upright part which 
surrounds the ankle (4) of the foot (3) of the user, this 

part including, towards the top, a tightening belt (19) 
connected to the element (5) by at least two loops (20) 

and allowing the entire periphery of the top part of the 
shoe element (5) to be tightened around the leg of the 

user. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the shoe element (5) is made of 

neoprene or of a material having equivalent mechanical  
 

characteristics, while the covering (10) which joins the 
shoe element (5) to the blade (2) is made of 

thermoplastic rubber or any thermoplastic material whose 
density is less than 1, in order to make the fin unsinkable. 
Device according according to Claim 6, characterized 
in that the tightening belt (19) is made of a band 

of fabric fitted with complementary hooks. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the blade (2) is fitted on each 

side with lateral ridges (15, 16) whose mid-plane is 
substantially orthogonal to the plane of the blade (2), 

the said blade (2) including a longitudinal central rib 
(17) of lesser height than the ridges (15, 16). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the covering (10) which joins the 

shoe element to the fin has a hardness less than or equal 
to that of the blade. 
Method of manufacture of a fin device according 
to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the 

blade and the connecting covering are made by injecting 
a thermoplastic in a single step into a mould containing 

a former on which the shoe element has been placed. 
Method of manufacture of a fin device according 
to one of Claims 1 to 9, by injection in two steps, 

characterized in that: 

in a first step, the blade (2) is manufactured, 
by injection, from a relatively rigid material, while 

making at least one hole (18) in the part of this blade 
intended to be located under the sole (4) of the shoe 

element (5); 
in a second step, the shoe element (5) is 
placed on a former (24) arranged in mould halves (22, 

23), the whole being such that:
 
   a free space (29) is left between the internal 

surface of the cavity of the mould halves and the shoe 
element (5) engaged on the former (24), in the region 

intended to receive the covering (10),
 
   and each half (22, 23) of the mould has an  

 
opening (22
a
, 23
a
), under the sole of the shoe element 
(5), which is intended to be closed by a block (30) 

facing a rear region (6) of the blade (2), 
and the blade (2) is next fitted on the block 
(30) via its rear region (6), the block (30) including a 

duct (31) which is aligned with a hole (18) in the blade 
for injecting the covering material, 
then, after having closed the mould, the said 
covering is injected and spreads into the space (29) 

lying between the former (26), the halves (22, 23) of the 
mould and a region (6) of the blade, and establishes 

connection between the blade (2) and the shoe 
element (5). 
Method according to Claim 10 or 11, characterized 
in that the covering (10) extends under the entire sole 

(4) of the shoe element (5) and rises (14) at the heel, 
this covering (10) joining the rear part of the blade (2) 

continuously.
