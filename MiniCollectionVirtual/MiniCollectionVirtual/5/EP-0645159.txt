<ABSTRACT>
A new catheter stick protector is described having a metal 
flap clip (15) which snaps down into place to prevent return of 

the needle (4) through the protector device once withdrawn. 
The device is small and received over the needle (4) to 

provide an interface between the needle hub (7) and the hub (3) of 
a catheter like product. A sleeve (9) of hydrophobic or fluid 

impermeable material is provided and attached at one end 
to the needle hub (7) and at a second end to the tip 

protector. The length of the material is selected to hold 
the tip protector in a position just extending beyond the 

tip (14) of the needle (4) of a catheter inserter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of medical devices and 
in particular medical apparatus for puncturing the skin 
layer of a patient to emplace a tubular catheter. Essentially catheters and in particular intravenous 
catheters are of two overall types. The first type is a 
through the needle catheter in which the tubular catheter 
product is emplaced in a vein by being carried within a 
tubular needle. Once implanted the needle is withdrawn 
and either split to remove it from the catheter or left in 
a contained condition on the catheter. Through the needle 
catheters, however, are in limited use due to their 
difficulty of use and the difficulty of removing the 
needle. Further the needle being larger than the catheter 
creates a larger opening upon insertion than the outer 
diameter of the catheter. This permits blood leakage 
around the outer area of the catheter unless a swelling 
catheter is used. The second and more prevalent type of catheter is the 
over-the-needle catheter in which a tubular catheter is 
placed over an inserting sharpened cannula or needle. The 
needle is used to pierce the skin and enter the vein of 
the patient and the catheter is thereafter threaded off 
the needle and the needle removed. This permits coupling 
of the catheter to medical equipment.  In an over-the-needle catheter situation, the health care 
worker is exposed to the sharpened tip of the cannula and 
to the surface of the cannula which may be contaminated 
with bodily fluids. Therefore, many efforts have been 
made to protect the health care worker from exposure to 
the risk of this occurrence. U.S. Patent No. 4,725,267 to Vaillancourt relates 
particularly to a post injection needle sheath and not to 
a catheter. The needle sheath encloses the sharpened end 
of a needle which is used with a syringe. The sheath is 
initially in a compact and secured condition on the needle 
hub and has a substantial portion of the needle exposed 
for insertion into a patient or vial. After use the 
sheath is extended over the needle and a cap caps the 
needle in order to prevent puncture of the health care 
worker. U.S. Patent No. 4,747,831 chose an automatic catheter 
device in which the inserting cannula is withdrawn into a 
housing through the operation of a spring. U.S. Patent No. 4,762,516 describes an assembly of a 
needle catheter protector. This assembly comprises an 
elongated housing which mounts to the needle. A needle 
guard is slidably mounted within the housing and is 
adapted to be moved forward along the
