<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improvement to the assay for protein 
in urine involving the use of a molybdate or tungstate 

salt and an indicator dye which forms a complex 
with molybdate or tungstate whose absorption band is 

shifted in the presence of protein. The improvement 
involves the use of an ionizable phosphate containing 

compound characterized by the formula: 

to reduce background interference caused by constituents 
normally present in urine.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various methods for the determination of protein
in aqueous fluid have been reported in the literature.
These methods include the Kjeldahl method, biuret method,
Lowry method, dyestuff combination method, UV method
and fluorometric method. Widely used methods for
the assay of urinary protein are the Kingbury-Clark
method; reported in J. Lab. Clin. Med., 11, 981 (1926);
the Exton method; reported in Rinsho Byori, 15, 699
(1967); Merlemans method; reported in Clin. Chim. Acta,
5, 757 (1960) and the Coomassie brilliant blue method;
reported in Anal. Biochem., 72, 248 (1976).In general, protein interacts with various substances,
particularly with dyes such as bromphenol
blue, coomassie brilliant blue and eosine as well as
metal ions such as silver (I), copper (II), zinc (II)
and lead (II). Typically, the addition of protein to
the reaction between a dye and a metal ion gives a
spectral change to a dye-metal ion solution. Fujita et
al report in Bunseki Kagaku Vol. 32, Pp. E379-E386 that
the addition of protein to the reaction between pyrogallol
red and molybdenum (VI) produces a different
spectrum than that of the pyrogallol red-molybdenum 
(VI) complex solution. These authors report that among
metal ions tested, large amounts or iron (II)
interfered with the protein determination and that
among anions tested, organic acids such as citrate,
oxalate and tartrate ions decreased the absorbance at
600 nm. While large amounts of other ions did not
interfere, Fujita et al report that large amounts of
creatinine and amino acids caused a slight increase in
absorbance at 600 nm.Japanese Kokai Patent No. SHO 62(1987)-6170 discloses a
test strip for protein determination comprising a
molybdate salt, a pigment which forms a complex with
molybdate and whose adsorption band is shifted in the
presence of a protein and a chelating agent which
combines with molybdate ions. A similar assay for trace
amounts of protein is disclosed in Japanese Kokai
Patent 61-155757 in which there is described the use of
a chelating agent which is able to bond with molybdenum
or a metal ion which is able to bond with oxalic acid,
citric acid, phosphoric acid or their salts which are
normally present in the test sample. This assay is a
dye binding method using the complex of pyrogallol red
and molybdenum. At low pH the dye-metal complex is red.
The color changes to blue when deprotenated at higher
pH. The protein causes the dye to deprotonate more
easily (at lower pH) by the interaction of positively
charged amino acid groups stabilizing the
