<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an electrified wall panel 
system having a power distribution server locatable 

within a wall panel unit. The power distribution 
server has four receptacle module ports oriented in an 

H-shaped configuration in which a first receptacle port 
on a first side of the wall panel unit opens toward a 

first end of the wall panel unit, a second receptacle 
port on the first side of the wall panel unit opens 

toward a second end of the wall panel unit, a third 
receptacle port on a second side of the wall panel unit 

opens toward the first end of the wall panel unit, and 
fourth receptacle port on the second side of the wall 

panel unit opens toward the second end of the wall 
panel unit. First and second harnesses are each 

electrically connected at first ends thereof to the 
power distribution server, extend to opposite ends of 

the wall panel unit, and include connector ports on the 
second ends thereof for providing electrical 

interconnection of adjacent wall panel units. There is 
also disclosed an electrified wall panel system with 

wall panel connector interchangeably usable with the 
interconnection of two, three, and four wall panel 

units. The connector includes a hook member for 
connecting together adjacent vertical members of frames 

of adjacent wall panel units at a lower portion thereof 
and a draw nut for connecting together adjacent 

vertical members of frames of adjacent wall panel units 
at an upper portion thereof by vertical displacement 

thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to wall
panel systems. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a wall panel system comprising
wall panel units capable of being connected end to end
to form continuous partitions and to an apparatus for
connecting together two, three or four such wall panel
units.Wall panel systems are used extensively in
commercial and industrial settings to define workspace,
provide privacy, control traffic flow, and minimize
noise. Wall panel systems can also provide suitable
structures for use with desks, tables, shelves, trays
a the like as well as with other furniture,
components, equipment and material such as may be used
in a commercial or industrial setting. In addition,
wall panel systems can be advantageously integrated
into the design and decoration of a commercial or industrial
setting.Wall panel systems may be comprised of individual
wall panel units of various types and sizes.
Wall panel units may be full height floor-to-ceiling
walls or may be walls of less than floor-to ceiling
height, or may be comprised of a combination of such
walls of varying heights. Wall panel units may totally
enclose or only partially enclose specific areas depending 
upon the particular needs of the site. An advantage
of wall panel systems of this type is that they
can be reconfigured relatively easily compared to
permanent wall structures (such as studs and drywall,
plaster, or concrete).An apparatus for interconnecting two adjacent
wall panels is described in US-A-3,671,063 to comprise
a V-shaped anchor plate. The anchor plate is mounted
within a slot in a bar located between adjacent frames,
both ends of the V in the anchor plate extending
through corresponding slots in the adjacent frames.
Force applied to the bar positively wedges the anchor
plate simultaneously with both frames, thereby locking
the structure together.In using wall panel systems, it is essential
to provide electricity to workstations located in and
around the wall panel units. Present demands for electrical
power consumption may require the provision of
several circuits through a wall panel system. Present
demands may even require the use of one or more
isolated circuits that do not share a neutral or ground
wire with other circuits in order to minimize
electrical interference that might cause problems for
computer or communication systems. Accordingly, it is
desirable that an electric distribution system be
provided with the wall panel system that is easy to
install yet provides a high level of electrical
servic

<CLAIMS>
A wall panel system (10) comprising wall panel
units (12, 14) capable of being connected together end

to end to form continuous partitions, each wall panel
unit (12, 14) comprising one or more vertical members

(16, 18) and one or more horizontal members (24, 26,
28, 30), and an apparatus for connecting together two,

three, or four such wall panel units (12, 14) by
connecting together adjacent vertical members (16, 18)

of adjacent wall panel units (12, 14), the apparatus
comprising a draw nut (326) having at least one

upwardly extending side engagable in a first slot (322)
located at a first height in the vertical member (16)

of a wall panel unit (12); a top plate (308) connected
to said draw nut (326); a fastening means (330)

connectable to said draw nut (326) and capable of
securing said draw nut (326) to a vertical member (16)

of the wall panel unit (12) by vertical displacement of
said draw nut (326) into engagement with the slot

(322); and a hook member (344) having an upwardly
extending end engagable in a second slot (349) located

at a second height in the vertical member (16), the
second slot (349) being vertically displaced from the

first slot (322), characterised in that the apparatus
further comprises a wedge-shaped member (312) connected

to said top plate (308) and engagable by said draw nut
(326) when said draw nut (326) is vertically displaced

into engagement with the slot (322) to thereby
interconnect adjacent wall panels (12, 14).
The apparatus of claim 1 further comprising a
skeletal post (300) locatable between the vertical

members of adjacent wall panel units (12, 14), the top
plate (308) being connected to said skeletal post

(300). 
The apparatus of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
said draw nut (326) comprises a first upwardly

extending side engagable in a first slot (322) located
at a first height in the vertical member (16) of a

first wall panel unit (12); and a second upwardly
extending side engagable in a first slot (322) located

at a first height in the vertical member (18) of a
second wall panel unit (14) adjacent to and

longitudinally aligned with the first wall panel unit
(12), the apparatus being capable of interconnecting

the first and second wall panel units (12, 14) together
by vertical displacement of said draw nut (326) into

engagement with the first slot (322) of the vertical
member (16) of the first wall panel unit (12) and the

first slot (322) of the vertical member (18) of the
second wall panel unit (14).
