<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS AND COMPOSITION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONTROLLED RELEASE GEMFIBROZIL DOSAGE FORM BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to controlled release gemfibrozil formulations. In particular, the present invention is directed to formulations having both immediate and controlled release of gemfibrozil.Gemfibrozil, or 5-(2/5-dimethylphenoxy)-2,2- dimethylpentanoic acid, is a widely used antihyper- lipoproteinemic agent. While apparently absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, maximum absorption appears to occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract, notwithstanding the poor solubility of the drug at acidic pH's.In recent years, for patient convenience, it has become desirable to provide controlled release formulations. In self-medicating patients, where efficacious blood serum levels of the active ingredient are imperative, controlled release formulations are particularly useful. In addition, controlled release formulations are useful for those patients who may easily forget to take medication.One solution for providing controlled and/or extended release of gemfibrozil is set forth in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,925,676. This reference discloses a compressed disintegratable tablet prepared from a gemfibrozil formulation containing a mixture of two separate granulations. The first granulation is prepared with at least one acid-disintegratable binder while the second granulation is prepared by regranulating the first granulation with an alkali-disintegratable ingredient.An alternative solution for providing extended release of gemfibrozil is set forth in commonly-assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,927,639. This patent discloses a compressed tablet containing a disintegratable formulation of gemfibrozil prepared from a mixture of a first and second granulation. The first granulation contains finely divided particles of 

 pure gemfibrozil granulated with at least one cellulose " derivative. The second granulation contains finely divided particles of pure gemfibrozil granulated with a pharmaceutically acceptable water soluble or insoluble polymer which are then uniformly coated with a pharmaceutically acceptable methyl ( eth) acrylate copolymer.In spite of the above-described efforts, it would be advantageous to provide immediate and controlled release gemfibrozil formulations which do not require the labor and production costs associated with preparing multiple granulations. The ability to provide a single granulation which accomplishes both release patterns would result in savings

<CLAIMS>
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A formulation of gemfibrozil providing a loading dose and controlled release of said gemfibrozil, comprising: gemfibrozil particles contacted with a release-control agent in an amount sufficient to provide both immediate and 5 controlled release of said gemfibrozil.
2. The formulation of claim 1, wherein said release- control agent is selected from the group consisting of cellulose phthalates, ethyl cellulose (Aquacoat®), polyvinyl phthalates, cellulose succinates, cellulose butyrates,
_
>
 poly(meth)acrylic acids, partially esterified poly(meth)acrylic acids and mixtures thereof.
3. The formulation of claim 2, wherein the ratio of said gemfibrozil to said release-control agent is from about 11:0.5 to about 11:5 by weight of said dispersion.
4. The formulation of claim 3, wherein the ratio of said gemfibrozil to said release-control agent is from about 11:0.75 to about 11:3 by weight of said dispersion.
5. The formulation of claim 4, wherein the ratio of said gemfibrozil to said release-control agent is from about 11:0.85 to about 11:1.25 by weight of said dispersion.
6. The formulation of claim 1, wherein said gemfibrozil particles are finely divided.
7. The formulation of claim 6, wherein said gemfibrozil particles are blended with an water- disintegratable binder prior to being contacted with said release-control agent.
8. The formulation of claim 7, wherein said water- disintegratable binder is selected from the group consisting of cellulose derivatives, lactose and mixtures thereof. 


 9. The formulation of claim 8, wherein said cellulose derivatives are selected from the group consisting of microcrystalline cellulose, water soluble hydroxyalkyl celluloses and mixtures thereof.
10. A method of preparing a formulation of gemfibrozil having both immediate and controlled release of said gemfibrozil, comprising: contacting gemfibrozil particles with a release-control

 agent present in an amount sufficient to provide both immediate and controlled release of said gemfibrozil from saάd formulation.
11. The method of claim 10, wherein said release- control agent is selected from the group consisting of cellulose phthalates, ethyl cellulose (Aquacoat®), polyvinyl phthalates, cellulose succinates, cellulose butyrates, poly(meth)acrylic acids, partially esterified poly(meth.)acrylic acids and mixtures thereof.
12. The method of claim 11, wherein said gemfibrozil particles are finely divided.
13. The method of claim 12, wherein the ratio of said gemfibrozil to said release-control agent is from about 11:0.5 to about 11:5 by weight.
14. The method of claim 13, wherein the ratio of said gemfibrozil to said release-control agent is from about 11:0.75 to about 11:3 by weight.
15. The method of claim 14, wherein the ratio of said gemfibrozil to said release-control agent is from about 11:0.85 to about 11:1.25 by weight. 


 16. The method of claim 15, wherein said gemfibrozil particles are blended with a water-disentegratable binder prior to being contacted with said release-control agent.
17. The method of claim 16, wherein said water- disintegratable binder is selected from the group consisting of cellulose derivatives, lactose and mixtures thereof.
18. The method of claim 17, wherein said cellulose derivatives are selected from the group consisting of microcrystalline cellulose, water soluble hydroxyalkyl celluloses and mixtures thereof.
19. The method of claim 10, wherein said contacting is achieved by granulation.
20. The method of claim 19, further comprising milling said granulation to a particle size of from about 10 to about 325 mesh.
21. The method of claim 20, further comprising milling said granulation to a particle size of from about 20 to about 200 mesh.
22. A method of preparing a compressed tablet formulation of gemfibrozil having immediate and controlled release of said gemfibrozil comprising:
(a) providing a granulation comprising gemfibrozil i particles granulated with a release-control agent present in an amount sufficient to provide both immediate; and controlled release of said gemfibrozil; and
(b) compressing the granulation obtained as a result of step (a) hereinabove into a tablet form.
