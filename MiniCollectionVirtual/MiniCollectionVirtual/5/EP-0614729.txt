<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clamping device for clamping workpieces on machine tables, apparatuses or pallets by means of tiltably mounted clamping levers. The clamping lever is provided with a pivot joint which possesses a sliding-joint pin. This sliding-joint pin slides in a sliding-joint groove of a rigid housing. The clamping lever performs its tilting movement in dependence on a moving clamping piston, to which it is connected via a ball joint.

<CLAIMS>
Clamping device for clamping workpieces on machine tables, fixtures or 
pallets by means of a clamping lever (1) which is pivoted for tilting and 

hinged on a hydraulically driven clamping piston (2; 20) whose fulcrum is 
supported for displacement in the clamping plane, 
characterized in
 that 
said clamping lever (1) is guided in a rigid main body (6; 21) whose upper 

portion has a configuration in the form of a yoke end, and that sliding 
joint grooves (12; 22) are formed in an open manner, on either side, on 

the inner sides of said yoke end, in which a flattened sliding joint pin (4) 
of said clamping lever (1) is guided for displacement. 
Clamping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that said clamping 
piston (20) takes a sloping position in said rigid main body (21), and 

that said sliding joint groove (22) is inclined at a corresponding angle relative 
to said clamping surface (11), and that the center line passing through 

said sliding joint groove (22) is orthogonal with respect to the angle bisector 
of the angle between said clamping surface (11) of the center of the 

sliding joint and the center of the ball pin (23). 
Clamping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 th
a
t said ball pin 
(3) carries a pin (14) supported in a bore (13) of said clamping lever (1), 

and that said bore (13) in said clamping lever (1) is inclined at an angle 
relative to said clamping surface (11).  

 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
 that in the 
clamped condition the center of said ball pin (3) is located approximately 

on the center line of said sliding joint groove (12) and cooperates with the 
center of said sliding joint pin (4) and said clamping surface (11) so as to 

form a straight line. 
Clamping device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that said rigid 
main body (6; 21) presents an external thread. 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that said 
rigid main body (6; 21) has a cup-shaped configuration and is provided 

with fastening holes. 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in
 that said 
clamping lever (1) is provided with a spherical segment (18) having two 

lateral lugs, into which pin-receiving bores are drilled in a direction central 
on the center of said spherical cup. 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in
 that said 
clamping piston (2) is formed as a cup (16) at its upper end. 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in
 that said 
clamping lever (1) is formed as a sphere at the end at which the force is 

introduced via clamping pistons (2) 
Clamping device according to Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in
 that main 
body presents a cavity for fastening elements on its side facing the workpiece.
