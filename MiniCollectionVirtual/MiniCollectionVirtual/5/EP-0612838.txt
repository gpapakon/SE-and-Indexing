<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a lubricant composition for use in 
two-cycle internal combustion engines. Most two-cycle engines are lubricated by a "once-through" 
system, where new oil is introduced to the engine internal surfaces 
for only a brief period of time. As the engine operates, the oil 
becomes evacuated out the exhaust. However, additional new oil is 
introduced to the engine at the rate which the used oil is evacuated. 
In this way, a continual supply of new oil is fed into the two-cycle 
engine, allowing the fresh oil to lubricate the engine momentarily 
before being expelled in the exhaust. Since the oil expelled in the 
exhaust never returns to the engine, this lubrication circuit is 
called a "once-through" system. Such a system is in marked contrast 
to the typical lubricant circuit of a four-cycle engine, where the oil 
remains in the engine for an extended time, and is circulated between 
the engine internal surfaces and the reservoir many times. In order to lubricate all internal parts of a two-cycle 
engine, it is traditional to mix the lubricating oil with the fuel. 
Such fuel and oil mixing is done at a preferred ratio of between 10 to 
250 parts of fuel to one part of oil. The fuel and oil are then mixed 
with air in a desired ratio of less than about 15 parts of air to one 
part fuel/oil. The resulting fuel/oil/air mixture is combustible and 
is introduced to the engine for burning. Since this combustible 
mixture is exposed to all rolling/sliding interfaces within the 
engine, the lubricating oil is effectively supplied to all points 
within the engine where wear is likely to take place. A requirement 
for such two-cycle engine oils, therefore, is that the oil must mix  
 
freely with the fuel, since only if this happens effectively will the 
lubricating oil be transported to all rubbing surfaces of the engine. To ensure that the lubricating oil can mix freely with fuel, 
two-cycle engine oils must have excellent miscibility with gasoline, a 
property which distinguishes them from most other lubricating oils. 
To achieve excellent miscibility with gasoline, two-cycle engine oils 
are traditionally comprised of -65-75% base oil, -5-30% solvent, with 
the remainder comprising an additive package. The incorporation of 
the solvent in the two-cycle oil provides the necessary fluidity and 
miscibility for the oil to mix freely with the fuel. The addition of 
the solvent, however, imparts other less desirable properties to the 
oil. An example is that the flash point of the lubricating
