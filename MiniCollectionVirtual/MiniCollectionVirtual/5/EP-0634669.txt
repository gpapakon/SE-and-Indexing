<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for classifying and/or identifying an object, for example satellites, aircraft, land vehicles and ships. In this case, the track data of the object were determined first, for example with the aid of a radar system, and, from this, the type and aspect of the object are determined using a reference object. This aspect is superimposed on an ISAR image. Subsequent evaluation of the superimposed images enables accurate and reliable classification and/or identification of the object. The invention also relates to an application of the method.

Method for the classification of an object with the aid of a Doppler 
radar installation, wherein 


a video signal is produced initially by coherent signal processing of 
the radar echo signals emanating from the object, 
an ISAR (inverse synthetic aperture radar) image is produced from the 
video signal, 
at least the track data of position and changes in position are 
ascertained from the video signal for the object and 
a classification in respect of the kind of the object takes place by 
evaluation of the ISAR image and of the track data, characterised 

thereby, 
that the spatial axis of rotation of the object is ascertained from 
the track data thereof, 
that a reference object, which corresponds at least approximately with 
the actual radar target, is chosen from a sele
ction of stored possible 
reference objects with the aid of the track data and the spatial axis 

of rotation, 
that the reference object is rotated into a spatial position 
corresponding with the spatial axis of rotation and the ISAR image of 

the object, 
that a representation of the rotated reference object is superimposed 
on the ISAR image of the object and 
that the classification of the object takes place by a comparison of 
the representation of the rotated reference object with the ISAR 

image. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby, that the ISAR 
image is produced as two-dimensional radar image. 
Method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised thereby, that 
the ISAR image is produced with the aid of a pulse Doppler radar 

installation.  
 
Method according -to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the ISAR image is produced with the aid of a mobile radar 

installation. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised 
thereby, that the ISAR image is produced with the aid of an on-board 

radar installation of an aircraft. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims for use for the 
classification and/or identification of an aircraft. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5 for use for the 
classification and/or identification of a ship. 
Method according to onee of the claims 1 to 5 for use for the 
classification and/or identification of a land vehicle. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 to 5 for use for the 
classification and/or identification of an unco-operative road user.
