<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connector (10) has first and 
second separable contacting electrodes (12, 14) which 

do not generate an arc on making or breaking. A member 
(44) interrelates one of the electrodes (14) via a 

spring-loaded drive cap (24) at ground potential, which 
member 44 is constructed of a material a wide range of 

electrical resistance (e.g., insulator to substantial 
short) inversely response to the magnitude of electric 

field across the member. On electrode preparation, the 
drive cap (24) establishes a relative movement of the 

member (44) with respect to the electrode (14) reducing 
the member material thickness to such a point that the 

electric field across the intervening member material 
reduces the electrical resistance to a desired low 

level (e.g., short to ground).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
separable electrodes arranged in an electrical circuit, 
and, more particularly, to such electrodes with means 
for eliminating or suppressing arcing on connecting and 
disconnecting of the electrodes. It is well known that a device having parts 
physically interrupting an electrical circuit can be 
subject to arcing in the region of interruption which 
can damage the device or severely impair its operation. 
Exemplary of but some of the devices which experience 
this difficulty are relay points, circuit switches, and 
plug and receptacle connectors. Even if the voltages and currents handled by 
the circuit are maintained at a relatively low level, 
repeated making and breaking of the device parts, with 
resulting low level arcing, can have a cumulative 
undesirable effect. Specifically, such arcing 
substantially shortens the life of the device part 
make/break surface due to deterioration of the contact 
surfaces and also can induce undesirable interference 
in the operation of interconnected equipment. Pitting  
 
and welding of the contacting surfaces from arcing, for 
example, can also produce electrical circuit 
difficulties or malfunction. It is not an unusual requirement that a device 
for interrupting an electrical circuit be located in an 
inflammable or combustible environment. Accordingly, 
it is desirable in that case to eliminate or 
substantially reduce arcing so as to avoid the 
possibility of explosion or fire. It is, therefore, a desideratum to provide a 
device for arrangement in an electric circuit having 
parts which make and break circuit connection without 
producing arcing between the parts. It is also 
desirable that such means may be readily adaptable for 
restricted space applications, and be capable of 
operative utilization in a broad range of environments 
and over a substantial ambient temperature range. Unless specifically identified otherwise, the 
terms "electrical connector" or just "connector" as 
used herein shall refer to any device for incorporation 
into an electrical circuit having separable parts which 
are apt to produce arcing on making and breaking 
contact with each other. In the practice of the present invention an 
electrical connector having first and second electrodes 
for interconnection within an electrical circuit 
includes a member interrelating the first and second 
electrodes constructed of a material capable of a wide 
range of electrical resistance resulting from non-linear 
response to the value of an

<CLAIMS>
An electrical connector including a first 
connector part having a pin contact with an end for 

mating connection with a second connector part having a 
socket contact, comprising: 

   an insulative coating on a part of the pin 
contact peripheral surface leaving an outer end portion 

of said pin contact free from said coating to enable 
mating connection with the socket contact; 

   cap means received on said pin contact 
resiliently urged toward the end of said pin contact, 

said cap means being maintained at ground potential; and 
   a body of a material which can exist in a 

first relatively high electrical resistance state when 
subjected to little or no electric field and in a second 

relatively low electrical resistance state when subjected 
to more than a predetermined amount of electric field, 

said body having an opening for sliding receipt of the 
pin contact therewithin and having one end thereof 

conductively and physically secured to the cap means for 
unitary movement therewith; 

   said body providing an interconnection 
between the cap means and the bare end portion of the pin 

contact, and wherein the body exists in said first 
relatively high resistance state when the connector parts 

are mated and the body exists in said second relatively 
low resistance state when the connector parts are 

unmated. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the pin contact, cap means and body are located 

within a tubular housing having an internal shoulder and 
an insulative insert, said cap means being movable 

between the shoulder and insert; and spring means having 
one end contacting the insert and an other end contacting 

the cap means urging said cap means into contact with the 
shoulder when the connector parts are unmated. 
An electrical connector as in claim 2, in 
which the spring means includes a coil spring. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the insulative coating is a Teflon film. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the body is so dimensioned as to continuously 

contact the pin contact as it slides therealong. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the pin is elongated with an axis and the body has 

a uniform wall thickness about the body opening and when 
the connector is unmated substantially a single wall 

thickness of the body separates the cap means and the 
peripheral surface of the pin contact free from 

insulative coating as measured substantially normally to 
the pin longitudinal axis. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the cap means has an opening therein and an end 

portion of the body is ohmically secured within the cap 
means opening for unitary movement therewith. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the body relatively high resistance has a value 

substantially that of an insulator and the body 
relatively low resistance is substantially an electrical 

short. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the body relatively low resistance has some 

prescribed magnitude greater than an electrical short. 
An electrical connector as in claim 1, in 
which the body experiences a transition from the 

relatively high resistance state to the relatively low 
resistance state immediately before the pin and socket 

fully separate from one another.
