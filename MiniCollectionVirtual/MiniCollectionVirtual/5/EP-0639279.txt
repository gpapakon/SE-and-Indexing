<ABSTRACT>
The navigation receiver with coupled-tracking channels is intended for use in radio navigation systems based on trilateration wherein the times of arrival of radio signals transmitted by a plurality of ground- or space-based terminals are measured by a user terminal and utilized by the user terminal in calculating its position and orientation. The coupled-tracking navigation receiver periodically measures carrier phase, carrier frequency, modulation phase, and carrier amplitude for all of the signals arriving at the receiving ports of the receiver and periodically estimates the present values of carrier phase, carrier frequency, and modulation phase for all of the received signals, the estimating process utilizing for each parameter estimate the parameter measurements for a plurality of the received signals properly combined in a statistically appropriate manner by taking into account the relative geometry of the line-of-sight paths, receiver clock time dynamics, and dynamics and motion constraints of the receiver platform, thereby obtaining better performance under poor signal reception conditions and more accurate estimates of carrier phase, carrier frequency, and modulation phase for each of the received signals than independent measurements alone could provide. It follows that these more accurate estimates of the basic signal parameters lead to more accurate estimates of platform position and attitude and the rates of change of these quantities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to radio navigation 
systems and more particularly to systems based on 
trilateration wherein radio signals transmitted by a plurality 
of ground- or space-based terminals are received by a user 
terminal and utilized by the user terminal in calculating its 
position and orientation. Trilateration navigation systems are based on the 
geometrical principle that the position of a point in space is 
uniquely determined by the distances of the point from three 
other suitably-positioned reference points whose locations in 
space are known. Radio navigation systems based on this 
principle utilize transmitting terminals at the reference 
points which transmit signals in which a common time reference 
is embedded. The user terminal, by measuring the time of 
arrival of the reference terminal signals with respect to the 
same common time reference, can determine its range to each of 
the reference transmitting terminals and thereby its position. 
If the user terminal does not have a clock of sufficient 
accuracy for independently keeping track of the common time 
reference, it can, by measuring the time of arrival of signals 
from four reference transmitters, also keep its clock 
synchronized to the common time reference of the reference 
transmitters. The principle can be extended to the measurement of the 
attitude of a platform by utilizing receiving ports at a 
plurality of points on the platform and measuring the 
locations of these points relative to the reference terminals. In general, the navigation data desired includes not only 
position and attitude but also the rates of change of these 
parameters, i.e. linear velocity and angular velocity. To 
achieve these goals, not only must the carrier modulation be  
 
tracked but also the carrier phase and frequency for each of 
the received signals. User receiver systems for trilateration radio navigation 
systems are comprised of an antenna, a receiver "front end" 
for selecting and amplifying the frequency band of interest 
together with "down" converters for translating the radio 
frequency band of interest to an intermediate frequency band 
more suitable for subsequent signal processing, and signal 
processors for extracting the desired information from the 
received signals. Commonly today, the received signals are 
translated to baseband where in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) 
signal samplers and digitizers followed by digital signal 
processors are used to extract range and range rate data from 
the signals. The
