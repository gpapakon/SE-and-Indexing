<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation having as the active
ingredient a cyclosporin derivative that is useful in the treatment of multiple drug
resistance syndrome. In particular this invention relates to a pharmaceutical
formulation that contains ([3'-desoxy-3'-oxo-MeBmt]1-[Val]2-Ciclosporin) as an
active ingredient.The resistance of tumour cells to chemotherapeutics is a major cause in the
failure of chemotherapy. One form of resistance to chemotherapeutics is "multiple
drug resistance" where the tumour cells become cross-resistant to a variety of
chemotherapeutics; for example alkaloids, anthracyclines, actinomyxin D, adriamycin
and colchicine. Multiple drug resistance syndrome has been correlated in many
reports with the overexpression of the transmembrane glycoproteins called P-glycoproteins
(Pgp). Cyclosporins have been found to reverse multiple drug
resistance syndrome and [3'-desoxy-3'-oxo-MeBmt]1-[Val]2-Ciclosporin in particular
has been found to be effective. [3'-desoxy-3'-oxo-MeBmt]1-[Val]2-Ciclosporin and
its utility is described in detail in European patent publication No 296 122.The cyclosporins comprise a class of structurally distinctive, cyclic,
poly-N-methylated undecapeptides, generally possessing pharmacological, in
particular immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory and/or anti-parasitic activity, each
to a greater or lesser degree. Cyclosporins are generally very insoluble in aqueous
media. Consequently, difficulties have arisen in developing pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers which allow delivery of the drug in sufficiently high
concentrations to permit convenient use and which allow efficient and consistent
absorption of the drug by the body. Also specific cyclosporins present very specific
problems in relation to their administration and, in particular, in providing galenic
formulations. Species specific problems also arise with regard to drug bioavailability
and variability in patient dose response. This also applies to the compound
([3'-desoxy-3'-oxo- MeBmt]1-[Val]2-Ciclosporin) which presents very specific
problems in relation to providing galenic formulations containing it. To deal with the general problems of formulating cyclosporins, British patent
application 2 222 770 A discloses galenic formulations, containing cyclosporins, that
are in the form of microemulsions or microemulsion preconcentrates. These
formulations comprise a hydrophilic phase, a lipophilic phase and a surfactant. The
following components for the hydrophilic phase are given: Transcutol,

ethoxylated vegetable oil comprises about 20 % by weight of the carrier medium; the

surfactant comprises about 60 % by weight of the carrier medium; and the hydrophilic phase
comprises about 20 % by weight of the carrier medium.
A pharmaceutical composition according to any preceding claim in which the
hydrophilic phase includes a component selected from Transcutol, Glycofurol and 1,2-propylene

glycol, or mixtures thereof.
A pharmaceutical composition according to claim 5 in which the hydrophilic phase
includes ethanol as a further hydrophilic co-component. 
A pharmaceutical composition according to claim 5 in which the ethanol comprises
0 to 60 % by weight of the hydrophilic phase.

transesterified ethoxylated vegetable oil is a transesterified ethoxylated corn oil.
A pharmaceutical composition according to any preceding claim in which the
surfactant is a reaction product of a natural or hydrogenated castor oil and ethylene oxide, or

is a polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid ester.
A pharmaceutical composition according to any preceding claim for use in the
treatment of multiple drug resistance syndrome in humans.
A process for the production of a pharmaceutical composition as defined in claim 1,
which process comprises mixing together proportions of the hydrophilic phase, the

transesterified ethoxylated vegetable oil, and the surfactant and adding the active ingredient.
