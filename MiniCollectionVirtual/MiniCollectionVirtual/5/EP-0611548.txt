<ABSTRACT>
A device for measuring vital data of a foetus (1) during delivery contains a sensor, in particular for the blood oxygen content, which is fastened to the leading part of the foetus. In order to prevent the arterial blood flow in the tissue of the foetus (1) from being impaired at the measuring point by the fastening of the sensor to the tissue, the sensor is constructed as a somewhat round, curved shell (5) which forms a cavity (6) on its concave side and is subdivided into a fastening zone (10) located at the centre and an elastic edge zone (11) which surrounds said zone and in which light emitters (12) and receivers (13) are arranged. The edge zone (11) of the shell (5) fastened to the tissue rests compliantly in an elastic fashion on the tissue of the foetus.

Sensor device as part of a measurement device with a measurement unit for
measuring vital parameters of a fetus during labor and delivery, especially the oxygen

content of the fetal blood, wherein the sensor device has a carrier with an approximately
round cross-section and with a concavity in which an attachment device is arranged

approximately centrally for attaching the carrier to the presenting part of the fetus and the
carrier (2) is designed as a curved cup (5) forming the concavity (6) on its concave side, 
characterized in
 that the curved cup (5) is subdivided into an attachment zone (10) at
the center and an elastic peripheral zone (11) surrounding the same, in which at least

one light emitter (12) and at least one receiver (13) are arranged, said peripheral zone
being designed as a spring means, whereby the peripheral zone (11) of the cup (5)

attached to the tissue is in flexible spring-loaded contact with the fetal tissue.
Sensor device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the attachment device
is designed and arranged as a spiral wire (7) such that it is embedded with a part shaped

in any desired form in the material of the cup (5) and the other part which is designed as
a spiral (7) projects out of the surface (9) of the concavity (6) by about one turn.
Sensor device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in
 that the attachment device
is represented by an adhesive.
Sensor device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
 that
light emitter (12) and receiver (13) are partially embedded in the material of the cup (5)

and their surfaces are approximately flush with the surface (9) of the concavity (6). 
Sensor device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 that
the material of the cup (5) has a color that is impermeable to the light waves used or has

a color that absorbs such light waves.
Sensor device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in
 that
light emitter (12) and receiver (13) are shielded rearwards inside the cup (5), and the

surface (9) of the concavity (6) has a color that absorbs the light waves used.
Sensor device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in
 that
light emitter (12) and receiver (13) are approximately opposite each other relative to the

center of the cup (5) but they are arranged at an angle not equal to 180Â°.
Sensor device according to Claim 7, 
characterized in
 that two light emitters (12)
and one receiver (13) are provided that are each arranged approximately at a comer

point of a triangle.

characterized in
 that
the diameter of the cup is approximately 14 mm, the thickness of the cup is

approximately 2 mm and the Shore hardness of the material of the cup is approximately
30 Shore.
Sensor device according to at least one of Claims 2 and 4 to 9, 
characterized in

that the cup (5) is provided with a coupling part for a rotating handle in the center of its
convex side.
Sensor device according to Claim 10, 
characterized in
 that the coupling part is
designed as an internal polygon (16). 
Sensor device according to one of Claims 10 and 11,

the material of the cup (5) where it is firmly connected to the spiral wire (7).
Sensor device according to Claim 12, 
characterized in
 that metal plate (15) and
spiral wire (7) are electrically insulated with respect to each other and are each provided

with their own electric line (4).
Sensor device according to at least one of Claims 2 and 4 to 13, 
characterized in

that the free end of the spiral wire (7) is sharpened so that the sharpened surface (18)
points toward the cup (5).
Sensor device according to at least one of Claims 1 to 14, 
characterized in
 that a
tab-shaped ear (19) that projects radially outward beyond the cup (5) is mounted on the

cup in the area of an emitter (12) and/or a receiver (13).
Sensor device according to Claims 10 or 13, 
characterized in
 that the lines (4)
