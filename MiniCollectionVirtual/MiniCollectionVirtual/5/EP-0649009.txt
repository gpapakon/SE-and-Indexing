<ABSTRACT>
A differential pressure transducer is provided in which first and second 
diaphragms (16, 18) are formed within a block of material, such as 

monocrystalline silicon. Each diaphragm carries a support (20, 22) for a 
bridge. The supports (20, 22) are offset from the centre of the 

diaphragms such that deflection of the diaphragms imparts a degree of 
lateral motion to the respective support. The bridge is held within an 

evacuated cavity and the resonant frequency of the bridge is a function 
of the difference in pressure action of the diaphragms.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a differential pressure transducer.WO 8502 677-A discloses a differential pressure sensor in which two
diaphragms are formed in a wafer. The diaphragms act against a fluid
within a closed common cavity so that the deflections of the diaphragms
are a measure of the difference between the pressures acting on the
diaphragms. The deflections of the diaphragms are sensed by capacitive
sensing.US 4 790 102 discloses forming a plurality of diaphragms side by side
within a monolithic structure. Deflection of the diaphragms is monitored
using strain gauges.Electrical sensing techniques as employed in the above-described
arrangements are susceptible to degradation through electrical noise and
may not be suitable for use in hazardous environments. Additionally the
direct measurement of the deflection of a diaphragm may not provide a
high accuracy measurement with good resolution.It has been found that highly accurate pressure measurements may be
obtained by use of a vibrating beam mounted on a sensing diaphragm.
However, due to the need to operate a vibrating beam in a substantially
evacuated chamber, differential pressure sensing has not been possible
with these existing sensors.According to the present invention there is provided a differential 
pressure transducer, comprising first and second diaphragms, a bridge
supported at a first position by a first support movable in response to
deflection of the first diaphragm and at a second position by a second
support movable in response to deflection of the second diaphragm and
arranged such that the force acting on the bridge, and consequently the
resonant frequency thereof, is a function of the difference in deflection of
the first and second diaphragms.Thus the differential pressure is measured by measuring the resonant
frequency of the resonating bridge. Common (shared) pressure causes
the diaphragms to deflect by the same amount and does not give rise to
a substantial change in the force acting on the bridge.Preferably the transducer further comprises means for exciting the bridge
into oscillation and for detecting oscillation of the bridge.Preferably the bridge is contained within a substantially evacuated cavity.
Thus the motion of the bridge is undamped and high Q values can be
obtained, giving rise to good sensitivity and good resolution.Preferably motion of the bridge is sensed optically. Advantageously the
bridge may also be driven optically.Preferably the transducer further comprises a fibre optic cable or an
embedded wave
