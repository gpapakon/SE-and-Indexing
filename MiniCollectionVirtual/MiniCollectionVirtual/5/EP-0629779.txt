<CLAIMS>
Fluid-flow machine in the form of a pump or
turbine, whose surfaces with which flowing liquids are in

contact are provided with a surface structure which is
applied to the surfaces in the form of a fine, sharp-edged

groove structure, the orderly groove structure (9,
10) extending mainly in the direction of flow,

characterized in that a dimensionless groove spacing (s
+
)
and a dimensionless groove height (h
+
) are in the order
of magnitude of h
+
; s
+
 = 5-25, and in that the groove
structure (9, 10) consisting of one or more grooves has

a spiral pattern.
Fluid-flow machine according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the groove cross-section defined by the

groove width (s
+
) and groove height (h
+
) is in the order
of magnitude of µm
2
.
Fluid-flow machine according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that a groove structure (9, 10) consisting

of a plurality of grooves has grooves which run
parallel to one another or diverge slightly in the

direction of flow.
Fluid-flow machine according to Claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterized in that the groove structure (9, 10) is

made in the surfaces.
Fluid-flow machine according to one of Claims 1,
2 or 3, characterized in that the groove structure (9,

10) is a component of a surface coating.
Fluid-flow machine according to one of Claims 1
to 5, characterized in that the groove structure, in a

manner which fashions the surface, is made in a surface
with which liquid is in contact or in a formed-part 

surface which produces the surface with which liquid is
in contact.
Fluid-flow machine according to one of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the ratio of dimensionless

groove height (h
+
) to dimensionless groove spacing (s
+
) is
≤1.
