<ABSTRACT>
The annular support body (3) is at least partly enclosed and has a sloping part (4) facing the sealing lip (2). The sealing body (1) on the side of the sealing lip facing away from the space being sealed off has a dynamically stressed, axially spaced apart sealing ridge (6) with fits tightly against the surface being sealed with elastic pre-tension. The sealing ridge is axially positioned between two radial planes (8,9) by which the sloping part is axially defined.

A sealing ring, comprising a sealing body (1) with
a dynamically loaded sealing lip (2) made of

elastomeric material, which at least partially
encloses an annular supporting body (3), the

supporting body having a bevel (4) facing the
sealing lip and the sealing body having on the side

of the sealing lip facing away from the space (5)
to be sealed a dynamically loaded sealing bead (6),

which is alongside an axial distance away and comes
into contact with the face to be sealed in a

sealing manner under flexible prestress,

characterized in that
 the sealing bead (6) is
arranged in the axial direction between two radial

planes (8, 9), by which the bevel (4) of the
supporting body (3) is axially delimited.
A sealing ring according to claim 1, 
characterized
in that
 the ratio of the width (10) of the bevel
(4) and the width (11) of the supporting body (3)

is 0.2 to 0.7.
A sealing ring according to either of claims 1 and
2, 
characterized in that
 the bevel (4) is formed as
a chamfer (12). 
A sealing ring according to claim 3, 
characterized
in that
 the chamfer (12) has an angle α of from 20°
to 45° with respect to the axis (13).
A sealing ring according to either of claims 1 and
2, 
characterized in that
 the bevel (4) is formed as
an arc (14) convexly curved in the direction of the

sealing lip (2).
A sealing ring according to any one of claims 1 to
5, 
characterized in that
 all the edges of the
supporting body (3) which are surrounded by the

elastomeric material are of a rounded configuration
and 
in that
 the edges respectively have a radius of
at least 0.3 mm.
A sealing ring according to any one of claims 1 to
6, 
characterized in that
 the side (15) of the

supporting body (3) which is facing the face (7) to
be sealed encloses with the axis (13) an angle β of

from 5° to 20°, and the first front side (16), facing
away from the sealing lip (2), is brought closer to

the face (7) to be sealed than the second front
side (17), facing the sealing lip (2).
A sealing ring according to any one of claims 1 to
7, 
characterized in that
 the sealing body (1) is
trapezoidally widened in its cross section between

the radial planes (8, 9) in the direction of the
sealing lip (2).
A sealing ring according to any one of claims 1 to
8, 
characterized in that
, from the front side (19)
facing axially away from the sealing lip (2) up to

the sealing bead (6), the side (18) of the sealing
body (1) facing the face (7) to be sealed encloses

with the axis (13) an angle χ of from 5° to 15°, and

in that
 the face (7) to be sealed and the sealing
body (1) bound a wedge-shaped gap (20) which 

becomes smaller from the end face (19) in the
direction of the sealing bead (6).
A sealing ring according to any one of claims 1 to
9, 
characterized in that
 the sealing lip (2) and
the sealing bead (6) are respectively bounded by

two tapering faces (21, 22; 23, 24) intersecting
each other and 
in that
 the tapering faces (21, 23)
facing the space (5) to be sealed enclose with the

axis (13) a larger angle than the tapering faces
(22, 24) facing away from the space (5) to be

sealed.
