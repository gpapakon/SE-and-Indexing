<DESCRIPTION>
 DIAGNOSTIC METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR A CABLE TELEVISION INTERDICTION SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONTechnical FieldThe present invention generally relates to a cable television (CATV) interdiction system and, more particularly, to a CATV interdiction system including an improved method and apparatus for diagnosing various types of problems in a remote interdiction uni Description of the Prior ArtThe cable television industry has recently resorted to new technologies and has taken a second look at technologies developed in the early stages of development of cable television including negative and positive trap technology and interdiction systems to remove equipment off the subscriber's premises. A CATV interdiction system manufactured by Scientific- Atlanta, Inc. , and described by U.S. Patent No. 4,912,760, evidences one product manufacturer's response to such concerns. Precipitating the removal of equipment from the subscribers' premises has been the provision of television channel conversion equipment within the new television receivers sold today and the predominance of so-called cable ready receivers. In other words, the converter portions of converter/decoders are in many instances no longer required. Also, removal of equipment from the subscribers' premises accomplishes a removal of equipment from the hands of pirates. The interdiction system described by U.S. 4,912,760 promotes the removal of all CATV equipment from a CATV service subscriber's premise except for equipment for certain special service applications such as pay per view services. 

 Most embodiments promoted by manufacturers of interdiction systems conÂ¬ sist of a pole-mounted or side of building mounted enclosures located outside the subscriber's premises designed to serve four or more subscribers. This enclosure contains at least one microprocessor controlled oscillator and switch control electronics to secure several television channels. Control is accomplished by injecting an interfering or jamming signal into unauthorized channels from this enclosure.In the Scientific- Atlanta system to improve efficiency and to save costs, each of a plurality of oscillators may be used to jam several premium television channels in a continuous band of frequencies selected from the broadband 50-550 megahertz (MHz) or other spectrum. This technique not only reduces the amount of hardware required, but also maximizes the system flexibility. The oscillator output jamming signal frequency is periodically moved from channel to channel. Consequently,
