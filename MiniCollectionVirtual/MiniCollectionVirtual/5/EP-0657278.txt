<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for the manufacture of asymmetric laminated glazing formed by a support and at least one sheet of plastic by calendering. According to the invention, an original 15 made of plastic is brought into contact with the support (11) to be covered using an endless conveyor belt (16), the original being progressively released in order to be brought into contact with the support (11) just before reaching the pressing axis (3), as the laminated assembly passes through the pressing axis.

Process for the assembly of a plastics material blank (15) with a
support (11), particularly a rigid support, with a view to the formation of

a laminated glazing, in which the blank (15) is brought into contact with
the support (11) to be coated and the assembly is pressed by passage between

the rollers of a calender (1), characterized in that the blank is brought to
the pressing axis above the support to be covered by an endless conveyor

belt (16), which travels at the same speed as the support to be covered and
that its front end and then the entire blank is progressively freed from

the endless conveyor belt (16) in order to be brought into contact with the
support just in front of the pressing axis, as the assembly passes into the

pressing axis.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the release of the
blank takes place by the passage of the endless belt around a small radius,

convex curvature.
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that the convex curvature
radius is below 10 mm and preferably below 5 mm.
Process according to claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the release
of the blank takes place by the elimination of means (29) maintaining the

blank in contact with the endless belt.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that,
during its conveying on the endless belt, the blank is held by electrostatic

forces.
Process according to claim 5, characterized in that the blank is
released by the passage of the endless belt around a small radius, convex

curvature and in the vicinity of electrostatic discharge means.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 6, characterized in that
the blank has at least one polyurethane layer.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the blank has at
least one polyurethane layer with energy absorbing properties and a 

polyurethane layer having surface properties, said layer being in contact
with the endless belt, the opposite layer intended to come into contact with

the support having adhesive properties with the support, whereby said layer
can be the layer having energy absorbing properties or a supplementary

adhesive layer, more particularly of thermoplastic polyurethane.
Process according to one of the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
support is of glass.
Apparatus for the assembly of a plastics material blank (15) with a
support (11), particularly a rigid support, by calendering comprising a

calender (1) having upper pressing means (5) and lower pressing means (4)
forming between them a pressing axis, an upstream conveyor (9) for bringing

the support to be covered to the calender and a downstream conveyor (13)
for recovering the assembly on leaving 
the calender, said apparatus being
characterized in that it comprises an endless conveyor belt (16) for bringing

the blank onto the support to be covered upstream of the pressing axis,
during its engagement in the pressing axis, means maintaining the blank in

contact with the endless belt for its conveying up to the calender and means
(20) for releasing the blank just upstream of the pressing axis.
Apparatus according to claim 10, characterized in that it comprises
means (24) able to create electrostatic adhesive forces between the endless

belt and the blank which it has to convey.
Apparatus according to claim 11, characterized in that the means able
to create electrostatic adhesion forces incorporate a charging electrode

(24).
Apparatus according to one of the claims 11 or 12, characterized in that
the means for releasing the blank just upstream of the pressing axis have

a small radius, convex curvature about which passes the endless belt.
Apparatus according to claim 13, characterized in that the convex curvature
has a radius below 10 mm and preferably below 5 mm. 
Apparatus according to one of the claims 13 or 14, characterized in that
the convex curvature is brought about by the base of a metallic, V-shaped

guide part (21).
Apparatus according to claim 15, characterized in that the metallic
guide part (21) is electrically discharged by being connected to earth.
