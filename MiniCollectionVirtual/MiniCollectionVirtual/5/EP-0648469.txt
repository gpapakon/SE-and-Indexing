<ABSTRACT>
The system includes an ultrasound echograph (31) fitted with a TV monitor (32), a 3D probe (33) for analysing a subject, acquisition means (39), a memory card (board) (42) for storing the detected acoustic lines and a workstation (34) with a microprocessor (35) and a 3D echography memory (38). For reading the latter memory (38), the system includes a display device consisting of a dummy (mannequin) (56) simulating the subject, and a 3D orientation sensor (52) connected to the workstation via a 3D coordinate indicator (54) and visual display means (29) of the workstation which make the section plane which the sensor points towards the dummy correspond to the equivalent plane contained in the form of voxels in the echography memory (38) and display this plane on the screen of the TV monitor (32). Application to medical ultrasoound echography.

<CLAIMS>
A three-dimensional (3D) echography system, including:

a host ultrasonic echograph (31) equipped with a TV monitor(32),
an ultrasonic probe with 3D scanning (33) connected to the said echograph,
for analyzing a subject,
first electronic acquisition means (39) which include a control card (41) for
taking charge of the azimuth scanning of the probe and a memory card (42) storing the

acoustic lines originating from the echograph,
a workstation (34) consisting of a microprocessor assembly (35) equipped
with an echography memory (38) for storing 3D echographic data on the said subject,
the probe (33), the first electronic means (39) and the workstation (34)
being linked by a specific bus (43), which system is 
characterized in that
 it also includes:
for reading said echography memory (38), a device for visualizing the data
in said echography memory, consisting, on the one hand, of a dummy (56) which simulates

said subject, and, on the other hand, of a 3D orientation sensor (52) that can be manipulated
like a two-dimensional (2D) echographic probe simulator so as to indicate a sectional plane

of said dummy and is connected to the workstation (34), via a 3D coordinate indicator (54),
and second electronic display means (29) contained in said workstation
(34), which, in each position of said 3D orientation sensor (52), make the indicated

sectional plane correspond to an equivalent plane contained in the form of volumetric
image elements (voxels) in the echography memory (38), and which display this plane on a

screen (36) of said TV monitor (32).
A 3D echography system as claimed Claim 1, in which said ultrasonic probe
(33) with 3D scanning consists of 2D, sectorial, annular arrays and includes electronic and

mechanical means, respectively, for performing first and second crossed sectorial scans,
respectively, said probe being capable of emitting at a frequency lying between 3 and 8

MHz. 
A 3D echography system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, in which said host
echograph (31) is a 2D echograph which includes third electronic means (40) for supplying

3D acoustic lines after they have been digitized, and synchronization signals, and in which
said workstation (34) includes fourth electronic means (28) for converting said 3D data

previously acquired in spherical coordinates into a cartesian-coordinate scan.
A 3D echography system as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 it comprises a source emitter (53) arranged in the proximity of said
dummy (56), and that said 3D orientation sensor (52)includes three electromagnetic coils

which are capable of detecting the magnetic fields emitted by said source emitter, said
sensor (52) and said source emitter (53) being connected to said 3D coordinate indicator

(54).
A method of 3D echography, consisting in performing the acquisition of
echographic lines distributed in a volume and passing through the point of application of a

3D echographic probe (33) to a subject, in converting these lines into the form of digital
volumetric image elements (voxels), identified in spherical coordinates, and subsequently

in converting the coordinates of said voxels into cartesian coordinates, 
characterized in that

the visualization of said voxels in cartesian coordinates, in the form of sectional planes,
takes place by simulation of a 2D echography session or sessions, by conventional

manipulation of a 3D orientation sensor (52), which simulates a 2D echographic probe
against a dummy (56) which simulates said subject, a predetermined homothetic ratio being

established between the size of the subject and that of the dummy, and the addressing of
said voxels in the form of sectional planes through the volume represented by said voxels,

being proportional to the variations in displacement and in orientation of said sensor (52)
against said dummy (56).
A method of 3D echography as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 said
homothetic ratio is equal to 1.
The application of the 3D echography system as claimed in one of the
Claims 1 to 4 or of the 3D echography method as claimed in Claim 5 or 6 to the off-line 2D

echography analysis of a part of a human subject. 
The application of the 3D echography system as claimed in Claim 7 to the
learning of 2D echography analysis in real time.
