<ABSTRACT>
A blow moulding machine designed as a two station machine (10) has at least one extrusion device (12) and a storage head which supplies a tubular thermoplastic preform to two blow moulds arranged next to each other and having each two horizontally movable blow moulding dies. In order to simplify the construction of the machine, reduce the space required and achieve a high productivity, the disclosed bould moulding machine has only a three-platen system with three die platens (22, 24, 26) for clamping the four blow moulding dies (14, 16, 18, 20).

<CLAIMS>
A blow-moulding machine in the form of a two-station machine (10), with at least one 
extrusion device (12), optionally with a storage head and supplying a tube-like thermoplastic 

pre-moulded blank (68) of plastics material to two adjacent blow moulds comprising 
two horizontally displaceable blow-mould halves (14, 16; 18, 20), and with a 

machine frame (34) on which the two blow moulds or four blow-mould halves (14, 16; 
18, 20) are displaceably mounted, 
characterized in that
 the machine frame (34) is constructed 
in an open design without crossheads, and a pure three-plate system with three 

mould-clamping plates (22, 24, 26) is provided, in which the middle mould-clamping 
plate (24) supports a respective blow-mould half (16, 18), in order to clamp the four 

blow-mould halves (14, 16; 18, 20), wherein each of the three mould-clamping plates 
(22, 24, 26) is secured to a displaceably mounted support (28, 30, 32). 
A blow-moulding machine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the machine 
frame constructed in the form of a table frame (34) is arranged exclusively below the 

blow-mould halves (14, 16; 18, 20) or the mould-clamping plates (22, 24, 26) respectively, 
wherein lateral rails are provided on the table frame (34) in order to guide the individual 

supports (28, 30, 32) in a displaceable manner. 
A blow-moulding machine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 only a 
single travelling cylinder (52) is provided for the horizontal movement or rapid advance-closure 

movement of the two blow-mould halves (14, 16) and (18, 20) respectively, and, 
for the last locking movement of the respective blow-mould halves (14, 16; 18, 20) into 

their final locking position, separate locking units comprising a small closing cylinder 
(54) with an opposed locking pin (56) are arranged respectively on the mould-clamping 

plates (22, 24, 26). 
A blow-moulding machine according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the travelling 
cylinder (52) is operatively connected to the respective blow-mould halves (14, 16 or 18, 

20) by way of a coupling unit preferably constructed in the form of an hydraulically actuated 
centring cylinder (58) with a toothed pinion (50) engageable or displaceable into the 

toothed racks (46, 48) of the synchronizing device (44). 
A blow-moulding machine according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 under 
normal operating conditions one blow mould is always closed by way of a respective  

 
locking unit, while the other blow mould is opened or the blow-mould halves (14, 16; 18, 

20) thereof perform an opening or closing movement, wherein as a result of the coupling 
by way of the common middle mould-clamping plate (24) the first blow mould always 

jointly performs the displacement movement of the blow-mould half (16, 18; 18, 16) 
arranged on the other side of the middle mould-clamping plate (24). 
A blow-moulding machine according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, 
characterized in that
 the 
blow-mould halves (14, 16; 18, 20) are constructed so as to be movable beyond the 

normal "opening position" required for operation into a "maintenance position" opened 
still further. 
A blow-moulding machine according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 
the entire two-station machinie (10) together with the machine frame (34) is movable and 

is optionally provided with a special separate drive therefor.
