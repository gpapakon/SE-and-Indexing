<ABSTRACT>
Muramyl peptide compounds are useful in the treatment of toxicity, particularly when this condition results from alcohol, hypnotics or sedatives, anaesthetics, opioids or drug abuse generally. The muramyl peptide compound may be of either of general formulae (I) and (II). Preferred compounds include prototype MDP, muroctasin, MTP-PE, murabutide, t-MDP, N-acetyl-glucosaminyl-N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-isoglutamine (GMDP) and N-acetyl-glucosaminyl-N-acetyl-muramyl-L-alanyl-D-glutamic acid (GMDP-A).

<DESCRIPTION>
 USE OF MURAMYL PEPTIDE FOR THE TREATMENT OF TOXICITYThis invention relates to the treatment, prophylaxis and management of toxicity caused by a variety of toxic substances, including alcohol, anaesthetics and narcotics-Human and other animal bodies have developed a number of approaches to detoxifying toxic substances. The range of toxic substances likely to be encountered is extremely broad, particularly for humans but also for animals, and so it would be impracticable for the organism to have enzymes in store to deal specifically with all the new compounds already produced and yet to be produced by the organic chemist; such enzymes as are already available must serve as effectively as possible.In some ways any study of detoxification is hampered by the difficulty of deciding precisely what constitutes a toxic substance. Many compounds develop toxicity if the dose is sufficiently great and some species are quite resistant to substances which are extremely toxic in others. Also the time of exposure to the toxic substance is important, as is the route by which it enters- the body. However, in spite of this diversity both in the nature of the compounds likely to be encountered and in the different effects which can be exhibited by a single compound, there is in practice little difficulty in determining whether a compound is toxic and needs to be detoxified by the body. Possibly related to this, there is a remarkably small number of types of reaction which the human or animal body uses to deal with many toxic substances: the most commonly encountered are hydroxylation, oxidation, reduction and conjugation. Many of these reactions take place in the liver. 

A wide variety of compounds are detoxified by' hydroxylation, frequently mediated by the cytochrome P450 syste , which uses NADPH + ET as a reductant; molecular oxygen is also required and the substance is hydroxylated in the process. This system appears to interact with many different * chemical types of compounds, including aliphatic, aromatic and unsaturated compounds and those containing sulphur and nitrogen. Common drugs hydroxylated include: (a) barbiturates such as phenobarbitone (a sedative) ; (b) antipyririe (an analgesic and antipyretic) ; (c) amphetamine (a stimulant) ; (d) heroin (a narcotic) ; (e) meprobromate (a tranquilliser) ; and (f) acetanilide. Many toxic substances themselves stimulate the activity of hydroxylating systems in vivo * The consequence of hydroxylation is an easier elimination of unwanted foreign substances because of
