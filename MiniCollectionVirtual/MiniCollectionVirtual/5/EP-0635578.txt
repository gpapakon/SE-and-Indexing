<ABSTRACT>
Process for refining a raw sugar, especially brown sugar originating from the cane sugar industry, which is characterised in that it comprises the operations:   (a) of remelting the raw sugar in order to obtain a raw sugar syrup,   (b) of carbonation or of phosphatation of the said raw sugar syrup, and (c) of tangential microfiltration and/or of tangential ultrafiltration of the raw sugar syrup which has undergone carbonation or phosphatation.   This process is completed by the operations:   (d) of decolorisation of the sugar syrup resulting from the operation (c), and (e) of crystallisation and/or demineralisation of the sugar syrup resulting from the operation (d).

A process for refining a raw sugar, particularly raw sugar from the sugar cane
sugar industry, characterized in that it comprises the steps of:


(a) remelting of the raw sugar for obtaining a raw sugar syrup,
(b) carbonatation or phosphatation of said raw sugar syrup, and
(c) tangential microfiltration and/or tangential ultrafiltration of the raw sugar syrup,
which has been subjected to carbonatation or phosphatation.
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that it further comprises a
step of flocculation making use of a flocculating agent, said step being performed

simultaneously with step (b) or before or after said step (b).
The process according to claim 2, characterized in that the flocculating agent
is a quaternary ammonium compound of tallow fatty acids.
The process according to claim 2, characterized in that the flocculating agent
is a deacetylated chitosan poly-N-acetylglucosamine derived from chitin.
The process according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein step (b) is a
phosphatation, characterized in that the calcium oxide or lime milk, phosphoric acid and

flocculating agent are used in the phosphatation and flocculation steps in an amount of
200 to 900 ppm (expressed in CaO), 200 to 900 ppm (expressed in pure H
3
PO
4
) and 200
to 900 ppm (expressed in active product) in relation to the dry matter of the raw sugar

syrup, respectively.
The process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
carbonatation or phosphatation, flocculation and tangential microfiltration and/or

tangential ultrafiltration steps are implemented at a temperature of 70 to 95Â° C.
The process according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that
further comprises the steps of :


(d) decolorization of the sugar syrup resulting from step (c), and
(e) crystallization and/or demineralization of the sugar syrup resulting from step
(d).
