<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an improved igniter for 
use in airbag inflator assemblies. The airbag inflator assembly art employs the use of 
pyrotechnic materials for the release of gas at or very near the 
moment of impact of an automobile accident to timely inflate an 
airbag with gas. The filled airbag then protects the occupants of 
the car from substantial harm by providing a cushion to absorb the 
energy of the momentum transfer. Those skilled in this art appreciate that in order to achieve 
the timely filling of an airbag, the inflator assembly must be 
designed to convert electrical energy into chemical energy and do 
so very quickly. An important part of this assembly is the igniter 
or squib. The igniter is the interfacial mechanism that converts 
an electrical signal into heat which then activates a series of 
pyrotechnic materials which ultimately inflate the airbag, all in 
a matter of milliseconds. The igniter must be reliable and must 
integrate into the greater assembly unit, bearing in mind the ease 
of manufacture. A problem in this art is interfacing the igniter into the 
greater airbag assembly. In order for an igniter to be accepted by 
the automobile manufacturing industry for the purpose of airbag 
assembly, the igniter must be able to provide insulation resistance 
and protection against electrostatic discharges. A failure in 
either of these characteristics of the igniter results in a 
commercially failed igniter. A potential consequence of that 
failure, as well, could result in great harm to the occupants 
within the automobile.  Due to some of the electrical requirements companion to the 
use of pyrotechnics, an igniter must be designed with certain 
redundancies built in to insure against accidental misfiring. 
Should the design not protect against electrostatic discharge or 
provide certain insulation resistance, such misfires may occur. 
Grounding the electrical components and insuring that the 
pyrotechnics do not fire due to a build-up of electrostatic charges 
are, therefore, important. In prior devices, such as that described in U.S. patent 
3,971,320, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, the 
grounding was accomplished through a grounding shunt from a coaxial 
lead to the housing of the igniter. These prior art devices found 
it necessary to use the igniter housing as a grounding mechanism 
since it was convenient and operable. While facilitating the 
required grounding, the use of the housing as a grounding means 
required the use of an
