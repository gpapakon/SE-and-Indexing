<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid polymeric
electrolyte based on polyether, a procedure for its
preparation and its use in electrochemical devices.Solid polymeric electrolytes, also called ion
conducting polymers, are known in the art, composed of
a solution of an ion compound completely dissolved in
a solid plastic macromolecular material, the latter
being the polymerization product of monomers containing
at least one hetero-atom, especially oxygen.This macromolecular material is generally
polyethylenoxide (PEO), or other polyethers described
in US patent 4.471.037, French patents 2.523.769,
2.568.574, EP-13037 and EP-13199.The problems connected with these solid polymeric
electrolytes generally consist in the fact that they
only have a satisfactory ion conductivity at 
temperatures higher than room temperature, with a
limited mechanical resistance and dimensional stability
of the corresponding electrolytic membranes. All this
makes the solid polymeric electrolytes of the known art
of little interest for practical use.Solid polymeric electrolytes based on
polyvinylethers, characterized by a good mechanical
resistance and satisfactory ion conductivity at low
temperatures, have recently been described in US
patents 4.886.716 and US 5.173.205.The preparation of these electrolytes requires a
procedure with several steps which include the
dissolution of the solid polyvinylether in a suitable
solvent, preferably acetonitrile, containing an ion
compound and, possibly a chemical activator to induce
cross-linking, and finally the evaporation of the
solvent in order to obtain a membrane.It is now been found, according to the present
invention, that membranes with an excellent mechanical
resistance and improved ion conductivity compared to
the polymers of the known art can be obtained by
dissolving the polymer based on polyvinylether and the
ion compound in a high-boiling plasticizer. The cross-linking
reaction with a chemical agent capable of
reacting, at room temperature, with the Si-OEt groups 
present in the matrix by generating cross-linking points of the type Si-O-Si
enables the production of a membrane capable of encompassing
an active plasticizer.In accordance with this, the first aspect of the present invention
relates to a solid polymeric electrolyte, in the form of a membrane,
said polymeric electrolyte consists of a solution of an ionic compound
in a cross-linked polyether containing a liquid plasticizer, said
polymeric electrolyte is obtainable:
