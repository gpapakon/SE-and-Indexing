<CLAIMS>
Coating apparatus respectively with at least one 
roller and sheet material guide roller (1, 2) 

allocated thereto and metering roller (3, 4) allocated 
to at least one of these with a surface grooved 

essentially in peripheral direction or in the form of 
a thread in order to meter the coating mass in the gap 

(13, 14) existing between the roller and the sheet 
material guide roller (1, 2) on the one hand and the 

metering rollers (3, 4) on the other hand, 
characterised by a groove forming means or groove copy 

forming means (9, 9') which may be attached to the 
metering rollers (1, 2) during operation of the 

coating apparatus. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the groove forming means is a laser beam cutting 

device (9). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the groove forming means is a mechanical groove or 

thread bulging device (9'). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-3, 
characterised by a cleaning device (17, 19) for 

cleaning the surface of the metering roller (3, 4) 
before it reaches the groove forming means again after 

metering the coating mass in the metering gap. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-4, 
characterised in that two sheet material guide rollers 

(1, 2) form a pressing gap (12) between them which the 
sheet of material to be coated passes through in order  

 
to transfer the coating mass onto the sheet of 

material; and that the groove forming means (9, 9', 
10, 11) allocated to the two metering rollers (3, 4) 

are arranged exactly diametrically opposed to one 
another and are controlled synchronously in their 

longitudinal movement along the rollers. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1-5, 
characterised in that a position-controlled feed of 

the groove forming means (9, 9') along the metering 
rollers (3, 4) relative to the rotational axes or 

generated surfaces of the respectively allocated 
metering roller (3, 4) is provided.
