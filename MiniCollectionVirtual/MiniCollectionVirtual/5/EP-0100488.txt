<ABSTRACT>
A process for epoxidation of a fluoro-olefin is disclosed. 
The process comprises epoxidizing a fluoro-olefin repre­

sented by the general formula (I): 

 
wherein X¹, X² and X³ each represent a substituent selected 

from (a) -F, (b) a perfluoroalkyl group having 2 to 20 carbon 
atoms and (c) -CF₁Y¹, Y¹ may be the same or different and 

represents a substituent selected from (d) a halogen atom 
selected from F, Cl, Br and I, (e) -OZ¹ and (f) -Z¹, wherein Z¹ 

may be the same or different and represents a substituted or 
unsubstituted hydrocarbon group having not more than 20 

carbon atoms, and X¹, X², X³ and Y¹ may be combined with 
one another to form a cyclic compound, provided that all of 

X¹, X², X³ and Y¹ do not represent -F; using a hypochlorite 
dissolved or suspended in an aqueous phase as an oxidizing 

agent in the presence or absence of an inorganic base. The 
reaction is performed in a two phase system (aqueous and 

organic phases) in the presence of at least one phase transfer 
catalyst selected from (i) quaternary ammoniu
m salts, (ii) 
quaternary phosphonium salts, (iii) quaternary arsonium 

salts, (iv) sulfonium salts and (v) lipophilic complexing 
agents for cations contained in the hypochlorite.
