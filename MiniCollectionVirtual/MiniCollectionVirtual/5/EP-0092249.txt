   NON-A,      NON-B    HEPATITIS-ASSOCIATED MONOCLONAL
 ANTIBODY AND DIAGNOSTIC REAGENT
 This invention relates to a non-A, non-B hepatitisassociated monoclonal antibody, and a culture   composi-    tion and a diagnostic reagent containing the same.


 The existence of viral hepatitis of types A and B is known and an antigen-antibody system associated  with these types of hepatitis has also been clarified.


Immunoserological diagnosis using such systems has become possible and development and introduction of vaccines have been accomplished.


 In the course of research, however, the existence of viral hepatitis which belongs neither to type A hepatitis nor to type B hepatitis, has become known and the frequency of occurrence thereof has been higher than expected. Type non-A, non-B hepatitis accounts for more than 80% up to 90% of posttransfusion hepatitis and it has been reported that type non-A, non-B hepatitis also accounts for about   5046    of sporadic acute hepatitis. It has been established that even among normal blood donors, a considerable number of donors carry the non-A, non-B hepatitis virus. The following literature references set forth the state of the art pertaining to non-A, non-B hepatitis: 1) Prince; A.M. et al.: Long-incubation post-transfusion
 hepatitis without serological evidence of exposure

 The term "non-A, non-B hepatitis" used herein refers to those kinds of hepatitis which are believed to occur because of infection with virus(es) other than the previously known viruses, such as, type A hepatitis virus, type B hepatitis virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein
Barr virus and the like, which non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses   ParticiPate in    the disease as   pathogens,    and which do not exhibit a significant rise for HAV antibody,
