<ABSTRACT>
A device for use in the light-beam 
processing of materials comprises a point 

optical light source (1) and a 
concentrating reflector (2) with a 

reflecting surface in the form of a surface 
of rotation. The generatrix of the surface 

of rotation of the concentrating reflector 
(2) is formed by the arcs of co-focal 

ellipses (3), segments of beams (4) 
originating from the focus which 

coincides with the light source (1) and 
ellipses connecting the ends of the said 

arcs and the arc of cicumferences (5) with 
their centre at that focus. The dimensions 

of the boundary segments and their 
configuration are determined taking into 

account the requirement to gather the 
maximum amount of light from the point 

source (1) in the region of the focal point 
on the surface of the material undergoing 

treatment while retaining the greatest 
possible freedom to change the reflector's 

shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to illumination engineering, 
particularly to technical means for concentration of 
optical radiation and can prove useful in solving the problems 
of heat treatment of materials including development of means 
for soldering and welding of sheet materials. It is practicable 
to use the disclosed device for body repairs of motor vehicles, 
welding and soldering difficult conditions, applying some 
kinds of coatings to the surface of sheet materials, in 
roofing work, etc. Known in the prior art is a beam machining device comprising 
a reflector and an extended source of radiation arranged 
along the optical axis of said reflector wherein the reflecting 
surface has a profile described by the equation: 
   where
 
   x,y - coordinates of reflector profile,
 
   2L - length of radiation source,
 
   h - distance from center of source to center of irradiation 
zone (USSR Inventor's Certificate No.1227908 IPC-5: 
F-21V 7/04 of 19.12.83). A disadvantage of said device lies 
in a relatively low illumination intensity of the irradiation 
zone which is caused by the absence in this geometry of the 
reflector of at least one direction of radiation of a linear 
source for which radiation would be collected into a focal 
point. Another known beam machining device comprises an extended 
source of radiation and a concentrating reflector made up 
of several segments, the surface shape of at least two of them 
being characterized by the expressions: 
for y > 0, and 
for y < 0 where x,y - coordinates of the profile of reflector 
surface, L - length of the radiating segment of the source, 
h - distance from the center of the source to the irradiation 
zone, and m is the radiation angle of the source corresponding 
to maximum brightness. The other elements of the reflector 
surface are constituted by conjugated elements of ellipsoids 
of revolution (USSR Inventor's Certificate 
No.1081605 IPC-5:G21B 5/10 of 21.12.82). Another disadvantage 
of this technical solution lies in a low illuminating intensity 
of the machining zone ensuing from the fact that, on the 
one hand, the number of radiation directions along which the 
radiation of the linear source is collected in one point is 
limited by the number of maximums of the radiation indicator 
and, on the other hand, there is no indication of the inter-relation 
between the size of the radiation source, its position 
in the radiating region and the surface profile of the 
concentrating reflector. Besides, the optical characteristics 
of the
