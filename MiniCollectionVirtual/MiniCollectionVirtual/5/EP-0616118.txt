<ABSTRACT>
A ducted fan gas turbine engine (10) is provided 
with a plurality of sensors (23) which detect the 

presence of liquid water in air exhausted from the high 
pressure compressor (14) of the engine into its 

combustion system (15). In the event that liquid water 
is detected, the fuel flow to the combustion system (15) 

is increased to cause the high pressure compressor (14) 
to rotate faster and thereby vaporize the liquid water. 

Such liquid water can be present in the air exhausted 
from the high pressure compressor (14) when the engine 

(10) is operating in very heavy rain and can adversely 
affect normal engine operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of operating a 
gas turbine engine during the ingestion of water by that 
engine and to a gas turbine engine which is capable of 
being so operated. Aircraft mounted gas turbine engines are usually 
capable of operating satisfactorily in rain, hail or 
snow. Water ingested by the engines under these 
conditions is usually vaporized during its passage 
through the engine's compressors. Consequently air which 
eventually enters the engine's combustion system is 
generally free of significant quantities of liquid water. There are, however, circumstances in which ingested 
water can prejudice the effective operation of the 
engines. The most common of these circumstances is when 
the engines are passing through very heavy rain, hail or 
snow at minimum idle, that is at their lowest flight 
power setting. This typically occurs during the descent 
of the aircraft powered by the engines prior to its 
landing. Under these circumstances, it is well known 
that the ingested water can have up to three adverse 
effects upon engine operation: 
(a) The engine can progressively run down until it 
eventually stops. This is a characteristic of older 
design engines having hydromechanical fuel flow control 
mechanisms although not of more modern engines having 
electronic control mechanisms. (b) The engine can suffer from a flameout. Thus 
the presence of liquid water within the engine combustor 
together with the low combustion pressures and 
temperatures associated with minimum idle conditions 
result in combustion being extinguished. (c) The high pressure compressor of the engine can 
surge and thereby cease operating. This arises as a 
result of the working line of the compressor being raised 
by water evaporation and the extra work done by the 
compressor on the water. EP-A-0533567 describes a system for controlling a 
gas turbine engine which relies on the fact that the 
temperature difference between the inlet and outlet of 
its high pressure compressor is affected by the ingestion 
of water by the compressor. The temperature difference 
is monitored and related to engine speed to provide an 
output signal which is used to control the fuel flow to 
the engine. Essentially if the ingested water slows the 
engine down sufficiently, the fuel flow to the engine is 
increased to ensure its continued operation. There are drawbacks with such a system however. 
Firstly it is complicated in that it relies on the use of 
several detectors in various parts of the engine and is 
therefore

A method of operating a gas turbine engine (10) which

system (15), during the ingestion of water-laden air by
