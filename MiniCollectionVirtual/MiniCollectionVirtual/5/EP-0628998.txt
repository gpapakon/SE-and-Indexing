<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor device and a method for 
manufacturing the same according to the present 

invention, for example, an insulating film (12) is 
deposited on a silicon substrate (11), and a concave 

groove (13) is formed in the insulating film (12) in 
accordance with a predetermined wiring pattern. 

Titanium and palladium are deposited in sequence on the 
insulating film (12) to form a titanium film (14) and a 

palladium film (15), respectively. A silver film (16) 
is formed on the palladium film (15) by electroplating, 

and a groove-shaped silver wiring layer (17) is formed 
by polishing. The resultant structure is annealed at a 

temperature of about 700Â°C, and an intermetallic compound 
(18) is formed by alloying the titanium film (14) 

and palladium film (15) with each other. Consequently, 
a burying type wiring layer (19) whose resistance is 

lower than that of aluminum, is constituted by the 
silver wiring layer (17) and intermetallic compound 

(18).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
device and a method for manufacturing the same.FIGS. 1A to 1D show an example of a conventional
process of manufacturing a wiring structure of a semiconductor
device.First an insulating film 2 is thermally oxidized
and formed on a semiconductor substrate 1, and then an
aluminum (Al) or an alloy 3 containing aluminum (Al) as
the principal ingredient is formed on the insulating
film 2 by sputtering (FIG. 1A).The alloy 3 thus formed is patterned to have a predetermined
shape through a well-known lithography
process, thereby forming a first wiring layer 4
(FIG. 1B).An interlayer insulating film 5 is deposited on the
resultant structure, and then a via hole 6 is formed in
the film 5 (FIG. 1C).After that, a second wiring layer 7 formed of
aluminum or an alloy containing aluminum as the principal
ingredient, is formed on the interlayer insulating
film 5, and connected to the first wiring layer 4
through the via hole 6 (FIG. 1D). Thus, a multilayer
wiring layer of the first wiring layer 4 and second
wiring layer 7 is formed.However, the width of a wiring layer has recently
become narrower in accordance with the progress of high 
degree of integration of semiconductor devices. For
this reason, a conventional wiring layer containing
aluminum nearly reaches its limitation in reliability of
EM (electromigration) or the like.Since high-speed operations of semiconductor
devices cause a noticeable delay in signal transmission
due to wiring resistance, it is desirable to decrease
the wiring resistance further.According to the conventional technique of assembling
an LSI (Large Scale Integrated Circuit), a layer
of Ag (silver) or Cu (copper) whose resistance is lower
than that of aluminum can be formed. However, neither
silver nor copper has been used for forming a wiring
layer since they are difficult for etching.It is accordingly an object of the present invention
to provide a semiconductor device having a highly
reliable wiring structure and a method for manufacturing
the same.Accordingly, the present invention provides a
semiconductor device
according to claim 1.The present invention also provides a method for
manufacturing a semiconductor device according to claim 3. This invention can be more fully understood from
the following detailed description when taken in conjunction
with the accompanying drawings, in which:
FIGS. 1A to 1D are cross-sectional views showing a
conventional process of forming a wiring layer;FIGS. 2A to 2D are cross-sectional views schematically
