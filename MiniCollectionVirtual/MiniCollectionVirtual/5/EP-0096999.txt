 METHOD FOR THE CONTROL OF INSECTS
 WHICH ATTACK PLANTS WITH PHOSPHORUS
 DERIVATIVES OF CARBAMIMIDOTHIOIC
 ACID ESTERS
 Various phosphorus derivatives of carbamimidothioic acid esters having pesticidal activity are known, such as those taught in Czechoslovakian Patent No. 172,676.


 The present invention is directed to a method for the kill and control of sucking and boring-type insects which attack rice, fruit and nut trees, cotton, corn and vegetable plants employing compositions containing, as the active insecticide, at least one compound of the formula
EMI1.1     
 wherein
 R and R1 are each independently a methyl or ethyl
 group or
 R and R1 when taken together represent an alkylene
 group containing 4 to 6 carbon atoms or a group of
 the formula  
EMI2.1     
 wherein
 A is oxygen, sulfur or -NR;
 R2 and R3 are each independently an alkyl group
 containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms and
 X and Y represent oxygen or sulfur with the
 proviso that X and Y are not the same
 By the term "alkyl" as used herein is meant alkyl groups which are either straight chained,-branched chained or cyclic.
Such groups are for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tertiary butyl, cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl.


 The preferred compounds of the present invention are those wherein Rê is methyl or ethyl. More preferred compounds are those wherein Rê is methyl or ethyl and R and R1 are independently either methyl or ethyl. Even more preferred compounds are those wherein Rê is methyl or ethyl, R and RÚ are independently either methyl or ethyl and R3 is methyl.


 The active compounds employed in the method of the present invention are either oils or crystalline solids and are soluble in many common organic solvents.


 In addition, the active compounds employed in the present invention are highly effective as plant systemic insecticides for the kill and control of such insects.  


 The compounds employed in the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods as follows:
 Method A:
 Substantially equimolar amounts of an appropriate substituted carbamimidothioic acid ester of the formulae
EMI3.1     
 and an appropriate phosphorochloridothioic acid ester of the formulae
EMI3.2     
 are reacted together in the presence of a solvent and a
HC1 acceptor.


 In carrying out the reaction, the substituted carbamimidothioic acid ester and the phosphorus chloride reactants, the solvent and the HC1 acceptor are mixed together in any convenient manner. The mixture is then stirred at a temperature between

CLAIMS:



 1. A method for the kill and control of insects which attack plants which comprises contacting the insects or their habitat with a composition which comprises an inert carrier in intimate admixture with an insecticidally effective amount of at least one active compound of the formula
