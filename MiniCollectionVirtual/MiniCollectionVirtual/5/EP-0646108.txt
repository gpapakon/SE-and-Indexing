<ABSTRACT>
A hydroxypropylated 2-nitro-p-phenylenediamine of formula (I), wherein R1 is a C1-4 alkyl, (beta)-hydroxyethyl, (beta)-hydroxypropyl or (gamma)-hydroxypropyl radical; R2 and R3 independently represent a (beta)-hydroxyethyl, (beta)-hydroxypropyl, (gamma)-hydroxypropyl or 

g(b,g)-dihydroxypropyl radical, with the proviso that at least one of R1, R2 and R3 is a (gamma)-hydroxypropyl radical, while the other two are not both a (beta)-hydroxyethyl radical; and cosmetically acceptable salts thereof. This compound may be used for directly dyeing hair to give blue through purplish blue shades which are wash-fast, light-fast, weatherproof and sweat resistant.
