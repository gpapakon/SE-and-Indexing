<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved arterial catheter and
particularly to an arterial catheter having an introducer needle and coaxially
mounted guide wire permanently affixed thereto.It is generally well known to utilize a small hollow needle to assist
in introducing a catheter into the lumen of a blood vessel. As known in the prior
art the needle is typically positioned coaxially within the catheter or cannula with
its distal end projecting beyond the distal end of the catheter. To assist in
feeding the catheter into the blood vessel, a guide wire is typically fed through
the hollow needle and into the blood vessel after the needle has been properly
positioned within the vessel. Numerous prior art devices have been proposed to
facilitate the percutaneous catheterization of a blood vessel. See, for example,
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,961,729; 4,650,472; 4,772,264, 4,655,750 and 4.844.092.Unfortunately, many of the prior art devices do not provide a
means for containing the guide wire as an integral part of the unit. These
devices require that the practitioner insert the wire through the needle after it has
been inserted into the blood vessel. The device shown and described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,655,750, however, discloses an integral guide wire positioned
through the center plug of the introducer needle wire which is contained in a
sterile bag covering the proximal end of the guide wire. U.S. Patent No. 
4 417 886 discloses a catheter mounted over an introducer needle in which the
guide wire is positioned within a proximally mounted tube having a slot for
guiding a wire pushing mechanism for insertion through the needle into the
blood vessel. Further in US Patent No. 4 844 092 a catheter is disclosed wherein
a guide wire is attached to the catheter. However, upon separation of the
needle and the guide wire from the catheter, the guide wire has to be detached
separately.While attempts have been made to facilitate the use of a wire guide in catheter
introducer needles, these devices are both complex an drelatively expensive.
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an arterial catheter
system which provides a low cost, relatively simple and easy to use
catheter system having an integral guide wire. It is further an object of the
invention to overcome the limitations of prior art catheter systems in a cost
effective manner. It is also an object
according to a preferred embodiment
of the invention to provide a catheter
having a distal means to inhibit the penetration of the catheter
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A catheter system for percutaneous insertion and placement of a catheter
in the lumen of a vessel comprising


a small diameter hollow introducer needle (10) having a sharp end point
at its distal end (11) and a hub (12) at its proximal end comprising an

opening (14), a flexible catheter (20) coaxially mounted over said
introducer needle (10) having a receiving fitting (21) at its proximal end

for receiving the needle hub (12) for communication with said hollow
needle, and a guide wire (15) coaxially positioned within said introducer

needle with its distal end positioned adjacent said needle point, said guide
wire exiting the needle through said opening (14) in said hub, 
characterized

in that the proximal end (17) of the guide wire (15) is attached to the
exterior of the needle hub (12) and the guide wire (15) is forming a loop

(18) between said opening and said proximal end, wherein the length of
wire forming said loop (18) is associated with the length of the catheter

necessary to guide said catheter in the lumen.
A catheter as set forth in claim 1 wherein said catheter
includes an annular groove (23) at its distal end (11).
A catheter as set forth in Claim 1 wherein said guide wire
loop (18) is covered with a protective covering (19).
A catheter system as set forth in Claim 1 or 2 wherein said
opening (14) in the needle hub (12) is through the side wall thereof.
A catheter system as set forth in Claim 1 or 2 wherein said
introducer needle hub (12) is a luer type fitting.
