<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is a process for drying and firing green bricks in one operation, in which the green bricks, after pressing, are put directly onto a hearth car and then transported through a combined drying and firing oven (kiln). In order also to be able to dry and fire economically, and in one pass, large-sized green bricks produced by the soft-pressing process, the green bricks (1) are stacked on the hearth car in a plurality of layers (1a, 1b, 1c) and the individual layers are spaced apart from one another by interposed perforated insertion elements (2). Uniform airing of the mutually facing bearing surfaces is thus guaranteed. The insertion elements are preferably designed in the form of rods with a perforation.

<CLAIMS>
Insertion element for use in drying and firing large semi-finished bricks,
produced in a soft pressing process, in a procedure in which the semi-finished

bricks have a relatively high proportion of holes of 20 to 50% and are
transferred damp, after the pressing process, on a furnace truck through a

combined drying and firing furnace without transloading, which element is
constructed as a bar (2) with a rectangular, particularly square, cross-section

and a length which is less than the breadth of the contact surface of the semi-finished
bricks (1), characterised in that the bars of rectangular or square cross-section

have openings, which are constituted by perforations which are arranged
transversely or obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the bars, and the bars are

manufactured from refractory material.
Insertion element as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the
insertion element comprises two bars intersecting in an X shape.
Insertion element as claimed in one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the perforation comprises openings of square cross-section.
Insertion element as claimed in one of Claims 1 or 2, characterised in
that the perforation comprises openings of round cross-section.
Method of drying and firing large semi-finished bricks, produced in a
soft pressing process, in a procedure in which the semi-finished bricks have a

relatively high proportion of holes of 20 to 50% and are transported damp, after 
the pressing process, on a furnace truck through a combined drying and firing

furnace without transloading, the semi-finished bricks (1) being arranged above
one another in a plurality of layers (1a, 1b, 1c) on the furnace truck and the

individual layers are spaced from one another by a plurality of rod-shaped
insertion elements (2) as claimed in one of the preceding Claims 1 to 4, and the

insertion elements (2) being so constructed and arranged parallel to one another
that they make a flow of the drying air and of the furnace air possible between

the layers of the semi-finished bricks along the contact surfaces of the insertion
elements substantially in the direction of the holes in the semi-finished bricks

(1).
Method as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the bar-shaped
insertion elements (2) are arranged parallel to the direction of the holes in the

semi-finished bricks.
Method as claimed in Claim 5, characterised in that the bar-shaped
insertion elements (2) are arranged transversely to the direction of the holes in

the semi-finished bricks (1) and are so constructed that drying air and furnace
air can flow through them.
