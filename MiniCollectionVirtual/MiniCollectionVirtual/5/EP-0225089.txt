<ABSTRACT>
Water displacer rods for use in water reactors 
and for their supports in the reactor are provided with 

wear resistant coatings applied by electrospark deposition 
and bonded to the zirconium base alloy forming the outer 

portion of the rod by electrospark-deposition (ESD) 
technique.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to ESD 
(electrospark deposited) coated zirconium base alloy 
structural elements for use in water reactors. It especially 
relates to water displacer rods having an ESD 
coating to minimize wear. In pressurized water reactor internals designs 
Zircaloy components come into contact with AISI 304 stainless 
steel and other non-zirconium base alloy components in 
an environment of flowing high temperature, high pressure 
water. Under these conditions, vibrations may be produced 
in these contacting components causing repeated impacts and 
fretting wear to occur in the Zircaloy component, thereby 
reducing the in reactor lifetime of the Zircaloy component 
or causing complex and costly structural design changes to 
reduce the wear rate (if feasible). Water displacer rodlets are low neutron cross 
section rods having a tubular Zircaloy cladding containing 
ZrOâ‚‚ pellets and helium. These rods may be movably held 
above a fuel assembly in a water reactor and are lowered 
into guide thimbles within the fuel assemblies as needed 
during reactor operation to displace water (coolant). Typically 16 to 24 water displacer rods are held 
suspended above a fuel assembly by a spider vane. There 
may be 88 such vanes in a reactor. The tubular Zircaloy cladding is hermetically 
sealed at both ends and may typically have an outer  
 
diameter of about 2.32 cm and a length in excess of about 
2.9 m. It is now readily apparent that because of the 
slender structure of the water displacement rods, support 
is required along their length to minimize vibration due 
to the flowing coolant while also keeping them aligned 
with their respective thimble tubes in the fuel assembly. Examples of water displacer rods, spider veins 
and their use are provided in Trevor A. Francis' U.S. 
Patent Application Serial No. 595,154 filed January 13, 
1984, corresponding to EP.A 0158812, and Robert K. Gertsen et al. 
U.S.-A-4725401 corresponding to EP.A 0149181 (both assignee 
to the assignee herein, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation). 
These patent applications are hereby incorporated 
by reference. One area where wear rates have been found to be 
particularly significant is where water displacer rods 
come into contact with AISI 304 stainless (304SS) steel 
guide supports. It was observed, in fretting wear tests, 
that while the primary purpose of the 304SS guide supports 
is to support and protect the rods from excessive wear, 
the Zircaloy tubular member forming the rod is susceptible 
to wear due to the
