<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a thiohydantoin of formula (II) from an N-protected amino acid (I) is described. The method employs a uronium (III) or phosphonium (IV) compound to activate the terminal carboxyl group of the amino acid and a thiocyanate reagent to cyclize the activated amino acid to the thiohydantoin. The thiohydantoin can be cleaved from its N-protecting group, for use in C-terminal peptide sequencing. Particularly preferred uronium compounds include salts of 2-chlorouronium. Preferred thiocyanate reagents include trimethylsilyl isothiocyanate and crown ether adducts of metallothiocyanates, such as the 18-crown-6 adduct of KSCN.

TH formation is useful, for example, in C-terminal amino acid sequencing, where a C-terminal amino acid of a peptide is sequentially (a) converted to its corresponding TH, (b) cleaved from the remaining peptide, and (c) identified as to amino acid, e.g., by HPLC. Another use of such reaction methods is in preparing amino acid TH compounds for use as standards, e.g., in C-terminal sequencing.The conversion of protected amino acids to corresponding amino acid TH's was first proposed in 1911 by T.B. Johnson et al. (J. Am. Che . Soc. , 48:103 (1911), and in 1926 by Schlack and Kumpf fHθPPe-Seyler,s Z Phvs Chem. 154:125 (1926)]. A number of improvements to this early method have since been proposed (see, e.g.. Stark; Boyd et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,051,368; Hawke, 1987; Hawke, U.S. Patent No. 4,837,165; Hawke et al. , U.S. Patent No. 5,049,507; Inglis; Miller, 1988; and Miller,
