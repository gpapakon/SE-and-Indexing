 PLANT DEFENSE GENE REGULATORY ELEMENTS
 FIELD OF THE INVENTION
 The present invention relates generally to plant defense mechanisms. More particularly, the invention relates to regulatory elements that control selective induction of plant defense genes. In addition, the invention relates to a novel method for identifying compounds that may be useful for inducing transcription of stress-regulated plant defense genes.


 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
 Plants exhibit a number of adaptive and protective responses to environmental stresses. Of particular significance in this respect is the plant's ability to convert the amino acid phenylalanine into a number of protective phenylpropanoid products, including isoflavonoid and coumarin phytoalexin antibiotics, flavonoid pigments, and the cell wall polymer lignin (Hahlbrock and Grisebach (1979), Dixon, et al., (1983)).


 The synthesis of these products by specific branch pathways which diverge from the central phenylpropanoid pathway is selectively modulated during development and by environmental stimuli. For example, u.v. and white light stimulate the production of protective u.v.-absorbing flavonoids (Hahlbrock, et al., (1976)) whereas infection induces phytoalexin synthesis (Whitehead, et al., (1982)).


 Recent plant molecular biological studies have shown that disease resistance is an active process, dependent on plant host RNA and protein synthesis. Such studies have also shown that an actual pathogen attack or an "attack" by glycan elicitor preparations, obtained from fungal cell walls, causes massive changes in the pattern of plant host RNA synthesis, including transcriptional activation of plant defense genes en  coding the lytic enzymes chitinase and glucanase, cell wall hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins, and enzymes involved in the synthesis of lignin and phytoalexins (Cramer, et al., (1985a); Lamb, et al., (1987); Lawton and Lamb (1987)). Accumulation of defense gene transcripts leads to marked stimulation of the synthesis of the encoded proteins and expression of the corresponding defense responses.


 Analysis of the molecular events underlying a plant's defense mechanisms will make it possible for plant biologists to design rational strategies for biotechnological enhancement of plant's own defense systems   c    For example, it is now possible to envision genetically engineered plants in which the defense genes can be pre-activated in response to developmental or environmental signals. While pre-activation of these genes would place an
