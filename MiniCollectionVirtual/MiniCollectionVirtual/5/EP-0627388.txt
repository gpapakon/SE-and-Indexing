<ABSTRACT>
Process for the vitrification of solid residues, a device for making use of this process and the product resulting from this process. According to this vitrification process the residues are heated to a temperature not much higher than their melting temperature and, once molten, the products are rapidly removed in order to keep them in the viscous state to trap substances capable of contaminating the environment. This process and this device find application in all fields in which it is desirable to maintain a temperature not much higher than the desired treatment temperature and in particular they find application for the treatment of solid residues produced by the incineration of household and/or industrial waste.

Process for vitrifying solid waste coming from incineration of house
and/or industrial waste of the type consisting in melting the waste then

cooling them rapidly for forming a vitrous mass, characterized in that,
before the rapid cooling, the following steps are made :


maintaining a molten bath (9) at a temperature (T
1
) higher by 50 - 200°C
to the temperature (T
2
) provided for melting said waste to be vitrified,
distributing the waste (11) on the surface of the molten bath (9), which
waste upon contacting the molten bath forms an intermediary viscous layer

of molten waste (10),
evacuating only the intermediary viscous layer of molten waste (10) by
means of a discharge system (7) placed in the molten bath (9),

with, as a condition, that the contacting time between the molten bath (9)
and the molten waste layer (10) does not exceed 15 min.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the temperature (T
2
) is
higher by a maximum of 50°C to the melting temperature T of the waste

(11).
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the molten bath
(9) has the same composition as the solid waste (11) to be molten.
Process according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that

the waste (11) is mixed with an additive in order to form a mixture (M) that
is poured on the molten bath (9).
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that about 45% by weight
of the dry mass of the mixture (M) is formed by a mixture (M
2
) having a 
composition that is comprised in the zone (1) of the ternary phase SiO
2
-Al
2
O
3
-CaO
diagram, limited by the 1400°C isotherm of the liquid sheets of

this diagram.
Process according to claim 4 or 5, characterized in that the dry mass of
the additive is formed by at least 60% by weight of a mixture (M
1
) of SiO
2
,
Al
2
O
3
, CaO.
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that the mixture (M
1
)
comprises between about 55% and about 75% by weight of SiO
2
, between
about 5% and about 30% by weight of Al
2
O
3
 and between about 5% and
about 35% by weight of CaO.
Process according to one of claims 4 to 7, characterized in that the
additive is chosen among slag, pozzolana, basalt.
