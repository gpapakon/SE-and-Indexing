<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to a tubular element for the 
formation of bags for the vacuum-packing of products, consisting of an inner 

layer or film (14) having thread-like elements (15), which extend along the 
length of the tubular element and are intended to be relief on at least on inner 

surface of the resulting bag and to define among themselves channels (16) for 
the evacuation, by suction, of air from the bag at the time of using the bag for 

the vacuum-packing of a product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to packing materials, and more
specifically, to an element for the formation of bags that are impermeable,
heat-sealable and intended for the vacuum-packing of perishable products.Packing materials in the shape of tubular elements, which are sealed in
the longitudinal direction by means of bonding and are capable of being
shaped into bags for the above-mentioned use, have already been proposed.
According to a known embodiment, the wall of the tubular element consists
of at least two overlapping elements which are made of different materials, 
specifically an outer layer or film made of a material that is impermeable to
gases and an inner layer or film made of a thermoplastic, heat-sealable
material. The two layers are intimately overlapped, and at least the inner
layer has an embossing or a network of channels, which promote the outlet of
air at the time the bag is used for vacuum-packing. Therefore, the network
of channels is obtained on the inner, heat-sealable layer of the element. One bag of this type has been disclosed, for
example, in EP-A-0 216 327 (which corresponds to
US-A-4 576 422). However, in these documents bags are
described having interconnecting air channels separated by protrusions
or "islands", obtained by embossing, i.e. by
deformation of the inner layer of the receptacle
or by means
of variations in the thickness of a layer of material.
A production process of this type of sheets is complex, relatively
unprofitable and difficult to use in industry.The present product can be obtained by direct or indirect
extrusion methods simplifying its production. On the other hand, the purpose of the present invention is to
provide a packing material with walls which are formed by two or more layers
or films made of different plastic materials, and in which, with the
impermeability and heat-sealability remaining constant, the channels for the
discharge of air are defined by thread-like elements which are applied on at
least one inner surface of the manufactured article. Thus, the embossing is
eliminated, causing the bags for the vacuum-packing to be more simply and
economically produced and to have reliable use.Therefore, the present invention is focused on a tubular element for
the formation of bags for the vacuum-packing of products in accordance with
claim 1. Details of the present invention will become
more evident from the description below with reference to the attached
drawings, in which:

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Tubular element (10) for the formation of bags for
the vacuum-packing of products, said element being

formed by at least one starting sheet (12, 12'), which
consists of at least one outer layer or film (13),

made of a plastic material that is impermeable to
gases, and of an inner layer or film (14) made of a

thermoplastic, heat-sealable material, said two outer
and inner layers being intimately connected, the inner

surface of at least one of said inner layers (14) comprising
evacuation channels (16), characterized in that

parallel thermoplastic, heat-sealable thread-like elements
(15) are applied along a length of said tubular element

defining bulges extending away from said
inner surface (14), and being spaced apart to define said

channels. 
Tubular element in accordance with claim 1, in which said thread-like
elements (15) are inserted on said inner layer or film (14) and are

arranged so as to fill up at least one inner surface of the resulting bag and to
extend along the depth of said bag.
Tubular element in accordance with claims 1 and 2, in which the
outer layer of film (13) of the starting sheet or sheets (12, 12') is made of

nylon or polyester, in which the inner layer or film (14) of said starting sheet 
(12, 12') is made of polyethylene or polythene, and in which said thread-like

elements (15), which define the channels (16), are made of the same material
as said inner layer or film (14).
