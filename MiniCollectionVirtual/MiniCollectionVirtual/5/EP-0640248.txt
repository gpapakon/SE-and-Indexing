<ABSTRACT>
An ohmic contact to a p-type zinc selenide (ZnSe) layer (17) in a Group II-VI semiconductor device, includes a zinc mercury selenide (ZnxHg1-xSe) or zinc telluride selenide (ZnTexSe1-x) layer (19) on the zinc selenide layer, a mercury selenide (HgSe) layer (18) on the zinc mercury selenide or zinc telluride selenide layer and a conductor (such as metal) layer on the mercury selenide layer. The zinc mercury selenide or zinc telluride selenide and mercury selenide layers between the p-type zinc selenide and the conductor layer (13) provide an ohmic contact by eliminating the band offset between the wide bandgap zinc selenide and the conductor. Step graded, linear graded, and parabolic graded layers of zinc mercury selenide or zinc telluride selenide may be provided. The ohmic contact of the present invention produces nearly ideal voltage-current relation, so that high efficiency Group II-VI optoelectronic devices may be obtained. The integrated heterostructure is formed by epitaxially depositing the ohmic contact on the Group II-VI device. A removable overcoat layer may be formed on the Group II-VI device to allow room temperature atmospheric pressure transfer of the device from a zinc based deposition chamber to a mercury based deposition chamber, for deposition of the ohmic contact. The integrated heterostructure may also be formed by forming an optical emission heterostructure including an epitaxial ohmic contact on a first substrate, bonding the ohmic contact to a second substrate, and then removing the first substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to semiconductor 
devices, and more particularly to semiconductor devices 
formed of Group II-VI compound semiconductor materials. Microelectronic applications of Group II-VI 
semiconductor materials have been widely investigated. 
In particular, the wide bandgap Group II-VI semiconductor 
zinc selenide (ZnSe), and its related alloys such as zinc 
cadmium selenide (ZnCdSe) and zinc sulfur selenide 
(ZnSSe), are being widely investigated as optoelectronic 
devices which are effective from the blue to the green 
region of the visible spectrum. As is well known to 
those having skill in the art, the wide bandgap of these 
Group II-VI devices compared to their equivalent nearly 
lattice matched Group III-V or elemental semiconductor 
materials, make these wide bandgap Group II-VI 
semiconductors potential candidates for blue to green 
optoelectronic devices. Blue to green optoelectronic 
sources are currently sought for a number of 
applications, including full color electroluminescent 
displays, read-write laser sources for high density 
information storage on magnetic and optical media, 
sources for undersea optical communications and other 
applications. Molecular beam epitaxy and other 
fabrication techniques have recently been developed so  
 
that both n-type and p-type doped layers of zinc selenide 
and other related II-VI semiconductor materials may be 
grown. See for example a publication by Ren et al. 
entitled Substitutional Doping of ZnSe Films, Journal of 
Crystal Growth, Vol. 111, pp. 772-775, 1991. It has also 
long been known to make Schottky contacts to n-type zinc 
selenide using mercury selenide (HgSe). See the 
publications entitled HgSe, a Highly Electronegative 
Stable Metallic Contact for Semiconductor Devices by Best 
et al., Applied Physics Letters, Vol. 29, No. 7, pp. 433-434, 
1976; Highly Electronegative Contacts to Compound 
Semiconductors by Scranton et al., Journal of Vacuum 
Science and Technology, Vol. 14, No. 4, pp. 930-934, 
1977; and Lattice-Matched Heterostructures as Schottky 
Barriers: HgSe/CdSe by Best et al., Journal of Vacuum 
Science Technology, Vol. 16, No. 5, pp. 1130-1133, 1979. As a result of these and other 
developments, at least four research groups have recently 
described the fabrication of blue and/or green light 
emitting diodes and/or laser diodes from Group II-VI 
semiconductors. The first group is from North Carolina 
State University (NCSU) and includes the present 
inventor. The fabrication of blue and green light
