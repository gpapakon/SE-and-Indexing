<ABSTRACT>
In order to carry out automatic sampling of radioactive liquids contained in bottles (14) closed by screw caps, a system is provided which comprises a gripping module (20) designed to grip and hold the bottle, a module (22) for opening and closing the bottles, and a sampling module (24). The gripping module (20) brings each bottle in front of the opening and closure module (22) and it provides force during screwing and unscrewing of the cap during taking of the sample or samples. This sampling module (24) takes the samples by means of a suction adapter (138) and transfers the liquid into a container (26) for the purposes of analysis.

Assembly for taking liquid samples from jugs (14) sealed by screw caps 
(16), characterized in that it comprises: 


a module (20) for gripping the jugs having a gripper (38) able to hold a 
jug in accordance with a substantially vertical axis, gripper opening and 

closing control means and control means (42) for a horizontal displacement 
(60) of the gripper between a gripping station and an opening station for the 

jugs; 
a module (22) for opening and closing the jugs positioned to the right of 
the jug opening station, which has vertically axed nippers (76), means (100) 

for the control of the tightening and loosening of the nippers, means for the 
control of the rotation of the nippers about the vertical axis thereof and 

means (86) for the control of a vertical displacement of the nippers; and 
a module (24) for sampling liquid incorporating a suction endpiece (138), 
which is substantially vertically axed, means (152) for the control of the 

horizontal displacement of said endpiece between a sampling position, in which 
the vertical axes of the nippers and the suction endpiece coincide, and a 

position for the distribution of the liquid sampled in a receptacle, and means 
(146) for the control of the vertical displacement of the suction endpiece. 
Assembly according to claim 1, characterized in that the gripper (38) is 

mounted at the lower end of a vertically axed, rotary shaft (34), displaced 
with respect to the axis of the jug held by said gripper and the control means 

of a horizontal displacement of the gripper incorporate means (60) for controlling 
a rotation of said rotary shaft (34). 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the gripping module (20) also comprises a retractable base (44), which 

can be placed below the gripper (38). 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the gripping module (20) comprises means (66, 68, 70) for locking the 

gripper (38) in position in front of the gripping station and the opening 
station for the jugs.  

 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the opening and closing module (22) comprises a vertically axed pin (74) 

connecting the nippers (76) to the rotation control means, and a rod positioned 
coaxially within the pin and connecting the nippers (76) to the 

tightening and loosening control means. 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the opening and closing module (22) also comprises a retractable drop 

collecting plate (114), which can be placed below the nippers (76). 
Assembly according to claim 6, characterized in that the means for 
controlling a vertical displacement of the nippers (76) acts simultaneously 

on the drop collecting plate (114), so that the latter is placed below the 
nippers (76) when the latter does not occupy a lower screwing and unscrewing 

position. 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the suction endpiece (138) is mounted on a horizontal arm (136), whereof 

a rotation with respect to a vertical axis displaced relative to the endpiece 
is controlled by the means (152) for controlling a horizontal displacement of 

the endpiece. 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the suction endpiece (138) is connected to a hydraulic safety guard (166). 
Assembly according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in 
that the jug gripping station comprises an upper jug supply chute (62) and a 

lower jug discharge chute (64), which are superimposed in accordance with a 
vertical axis and between which can be placed the gripper (38).
