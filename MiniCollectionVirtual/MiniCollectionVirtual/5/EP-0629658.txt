<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rubber-reinforced vinyl aromatic
co(polymer) with an excellent balance of physical and mechanical
properties and high gloss, and a continuous mass-solution
polymerization process for its preparation.More particularly, the invention relates to a diene rubber-reinforced
vinyl aromatic (co)polymer with excellent physical and
mechanical properties such as impact strength, elastic modulus,
yield stress and stress at break, combined with high
gloss, and a continuous mass-solution polymerization process for
producing this copolymer.Vinyl aromatic (co)polymers reinforced with rubber, in particular
with diene rubber, represent a well known class of commercially
available engineering polymers widely described in the literature.Specific examples of these (co)polymers are for example
styrene/acrylonitrile copolymers containing rubber particles, for
example polybutadiene, dispersed in the polymeric matrix,
generally known as ABS resins, and high impact polystyrene,
generally known as HIPS, comprising a continuous polystyrene phase
in which rubber particles, for example polybutadiene, are
dispersed. These rubber-reinforced vinyl aromatic (co)polymers can be
prepared by various polymerization processes which can be
continuous, batch, mass, solution, or combined mass/suspension.
The continuous mass polymerization process is known and described
for example in U.S. patents 2,694,692, 3,243,481 and 3,658,946, and
in published European patent application 0,400,479.This process consists of dissolving the the rubbery material in the
vinyl aromatic monomer or monomer mixture, adding possibly a
radical polymerization initiator and an inert diluent,
and then polymerizing the resulting solution. Immediately after
the polymerization reaction commences, the solution of rubbery
material in the monomer or monomer mixture separates into two
phases, of which the former, consisting of a solution of the
rubber in the monomer, initially forms the continuous phase,
whereas the latter, consisting of a solution of the
resultant (co)polymer in the monomer, remains dispersed in
form of droplets in said continuous phase. As polymerization and
hence conversion proceed the quantity of the latter phase
increases at the expense of the former one. As soon as the volume of
the latter phase equals that of the former, a phase change occurs,
generally known as phase inversion.When this phase inversion takes place, droplets of rubber solution form
in the polymer solution. These rubber solution droplets incorporate
