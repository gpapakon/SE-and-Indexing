<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to skin regenerating cosmetic 
compositions comprising as active ingredient 3-60% by weight 
of extracts of Stellaria media and Viola tricolor. The increasing number of environmental injuries, the 
polluted air, numerous flats not providing suitable micro-climate 
are causing various skin complaints in many people. 
In mild cases these appear in form of pathologically dry, 
inflammable, scurfy, itching skin deformations. When the 
skin problems are more serious dermatologists suggest the 
use of pharmaceutical compositions generally containing 
synthetic active ingredients. In case of relatively mild deformations in the literature 
various paramedicinal or cosmetic composition are recommended 
to cease the symptoms. Such a composition is described for example in the HU-PS 
195.420 which contains extracts of St. John,s wort and 
marigold, tocopherol, collagen, allantoin, panthenol, jojoba 
oil, chamomile oil and chamomile extract. According to HU-PS-195.915 the extract of different 
parts of the maize plant prepared with water or with water 
miscible pharmaceutically acceptable organic solvents is 
formulated together with the usual excipients, diluents or 
vehicles to skin regenerating and hydrating cosmetic composition. A topical composition of similar effect is described in 
HU-PS 184.410, wich contains as active ingredient the 
aqueous or ethanolic extracts of drugs of species belonging 
to the Fagaceae and/or Chenopodicae and/or Rosaceae families.  
 CH-A-660454 and Hagers Handbuch der pharmaceutischen 
Praxis, Vol. 6, 1979, p. 482-484 both disclose the use of 
crude extracts of Viola tricolor in cosmetics. With regard to the great variety of symptoms, the 
different sensitivity of the individuals, the potential 
allergic skin reactions, no composition is known which could 
be generally applied for the above group of symptoms.  
 The aim of our work was to prepare a new cosmetic 
composition which would enrich the choice of available 
compositions. Our further aim was to create a synergetic 
composition free of harmful side effects, comprising essentially 
natural active ingredients, suitable for the treatment 
of pathologically dry, inflammable, scurfy, itching 
skin deformations, eczemas and acnes in milder cases which 
do not require medical intervention. We have surprisingly found that the above aims can be 
reached with a composition comprising as active ingredient 
extracts of chickweed (Stellaria media) and pansy (Viola 
tricolor). The chickweed belongs to the family of
