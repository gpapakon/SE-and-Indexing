<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a process for producing a 
monoalkenylbenzene which comprises alkenylating a side chain 

of an aromatic hydrocarbon compound having at least one 
hydrogen atom bonded at α-position of the side chain (such as 

xylene) with a conjugated diene having 4 or 5 carbon atoms 
(such as butadiene) in the presence 
of a catalyst produced by 
calcining the mixture of potassium hydroxide and aluminum 

hydroxide and then heat treating the calcined product together 
with metallic sodium in an atmosphere of an inert gas. 

According to the aforesaid process, an industrially useful 
monoalkenylbenzene can be produced in high yield at a low cost 

with enhanced safety.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 
a monoalkenylbenzene. More particularly, it pertains to a 
process for producing a monoalkenylbenzene by subjecting 
a monocyclic alkylaromatic 
hydrocarbon compound having at least one hydrogen 
atom bonded at α-position of the side chain to side-chain 
alkenylation by the use of a conjugated diene having 4 or 5 
carbon atoms. A monoalkenylbenzene is useful as the starting 
intermediate material for various organic compounds typified 
by high molecular monomers and pharmaceutical preparations. 
As an example, 5-(o-tolyl)-2-pentene that is produced from o-xylene 
and 1,3-butadiene can be converted into industrially 
useful 2,6-naphthalene-dicarboxylic acid by ring closure 
followed by dehydrogenation, isomerization and oxidation. As a process for producing a monoalkenylbenzene by 
subjecting a monocyclic alkylaromatic 
hydrocarbon compound to side-chain 
alkenylation by the use of a conjugated diene having 4 or 5 
carbon atoms, there is known the process in which is employed 
as a catalyst an alkali metal such as sodium and potassium or 
an alloy thereof. For example, German Patent No. 557514 discloses the use 
of metallic sodium as a catalyst in the above-mentioned 
process and Eberhardt et al. describes the use of metallic 
sodium supported on an alkaline earth metal oxide as a 
catalyst in J. Org. Chem., vol. 30 (1965), pp 82 to 84.  
 Likewise, there are disclosed the use of metallic 
potassium in Japanese Patent Publication No. 17973/1975, the 
use of a potassium/sodium alloy or a mixture of metallic 
potassium and metallic sodium in Japanese Patent Publication 
Nos. 17975/1975 and 8930/1976, and the use of metallic 
potassium supported on an alkali metal oxide or an alkaline 
earth metal oxide in USP No. 3244758 and the aforementioned J. 
Org. Chem., vol. 30 (1965), pp 82 to 84, each as the catalyst 
in the above-mentioned process. There is also disclosed the use of the mixture obtained 
by heat treating a potassium compound and metallic sodium at 
300°C or a temperature not lower than 350°C as the catalyst in 
the above-mentioned process in Japanese Patent Application 
Laid-Open Nos. 27929/1972 and 31935/1972. Among the aforestated processes, the process in which is 
used as a catalyst metallic sodium with or without being 
supported on an alkaline earth metal oxide is impractical 
because of insufficiency in both catalytic activity and 
selectivity of reaction. The process in which is used as a 
catalyst, metallic potassium, a
