<ABSTRACT>
Shoe/ankle-boot system with quickly replaceable sole 
element, the shoe/ankle-boot system advantageously 

comprising a removable inner lining shoe, whereby in the 
lower part of the shoe/ankle-boot system (10) and in the 

upper part of the sole (20) are comprised reciprocal mating 
anchorage means (12-14-114-18) and reciprocal clamping 

assembly means (16) associated with actuation means, the 
reciprocal clamping assembly means (16) being located in a 

wholly protected area, the actuation means being positioned 
at the rear of the shoe/ankle-boot system (10) in an area 

for the most part protected, the reciprocal clamping 
assembly means (16) comprising an erection (22) in the upper 

part of the sole (20) and a spring catch (17) in the lower 
part (11) of the shoe/ankle-boot system (10), the spring 

catch (17) being able to move perpendicularly to that lower 
part (11) and being resiliently (34) held in its working 

position and being associated with actuation means and 
safety means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a system comprising a shoe/ankle-boot 
and a quickly replaceable sole element according to the 
main claim. To be more exact, this invention concerns a system 
comprising a shoe/ankle-boot and advantageously, but not 
necessarily, including an inner removable lining shoe of the 
type used with skiing boots and also a replaceable sole 
element. The soles which can be fitted to this shoe/ankle-boot are 
normal soles or specially made soles. The state of the art covers systems comprising a 
shoe/ankle-boot and a removable inner lining shoe and a 
replaceable sole element. A shoe/ankle-boot has been disclosed which consists of a 
thermal-resistant material and is combined with a removable 
inner lining shoe and a replaceable sole element. Two sole elements are provided, of which one is equipped 
with a skate for ice skating, while the other includes a 
plurality of rollers for use on the road in imitation of ice 
skating. This system of the state of the art entails the drawback 
that the sole elements in their two special forms are 
connected to the ankle-boot by means of screws; this 
involves many drawbacks such as the long replacement times, 
the need for tools to tighten and unscrew the screws, the 
risks of blockage of the screws owing to the infiltration of 
water and/or ice, the risks of excessive pressure by the 
head of the screws with resulting breakages or micro-cracks 
in one or another plastic part, the necessity to remove the 
shoe or ankle-boot from the foot so as to carry out the  
 
replacement, etc. Moreover, the structure of the sole element has been 
specifically designed for the task to be performed and does 
not permit applications of other different equipment. A system has also been disclosed in EP-A-0.510.384 which 
provides a shoe/ankle-boot with a quickly replaceable sole 
element, the shoe/ankle-boot including advantageously a 
removable inner lining shoe, whereby 
in the lower part of the shoe/ankle-boot and in the upper 
part of the sole there are reciprocal mating anchorage means 
and reciprocal clamping assembly means which can be quickly 
released from each other from the outside. This system, although excellent, entails difficulties of 
actuation and can be at least momentarily obstructed by the 
cold and by ice. Moreover, the systems of the state of the art do not 
provide a system providing safety against release. The present applicants have designed, tested and embodied 
this invention to overcome the shortcomings of the state of 
the art and to be

<CLAIMS>
A system comprising a shoe/ankle-boot and a quickly 
replaceable sole element, in which in the lower part of the 

shoe/ankle-boot (10) and in the upper part of the sole (20) 
are comprised reciprocal mating anchorage means (12, 14, 

114, 18) and reciprocal clamping assembly means (16) 
associated with actuation means (26, 28), the system being 

characterised in that the reciprocal clamping assembly means 
(16), when the shoe/ankle-boot (10) and the sole (20) are 

connected together, are located in a wholly protected area, 
and the actuation means (26, 28) are positioned at the rear 

of the shoe in an area for the most part protected, and in 
that the reciprocal clamping assembly means (16) comprise an 

erection (22) in the upper part of the sole (20) and in the 
lower part (11) of the shoe/ankle-boot (10) a spring catch 

(17) able to move perpendicularly to that lower part (11) 
and being resiliently (34) held in its working position and 

being associated with the actuation means (26, 28) and with safety 
means (32, 33). 
System as in Claim 1, in which the sole (20) comprises 
at its frontal end a tooth (21) cooperating with a mating 

frontal prong (13) included at the front of the shoe/ankle-boot 
(10). 
System as in Claim 1 or 2, in which the reciprocal 
clamping assembly means (16) comprise support means (24) 

protruding from the lower part (11) of the shoe/ankle-boot (10) and 
containing holes (36) for the pivoting of the spring catch 

(17). 
System as in any claim hereinbefore, in which the 
actuation means comprise a transmission lever (26) extending 

vertically outside the rear of the shoe/ankle-boot (10) and 
anchored to the spring catch (17) in such a way as to be 

able to oscillate.  
 
System as in Claim 4, in which the transmission lever 
(26) cooperates with a hollow (27) and with a protective 

screen (38) extending vertically at the rear of the 
shoe/ankle-boot (10). 
System as in Claim 4, in which the transmission lever 
(26) is associated in an oscillatory manner with a clamping 

lever (28) including an anchorage seating (33) cooperating 
with an anchorage tooth (32) solidly fixed to the rear (39) 

of the shoe/ankle-boot (10), the anchorage seating (33) and 
anchorage tooth (32) constituting the safety means. 
System as in Claim 6, in which the anchorage tooth (32) 
is solidly fixed to a protrusion (31) extending upwards at 

the rear (39) of the shoe/ ankle-boot (10). 
System as in Claim 7, in which the protrusion (31) 
contains a slot to contain and guide a pivot (29) providing 

oscillatory connection between the transmission lever (26) 

and clamping lever (28). 
System as in any claim hereinbefore, in which the 
erection (22) includes a plane (23) inclined in the 

direction of insertion of the sole (20). 
System as in any claim hereinbefore, in which the 
spring catch (17) includes at its frontal end an inclined 

plane (25).
