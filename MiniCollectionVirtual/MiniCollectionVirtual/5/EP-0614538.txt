<ABSTRACT>
A system for using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to obtain information relating to geologic structures. The system employs a variable sample window (W1, W2, W3) which increases sampling efficiency by allowing the system to optimize the sampling interval, thereby maximizing the amount of data which can be obtained in a series of data samples.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for
obtaining quantitative and qualitative measurements of
geologic structures. More specifically, the present
invention provides an efficient and effective system
for using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques for
obtaining information relating to geologic structures.As is known, fluid flow properties of porous
media have long been of interest in the oil industry.
In an article by A. Timur, entitled "Pulsed Nuclear
Magnetic Resonance Studies of Porosity, Movable Fluid,
and Permeability of Sandstones," in the Journal of
Petroleum Technology, June 1969, page 775, it was
shown experimentally that NMR methods provide a rapid
non-destructive determination of porosity, movable
fluid, and permeability of rock formation.It is known that when an assembly of magnetic
moments, such as those of hydrogen nuclei, are exposed
to a static magnetic field they tend to align along
the direction of the magnetic field, resulting in bulk
magnetization. The rate at which equilibrium is
established in such bulk magnetization upon provision
of a static magnetic field is characterized by the
parameter T1, known as the spin-lattice relaxation
time. It has been observed that the mechanism which
determines the value of T1 depends on molecular
dynamics. In liquids, molecular dynamics are a
function of molecular size and inter-molecular
interactions. Therefore, water and different types of
oil have different T1 values.In the heterogeneous media, such as a porous
solid which contains liquid in its pores, the dynamics
of molecules close to the solid surface are also
significant and differ from the dynamics of the bulk
liquid. It may thus be appreciated that the T1
parameter provides valuable information relating to
well logging parameters.There exist a number of techniques for disturbing
the equilibrium of an assembly of magnetic moments,
such as those of hydrogen nuclei, for T1 parameter
measurements. Each of these techniques provides means
for measuring T1 of a rock formation within a certain
volume (called the "sensitive volume") which is
determined mainly by the shape of the magnetic field
surrounding the magnetic structure. The signal-to-noise
ratio of the measurement is limited by the ratio
of the sensitive volume to the uniformity (maximum
flux density minus flux density) of the magnetic
field within said volume, and increases in proportion
to this ratio.In any given nuclear magnetic resonance
instrument configuration, the apparatus will respond
only to nuclei residing within the
