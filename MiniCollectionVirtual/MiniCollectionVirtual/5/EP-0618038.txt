<ABSTRACT>
A seam welding wheel (10) is refurbished by 
forming an outer rim (18) to be fitted to the remaining 

inner ring (12). The outer rim has an inner diameter 
slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the inner 

ring. The outer rim is heated to expand it sufficiently 
to fit onto the inner ring. The heated outer rim is 

fitted onto the inner ring and allowed to cool so as to 
shrink onto the inner ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns refurbishment of seam 
welding wheels. Seam welding wheels for a seam welding process 
have a zirconium copper or chrome rim which wears down 
with use. Once a certain amount of the rim has been used 
up, a wheel becomes unusable and so is replaced. The 
remaining core or inner ring is then disposed of as 
scrap. Welding wheels are expensive and disposing of 
the remainder as scrap represents a significant waste of 
money. An object of this invention is, therefore, to 
provide a process for refurbishing seam welding wheels 
after use rather than disposing of them as scrap. According to the invention it is proposed that a 
seam welding wheel inner ring have an outer rim of 
suitable material formed on the inner ring, whereby the 
welding wheel becomes reusable. In a preferred process according to the invention 
a ring of seam welding wheel material is formed with an 
inner diameter slightly smaller than the outer diameter 
of the inner ring. The outer ring is heated so that it  
 
expands sufficiently to fit onto the inner ring, as a 
rim whereby cooling of the outer ring shrinks it onto 
the inner ring. The inner ring and the rim are then 
preferably welded together say using the 
electron beam technique. A full penetration electron 
beam weld is preferably made from one side only. Before fitting the rim, the inner ring is 
preferably cleaned and machined to a desired diameter, 
typically to approximately 230mm. The rim is then 
preferably machined to give it approximately the same 
inner diameter as the outer diameter of the inner ring. The outer rim will be heated to a temperature 
sufficient for the desired expansion thereof. 
Typically, the outer rim will be heated up to 40 to 50 
degrees centigrade, especially about 45 degrees. When the outer rim has been fitted onto the inner 
ring, the two parts are preferably clamped together 
while the outer rim cools, in order to ensure accurate 
positioning of the outer rim on the inner ring. Once the outer rim has been fitted to the inner 
ring and the two parts welded together, if desired, the 
completed wheel may be machined conveniently on a lathe 
according to customers instructions and requirements. It is possible to carry out a surface treatment 
of a refurbished and welding wheel for stress relieving 
and to produce a cosmetic finish. A suitable surface  
 
treatment comprises the step of blasting the wheel with 
blastbeads under air pressure. The outer rim used for refurbishing seam welding 
wheels is preferably made of a

A process for refurbishing a seam welding wheel 
comprising the steps of forming an outer rim for the 

remaining inner ring which has an inner diameter 
slightly smaller than the outer diameter of the inner 

ring, heating the outer rim so that it expands 
sufficiently to fit onto the inner ring, fitting the 

heated outer rim onto the inner ring and cooling the 
outer rim to shrink onto the inner ring.
