<ABSTRACT>
A biological process for predominantly producing an 
optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid having a phenyl 

group directly from a racemic α-hydroxynitrile or a mixture 
of an aldehyde corresponding to the nitrile and prussic acid 

as a substrate is disclosed, comprising reacting a 
microorganism belonging to the genus 
Gordona
 with the 
substrate in a neutral to basic aqueous medium. A desired 

optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid having a phenyl 
group can be obtained quantitatively at a high optical 

purity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a biological process for
producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid having
a phenyl group. More particularly, it relates to a process
for producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic acid
having a phenyl group as represented by formula (I) shown
below, by the action of a microorganism capable of
asymmetrically hydrolyzing a nitrile group of a racemic α-hydroxynitrile
represented by formula (II) shown below. The
optically active a-hydroxycarboxylic acid of formula (I) is
of industrial importance as a starting material for
synthesizing pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, such as
antibiotics or drugs acting on the sympathetic nervous
system, and as a resolving reagent.Known processes for producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic
acid having a phenyl group include optical
resolution of racemates by crystallization or chromatography
and asymmetric synthesis through organochemical procedures.
These processes generally involve complicated operations,
only to attain a low yield of a product.To overcome these problems, biological processes
utilizing microorganisms have been proposed. For example, it
has been proposed to asymmetrically hydrolyze substituted or 
unsubstituted mandelonitrile or substituted or unsubstituted
mandelamide by the action of a microorganism belonging to the
genus Alcaligenes, Pseudomonas, Rhodopseudomonas,
Corynebacterium, Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Mycobacterium,
Rhodococcus or Candida to obtain optically active mandelic
acid or derivatives thereof as disclosed in European Patent
Publication No. 0 348 901 A (corresponding to JP-A-2-84198
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means an "unexamined
published Japanese patent application")) and Applied and
Environmental Microbiology, Vol. 57, pp. 3028-3032 (1991).
It is also known to obtain a predominant proportion of R(-)-mandelic
acid or a derivative thereof directly from racemic
mandelonitrile or a derivative thereof by the action of a
microorganism belonging to the genus Pseudomonas,
Alcaligenes, Acinetobacter, Caseobacter, Nocardia, Bacillus,
Brevibacterium or Aureobacterium, as disclosed in U.S. Patent
5,223,416 (corresponding to JP-A-4-218385, JP-A-4-99495 and
JP-A-4-99496).In these biological processes, discovery of a new
microorganism with higher activity and higher optical
selectivity would produce a great industrial benefit.The present inventors searched extensively for a
microorganism capable of producing an optically active α-hydroxycarboxylic
acid having a phenyl group with industrial 
ad
