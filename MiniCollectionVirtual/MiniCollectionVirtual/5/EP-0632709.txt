<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of medical diagnostics. More particularly, the present invention relates to the design of catheters for determining internal dimensions of body lumens, such as the diameter of blood vessels.Many bodily diseases and/or abnormalities can
be diagnosed by measuring the condition, i.e. size and/or
compliance, of body members. One example is the vascular
disease atherosclerosis, which involves the narrowing of
a blood vessel such as an artery. Such narrowed regions
are often referred to as lesions, stenosed regions, and
the like. The narrowing of the blood vessel in turn
results in the restriction, and in extreme cases, the
cessation, of blood flow to the capillary system served
by that particular artery. Treatment for atherosclerosis
has included both surgical and non-surgical techniques.
The surgical techniques involve the removal of the
portion of the vessel containing the disease and
replacement thereof with a vessel segment taken from
another part of the body. Non-surgical techniques
involve the use of an intravascular catheter. These
techniques include mechanical devices which remove the
occluding material in the vessel, laser devices which
vaporize the occluding material, and balloon catheter
devices which compress the occluding material against the
vascular wall.Heretofore, atherosclerosis has usually been
diagnosed by inserting a catheter into the vessel of
interest and then injecting a contrast agent into the
vessel through the catheter. The blood flow will carry 
the contrast agent along the vessel so that the vessel
can be radiographically imaged with a display device such
as a fluoroscope. The radiographic image of the vessel
is then reviewed in order to estimate the internal
diameter of the vessel to determine if there is any
abnormal narrowing of the vessel which may have occurred
due to disease. If any narrowing is observed, the extent
(percentage) of narrowing is estimated from the
radiographic image by measuring the vessel diameter both
at and immediately before the region of narrowing with a
ruler, calipers or similar device. Such a measurement is
typically not particularly accurate since it relies on
discerning an ill-defined boundary in a single plane.
Stenotic material outside of the image plane can be
missed, resulting in average errors of approximately 30%.
Such inaccuracy hinders adequate characterization of
vascular disease.Another significant vascular condition known as
"hardening of the arteries" typically occurs with aging
and

A system for measuring an internal dimension
of a body lumen, the system comprising a catheter

which comprises:

a catheter body having a proximal end, a distal
end, and an inflation lumen (40) extending from the

proximal end to near the distal end;
an inflatable balloon (42) disposed near the
distal end of the catheter body and in fluid

communication with the inflation lumen (40); means (41) for introducing a measured volume of inflation medium through a proximal end of the inflation lumen (40) to inflate the inflatable balloon (42) to a pressure of up to 2.7 x 10
4
 Pa (200 mmHg); and
means (43) for measuring the pressure of the
inflation medium within the balloon (42),

   
characterised in that
 the system further
comprises means (44) for calculating the internal

dimension based on the value of the measured volume of
inflation medium at one or more pressures below about

2.7 x 10
4
 Pa (200 mm Hg).
A system as in claim 1 wherein the balloon
(42), when inflated, has a length in the range from 3

to 10 millimeters and a diameter in the range from 1
to 5 millimeters.
A system as in claim 2, wherein the means
(43) for measuring the pressure of the inflation

medium is disposed in the balloon (42).
A system as in claim 2, wherein the catheter
body further includes a pressure measurement lumen

(54) extending from the balloon (42) to the proximal
end of the catheter body, wherein the means for

measuring the inflation medium pressure is disposed
near the proximal end of the catheter body and in 

fluid communication with the pressure measurement
lumen (54).
A system as in any preceding claim, further
including a second balloon disposed on the catheter

body proximally of the inflatable balloon, whereby
blood flow can be occluded by inflation of the second

balloon.
A system as in any preceding claim, further
comprising a sealed volume of inflation medium whereby

the inflation medium may be moved into and out of the
balloon (42) while at all times being maintained

within the catheter.
The system of claim 1 wherein the balloon
(42) when inflated is generally cylindrical and has a

length in the range from 3 mm to 10 mm and a diameter
in the range of from 1mm to 5mm; and

   said means (44) for calculating the internal
dimension of the body lumen is based on the difference

between (a) the volume of inflation medium required to
produce a preselected pressure of inflation medium

within the balloon (42) when the balloon is
unconstrained and (b) the volume of inflation medium

required to produce the same pressure of inflation
medium within the balloon when the balloon is at a

location within the body lumen.
A system as claimed in either of claims 1 or 
7 wherein the catheter body includes at least a second

lumen (54) which is connected at its distal end to the
interior of the inflatable balloon (42) and wherein

the means (56) for measuring the pressure of the
inflation medium connected to said second lumen.
A system as claimed in either of claims 1 or
7, wherein the means for measuring the pressure of the

inflation medium comprises a pressure sensor disposed
within the interior of the inflatable balloon (42).
A system as claimed in either of claims 1 or
7, wherein the means for measuring the pressure of the

inflation medium comprises a pressure sensor (43)
disposed at or near the proximal end of the inflation

lumen.
