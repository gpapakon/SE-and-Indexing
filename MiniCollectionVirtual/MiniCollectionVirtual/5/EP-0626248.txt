<ABSTRACT>
The hollow mould serves for manufacturing hollow bodies with handles from thermoplastic materials by the blow-moulding process. At the point of the hollow mould (4) shaping the hollow body where the handle is to be formed, the wall (5) of the hollow mould projects into the mould cavity (11) in a balcony-like manner. A plunger (9) is mounted displaceably against the contact surface (7) of the balcony-like projection (6) extending transversely or obliquely with respect to the mould wall (5) of the hollow mould. The lateral bounding surface (12) of the plunger (9), facing the mould cavity (11) of the hollow mould (4), forms part of the mould wall (5) of the mould cavity (11) when the plunger (9) is moved against the contact surface (7). Recessed in the contact surface (7) or in the end face (13) of the plunger (9) is a groove-like hollow (14), which extends over the width of the contact surface (7) or the end face (13) of the plunger (9) and forms the handle. The displacing direction of the plunger (9) or its axis is arranged at an acute angle with respect to the axis of the hollow mould. The curved bounding wall forming the balcony-like projection (6) has a continuous progression.

A hollow mould for manufacturing hollow bodies with handles from thermoplastic
materials, in particular for manufacturing containers using blow moulding, characterised

in that at that site of the hollow mould (4) shaping the hollow body at which the handle
to be formed is located, the wall (5) of the hollow mould projects balcony-like towards or

into the mould cavity (11), and a punch (9) is mounted so as to be displaceable towards
the contact surface (7), extending obliquely or at an incline with regard to the mould wall

(5) of the hollow mould, of the balcony-like projection (6), the lateral boundary surface
(12), facing the mould cavity (11) of the hollow mould (4), of which punch (9) forms

part of the mould wall (5) of the mould cavity (11) when the punch (9) is moved against
the contact surface (7), and a channel-like cavity (14) which extends over the width of

the contact surface (7) or the front end (3 [sic-13]) of the punch (9) and forms the handle

(3) is made in the contact surface (7) and/or in the end face (13) of the punch (9).
A hollow mould in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the displacement
direction of the punch (9) or its axis is arranged at an acute angle to the axis of the

hollow mould.
A hollow mould in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that when the punch
(9) is withdrawn and located at a distance from the contact surface (7), the opening cross-section

bounded by the contact surface (7) and the end face (13) of the punch (9) is

greater than that opening cross-section bounded by the wall (15), adjacent to the mould
cavity (11), of the punch guide (8) and the lateral boundary surface (12), facing the

mould cavity (11), of the punch (9).
A hollow mould in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the convex boundary
wall forming the balcony-like projection (6) has a continuous course.
A hollow mould in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the
depth (t), measured in a transverse plane of the hollow mould, of the punch end-face (13)

co-operating with the contact surface (7) of the balcony-like projection (6) is smaller than
the depth (T) of the punch guide (8) measured in the same transverse plane. 
A hollow mould in accordance with Claim 3, characterised in that the ratio of the
opening cross-sections is at least 1:2 to 1:3.
