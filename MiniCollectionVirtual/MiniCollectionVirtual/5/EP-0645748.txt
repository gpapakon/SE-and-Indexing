<ABSTRACT>
In an illumination system which comprises a plurality of electrically operated, light emitting elements (4) in a spatially distributed arrangement, which elements are supplied with current by means of two electrical lines (3; 3a,b) in the shape of flexible stranded wires surrounded by an insulating sheath, a plane-like distribution of light sources even over a relatively large area is made possible in conjunction with a simple design, safe use and suitability for the widest range of light sources and supply voltages in that the electrical lines (3; 3a,b) form a network (1) with a plurality of knots (2), in which knots (2) the two electrical lines (3; 3a,b) run in direct mutual proximity and in that each of the light emitting elements (4) is arranged in one of the knots (2) and is connected there to the two electrical lines (3; 3a,b).
