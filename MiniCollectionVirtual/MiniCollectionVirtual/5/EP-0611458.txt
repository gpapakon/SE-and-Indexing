 RADIALLY SYMMETRIC HOLOGRAM AND METHOD OF FABRICATING THE SAMEField of the InventionThis invention relates to holography, and more particularly to hologram fabrication methods and the holograms fabricated thereby. Background ofthe InventionImprovements in holographic technology have caused holography to play a major role in modern optical systems. Today, holograms are widely used as diffractive optical elements in a wide variety of applications including high resolution imaging systems, focusing and collimating optics, aspheric element testing, and chromatic aberration correction of refractive elements.It is currently known to fabricate holograms for diffractive optics by creating interference among coherent light beams on a photographic plate and then developing the photographic plate. See U.S. Patent 4,607,914 to Fienup entitled Optical System Design Techniques Using Holographic Optical Element, U. S. Patent 4, 649, 351 to Veldkamp et al . entitled Apparatus and Method for Coherently Adding Laser Beams, and U.S. Patent 4,813,762 to Leger et al. entitled Coherent Beam Combining of Lasers Using Microlenses and Diffractive Coupling. 

 Unfortunately, holograms produced by interference among coherent light beams contain internal features which produce the hologram's interference fringes. These interferometric holograms must typically be produced individually, using precision equipment to produce interference among coherent light beams on a photographic plate. These holograms, therefore, are difficult to mass produce. In order to overcome the mass production problems with interferometric holograms. ComputerGenerated Holograms ("CGH") have been developed. CGHs have been fabricated by calculating the desired holographic pattern to perform a particular function and then forming the pattern on a glass or other substrate using photolithographic or other techniques. This technique is described, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,960,311 to Moss et al. entitled Holographic Exposure System For Computer Generated Holograms .It is also known to design these CGHs using iterative discrete encoding. In iterative discrete encoding, the hologram is divided into a two-dimensional array of rectangular cells. An initial transmittance value for each rectangular cell is chosen and the optimized phase for the hologram is calculated. An iterative optimization process is then used to optimize the transmittance values of the cells. An error function for the hologram is then calculated based upon the image quality. A single cell is
