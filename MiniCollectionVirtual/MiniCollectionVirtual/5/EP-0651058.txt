<ABSTRACT>
The second flow of pulverulent materials is introduced at a controlled flow rate and the control of the first flow rate is rendered insensitive to the perturbations generated by the introduction of the second flow by controlling the first flow rate directly or indirectly upstream of the point of injection of the second flow.

<CLAIMS>
Process for feeding a second stream of pulverulent materials into a
pneumatic conveying pipe carrying a first controllable flow of pulverulent materials,

characterized in that the second stream of pulverulent materials is fed at a controlled
rate and that the first pneumatically conveyed flow is controlled, directly or indirectly,

at a control point located upstream of the injection point of the second stream ; the
pressure inside the line being maintained, by virtue of the control point, at a higher

pressure than the injection pressure of the second stream, in order to render the flow
of the first stream insensitive to the disturbances caused by the feeding of the

second stream.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the first flow is
controlled by measuring the first flow of pulverulent materials and adjusting it to a

predetermined value upstream of the injection point of the second stream.
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that the first flow is
controlled by measuring the pressure and adjusting it inside the pneumatic conveying

line to a predetermined value upstream of the injection point of the second stream.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the
second stream of pulverulent materials is injected at an injection point located in the

heart of the first stream of pulverulent materials.
Process according to claim 4, characterized in that the second stream
of pulverulent materials is injected vertically into the pneumatic conveying line in the

direction of flow.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the
second flow of pulverulent materials is maintained at a constant rate.
