<ABSTRACT>
A method for manufacturing a printing plate comprises 
the steps of extruding a molten polymer sheet (18) onto a 

moving a carrier web (20) to achieve self-lamination in a 
nip-free manner. The polymer is preferably 

photocurable.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of
printing plates, and more particularly to the preparation of flexographic relief
image printing plates from photocurable elements.Printing plates which entail the use of at least one layer formed of a
negative-working photocurable composition are exposed through an
image-bearing transparency to radiation of an appropriate wave length
(commonly termed "actinic" radiation) to cure or harden the composition.
The photocurable composition is initially soluble in a chosen developer
solvent; but it is rendered insoluble in those areas that are photocured as a
result of exposure to actinic radiation. Development of the exposed layer or
layers thus removes the composition in non-exposed areas, leaving a relief
image defined by the cured composition. The relief image "plate" may then
be inked and used to print the image onto substrates such as packaging
materials, cartons, and boxes.One known process for manufacturing printing plates from
photocurable compositions involves passing between two sheet supports and
into the gap of nipped calendering rolls a hot molten mass of an elastomer
binder, monomeric compound, and photoinitiator. The hot polymer mass is
calendered into the final shape and thickness of the final printing plate
product. Another printing plate manufacturing process involves extruding
the photocurable polymer composition as a thick coating and laminating one
side of this coated layer to a releasable cover sheet using nipped laminating
cylinders, and thereafter cooling and grinding of the polymer layer, then
attaching a support sheet to the ground side.The use of full-width nipped calendering or laminating rollers,
however, creates the risk that particles and foreign matter can be forcibly
embedded into the soft polymer. In addition, when molten polymer is passed
between nipped rollers, a release agent must be applied to the contacting
roller constantly to avoid wrinkling of the polymer layer surface and/or
sticking of the polymer to the contacting roller after passing through the nip. US-A-4,403,566 describes a method for making a
printing element comprising a photo curable polymer layer
in which the photo curable polymer is extruded in a nip-free
manner from the moving dye onto a stationary plate
making surface.US-A-5,135,827 describes a process for manufacturing
elastomeric photopolymer printing plates by extruding
molten polymer between two polyester sheets and colendaring
the laminate.JP-A-60-191261 describes a process for

<CLAIMS>
A method for manufacturing a printing element comprising the steps of:

extruding a molten polymer sheet (18), which is or
will become photocurable and comprises an elastomer

compound, an ethylenically unsaturated compound having at
least one terminal ethylenic group, and a photoinitiator,

the sheet having major faces extending continuously and
coextensively in a portion of the sheet width between the

opposite sheet edges;
moving a carrier web (20) at a location subsequent to
the point of extrusion such that a major face of the

extruded polymer sheet, while in a molten state, is self-laminated
continuously and directed in a nip-free manner to

the moving carrier; and
attaching a base sheet (38) to the opposite major face
of the polymer sheet.
The method of claim 1 further comprising the step of
providing a sheet die (14) having a die opening (16)

defining a center plane (50), and said step of extruding
further comprises positioning the sheet die center plane at

an angle that is 0째-180째 with respect to the carrier moving
away from the initial point of self-lamination (24).
The method of claim 2 wherein said angle is 90째-135째
between said sheet die center plane and the carrier moving

away from the initial point of self-lamination.
The method of claim 2 or claim 3 wherein said polymer
sheet is being self-laminated to said carrier moving away

from the point of self-lamination, for at least a certain
distance after the initial point of self-lamination, in a

direction increasing in angle away from the initial angle
at which self-lamination occurs.
The method of claim 4 wherein the carrier is moved
upon a rotating cylinder (26), and said molten polymer

sheet is extruded onto said carrier web while said carrier
web is being moved upon said rotating cylinder. 
The method of any preceding claim comprising the step
of cooling the self-laminated extruded polymer sheet, and

the step of grinding the polymer sheet at least once after
the sheet has cooled, and before the step of attaching the

base sheet.
The method of any preceding claim further comprising
the step of providing a sheet die having adjustable die

bolts (72, 76) operative to adjust the die opening.
The method of claim 7 wherein said sheet die further
comprises lip adjusting bolts (72) and lip adjusting bolt

heaters (76) operative to adjust the die opening.
The method of any preceding claim further comprising
the ste
p of measuring the thickness of the polymer sheet
after self-lamination of the sheet to the moving carrier

and before the step of attaching a base sheet.
The method of any preceding claim further comprising
the step of providing a sensor (27) operative to generate

an output signal corresponding to the thickness of the
polymer sheet after self-lamination of the sheet to the

moving carrier and before the step of attaching a base
sheet.
The method of claim 10 further comprising the step of
providing a monitor operative to display a visual profile

corresponding to the output signal of the sensor.
The method of claim 10 or claim 11 further comprising
the step of providing a controller (60) having an output,

and providing lip adjusting means responsive to said
controller output whereby the lip of the dye is adjustable.
