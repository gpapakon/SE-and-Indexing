<ABSTRACT>
A fully automated prework station comprises: a first 
conveyor line (20) for carrying sampler containers (1) to an 

automatic centrifuge; an automatic centrifuge (30) located near 
a terminating end of the first conveyor line; a second conveyor 

line (40) for transporting the sampler containers that have 
undergone a centrifugal separation process in the centrifuge to 

a specimen extraction position; an automatic plug opening device 
(50) installed halfway in the second conveyor line; a specimen 

extraction and distributed delivery device (60) for drawing 
specimens from the sampler containers that were unplugged by the 

automatic plug opening device and then delivering and 
distributing each of the extracted specimens among other 

containers (6) each assigned with a specific inspection; and a 
control means (80) for controlling the devices in a coordinated 

way.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sample preparation 
apparatus or a prework station for processing specimens of, for 
example, blood, before they are analysed. In order to prevent blood infection accidents, to achieve 
a reduction in labor and to facilitate real time diagnosis, 
various experimental attempts have been made in recent years not 
only to enable automatic performance of analyses such as clinical 
biochemical and immunological analysis of blood, but also to 
permit automatic transfer of sampler containers containing blood 
to an automatic analyzing apparatus. Conventional preprocessing of specimens currently requires 
the intervention of many people. The following are examples of 
the type of operations which are performed: feeding sampler 
containers such as sampler tubes containing sampled blood to a 
centrifuge where they are subjected to a centrifugal separation 
process; removing rubber plugs from the sampler containers that 
have undergone the centrifugal separation process; and drawing 
specimens from the unplugged sampler containers and distributing 
each of the extracted specimens among other sampler containers, 
each assigned for a specific type of analysis. In the 
centrifugal separation process, for example, the sampler 
containers are mostly processed in batches by a person handling 
individual sampler containers. The unplugging of containers is 
also done manually. The process of delivering and distributing 
the extracted specimen among different inspections is carried out 
mostly manually, although an automatic specimen extraction and 
distributed delivery apparatus is employed in parts of the 
process. In this way, a series of processes is interrupted by 
manual operations. While highly sophisticated techniques have 
already been introduced into inspection equipment and an  
 
information processing field, there is little improvement 
observed in automating the prework or preprocessing systems. 
Under these circumstances, improvements of the prework systems 
have been strongly called for. According to a first aspect of the invention there is 
provided sample preparation apparatus comprising: a first 
conveyor for carrying sampler containers; a centrifuge arranged 
to receive the sampler containers from the first conveyor; a 
second conveyor for transporting the sampler containers that have 
undergone a centrifugal separation process in the centrifuge to 
a specimen extraction and delivery device; a plug opening device 
arranged adjacent to the second conveyor; the specimen
