<ABSTRACT>
High molecular weight polyester fibers having 
excellent mechanical strength and useful for various 

industrial materials, is produced by dry-jet wet spinning 
a dope solution of a polyester resin comprising repeating 

ethylene terephthalate units, having an intrinsic 
viscosity of 1.2 or more and dissolved in a phenolic 

solvent, through a spinneret, coagulating the resultant 
filamentary dope solution streams in a bath of 

coagulating liquid in which the phenolic solvent is 
soluble and the polyester resin is insoluble, while 

controlling the temperature of the coagulating liquid to 
a level of from (Tg - 50°C) to (Tg + 45°C) wherein Tg 

represents a glass transition temperature of the dope 
solution, and optionally subjecting the resultant undrawn 

polyester filaments to a rinsing step with a rinsing 
liquid, to a drawing step at a total draw ratio of at 

least 5, and to a heat-treating step.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing high molecular weight polyester fibers. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a process 
for producing polyester fibers with a high molecular 
weight corresponding to an intrinsic viscosity of 1.2 or 
more and having excellent mechanical properties, by a 
dry-jet wet spinning method. It is well known that polyester fibers, 
especially polyethylene terephthalate fibers have well-balanced 
physical and chemical properties and high 
spinning and drawing properties and thus are widely 
useful not only for various cloths but also for 
industrial uses. Particularly, polyester fibers having a 
high tensile strength are useful for various industrial 
materials, for example, tire cords. Usual polyester fibers are produced by a melt-spinning 
(fiber-forming) method which is economically 
advantageous. Accordingly, to produce polyester fibers 
having a high tensile strength and useful for industrial 
materials, generally, a polyester polymer having a high 
degree of polymerization is melt-spun and the resultant 
undrawn filaments are drawn at a high draw ratio. 
However, the polyester polymers which can be formed into 
filaments by the usual melt-spinning method are limited 
to those having a melt viscosity of a certain upper limit 
value or less. Namely, it is difficult to produce 
undrawn polyester filaments substantially capable of 
being drawn from a polyester polymer having an intrinsic 
viscosity of 1.2 or more by the melt-spinning method. 
Therefore, it is very difficult to industrially produce  
 
polyester fibers having a high tensile strength exceeding 
9 g/dtex (10 g/denier) by the melt-spinning method. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publications (Kokai) 
Nos. 61-207,616, 62-30,024 and 4-73,212 disclose methods 
of producing polyester fibers from a polyester resin 
having a high degree of polymerization by dissolving the 
polyester resin in an organic solution and subjecting the 
resultant dope solution to a wet-type or dry-type 
filament-forming procedure. In the methods of Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) Nos. 61-207,616 and 4-73,212, 
dichloroacetic acid and hexafluoropropanol are used as 
solvents for the polyester. The dichloroacetic acid 
exhibits a high degree of acidity and thus there are 
restrictions in handling of the dope solution and in 
types of materials usable for the spinning apparatus. 
Also, the hexafluoropropanol is disadvantageous in high 
price thereof. Therefore, the above-mentioned methods 
are
