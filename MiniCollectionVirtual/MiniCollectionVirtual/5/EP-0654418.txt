<ABSTRACT>
Self-standing pouches are disclosed which are made of a flexible material, which 
comprise a contained goods and which are inflated during manufacture, before 

they are closed. Inflated pouches are thus obtained which are made of a flexible 
material and which are yet substantially more rigid than similar but non-inflated 

pouches. The pouches thus obtained stand upright in a stable manner and are 
less prone to folding. In a preferred embodiment, the pouches herein comprise a 

cut-opening region, and a spontaneous pouring spout is formed as the cut-open 
region is cut off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to doypack-type pouches, i.e. self-standing pouches 
made of flexible material. Doypack-type pouches are well known in the art. These self standing pouches have 
found wide commercial applications because they are environmentally compatible in 
that they generate much less waste material and volume than conventional 
packaging. Indeed, these pouches are made with flexible materials such that the 
pouch can be rolled after it is used, and disposed of in a convenient manner. Most of 
the doypack business thus lies in refill packaging. Another main feature of doypack-type 
pouches is that they comprise a base design such that they are self-standing, 
thus they can be conveniently displayed on shelves, and securely stored in the 
household. To maximize the environmental benefit obtained with doypack-type pouches, it is 
desirable to use materials which are as thin as possible. However, this requirement  
 
is somewhat in contradiction with the requirement that the pouches should be self-standing. 
Indeed, as the material used gets thinner, the pouch tends to fold, 
especially in the headspace region. This is clearly undesirable as folding 
compromises stability of standing, and can even lead, in the worst conditions, to 
cracking of the pouch in the folded region. A possible solution to this problem is the 
elaboration of pouches with sophisticated and specific dimensions or design for a 
given volume. This solution involves a certain amount of research and is therefore 
impractical, expensive and inflexible as different designs are required for different 
volumes. Another problem which is also somewhat linked to the material used, specifically its 
thickness, is that the pouches thus produced may be difficult to open. Indeed, most 
preferred doypack-type pouches have a cut-open region, generally in an upper 
corner. This region must be cut off, and the contained goods can be dispensed from 
that region. However, it often occurs that the side walls of the pouch in the opening 
region remain closely one against the other so that they must be separated before the 
contained goods can be dispensed. This problem is even more acute when thinner 
materials are used and it becomes more difficult to grab one of the side walls only to 
separate it from the other. The present invention solves both these problems at the same time. Indeed, we 
have now found that by inflating a doypack-type pouch before it is closed, an inflated 
pouch is obtained which is less prone to folding and wherein
