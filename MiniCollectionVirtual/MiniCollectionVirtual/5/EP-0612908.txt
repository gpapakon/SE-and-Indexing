<ABSTRACT>
The plug-in weatherstrip seal (12) for windows, doors or facades which are to be glazed from the outside is equipped with sealing lips (13) on the side directed towards the glass pane (5). The plug-in weatherstrip seal is configured such that it can secure the position of the glazing bar (6), which has been inserted into the frame profile, even in a non-glazed frame bay. For this purpose, the plug-in weatherstrip seal (12) is provided with an inner leg (11) and an outer leg (14). The inner leg (11) can be inserted into the gap between the glazing bar (6) and the glass pane (5). The outer side of the glazing bar (6) and part of the adjoining frame profile (9) are covered by the outer leg (14). The outer leg (14) is fastened on the frame profile. The fastening means may be designed as latching means (15) which can spring into an undercut groove of the frame profile and are in one piece with the plug-in weatherstrip. The outer leg (14) covers the joint between the glazing bar and the frame profile and can be fixed on the frame profile with prestressing.
