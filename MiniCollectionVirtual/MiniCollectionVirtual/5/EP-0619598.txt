<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for bonding an
insulator containing no movable ion and a conductor according
to claims 1 and 5.From the document US-A-5 009 690 a generic bonding method is
known in which a first quartz crystal comprising a thin film of
borosilicate glass and a second quartz crystal comprising a
thin film of silicon are juxtaposed in a surface contact
relationship and are then heated to cause the glass and silicon
films being interposed between the first and second quartz
crystals to become electrically conductive. Then, an electrical
potential is applied across the first and second quartz
crystals so as to bond the first and second quartz crystals.In recent years, intensive researches have been
under way with a view to developing such minute
machines as are represented by micromachines,
particularly microactuators. Piezoelectrically
effective ceramics are advantageously used as parts in
these micromachines. Piezoelectrically effective
ceramics, when bonded to an elastic material such as Si
substrates, give rise to such devices as minute
ultrasonic oscillators, ultrasonic sensors, and angular
velocity sensors. Thus, the technique of bonding
ceramics to conductors such as Si substrates is gaining
in importance.Among other known practices adopted for bonding of
ceramics and conductors, the adhesion of ceramics to
conductors through the medium of an adhesive agent
containing a polymer has been much in vogue. The
adhesive agent which contains a polymer, however, has
the disadvantage that when it is used in a minute 
device, it tends to exude from a delimited site of
adhesion. Because of the incorporation of the polymer
therein, this adhesive agent is deficient in resistance
to heat and entails a problem of inability to withstand
high temperatures such as are experienced in the
manufacture of a device using the adhesive agent or in
the actual use of the manufactured device. Further,
since the process of adhesion inevitably necessitates a
step of applying the adhesive agent to a prospective
interface, it is prone to difficulty possibly by
experience in the fixation of a proper site for
application of the adhesive agent.As means for attaining the bonding of ceramics and
conductors without use of an adhesive agent, the method
which comprises providing a thin metallic film between
a Si substrate and a ceramic and fusing the metallic
film at the bonding interface at high temperatures,
thereby joining the Si substrate to the ceramic has
been known. The ceramic in this case, however, has
