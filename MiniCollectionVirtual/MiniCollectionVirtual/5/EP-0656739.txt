<ABSTRACT>
A heating with a thick-layer heating unit (2) has a heating conductor (7) which is connected to a ceramic plate (3) of the heating unit (2) in a thermally conductive manner over the entire surface in such a manner that the thermal flux emanating from the heating resistors (15) reaches those regions (21) of the base plate (3), which are at a distance from the heating resistors (15), by means of the heating conductor (7) faster and more intensely than by means of the base plate (3), so that these regions (21) are heated, in the manner of a thermal-conduction short circuit, without considerable delay and approximately similar to the zones which are heated directly by the heating resistor (15), and harmful thermal tensions in the base plate (3) can therefore be avoided as far as possible. The heating unit (2) is of compact design and can have a very high power density or heating power, can be a ready preassembled construction module having series- and/or parallel-connected individual resistors and can heat, approximately uniformly, considerably larger support surfaces through thermal conduction while having a restricted resistor arrangement.
