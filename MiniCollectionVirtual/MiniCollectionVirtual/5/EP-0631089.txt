Apparatus for removing sludge deposits from the tubes 
and tubesheet of a steam generator, comprising a tubular 

support structure (12) having a first and second ends 
(24, 26) with a securing flange (28) for mounting at an 

access port on the steam generator, said flange extending 
radially from the first end thereof (24), said support 

structure receiving a lance tube (14) having a plurality 
of holes (32) spaced along the length of said tube, a 

spool (16) closely received in said tube (14) for axial 
movement in said tube, said spool having an axial bore 

closed at one end with the central portion of said spool 
being drilled, and connected to a high pressure hose (18) 

which is attached to another end of said spool so as to 
be in fluid communication with the axial bore in said 

spool, said hose extending through the second end of said 
support structure ; and means (20) attached to said 

support structure for causing axial movement of said 
spool and said hose characterized in that the lance tube 

(14) is movable through means (21) for axially adjusting 
its axial position in said support structure (12), said 

lance tube extending beyond the first end of said 
structure. 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
said means (20) for causing axial movement of said spool 

and hose comprises a pinch roller assembly (42, 44) 
mounted on said support structure (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
it further comprises means (22) for causing back and 

forth rotational motion of said lance tube (14) within 
said support structure (12). 
Apparatus according to any of Claims 1-3, 
characterized in that it further comprises means (52) for  

 
determining the axial position of said spool (16) in said 

lance tube (14).
