<ABSTRACT>
A picture display device having a flat vacuum envelope which is provided 
with a transparent face plate with a luminescent screen and with a rear wall, which 

display device has an electron supply section with an electron source for emitting 
electron currents in a direction parallel to the face plate, and an active selection 

electrode section with first, preselection, electrodes and second, fine-selection, 
electrodes, located closer to the screen, for directing each electron current towards 

desired pixels on the luminescent screen. 
The fine-selection electrodes are divided into groups and corresponding 
fine-selection electrodes of at least two groups are interconnected in a series or parallel 

arrangement in such a way that the technology of providing these electrodes is as simple 
as possible and/or the possible fine-selection electrode patterns are such that the number 

of required selection drivers can be reduced considerably.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a picture display device having a flat vacuum 
envelope which is provided with a transparent face plate with a luminescent screen and 
with a rear wall, said display device comprising an electron supply section for emitting 
electron currents, and an active selection electrode section having first, preselection, 
electrodes and second, fine-selection, electrodes, located closer to the screen, for 
directing a plurality of electron currents towards desired positions on the luminescent 
screen. The display device described above may be of the flat-panel type, as 
disclosed in EP-A-464 937, or of another flat-panel type in which electron currents 
parallel to a display screen are emitted and deflected towards predetermined positions on 
the display screen. Display devices of the flat-panel type are devices having a 
transparent face plate and, arranged at a small distance therefrom, a rear plate, in which 
the inner surface of the face plate is provided with a (for example, hexagonal) pattern of 
phosphor dots. If (video information-controlled) electrons impinge upon the luminescent 
screen, a visual image is formed which is visible via the front side of the face plate. 
The face plate may be flat or, if desired, curved (for example, spherical or cylindrical). The display device disclosed in EP-A-464 937 comprises a plurality of 
juxtaposed sources for emitting electrons, local electron propagation means cooperating 
with the sources and each having walls of a high-ohmic, electrically substantially 
insulating material having a secondary emission coefficient suitable for propagating 
emitted electrons along the wall, and an addressing means comprising an active 
selection electrode section having (first) electrodes (preselection electrodes) which can 
be driven row by row so as to extract electrons from the propagation means at 
predetermined extraction locations facing the luminescent screen, further means being 
provided for directing extracted electrons towards pixels of the luminescent screen for 
producing a picture composed of pixels. It is known from EP-A-464 937 to arrange an apertured fine-selection 
plate, whose apertures are addressable by means of second, or fine-selection electrodes  
 
between the first electrodes and the screen. The arrangement is such that each extraction 
location of the addressing means is associated with at least two apertures in the fine-selection 
plate. The selection electrode section is thus of the multi-stage (in this case 
two-stage) type.
