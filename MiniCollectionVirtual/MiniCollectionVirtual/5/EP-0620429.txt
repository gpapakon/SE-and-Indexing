<ABSTRACT>
A prism (3) is provided with an emitting surface (3a) which outputs fluorescence as a light signal transmitted through a 
slab waveguide (1) constituting one face of a reaction bath. An auxiliary inclined surface (3b) continuing the emitting surface (3a) 

and having an inclination opposite to the emitting surface (3a) is formed on the prism (3). The stray light of the fluorescence is 
emitted from the auxiliary surface (3b), and is prevented from entering a detector (7) which detects the fluorescence as a light signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical measurement 
apparatus. More particularly, this invention relates to 
an optical measurement apparatus in which a reaction 
vessel is formed on a surface at one side of a slab-type 
optical waveguide, a measurement light is introduced in 
the slab-type optical waveguide through a prism, and a 
signal light is outgone through the slab-type optical 
waveguide and the prism, the signal light depending upon 
optical characteristics of vicinity of the surface at 
one side of the slab-type optical waveguide. From the past, an optical measurement method is 
known in which a slab-type optical waveguide is 
employed, only labeled fluorescent substance existing in 
vicinity of a surface of the slab-type optical waveguide  
 
is excited by evanescent wave component scarcely 
penetrating from the slab-type optical waveguide, and 
existence or non-existence of immunoreaction, or degree 
of immunoreaction is measured based upon the excited 
fluorescent light. To actualize the method, an 
apparatus which is shown in Fig. 10 is proposed (refer 
to Swiss Patent Specification No.2799/85-2, and an 
official gazette of Tokukaisho No.63-273040). In the 
apparatus, a reaction vessel 92 is formed in one body on 
one face of a slab-type optical waveguide 91 which has a 
prism at an edge portion for light introduction, an 
exciting light outgone from a laser light source and the 
like, which is not shown, is introduced in the slab-type 
optical waveguide 91 through a dichroic mirror 93, 
fluorescent light radiated from labeled fluorescent 
substance is outgone through the slab-type optical 
waveguide 11, the outgone fluorescent light is separated 
from an exciting light path by the dichroic mirror 93, 
and the outgone fluorescent light is incident on an 
optical detector 95 through an optical filter 94. When the above-mentioned arrangement is 
employed, for example, antibodies 96 are previously 
immobilized to the surface of the slab-type optical 
waveguide 91, antigens 97 in a test liquid are received 
by the antibodies 96, fluorescent labeled antibodies 98  
 
which are formed by labeling antibodies with fluorescent 
substance, is further received by the received antigens 
97. That is, quantity of the received fluorescent 
labeled antibodies 98 is determined based upon quantity 
of the antigens 97 in the test liquid. And, only the 
label fluorescent substance 98a of the received 
fluorescnent labeled antibodies 98 are excited so as to 
generate fluorescnent light by evanescent wave
