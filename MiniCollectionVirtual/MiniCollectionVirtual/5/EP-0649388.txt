<ABSTRACT>
A method of making metal oxide clusters in a single stage by reacting a metal oxide with a substoichiometric amount of an acid in the presence of an oxide particle growth terminator and solubilizer. A method of making a ceramer is also disclosed in which the metal oxide clusters are reacted with a functionalized polymer. The resultant metal oxide clusters and ceramers are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made under contract No.
NAG-9-229 with the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration Association (NASA).The present invention relates
to the
methods of making a metal oxide cluster and a method of making a ceramer.Polymer-ceramic composites or ceramers have the
potential to combine the properties of polymers and
ceramics, particularly oxides, in useful ways. of
special use are the so-called nanocomposites which
consist of alloys of polymers with ceramic particles
of diameter much smaller than the wavelength of
visible light. High refractive index, scratch and
corrosion-resistant optical coatings and radiation-resistant
coatings are such applications.These inorganic/organic hybrid materials have
been prepared by:
1) reacting an oligomer functionalized by a
trialkoxysilane with a metal alkoxide and a
water-generating source in a single step to
make a "ceramer";2) prereacting an organofunctionalized (epoxy,
alkenes, etc.) trialkoxysilane with a metal
alkoxide and a water-generating source to
generate an "ormocer" in the first step and
then fusing these organocoated inorganic oxide
clusters into a solid body by polymerization of
the organic groups in the second step; 3) swelling a metal alkoxide into a preformed
elastomer and subsequently hydrolyzing the
alkoxide to oxide; and4) preparation of a highly porous xerogel by
hydrolysis of dilute metal alkoxides and
subsequent infiltration and polymerization of
^monomer in the pores. Methods 1, 2, 3 have so far been used only for
thin film coatings since a large surface must be
available, permitting small molecule condensation
products to evaporate during alkoxide hydrolysis and
self-condensation into the oxide. Method 2 is an
extension of Method 1 since an oxide cluster is also
surface functionalized by an organic functional
group. However, in Method 2, the small molecule
condensation products are completely removed from
the cluster in a separate step prior to fabrication.Recently the detailed structure of soluble
alkoxide coated titanium oxide and trialkyl siloxane
coated, hydroxy aluminum hydroxide ormocers have
been elucidated. All useful ormocer materials are
soluble in organic solvents and can be cast into
films.In an especially useful application of ormocer
materials, oxide clusters coated with
photopolymerizable groups have been fabricated into
high refractive index, optical waveguides by
photolithography.In all applications so far the ormocers have
been first solvated and solvent cast. In principal,
compression molding of the
