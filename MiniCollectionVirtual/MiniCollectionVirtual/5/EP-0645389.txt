<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for the preparation of imidazopyridines of the general formula 
<
IMAGE
>
 wherein the radicals R1 to R4 have the meaning indicated in the description, is described. In the key step of the process an alkoxyimidate of the formula 
<

A process for the preparation of imidazopyridine derivatives of 
the general formula 


 
wherein 


R
1
is an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl group or 
is a heterocyclic radical, 
R
2
 and R
4
are identical or different and are hydrogen, a 
hydroxy, cyano, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl or aralkyl 

group or are an alkanoyl or an alkoxy-carbonyl 
group, and 
R
3
is hydrogen, an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group or a 
halogen atom, characterized in that an alkoxy 

imidate of the general formula 
 
wherein R
1
 is as defined above and R
5
 is alkyl, aryl or aralkyl, 
is cyclized with aminoacetonitrile and a 1,3-dicarbonyl 

compound of the general formula 

 
wherein R
3
 is as defined above, and R
6
 and R
7
 are identical or 
different and are hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkoxy or 

alkoxycarbonyl, to give the final product of the general 
formula I.  

 
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
aminoacetonitrile is liberated from a salt of aminoacetonitrile 

by means of a base. 
The process according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the cyclization is carried out at a temperature between room 

temperature and the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture, 
and is optionally conducted in the presence of an additional 

solvent. 
The process according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
alkoxy imidate of the general formula II is obtained by 

reaction of a nitrile of the general formula 

R
1
CN
 
wherein R
1
 is as defined above, with an alcohol of the general 
formula 


R
5
OH
 
wherein R
5
 is as defined above, in the presence of a hydrogen 
halide.
