<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel sulfur-containing,
phosphonate compounds, including bisphosphonates,
phosphonoalkylphosphinates, phosphonocarboxylates, and
phosphonosulfonates. This invention further relates to
pharmaceutical compositions containing these novel compounds, as
well as to a method of treating or preventing certain metabolic
bone disorders characterized by abnormal calcium and phosphate
metabolism, utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of
the present invention. In addition, this invention relates to a
method of osteoprotective treatment or prevention of arthritis,
especially rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, utilizing
various compounds disclosed herein. Specifically, this invention
relates to a method of treating or preventing osteoporosis and
arthritis, especially rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, by
utilizing a compound or pharmaceutical composition of the present
invention.A number of pathological conditions which can afflict warm-blooded
animals involves abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism.
Such conditions may be divided into two broad categories.
1. Conditions which are characterized by anomalous
mobilization of calcium and phosphate leading to general or
specific bone loss, such as osteoporosis and Paget's
disease; or excessively high calcium and phosphate levels in 
the fluids of the body, such as hypercalcemia of malignancy.
Such conditions are sometimes referred to herein as
pathological hard tissue demineralizations.2. Conditions which cause or result from deposition of
calcium, and phosphate anomalously in the body, such as
rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. These conditions
are sometimes referred to herein as pathological
calcifications.The first category included the most common metabolic bone
disorder, osteoporosis; osteoporosis is a condition in which bone
hard tissue is lost disproportionately to the development of new
hard tissue. Osteoporosis can be generally defined as the
reduction in the quantity of bone, or the atrophy of skeletal
tissue. Marrow and bone spaces become larger, fibrous binding
decreases, and compact bone becomes fragile. Osteoporosis can be
subclassified as menopausal, senile, drug-induced (e.g. adrenocorticoid,
as can occur in steroid therapy); disease-induced
(arthritic and tumor), etc.; however, the manifestations are
essentially the same. In general, there are two types of
osteoporosis: primary and secondary. "Secondary osteoporosis"
is the result of a separate identifiable disease process or
agent. However,
