<ABSTRACT>
The present invention pertains to an apparatus and method 
useful in semiconductor processing. The apparatus and 

method can be used to provide a seal which enables a first 
portion of a semiconductor processing chamber to be 

operated at a first pressure while a second portion of the 
semiconductor processing chamber is operated at a second, 

different pressure. The sealing apparatus and method enable 
processing of a semiconductor substrate (104) under a 

partial vacuum which renders conductive/convective heat 

transfer impractical, while at least a portion of the 
substrate support platform (106) is under a pressure 

adequate to permit heat transfer using a 
conductive/convective heat transfer means. The sealing 

apparatus (140) comprises a thin, metal-comprising layer 
(202), typically in the form of a strip or band, brazed to 

at least two different surfaces within said processing 
chamber, whereby the first and second portions of the 

semiconductor processing chamber are pressure isolated from 
each other. Preferably, the metal-comprising layer (202) 

exhibits a cross-sectional thickness of less than about 
0.039 in. (1 mm). The invention is particularly useful when 

there is a differential in linear expansion coefficient of 
at least 3 x 10⁻³ in./in./°C (m/m/°C), measured at 600°C, 

between the surfaces to be bridged by the thin, metal-comprising 
layer (202).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method which can be used to 
provide a seal between two portions of a semiconductor processing reactor which are 
operated at different pressures. The apparatus and method are particularly useful when 
the processing reactor operates over a broad temperature range (about 600°C) and the 
seal must bridge two materials having a substantially different coefficient of expansion. In the fabrication of electronic components such as semiconductor devices, the 
manufacturing process frequently requires that a substrate be cooled while that substrate 
is exposed to a partial pressure of about 10-3 Torr or lower. Processes which require 
substrate cooling under such partial vacuum conditions include, for example, physical 
vapor deposition (PVD), ion injection and particular forms of plasma etching. PVD is used to deposit a thin film on a substrate. Films of materials such as, for 
example, aluminum, titanium, tungsten, tantalum, tantalum nitride, cobalt, and silica may 
be deposited on ceramic, glass or silicon-derived substrates using PVD processes such 
as a sputtering process. In a typical sputtering process, a low pressure atmosphere of an 
ionizable gas such as argon or helium is produced in a vacuum chamber. The pressure 
in the vacuum chamber is reduced to about 1,3 x 10-6 - 1,3 x 10-10 mbar (10-6 to 10-10) Torr, after which argon, for 
example, is introduced to produce an argon partial pressure ranging between about 
0.13 µbar (0.1 mTorr) and about 0,026 mbar (20 mTorr). Two electrodes, a cathode 
and an anode, are generally disposed in the vacuum chamber. The cathode is typically 
made of the material to be deposited or sputtered, and the anode is generally formed by 
the enclosure (particular walls of the vacuum chamber, or the platform upon which the 
substrate sits, for example). At times, an auxiliary anode may be used or the article to 
be coated may serve as the anode. A high voltage is applied between these two 
electrodes, and the substrate to be coated is disposed upon a platform positioned opposite 
the cathode. The platform upon which the substrate sets is often heated and/or cooled,  
 
and heat is transferred between the platform and the substrate, to assist in obtaining a 
smooth, even thin film coating upon the substrate. To obtain a smooth, even film 
coating, it is desirable to maintain the substrate at a uniform temperature within a few 
°C; preferably, the temperature is near but below the melting point of the material from 
which the
