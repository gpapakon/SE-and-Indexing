<ABSTRACT>
Cloned recombinant or synthetic DNA sequences related to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease are injected into fertilized mammalian eggs (preferably mice eggs). The injected eggs are implanted in pseudo pregnant females and are grown to term to provide transgenic mice whose cells express proteins related to the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The injected sequences are constructed having promoter sequences connected so as to express the desired protein in specific tissues of the transgenic mammal (most notably in nerve tissue). The proteins which are preferably ubiquitously expressed include (1)  beta -amyloid core precursor proteins; and (2)  beta -amyloid related precursor proteins; and (3) serine protease inhibitor. The transgenic mice provide useful models for studying compounds being tested for their usefulness in treating Alzheimer's disease, and for studying the in vivo interrelationships of these proteins to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to animal
models useful in testing a hypothesis related to the
treatment of a disease. More specifically, it relates to
transgenic mammals which have had incorporated in their
genome specific segments of exogenous genetic material
which encode for and in specific cell types will
ubiquitously over-express b-amyloid proteins, their
precursors and portions of such proteins and precursors.The background of the present invention is
twofold in that it relates to: (1) biological organisms
which have been genetically transformed; and (2) a study
of genetic material related to amyloidosis.
Both of these areas are discussed below.For sometime it has been known that it is
possible to carry out the genetic transformation of a 
zygote (and the embryo and mature organism which result
therefrom) by the placing or insertion of exogenous
genetic material into the nucleus of the zygote or to any
nucleic genetic material which ultimately forms a part of
the nucleus of the zygote. The genotype of the zygote
and the organism which results from a zygote will include
the genotype of the exogenous genetic material.
Additionally, the inclusion of exogenous genetic material
in the zygote will result in a phenotype expression of
the exogenous genetic material.The genotype of the exogenous genetic material
is expressed upon the cellular division of the zygote.
However, the phenotype expression, e.g., the production
of a protein product or products of the exogenous genetic
material, or alterations of the zygote's or organism's
natural phenotype, will occur at that point of the
zygote's or organism's development during which the
particular exogenous genetic material is active.
Alterations of the expression of the phenotype include an
enhancement or diminution in the expression of a
phenotype or an alteration in the promotion and/or
control of a phenotype, including the addition of a new
promoter and/or controller or supplementation of an
existing promoter and/or controller of the phenotype.The genetic transformation of various types of
organisms is disclosed and described in detail in U.S.
patent 4,873,191, issued October 10, 1989, which is
incorporated herein by reference to disclose methods of
producing transgenic organisms. The genetic
transformation of organisms can be used as an in vivo
analysis of gene expression during differentiation and in
the elimination or diminution of genetic diseases.The genetic transformation of a zygote (and the
organisms which matures therefrom) is carried out by the

<CLAIMS>
A transgenic non-human mammal whose cells contain the cloned
recombinant or synthetic DNA sequence which sequence comprises:


a nerve tissue specific promoter sequence which is neuronal specific
enolase promoter; and
a coding sequence which encodes A751 β-amyloid precursor protein
and wherein the promoter and the coding sequence are operatively associated

with each other, are stably incorporated into the genome of the non-human mammal
and are expressed to form β-amyloid protein deposits in the brain of the non-human

mammal.
A mammal according to claim 1 which is a mouse.
A method of producing a genetically transformed non-human zygote capable of
developing into a transgenic non-human mammal 
characterised
 as having a plurality
of cells containing a cloned recombinant or synthetic DNA sequence, the sequence

comprising:

a nerve tissue specific promoter sequence which is neuronal specific
enolase promoter operably associated with a coding sequence which encodes A751

β-amyloid precursor protein which method comprises the step of:

introducing the promoter sequence and the coding sequence into a
pronucleus of a mammalian zygote by microinjection, said zygote being capable of

development into a mammal, thereby obtaining a genetically transformed zygote;
where said promoter sequence and coding sequence are selected so
that the coding sequence is not activated in such manner and degree as would prevent

normal development of the embryo to term; and

   wherein the β-amyloid precursor protein is expressed to form β-amyloid
protein deposits in the brain of the non-human mammal. 
A method according to claim 3 in which at least about 1,000 copies of
the gene are microinjected into the pronucleus and the volume of genetic material

injected does not exceed about 10 picoliters.
A method according to claim 3 or 4 in which the promoter sequence
and coding sequence are introduced into the male pronucleus of an egg having

separate female and male pronuclei.
A method according to any one of claims 3, 4 or 5 in which the zygote
is allowed to develop 
in vitro
 to the morula or blastocyst stage.
