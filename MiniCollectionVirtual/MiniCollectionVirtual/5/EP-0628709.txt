<ABSTRACT>
In an internal combustion engine comprising an engine block 
(1) housing at least one reciprocating piston (2) being 

provided in a cylinder comprising at least one inlet valve 
(7) and an exhaust valve (8), which piston (2) is coupled 

with a crankshaft (3) being coupled with a drive and/or 
working shaft (4, 5), there is at least one two-sided piston 

(2) reciprocating in two coaxial chambers (I,II) each of a 
cylinder. Each chamber (I, II) is provided on opposite sides 

of the crankshaft (3), wherein the at least one two-sided 
piston (2) comprises a central bearing, through which the 

crankshaft (3) is passing, and wherein the drive and/or 
working shaft (4, 5) is coupled eccentrically with the 

crankshaft (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion 
engine comprising an engine block housing at least one two-sided 
piston reciprocating in a cylinder, two coaxial 
chambers formed in said cylinder on opposite sides of said 
two-sided piston, both chambers having at least one inlet 
valve and at least one exhaust valve, whereby said two-sided 
piston comprises a central bearing defined by an opening in 
the midpoint between the two sides of said two-sided piston 
through which a crank pin of a crankshaft is passing and 
whereby eccentric journals of said crankshaft are in turn 
mounted in an eccentric bearing of a drive and/or working 
shaft, the eccentricity of said bearing with respect to the 
axis of the drive and/or working shaft being the same as the 
eccentricity of said eccentric journals of said crankshaft. Branches of technology that the invention refers to: 
Automobile/Car Industry Aviation Shipbuilding Stationary drive of generators, compressors, etc. Compressors Most existent internal combustion engines operate as single-acting 
engines, which means that the working substance or 
fuel is supplied to the cylinder only from one side, while 
the kinetic energy is transmitted from the piston further 
through the piston rod to the crankshaft also only from one 
side. Such known internal combustion engines, therefore, 
comprise a plurality of parts of which a great percentage is 
movable so that there exists a great wear on these numerous 
components. Internal combustion engines according to the above-mentioned 
type, wherein at least one two-sided piston is reciprocating 
in two coaxial chambers of a cylinder are known from FR-A-971 
415 which represents the closest state of the art and from NL-A-9 000 464, for example. With these  
 
known constructions there may exist however problems when 
starting the engine. It is therefore an object of the present invention to simplify 
the mode of transformation of the translational motion 
of the two-sided piston into the rotational motion of the 
crankshaft of an internal combustion engine and to guarantee 
that an eventual dead-center position of the crankshaft will 
not hinder the start of the engine. For solving these problems there is provided an internal 
combustion engine comprising an engine block housing at 
least one two-sided piston reciprocating in a cylinder, two 
coaxial chambers formed in said cylinder on opposite sides 
of said two-sided piston, both chambers having at least one 
inlet valve and at least one exhaust valve, whereby
