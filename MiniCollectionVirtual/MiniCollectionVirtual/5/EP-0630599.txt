<ABSTRACT>
Armchair body, advantageously of an office armchair, which 
can be dismantled and comprises a seat and a seatback 

connected together without a gap, two arms shaped as an 
overturned "L" being associated with the seat and seatback 

respectively at the two sides of the same, cushions (24) 
forming a continuous surface being able to be applied to the 

seat and seatback and being replaceable, the body consisting 
of a first one-piece unit (11) made of a rigid plastic 

material and comprising in one single finished assembly the 
seat (12), which includes in superelevation at its rear the 

base of the seatback (13) and, at its sides, two opposed 
arms (14), the body consisting also of a second one-piece 

unit (17) which is associated replaceably with the upper 
part of the base of the seatback (13) and comprises at its 

two sides retaining wing means (28), the base of the 
seatback (13) and the arms (14) defining at their upper side 

substantially one single surface substantially parallel to 
the lower plane of the first unit (11), the surface defined 

by the seatback (13) and arms (14) containing in its rear 
portion integral female alignment and anchorage means (16a) 

cooperating with mating male alignment and anchorage means 
(18) included as an integral part of the lower portion of 

the second unit (17), the front side of the base of the 
seatback (13) of the first unit (11) and the front side of 

the second unit (17) creating at least one substantially 
vertical continuous region without unevenesses when fitted 

together, at least the first unit (11) comprising 
reinforcement means (15) extending along at least part of 

its perimeter, the seat (12) of the first unit (11) 
including on its lower side in a substantially central 

position at least one zone (22) of an increased thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an office armchair body which can 
be dismantled, as set forth in the main claim. The office armchair body which can be dismantled is 
applied advantageously to the provision of office armchairs 
and, in particular, to office armchairs with stationary 
lateral arms and with a seatback of a low or high type, that 
it to say, a type for visitors and a type for managers. The body which can be dismantled according to the 
invention is employed for the provision of armchairs in 
which the seatback and seat are fixed to each other and 
cannot be adjusted in relation to each other. The body which can be dismantled according to the 
invention can be used to make armchairs provided with known 
systems for adjusting the height of the seat and for 
oscillatory adjustment, which enables the inclination of the 
body to be adjusted in two or more different positions. The body according to the invention can be employed 
equally well in rotatable arm chairs possibly equipped with 
casters at their lower end and in stationary armchairs. Office armchairs with a high or low seatback and lateral 
arms are well known. These armchairs have a body which 
forms the seatback and seat and is normally made of bent 
lamellar wood. This body is generally upholstered and includes cushions 
to sit on and rest against, which are made of soft foam 
material such as foam rubber, for instance, covered with a 
finishing material such as leather, leathercloth, artificial 
leather or a woven fabric. One of the greatest problems linked to this type of 
armchair is due to the tearing or breaking of the covering 
material, above all at the points where the material is  
 
folded or at the rear of the seatback. In fact, it often happens that the armchair is scraped 
against the desk or that some jutting object comes into 
contact with the rear of the seatback and thus spoils the 
armchair to the extent of making necessary the replacement 
of a part or of the upholstery of the damaged part with 
great annoyance and high costs for its user. Next, this type of armchair includes arms, which are 
advantageously L-shaped and are secured to the body with 
screws partly in the seat and partly in the seatback zone. Suitable upholstered cushions are then applied, fixedly or 
removably to the body thus covered, on the seat and on the 
seatback. This type of armchair is widely used nowadays, and a 
plurality of manufacturers are competing on the market and 
have reached the limit of their ability in seeking a 
reduction in their
