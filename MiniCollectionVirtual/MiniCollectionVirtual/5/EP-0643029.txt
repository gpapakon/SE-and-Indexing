<ABSTRACT>
Aromatic byproducts normally formed in the dehydrogenation of normal 
paraffins to linear monoolefins have been found to be detrimental in the usual 

processes of aromatic alkylation using the dehydrogenation product mixture as an 
alkylation feedstock. In particular, when solids are used as the alkylation catalysts 

with recycle of the unreacted feedstock to the dehydrogenation reactor the aromatic 
byproducts increase to a level where they exert a significant decrease in the stability 

of the alkylation catalyst. When the aromatic byproducts are removed in whole or 
in part alkylation may be performed at a substantially lower temperature, which 

affords alkylated aromatics whose alkyl portion has greater linearity than that 
observed at a higher alkylation temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
Over fifty years ago it was recognized that alkylbenzene sulfonates (ABS) 
were quite effective detergents superior to natural soaps in many respects. Because 
of their lower price, their price stability, and their effectiveness in a wide range of 
detergent formulations, ABS rapidly displaced soaps in household laundry and 
dishwashing applications and became the standard surfactants for the detergent 
industry. The alkylbenzene sulfonates had substantial branching in the alkyl chain 
until the early 1960's when it became apparent that these detergents were 
contributing to the pollution of lakes and streams and forming relatively stable 
foams. Examination of the problem showed that alkyl chains with a branched 
structure were not susceptible to rapid biodegradation and the surfactant properties 
of the detergent thus persisted for long periods of time. This was contrary to the 
earlier situation when natural soaps were used because the linear alkyl chains in 
natural soaps underwent rapid biodegradation. After recognizing the biodegradability of ABS based on alkylation by linear 
olefins, industry turned its attention to the production of these unbranched olefins 
and their subsequent use in the production of linear alkylbenzenes. Processes were 
developed for efficient alkylation of benzene by available feedstocks containing 
linear olefins, and the production of linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) became another 
reliable process broadly available to the petroleum and petrochemical industry. It 
gradually evolved that HF-catalyzed alkylation was particularly effective in LAB 
production, and an HF-based alkylation process became the industry standard. Alkylation typically is performed using an excess of benzene relative to 
olefins. The ideal process would afford 100% conversion of olefins using an  
 
equimolar proportion of benzene and olefins, but since this is not attained one 
strives for maximum olefin conversion using a benzene to olefin molar ratio up to 
30. The better the process, the lower will be the benzene:olefin ratio at a high 
conversion of, say, 98%. The degree of conversion at a constant value of 
benzene-olefin ratio is a measure of catalytic activity (subject to the caveat that the 
ratio must not be so high that the degree of conversion is invariant to small changes 
in this ratio). The degree of conversion may be expressed by the formula, 
V = CT X 100,  
where Vequalspercent conversion, C equals moles of olefin consumed, and T equals 
moles olefin initially present.

<CLAIMS>
In a process of continuously alkylating in an alkylation step an aromatic 
compound in the presence of an alkylation catalyst with at least one linear olefin 

present in an alkylation feedstock which is produced in a dehydrogenation step by 
dehydrogenation of at least one linear paraffin having from 6 up to 20 carbon 

atoms, said alkylation feedstock also containing one or more unreacted linear 
paraffins and more than 2 weight percent accumulated aromatic byproducts formed 

in the dehydrogenation step, the improvement comprising reducing the 
concentration of the aromatic byproducts in said alkylation feedstock to a level no 

more than 2 weight percent prior to the passage of said feedstock to the alkylation 
step. 
The process of Claim 1 where the concentration of aromatic byproducts in 
said alkylation feedstock is reduced to less than 0.5 weight percent. 
The process of Claim 1 or 2 where the alkylation feedstock is made by the 
dehydrogenation of at least one linear paraffin having from 10 up to 14 carbon 

atoms. 
The process of Claim 1, 2 or 3 where the alkylation catalyst is a solid 
alkylation catalyst. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 4 where the concentration of aromatic 
byproducts in the alkylation feedstock is reduced by a solid adsorption process. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 4 where the concentration of aromatic 
byproducts in the alkylation feedstock is reduced by a liquid-liquid extraction 

process. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 6 where the effluent from the 
alkylation step is separated into an alkylaromatic fraction and an unreacted normal 

paraffin fraction and where at least a portion of the unreacted normal paraffin 
fraction is recycled to the dehydrogenation step. 
The process of any one of Claims 1 to 7 where the temperature used in the 
alkylation step is reduced to a level which affords greater linearity in the 

alkylaromatic product.
