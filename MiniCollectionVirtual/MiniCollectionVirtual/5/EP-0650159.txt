<ABSTRACT>
In a manufacturing method of a magnetic recording 
medium with a vacuum deposition, two shielding members are 

provided above a substrate for defining an aperture. An 
evaporation source is located at a position wherein evaporated 

atoms from an evaporation material can adhere to a moving 
substrate through the aperture. The substrate is moved while 

a material in the evaporation source is irradiated at two 
evaporation portions with two electron beams along a moving 

direction of the substrate to form a magnetic layer. Thus, 
curving of columnar grains formed in the magnetic layer is 

suppressed or crystal orientation is enhanced, and magnetic 
read/write characteristics are improved. Further, a productivity 

is improved because the aperture can be enlarged than 
previously by using the two evaporation portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing
method of a thin film magnetic recording medium.A magnetic recording apparatus has been developed
to deal with a higher recording density, and a magnetic
recording medium superior in read/write characteristics at
short wavelengths is demanded. At present, magnetic recording
media used mainly are prepared by coating magnetic powders to
a substrate, and characteristics of the magnetic media are
improved to satisfy the above-mentioned demand. However, the
improvement comes near limits on magnetic recording media
prepared by coating magnetic powders to a substrate.A thin film magnetic recording medium has been developed
to exceed the limits. Such a thin film magnetic recording medium
is prepared by vacuum deposition, sputtering, plating or the
like, and it has superior read/write characteristics at short
wavelengths. Materials such as Co, Co-Ni, Co-Ni-P, Co-O, Co-Ni-O,
Co-Fe-O, Co-Ni-Fe-O, Co-Cr, Co-Ni-Cr and the like are
tried for a magnetic layer in thin film magnetic recording
media. As a material for a magnetic tape, a Co-O film and a 
Co-Ni-O film as a partially oxidized film are considered to
be most suitable, and a deposition tape including a magnetic
layer made of Co-Ni-O is already available commercially.Examples of prior art manufacturing methods of
deposition tapes are explained below with reference to Figs.
1 and 2. Fig. 1 shows an example of a continuous vacuum
deposition apparatus for manufacturing a thin film magnetic
recording tape. Evaporated atoms adhere obliquely to a
substrate running on a cylindrical drum to form a magnetic
layer. A substrate 100 made of a polymer material runs along
a cylindrical drum 200 in a direction denoted with an arrow
101. Reference numerals 210 and 211 denote a supply roll and
a winding roll for the substrate 100. Atoms evaporated from
an evaporation source 20 adhere to the substrate to form a
magnetic layer. An electron beam evaporation source is
preferable for the evaporation source 20, and for example a
Co-based alloy as an evaporation material 30 is filled
therein. An electron beam evaporation source is used for
evaporation of materials such as Co having a high melting point
at a high evaporation rate. Reference numeral 10 denotes an
electron beam shown schematically as an arrow. A
material such as Co having a high melting point evaporates
only at a position where the electron beam 10 impringes, and
it hardly evaporates outside such a position. Shielding plates
