<ABSTRACT>
An impulse wrench comprises a pneumatic rotation motor 
(12), a hydraulic torque impulse generator (13) provided 

with an impulse magnitude responsive actuating means 
(17), a linear movement responsive electric signal 

producing means (25) located at the rear end of the motor 
(12), a movement transferring push rod (21) extending 

through an axial bore (22) in the motor rotor (16) and 
interconnecting the actuating means (17) and the signal 

producing means (25), an electrically activated motive 
air shut-off valve (31) disposed concentrically with said 

signal producing means (25), and an external process 
controlling and monitoring unit (40) connected to the 

signal producing means (25) and the shut-off valve (31) 
and arranged to compute and compare received signals with 

predetermined values and to initiate shut-off of the 
power supply means (31) as a desired tightening condition 

is reached.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an impulse wrench
having a pneumatic rotation motor with a rotor, power
supply means for connecting the motor to a pressure air
source, a hydraulic torque impulse generator which is
drivingly coupled to the forward end of the motor, and an
output shaft for delivering torque impulses to screw
joints to be tightened.A problem concerned with this type of tools is the
difficulty to monitor and control the tightening
processes in an accurate and reliable way. The reason is
that it is difficult to obtain a reliable torque impulse
reflecting signal from the impulse delivering tool.One known way of solving this problem is to use a contact
free torque detecting means at the output spindle of the
wrench, as described in EP 0 502 748. This known device
comprises a specially designed output spindle which at
least partly is made of a magnetostrictive material, and
a pair of coils surrounding the spindle for detecting
torque related distortion of the spindle.This known torque impulse detecting means requires a
modified impulse mechanism with a longer output spindle
and an enlarged housing diameter.As described in two German scientific studies, namely
"Diplomarbeit im Fach Steurungs- und Regelungstechnik"
from February 1992 and July 1992, the torque impulse
detecting problem is solved by a means which does not
require any modification of the impulse mechanism itself,
but is easily adaptable to impulse wrench designs 
including impulse magnitude responsive shut-off means.
Prior art impulse wrench designs suitable for this
previously described technique are disclosed in for
instance EP 0 441 758 and US 4,418,764.According to the abovementioned German studies, a torque
impulse reflecting signal is obtained by an inductive
displacement detecting device (LVDT= Linear Variable
Differential Transformer) coupled to the coaxially
extending actuating rod and being located at the rear end
of the motor. The impulse wrenches used for these studies
are of the type having a mechanical retardation
responsive means connected to the impulse generator for
obtaining a linear signal generating movement. This means
that the signal obtained is an indirect reflection of the
torque impulse character, since it is the retardation
characteristics of the impulse generator that are
actually measured. However, this signal reflects
accurately enough the impulse characteristics and is used
in a process monitoring and control unit to calculate
tightening data of interest, like the shut-off point.Tightening shut-off is
