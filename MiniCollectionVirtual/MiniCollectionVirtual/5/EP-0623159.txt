<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to anti-corrosive paints
for metals. More particularly, this relates to paints
containing conjugated polymers as corrosion preventive
agents.Corrosion inhibiting primers for metals such as
steel are known. Various mentions have been made of
the possible use of conductive conjugated polymers as
corrosion inhibitors. See for example, (F.L. Jain et
al. "Corrosion Prevention in Metals using Layered
Semiconductor/Insulator Structures Forming an
Interfacial Electronic Barrier" in Adhesives, Sealants,
and Coatings for Harsh Space Environments, Polym. Sci.
and Tech., Vol. 37, PP. 381-404, (Plenum, 1988); L.E.A.
Berlouis and D.J. Schiffrin, "Recent Advances in
Electrochemical Polymerization for Surface Coating",
Trans IMF, Vol 64, p42 (1986) and "Anodic Synthesis of
Polyaniline Coating Onto Fe Sheets", G. Mengoli, et
al., J.Appl.Polym Sci., 26, 4247 (1981); PCT
88/00798; and "Conductive Organic Polymers as Corrosion
Control Coatings", NASA Technical Memorandum 103811,
pp. 3-5, (1990).Blends of polyaniline and one or more
thermosetting and thermoplastic resins are known. See
for example, PCT-WO 89/01694 and PCT-WO 90/10297. WO 89/02155 describes intrinsically conductive polymers in the form of
dispersible solids and indicates that they can be used inter alia for corrosion
protection.The polymers described in WO 89/02155 have (poly)conjugated Ï€-electron systems, and a
variety of such polymers are mentioned in WO 89/02155, including polyanilines. Intrinsic
conductivity is generally defined in WO 89/02155 as meaning a conductivity of more than 1
S/cm.The present invention provides an improved anti-corrosive paint of the type
comprising one or more polymeric binders dispersed in a liquid medium.According to the invention, the paint is provided with anti-corrosion properties
by including one or more neutral conjugated homopolymers or
copolymers in an amount from 2 to 20% by weight of the dried paint, said
amount being such that the electrical conductivity of the dried paint is less
than 10-9 S/cm, as measured by the four-in-line probe
method. The paints of this invention exhibit several
unique properties which make these paints suitable for
protection against corrosion. For example, the
materials have good adhesion and relatively low to
moderate cost. Moreover, while the dispersion of the
conductive polymer in the paint may not provide a
continuous coating phase of electrically conductive
polymer, corrosion inhibition is surprisingly observed.
Furthermore, this corrosion inhibition is observed
