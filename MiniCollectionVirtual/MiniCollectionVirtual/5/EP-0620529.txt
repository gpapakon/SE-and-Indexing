<ABSTRACT>
A montage image creating apparatus which selectively 
designates one of the patterns of each of a plurality of 

parts which constitutes a face, and combines the respective 
designated part patterns into a montage image. It 

selectively designates a pattern of at least one of a 
plurality of parts on the basis of a character designated 

by a character designating unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electronic montage 
creation devices which create the image of a face. Conventionally, small portable electronic devices have 
been sold as articles which are typified by electronic 
notebooks which, for example, store data on input names, 
addresses, telephone numbers beforehand and display such 
data, as required. Such device is capable of storing and displaying only 
data on letters and numerals and cannot sometimes remind us 
of a person's figure (especially, his face) from displayed 
data. It could be conceived to beforehand store data on 
persons's names, addresses, and telephone numbers along 
with data on their images obtained from their photographs, 
using an image scanner, and to display a person's name, 
address, and telephone number along with his image. 
Generally, the amount of image data is immense, so that 
there is the problem that the image data would easily 
overflow a memory of a small portable electronic device 
when it is stored as it is in the memory. Electronic notebooks with a montage display function 
have been put to practical use which combine a plurality of 
pattern images prepared beforehand to display the resulting 
montage to thereby handle a greatly reduced amount of data 
in order to cope with the above problem. Those notebooks prepare a plurality of pattern images 
of each of the arts of a person's face such as an outline, 
a hair style, a front hair, eyebrows, eyes, a nose and a 
mouth, selects a pattern image having an appropriate form 
for each part by means of a number, combine those selected 
part patterns into a montage image, and displays same. For example, even when the owner of the electronic 
notebook cannot remind of a person's face from data on his 
name, address and telephone number alone, he can instruct 
the notebook to display a montage image which gets a clue  
 
to reminding of the face of the recorded person. Thus, the image of a person's face can be displayed 
without increasing the capacity of the data memory. However, as described above, such conventional montage 
display electronic notebook which is a montage display 
prepares a plurality of pattern images of each of the parts 
of a face which are an outline, a hair style, a front hair, 
eyebrows, eyes, a nose and a mouth, and combines selected 
pattern images into a person's face image. Thus, the 
notebook has the following problems. In the creation of a montage, the user selects by 
visual comparison pattern images closest to the respective 
parts of a person's
