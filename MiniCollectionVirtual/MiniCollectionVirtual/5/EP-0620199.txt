<ABSTRACT>
A section control is disclosed for an 
individual section of an I.S. machine. The control 

includes a manifold having a planar surface and a 
housing for a plurality of fluid flow control 

devices. The housing also has a planar surface. The 
housing is releasably mounted on the manifold with 

the planar surfaces in engagement and the devices are 
releasably secured to the housing. The housing 

includes inlet conduits communicating with the 
housing planar surface for supplying controlled fluid 

to each of the devices and a corresponding plurality 
of outlet conduits communicating with the housing 

planar surface for receiving controlled fluid from 
the devices. A corresponding plurality of inlet 

conduits in the manifold deliver controlled liquid to 
a corresponding one of the plurality of housing inlet 

conduits, and a corresponding plurality of outlet 
conduits in the manifold receive controlled liquid 

from a corresponding one of the plurality of housing 
outlet conduits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to I.S. (individual 
section) machines which make glass containers 
from molten gobs of glass. Each individual section of an I.S. machine has 
a blank side which forms a parison from the gob in a 
blank side mold and a blow side which forms the final 
glass container from the parison in a blow side mold. 
A number of movable mechanisms such as a blank side 
mold opening and closing mechanism, a plunger 
mechanism to be moved into a gob contained within the 
blank side mold, an invert mechanism for taking the 
formed parison and carrying it to the blow side, a 
blow side mold opening and closing mechanism, a 
takeout for removing the formed glass container from 
the blow side and depositing it on a dead plate and 
a pusher which will displace a bottle from the dead 
plate onto a conveyor are associated with each 
section. These mechanisms require air having a 
variety of pressures and lubrication which may 
require a continuous or intermittent supply of 
lubricating fluid. A variety of fluid flow control devices are 
conventionally used to control the flow of air and 
lubricating fluids. Valves are one type of fluid 
flow control devices for blocking or permitting flow 
and/or controlling the rate of flow and metering 
devices such as LINCOLN lubrication injectors are 
another type of fluid flow control devices used on 
I.S. machines. Some mechanisms required the use of 
fluid flow control devices generally referred to as 
constant cushion devices. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved system for mounting such fluid 
flow control devices so that they can be more 
efficiently serviced.  This invention generally comprises a section 
control for an individual section of an I.S. machine 
having a plurality of sections comprising
 
   a manifold having a planar surface,
 
   a plurality of fluid flow control devices,
 
   a housing for said plurality of fluid flow 
control devices, said housing having a planar 
surface,
 
   means for releasably mounting said housing 
on said manifold with said planar surfaces in 
engagement,
 
   means for securing said devices within 
said housing,
 
   said housing including inlet conduit means 
communicating with said housing planar surface for 
supplying controlled fluid to each of said devices 
and a corresponding plurality of outlet conduit means 
communicating with said housing planar surface for 
receiving controlled fluid from said devices,
 
   a corresponding plurality of inlet conduit 
means in said
