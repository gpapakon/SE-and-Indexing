<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to photothermographic materials and in particular 
to post-processing stabilization of photothermographic silver-containing 
materials. Silver halide containing photothermographic imaging materials processed 
with heat, and without liquid development have been known in the art for many 
years. These materials, also known as dry silver materials, generally comprise a 
support having thereon a photographic light-sensitive silver halide, a 
light-insensitive organic silver salt, and a reducing agent for the organic silver 
salt. The light-sensitive silver halide is in catalytic proximity to the light-insensitive 
organic silver salt so that the latent image, formed by irradiation of 
the silver halide, serves as a catalyst nucleus for the oxidation-reduction 
reaction of the organic silver salt with the reducing agent when the emulsion is 
heated above about 80°C. Such media are described, for example, in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 3,457,075, 3,839,049, and 4,260,677. The silver halide may 
also be generated in the media by a preheating step in which halide ion is 
released to form silver halide. A variety of ingredients may be added to these basic components to 
enhance performance. For example, toning agents may be incorporated to 
improve the color of the silver image of the photothermographic emulsions, as 
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,846,136; 3,994,732 and 4,021,249. Various 
methods to produce dye images and multicolor images with photographic color  
 
couplers and leuco dyes are known and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 
4,022,617; 3,531,286; 3,180,731; 3,761,270; 4,460,681; 4,883,747 and 
Research Disclosure, March 1989, item 29963. A common problem that exists with photothermographic systems is post-processing 
instability of the image. The photoactive silver halide still present in 
the developed image may continue to catalyze print-out of metallic silver during 
room light handling or exposure to heat or humidity. Thus, there exists a need 
for stabilization of the unreacted silver halide. The addition of separate 
post-processing image stabilizers has been used to impart post-processing 
stability. Most often these are sulfur containing compounds such as 
mercaptans, thiones, and thioethers as described in Research Disclosure, June 
1978, item 17029. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,245,033; 4,837,141 and 4,451,561 
describe sulfur compounds that are development restrainers for photothermographic 
systems. Mesoionic 1,2,4-triazolium-3-thiolates as fixing agents and 
silver halide stabilizers
