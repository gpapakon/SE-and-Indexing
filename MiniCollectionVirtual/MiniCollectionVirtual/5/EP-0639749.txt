<ABSTRACT>
A furnace refractory extraction system and method includes a selectively 
removable bottom portion which is attached to a refractory extraction device 

associated with a container for drawing the refractory lining of a coreless 
induction furnace into the container. A plug portion (66) in the furnace 

bottom (14) is selectively removable to provide access to a bottom wall of 
the refractory lining (20). An opening is made in the bottom wall (22) of 

the lining through which an extractor shaft (92) is inserted and then 
attached to the removable bottom portion of the furnace bottom (14). The 

other end of the shaft is attached to a piston and cylinder assembly (104) 
associated with the container (102) at the open end of the furnace. When the 

piston and cylinder assembly is powered, the lining is drawn into the 
container (102).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the art of coreless
induction furnaces such as those that contain a
replaceable refractory hearth lining, and more
particularly to a method and system for extracting the
lining from the furnace.The invention is particularly applicable to an
induction melting furnace in which a furnace content to
be heated is supported in a refractory hearth.
Sometimes the lining material itself or the furnace
content may be dangerous or harmful so that when it is
necessary to replace the refractory lining, the lining
should be contained for transport and ultimate disposal.
The invention is particularly applicable to a method and
system for extracting such a lining from the furnace and
placement in a container for transport, storage or
ultimate disposal. However, it will be appreciated by
those skilled in the art that the invention could be
readily adapted for use in other environments as, for
example, where cumbersome and potentially harmful
linings are to be replaced and contained upon extraction
from a furnace or other device.Refractory linings that are employed as
hearths useful for such induction melting furnaces are
typically composed of fire-proof materials commonly
referred to as dry ram type refractories such as silica,
alumina or magnesia. The linings have to be replaced at
regular intervals so the safety, convenience and
efficiency of the replacement process are important
considerations. In particular, where the furnace work
content is a dangerous and harmful item, such as one
that has been radioactively contaminated, minimal safety
precautions require containment of the refractory lining 
during both extraction of the lining from the furnace
and subsequent transport, storage and disposal.Prior known systems for refractory extraction
and discharge have met with varying degrees of success.
Such systems and methods have included lifting the
refractory lining by means of a crane from the furnace
cavity, dismantling of the furnace floor so that the
lining can be pushed out or breaking up of the
refractory lining with pneumatic hammers. U.S. Patent
No. 4,334,857 discloses a method and system where a
push-out device, acting underneath the furnace floor,
pushes out the furnace lining upon cooling of the lining
so that a separation occurs between the furnace
sidewalls and the lining.
GB 1,448,954 discloses a method of removing a crucible lining from
a furnace by either pushing or allowing the lining to fall down into
a container.None of the foregoing prior art systems are
useful with regard
