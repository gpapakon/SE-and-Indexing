<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radial-flow centrifugal pump having a bladed impeller which, on its circumference, is surrounded by fixed guide vanes (diffuser blades), wherein   - one or two guide vanes, with their leading, inner vane edge are situated close to the impeller and the gap between the leading inner vane edge and the impeller is up to 4 mm, preferably 2 mm, - and the gap between the leading vane edges of the remaining guide vanes and the impeller circumference is at least double the gap (b) of the proximal guide vanes (n).

<CLAIMS>
A radial centrifuaal pump having a wheel (1) which has blades 
and whose periphery is surrounded by fixed guide blades (5), 

characterized in that 

one or two guide blades (5a) are disposed with their leading 
inner blade edge (6) adjacent the wheel (1) and the distance (b) 

between the leading inner blade edge (6) and the wheel (1) is up 
to 4 mm, preferably 2 mm, 
and the distance (8a) between the leading edges of the 
remaining guide blades and the wheel periphery (4) is at least 

twice the distance (b) of the adjacent guide blade(s) (5a). 
A radial centrifugal pump according to claim 1, characterized 
in that when the wheel shaft (2) is substantially horizontal the 

adjacent blade (5a) is disposed closer to the wheel (1) in the 
upper zone.
