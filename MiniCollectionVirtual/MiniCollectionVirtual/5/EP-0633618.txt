<ABSTRACT>
The capacity of this secondary cell is 
hardly decreased when charging and discharging 

are repeated. The material of the cathode and/or 
anode of the cell is either bonded to the surface 

of the collector by a binder containing a bridged 
polymer or formed by coating on the collector 

a compound containing an active material and 
a polymer compound binder which contains a 

fluoric polymer compound which can be cured by 
radiation application. After the coating, radiation is 

applied to the material to cure the fluoric polymer 
compound.

<DESCRIPTION>
Secondary batteries are often used as power supplies for
driving portable electronic appliances or the like for the
purpose of economy and resource saving and their use is
remarkably expanding in these years. In accordance with size
reduction and performance up-grade of electronic appliances,
the batteries loaded therein are required to have a small size,
light weight, and high capacity. On the other hand,
conventional commonly used secondary batteries are lead-acid
batteries and nickel-cadmium batteries. Recently non-aqueous
lithium secondary batteries featuring a high energy density
have been proposed and used in practice.Lithium secondary batteries using non-aqueous
electrolytes, however, have the problem that they have a low
current density as compared with conventional secondary
batteries using aqueous solution because the electrolyte using
a non-aqueous solvent as an ion-conducting medium has a lower
ion-conducting rate. Proposals were made to overcome such problems, for
example, by increasing the surface area of electrodes to
increase their contact area with the electrolyte. More
particularly, an electrode coating composition containing an
active material and a polymer binder is applied to a current
collector in the form of a thin metal foil to form a thin
electrode layer thereon and a plurality of such coated foils
are placed one on another or spirally wound with a separator
interleaved therebetween. For example, JP-A 63-121260
describes a lithium secondary cell using a non-aqueous liquid
electrolyte, LiCoO2 and/or LiNiO2 as a positive electrode, and
carbon as a negative electrode. Each such electrode is an
electrode layer of a microparticulate electrode active material
bonded in a polymer-base binder.However, some problems arise when an electrode layer is
formed on a current collector typically in the form of a metal
foil. Numerous repetition of charge-discharge cycles
exacerbates the interfacial adhesion between the current
collector and the electrode layer and lowers the discharge
capacity of the electrodes, resulting in an insufficient cycle
life. Fine particles of the electrode layer shed from the
current collector can cause short-circuits.One of the probable causes is that as the active material
is expanded and contracted by doping and dedoping of lithium
ions upon charging and discharging, defects occur at the
electrode layer-current collector interface, active material-conductive
material interface, active material-binder resin
interface, etc. Also there arise problems that
