<ABSTRACT>
A burner (10) for burning fuel in an oxidant having a fuel nozzle 
(12) sandwiched between 

upper (14) and lower (16) oxidant nozzles. The fuel nozzle and upper and 
lower oxidant 

nozzles produce fuel and oxidant jets of outwardly divergent, fan-shaped 
configuration to provide a wide uniform flame and thus the elimination 

of hot 
spots. Upper and lower secondary oxidant nozzles can be provided in 

staged 
combustion such that fuel is burned and oxidant supplied by the upper and 

lower oxidant nozzle means in the substoichiometric ratio and then 
combustion 

is completed by oxidant supplied by the secondary upper and lower oxidant 
nozzles. In another aspect, a nozzle is provided in which a passageway is 

divided in a lengthwise direction and thus the flow of oxidant flowing 
through 

the passageway is divided into a plurality of subflows of equal 
velocity and of 

gradually divergent configuration to prevent the decay of a fan-shaped 
flow of oxidant from the nozzle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel burner apparatus and method for burning a
fuel in an oxidant. More particularly, the present invention relates to such a fuel
burner apparatus and method in which the oxidant is oxygen or oxygen enriched air.
The present invention also relates to a nozzle that is capable of producing a flat,
divergent uniform flow of a fluid that is particularly suited for forming oxidant nozzles
used in a fuel burner apparatus and method in accordance with the present
invention.Fuel burners are used in many industrial applications in which a material to be
processed is melted, for example, glass, copper, aluminium, iron, and steel. In order
to maximise the heat available from the fuel, oxy-fuel burners have evolved in which
the fuel is burned in oxygen or oxygen enriched air. These burners generally
produce flames having a highly concentrated power output which can in turn
produce hot spots in the melt. Typically, such burners utilise high velocity oxidant
and high mass flow rates of fuel to produce the high power outputs. Taken together,
the concentrated heating tends to evolve volatiles within the melt and the high
velocities tend to entrain feed material to the exhaust of the furnace. The entrained
feed material and evolved volatiles can thereby be lost and pollute the atmosphere
or can form a deposit which accumulates within the furnace or exhaust heat
recovery systems used in conjunction with furnaces.A still further problem in oxy-fuel burners is that the high temperature combustion of
the fuel in oxygen or oxygen enriched air can produce polluting NOx.One proposal to flatten a gas flame so as to provide uniform heating and prevent hot
spots is set out in EP-A-0335728, in which a gas-injection lance has a relatively flat
outlet and is positioned under a burner so as to provide a relatively flat jet of gas
under the flame, thus flattening it.As will be discussed, the present invention provides a burner apparatus and method
that is less susceptible than prior art apparatus and methodology to forming hot 
spots and entraining feed particles within the flow of oxidant and fuel and further, is readily
adaptable to employ a NOx limiting form of combustion.Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of burning fuel in an oxidant
comprising producing a fuel jet of outwardly divergent, fan-shaped configuration so that the
fuel jet will burn within the oxidant with an outwardly extending and divergent flame; and
producing a lower oxidant jet separate and distinct from the
