<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for closing a rectangular opening (15) in a wall (13) of a box (10), having a plate (panel) (16) whose external circumferential contour is larger than the unobstructed width of the opening (15), so that a flange edge (33) of said plate (16) rests against the outer surface of the wall (13) in the installed state, and on whose one side a circumferential strip (22) is integrally formed which projects at right angles to the flat extent of the wall (plane of the plate) and whose outer surface is matched to the inner edge of the opening (15), so that the strip (22) at least engages in the opening (15) and guides the plate (16) in the opening (15). At least on the two mutually opposite regions (23, 24), which run at right angles to the box base (14), the strip (22) has first tabs (25, 26) which project at right angles thereto and outward with respect to the plate (16) and engage over the adjacent edge of the opening (15). A first wedge (61, 62) can in each case be inserted between the inner surface of the wall (13) and the first tabs (25, 26) in the assembled state, so that the plate (16) can be fixed in the opening. The first wedges (61, 62) are integrally formed on a bracket (17).

Device for closing a rectangular opening (15) in a wall
(13) of a housing (10) with a closure plate (16) whose

outer circumferential contour is larger than the inside
width of the opening, so that it abuts by a flange edge

(33) against the outer surface of the wall (13) in the
assembled state, and with one of whose sides is integrally

formed a peripheral strip (22) which projects
perpendicularly to its planar extent (plane of plate) and

whose outer surface is adapted to the inner edge of the
opening, so that the strip at least engages in the opening

and guides the plate in the opening, characterised in that
the strip (22) comprises, in the two mutually opposed

regions (23, 24) extending perpendicularly to the housing
bottom (14), first lugs (25, 26) projecting perpendicularly

thereto and outwardly relative to the plate (16) and, in
the region located opposite the bottom wall (14) of the

housing and extending parallel to the bottom wall, second
lugs (31) projecting perpendicularly to the strip (22) and

outwardly relative to the plate (16), wherein the first
lugs overlap the adjacent edge of the opening (15) and in

the assembled state between the latter and the inner
surface of the wall (13) can be introduced in each case a

first key (61, 62) and between the second lugs (31) and the
inner surface of the wall (13) a second key for fixing the

plate (16).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
first keys (61, 62) and the second key (60) form in one

piece a U-shaped frame (17) whose arms form the first keys
and whose web forms the second key.
Device according to either of claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that the first lugs (25, 26) have an L

shape whose free arm (27, 28) running parallel to the strip
(23, 24) points towards the flange edge (33), and in that

the first keys or the arms (61, 62) comprise a longitudinal
groove (65) in which the free arms (27) of the L shape of 

the first lugs (25) engage in the inserted state and so
serve to guide the first keys or the arms (61, 62).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that parallel to the edges of the opening

(15) running perpendicularly to the bottom is integrally
formed in each case a strip-like projection (67, 68) which

guides the first keys or the arms (61, 62) on their outer
surfaces.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, wherein
the housing is closable by means of a cover (70) which can

be placed on the housing edge, characterised in that on the
cover are integrally formed further projections (71) which

in the assembled state abut against the web and hold
tight the frame (17).
Device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that on the strip (22) in the region of

the strip base is provided a peripheral step (32) on the
outside which fits in the opening (15) and serves-to centre

the plate (16) in the opening (15).
