<ABSTRACT>
An improved port protector (10) for removably sealing an opening located at an end of a tubular member. The port protector (10) comprises a cap portion (12) including a top (18) and side walls (17, 19) and defining an interior for receiving the end of the tubular member and removably sealing the opening of the tubular member. The cap portion (19)  at least is constructed from a thermoplastic elastomer and the top (18) has a sufficiently thin cross-sectional thickness (a) to allow steam to pass through the top (18) into the opening of the tubular member during steam sterilization. Additionally, the port protector (10) includes means (14) extending from the cap portion (12) for allowing removal of the cap (12) from the tubular member. Additionnaly, the present invention provides an improved container assembly (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to removable
devices for maintaining a sterile environment within the
interior of a tubular member such as a port prior to useThe preamble of claim 1 is based on US-A-4 573 980.It is known to house medical solutions and products
in flexible plastic containers. These containers provide
a means for housing the solution prior to the solution
being administered to a patient or used for other
therapeutic applications.In order to access the interior of the container,
either to infuse solution therein or access a solution
contained therein, it is known to provide the containers
with one or more ports or fitments. These ports are
typically tubular in shape and define a flow path from
an interior of the container to the outside environment.Such ports may include a pierceable membrane or
injection site. In use, fluid is either added to the
container or accessed therefrom by inserting a needle,
cannula, or other member through the port piercing the
membrane or injection site.It is also known to connect a tubing to the port to
provide a fluid path to and/or away from the container.
The tubing can terminate in a cannula or luer connector
to allow the tubing to be coupled to another container
or a patient.In order to prevent contamination of the solution,
and infection to the patient, the transfer of solution
out of the container, and in many instances into the
container, must take place under sterile conditions.
Therefore, the distal ends of the port or connector 
(e.g., cannula, luer connector, etc.) are frequently
capped with a "port protector." The function of the port
protector is to preserve the sterile integrity of the
interior of the port or connector after the entire
container assembly has been assembled and terminally
sterilized. Most frequently, sterilization in the
medical industry is through the use of steam
sterilization. Steam sterilization typically takes place
under elevated temperatures and pressure, such as, for
example, 121°C (250°F).Once sterilized, the port protector must prevent any
microbial ingress from the exterior, non-sterile
environment, from reaching the interior of the port or
connector. Thus, a tight seal at the interface is one
of the most important functions of the port protector.One of the disadvantages of a tight seal, however,
is that it also prevents steam, during the steam
sterilization process, from reaching the interior of the
port or connector. This is particularly true of the
overlapping surfaces that must be sterilized in order to
insu

<CLAIMS>
A port protector removably attached over an open end of a tubular
member (40), the port protector comprising:


a cap portion (12) including a planar closure (18) and side walls
(17,19) defining an interior receiving said open end and sealingly engaging

the tubular member, the cap portion (12) at least being constructed from
a thermoplastic elastomer; a ring (14) extending from the cap portion to

facilitate removal of the cap portion (12) from the tubular member, the
ring being attached directly to the side walls (17,19) and extending from

opposite points on the side walls forming an enclosed opening between the
ring and the cap, the ring extending from the end of the side walls

opposite to said open end,

   characterised in that the closure (18) defines a top of the cap
portion (12), extending over said open end and spaced from the ring (14)

by the side walls (17,19), the ring (14) extends in a plane in parallel
spaced relation to the plane of said closure (18), and the closure (18) has

a sufficiently thin cross-sectional thickness to allow steam to pass through
the top into the opening of the tubular member during steam sterilization.
The port protector of Claim 1 wherein the top (18) of the cap (12)
has a thickness (a) of equal to or less than 0.65 millimeters.
The port protector of Claim 1 or 2, wherein the entire port
protector (10) is constructed from the same material.
The port protector of any preceding claim including touch indicators
for providing means for identifying products through touch. 
The port protector of any preceding claim wherein at least portions
of the port protector (10) are colour coded to provide visual means for

identifying product. 
The port protector of
any preceding

Claim wherein the port
protector (10) is constructed from at least one material

chosen from the group consisting of: thermoplastic
olefinic elastomers; styrenic thermoplastic elastomers;

polyamide thermoplastic elastomers; and elastomeric
compositions having at least 23% by weight hydrophilic

polymeric components.
A container assembly (30) including:

two containers (32,34), each including an interior, one
container (32) being designed to house a solution and a second

container (34) for receiving a solution, the first container
including a fluid flow line (36) and the second container

including a drain line (38), the fluid flow line (36) and drain
line (38) being in fluid communication with a connector (40)

including a tubular member;
the drain tube (38) not including a frangible cannula; and
a port protector (10) for removably sealing an opening
located at an end of the tubular member and constructed

according to any preceding claim.
