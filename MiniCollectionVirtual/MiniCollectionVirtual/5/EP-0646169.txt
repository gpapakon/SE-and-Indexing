<ABSTRACT>
This invention is an improved mild personal cleansing syndet bar comprising: long chain alkyl sulfate having essentially saturated C15-C22, preferably C16-C18, alkyl chains, more preferably cetearyl sulfate, a high lathering, mild synthetic surfactants comprising C12-C14 alkyl isethionate, soap, fatty acids, and paraffin wax, preferably a high melting point paraffin wax. The bar has good processability, improved smears, and good in-use properties without meaningful lather negatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MILD PERSONAL CLEANSING BARS WITH IMPROVED PROCESSABILITYCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Pat. Appln. Ser. No. 07/674,282, filed March 21, 1991.TECHNICAL FIELD This invention relates to personal cleansing bars based on synthetic surfactants and to processes of making them.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION "Soap, since its appearance in history, has helped safeguard two of our greatest treasures: our health and our children. Health is directly related to cleanliness. Data proves that the higher the consumption of soap in a country, the lower will be the infant mortality rate. "In industrialized countries, soap is the most-taken-for- granted and readily available personal care product used on our body daily. Soap is also the most inexpensive product we use in relation to its per use cost. In many less fortunate countries both laundry and toilet soaps are still scarce, expensive essentials. . . ."Soap is most probably the oldest of toiletries, and, in spite of being readily available in most parts of the world, it is still scarce in many countries. The oldest literary reference to soap relates to the washing of wool and is found in clay Sumerian tablets dating about 2500 B.C.E. Sumerian was a language spoken in the area of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, now Southern Iraq. The patriarch Abraham and his family came from Sumer. Another Sumerian tablet, dating 2200 B.C.E. gives the formula consisting of water, alkali and cassia oil. "Cleanliness is essential to our well being. A clean body, clean bath, clean home, and clean environment are the norm today." (Soap Technology for the 1990's, L. Spitz et al . , American Oil 

 Chemists' Society, Champaign, Illinois, pp. 1-2) This reference discusses syndet and combo bars, particularly on pp. 209-229.Synthetic surfactant-based personal cleansing bars have attracted much interest recently because they can be selected to 5 be milder to the skin than soap-based products. This mildness, however, comes with negatives to both the manufacturer and the consumer. The bar soap manufacturer experiences difficult processability due to the sticky nature of such products, as well as high raw material costs. The consumer experiences the negative ° performance properties of poor lather, messy smear, bar softness, and, consequently, high wear rates.The use of paraffin wax in synthetic surfactant-based bars, per se, is known. However, the known bars suffer from a combi¬ nation of harshness and/or lather deficiencies. E.g., U.S. Pat. 5 No.

1. A personal cleansing bar comprising: from about 10% to about 40% of essentially saturated long chain C15-C 2 alkyl sulfate; from about 10% to about 40% of paraffin wax having a melting point of from about 130'F/54'C to about 180'F/82'C; from about 15% to about 40% lathering mild synthetic surfactant; and wherein said lathering mild synthetic surfactant is selected from C 2-C14 isethionate, C12-C14 alkyl glyceryl ether sulfonate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, and mixtures thereof; from about 8% to about 25% free fatty acid; from about 2% to about 15% soap; and from about 1.5% to about 10% water; and wherein at least about 10% of said bar is said mild lathering C12-C14 alkyl isethionate.
2. A personal cleansing bar comprising: from about 15% to about 35% of saturated long chain (C16-C18) alkyl sulfate; from about 3% to about 12% of soap; from about 18% to about 35% of lathering mild surfactant; from about 13% to about 35% of paraffin wax having a melting point of from about 140'F/60'C to about 165'F/74'C; and from about 2% to about 8% water; lauric (C12) and stearic (Ci6-Cιβ) free fatty acids having a ratio of from about 2.5:1 to about 1:2, said free fatty acids being present at a level of from about 10% to about 20%; and wherein said bar has a pH of from about 4.0 to about 9.
