<ABSTRACT>
A flexible wound dressing product (10) includes a thin-film 
layer (14), an adhesive layer (24), a backing layer (26) which 

may be porous, an optional support layer (34), an optional 
release liner (46), and a hydrogel material (42). Where the 

backing layer is porous, the backing layer can be secured to the 
hydrogel material without the use of an adhesive. In another 

embodiment, the backing layer may be transparent to permit 
viewing of the healing process without removal of the wound 

dressing. The wound dressing may also include a removable tab 
(48) interposed between the thin film layer (14) and release 

liner (46), providing a grippable surface for the removal of the 
release liner (46) from the transparent thin film layer (14) and 

to facilitate the handling of said wound dressing during 
application of the dressing to the wound.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wound dressings and, more
particularly, to a flexible wound dressing product containing a
hydrogel substance.Secreting skin wounds, such as decubitus ulcers and open
surgical wounds, have long presented a medical challenge in
keeping such wounds sterile and relatively dry. The accumulation
in wound crevices of wound exudate, such as blood, pustulation
and other wound fluids, promotes growth of bacteria and crusted
organisms which cause infection and delay the healing process.
However, since it is often desirable to allow a wound to heal in
a slightly moist or occlusive state, as it is believed that this
may accelerate healing, excess wound exudate must be removed. If
excess wound exudate remains on a wound, a "blister" of exudate
can form under the wound dressing which is not only unsightly,
but also may cause the dressing to leak, thereby defeating the
aim of sterility. Existing methods of aspiration, however, can
lead to wound infection or can destroy sterility. Additionally,
it is not desirable to remove all exudate, as that would result
in a dry wound and, hence, a slower healing process.Known aqueous moisture-absorbing wound dressing systems have
additional problems in that the aqueous material is generally
contained in the center portion of a wound dressing, with a bulky
adhesive border, such as a foam border. Problems with such
borders include decreased comfort, conformity and adhesion, as
well as the existence of a "lifting edge" that can catch on
clothes or bed sheets, thereby exposing the wound to bacteria and
infection. In addition, observation of the wound by medical
personnel may require lifting the wound dressing, thereby
exposing the wound, again creating a situation where bacteria and
infection can be introduced to the wound site.Adhesive wound dressings, similar to that disclosed by Ward,
U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,232, issued June 28, 1988, are frequently
constructed of a polymer film having one adhesive surface. The
polymer film is extremely thin and, therefore, difficult to 
handle during application to the wound. Further, it is desirable
to apply the wound dressing to the patient's skin without
touching the surface of the dressing that is to come into contact
with the skin. The prior art discloses several methods for
facilitating handling of the wound dressing. Ward, for instance,
discloses a "handle" portion along one edge of the dressing.
After the dressing is applied, the handle may be removed by
tearing, or it may carry an adhesive coating so that it

<CLAIMS>
A wound dressing product (10), comprising:

a thin-film layer (14) having a center portion (16) and a
perimeter portion (18) around said center portion and

further having first side (20) and a second side (22);
a backing layer (26) having a first side (28) and a second
side (30), said first side (28) adhered to said second side

(22) of said thin-film layer (14) by an said adhesive
layer (24); and
a hydrogel material (42) having a first side (43) and a
second side (45), 
characterised in that
 the backing layer
(26) is porous such that the first side (43) of said hydrogel

material (42) forms an adhesive-like bond to said
second side (30) of said porous backing layer (26)

without an adhesive layer being positioned therebetween.
A wound dressing product as claimed in claim 1, wherein
said porous backing layer (26) comprises a filled polyolefin

foam.
A wound dressing product as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
further comprising a release liner (46) secured to said

second side (45) of said hydrogel material. 
A wound dressing product according to any one of the
preceding claims, wherein said hydrogel material (42)

comprises:

(a) from about 0% to about 90% by weight polyhydric alcohol;
(b) from about 6% to about 60% by weight aliphatic diisocyanate-terminated
prepolymer;
(c) from about 4% to about 40% by weight polyethylene
oxide-based polyamine;
(d) up to about 2% by weight sodium chloride; and
(e) the balance water.
A wound dressing product according to any one of the
preceding claims, 
characterised in that
, it further
comprises a support layer (34) having a first side (36)

and a second side (38) and comprises a permeable fabric
having a plurality of interstices (40) therewithin, said

support layer (34) secured to said hydrogel material (42)
and located beetween said hydrogel material and said porous

backing layer (26), wherein said hydrogel material
(42) penetrates said interstices (40) to said first side

of said support layer (34) such that said hydrogel material
resides on both said first side and said second side of

said support layer, said hydrogel material adhering to
said second side of said backing layer such that said

first side (36) of said support layer is adjacent to said
second side (30) of said backing layer. 
A wound dressing product as claimed in claim 3, 
characterised
in that
 at least one removable tab (48) is interposed
between said thin-film layer (14) and said release liner

portion of said second side of said thin-film layer by

means of said adhesive layer providing a grippable surface
for the removal of said release line from said thin-film

layer and to facilitate the handling of said wound dressing
during application of said dressing to the wound.
A wound dressing product as claimed in claim 6, wherein
