<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve of the cylindrical seat type, conical seat type or slide type, intended to reduce the differential pressure before the complete opening or closing of the valve. The valve (10) is comprised of a body (11) wherein is provided a central cavity forming the seat (12) for a movable element (13). Said movable element has an internal chamber (16), an inlet channel (17) and at least one outlet channel (18) opening into said chamber and which are arranged to provide for the communication of the two connectors (14, 15) of the valve. It is also comprised of a movable shutter (19) integral with a control rod (20) to provide successively for the opening between the inlet channel (17) and the outlet channel (18) through the chamber (16), and for the displacement of said movable element (13) at the opening or at the closing of the valve (10). Applications: hydraulic circuits with high differential pressures, decompression circuits, pressure balancing circuits, circuits with corrosive fluid.
