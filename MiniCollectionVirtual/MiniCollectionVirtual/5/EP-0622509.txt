<ABSTRACT>
Furniture hinge (10) for the pivotable articulation of a door leaf (20) on the body (12) of a cupboard, of which the door-side front side is narrowed by a frame (14) which projects in at right angles from the side walls and is at least partially covered over by the inner side of the door leaf in the closed position. The hinge (10) exhibits a hinge arm (26) which consists of sheet metal and exhibits a fastening plate (32) which can be positioned on the free end surface (16), directed away from the side wall, of a frame element (14) of the frame and can be releasibly fastened there, of which the width corresponds essentially to the width of the end surface (16) of the frame element (14) and which bears the actual arm portion (28) which is coupled, via an articulation mechanism, to the stop part (22) fitted on the door leaf. In each case at least one slat (36; 38), which is turned over essentially at right angles onto that flat side of the frame element (14) on the outside and inside of the cupboard, respectively, is cut in on the front and rear border of the fastening plate (32). The flap or flaps (38) on the inside of the cupboard is or are provided with a protrusion (40) which projects towards that flat side of the frame element (14) which is on the inside of the cupboard and is tapered or bevelled in the manner of a cutter.

Cabinet hinge for hanging a door on a cabinet carcase whose front opening is 
narrowed by a frame which is formed of stiles and rails reaching inward from the walls, 

which the door in the closed position at least partially conceals, and with a hinge arm of sheet 
metal which has a fastening plate which can be placed on the free edge, facing away from the 

side wall, of a stile of the frame and there releasably fastened, and which has a width 
corresponding substantially to the width of the edge of the stile and bears the actual arm 

section coupled by a joint mechanism to the hinge part attached to the door, 
characterized in that on [both the]
 front and rear margin of each of the fastening plates at 
least one tab is cut, these being bent, one tab substantially at right angles against the cabinet-exterior 

flat side of the stile and the other substantially at right angles against the cabinet-interior 
flat side of the stile, and of these tabs the cabinet-interior tab is provided with a 

pointed or knife-edged projection reaching toward the cabinet-interior flat side of the stile. 
Hinge according to claim 1, in which, of the bent tabs provided on the outer and inner 
margins of the fastening plate, at least the tabs of one of the margins are disposed resiliently 

deformably on the fastening plate, so that the distance existing between them is variable in a 
given range without permanent deformation. 
Hinge according to claim 2, in which the tabs are made springy. 
Hinge according to claim 2 or 3, in which the tabs are created on a portion of the 
fastening plate of the hinge arm, which in turn is joined in a resiliently deformable manner to 

the remaining part of the fastening plate. 
Hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 4, in which the projection provided on the 
cabinet-interior tab of the hinge is provided on the free end of the tab fastening away from  

 
the fastening plate and is knife-edged, and has an approximately segmental shape. 
Hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 5, in which an elongated fastening opening 
(34) running longitudinally of the end face of the associated stile is provided in the fastening 

plate of the hinge for a screw to be driven into the stile. 
Hinge according to any one of claims 1 to 6, in which the tabs provided at the 
cabinet-exterior margin of the fastening plate of the hinge have a rounded cross section at 

their free end on the side facing the cabinet-exterior flat side of the associated stile
