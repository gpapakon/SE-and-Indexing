<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a method for purifying alkanolamine solutions which have lost at least a portion of their acid gas sorption capacity due to degradation of the alkanolamine into heat stable salts. Particularly, it has been found that the alkanolamine solution (28) may be rejuvenated by charging the solution to the feed zone of a distillation column reactor (40) at temperatures above about 160  DEG C and pressure of less than about 2000 mm Hg.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the reclamation 
of alkanolamine solutions useful to sorb acid gas 
constituents from a gas stream. More specifically, the 
invention relates to a method for purifying and 
rejuvenating spent alkanolamine solutions to reduce 
corrosivity and to restore acid gas sorption capacity. Alkanolamine process units remove H2S and CO2 from 
gaseous process streams, typically by countercurrently 
contacting an aqueous solution containing from about 
20% to about 50% by weight of an alkanolamine with a 
gas stream containing H2S and/or CO2. Various amines, such as monoethanol amine (MEA), 
diethanol amine (DEA), and triethanolamine (TEA), 
merely to name a few, are useful in acid gas sorption. 
While each of these amines is an effective acid gas 
sorbent, sorption process conditions typically require 
the use of one or two selected alkanolamines due to the 
different boiling points of the various alkanolamines. The removal of hydrogen sulfide from gaseous 
streams, such as the waste gases liberated in the 
course of various chemical and industrial processes, 
for example, in wood pulping, natural gas and crude oil 
production and in petroleum refining, has become 
increasingly important in combating atmospheric 
pollution. Hydrogen sulfide containing gases not only 
have an offensive odor, but such gases may cause damage 
to vegetation, painted surfaces and wildlife, and 
further may constitute a significant health hazard to 
humans. Government-wide regulations have increasingly 
imposed lower tolerances on the content of hydrogen 
sulfide which can be vented to the atmosphere, and it 
is now imperative in many localities to remove  
 
virtually all the hydrogen sulfide under the penalty of 
an absolute ban on continuing operation of a plant or 
the like which produces the hydrogen sulfide-containing 
gaseous stream. Solutions of water and one or more the 
alkanolamines are widely used in industry to remove 
hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide from such gaseous 
streams. Corrosion in alkanolamine units significantly 
increases both operating and maintenance costs. The 
mechanisms of corrosive attack include general 
corrosive thinning, pitting corrosion-erosion, and 
stress-corrosion cracking. Corrosion control 
techniques include the use of more expensive corrosion 
and erosion resistant alloys, continuous or periodic 
removal of corrosion-promoting agents in suspended 
solids by filtration, activated carbon adsorption, or 
by the addition of corrosion inhibitors. (See Kohl,

<CLAIMS>
A method for rejuvenating a spent 
alkanolamine solution which has lost at least a 

portion of its theoretical acid gas sorption capacity 
comprising the steps of: 


(a) flowing the spent alkanolamine solution to a 
distillation column reactor into a feed zone, wherein 

the feed zone is maintained at temperature above 120Â°C 
and wherein the distillation column reactor is 

maintained at pressure below about 2000 mm Hg; 
(b) charging 
H

S to the distillation column 
reactor; 
(c) controlling residence time of the spent 
alkanolamine solution in the distillation column 

reactor to at least partially convert the spent 
alkanolamine solution to a distillable product mixture 

having a greater affinity for acid gas sorption than 
the spent alkanolamine solution; 
(d) fractionating the distillable product mixture 
within the distillation column reactor; 
(e) withdrawing a rejuvenated alkanolamine 
solution from the distillation column reactor at a 

point above the feed zone; and 
(f) withdrawing a stream containing rejected 
residue including heat stable salts from the 

distillation column reactor at a point below the feed 
zone. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising 
introducing steam to the distillation column reactor at 

a point below the feed zone.  
 
The method of claim 2 wherein the steam is 
introduced to the alkanolamine solution and charged to 

the distillation column reactor in volume ratios of 
steam:spent alkanolamine charge of from about 0.01 to 

about 10. 
The method of claim 1 further comprising 
controlling pressure within the distillation column 

reactor at less than about 760 mm Hg. 
The method of claim 4 wherein pressure within 
the distillation column reactor is less than about 150 

mm Hg. 
The method of claim 1 wherein the mass 
flowrate of diethanolamine withdrawn in the rejuvenated 

alkanolamine solution exceeds the mass flowrate of DEA 
charged to the distillation column reactor.
