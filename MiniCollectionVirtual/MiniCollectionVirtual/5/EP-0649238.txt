<ABSTRACT>
A computer network has a client computer (11) 
connected to a server computer (20). The client 

computer is used by a user to run an application program that performs a specific task, 
such as word processing. When the user instructs the application program to display 

resource information, such as information about the capabilities of all printers currently 
available for use by the application, the client computer sends a request to display the 

resource information to the server computer. The server computer receives the request 
and directly displays the resource 

information on a display (16) connected to the client 
computer. The resource information is displayed as a dialog box associated with the 

application program and consistent with the user interface established or followed by the 
application program.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the data processing field. More particularly, this invention is a 
computer network with distributed resource information. The rapid growth in the use of personal computers and workstations in the 1980's and 
early 1990's has thrust the computer industry into an exciting, challenging, and tumultuous 
era. Rapidly exiting the computer landscape are the good old days of yesteryear, where all 
of the computing power and function was centrally located in a mainframe computer, 
tightly controlled in a "glass house" environment. Also rare today is a true standalone 
personal computer, which, like the mainframe computer but on a smaller scale, controlled 
and "owned" all information requested by the user. Today's computing model is decidedly more complex. Computers are hooked up in local 
area networks, connected to other personal computers, workstations, minicomputers, 
and/or mainframes, in addition to resources such as printers, tape drives, etc. The 
buzzwords of today are "client/server" and "distributed computing" -- high level concepts 
for the sharing of the responsibility for running an application that performs a specific user 
task. The advantages of a client/server or distributed computing environment are 
enormous: the power and function of a mainframe computer can be replicated or even 
enhanced by several orders of magnitude -- all for a fraction of the cost of the mainframe 
computer. But these enormous advantages do not come without enormous problems. One such 
problem is in keeping track of and presenting resource information to an end user in a 
consistent, reliable manner. In the mainframe or standalone PC computing environments, 
this was relatively easy, since the mainframe or standalone PC controlled (and therefore 
knew about) all resources available to it, and also controlled the user interface. But in a 
client/server or distributed environment, managing resource information is much more 
complex. Resources can be scattered over several buildings, cities, or even countries, and  
 
can be controlled by anything from one to hundreds of interconnected personal computers, 
workstations, minicomputers or mainframes acting as servers for those particular 
resources. Managing resource information in a distributed computing environment has thus far 
proven to be a daunting task. Previous attempts at solving this problem either sacrifice the 
nature and power of the distributed environment, or mask the problem altogether. For 
example, one prior attempt to solve the

<CLAIMS>
A method of presenting resource information available to an application program (25) 
in a computer network (10), said computer network comprising a client computer (11) 

and a server computer (20), said method comprising the steps of: 
in said client computer, 

running said application program; 
receiving a request for the display of resource information from a user; 

transmitting a request (500) for said resource information to a server 
computer; 

in said server computer, 
receiving said request for said resource information from said client computer; 

determining that said server computer has said resource information; and 
directly displaying said resource information on a display (16) connected to said client 

computer. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step of: 
in said client computer, 

checking to see if said client computer has said resource information, 
wherein said transmitting step is executed if said checking step determines that said client 

computer does not have said resource information. 
The method of claim 2, wherein said resource information is displayed in a dialog box. 
The method of claim 3, further comprising the steps of: 
in said server computer,

 
receiving changed status information from a resource; and 

updating said resource information based on said changed status information. 
A client computer (11) in a computer network (10), said client computer connected to a 
dialog server computer (20) and to a display (16), said client computer comprising: 

means for running an application program (25); 
means for receiving a request for the display of resource information from a user; 

means for transmitting a request (500) for said resource information to a server computer; 
said display comprising: 

means for receiving said resource information directly from said dialog server computer; 
and 

means for displaying said resource information as a dialog box associated with said 
application program.
