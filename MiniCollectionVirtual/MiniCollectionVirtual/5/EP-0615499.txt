<ABSTRACT>
The air cushion chambers of an air cushion vehicle are horizontally delimited by a skirt. The skirt comprises brushes with elongated downwards extended filaments (9), which have downwards diminishing cross-sectional area thereby providing the brushes with sufficient stiffness to maintain the pressure in the air cushion chamber and such a large flexibility in the lower section of the skirt that ice can hardly deposit thereon. The filament members are mounted in a guide profile (2) in such a manner that above the members there is a chamber (12) for dispersion and conveying of deicing fluid which form the chamber (12) via a flow passage in every filament member may pass down into a clearspace (10) between the filaments (9). It is possible to design at least one of the filaments (109) with a forwards protruding web (115) on one of its sides and a backwards protruding web (116) on its other side. When mounted, the webs of the filaments may seize each other when the skirt is transversely deflected and thereby the webs lock the individual brush members to one another which provides the skirt with a larger stiffness in the transverse direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a filament member for a 
skirt for an air cushion vehicle which has beneath the 
bottom of the vehicle hull a number of air cushion 
chambers which are delimited in horizontal direction by 
the skirt and into which air supply means may blow air 
for maintaining the air cushion in the air cushion 
chamber during the operation of the vehicle, the skirt 
including elongate, downwards extending filaments. A skirt for an air cushion vehicle is known from 
the USA patents Nos. 3 249 167 and 3 172 494 showing 
skirts with brushes in the form of rods, wires, cords, 
chains or filaments made of plastic. Another skirt is known from SE-B-305812, where 
skirt members are hanging down from the hull. The 
flexible skirt members are shaped with large cross-sections 
merging into each other such as triangular 
cross-sections with the apex facing alternatively inwards 
and outwards. These skirt members are not of the filament 
type. The skirt extends along the periphery of the air 
cushion chambers and serves to prevent the air from 
freely escaping the chambers. In the traditional air 
cushion vehicles the skirt is constructed from a 
continuous rubber sheet, but such a sheet is frequently 
exposed to damage when the air cushion vehicle crosses 
obstacles which may seize the skirt. A skirt of brushes as known from the above USA-patents 
possess the advantage that obstacles may pass 
freely through the brushes without damaging these. It is a well known problem of air cushion vehicles 
that they hardly can be used in waters where there is 
risk of icing up because the ice is easily formed on the 
skirt and impedes the correct functioning thereof. This 
problem is especially distinct by the brushformed skirts 
having a very large surface area compared to the length 
of the skirt. As air cushion vehicles are very sensitive 
to weight changes even smaller deposits of ice on the  
 
skirt may demand suspension of the vehicle operation. The object of the invention is to provide a skirt 
more appropriate for navigation in cold waters. With this aim the filament member according to the 
invention is characterized in that the filament member 
has an upper base portion with engagement means for the 
attachment of the member to a retainer, and that the 
member includes several juxtaposed elongate filaments 
extending from the base portion and having less cross-sectional 
area at the free end of the filaments than at 
the root thereof. Such a member may in a simple manner be 
manufactured from a plastics

Filament member for a skirt for an air cushion 
vehicle which has beneath the bottom (5) of the vehicle 

hull a number of air cushion chambers which are delimited 
in horizontal direction by the skirt and into which air 

supply means may blow air for maintaining the air cushion 
in the air cushion chamber during the operation of the 

vehicle, the skirt including elongate, downwards 
extending filaments (9;109), 
characterized
 in that the 
filament member (1;101) has an upper base portion (6;106) 

with engagement means (7;107) for attachment of the 
member to a retainer (2), and that the member (1) 

includes several juxtaposed elongate filaments (9;109) 
extending from the base portion and having less cross-sectional 

area at the free end of the filaments than at 
the root thereof. 
Filament member according to claim 1, 

characterized
 in that the filaments are positioned 
outside each other in the transverse direction of the 

skirt, and that at the base portion there is at least one 
flow passage (11;111) which may set at least one 

interspace (10;110) between the filaments (9;109) in flow 
communication with a chamber (12) for admission of de-icing 

fluid. 
Filament member according to claim 1 or 2, 

characterized
 in that the thickness of the filament 
member (1;101) in the longitudinal direction of the skirt 

is substantially even over the entire length of the 
member, while the width of the filaments (9;109) of the 

member, in the transverse direction of the skirt, 
diminishes towards the tip of the filaments. 
Filament member according to claim 2, 

characterized
 in that the flow passage (11;111) is 
arranged in the base portion (6;106) of the member so 

that the passage extends from an interspace (10;110)  
 

between the filaments to the upper side of the base 
portion. 
Filament member according to any one of the 
claims 2 to 4, 
characterized
 in that the retainer is a 
guide profile (2) with a downwards facing opening for 

receiving the filament members (1;101), and that the 
profile and the engagement means (7;107) on the members 

are designed so that in the profile above the assembled 
members there is a chamber (12) extending in the 

longitudinal direction of the profile and serving for 
dispersion and conveying of de-icing fluid. 
Filament member (101) according to any one of 
claims 1 to 5, 
characterized
 in that at least one of the
