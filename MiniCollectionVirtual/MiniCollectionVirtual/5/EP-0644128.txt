<ABSTRACT>
A sealable can which may be evacuated of air 
comprises can body (1), a cap unit (2) and a vacuum pump 

(3), the cap unit being fitted onto the can body, the 
vacuum pump being placed on the cap unit to pump the air 

from the can body so that the can body becomes 
evacuated and sealed tightly by the can unit to preserve 

food kept therein good and fresh for a long period of 
time.

<DESCRIPTION>
Nowadays containers for preserving food generally comprise a container and
cap for the container. Though food kept in the container is preserved by the cap, but
some air is also kept in the container when the cap is fitted to the container, in spite
of air being kept out of the container by the cap. So the food in the container can
gradually deteriorate in its quality after a long period of time due to the air remaining
therein.EP 0378866 relates to a vacuum container having an indication member for
indicating a pressure difference between the interior and exterior of the container. A
one-way valve which opens laterally is provided in the cover of the container to allow
air to be removed therefrom using the valve described in EP 0234607. However, this
container does not consider the formation of a satisfactory seal between the container
and its exterior and the vacuum pump for evacuation of the air.DE 3345599 describes a type of non-return valve having a valve flap which is
mounted on a valve housing and covering through apertures.According to the invention there is provided a combination of a sealable can for preserving
food and a vacuum pump by means of which the can can be evacuated so that the food kept
therein can be
preserved with its quality good and fresh for a long period of time.A combination of a sealable can which may be evacuated and a vacuum pump
in accordance with the present 
invention comprises a cylindrical can body, a cap unit fittable on said can body, and a vacuum pump, being
characterised in that the cap unit has a sealing cap body, having a central upper recess
a central through hole in said upper recess, a plurality of air holes spaced around said
central through hole, a downwardly projecting annular wall engaging a small bottom
cap, a projecting outer circumferential curved edge, a first annular downwardly
projecting wall extending from said curved edge, a second annular downwardly
projecting wall of a smaller diameter than said first annular wall, an annular groove
defined by said first and second annular walls for an annular gasket to engage in;
the small bottom cap fitting around said downwardly projecting annular
wall, and having air holes;the annular gasket fitting in said annular groove of said sealing cap body for
blocking through flow of air;an air valve in the recess of said sealing cap body, closing said air holes, and
having a mushroom-shaped projection extending downwards to pass through said
central hole of said sealing cap body to keep said valve in place, and

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a sealable can and a vacuum pump therefor comprising

a cylindrical can body (1);
a cap unit (2) fittable on said can body (1), and a vacuum pump (3), characterised in
that the cap unit has a sealing cap body (20) having a central upper recess (200) a

central through hole (201) in said upper recess (200), a plurality of air holes (202) spaced
around said central through hole (201), a downwardly projecting annular wall (203)

engaging a small bottom cap (21), a projecting outer circumferential curved edge
(204), a first annular downwardly projecting wall (205) extending from said curved

edge (204), a second annular downwardly projecting wall (206) of a smaller diameter than
said first annular wall (205), an annular groove (207) defined by said first and second

annular walls (205, 206) for an annular gasket (22) to engage in;
the small bottom cap (21) fitting around said downwardly projecting
annular wall (203), and having air holes (210);
the annular gasket (22) fitting in said annular groove (207) of said sealing cap body (20)
for blocking through flow of air;
an air valve (23) in the recess (200) of said sealing cap body (20), closing said
air holes (210), and having a mushroom-shaped projection (230) extending downwards to

pass through said central hole (201) of said sealing cap body (20) to keep said valve
(23) in place, and upwardly sloping projections (231) for pulling said air valve (23);
a small upper cap (24) covering said air valve (23), having a circumferential
downwardly sloping surface (240) and opposing slots (241, 242) for the two upwardly 

sloping projections (231) to protrude upwardly therethrough and the vacuum pump (3)
independently provided and to be placed on the top of said cap unit (2) for pumping

the air from said can body (1); the vacuum pump (3) having a stationary cylinder (30) having
a central passageway (300) for a pull cylinder (32) to fit and move therein

up and down and a stop
annular edge (301) for stopping the pull cylinder (32) and a flange (302) around the

bottom fitting in an annular groove (310) of a socket (31);
the pull cylinder (32) having an annular groove (322)
in a lower end portion, opposite air holes (323) in said annular

groove (322), an annular gasket (33) engaging said annular groove (322); and
a handle (34) having a cylindrical portion with two lateral curved portions
fixed firmly on the top of said pull cylinder (32) above the stationary cylinder (30) to pull said

pull cylinder (32) for pumping out the air in said body (1), and having an inner groove (340) and
an inner sloping edge (3
41) below said groove;
whereby said vacuum pump (3) can be placed on the top of said cap unit (2)
wherein an engaging edge (311) of the socket (31) is tightly placed on the recess

(200) of the sealing cap body (20) and
said pull cylinder (32) is pulled up and down in said stationary cylinder (30) to draw

out the air from said can body (1) forming a vacuum so that internal and atmospheric
pressure difference causes said air valve (23) of the cap unit (2) to close tightly said air holes (210)

in said sealed cap body (20), thereby preserving food therein for a long period of
time.
