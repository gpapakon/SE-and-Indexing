<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention relates to compositions 
of poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) 
comprising a low molecular weight aliphatic polyester 
which have improved crystallization properties. These 
compositions are useful as injection molding compounds 
for a variety of applications. There is a continuing need in various industrial 
arts such as the electrical/electronics, automotive, and 
appliance industries for injection molding compounds 
which have improved crystallization properties. It is well known to those skilled in the art that 
glass fiber reinforced poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene 
terephthalate) molding compositions crystallize rapidly 
when injection molded using mold temperatures greater 
than 150°C. At temperatures of greater than 150°C, oil 
heated molds are usually used. However, some molders 
only have the capability of heating molds to 
temperatures of 80 to 120°C using hot water or steam. 
Therefore, it is necessary to add a crystallization aid 
to the glass fiber reinforced poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene) 
terephthalate compositions so that rapid 
crystallization can occur at mold temperatures 
significantly less than 150°C. Low molecular weight aliphatic polyesters can be 
used as crystallization aids. However, there is 
commonly a breakdown in the molecular weight of the 
poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene) terephthalate that 
occurs with the use of these low molecular weight 
aliphatic polyesters as crystallization aids.  
 It is a distinct advantage, therefore, to formulate 
reinforced molding compositions based on poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene) 
terephthalate comprising a low 
molecular weight aliphatic polyester which allows for 
rapid crystallization at mold temperatures of 
significantly less than 150°C without the usual 
breakdown in the molecular weight of the poly(1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene) 
terephthalate. U.S. Patent 3,565,852 discloses the use of 
polyesters with melting points less than or equal to 
150°C with at least partial aliphatic character as 
crystallization aids for poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
(PET) only. European patent application 0,387,398, published on 
September 19, 1990 discloses the use of aliphatic 
polyesters as crystallization aids for PET only. This 
application discloses that aliphatic polyesters react 
with PET. U.S. Patent 4,223,113 discloses the use of 
oligomeric aliphatic polyesters as crystallization aids 
for poly(alkylene terephthalates). The aliphatic 
polyesters used are based on acids(C1-C20) and diols 
(C2
