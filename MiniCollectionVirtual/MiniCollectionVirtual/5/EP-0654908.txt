<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to analog to 
digital conversion systems and, more particularly, to 
those which are suitable for converting an analog signal 
from an image sensor into a digital signal. Digital electronic imaging systems which use 
charge coupled devices (CCDs) for image capture have 
common signal processing needs. These include 
correlated double sampling (CDS), voltage gain, dc level 
stabilization, and analog inversion. In earlier 
systems, these functions were realized using discrete 
electronic elements. Now, the need for more compact and 
cost-effective systems is driving designs towards the 
use of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) 
which integrate all of these functions into a single 
integrated circuit. Two additional functions which are often used 
to process CCD output signals in digital imaging systems 
are gamma correction and analog-to-digital (A/D) 
conversion. In general, gamma correction refers to an 
input-output transfer function where 
Vout = VinÎ³. In many imaging systems, gamma=0.454 which 
causes low CCD signal levels to receive greater voltage 
gain than high CCD signal levels. A/D conversion is a function which encodes 
continuously varying analog signals into discrete 
digital codes. A common A/D architecture is called a 
flash architecture. Here the analog voltage is 
presented to a bank of circuits (comparators) which 
compare this analog voltage to preset reference 
voltages. The comparators indicate whether the input  
 
voltage is above or below each reference voltage. The 
outputs of these comparators are then converted to a 
binary code which represents the analog input voltage. The precision to which an analog voltage is 
encoded is often expressed in terms of the number of 
digital bits N, in the binary code. For example, the 
binary code 00010010 is said to be 8 bits wide (has 8 
places each taking the value 0 or 1) and in this case 
represents the decimal value 18. Thus, an 8 bit digital 
code can represent up to 256 decimal values and can 
encode an analog voltage to an accuracy of 1 part in 
256. In the past, two stage type analog to digital 
conversion systems have been used with the first stage 
providing the most significant bits and the second stage 
the least significant bits. Such a system is shown in 
U.S. Patent 4,939,518. This system has problems in 
imaging applications in that the conversion is 
completely linear and does not provide enough 
quantization in the low level input signals and provides 
excess quantization in the

an image sensor and converts it to a piecewise-linear
