<ABSTRACT>
The engagement device (1) has a first seat (6) having a 
longitudinal extension and formed in a first end (2) of a 

lens (3) of a pair of eyeglasses. A second seat (7), also 
formed in the first end (2) of the lens (3), has an 

essentially circular configuration and communicates with the 
first seat (6). The engagement device (1) also has a 

longitudinal bridge (8) connected to a second end (4) of a 
temple (5) and a cylinder (9) connected to the bridge (8). 

The bridge (8) and the cylinder (9) are interposed 
transversely between two wings (10, 11) formed at the 

second end (4) of the temple (5). The bridge (8) is 
accommodated in the first seat (6) and the cylinder (9) is 

accommodated in the second seat (7). The walls laterally 
delimiting the first seat (6) may be manufactured at 

mutually different angles to each other according to the 
desired angle of the lens (3) with respect to the temple 

(5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engagement device 
particularly for at least one lens of a pair of sunglasses 
or spectacles. Eyeglasses are currently constituted by a front that 
supports a single lens or a pair of lenses; hinges for 
connection to temples are associated with the ends of said 
front. It is thus known to manufacture hinges which are 
constituted by two elements which are mutually associated so 
that they can rotate with respect to each other and the free 
ends of which can be embedded for example in the temple and 
in the front or are obtained or formed directly at the ends 
of said temple and said front. The manufacture and use of these conventional 
eyeglasses entails high manufacturing costs and drawbacks, 
such as the need to provide appropriate seats on the front 
to associate the lenses therewith by deforming said front or 
by using coupling screws, with consequent difficulty in lens 
replacement. The use of these conventional eyeglasses furthermore 
forces, during their design, to determine a preset position 
of the lens with respect to the temples and therefore with 
respect to the facing surface of the user's face; in other 
words, it is necessary to preset the pantoscopic angle 
without being able to modify it in any way. The aim of the present invention is therefore to solve 
the described technical problems, eliminating the drawbacks 
of the prior art and thus providing a pair of eyeglasses in  
 
which it is possible to rapidly and easily assemble the lens 
or lenses to the remaining parts that constitute the pair of 
eyeglasses to allow better industrialization. Within the scope of the above aim, an important object 
is to provide a pair of eyeglasses that allows to simply and 
quickly interchange its individual components without using 
particular tools. Another important object is to provide a pair of 
eyeglasses that allows to vary the pantoscopic angle 
according to specific requirements of the manufacturing 
process or of the user. Another object is to provide a device that associates 
with the preceding characteristics that of being reliable 
and safe in use and has low manufacturing costs. With the foregoing and other objects in view, there is 
provided an engagement device, particularly for at least one 
lens of a pair of sunglasses or spectacles, characterized in 
that it comprises means for temporary engagement between at 
least one end of said lens and the corresponding end of a 
temple or of a front, said means allowing to preset or vary 
the pantoscopic
