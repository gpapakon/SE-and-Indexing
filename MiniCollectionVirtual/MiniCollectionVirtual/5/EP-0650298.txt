<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus for coding a time-varying image divides the image signals whose image frame is N pixels x M 
lines (N pixels horizontally and M lines vertically) into a first image part which is an inner image portion having an 

image frame of N₁ pixels x M₁ lines (N₁ ≦ N and M₁ ≦ M), and a second image part which is the image portion outside 
the first image part. The first image part and the second image part are further divided into given independent division 

units each formed by a plurality of pixels. When the coded information is about given division units belonging to 
the second image part, an identification code is added to the header of each division unit. If the apparatus is only 

capable of decoding the image frame of N₁ pixels x M₁ lines, the apparatus reproduces only the first image part. The 
apparatus recognizes the identification code added to the header of a division unit belonging to the second image part, 

and skips over the coded information of the second image part.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a moving picture coding method for
coding a moving picture, a moving picture decoding method for
decoding a coded moving picture, and apparatuses therefor.In the case of digitizing a signal of a moving picture to
record and transmit digital data thus obtained, its data quantity
becomes extremely large. For this reason, coding (compression)
is implemented to that data. As a representative coding system,
there is so called MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group) system.
This MPEG is general name of the moving picture coding system
which has progressed in WG (Working Group) 11 of SC (Sub
Committee) 29 of JTC (Joint Technical Committee) 1 of ISO
(International Standardization Organization) and IEC
(International Electrotechnical Commission).Moreover, as a widely known format in the case of handling
a picture signal by a digital signal, there is Recommendation 601
(Rec. 601) of so called CCIR (Comite Consultatif Internationale
des Radio-communications (International Radio Consultative
Committee)). This Rec. 601 is the worldwide standardized format
of digital picture based on the component (so called 4:2:2
component) coding system. In the MPEG, the above-mentioned Rec. 601 format is used as
input/output picture format. In the NTSC zone of the scanning
line 525 lines/30 Hz, an input/output picture format as shown in
FIG. 11, for example, has been most popularly used. For example,
in MPEG2 (MPEG phase-2), picture of picture frame of frame of 720
pixels x 480 lines of Rec. 601 format is handled. On the other
hand, in MPEG1 (MPEG phase-1), picture of picture frame of frame
(SIF) of 360 pixels x 240 lines obtained by thinning pixels so
that resolutions in the longitudinal and lateral directions are
respectively equal to one half thereof is handled.A technique to allow the transmission format of picture to
have a relationship such that the ratio between length and
breadth of picture frame is expressed as 1:2 in dependency upon
difference of resolution is convenient in a hierarchical manner.
This is related to the following two reasons.First reason is that hardware configuration of thinning
filter and/or interpolating filter having ratio of 1:2 are
simpler than those of filters having other ratios.Second reason is that, in the case of constituting picture
coding/decoding apparatuses, it is possible to process picture
data by four image LSIs disposed in parallel for picture having
resolution which is one half of picture to be processed.An example of filter coefficients of the thinning filter is
