<ABSTRACT>
This elongated lighting system comprises a section (20) capable of receiving in its interior at least:   - two conductive strips (30; 31, 32) having a succession of small plates (33, 34) placed at predetermined distances so as to form pairs of electrical contacts supplying a succession of bulbs (50) arranged all along the elongated system between two adjacent contacts, - a reflective strip (40) of parabolic cross-section, arranged inside the section in the length direction of the latter, the focus of which strip is arranged in the vicinity of the centre of the bulbs, so as to constitute a linear reflector distributing a narrow light beam all along the elongated system, and - at least one diffusion grille (60; 65, 66) which can direct and reflect the light beam in a preferential direction.   The invention also extends to the use of a plurality of elongated systems for lighting hypermarkets (supermarkets), which systems are placed end-to-end, while arranging the grilles so as to mask the facing light sources.

<CLAIMS>
Lighting ramp including a profiled member that has 
attachment means and is adapted to receive within it at least two 

conductive strips (30;31,32), each having a succession of tabs 
(33,34) located at predetermined distances apart so as to form 

pairs of electric contacts for electrically powering a succession 
of bulbs (50) arranged along the length of the light assembly 

between two adjacent contacts, characterized by: 

a reflecting strip (40) having a parabolic shape in cross-section, 
arranged and extending continuously within the profiled 

member in its lengthwise direction, and traversed by the tabs 
(33,34) of the electrical contacts, so that the focus of the 

parabolic shape is in the vicinity of the center of the bulbs, in 
order to form a linear reflector that distributes a narrow beam of 

light all along said ramp, and 
at least one diffusion screen (60;65,66) disposed in the light 
beam and adapted to direct the light beam and to deflect it in a 

preferred direction. 
Lighting ramp according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the diffusion screen has at least a reflecting face and/or a 

non reflecting face. 
Lighting ramp according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the diffusion screen (60) includes fins (63) parallel to the 

elongated ramp. 
Lighting ramp according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the diffusion screen (65,66) includes fins (64) perpendicular 

to the elongated ramp. 
Lighting ramp according to claim 3 or 4, characterised 
in that said fins are cut out and folded portions in a strip (61) 

disposed in the lengthwise direction of the housing. 
Lighting ramp according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the diffusion screen (60) includes two superposed screens  

 
(64,65) having respective edges (62) that include positioning 

means (67,68) for placing the fins at uniform distances apart. 
Lighting ramp according to claim 1, characterised in 
that said housing (20) includes a first longitudinal opening (21) 

for the passage of the light beam, said opening being bordered by 
two lateral flanges (23 and 24), each flange provided with a 

plurality of facing longitudinal grooves (25) adapted to receive 
the reflector (40), the screens (60) and/or a protective plate 

(70). 
Lighting ramp according to claim 7, characterised in 
that said housing (20) further comprises a second opening (22) 

provided with fastening means intended to cooperate with an 
attachement rail (10). 
Lighting ramp according to claim 8, characterised in 
that said housing (20) includes beads (27) intended to cooperate 

with corresponding groove means (14,15) in the rail (10). 
Use of several lighting ramps according to one of the 
preceeding claims for illuminating large surfaces, characterised 

in that the ramps are arranged end to end in such a manner that 
the beam of light is substantially parallel to the surface in 

order to illuminate it uniformly. 
Use of several ramps according to claim 10, 
characterised in that the screens are arranged in such a manner so 

as to conceal the respective bulbs from view.
