<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus and method for 
doctor blade replacement in a flexographic press and, more 
particularly, to a fountain embodying a movable holder for the 
blades. Conventionally, doctor blades are provided to define 
the upper and lower ends of a fountain associated with an ink  
 
transfer roll -- such as an anilox roll. Illustrative of the 
basic structure is that shown in co-owned Patent 5,125,341. 
When it is desired to replace the doctor blades, a 
labor-intensive situation arises. Bolts have to be loosened and 
then retightened in order to clamp the doctor blades and if the 
operation is not carefully handled, a wave will be introduced 
into the blade. This is avoided by the instant invention which 
provides a doctor blade holder which is movably mounted on a 
sub-frame of the press. The sub-frame of the press is part of 
the basic fountain structure and is located immediately adjacent 
the anilox roll. The sub-frame has portions for clamping the 
doctor blade in place on the holder and bearing against the 
anilox roll. The invention makes it possible to equip the 
movable holder with the blades at either the press or at a 
location remote from the press -- but in any event, quickly 
install the blades thereby avoiding the laborious operations of 
the past. Other objects and advantages of the invention may be 
seen in the details of the ensuing specification. The invention is described in conjunction with 
illustrative embodiments in the accompanying drawing, in which

</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A fountain for a flexographic press having a frame 
(2) equipped with an ink transfer roll, (21, 121, 221) a subframe 

(22, 122, 222) mounted on said frame adjacent said roll, a holder 
(24, 124, 224) movably mounted on said subframe, said holder being 

equipped with upper and lower doctor blades (25, 26; 125, 126; 225, 
226) engaging said roll and end seals (27, 227) defining with said 

roll a liquid chamber, and ink inlet (32, 263) and outlet (33, 266) 
means in said holder, said subframe having portions (34, 35; 134, 

135, 254, 255) 
clamping said doctor blades to said holder. 
The fountain of claim 1 in which said holder has 
upper (258) and lower (260) blade supporting surfaces, means (245, 

246) associated with each surface for temporarily holding said 
blades on said surfaces. 
The fountain of claim 2 in which said holding means 
includes magnetic means, said doctor blades being constructed of 

ferrous material. 
The fountain of claim 1 in which said subframe is 
generally C-shaped and equipped with a fluid pressure cylinder 

means (23, 123, 223) operatively coupled to said holder to unclamp 
said blades. 
The fountain of claim 1 in which pivot means (36, 
151) interconnect said subframe (22, 122) with said frame (20). 
The fountain of claim 1 in which said subframe includes 
a pair (134, 149; 254, 255) of pivotally interconnected subframe members. 
The fountain of claim 6 in which one (134) of said  
 

subframe members is equipped with rod means, and an L-shaped 
bracket (147) slidably mounted on said rod means.  

 
A method for doctor blade replacement in a fountain for a 
flexographic press according to claim 1, comprising the steps of providing a 

frame equipped with an ink transfer roll, a subframe movably mounted on 
said frame adjacent said roll, a holder movably mounted on said subframe, 

said holder being equipped with upper and lower doctor blades engaging said 
roll and end seals defining with said roll a liquid chamber, and ink inlet and 

outlet means in said holder, said subframe having portions clamping said 
doctor blades to said holder, moving said subframe away front said ink 

transfer roll and moving said holder relative to said subframe to unclamp 
said blades. 
The method of claim 8 in which said steps include providing 
said clamping portions of a length substantially the length of said doctor 

blades, and applying clamping pressure at longitudinally spaced areas of said 
clamping portions to substantially uniformly clamp said blades. 
The method of claim 9 in which said steps include providing 
said holder with means for temporarily supporting said blades until said 

subframe clamping portions are brought into clamping engagement with said 
blades.
