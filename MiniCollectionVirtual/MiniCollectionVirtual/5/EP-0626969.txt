<ABSTRACT>
Coenzyme A-independent transacylase is required for the release of free arachidonic acid, and the production of arachidonic acid metabolites and platelet activation factor. Blocking of this enzyme inhibits the production of these inflammatory mediators and will be of therapeutic utility in a broad range of allergic and inflammatory diseases and disorders. Compounds are described herein which inhibit the action of CoA-IT and are therefore useful in the treatment of disease states caused thereby.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the area of inflammatory mediators. The
invention is based on the discovery that blocking a key enzyme responsible
for arachidonate movement (or remodelling), Coenzyme A-independent
transacylase (CoA-IT), inhibits the production of lipid mediators (free
arachidonic acid, arachidonic acid metabolites, and platelet-activating
factor (PAF)). It has been discovered that CoA-IT is required for the
release of free arachidonic acid and the synthesis of arachidonic acid
metabolites and PAF. As CoA-IT is involved in arachidonate
phospholipid metabolism, and required for the release of free
arachidonic acid and the production of eicosanoids and PAF, inhibition
of such would be useful for the treatment of disease states caused thereby.An early event in the response of most inflammatory cells to
immunologic activation and other stimuli is the release of newly formed
products (mediators) which alter the function and biochemistry of
surrounding cells and tissues. The ensuing biological responses, as well
as much of the pathogenesis which is attributed to inflammation and
allergy, are thought to be dependent on the effects that these newly-formed
mediators have on adjacent cells within the inflammatory region.In the last 20 years, it has become apparent that lipid mediators are
among the most potent and important products which are generated
during inflammatory reactions. The synthesis of most lipid mediators is
initiated by the cleavage of complex phospholipid molecules which contain
arachidonate at their sn-2 position. Free arachidonic acid is released
from these phospholipids and this represents the rate-limiting step in the
formation of eicosanoids (leukotrienes, prostaglandins and
thromboxanes). As arachidonic acid is released, it is then converted to
oxygenated derivatives by at least two enzymatic systems (lipoxygenase
and/or cyclooxygenase). Concomitant with arachidonate release,
lysophospholipids are formed. One of these lyso phospholipids, 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine,
is then acetylated to form platelet-activating
factor (PAF). Each of the cell types involved in the 
inflammatory response produce and secrete a unique subset of lipid
mediators. The quantities and nature of the metabolites depend on which
enzymes and precursor phospholipid pools are available to inflammatory
cells.Once lipid mediators such as PAF and eicosanoids are formed by
the aforementioned pathways, they induce signs and symptoms observed
in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders.
