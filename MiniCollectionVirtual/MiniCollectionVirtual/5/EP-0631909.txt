<ABSTRACT>
An airbag restraint inflator assembly including a 
reaction can (10) and an inflator (12) which is shorter 

than the reaction can (10) and has a flanged base. A 
mounting device (34) and a mounting cup (48) engage holes 

in opposed end walls (20, 22) of the reaction can (10) by 
means of flanges (50). A nut (56) threaded onto a stud 

(32) on one end of the inflator (12) clamps a flat bottom 
(52) of the mounting cup (48) against the end of the 

inflator (12). The mounting device (34) includes a 
cylindrical sidewall connected by a joggle to a conical 

section (44) which frictionally engages and holds the 
flanged base of the inflator in the reaction can by biased 

radial compression force, thereby providing essentially 
rattle- and squeak-free retention of the inflator in the 

reaction can (10) in an appropriately positioned and 
centred manner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to vehicle airbag restraint 
systems 
of the kind shown in US-A-5 069 480 and more particularly to a 
reaction can of such system, with 
a mounting structure for 
mounting an inflator which is shorter than the reaction can of an 
airbag restraint assembly in the reaction can of such an 
assembly. A vehicular airbag restraint system generally includes 
a pyrotechnic inflator which may comprise a cylindrical housing 
which encloses some form of gas generating material which, when 
ignited, generates a non-toxic inert gas under pressure within 
the housing. The inflator, along with an uninflated, folded 
airbag which is to be inflated by the gas, is disposed in an 
internal cavity of a reaction can along with means to control 
deployment. In an emergency situation inert gas is generated in 
the inflator housing and the gas is directed rapidly through a 
plurality of nozzles formed in the inflator housing and into the 
airbag to force the airbag out of the reaction can to inflate the 
airbag. One location for such a vehicular airbag restraint 
system is in the instrument panel or dashboard on the passenger 
side of the vehicle for passive protection of a passenger in the 
vehicle. Some inflators are constructed with a flanged base at 
one end of the cylindrical housing. 
See for instance US-A-5 069 480 and US-A-4 153 273 concerning 
vehicle airbag restraint systems in which the inflator is longer 
than the reaction can. 
In many cases, packaging and 
weight limitations may require airbag inflators to be shorter 
than the reaction cans in which they are housed. This situation 
requires an inflator to reaction can interface that is cost 
effective, durable and squeak- and rattle-free.  
 Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to 
provide a new and improved mounting structure for mounting a 
flange based inflator, which is shorter than a reaction can, in 
the reaction can of an airbag restraint system which structure 
produces a mounting interface that is squeak and rattle resistant 
and provides a seal against the escape of gas on deployment of 
an airbag of the assembly. Another object of this invention is to provide a new 
and improved structure for mounting an inflator in a reaction can 
of a vehicle airbag restraint system which is easy to install, 
cost effective, and durable as well as squeak- and rattle-free. These objects are realized by the invention as defined in Claim 1. In carrying out this invention in one illustrative 
embodiment thereof, a mounting structure is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A reaction can (10) adapted to mount an 
inflator (12) of the type comprising a generally 

cylindrical housing (26) having a flanged base (30) at a 
first end thereof, the reaction can (10) comprising: 


first and second end walls (20, 22) and first and 
second sidewalls (16, 18) defining a cavity (14) adapted to 

receive an inflator (12); 
said first end wall (20) having inflator mounting 
means (34) provided therein, said inflator mounting means 

(34) including a right circular cylindrical shaped tube 
formed by a circular sidewall (38), said circular sidewall 

(38) extending from said first end wall (20) into said 
cavity and terminating in an inwardly tapered conical 

flange (44) sized to engage and hold the flange based first 
end of the inflator (12) in said cavity (14) by biased 

radial compression force; and 
support means in said second end wall (22) for 
securing a second end of said inflator (12). 
The reaction can (10) as claimed in claim 1 
wherein said mounting means (34) further comprises a formed 

joggle (42) in said circular sidewall (38) intermediate the 
first end wall (20) of the reaction can (10) and said 

inwardly tapered conical flange (44), said mounting means 
(34) being provided in said reaction can first end wall 

(20) with said inwardly tapered conical flange (44) adapted 
to engage and hold the inflator housing (26) by biased 

radial compression force in a manner whereby the flanged 
base (30) of said first end of said inflator securely abuts 

the formed joggle (42), thereby providing an essentially 
squeak- and rattle-free retention of said flanged base 

inflator (12) in said reaction can (10). 
The reaction can (10) as claimed in claim 1 or  
 

2 wherein the mounting means (34) is mounted in the first 
end wall (20) of the reaction can (10). 
The reaction can (10) as claimed in claim 3 
wherein the first end wall (20) has an opening with a 

diameter and the other end of the circular sidewall (38) to 
that terminating in the conical flange (44) terminates with 

a radially extending mounting flange (40) having an outer 
diameter greater than the diameter of said first end wall 

opening. 
The reaction can (10) as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein said support means in said second 

end wall comprises a shaped opening in said second end wall 
(22) which is adapted to receive a threaded stud (32) at a 

second end of said inflator (12) for mounting and securing 
said inflator (12) in said reaction can (10) by means of a 

nut (56) threaded on said stud (32). 
The reaction can (10) as claimed in claim 5 
wherein said support means in said second end wall (22)

opening in said second end wall (22), said mounting cup 

(48) having a flat bottom (52) with said shaped opening 
(54) therein for receiving said threaded stud (32) and 

an index key on the second end of said inflator whereby the 
flat bottom (52) of said mounting cup (48) is adapted to be 

clamped between said nut (56) and said second end of the 
inflator (12) for centring and retention of the inflator 

(12) in the cavity (14) of said reaction can (10). 
An airbag restraint inflator assembly 
comprising a reaction can (10) as claimed in any preceding 

claim in combination with an inflator (12) shorter in 
dimension than the reaction can (10) and comprising a 

generally cylindrical housing (26) having a flanged base  
 

(30) at a first end thereof, said inwardly tapering conical 
flange (44) engaging and holding the inflator housing (26)

An airbag restraint inflator assembly as 
claimed in claim 7 wherein said inflator housing (26) 

includes a base shroud (28) which terminates in said 
flanged base (30) and said conical flange (44) of said
