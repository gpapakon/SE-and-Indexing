<ABSTRACT>
The device for finding and/or monitoring a predetermined level of contents of a container comprises a sensor for the level of the contents of the container to be monitored which contacts the contents when the predetermined level is reached. An exciting arrangement causes the sensor to vibrate mechanically at its natural resonant frequency. An assessment circuit is used to trigger display and/or switching processes depending upon whether the frequency of the mechanical vibrations of the sensor exceeds or lies below a switching frequency. The sensor is associated with an electrical component having a characteristic bearing a definite relationship to the natural resonant frequency of the sensor. The switching frequency is set in the assessment circuit according to the value of the characteristic of the electrical component. The assessment circuit is thus automatically matched to sensors with different natural resonant frequencies. The electrical component is preferably a resistor, the resistance of which is the characteristic.

<CLAIMS>
A device for determining and/or monitoring a predetermined 
level of contents in a container, comprising a sensor 

which is so arranged on the container at the height of the 
contents level to be monitored that it comes into contact 

with the contents when the same reach the predetermined 
level, an exciting arrangement which excites the sensor to 

mechanical vibrations at its natural resonant frequency, and 
an evaluating circuit for causing display and/or switching 

operations dependent on whether the frequency of the 
mechanical vibrations of the sensor is above or below a 

switching frequency, characterized in that an electrical 
circuit element is associated with the sensor, which 

electrical circuit element has a characteristic parameter 
whose value bears an unambiguous relationship to the natural 

resonant frequency of the sensor, that the evaluating 
circuit comprises an arrangement for the conversion of the 

frequency of the mechanical vibrations of the sensor into a 
first digital number, an arrangement for the conversion of 

the value of the characteristic parameter of the circuit 
element into a second digital number, and an adding circuit 

which by addition of a fixed basic number to the second 
digital number forms a summated number which indicates the 

switching frequency, and in that the evaluating circuit 
comprises a comparator which at a first input receives the 

first digital number, at a second input receives the second 
digital number and at its output supplies an undelayed 

sensor condition signal which in accordance with the result 
of the comparison between the two digital numbers assumes 

the one or the other of two signal values.  
 
The device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that a 
delay circuit is connected with the output of the comparator 

and imparts a predetermined delay to the undelayed sensor 
condition signal supplied by the comparator and at the 

output supplies a delayed sensor condition signal, which is 
employed for triggering the display and/or switching 

operations. 
The device as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that 
the delay imparted by the delay circuit is of different 

magnitude in accordance with whether the undelayed sensor 
condition signal has the one or the other signal value. 
The device as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that 
the delay circuit is constituted by an up-down counter, 

whose direction of count is controlled by the undelayed 
sensor signal and which in a manner dependent of the 

direction of count is operated with different clock 
frequencies. 
The device as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the evaluating circuit comprises a 

sensor parameter monitoring circuit, which receives the 
first and the second digital numbers and supplies an alarm 

signal when one of the digital numbers is outside a predetermined 
range.
