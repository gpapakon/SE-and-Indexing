<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system which
connects an image input device such as a digital camera
having a plurality of operation modes, and an image
processing apparatus such as a personal computer or the
like, and inputs and saves images, its control method,
and a storage medium.Conventionally, when an image captured by a
digital camera is input to a personal computer, the
following procedure is required:
1. The camera is connected to the personal
computer via a serial cable.2. The user starts an application.3. A TWAIN driver is started from the
application.4. A button or menu command for connecting the
camera is pressed.5. Thumbnails of images in the camera are
displayed on the window of the TWAIN driver. 6. The user selects an image to be captured into
the personal computer and presses a capture button.7. The selected image is transferred to the
personal computer.In this manner, in order to capture an image in
the digital camera into the personal computer, a given
procedure is required, and the user must have certain
knowledge. Recently, an RS-232C serial cable is
prevalently used as an I/F for connecting a personal
computer and camera. This I/F has high compatibility,
i.e., is supported by all personal computers, but has
low transfer rate. With the use of this I/F, the
configuration of image input software such as a TWAIN
driver or the like has a fixed procedure for
transferring thumbnail data with a small data size
first to display image indices in the camera, and then
transferring only original images selected by the user.However, Microsoft Windows98â„¢ formally supports
USB (Universal Serial Bus) as a new I/F, and STI (Still
Image Captures Architecture and Interfaces) is prepared
as a software I/F for digital cameras. USB has a
maximum transfer rate of 10 Mbps; an original image can
be directly transferred without making the user feel
stress as long as it is a compressed file such as a
JPEG file or the like. In this manner, an environment
for allowing to readily build image input software with 
a higher degree of freedom without fixing the procedure
to that for displaying thumbnails and then transferring
only a required original image is in order.USB can implement hot plugin (a USB device can be
plugged or unplugged while a PC is running, and the OS
can recognize the plugged or unplugged state), and a
mechanism for automatically recognizing the connected
camera, and automatically starting a predetermined
application associated with the camera by the STI can
be provided. As can be seen from
