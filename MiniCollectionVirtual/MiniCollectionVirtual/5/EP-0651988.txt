<ABSTRACT>
A device (10, 110) for localized hydromassage of the body 
comprising a head which emits a stream of water in 

correspondence with one of its faces (14, 114) designed to 
be disposed facing the body of the user. The head contains 

transducer elements (15, 115, 215, 315) which introduce 
ultrasonic waves into said stream of water so as to 

produce an ultrasonic micromassaging action in the area of 
the body subjected to the stream of water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention refers to an innovative localized
hydromassaging device.There are known localized hydromassaging devices composed
of a head which dispenses jets of water, sometimes mixed
with air, which can he brought close to or into contact
with parts of the body so that the jets produce a
beneficial hydromassaging effect on the skin.The general scope of this invention is to provide an
innovative localized hydromassaging device which combines
the massaging action produced by a stream of water with a
micromassaging action produced by generation of ultrasonic
waves.This scope is achieved, according to the invention, by
providing a localized hydromassaging device for the body
comprising a head which dispenses a stream of water in
correspondence with one of its faces designed to be
disposed facing the body, the head containing transducer
elements which introduce ultrasonic waves into said stream
of water.The innovatory principles of this invention and its
advantages compared to the known technique will be more
clearly evident from the following description of possible
exemplificative embodiments applying such principles, with
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:
figure 1 shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a
first hydromassaging device made according to the 
invention;figure 2 shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a
second hydromassaging device made according to the
invention;figure 3 shows a schematic enlarged cross-sectional view
of a possible alternative embodiment of a detail of the
hydromassaging device;figure 4 shows a schematic cross-sectional view of a
further possible alternative embodiment of a detail of the
hydromassaging device;
With reference to the figures, figure 1 shows a first
device according to the invention, generically indicated
by reference 10. It comprises a casing 11 which is
internally supplied with a stream of water by means of a
connection 12 to a source of water under pressure. The
casing 11 is provided with nozzles 13, which produce jets
of water directed towards the outside of the casing. For
example, the nozzles 13 can be made in the form of a
plurality of holes in a wall 14 of the casing 11.Innovatively, disposed in contact with the stream of water
is an ultrasonic wave emitting transducer element 15
controlled by an electronic circuit 18. The term "in
contact" is used here to refer to an acoustic contact,
that is to say, transmission of ultrasounds with minimum
attenuation. For example, the transducer 15 can be a known
piezoelectric transducer. The

<CLAIMS>
Localized hydromassaging device for the body comprising a head which dispenses a stream
of water in correspondence with one of its faces designed to be disposed facing the body, the

head containing transducer elements; device characterized by the fact that said transducer
elements introduce ultrasonic waves into said stream of water in order to combine the
