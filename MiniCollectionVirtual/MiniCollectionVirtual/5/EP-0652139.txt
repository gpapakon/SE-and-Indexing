<ABSTRACT>
A method of folding a vehicle occupant restraint air bag 
cushion (10) comprising the steps of: tucking a center of 

the cushion (10) towards a mouth (24) of the air bag to 
create two overlying pleats (30,32), rolling half of the 

bag into a roll (34), folding side portions between the 
pleats (30,32) to make the overall width of the bag (10) 

substantially the same as the width of an attachment 
retainer defining the mouth (24), rolling substantially the 

remainder of the bag (10) on to the roll (34), inserting 
the roll (34) into the retainer and folding an unrolled 

loop of the bag material over the roll which loop is 
arranged to form an upwardly projected bubble prior to 

downward unrolling of the bag upon bag deployment. The 
invention also covers a bag so folded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air bag which is 
inflatable for restraining an occupant of a vehicle 
during a collision. More particularly, the invention 
relates to folding an air bag in a manner to improve the 
deployment thereof. Typically, an air bag cushion is folded and 
supported on the steering wheel or dashboard of a 
vehicle. When the air bag is to be inflated, high 
pressure gas from an inflator is caused to flow therein 
through a gas inlet opening or mouth thereof. This 
causes the air bag to unfold and inflate. Upon vehicle impact in a collision, top mounted air 
bag cushions, that is, those mounted near the top of the 
dashboard, tend to deploy high in the vehicle 
compartment and tend also to deploy with great velocity 
at the passenger's head. More specifically, as most air 
bag cushions deploy, the pressure in the cushion spikes 
to a high pressure initially. The high pressure ejects  
 
the folded cushion out of the air bag module with great 
velocity. This results in the cushion slapping the 
passenger as it unfolds. Such "slapping" of the 
passenger, particularly when an out-of-position child, 
with the cushion material could cause skin abrasions, 
excessive neck extension, and increase head injury 
criteria values. US Patent 5,290,061 (on which the pre-characterizing 
part of claim 1 is based) discloses a method 
for folding an air bag which involves first folding side 
portions of the bag inwardly then rolling all of the bag in 
a single operation towards a mouth of an inflator in which 
the roll of bag is accommodated prior to inflation. With 
this arrangement the bag can unroll away from the inflator 
completely before expansion of the bag in other directions 
occurs. Thus, there is a need and a demand for alleviating 
and/or correcting this problem so that the air bag 
cushion has a lower velocity deployment which results in 
elimination or reduction in "bag slap" injuries. An object of the invention is to provide an 
improved fold configuration for an air bag cushion that 
effects a reduction in the deployment velocity of the 
cushion and causes the cushion to deploy lower and more 
toward the vehicle occupant's midsection or torso. In order to cause the cushion to deploy lower and 
more toward the occupant's midsection, it must be 
folded in a manner such that it unfolds in along the 
rearward face of the dashboard. In order to reduce the 
velocity of the cushion deployment, the cushion must not 
unfold faster than the inflator can fill it with gas.  
 
To make the cushion

<CLAIMS>
A folded inflatable air bag cushion (10) of air bag 
fabric and having a mouth (24) for restraining a vehicle 

occupant, said air bag cushion (10) being adapted to be top 
mounted on a dashboard (20) of the vehicle and using 

several fold variations including at least some of: a 
folded bubble (38,40) on top, tucks, a pleat (30,32) and at 

least one roll (34,36) which is adapted to inversely roll 
down the dashboard (20) of the vehicle when an inflating 

fluid flows into the cushion (10), characterised in that 
the fold variations comprise: 


a. a tuck of a center (28) of the cushion (10) 
towards the mouth (24) creating overlying pleats 

(30,32), 
b. a first roll (34) of the pleats (30,32) rolled 
towards the mouth (24) and including less than all 

of the bag (10), 
c. folds of side portions of the bag (10) situated 
between the pleats (30,32), and 
d. a further roll (36) including at least a 
majority of the remainder of the bag (10) rolled 

onto the first roll (34), 
 
which folds are such that they 

can only unfold in a reverse of the sequence a 
to d and that said air bag cushion (10) does not unfold 

faster than it can be filled with inflating fluid and 
deploys relatively slowly in a downward trajectory. 
The air bag cushion (10) as claimed in claim 1 
wherein the first roll (34) includes about half of the 

fabric of the air bag cushion.  
 
The air bag cushion (10) as claimed in claim 1 or 2 
wherein the side portion folds are such as to make the 

width of the folded cushion substantially the same as the 
width of the mouth (24). 
The air bag cushion (10) as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein the further roll (36) is inserted 

into the mouth (24). 
The air bag cushion (10) as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein a loop (38) of excess air bag 

fabric is folded over the further roll (36). 
The air bag cushion (10) as claimed in any 
preceding claim wherein one pleat (30) is longer than 

the other pleat (32) and the first roll (34) includes a roll 
of the longer pleat (30) alone 

followed by a roll of the two pleats (30,32) 
where the pleats overlie.  

 
A method of folding an inflatable air bag cushion 
(10) of air bag fabric and having a mouth (24) comprising 

the following steps with the cushion initially in an 
uninflated state and unfolded: 


a. tucking the center (28) of the cushion (10) 
towards the mouth (24) creating overlying pleats 

(30,32), 
b. rolling the pleats together towards the mouth 
(24) to form a first roll (34) including less than 

all of the bag (10), 
c. folding side portions of the bag (10) between 
the pleats (30,32), and 
d. rolling at least a majority of the remainder 
of the bag (10) onto the roll (34) to form a 

further roll (36). 
The method claimed in claim 7 wherein step b is 
stopped after about half of the air bag fabric has been  

 
rolled onto the first roll (34). 
The method claimed in claim 7 or 8 wherein at the 
conclusion of step c the width of the folded cushion is 

substantially the same as the width of the mouth (24). 
The method claimed in claim 7, 8 or 9 wherein the 
further roll (36) is inserted into the mouth (24). 
The method claimed in any one claims 7 to 10 
wherein after step d a loop (38) of excess fabric is folded 

over the rolled cushion. 
The method claimed in claim 11 wherein the loop 
(38) is deployable upon initial inflation of the air bag 

(10) to form an upwardly deployable bubble (40) prior to 
downward unrolling of the rolled air bag (10). 
The method claimed in any one of claims 7 to 12 
wherein one pleat (30) is longer than the other pleat and 

(32) rolling of the longer pleat (30) is effected followed 
by inclusion of the other pleat (32) when it is met.
