<ABSTRACT>
An indirect cathode sleeve and manufacturing method thereof capable of 
substantially reducing electric power consumption of a heater disposed inside the cathode 

sleeve and simultaneously reducing a picture-producing time by making an inside surface 
of the cathode sleeve oxidized and an outside surface of the thereof reduced. 
The cathode sleeve according to the present invention includes a heater disposed 
inside the cathode sleeve; a base metal formed at the top of cathode sleeve; an electron-emitting 

material layer formed at the outside surface of the base metal; and an indirect 

cathode sleeve including a black inside surface thereof and a white outside surface 
thereof. 
The method for manufacturing an indirect cathode sleeve includes the steps of 
forming a structure of a cathode sleeve consisting of a bimetal which consist of a NickelChrome 

alloy at an inside surface of the cathode sleeve and a Nickel alloy at an outside 
surface of the cathode sleeve; oxidizing the inside surface of the cathode sleeve through 

a high temperature wet hydrogen environment; selectively etching the outside surface of 
the cathode sleeve, as a result, forming a base metal at the top of the cathode sleeve; and 

forming an electron-emitting material layer at the outside surface of the base metal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an indirectly heated cathode and
manufacturing methods thereof
capable of substantially reducing electric power
consumption of a heater which is disposed inside the cathode sleeve and simultaneously
reducing a picture-producing time by making an inside surface of the cathode sleeve
oxidized and an outside surface thereof reduced.Conventionally, with reference to Fig. 1, a hollow cathode sleeve 2 which has the
top closed, is shown. A cathode sleeve support 5 having a hollow and larger diameter
than that of the cathode sleeve 2 surrounds the cathode sleeve 2.
Predetermined upper and lower portions thereof are affixed to the outside surface of the
cathode sleeve 2. A plurality of heaters 3 are disposed inside the cathode sleeve 2 and
electrically connected with a power supply. A cap-shaped controlling electrode G1 is
fixedly disposed above but not touching the top of the cathode sleeve 2 for controlling
the on-off state of an electron beam which is generated at the cathode sleeve 2,
additionally having a hole 7 disposed at the center portion thereof with a predetermined
diameter for passing the electron beam. An upside down cap-shaped accelerating electrode
G2 is fixedly disposed above but not touching the controlling electrode G1 for
accelerating the electron beam, additionally having a hole 6 disposed at the center portion 
thereof with a predetermined diameter for passing the electron beam. Here, the outer edge
of the accelerating electrode G2 is affixed to the body(not shown) of the cathode sleeve
2. A condensing electrode G3 is disposed above but not touching the accelerating
electrode G2 for condensing the electron beam generated at the cathode sleeve 5 and
affixed to the accelerating electrode G2, additionally having a hole 8 disposed at the
center portion thereof with a predetermined diameter for condensing and passing the
electron beam which is passed through the controlling electrode G1, the accelerating
electrode G2 and the condensing electrode G3, in order.The operation of the conventional cathode sleeve 2 will now be explained.When electric power is applied to the heater 3, it becomes heated, and an electron
beam is generated due to a chemical reaction between a base metal 1 and the electron-emitting
material(not shown). The quantity of the electron beam generated is first
controlled by the controlling electrode G1. The controlled electron beam enters into the
accelerating electrode G2 through the hole 7. The electron beam that enters into the
acceler
