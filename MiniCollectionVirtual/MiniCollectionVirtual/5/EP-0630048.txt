<ABSTRACT>
Dice on a plurality of wafers are tested by programming 
a plurality of the dice, programming identification memory 

cells on each good die to identify the wafer on which the 
good die is located, storing the location of each good die in 

a file associated with the wafer on which the good die is 
located, subjecting the plurality of dice to discharge 

conditions, as by baking, accessing the identification memory 
cells on one die to determine the file associated with the 

die, loading the associated file, and testing only the good 
dice. Also, dice on a wafer are tested by identifying a 

first good die on the wafer, proceeding to the next good die 
on the wafer, programming the next good die to indicate a 

location of the preceding good die, repeating the last two 
steps until a last good die on the wafer is programmed, 

subjecting the wafer to discharge conditions, as by baking, 
identifying the last good die, testing the last 
good die, 
thereby generating a tested die, proceeding to a preceding 

die location indicated by the tested die, testing the die at 
the preceding die location, thereby generating another tested 

die, and repeating the last two steps until the first good 
die is tested.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of testing of dice on 
a wafer. Wafer sorting is a well-known process performed after 
wafer fabrication. During wafer sorting, each die on the 
wafer is electrically tested for electrical performance and 
circuit functioning. Thus, wafer sorting provides 
information on the effectiveness of the wafer fabrication 
process in producing working dice (i.e. chips) and provides 
identification of working dice which will be used in a 
subsequent packaging process. Referring now to the accompanying drawings, Figures 1A 
and 1B show a typical wafer sort process including testing of 
all dice during a second sort. As is well-known to those in 
the art, each die typically includes a plurality of memory 
cells, in this example electrically programmable read only 
memory (EPROM) cells. An EPROM cell includes a source and a 
drain region separated by a channel region. A floating gate 
is formed over the floating gate. As indicated in Figures 1A 
and 1B, all memory cells on a die are programmed in step 11 
by varying the charge on the floating gate, thereby changing 
the threshold voltage required to allow a current to flow 
between the source and drain regions. In step 12, the programming of the memory cells on the 
die is verified with a probe to ensure all memory cells 
exhibit an appropriate threshold voltage. If any of the 
memory cells on  
 
the die fail to exhibit the appropriate threshold voltage, then 
a number in a counter increments to indicate that a programming 
attempt has occured. This number in the counter is compared to 
a predetermined, maximum number of attempts set by the tester. 
If the number in the counter is less than or equal to the 
predetermined maximum number, all the memory cells on the die 
are reprogrammed. For simplicity, this comparing and 
reprogramming is included in verification step 12. Step 12 is 
typically repeated until either all the memory cells are 
satisfactorily programmed, or until the predetermined maximum 
number of attempts has been exceeded. At this time, if the die 
is "good" (i.e. all the memory cells exhibit the appropriate 
threshold voltage) as determined in step 13, the die is 
electronically inked. Electronic inking is a well-known method 
in the art in which one or more memory cells on the die are 
programmed to indicate a particular testing pattern for the 
probe in the second wafer sort (described below). If the die is 
"bad" (as determined in step 13) or after the probe programs and 
verifies the electronic inking of the
