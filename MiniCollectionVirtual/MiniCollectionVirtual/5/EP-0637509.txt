<ABSTRACT>
A tube for fuel transportation according to 
the present invention includes an innermost layer 

comprising one selected from the group consisting of 
fluorine type resins and polyamide type resins, a 

middle layer comprising a polyalkylene naphthalate 
resin, an outer layer comprising a thermoplastic resin 

or a thermoplastic elastomer, and an adhesive layer 
formed between the innermost layer and the middle 

layer. Polybutylene naphthalate may be used as the 
polyalkylene naphthalate resin. The tube for fuel 

transportation according to the present invention has 
excellent barrier action against fuels and is highly 

kink-proof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tube for
transporting fuels, and more particularly to a tube for
use as a fuel tube in vehicles such as automobiles.
The tube according to the present invention generally
has excellent barriering properties (barrier
action) against not only gasoline-based fuels, but
also mixed fuels including alcohols, and is kink-proof
to an extent that it can be used in a bent state in a
relatively small space.Tubes having a multilayer structure in which
a metal pipe, a rubber hose or a single layer tube of
nylon, and various resins are layered have conventionally
been used as tubes for transporting fuels in a
vehicle such as an automobile.On the other hand, the realization that it
may be difficult to secure an ample supply of gasoline
in the future has led to research for substitute fuels
in the place of gasoline. As one such substitute fuel,
mixed fuels in which alcohols, such as methanol, are
added to gasoline have been studied, and have already
been put to practical use. Use of methanol
as a substitute fuel has attracted much attention
because it is expected to provide an improved octane
value and contribute to the increased cleanliness of the
exhaust gas. In particular, for environmental reasons,
it is desirable to
minimize the amount of fuel to be discharged from a
vehicle. This has led to the enforcement
of increasingly strict emission regulations.
Therefore, tubes are desired which hardly permit fuels
to escape therethrough.Fuel tubes are often incorporated inside a
vehicle body so as to prevent them from being damaged in
the impact of a collision and to protect them against
flying stones, fire, etc. originating from outside the
vehicle. In such cases, it is particularly important substantially
to eliminate transmission of gas through the
fuel tube because the odor of the transmitted gas might
cause discomfort to people in the vehicle, or might
even catch fire when the concentration thereof becomes
sufficiently high.On the other hand, automobile design allows less and
less space for tubes to be incorporated, so that it is
necessary that the tubes be provided in such a manner as
to avoid other equipment in the engine housing.Moreover, as is well known, modern
vehicles are required to have improved resistance
against rust and a reduced weight in view of the demands
for increased durability and improved fuel consumption.A conventional tube for fuel transportation
is disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication
No. 4-224384. This tube for fuel transportation is a
single
