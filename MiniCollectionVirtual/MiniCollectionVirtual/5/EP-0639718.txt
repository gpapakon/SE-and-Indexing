<ABSTRACT>
The bond (2) to join hollow profiles (1), pref. of metal, has holding pockets (5) for an adhesive (4) at the bonding surfaces (3). The adhesive is open, in a carrier or encapsulated as adhesive cushions (6) to be released on assembly. The adhesive is a single component material which reacts at room temp. especially working with moisture, or it is a system containing a solvent or an aerobic or cyanacrylate, or it is a twin-component, especially an epoxy or PUR system with variable mixture ratios, or it is a heat setting epoxy film, with the encapsulating material forming a second adhesive component.

A device for connecting hollow members (1) preferably
comprising metal, also in the form of tubes, in particular for frame

production for windows, doors, facades or the like, having a connecting
element (2), in particular a corner connector, which engages into the

hollow members (1) and which has a region provided with adhesive at one
or more of its connecting surfaces (3) which bear at the inside against

the hollow members (1) to be connected, characterised in that at the
connecting surfaces (3) to be glued the connecting element (2) is

provided with receiving pockets (5) for the adhesive (4) in which, upon
mounting of the connecting element (2), the adhesive (4) is arranged in

the form of being applied to a carrier or in encapsulated form as an
adhesive pad (6), wherein the receiving pockets (5) extend transversely

with respect to the direction of insertion of the connecting element (2).
A device according to claim 1 characterised in that the
receiving pocket (5) extends on both sides to the edge of the connecting

surface (3).
A device according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that
the adhesive (4) is arranged in positively locking relationship in the

receiving pocket (5) and terminates flush with the connecting surface (3)
or projects beyond same.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in
that the edges of the receiving pocket (5), which extend transversely

with respect to the direction of insertion of the connecting element (2),
are undercut.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in
that the receiving pocket (5) has a substantially circular cross-sectional

area. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4 characterised in
that the receiving pocket is in the form of a shallow trough.
A device according to claim 6 characterised in that at its edge
which is the leading edge in the direction of insertion the receiving

pocket (5) has a receiving groove (7) for hanging therein the adhesive
pad (6) or a support strip (8) carrying the adhesive pad (6).
A device according to claim 7 characterised in that the
receiving groove (7) extends in an arcuate configuration as viewed in

cross-section.
A device according to claim 7 characterised in that the
receiving groove (7) is in the form of a receiving slot which is oriented

parallel to the connecting surface (3) and is open towards the end of the
connecting element (2).
A device according to one of claims 1 to 9 characterised in
that a plurality of receiving pockets (5) are arranged in succession in

the direction of insertion of the connecting element (2).
A device according to claim 10 characterised in that the
receiving pockets (5) are of a scale-like, corrugated or similar

structure, wherein the projections formed in the scale-like structure
between the receiving pockets (5) face in opposite relationship to the

direction of insertion.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 11 characterised in
that disposed in the connecting element (2) is a transversely extending

pin (9) which opens into the receiving pocket (5) and which is axially
displaceable into the receiving pocket (5) from the side remote

therefrom. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in
that the adhesive (4) is formed by a one-component system reacting at

ambient temperature, in particular a system which cross-links under the
effect of moisture or a solvent-bearing system or an anaerobic system or

a cyanoacrylate-bearing system.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in
that the adhesive (4) is formed by a two-component system reacting at

ambient temperature, in particular an epoxy or PUR-system with a variable
mixing ratio.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 12 characterised in
that the adhesive (4) is formed by a hot-hardening epoxy foil or a micro-encapsulated

adhesive or an acrylate system or a hot adhesive.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 15 characterised in
that the adhesive pad (6) has a plastics sheathing.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 16 characterised in
that the adhesive pad ( 6) is of a wedge-shaped cross-sectional shape

which increases in size in the direction of insertion of the connecting
element (2).
A device according to claim 16 or claim 17 characterised in
that the adhesive pad (6) has an intermediate foil (11) separating the

two components of a two-component adhesive.
A device according to claim 18 characterised in that the
intermediate foil (11) has circular or comb-like zones (12) which permit

or faciliate the transfer of adhesive.
A device according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in
that the adhesive pad (6) is formed by a felt impregnated with the

adhesive (4). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 14 characterised in
that the adhesive (4) is applied to an aluminium foil forming a carrier.
