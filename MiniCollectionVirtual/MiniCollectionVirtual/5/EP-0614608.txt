<ABSTRACT>
Blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides) populations may develop a reduced sensitivity to herbicidal active substances if this group of active substances is used frequently. The application relates to herbicidal compositions which are characterised by an effective content of at least one compound from the group containing the compounds fenoxaprop or fenoxaprop-P or their esters, and propinyl 2-[4-(5-chloro-5-fluoro-2-pyridinyloxy)phenoxy]propionate in combination with at least one compound from the group containing the compounds cycloxydim, metribuzin, haloxyfop or their esters as well as isoproturon.

<CLAIMS>
A herbicidal composition which comprises a
synergistically active content of


A1) fenoxaprop or fenoxaprop-P; ((±) or (2R)-2-[4-(6-chlorobenzoxasol-2-yloxy)phenoxy]propionic

acid
(formula I)) or an ester of these



in combination with
B) cycloxydim; ((±)-2-[1-(ethoxyimino)butyl]-3-hydroxy-5-thian-3-ylcyclohex-2-enone,

formula III)

A composition as claimed in claim 1 which
additionally comprises at least one compound selected

from the group consisting of the compounds 

A2) propynyl (2-[4-(5-chloro-5-fluoro-2-pyridinyloxy)phenoxy]propionate

(formula II)

B2) metribuzin; (4-amino-6-tert-butyl-3-methylthio-4H-[1,2,4]-triazin-5-one,

formula IV)

B3) haloxyfop; (2-[4-[3-chloro-5-trifluoromethyl]-2-pyridyl]
oxyphenoxypropionic
acid, formula V)



or an ester thereof and
B4) isoproturon (3-(4-isopropylphenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea,
formula 

VI)

A composition as claimed in claim 1 which
comprises 1 to 99% by weight of a composition as claimed

in claim 1 in addition to customary formulating agents.
A method for the preparation of a composition as
claimed in one or more of claims 1 and 2, which

comprises formulating the composition as for a customary
crop protection formulation selected from the group

consisting of wettable powders, emulsifiable
concentrates, aqueous solutions, emulsions, sprayable

solutions (tank mix), oil- and water-based dispersions,
suspoemulsions, dusts, seed-dressing products, soil

granules, granules for spreading, water-dispersible
granules, ULV formulations, microcapsules or waxes.
A method of controlling undesired plants, which
comprises applying an effective amount of a composition

as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3 to these
plants or the areas on which they are grown.
The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein
blackgrass is controlled selectively in crops.
The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the
crop is wheat.
The use of the herbicidal composition as claimed
in one or more of claims 1 to 3 for selective weed

control in crops.
