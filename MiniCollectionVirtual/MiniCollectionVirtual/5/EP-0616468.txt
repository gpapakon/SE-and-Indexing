<ABSTRACT>
A video signal processing system for outputting an EDTV 
signal from which an accompanying auxiliary signal is 

removed when the auxiliary signal of the inputted EDTV 
signal hh' is in the base-band frequency. The system 

includes an auxiliary signal period detection circuit (6-12) for 
outputting a detection signal "g" by detecting auxiliary 

signal periods dd11 and dd22 corresponding to the auxiliary 
signals dd1' and dd2' in the base band frequency and a 

mute circuit 4 for muting the EDTV signal in the auxiliary 
signal periods dd11 and dd22 in response to the auxiliary 

signal detection signal "g".

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a video signal processing 
system. Prior arts will be described with reference to Fig. 4 
which is useful to explain an image of a letter box system 
and Fig. 5 which shows a signal format for the EDTV 
(Extended Definition Television) system. A transmission system for transmitting a high quality 
image having a display screen aspect ratio of 16 : 9, which 
is compatible with a conventional "television receiver" 
(hereinafter referred to as "TV receiver") having a screen 
aspect ratio of 4 : 3, has been studied. One of such 
transmission systems is the so-called letter box system in 
which, when an image is displayed on a screen of a 
conventional TV receiver, black portions are displayed on an 
upper region and a lower region of the displayed picture and 
the image information is displayed on a vertical center with 
an aspect ratio of 16 : 9, as shown in Fig. 5 and, when it 
is displayed on a screen of an EDTV receiver which is 
capable of reproducing an image having an aspect ratio of 16 
: 9 filling the same aspect ratio screen, two auxiliary 
signals dd1 and dd2 corresponding to two vertical high  
 
frequency components or two horizontal high frequency components 
or a vertical high frequency component and a horizontal 
high frequency component are inserted into the black 
portions of the image. In Fig. 5, cc indicates a picture 
signal of image information. For the auxiliary signals dd1 
and dd2. modulation scheme have been considered to be so-called 
the VSB-modulation (vestigial side band modulation) 
obtained by restricting its carrier or digital encoding. 
These signals are illustrated in Fig. 5 and will be referred 
to as the EDTV signal hereinafter. In order to identify such 
EDTV signal, an EDTV identification signal bb is inserted 
into a predetermined scanning line within a vertical blanking 
period as shown in Fig. 5. And, when the auxiliary 
signals dd1 and dd2 are absent, a constant black level is 
present in the auxiliary signal periods dd11 and dd22. An example of such EDTV signal is the "PAL plus" system 
which is under consideration in Europe. When such EDTV signal is to be recorded and reproduced 
in a conventional magnetic video signal recording and reproducing 
apparatus (referred to as "VTR" hereinafter), it 
pauses a problem that the auxiliary signals dd1 and dd2 of 
the EDTV signal can not be decoded by a decoder for obtaining 
high quality image due to the following problems (1) to 
(3) for reasons that in such a conventional VTR, the input

<CLAIMS>
A video signal processing system for processing various 
types of video signals including an EDTV signal containing a 

picture signal indicative of image information and an 
auxiliary signal related to the picture signal, the auxiliary 

signal being time-division multiplexed with the picture 
signal, comprising: 

   an auxiliary signal period detection means for outputting 
a detection signal by detecting a period of said 

auxiliary signal residing in a base-band frequency when said 
EDTV signal inputted to the video signal processing system 

contains said auxiliary signal being in the base-band 
frequency; and 

   muting means for muting said EDTV signal in said period 
of the auxiliary signal in the base-band frequency in 

response to said detection signal.
