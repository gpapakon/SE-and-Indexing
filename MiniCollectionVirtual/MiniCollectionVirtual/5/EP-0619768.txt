<ABSTRACT>
In the method proposed, areas of the surfaces of plates made of glass or similar material are abraded by blast-cleaning or etching. The size of the abraded area can be selected to include the whole of the plate surface. Selection of the surface to be abraded is done, in particular, by masking the rest of the surface with, in the case of blast-cleaning, a rubber-like material. The method is particularly suitable for use in recycling plates made of glass or similar material with a decorated surface. In such cases, the plate is first processed by the method proposed (52), its surface subsequently buffed, polished or ground and, finally, a new decorative design produced on the surface, using the method (50).

Method for recycling surface decorated plates of 
glass or other glass-like material, particularly plates 

as used for cooking utensils, for example hot plate 
surfaces, oven doors, front panels, characterized by 

the following steps: 

a) for the ablation of surface areas of selectively 
variable size, up to complete ablation, the plate 

surface is irradiated with particles or etched. 
b) then, the surface is lapped, polished or cut. 
c) next, for the ablation of surface areas of 
selectively variable size, up to complete ablation, the 

surface is irradiated with particles or etched. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in 
that in step a) the irradiation with particles or the 

etching is carried out substantially at the same time 
on the entire surface, with the surface areas that are 

not to be treated remaining substantially unmasked. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that steps a) and c) are carried out at the same 

processing station, in case of sand-blasting or glazing 
at the same blasting station. 
Surface treatment facility for surface decorated 
plates of glass or other glass-like material, 

particularly plates as used for cooking utensils, 
including a particle irradiation chamber or an etching 

station and a device for carrying the plates through 
the particle irradiation chamber or the etching 

station, characterized by the fact that the outlet of 
the particle irradiation chamber or the etching station 

is followed by a station for secondary treatment, such 
as a polishing, cutting or lapping station, the outlet  

 
of which is returned to the entry of the particle 

irradiation chamber or the etching station.
