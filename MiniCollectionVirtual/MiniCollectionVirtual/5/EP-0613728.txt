<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a foam dispensing pump 
container for foaming a foamable liquid product such as 
shampoo, hand soap, cleaning solutions, hair-care product or 
shaving cream by depressing a nozzle member fixed to an upper 
end of a piston member of the container and pumping the 
foamable liquid with air into a mixing chamber, mixing the 
foamable liquid with the air in the mixing chamber, and 
homogenizing the foam through a porous member such as a net 
member and dispensing the homogenized foam from the nozzle 
member to the outside of the container. The applicant has proposed several foam dispensing pump 
containers of the aformentioned type as disclosed in 
International patent application publication No. WO 92/08657

of claim 1. In these publications there is disclosed a foam 
dispensing pump container comprising: a double cylinder which 
is provided inside an opening portion of a container 
containing a liquid and which is constituted by an air  
 
cylinder and a liquid cylinder, both being arranged 
concentrically; a dip tube extending from a bottom portion of 
the liquid cylinder to a bottom portion of the container; a 
piston body constituted by air and liquid pistons, both 
pistons being arranged concentrically and integrally to move 
up and down in the air and liquid cylinders respectively; a 
hollow bent nozzle member provided at an upper end of the 
piston body and having nose portion, a stem and a foam 
passage; and air passage formed in an upper gap between the 
liquid piston and the air piston for allowing the foam path 
and an interior of the air cylinder to communicate with each 
other; a liquid passage formed in the liquid piston for 
allowing the foam passage and an interior of the liquid 
cylinder to communicate with each other; a second check valve 
disposed in an upper end of the liquid passage; a first check 
valve disposed at the lower end of the liquid cylinder; 
sheet-shaped porous members disposed in a mixing chamber 
communicating with the air passage and the liquid passage and 
in the foam passage downstream of the mixing chamber; an 
urging spring for urging the piston body upwardly to a top 
dead position with respect to the double cylinder; an air 
hole formed in the air cylinder to introduce an outer air 
outside the container into the container; and a lid member 
for fixing the double cylinder to the container
