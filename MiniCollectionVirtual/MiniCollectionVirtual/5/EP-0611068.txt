<ABSTRACT>
A plug-in circuit card assembly for mounting high power electrical and 
optical components. The apparatus comprises a printed wiring circuit (120) 

mounting high power electrical and optical components and connectors with 
conducting paths interconnecting the components and ones of the components with 

the connectors (123, 124). The assembly has a structure attached to the printed 
wiring circuit with a heat sink (102) formed at one end and having a pair of plates 

(100, 110) extending outward therefrom. One plate (110) mounts a plurality of high 
thermal conducting pedestals (111) each engaging corresponding ones of the 

components. Vent tubes (101) are positioned between the plates with each vent tube 
having one end engaging one of the pedestals (111) and an opposite end engaging 

the heat sink (102) and functions to conduct heat from the components to 
the heat sink for dissipation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a circuit card assembly and in particular to a 
circuit card assembly for mounting high power electrical and optical components. Electrical and electronic equipment is oftentimes constructed of circuit 
card assemblies mounting components and which are installed in and interconnected 
by plug-in circuit card assembly mounting apparatus to form the equipment. 
Typically, the plug-in circuit card assembly mounting apparatus is constructed with 
rows of shelves wherein each shelf is open at the front and arranged to receive a 
number of plug-in circuit card assemblies. The back of each shelf may have a 
printed wiring backplane structure arranged to receive each plug-in circuit card 
assembly and interconnect the installed circuit card assemblies to form the 
electrical and electronic equipment. Components mounted on a circuit card assembly generate heat which 
must be dissipated to insure proper operation of the circuit card assembly and other 
circuit card assemblies installed in the mounting apparatus. In low power equipment 
applications, the shelves may be sufficiently spaced apart to allow the component 
generated heat to dissipate in the space among the shelves. Higher power 
equipment requires that cooling fans be installed in the circuit card assembly 
mounting apparatus to dissipate the component generated heat. In yet higher 
power equipment, cooling water is required to circulate throughout the mounting 
apparatus to cool installed circuit card assemblies. The technological advance of equipment design results in components 
that have a multitude of electrical circuits that are reduced in size to fit into a 
component and which electrical circuits operate at a sufficient high power to 
generate a large amount of heat. A problem arises in that new types of components, in addition to 
generating more heat, are smaller in size thereby allowing more components to be 
mounted on a circuit card assembly and thereby cause more heat to be generated by 
the circuit card assembly. Accordingly, a need exists for a circuit card assembly 
having a structure arranged to transfer heat generated by components mounted 
on the circuit card assembly to a common heat sink arranged to dissipate the 
component generated heat.  
 GB-A-2 252 451 discloses a circuit card assembly having a printed 
wiring circuit mounting a plurality of components and connectors, and having 
conducting paths interconnecting ones of the components, and ones of the 
components with the connectors. US 4,468,717
