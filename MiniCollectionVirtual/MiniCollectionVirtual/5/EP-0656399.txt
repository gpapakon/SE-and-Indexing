<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
production of halogenated phthalocyanine. More 
specifically, it relates to a process for the production of 
halogenated phthalocyanine, in which the halogenation is 
carried out easily, the solvent used can be easily recovered 
and the amount of a residual metal can be decreased. Generally, phthalocyanine has been industrially 
halogenated by a method in which phthalocyanine is 
halogenated while it is dissolved in a eutectic salt of 
aluminum chloride and sodium chloride or a method in which 
phthalocyanine is halogenated while it is dissolved in 
chlorosulfonic acid. In these methods, however, it is 
industrially difficult to recover the solvent, and as a 
result, a large amount of an acidic effluent is caused. For 
environmental protection, the effluent should be treated, 
and a large cost is required for the treatment. As a 
halogenation method using a recoverable solvent in order to 
cope with the above problem, there have been disclosed 
methods using a metal chloride as a solvent. For example, 
JP-A-52-29819 and U.S. Patent 4,948,884 disclose a method of 
halogenating phthalocyanine in a titanium tetrachloride as a 
solvent. Further, like titanium tetrachloride, tin 
tetrachloride can be used as a solvent, and other metal 
chlorides which are in a liquid state at room temperature 
can be also similarly used. However, in these halogenation 
methods using a metal chloride as a solvent, the solvent 
react with a small amount of water contained in air to cause 
corrosive hydrochloric acid gas together with white fumes,  
 
and the halogenation is therefore not a facile operation. 
Therefore, the above methods are not advantageous in 
industry. Further, another problem is that these solvents 
leave a small amount of a metal in a pigment which is an end 
product, and it is technically very difficult to remove the 
residual metal. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a process for the production of a halogenated 
phthalocyanine, in which a solvent can be easily recovered. It is another object of the present invention to 
provide a process for the production of a halogenated 
phthalocyanine of which the residual metal amount is 
decreased. According to the present invention, the above 
objects and advantages can be achieved by a process for the 
production of a halogenated phthalocyanine, comprising 
forming a complex of aluminum chloride and phthalocyanine 
in a halogenated hydrocarbon and then halogenating the 
phthalocyanine. The
