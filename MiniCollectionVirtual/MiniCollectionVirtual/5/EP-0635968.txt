<ABSTRACT>
A device for converting the light signals of a flat object which is located on an object carrier (21,21a,21b) and which essentially extends in one object plane, into video signals by means of a CCD sensor (32,32a,32b) arranged on a carrier and an optical device exhibiting an objective (35,35a,35b) which defines a beam path with an optical axis (30,30a,30b) and can be adjusted for imaging the object on the CCD sensor (32,32a,32b), the optical device exhibiting a controllable beam displacement device (217,219;317,319) for an optional plane-parallel displacement of the light beams impinging on the CCD sensor (32a,32b) along the plane of its sensor surface so that image information which, without light beam displacement, would fall into ineffective gaps between adjoining sensitive sensor surfaces of the CCD sensor, impinges on sensitive sensor surfaces.

<CLAIMS>
Device for converting into video signals the light signals of a flat object which
is provided on an object carrier (21; 21a; 21b) and extends substantially in an

object plane, by means of a CCD sensor (32; 32a; 32b) arranged on a carrier
and by means of an optical system comprising a lens unit (35; 35a; 35b),
 said
unit defining a raypath with an optical axis (30; 30a; 30b) and being adjustable

for imaging the object on the CCD sensor (32; 32a; 32b), 
characterized in
that
 the optical system comprises controllable beam displacement means
(217, 219; 317, 319) which, via an actuator (219; 319), cause the light beams

impinging upon the CCD sensor (32a; 32b) to be optionally displaced in
plane-parallel fashion along the plane of its sensor surface so that image

information which would drop into ineffective gaps between adjacent sensitive
sensor surfaces of said CCD sensor impinge upon sensitive surfaces of said

sensor.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the beam displacement
means (217; 317) comprise at least one plane-parallel optical plate which is

arranged at an inclination with respect to the direction of the raypath.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the displacement means
(217; 317) comprise a plurality of plane-parallel plates which are inclined

relative to the raypath at different angles and/or in different directions, one of
said plates being optionally selectible by movement of said beam

displacement means via the actuator (219; 319).
Device according to claim 3, characterized in that the beam displacement
means (217, 317) are configured as a wheel which carries the plane-parallel 

plates in sections concentric relative to its axis of rotation and which is
rotatable into desired rotary positions by means of the actuator (219, 319).
