<ABSTRACT>
A magnetic resonance apparatus comprises a primary 
gradient coil assembly (22) which is mounted in the bore of 

a vacuum dewar (18) that surrounds a toroidal 
superconducting magnet assembly (10). A pair of end ring 

assemblies (38) are supported by the gradient coil assembly 
(22). A plurality of removable radio frequency coil 

element assemblies (40) are selectively attachable to and 
removable from the gradient coil assembly. Each of the RF 

coil element assemblies has a dielectric housing (50), a 
longitudinally extending conductor element (52), electrical 

connectors (44), and circuit components (54) which connect 
the longitudinal conductor element with the electrical 

connectors. The connectors are electrically connected, at 
radio frequencies, with the ring assemblies. A mechanical 

interlock (60) mechanically locks and selectively releases 
the removable RF coil element assemblies to the gradient 

coil assembly. Sets of different removable RF coil 
element assemblies may be provided with different effective 

radii, i.e. different physical displacements of the 
electrical conductor elements from the gradient coil 

assembly, and/or different resonance frequencies to adapt 
the different sets of removable RF coil element assemblies 

for different imaging applications. The removable RF coil 
element assemblies may be completely removed when specialty 

RF coils, such as a head coil, biplanar gradient coil, or 
surface coil are to be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic resonance
apparatus. It finds particular application in
conjunction with magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and
will be described with particular reference thereto.Heretofore, magnetic resonance imagers have commonly
included a series of annular resistive or superconducting
magnets. Vacuum dewars in superconducting magnets and
housing structures of resistive magnets have defined a
central, longitudinal bore within which the subject was
received. Commonly, a series of gradient magnetic field
coils were mounted to a cylindrical dielectric former which
was mounted in the magnet bore, reducing the patient
receiving diameter. A whole body RF coil was mounted on
another dielectric former which was mounted in the interior
bore of the gradient coil dielectric former, further
reducing the patient receiving diameter.The diameter reductions become more critical when
self-shielded gradient coils are used. With self-shielded
gradient coils, there are two sets of gradient coils
disposed in a spaced relationship. The pair of gradient
coil sets produce magnetic fields which (1) sum within the
bore to create the desired magnetic field gradients and (2)
subtract outside the bore. The subtraction zeroes the
field to inhibit magnetic field gradient pulses from
inducing eddy currents in the main magnet and associated
structures. To achieve this shielding effect efficiently, 
a significant minimum spacing between the primary and
secondary gradient coils is required. Analogously, an RF
shield is advantageously disposed between the RF coil and
the gradient coils to prevent the RF pulses from inducing
eddy currents in the gradient coils. Again, a significant,
minimum spacing between the RF coils and the RF shield is
required.A large patient aperture is advantageous. A
large patient receiving bore not only accommodates large
patients and provides a less claustrophobic environment,
but it also allows imaging of portions of the subject
further from the center of the bore. For example, shoulder
imaging requires the patient's shoulders to be displaced
radially inward from the RF coil. On the other hand, a
large patient aperture has associated costs such as a
reduced sensitivity of the RF body coil, a lower gradient
performance, and more costly magnets.RF coil assemblies are shown in EP-A-0 177 855 and EP-A-0 135 326.Mounting the RF body coil to a continuous
dielectric cylindrical former reduces the patient receiving
diameter to that of the former. In a birdcage-type RF
coil, there are typically a
