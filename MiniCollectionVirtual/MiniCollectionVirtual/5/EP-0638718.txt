<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor-driven
control valve which is employed in an exhaust gas
recirculating control device for an internal combustion
engine, according to the preambles of
claim 1 or 4, respectively.There have been motor-driven control valves which are
employed in an exhaust gas recirculating control device
for an internal combustion engine, as disclosed in
Japanese Unexamined Utility Model No. 136680/1987 and
Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 238162/1990.An exhaust gas recirculating control valve requires
valve opening and closing forces above certain levels,
and at the same time a quick response of valve which is
necessary for the controllability of valve, since the
valve receives the pressure of exhaust gas in closing the
valve and in order that the recirculation of exhaust gas
is firmly controlled by firmly operating the valve
resisting against deposits adhered to a valve seat face,
deposits adhered to its bearing portion or the like. 
Further, the valve should be provided with a structure
having a facilitated integrating performance in the
integrating operation of the control valve in mass
production.The conventional motor-driven control valve is
grossly classified into two kinds in view of the
structure of the valve. One is a pushing type control
valve wherein the valve is pushed to open, and the other
is a pulling type control valve wherein the valve is
pulled to open.Figure 8 shows an example of a pushing type control
valve which is similar to that disclosed in Japanese
Unexamined Utility Model Publication No. 136680/1987.In Figure 8, a housing 1 is provided with an input
port 2 communicating with an exhaust system, not shown,
of an engine, an output port 3 communicating with an
intake system, not shown, and a recirculation passage 4.
A valve seat 6 is press-fitted into the recirculation
passage 4. Reference numeral 9 designates a bush which
is a bearing and 8, a holder for preventing invasion of
deposits into the bush, which is interposed between the
housing 1 and the valve seat 6, coaxially with the valve
seat 6.Numeral 5 designates a valve, which is disposed to
contact the valve seat 6, and is fixed to a valve shaft 7
by a calking structure or the like. The valve shaft 7
penetrates the bush 9, the other end of which is fixed to 
a spring holder A10 by a calking structure or the like.
Numeral 12 designates a spring A which is contracted
between the spring holder 10 and the housing 1 whereby
the valve 5 is urged in a valve-closing direction.Numeral 20 designates a
