<ABSTRACT>
A small boat intended to receive semiconductor wafers in vertical position. This boat comprises a cradle (20) in the form of a hollow half-cylinder with a horizontal axis; two grooved plates (21a, 21b) arranged against the side walls of the cradle (20) for receiving the wafers of semiconductor to be processed, these two plates being independent from one another and bearing on the cradle without being attached thereto; and a horizontal plate (23) allowing the two grooved plates to be supported and acting as a removable guide during the loading of the semiconductor wafers.

<CLAIMS>
A boat for vertically holding semiconductor 
wafers, characterized in that it includes: 


a cradle (20) made of a hollow half cylinder with a 
horizontal axis; and 
two grooved plates (21a, 21b), disposed against the 
lateral walls of said cradle (20) accommodating the 

semiconductor wafers to be treated, said two plates 
(21a, 21b) being independent and abutting against the 

cradle without being fastened thereto. 
The boat of claim 1, characterized in that it 
further includes a horizontal plate (23) for maintaining 

said two lateral grooved plates (21a, 21b) and 
serving as a removable guide during the loading of the 

semiconductor wafers. 
The boat of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that 
the various parts are made of quartz, silicon carbide, 

polycrystalline silicon or alumina. 
The boat of claim 2, characterized in that the 
width of the guide (23) is selected as a function of 

the diameter of the wafers to be treated and as a function 
of the free height (h‚ÇÅ) that it is desired to 

leave between the base of said wafers and the bottom of 
the cradle (20). 
The boat of claim 1, characterized in that it 
is placed in various supports, such as a pallet, a 

chute or a counter-tube having an identical or a different 
diameter. 
The boat of claim 1, characterized in that said 
cradle further comprises supporting legs that allow it 

to be directly used.
