<ABSTRACT>
A catheter for treating body cavities, especially in surgery on the ethmoid bone or the frontal sinus, is designed as a balloon-tipped catheter which is introduced into the body cavity from the outside and is filled with a fluid via a feed line. In particular, for use in surgical procedures on the ethmoid bone or frontal sinus, traumatology of the base of the skull, tumour surgery and reconstruction of shallow brain cavities, the balloon-tipped catheter is adapted as an anatomically shaped balloon to suit the shape of the particular body cavity. In comparison with a tamponade of ointment strips, which is susceptible to infection, the catheter according to the invention can remain in the body cavity for several weeks without there being any danger of infection or adhesion.

A device (10) to tampon bone-enclosed body cavities and ducts and to 
maintain them accessible after surgical manipulation, said device 

comprising a balloon (1) which is of elastic material and can be introduced 
into the body cavity and filled with the fluid from the outside, and further 

comprising a fluid supply means (5) which can be conducted out of the 
body cavity, said supply means being connected at its one end with the 

balloon (1) and being connectable at its other end with a fluid reservoir, 
wherein, when the balloon (1) is filled with fluid, the outer contour 

thereof is adapted to the inner contour of the body cavity, said device 
being characterized in that the balloon (1) is designed so as to be a 

catheter showing an anatomically idealized form, wherein said balloon (1) 
has a cuneiform shape in order to be adapted to the human frontal sinus or 

ethmoid sinus and comprises a conical connector (4) which maintains a 
sufficiently broad orifice open so that the balloon can be removed. 
The device of claim 1, characterized in that the balloon (1) is made of an 
extendable silicon elastomer. 
The device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the balloon (1) 
which, under tensile load, is developed so as to be stretchless but non-resistant 

to bending. 
The device according to claim 3, characterized in that the stretchless 
surface (3) is made of a silicon elastomer, in which there is embedded an 

insert of a stretchless fiber tissue.  
 
The device of claim 4, characterized in that the insert is made of a 
polyester. 
The device of claim 4, characterized in that the insert is made of a 
Dacron-reinforced tissue. 
The device of one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the connector (4) 
runs with an angle of about 60Â° with respect to the stretchless surface (3). 
The device of one of claims 3 to 7, characterized in that, by virtue of its 
adaptation to the lengthwise oval skull-base, the stretchless surface (3) is 

developed as a lengthwise oval supporting surface. 
The device of one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the balloon (1) is 
connected with a thin feeding pipe for inflation and evacuation of air. 
The device of claim 9, characterized in that the connector (4) is made of 
reinforced material.
