<DESCRIPTION>

 Dispersion strengthened   mcehanically-   
 alloyed aluminium-based alloy
 The present invention relates to an aluminiumbased, dispersion-strengthened, mechanically alloyed, alloy.


 Considerable research efforts have been expended to develop high strength aluminium alloys which would satisfy the demands of advanced design in aircraft, automotive and electrical industries. There are well known alloys in the 2000 and 7000 series which have high strength, but they do not exhibit the required combination of properties for certain applications.


For example, advanced aircraft material needs are for an aluminium alloy exhibiting the strength of alloy 7075 in the T6 temper, but having greater corrosion resistance. However thermal treatments which strengthen alloy 7075 to the T6 temper produce a susceptibility to stress-corrosion cracking. Al-Cu-Mg alloys in the 2000 series have been developed which have good fatigue strength, but generally, alloys in the 2000 series are weaker than 7000 series alloys and they are also less resistant to stress corrosion. In other words, the improvement of a single property by itself does not necessarily mean that an alloy will be useful. Rather groups of properties must be considered.
Thus, to improve the load carrying capabilitv of an aircraft structural member, allowing reduction of load carrying area and in turn reducing the weight of part, the properties of interest are tensile yield strength, notched fatigue resistance, fracture toughness, fatigue crack growth rate, and resistance to stress corrosion cracking.


 Tensile yield strength (YS) is the primary design factor for determining the stress loading for a structural member. Normally, maximum anticipated flight loads for a member are specified as a percentage such as 40% or 60% of the YS. Thus the greater the YS,  the smaller the cross sectional area of the structural member may be. Tensile ductility is another important material parameter. It is the practice of the aircraft designers to specify an acceptable elongation, commonly 5% minimum. For conventional aluminium alloys the tensile ductility decreases as the tensile yield strength increases and this lack of ductility may limit the   design    potential in high strength areas. Notched fatigue resistance is the alloy resistance to cyclic loading in the presence of notches or cracks.
Discontinuities in aircraft structures (e.g. rivet, holes, joints, notches, filleted corners, etc.) act so as to magnify the applied load at the discontinuity. Moreover the loads
