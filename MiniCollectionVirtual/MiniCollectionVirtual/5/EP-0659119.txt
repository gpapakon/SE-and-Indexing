<ABSTRACT>
A method of making a light sensitive printing plate, such as might be used in lithography, comprises creating a surface layer on substrate base material by depositing particulate coating material on the base material using a dry deposition technique, the surface layer being formed from particles whose size is less than about 15 (my)m, and creating an image layer on the deposited surface layer so that the surface layer is located intermediate the base material and the image layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a light sensitive printing plate and 
to a method of making a printing plate. Such plates might be 
used, for example, in lithographic printing processes. Lithographic processes involve establishing image (printing) 
and non-image (non-printing) areas on a substrate, 
substantially on a common plane. When such processes are used 
in the printing industries, non-image areas are generally 
hydrophilic, and image areas are generally oleophilic. 
Consequently, oil based inks are repelled from the non-image 
areas after water has been applied to the substrate. Image and non-image areas can be created by processes which 
include a step of exposing a layer of image material on the 
surface of the substrate to radiation. The exposure to 
radiation creates solubility differences in the image material 
corresponding to image and non-image areas. Following 
development, the soluble areas are removed, leaving a pattern 
on the substrate corresponding to the image. Preparation of the substrate for receiving a layer of the image 
material must ensure that the material bonds to the substrate, 
at least prior to image formation. However, it must allow 
release of the soluble image material after development. Suitable image materials for use in lithographic processes can 
include those based on diazonium/diazide materials, polymers 
which undergo depolymerisation or addition photo-polymerisation, 
and silver halide gelatin assemblies. Examples of 
suitable materials are disclosed in GB-1592281, GB-A-2031442, 
GB-A-2069164, GB-A-2080964, GB-A-2109573 and EP-A-377589. Substrates used in the printing industry commonly comprise an 
aluminium base layer, which has a layer of aluminium oxide on 
its surface, intermediate the base material and a subsequently  
 
applied image layer, resulting from a controlled oxidation 
reaction conducted electrochemically. Prior to the oxidation 
reaction, the surface of the aluminium base layer is subjected 
to a cleaning treatment, for example involving washing with 
alkali. The base layer is then subjected to a texture control 
treatment, for example involving an etching process, which 
increases the surface area of the substrate, which in turn 
controls the strength of the bond between the substrate and the 
image material and increases the ability of the substrate to 
hold water. It can be appropriate in some circumstances to 
modify the characteristics of the surface coating of aluminium 
oxide in order to ensure that the strength of the bond between
