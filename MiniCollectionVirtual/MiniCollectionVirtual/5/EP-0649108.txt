<ABSTRACT>
A data storage apparatus has a data memory (14) for 
storing schedule data. The schedule data includes date 

data, schedule contents data and pictorial symbol data 
representing schedule contents. When the schedule data 

is searched, pictorial symbols are read out from the 
schedule data stored in the data memory (14) and the 

read-out pictorial symbols are displayed. If one of the 
displayed pictorial symbols is selected, the schedule 

data associated with the selected pictorial symbol is 
read out and displayed on a display (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a data storage apparatus for storing data relating to
a personal schedule as set forth in the preamble of claim 1.In prior art data storage and retrieval systems it is known to
associate symbols with data items and to use said symbols
for performing retrieval operations.EP-A-0558054 discloses an image filing method and apparatus in which
a plurality of images are registered one-by-one, and the registered images are retrieved
by adding a retrieval condition to simplify registration and retrieval. A plurality of symbols
for featuring the objects in the images are set in advance, and the images are registered
to correspond to the selected symbols. At the point of image retrieval, the applicable
symbols are selected from the total number of symbols, and the images corresponding to
the selective symbols are read out. As the total number of symbols are presented for
selection at the instant of retrieval, the user is unable to discover which symbols are
assigned to registered images and which ones are not.From EP-A-0358301, a calendar display device with pictorial symbols is known,
comprising a keyboard for inputting or designating a date, schedule, pictorial symbol,
calendar display or the like. This device includes a processor for making a calendar, a
memory for storing a pictorial symbol having a specified meaning, a schedule on the
basis of a day inputted on the keyboard and a calendar made by the processor. It further
comprises a display for displaying a schedule, calendar or the like. The memory stores a
specified date and a specified pictorial symbol, designated by the keyboard relatively to
each other and the display includes a device for displaying the specified pictorial symbol
near the specified date in the calendar. The device comprises a calendar function only,
i.e. the days of the weeks or months of the year are shown along with the applicable
pictorial symbols. It is, however, not possible to conduct a search operation on the basis
of an inputted pictorial symbol. In a conventional electronic memory apparatus such
as a personal electronic notebook, data such as schedule
data, which is stored in an internal memory by a user's
key input in advance, is searched in the following
manner.A desired date is input by a character key operation
and a "Search" key is operated. Thus, date data
corresponding to the input date is searched in the
memory and schedule data associated with the searched
date data is displayed.If a part of schedule data is input as a keyword by
a character
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A data storage apparatus, having a display means (15), an input
means (12) for entering schedule data wherein each schedule data entry contains a plurality of data

items, at least one of the data items being a pictorial symbol data, and a
data memory (14) for storing the schedule data entered by the

input means (12), said apparatus characterized by:

first retrieve means, responsive to a user inputting a data search
command, for retrieving the pictorial symbols associated with the

schedule data entries stored in said data memory (14) and displaying the
retrieved pictorial symbols on the display means (15): and
second retrieve means, responsive to the user selecting one of the
displayed pictorial symbols, for retrieving the schedule data entries which

are associated with the selected pictorial symbol data from said
data memory (14) and displaying the retrieved schedule data entries on

the display means (15).
The data storage apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that said data memory (14) has a schedule data storage area

(14c), and said input means (12) has means (12g) for inputting, as
data items of a schedule data entry, date data, schedule contents data

and pictorial symbol data.
The data storage apparatus according to claim 2, characterized in
that said first retrieve means includes a temporary storage 

memory (14a), means for reading out the pictorial symbol data
from said data memory (14) and performing a write operation for

writing the read-out pictorial symbol data into said temporary
storage memory (14a), and control means for disabling the write

operation when the read-out pictorial symbol data is the same as
has already been written in the temporary data memory (14a).
A data storage apparatus according to claim 1, characterized in
that said memory (14) includes a schedule data memory (14c) for

storing schedule data entries including date data, schedule contents data
and a pictorial symbol data representing the schedule contents;

and further comprising:

a mode selector (12a, 12b, 12c) for setting one of operation
modes including a schedule mode and a calendar mode, said first

retrieve means and said second retrieve means operating in the
schedule mode, for searching all pictorial symbol data from said

schedule data memory (14c) when a data search is executed and
displaying the pictorial symbol data included in the schedule data

and
calendar display control means operated in the calendar mode, for
reading out pictorial symbol data from the schedule data entries

associated with a specified date and displaying the read-out
pictorial symbol data with a calendar in which the specified date is

indicated.
