<ABSTRACT>
Plant for the purification of aqueous residues by aerobic digestion of activated sludge, consisting of a group of modular containers (1-4), each provided with means (5) for aerating the effluents and connecting means (8, 10, 11) for ensuring the transfer of the effluents in series from one of the said containers to the next one. This plant is particularly suited for the treatment of effluents characterised by a COD or BOD content the proportion of which fluctuates widely with time.

<CLAIMS>
An installation for the purification of residuary 
waters by aerobic digestion of activated muds, comprising 

a series of vertically disposed modular receptacles (1-4), 
each of the modular receptacles (1-4) being provided 

with devices (5) for aerating effluents and linking means 
(8, 10, 11) for transferring the effluents in series from 

one of the said receptacles to the subsequent receptacle, 
characterised in that the said series of modular 

receptacles (1-4) comprises : 

a first homogenisation receptacle (1) provided with 
aeration means disposed in the vicinity of the base (5), 
a series of digestion receptacles (2 - 4) each fitted 
with independent aerating means and having discharge 

means (11) allowing each of the receptacles in question 
to be kept at a constant fluid level,
 
the said installation having level indicators linked to 

the homogenisation receptacle and a monitoring and 
control device which uses the values supplied by these 

indicators to regulate the flow supply to the digestion 
receptacles and the aeration rate in the said digestion 

receptacles depending on the level of effluents in the 
homogenisation receptacle,
 
pumping means (9) being provided in order to transfer the 

liquid from the said first homogenisation receptacle (1) 
to the digestion receptacles (2-4). 
An installation as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that each of the receptacles is made from fibre-reinforced 

polyester. 
An installation as claimed in one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that each receptacle of modular design 

is fitted with conditioning means consisting of a coil  
 

integrated in the wall of the receptacle and surrounding 
the lateral surface thereof, into which a conditioning 

fluid can be fed. 
An installation as claimed in any one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that it incorporates 

an end-of-line decantation receptacle (12) for decanting 
the muds, provided with recycling devices (16, 17) so 

that at least some of the decanted muds can be recycled 
to one of the digestion receptacles in question. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1, characterised 
in that the means for conveying the effluents from the 

homogenisation receptacle into the next digestion 
receptacle is a pump submersed within the liquid fraction 

in the homogenisation receptacle. 
An installation as claimed in one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that at least one of the 

digestion receptacles (2-4) in question is designed as a 
double-bodied receptacle consisting of an inner tubular 

casing and a coaxial, external tubular casing. 
A method for purifying effluents from wine-making by aerobic digestion, 
characterised in that it is performed in a certain number 

of stages in vertically disposed receptacles as claimed 
in claims 1 to 6, whereby gas containing oxygen molecules 

is blasted in the effluents from the lower part of the receptacle, and 
comprising at least a first stage of homogenisation in 

which the level of effluents in the corresponding 
receptacle varies with the delivery rate of the 

effluents, and one or several digestion stages, in 
which the level of effluents in the relevant receptacle 

is kept substantially constant in spite of variations in 
the delivery rate of the effluents, whereby the delivery  

 
rate to the digester receptacles and the rate of air 

blast into the said digestion receptacle or receptacles 
are regulated in proportion to the level of effluents in 

the homogenisation stage so as to maintain a dissolved 
oxygen content in excess of 3 ppm in at least one of the 

digestion stages. 
A method as claimed in claim 7, incorporating a stage 
in which the effluents are decanted in order to separate 

digestion muds and at least a proportion of the decanted 
muds is recycled to one of the said digestion stages. 
A method as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that 
the blast of air or 
gas flow containing oxygen in one or 
more of the digestion stages is used to maintain a 

dissolved oxygen content of between 5 and 10 ppm in at 
least one of the digestion stages in question. 
A method as claimed in claim 9, characterised in 
that all the muds separated during decantation are 

recycled to one of the digestion stages and the rate of 
air blast at the stage to which recycling is 

effected or at a stage located downstream thereof allows the 
dissolved oxygen content to be maintained at a level in 

excess of 5 ppm.
