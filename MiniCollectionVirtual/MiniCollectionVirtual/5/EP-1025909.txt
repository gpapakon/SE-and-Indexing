<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a pressurising device, suitably
for use in pressurising of containers of medicant for

animals. According to the invention there is provided a
pressurising device (10) for a fluid container (46), the

pressurising device comprising a compressible air vessel
(14) and connecting means (12) to connect the vessel to the

container, characterised in that the connecting means is
substantially rigid, and in that the air vessel is mounted

directly upon the connecting means. There is also provided
a method of using the pressurising device comprising the

steps of {i} securing the pressurising device to a
container, {ii} holding the pressurising device and

container by one hand, and {iii} repeatedly compressing the
air vessel to introduce and maintain an excess pressure

within the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressurising device and method
of use.The invention is expected to find its greatest utility for
the pressurising of containers of medicant for animals, and
the following description will therefore relate
predominantly to such use. However, the use in other
applications is not thereby excluded.Certain types of livestock have been bred to produce meat
and/or milk for human consumption. Because of the selective
breeding involved in obtaining maximum human benefit from
the livestock, the livestock itself can sometimes suffer.Dairy cows in particular are nowadays able to produce a vast
quantity of milk, considerably in excess of what would
naturally be required for its calf or calves to drink. The
production of milk by the cow is brought upon by calving,
and the sudden increase in milk production at this time is
often in excess of what the cow's body can cope with by way
of natural hormonal changes. Thus, it is known that cows
often succumb to hypocalcemia or "milk fever", which is
caused by the rapid depletion of the cow's calcium stores as
the calcium is transferred to the milk.Hypocalcemia is known often to be a more significant problem
with cows on their second and third pregnancies, and is a
fatal condition. It is, however, treatable by the rapid
introduction of calcium to the cow; the calcium usually
being administered in the form of the liquid medicant
calcium borogluconate. To be effective quickly enough, the calcium borogluconate
must be administered subcutaneously or intravenously, and
this requires the insertion of a needle into the cow. A
container of the medicant may be connected by a flexible
conduit to the needle, for the medicant to flow therealong
and into the animal.It is possible to hold the container above the level of the
needle and to permit the medicant to flow into the animal by
gravity alone. Even if the container is held considerably
higher than the level of the needle a 400ml container may
take up to 15 minutes to administer in this way, and in some
cases up to 800ml of medicant may be required. It is
difficult for a person to hold the container up high for
such a long time. Also, it is possible that the needle may
be indavertently removed from the animal if the animal moves
unexpectedly during this time. In addition, such
administration may be too slow to save the animal.A device for pressurising the medicant container is known,
so that the medicant flows under pressure into the animal.
With such a device, a 400ml container of medicant can be
administer
