<ABSTRACT>
The data input device (11) comprises, above a resistive layer arrangement (2), an arrangement (4) of deformable layers consisting at least partially of dielectric material. This material is elastically deformable so that, when pressure is applied onto the input surface, the distance between the input surface and the resistive layer arrangement (2) is reduced at the pressure point. On the side of the deformable layer arrangement (4) facing away from the resistive layer arrangement (2), there is arranged an electrode which preferably is formed as a conductive layer (1). Thus results in a change of the capacitive properties of the deformable layer arrangement (4) at the pressure point since the thickness of the deformable layer arrangement (4) is reduced on this site. This capacitive measurement is used for detection of the pressing force, while the position of the pressing point within the input surface is detected in two mutually orthogonal directions on the basis of the voltage divider forming in the resistive layer arrangement (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a data input 
device with a pressure-sensitive input surface. By use of such data input devices, it is possible to 
convert handwritten notes, for example signatures, into 
computer readable data. Subsequently, these data can be 
processed by the computer such that the signature trace 
resulting from the position signals is reconstructable 
and smoothable to a degree that allows the exact comparison 
with a signature already stored in the computer. Devices for data input via pressure-sensitive input 
surfaces are known from EP-0 032 013 and from U.S. 
Patent 4,636,582. These devices utilize the so-called 
"pressure sensitive method", wherein, for evaluation of 
the signature, the registration thereof is performed 
solely by the influence of the pressure of a writing 
instrument on an input surface provided as a sensor. 
The pen that is to be used therein is supposed to apply  
 
a pressure on the input surface of the sensor in such a 
way that handwritten notes or the signature, respectively, 
can be recognized as pressure signals by the 
sensor and passed on to an evaluation circuit. The 
internal structure of the data input device featuring 
this sensor is arranged such that it can convert the 
position of the writing instrument whose tip is pressed 
on the surface of the input surface or the sensor surface 
into measurable electric magnitudes, which give a 
measure for the x- and y-position of the individual 
pressure- and contact-points of the pen while the signature 
is produced. According to EP-0 032 013 and U.S. Patent 4,636,582, 
the formation of the electric magnitudes is achieved by 
utilizing a data input device in which a flexible electrically 
conductive layer is located in a certain distance 
above a resistive layer. If no pressure is applied, 
these two layers are separated from each other 
by an electrically insulating layer. The insulating 
layer is flexible and is configured such that the insulating 
layer made by screen printing will be deformed 
in the pressure point of the writing instrument so that 
through the grating- or point-like mesh openings a 
galvanic contact between the upper conductive layer and 
the lower resistive layer is made. This leads to the 
formation of a voltage division across the resistive 
layer, where the partial resistances are given as a 
function of the position of the pen pressure. According to EP-0 032 013, it is known that, at the 
four outer corners of a rectangular resistive layer, 
voltages are applied
