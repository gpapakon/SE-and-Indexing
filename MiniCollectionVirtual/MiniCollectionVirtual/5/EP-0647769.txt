<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the exchange and assembly of large turbine casing components (1, 2), guide keys (3) divided into two along the longitudinal side and respective fitted bolts (4) are used, the two parts of the guide key (3) first of all being installed with a snug fit in the key seats of the casing components (1, 2) to be connected, a pilot hole then being produced in the parting plane of the key pair and the two halves of the guide key (3) removed and fitted together by means of the pilot hole, whereupon the final hole for the fitting bolt (4) is drilled. Finally, the guide key (3) is installed and the fitting bolts (4) inserted.
