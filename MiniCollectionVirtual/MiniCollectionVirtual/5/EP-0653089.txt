<DESCRIPTION>
 __,_Marking deviceDESCRIPTIONThe present invention relates to a marking device intended for marking elongated objects such as electric wires, cables, tubes or the like, in accordance with the preamble of the main claim.Such a marking device is used for e.g. marking electric wires in coupling boxes, whereas a combination of symbols, usually numerals and characters, are assembled to enable the identification of each specific wire.A device of the above mentioned art is known from SE-A-458001, in which a marking device is disclosed said marking device including a supporting part which, by means of a cable tie, can be fixed onto a wire or the like, a holder in the form of an elongated part and marking elements, which elements support a symbol marking on one side and which elements are intended to be threaded onto the holder and fixed into position.Another known device is shown and described in CH-A-364539. This known marking device comprises a fastening component in the form of a clamp which is brought over the wire, or the like, which is to be marked, after which a bracket holder for the marking element is locked onto the fastening component by means of a spring locking function, whereby the fastening component is fixed into position on the wire.Yet another known marking device is shown and described in EP-B-0035460. This device comprises a fastening component made in one piece with a bracket holder for the marking element, whereby the distal end of the holder averted from the fastening component, is provided with a spring hook to keep the marking elements on said holder.These known devices for marking of elongated objects, such as electric wires or the like, have the disadvantage of requiring one marking element for each symbol marking. This leads to high production and handling costs and also causes the inconvenÂ¬ ience that the user must be provided with a large supply of marking elements covering all the symbols needed in order to supply the combinations required.The purpose with the present invention is to achieve a marking device of the type mentioned above, which leads to a considerable reduction of production and handling costs. 

 A further aim of the invention is to achieve a marking device which is of a simple construction and has a simple function and which moreover is very simple to fit on an object such as wires, tubes, couplings or any other objects to be marked.The purposes of the invention are achieved by a marking device having the characteristics of the patent claim 1.Preferred

CLAIMS
1. A marking device intended for the marking of an object (102, 202, 403), comprising at least one marking element (104, 204, 408), provided with a through hole (105) and at least one surface (106, 209, 413) provided with symbol markings (107, 208, 412), a supporting part (108, 203, 402) intended to be fixed onto said object, holding means (111, 407) for supporting said marking element and means (105) to maintain predetermined marking elements in a predetermined position, characterized in that each marking element (104, 208, 412) along its periphery has four side surfaces (106, 209, 413) provided with symbol markings (107, 208, 412) and that said means is constituted by said holder (111) and said hole (105) in the cross section being so formed, that when the holder (111) is brought into said opening, said marking element (104) is fixed in an intended position such that the intended symbol marking lies in a plane intended for registering.
2. The marking device according to Claim 1, characterized in that said marking element (104, 204, 408) has the shape of a right-angled parallelepiped, the through hole of which has a cross-shaped cross section.
3. The marking device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the holder (205) has, in its longitudinal direction, plane covering parts (206, 207) in the shape of protruding, parallel flanges, which in assembled state cover the symbol markings on two of the surfaces of the marking elements, so that only the symbol markings (208) on the marking elements (204) are visible.
4. The marking device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that an arrow (113, 411) or similar marks are printed on the supporting part (108, 203, 402) and/or on one stopping part (112, 210) to indicate which symbol marking or markings (107, 208, 412) that are intended.
5. The marking device according to any of the Claims 1 - 4, characterized in that the holder (111) is formed in one piece with the supporting part (103) and is formed as a tie with transverse cable tie flutes for the direct fixing of said marking element, or by means of a stopping part (210). 


6. The marking device according to any of the Claims 1 - 5, characterized in that the holder consists of a tie (111, 211) with transverse cable tie flutes and a, at one end arranged, stopping part (112, 212), whereby said tie, after the intended number of marking elements (204) have been assembled, is arranged to be received and locked in a hole in the stopping part arranged for locking of the cable tie.
7. The marking device according to any of Claims 1 - 6, characterized in that the supporting part (103) is provided with fastening means (115, 117) for attaching the same on said object (102).
8. The marking device according to Claim 7, characterized in that said fastening means comprises an attachment tie (405) provided with cable tie flutes and formed in one piece with said supporting part (402) and that a hole (404) for cable tie locking is arranged in the supporting part for receiving said attachment tie to attach the maridng device on said object.
9. The marking device according to any of Claims 1 - 8, characterized in that said object is an electric wire, a cable or a tube.
