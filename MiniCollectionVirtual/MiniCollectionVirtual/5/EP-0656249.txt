<ABSTRACT>
Modular base (1) for tile cutters including an 
extruded hollow profiled element (2) which is 

longitudinally provided with a median rib (8) on one of its 
faces and has, along its lateral edges, interlocking joints 

(9) for the coupling of optional lateral extensions (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modular base for
tile cutters.Bases for tile cutters are constituted by an elongated
platform to which an upper median rib is longitudinally
rigidly coupled: two posts are fixed to the ends of said rib
and support a rail along which a slider is movably mounted;
a wheel for cutting into the surface of the tile and a shoe
for breaking the tile by pressing it (simultaneously on the
two sides of the cutting line cut previously with the wheel)
against the rib of the base are installed on said slider.Known bases, which must be rather strong and relatively
non-deformable, are usually manufactured by casting or by
pressing metallic material: this entails the execution of a
relatively large number of molds (practically one for each
base size to be produced) and a considerable use of material
which entails hardly negligible costs and weights.EP-A-0 428 070 discloses a modular base as defined in
the preamble of independent claim 1.The principal aim of the present invention is to
obviate the above drawbacks of known devices; in other
words, to provide a modular base for tile cutters which is
extremely light and strong and does not entail the
manufacture of a mold for each size.Within the scope of this aim, an object of the present
invention is to achieve the above aim with a structure that
is simple, relatively easy to execute in practice, safe in
use, effective in operation and relatively cheap.The present invention provides a modular base for tile
cutters, which is characterized in that it comprises an 
extruded hollow profiled element which is longitudinally
provided with a median rib on one of its faces and has,
along its lateral edges, interlocking joints for the
coupling of optional lateral extensions.The characteristics and advantages of the invention
will become apparent and evident from the following
detailed description of a preferred but not exclusive
embodiment thereof, illustrated only by way of non-limitative
example in the accompanying drawings, wherein:
figure 1 is a partially sectional front view of a
modular base for tile cutters according to the invention;figure 2 is a plan view of an end of the base of
figure 1;figure 3 shows two views, in orthogonal projection, of
a front closing element of the base.With particular reference to the above figures, the
reference numeral 1 generally designates a modular base for
tile cutters according to the invention.The base 1 is constituted by an extruded hollow
profiled element 2 made of a material such as aluminum
alloys, in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A modular base (1) for tile cutters, comprising an
extruded hollow profiled element (2) which is longitudinally

provided with a median rib (8) on one of its faces and has,
along its lateral edges, connection means for the coupling

of lateral extensions (10), characterized in that said
connection means comprise interlocking joints (9) for the

coupling of optional lateral extensions (10), said interlocking joints (9) extending

along the full length of said lateral edges of the modular
base.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that
said interlocking joints (9) are of the dovetail type.
The base according to claim 2, characterized in that
said interlocking joints (9) are of the mortise kind.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that
said profiled element (2) has, in a downward region,

longitudinal resting ridges (11) at its center and sides.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that
the ends of said profiled elements are closed by respective

snap-on closure elements (17) which can be rigidly coupled
to the profiled elements by means of screws which couple in

respective seats (23) formed by extrusion.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that
at least two lateral oscillating secondary surfaces (31) are

mounted in an upward region on said base, said secondary
surfaces being provided with modular feet (35) for

connection to said base, helical compression springs being
centered on said feet.
The base according to claim 1, characterized in that
said median rib (8) is removable and has, in a downward 

region, an interlocking coupling for a corresponding
longitudinal slot of said profiled element (2).
The base according to claim 7, characterized in that
the interlocking coupling of said median rib is of the

dovetail type.
