constitution as to allow the user to use with a writing 

tool-like feeling, whether in vertical puling or in lateral 
pulling, depending on the own manner of holding a writing 

tool. A coating film transfer head (H) is adjustable in 
angle about its axial line, and by adjusting the head (H) 

angle according to the application of the user or depending 
on the user's manner of holding a writing tool, the user 

can grip the case (2) like holding a writing tool, and 
press a coating film transfer tape (Y) tightly onto the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coating film
transfer tool for transferring a coating film such as a
corrective paint layer and an adhesive layer on a coating
film transfer tape onto a paper surface or the like, and
more particularly to a coating film transfer tool allowing
the individual users to take a position of use freely
depending on the own manner of holding the pencil or other
writing implement in the transfer operation of the coating
film.As examples of this kind of coating film transfer
tool, we proposed coating film transfer tools disclosed in
Japanese Laid-open Patent No. 5-58097
& EP-A-556406 (showing the preamble of claim 1)
and Japanese Laid-open
Utility Model No. 5-13800.These coating film transfer tools are mainly used as
erasing tools for correcting errors or the like, and
comprise, as shown respectively in FIG. 23 and FIG. 24, a
pay-out reel (c) with a coating film transfer tape (b)
wound thereabout, and a winding reel (d) for collecting the
coating film transfer tape (b) after use, rotatably 
provided in a case (a) that is held and manipulated by
hand. The case (a) has a coating film transfer head (f)
for pressing the coating film transfer tape (b) against a
transfer area (correction area on paper) (e), projecting
from a front end thereof. The coating film transfer tape
(b) paid out of the pay-out reel (c) is wound on the
winding reel (d) through a pressing part (g) in the front
end of the head (f).Herein, the case (a) is formed in a flat box-like
shape, having contour shape and size and width size
sufficient for containing the pay-out reel (c) and winding
reel (d) therein, and the flat front and back surfaces of
the case (a), that is, the front and back surfaces relative
to the sheet surface of FIG. 23 and FIG. 24 are gripping
surfaces to be held by hand when manipulating.In the former example, as shown in FIG. 23, it is
constituted so that the pressing part (g) of the head (f)
may guide the coating film transfer tape (b) in a same
attitude as it is wound about the pay-out reel (c) and
winding reel (d), and it is a so-called vertical pulling
applicable structure suited to correction of part of
vertically written sentence such as a Japanese text. That
is, when using, the user grips the gripping surfaces (front
and back surfaces) of the case (a) by fingers, and presses
the coating film transfer tape (b) tightly to the 
correction area (e) by the pressing part (g) of the head
(f) as shown in the drawing, and moves the case (a) in the
vertical direction, that is, in the downward
