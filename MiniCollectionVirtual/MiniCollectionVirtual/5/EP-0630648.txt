<ABSTRACT>
The use of acyl L-carnitine esters with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid is 
described in which the acyl is preferably acetyl, propionyl, n-butyryl, 

isobutyryl, valeryl or isovaleryl to produce a drug to suppress withdrawal 
symptoms and the craving for self-administration of narcotic substances 

in drug addicts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to in a new therapeutic use of acyl
L-carnitine esters with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid of formula (I)

which represents them in the form of inner salts, in which R is linear or
branched acyl with from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably acetyl,
propionyl, n-butyryl, isobutyryl, valeryl or isovaleryl,
or formula (I')

which represents them in the form of salts with pharmacologically
acceptable acids, where R has the meaning indicated above and X- is the
anion of such an acid.X- is, for example: chloride; bromide; iodide; aspartate, particularly
acid aspartate; citrate, particularly acid citrate; tartrate; phosphate,
particularly acid phosphate; fumarate, particularly acid fumarate; 
glycerophosphate; glucose phosphate; lactate; maleate; particularly acid
maleate; orotate; oxalate, particularly acid oxalate; sulphate, particularly
acid sulphate; trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate and methanesulphonate.The formula (I) or formula (I') esters are used for the preparation
of a medicament for the treatment of addiction to psychotropic and
narcotic substances such as opiods, amphetamines, cocaine, heroine and
morphine. This medicament suppresses withdrawal symptoms in drug
addicts (such as tremors, perspiration, hyperreflexia, nausea, anxiety and
convulsions), drug addiction and the craving for self-administration of
narcotic substances.The formula (I) and (I') esters are known compounds. In European
patent application No. 0 442 850 A1 (published on 21.08.91) their
synthesis, physico-chemical characteristics and pharmacological activity
in inhibiting neuronal degeneration (as occurring typically in Alzheimer's
dementia and in Parkinson's disease) and in the treatment of coma are
described.In European patent application No. 0 514 357 A1 (published on
19.11.92) a further therapeutic use of these formula (I) and (I') esters to
produce a drug for the treatment of liver diseases is described.
Br. J. Exp. Pathol.; 58(6), 1977, p. 606-615 describes that D,L-Carnitine reduced ethanol
withdrawal symptoms. EP-A-344 704 describes that gamma-butyric acid salts are effective
in treating alcohol-dependence. There is no relationship between these known uses and the use
envisaged in this invention.The mechanisms underlying addiction to the various psychotropic
and narcotic substances, such as opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, etc.,
are complex and probably specific to each substance category. Activation
of dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic system, however, appears to
be a process common to the

Use of an ester as per formula (I)


in which R is linear or branched acyl with from 2 to 5 carbon
atoms, or as per formula (I')
