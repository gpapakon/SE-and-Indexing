<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS AND INTERMEDIATES FOR THE PREPARATION OF SUBSTITUTED D,L-2-(7-FLUORO-3, -DIHYDRO-3-OXO-2H-1,^-BENZOXAZIN-6-YL)- PERHYDROIMIDAZO l,5-A/PYRIDINE-l, 3-DIONESThis invention relates to a process and intermediates for the preparation of substituted D,L-2-(7-fluoro- 3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-2H-l,4-benzoxazin-6-yl)perhydro- imidazo[l,5-a]pyridine-l,3-diones of general formula I
 in which R1 is C^Cg-al yl, C2-C6-alkenyl or C3-C6-alkynyl.The compounds of formula I have herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds in agricultural crops. Their preparation and use are described in EP 311 135.The known syntheses starting from 2-nitro-5-fluorophenol give, over 6 stages, a total yield of 26% of I. These go via the highly insoluble 7-fluoro-2H-benzoxazin-3 (4H)-one derivatives. For example the intermediate 7-fluoro-6-amino-2H-l,4-benzoxazin-3 (4H)-one is not very soluble in a number of solvents, so that the compound, which is obtained by an environmentally damaging catalytic hydrogenation, can be separated from the catalyst only under great difficulty. This process has the further disadvantage that the synthesis goes via an isocyanate intermediate, whose preparation on the one hand involves phosgene or triphosgene and on the other hand the presence of further reactive groups in the molecule is only very limited. This has the consequence that the introduction of 

 the sometimes very expensive group R1 must be introduced before the isocyanate step which make the preparation of the end product considerably more expensive. From the industrial viewpoint this process is therefore not particularly suitable for a large scale production.The known process is as followsphosgene/toluene
The object of the present invention is to provide a new process which allows preparation of compounds of general formula I without any problems on an industrial scale, and under mild reaction conditions, whilst avoiding the stated disadvantages.This object is solved by a process in which a) 2-amino-5-fluorophenol of formula IIis reacted with acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride, in the presence of an acid binding agent, optionally in a suitable solvent.b) the acetanilide, so formed, of formula III
 His reacted with a compound of general formula IV0R4^0 ^Y IVin which R4 is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl and Y is halogen, methanesulfonyloxy or p-toluenesulfonyloxy,c) the phenoxyacetic acid, so formed, of general formula V 

 is nitrated with nitric acid, or an organic or inorganic derivative thereof, optionally
