<ABSTRACT>
In an indexing insert (1), the symbol (11) which is borne by the tab (9) is not printed directly onto the tab (9) but has been appended to the reinforcement (12) of the tab (9). As a result, in the device for fabricating the indexing inserts, additional positioning means are not required in order to hold the blank for the indexing insert correspondingly to the position of the tab (9) in a printing station.
