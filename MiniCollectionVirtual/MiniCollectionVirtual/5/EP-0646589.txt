<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel anti-tumor platinum (IV) complex 
which may be liposoluble. A certain kind of a platinum complex has been known to have an 
anti-tumor function, and such platinum complexes have been reported and 
been practically used. While, especially, a cis-dichlorodiammine platinum 
(II) complex (general name: cisplatine) and carboplatine are employed 
mainly for a spermary cancer, an ovarium cancer, a vesica cancer, a lung 
cancer and a cervix cancer, a platinum complex effective for the other 
organ tumors (for example, a brain tumor) other than the above cancers has 
seldom been reported. A platinum complex having a high specificity to a 
certain organ is desired. Among the platinum complexes, a platinum (IV) complex of an isomer 
having a formula of PtCl₄-dach ("dach" designates cyclohexanediamine) has 
been expected to have new possibilities and reported (USP No. 4, 599, 352, 
European Patent Publications Nos. 43490/77, 156659/78 and 13888/78,  
 
British Patent Publication Nos. 8328218 and 8028484). However, all of these complexes are chlorinated ones, and they are 
not necessarily satisfactory in connection with the anti-tumor function in 
internal organs. No complexes other than chlorinated ones have been 
reported and their anti-tumor functions are unknown. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
anti-tumor platinum complex which possesses more excellent anti-tumor 
characteristics than a conventional one, especially effective for internal 
organ tumors. Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
anti-tumor platinum complex which may perorally administrated. The liposoluble platinum (IV) complex of the present invention is, as 
mentioned later, excellent in anti-tumor characteristics, and because the 
complex is liposoluble, it is remarkably useful for recovering internal 
organ cancers in addition to the spermary cancer and the like. Some of the complexes of the present invention have one or more 
liposoluble groups, for example, a carboxylic group having a long carbon 
chain, on its Z-axis to be more active against tumors. It is pointed out that an anti-tumor complex which is effective for 
the internal organ cancers, especially for the brain tumor is required to 
have a high liposolubility. Because of the above liposoluble group, the 
complex of the present invention is considerably effective for various 
tumors or cancers. The present invention is an anti-tumor liposoluble halogenated 
platinum (IV) complex having a
