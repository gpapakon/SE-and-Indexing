<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an epoxy resin composition
which is suited for use in the electric and electronic
industry, especially for use as an IC encapsulating
material, more specifically, to an epoxy resin composition
comprising an epoxy resin of a derivative containing
specific structures in 2- and 5-positions of hydroquinone,
an epoxy hardener, and an inorganic filler, and molding of
the composition can be endowed with low stress and water
absorption and high heat resistance.Epoxy resin is used in a substrate for constructing
electronic devices and parts such as LSIs and laminate
boards and, recently, is drawing attention as an IC sealing
material in the field of electronics which is under a rapid
technical innovation.In general, an epoxy resin composition used in these
epoxy resin molding compounds produced from an epoxy resin,
a hardener, an accelerator, a filler, a fire retardant 
agent, a coupling agent, a release agent, and a coloring
agent, which are mixed and kneaded to form a composition and
used as a molding compound.Heretofore, as an epoxy resin for these molding
compounds, an o-cresol novolac type epoxy resin is widely
used for its heat resistance, moldability, and electrical
characteristics. However, recently, with the tendency of
semiconductor devices to higher integration, compact and
thin-walled packages, and improved packaging efficiency, the
epoxy resin composition for use in these applications is
required to have even higher heat resistance and even lower
water absorption and stress.To improve the stress characteristics of the epoxy
resin composition, it is effective to increase the content
of inorganic fillers such as a filler mainly comprising
fused silica to reduce the thermal expansion coefficient of
the composition and, since such inorganic fillers are
superior in heat resistance arid low water absorption, they
are effective to meet requirements for heat resistance and
low water absorption and stress.However, there has been a problem in that the use of
o-cresol novolac type epoxy resin, which has been widely
used in the past, and increased amounts of inorganic fillers
tend to result in an increase in melt viscosity and a
considerable decrease in fluidity during molding, damaging 
fine-structured electronic devices to be sealed. Therefore,
it is preferable to use an epoxy resin which has a low
viscosity in the vicinity of the molding temperature.Low-viscosity epoxy olefins include bisphenol A type
epoxy resin, which is liquid at room temperature, and
bisphenol F type epoxy
