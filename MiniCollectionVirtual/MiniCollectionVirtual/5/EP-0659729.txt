<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for the preparation of polyfluorochloro- and perfluorocarboxylic acid chlorides, for example the preparation of perfluoropropionyl chloride, chlorodifluoroacetyl chloride and trifluoroacetyl chloride. In these reactions, starting materials are employed which have a CHCl2 group which is converted into the C(O)Cl group by means of photochemical oxidation with oxygen with an addition of chlorine and activating irradiation. The reaction is carried out in such a way that the light used for irradiation has a wavelength  lambda  
>
/= 290 nm. The process is preferably carried out under atmospheric pressure. Excellent conversion rates combined with high selectivity are achieved when doped Hg radiators are used.
