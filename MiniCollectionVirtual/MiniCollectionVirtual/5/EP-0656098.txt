<ABSTRACT>
A gerotor pump is made of extremely compact axial dimensions by using a shaft (30), which is neither fast with the pump body (10) nor journalled in the pump body (10). This is achieved by making the shaft fast with either or both of the rotor (26) or the hub (22) of the drive gear (20) and journalling the drive gear on the body by a bush (18). The bearing length which carries the cantilever load is thus co-extant or substantially so with the gerotor set.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a gerotor pump which, as 
well known, comprise a male lobed rotor with n lobes, 
located in and meshed with a female lobed annulus having 
n+1 lobes. This rotor and annulus, called the gerotor 
set, rotate relative to one another about parallel axes 
so that a series of chambers each defined between a pair 
of parallel lines of contact between the two parts rotate 
about said axes, increase in size as they pass over an 
inlet port in a first half revolution, and decrease in 
size as they pass over an outlet port in the following 
half revolution. The ports are formed in a body having a 
cylindrical cavity for the gerotor set. Many different designs of gerotor pump as known; in 
EP 0,361,716A the construction shown in Figure 6 for 
example includes a drive gear which is journalled on a 
cylindrical part of the pump body and is angularly fast 
at its inner portion or hub with an axial extension from 
the rotor. The rotor is journalled on a shaft fast with 
the body. The objects of the present invention are to simplify 
manufacture and particularly to provide for axial 
compactness, without sacrificing efficiency or 
durability. The invention is defined in the appended Claims. The pump of the invention is distinguished from the 
prior art in that the shaft is neither fast with the body 
(as has previously been suggested in certain prior art 
patents e.g. the mentioned EP 0361716A) nor is it 
journalled in the body, which has been the norm in pumps 
of this kind. When the shaft is fast with the body, it 
is necessary to provide a certain body length which can 
support the shaft in cantilever fashion, and when the 
shaft is journalled in the body an even greater axial 
length has to be provided to support the shaft. By  
 
supporting the shaft from the drive gear, with which it 
is fast and journalling the gear, reduced axial 
dimensions are possible without any sacrifice of pump 
performance. The axial length of the shaft is equal to the sum of 
the axial length of the rotor, the axial thickness of the 
drive gear and its hub, i.e. in the region of the shaft, 
and the dimension between the two parts, if any. The pump body may be cup-shaped with the base of the 
cup apertured for the shaft to extend through, and the 
rim of the cup may sit on an associated part such as the 
face of an engine block or sump. Or the rim of the cup 
may be associated with a closure plate. The shaft may 
extend up to that block, sump or plate with a slight end 
clearance for the shaft. The shaft may be
