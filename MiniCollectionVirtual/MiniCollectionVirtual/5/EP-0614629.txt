<ABSTRACT>
A cover (18) is pivotably attached to a case body (1). Male 
thread portions (7) of a multiple thread and unthreaded 

portions are alternately formed on a peripheral wall (6) of a 
cosmetic container section of the case body. A ring (41) is 

rotatably attached to the cover (18) and externally fitted to 
the peripheral wall (6). The ring (41) has female thread portions (51) 

of a multiple thread intermittently formed. The female 
and male thread portions (51,7) are engageable and 

disengageable. An inner cover (61) made of an elastic material 
is attached to the lower portion of the cover (18) so that the 

inner cover (61) is brought into press contact with an open 
edge of the peripheral wall. A space (60) is formed between 

the cover (18) and the inner cover (61) so that the inner cover (61) is 
elastically deformed and expanded. When the female and 

the male thread portions (51,7) are engaged with each other and 
the ring (41) is rotated to a closed position, the cover (18) 

approaches the case body (1) so that the inner cover (61) is 
brought into press contact with the open edge of the 

peripheral wall. When the temperature within the cosmetic 
container section (14) is increased, the inner cover (61) is 

elastically expanded upwards to increase the volume 
within the cosmetic container section (14). Thus, an increase 

in pressure within the cosmetic container section (14) is 

suppressed. Accordingly, even if this airtight compact 
case is used in an environment subjected to wide 

temperature variation, it is possible to reliably 
maintain the sealing condition of the cosmetic container 

section (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cosmetic compact case
capable of airtightly sealing a cosmetic container
section.Conventional compact cases of the type described
are disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Nos.
171617/1983 and 181305/1983. Each of these compact cases
comprises a case body, a cover having one end pivotably
attached to one end of the case body, and engaging members
attached to the other ends of the case body and the cover.
A cosmetic container section defined by an inner tray can
be kept airtight by sealing an open edge of the inner tray
with a packing material. The above-mentioned compact
cases of an airtight sealing type can prevent a cosmetic
product in the inner tray from evaporating and leaking out
to be reduced in amount when the cosmetic product contains
an evaporable substance.The above-mentioned conventional compact cases have
no serious problem inasmuch as they are used in an
environment without any substantial temperature
variation. If they are placed in an environment subjected
to a wide temperature variation, however, sealing becomes
insufficient due to a pressure variation within the
cosmetic container section following the temperature
variation. This may result in generation of an air flow 
into and out of the inner tray.Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 119315/1991
discloses another compact case of an airtight sealing type
having a different structure. Such document teaches the features of the
preamble of claim 1. The compact case thereof comprises
a case body, a cover pivotably attached to the case body,
and a ring rotatably attached to the cover. When the ring
is rotated, a multiple thread mechanism formed between the
ring and an inner tray brings the cover into press contact
with the case body. A cylindrical packing member made of
an elastic material such as rubber is attached to the
cover with a tongue at its top end obliquely downwardly
directed. When the ring is tightened, the tongue of the
packing member is pressed against an upper surface of a
peripheral edge of the inner tray and is bent in press
contact therewith.In this compact case, the tongue is deeply bent in
press contact with the inner tray. Being bent so deeply,
it takes a long time to restore the tongue of the packing
member to its original shape before it is bent, when the
cover is opened after a long time closure. In the event
that the cover is closed immediately after it is opened in
such a manner, the tongue and the inner tray often fail to
be brought into tight contact with each other. As a
