<ABSTRACT>
A centrex with an attendant console sharing 
system wherein there is no restriction in an extension 

line numbering plan so that an attendant console can 
accept a call to any business group and will connect the 

call only to the extension line station of the business 
group for which the call is destined. Means for 

connecting 12 of the centrex links attendant console 2 to 
business group attendant console data corresponding to the 

business group for which an incoming call is destined in 
accordance with pilot number-to-attendant console 

conversion table 3 when the call arrives at attendant 
console 2 from a public network subscriber and in 

accordance with business group number-to-attendant console 
conversion table 4 when the call arrives from an extension 

line station of the business group.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an attendant console
sharing system in a centrex, and particularly to controlling
an attendant console sharing system in a centrex.More specifically, the present invention relates
to improvements in operability of an attendant console and
to flexibility of an extension line numbering plan for
business groups in a case wherein the attendant console is
shared by a plurality of business groups such as a
plurality of enterprises located in the same premises for
the object of economy.Fig. 1 is a view showing an example of a
conventional centrex system.Attendant console 21c is provided for a specific
business group such as business group C, and performs call
connection assistance to extension line stations 81c and
82c.However, in order to reduce the economic burden
of installing an attendant console, it is required to
share an attendant console among centrex customers. Based
on the centrex service, business groups D and E join in a
group forming a centrex complex 13 and share attendant 
console 22. In this instance, when a call to a pilot
number of one of business groups D or E arrives, the call
is connected to attendant console 22, and assistance to
call connection to one of extension line stations 81d to
83d in business group D or extension line stations 81e to
83e in business group E is performed by attendant console
22. In this instance, if some extension line numbers
overlap among the business groups which share the
attendant console, since an extension line station cannot
be designated from the attendant console, an extension
line number allocation condition (numbering plan) must be
decided among the business groups.In the example of Fig. 1, extension line numbers
of the one hundred level such as 111, 112 and 113 are
allocated to extension line stations 81d to 83d of
business group D, respectively, and extension line numbers
of the two hundred level such as 211, 212 and 213 are
allocated to extension line subscribers 81e to 83e of
business group E, respectively.Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic view showing an example
of an attendant console sharing system with a conventional
private branch exchange (for example, Japanese Patent
Laid-Open No. 239757/1987). In the second conventional
system shown in Fig. 7, business groups F and G share
private branch exchange 14, and business group numbers nf
and ng are allocated to extension line stations such as 
81f and 82f and extension line stations 81g and 82g
belonging to business groups F and G, respectively.

<CLAIMS>
An attendant console sharing system in a centrex
which comprises switching equipment (1) in which a

plurality of extension line stations which belong to a
plurality of business groups (A,B) are connectable to a

plurality of subscriber lines of a public telephone
network, and an attendant console (2) connected to said

switching equipment (1), said switching equipment
including main memory means (MM) for storing subscriber

data (61a, 61b, 63a, 63b)for said extension line
stations belonging to each business group (A,B) and

business group data (21a, 21b) holding connection
attributes and numbering plans of each business group,

and a central controller (CC) including controlling
means for sharing said attendant console among said

business groups (A,B) to perform a centrex service,
said attendant console sharing system being


characterised by
:

business group attendant console data (5a, 5b)
which is provided for each of the business groups (A,B)

and holds a connection attribute peculiar to each
attendant console (2) for the business group (A,B);
means for selecting, in response to an incoming
call through one of pilot numbers to said attendant

console, the business group (A,B) for which the call is
destined and linking the selected business group

attendant console data (5a, 5b) to said attendant
console (2); and, 
means for selecting, in response to an access call
to said attendant console (2) by dialling an access

code from an extension line, the business group (A,B)
in which the extension line station is accommodated and

linking the selected business group attendant console
data (5a, 5b) to said attendant console (2).
The attendant console sharing system as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the two selecting-and-linking means

include:

a pilot number-to-attendant console conversion
table (3) in which the business group pilot numbers

(X,Y) and address pointers to the business group
attendant console data (5a,5b) are stored in a

corresponding relationship; and,
a business group number-to-attendant console
conversion table (4) in which the group numbers applied

to the business groups and address pointers to the
business group attendant console data (5a,5b) are

stored in a corresponding relationship; and wherein
said controlling means (CC) includes means for

connecting for linking, when receiving an incoming call
to said attendant console (2), said attendant console

(2) to the attendant console data (5a,5b) for the
business group (A,B) which corresponds to the incoming

call.
The attendant console sharing system as claimed in
claim 2, wherein said means for connecting includes

means for linking, in response to an incoming call to
one of the pilot numbers (X,Y) of the business groups

(A,B) from a subscriber of said public telephone
network, said attendant console (2) to the attendant

console data (5a,5b) corresponding to the business

group for which the call is destined in accordance with
the content of said pilot number-to-attendant console

conversation table (3); and,

   means for linking, in response to an incoming call
to said attendant console (2) through a dialling

attendant console access code from an extension line
station in the business groups (A,B), said attendant

console (2) to the attendant console data (5a, 5b)
corresponding to the business group (A,B) for which the

call is destined in accordance with the content of said
business group number-to-attendant console conversion

table (4).
