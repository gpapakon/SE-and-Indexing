<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles having a topsheet, a backsheet, and an absorbent core between the topsheet and the backsheet. The backsheet comprises a moisture vapor permeable, substantially liquid impermeable composite sheet material includes a powder-bonded nonwoven web adhered to a moisture vapor permeable thermoplastic film. The nonwoven web includes a first layer comprised primarily of fibers that are compatible with an adhesive used to bond the web, and a second layer comprised of a blend of fibers, some of which are compatible with, and some of which are incompatible with the bonding adhesive and the thermoplastic film. A method for making the composite sheet material and an item of apparel made from the sheet material are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to absorbent articles such as diapers, adult
incontinence garments, and feminine hygiene products. The present invention further
relates to such absorbent articles having outer coverings having a thin moisture vapor
permeable film and a multiple layer fibrous substrate that combine to form a composite
sheet that is durable, strong, and flexible, that acts as a barrier to liquids, bacteria, viruses
and odors, yet is also highly permeable to moisture vapor.Various woven and nonwoven sheet materials used in making medical drapes,
medical gowns and absorbent articles, such as diapers and sanitary napkins, must be
comfortable, soft, pliable and substantially liquid impermeable. The sheet materials used
in medical apparel and absorbent articles function to contain the discharged materials
and/or to isolate these materials from the body of the wearer or from the wearer's
garments and bed clothing. As used herein, the term "absorbent article" refers to devices
which absorb and contain body exudates, and, more specifically, refers to devices which
are placed against or in proximity to the body of the wearer to absorb and contain the
various exudates discharged from the body. Absorbent articles include disposable
diapers, incontinence briefs, incontinence undergarments, incontinence pads, feminine
hygiene garments, training pants, pull-on garments, and the like.An ideal sheet material for use in medical apparel and absorbent articles will
exhibit a high moisture vapor transmission rate that will reduce the build up of heat and
humidity inside garments and articles made from the material. The ideal sheet material
will also exhibit excellent barrier properties so as to prevent the passage or seepage of
fluids, and will even prevent the passage of bacteria and viruses. The ideal material must
also be strong enough so that it does not rip or delaminate under normal usage conditions
regardless of whether the material is dry or wet. Where the sheet material is to be used in
apparel, it is also important that the material be flexible, soft and drapable. Finally, where
the sheet material is to be used in medical apparel, it is important that the sheet not
generate fiber lint that might contaminate a medical environment. PCT Publication No. WO 97/45259
discloses a breathable composite sheet material comprised of a moisture vapor
permeable thermoplastic film adhered to a fibrous substrate. The breathable
thermoplastic film is primarily comprised of a polymer material selected from the group
of

An absorbent article (250) comprising:

(a) a topsheet (249);
(b) a backsheet (247) formed from a moisture vapor permeable, liquid
impermeable composite sheet material (10) said composite sheet material

comprising;

(i) a first fibrous nonwoven web having a first side and an opposite
second side;
(ii) a second fibrous nonwoven web having a first side and an opposite
second side, the first side of said second fibrous nonwoven web

abutting the second side of said first fibrous nonwoven web

said first (16) and second fibrous nonwoven webs (14) each being powder-bonded
webs wherein the fibers of said first and second-fibrous webs are bonded to

one another by a synthetic powder adhesive permeating said first
and second nonwoven fibrous webs, and wherein the first and second

fibrous nonwoven webs are bonded to each other by said adhesive; and
(iii) a moisture vapor permeable thermoplastic film (12) bonded to the
second side of said second fibrous nonwoven web;

wherein:

(I) at least 90 weight percent of the fibers in said first fibrous
nonwoven web are compatible with said adhesive:
(II) between 25 and 75 weight percent of the fibers in said
second fibrous nonwoven web are compatible with said

adhesive and said thermoplastic film;
(III) between 75 and 25 weight percent of the fibers in said
second fibrous nonwoven web are incompatible with said

adhesive and said thermoplastic film; and
(IV) at least 50 weight percent of the polymer in said
thermoplastic film is compatible with said adhesive; and
(c) an absorbent core (275) located between said topsheet and said backsheet.
The absorbent article (250) of Claim 1, wherein the weight of the fibers in said second
nonwoven fibrous web (14) is between 1/4 and 4 times the weight of the fibers in said

first nonwoven fibrous web (16). 
The absorbent article (250) of Claim 1, or 2, wherein:

(a) said adhesive is a polyester polymer or polyester copolymer adhesive;
(b) said moisture vapor permeable film (12) is comprised of at least 75% by
weight of polymer selected from the group of block copolyether esters, block

copolyether amides, copolyether imide esters, polyurethanes. polyvinyl
alcohol, and combinations thereof;
(c) at least 90 weight percent of the fibers in said first fibrous nonwoven web (16)
are made of polymer selected from the group of polyester polymers and

copolymers;
(d) between 25 and 75 weight percent of the fibers in said second fibrous
nonwoven web (14) are made of polymer selected from the group of polyester

polymers and copolymers; and
(e) between 75 and 25 weight percent of the fibers in said second fibrous
nonwoven web (14) are made of polymer selected from the group of

polyamides, polyolefins, acrylics, and cotton.
The absorbent article (250) of Claim 3, wherein said polyester polymers and
polyester copolymers in said fibers are selected from the group of poly(ethylene

terephthalate), poly(1,3-propylene terephthalate) and copolymers thereof.
The absorbent article (250) of any of Claims 1 - 4, wherein said moisture vapor permeable
film (12) is comprised of at least 75% by weight of block copolyether esters.
The absorbent article (250) of Claim 5, wherein said moisture vapor permeable film (12)
