<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for obtaining ridge
line pattern image on a curved surface of an object.Means for identifying individuals through fingerprint or palm
print images has been proposed wherein a fingerprint(or a palm
print) image is obtained and is automatically compared with
previously stored images using pattern recognition technique.Heretofore, for obtaining a palm print image, printing ink
applied on a surface of a palm is transcribed on a sheet to print a
palm picture. A palm print image is obtained from the palm picture
by a TV camera or by an image scanner. Although a same method has
been used for obtaining a fingerprint image, an apparatus has
recently been disclosed for obtaining a fingerprint image without
using printing ink. This apparatus which has been disclosed by U. S.
Patent Number 5,096,290 entitled "Apparatus for Imaging
Fingerprint using Transparent Optical Means having Elastic Material
Layer"(hereafter will be called the prior art) may also be used for
obtaining a palm print image when a surface for placing an object
is broad enough for a palm.Fig. 2 shows an assembly of the prior art apparatus for
obtaining an image pattern of a palm print.Light beams from a light source 13 incident upon a surface 22
of an optical body 21, are totally reflected at the surface 22 of
the body 21, due to the difference of refractive index between the
optical body 21 and the surrounding air. When a part of a palm of a 
hand 23 is in contact with the surface 22, light beams are scattered
in a diffused reflection at the contact point. A TV camera 14 is
placed at a position for scanning light beams of total reflection
and a part of diffused light beams reflected in a direction parallel
to the light beams of total reflection, to produce ridge line
pattern image of a palm on the surface 22. The surface 22 on which
an object is placed in contact is hereafter called a platen.Poor contact between an object and the platen is a serious
problem of the prior art. As is evident from Fig. 2, only a small
portion of the total palm area is in contact with the platen 22.
When pressure from the hand 23 is increased to increase contact
area, the portion which has already been in contact with the platen
receives excessive pressure and the ridge lines in the portion can
be depressed or the palm itself can be deformed resulting in an
inaccurate image pattern.As an attempt to circumvent this problem, US 3,906,520 discloses a method which employs a fiber optic imaging block having a partially cylindrical,

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for obtaining ridge line pattern image on a
curved surface of an object comprising:


an optical body (12) having a curved platen surface, which fits 
together with said curved surface of said object for making a good

contact between these two curved surfaces,
a light source(13)placed at a point where light beams from said
light source receive a total reflection at a boundary between said

platen and an air space, and receive a diffused reflection at a
boundary between said platen and said object;
a light receiving unit (14) placed at a point where light beams
of total reflection do not come in sight of said unit; and
a coordinates compensator (19) for converting pixel positions
obtained by said light receiving unit to desired pixel positions in

an output image memory,

wherein said optical body (12) has a plane perpendicular to a normal
line of said curved platen surface at a predetermined point, and

said light receiving unit is placed at a point with its light axis
coincident with said normal line.
An apparatus for obtaining ridge line pattern image of claim 1,
wherein said light receiving unit (14) is a TV

camera.
An apparatus according to claim 1 or 2,
 
   wherein said light receiving unit is an image

scanner (71).
An apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 3,

   wherein said curved platen surface is coated by a
transparent elastic film having a refractive index same with that

of said optical body.
