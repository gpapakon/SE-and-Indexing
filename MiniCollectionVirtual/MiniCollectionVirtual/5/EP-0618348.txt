<ABSTRACT>
A bit holder (10) for a cutting tool utilizes a non-rotatable sleeve 
(26) which is slit (36) its entire 

length axially and is force-fitted into the bore (20) of the bit holder 
(10). The sleeve (26) is 

removable in the field and provides protection for the bit holder (10). 
In an alternate 

embodiment the sleeve is provided with additional retaining means (44) 
in the form of a 

circumferential flange (46) which extends beyond the bit holder (10) and 
contacts the rearmost portion thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of S.N. 07/976,741, Filed November 16, 
1992. This invention relates to bit holders for cutting tools and more particularly to a non-rotatable 
sleeve for use with such bit holders. In the mounting of cutting tools via bit holders, which bit holders may be mounted 
on drums for rotation (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,749,449) it is occasionally 
desirable to mount the cutting bit through the intermediary of a sleeve, which can be 
a different material from the bit holder and more able to sustain the cutting 
environment without damage. Further, depending upon the application, it may be 
desirable to mount the sleeve so that it is rotatable about its longitudinal axis or to 
so mount it so that it is non-rotatable. In the case of non-rotatable mounting it is 
generally appropriate to employ a sleeve which is friction-fitted into an appropriate 
aperture in the bit holder. When the sleeve is too tightly fitted, replacement in the 
field (which may be in a mine) becomes difficult. The prior art has addressed this 
problem in several ways. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,836,614 a device is described which 
protects the entire bit holder bore; however, it is not cost effective to manufacture 
since a separate sleeve must be attached to each tool. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,201,421 a 
split sleeve of spring steel or like material is employed; however, this sleeve must 
be inserted with the cutting bit and, likewise, removal of the cutting bit requires 
removal of the sleeve, whether it needs replacement or not. U.S. Pat. No. 5,088,797 
provides a friction-fitted sleeve which has limited engagement with the internal 
surface of the bit holder bore to aid in removal. This sleeve requires considerable 
machining, both before and after heat treatment, to provide the .002" to .005" 
tolerances required to make it work well. This is an expensive consideration. U.S. 
Pat. No. 5,098,167 suggests the use of threaded sleeves to avoid rotation; however, 
this also adds to the cost and time of replacement. U. S. Pat. No. 4,247,150  
 
provides for the use of an oil channel between the sleeve and the inner surface of 
the bit holder bore, with means for injecting oil under pressure to aid in removal. 
This solution also requires extra machining and added cost. U. S. Patent Nos. 
3,865,437 and 4,084,856 dislcose rotatable tools or sleeves having a plurality of 
projections formed at one end to engage the rearmost portion of a tool holder. 
These tools are expensive to manufacture since the

<CLAIMS>
A bit holder for rotatably mounting a cutting bit, said cutting bit 
comprising: an elongated member having a cutting element at one end thereof and a 

substantially cylindrical shank at the other end thereof; said bit holder comprising a 
body having an axial bore therein having at least one given diameter and a 

particular inside surface configuration; and a non-rotatable, diametrically 
compressible sleeve mounted in said axial bore, said sleeve being mounted prior to 

the insertion of said cutting bit, a collar at one end thereof having a diameter much 
larger than said given diameter whereby said collar engages a face of said body and 

limits the axial penetration of said sleeve into said axial bore, and additional 
retaining means formed at an opposite end, said retaining means extending beyound 

said bore, said sleeve having an outer surface configuration intimately matching said 
particular inside configuration and substantially in engagement therewith over its 

length, said sleeve having a diameter larger than said given diameter before 
insertion into said axial bore and a compressed diameter substantially matching said 

given diameter after insertion into said axial bore, said sleeve being provided with 
an axial slot which runs its entire length, said slot having a width which decreases 

upon insertion into said axial bore and provides said compressed diameter. 
The bit holder of Claim 1 wherein said retaining means comprises a 
circumferential flange, continuous about said given diameter, except for said slot. 
The bit holder of Claim 2 wherein said flange has a diameter about 
between 1 and 2.5% of said given diameter.
