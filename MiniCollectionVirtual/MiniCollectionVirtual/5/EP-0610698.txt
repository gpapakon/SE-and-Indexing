<ABSTRACT>
Substituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines and benzimidazoles are prepared by reacting imidazo[4,5-b]
pyridines or benzimidazoles with appropriately substituted benzyl halides. The substituted imidazo[4,5-b]pyridines or benzimidazoles can be employed as active ingredients in medicaments, in particular for the treatment of arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis.
