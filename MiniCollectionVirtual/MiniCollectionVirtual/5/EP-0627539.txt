<ABSTRACT>
In an openable window frame of the type where a 
pane (6) is fixed between an external frame member (1) 

and an internal glazing bead (8), a pasquil operating 
device with a rotary handle (22) for actuating a latch 

bar (15) via a transmission device (30) between opening 
and closing positions and latch members (37) for 

engagement with a striking plate (18) on the corresponding 
main frame member (20) is received in its entirety 

in the glazing bead (8). The transmission device 
comprises a single coupling link (30) between a coupling 

arm (28) connected with the rotary handle and a laterally 
displaced point on the latch bar (15). At the 

assembly, the latch bar (15) and the latch members (37) 
are arranged in a U-shaped portion (9) of the glazing 

bead (8), while the operating handle (22) is mounted 
between two plate members (24, 25) which are retained 

in the glazing bead (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an openable window frame 
in which edge portions of a pane or plate 
member are fixed between an external frame member and 
a separate internal glazing bead connected therewith, 
and having an operating device comprising a rotary 
handle mounted on one of said external and internal frame members for actuation of a 
latch bar via a transmission device for longitudinal 
movement of the latch bar between opening and closing 
positions, whereby latch members in connection with the 
latch bar are brought out of and into engagement, 
respectively, with a striking plate mounted in a 
corresponding main frame member against which the glazing bead abuts in the closed position of the window, wherein the transmission 
device comprises a single coupling link with a 
relatively short effective arm length between a first 
rotary connection having a coupling arm rigidly connected 
with the rotary handle and a second rotary 
connection with a point on the latch bar laterally 
displaced in relation to the rotary handle. For provision of a pasquil operating device 
suitable for light frame structures, DK patent application 
No. 2065/90 describes an operating device of the 
above type in a compact design which is considerably 
less bulky than conventional pasquil mechanisms and thus 
causes only a minimum weakening of the frame member in 
which it is mounted. However, also this compact device 
requires the provision of a groove or recess in the 
frame member for receiving the latch bar and the transmission 
device and for serving as a housing for the 
operating device. Through a further development of this known compact 
embodiment of a pasquil mechanism, it is an object of 
the invention to provide a substantially simpler 
assembly of such a mechanism in an openable frame of the  
 
type indicated above, without any kind of strength-wise 
weakening of the frame structure, especially, but not 
exclusively, for use in connection with light frame 
structures of extruded aluminium or plastics profiles. With this object in view, according to the invention, 
an openable window frame of the type indicated is 
characterized in that the glazing bead is formed as an 
extruded profile bead, the cross section of which 
comprises a substantially U-shaped portion with an 
opening facing the corresponding main frame member, and 
is retained in a track of an inwardly projecting flange 
part of the external frame member, and that the operating 
device with rotary handle, latch bar, latch members, 
and

<CLAIMS>
An openable window frame in which 
edge portions of a pane or plate member (6) are fixed 

between an external frame member (1) and a separate 
internal glazing bead (8) connected therewith, and 

having an operating device comprising a rotary handle 
(22) mounted on one of said external and internal frame members (1, 8) for actuation of a 

latch bar (15) via a transmission device (30) for 
longitudinal movement of the latch bar (15) between 

opening and closing positions, whereby latch members 
(37) in connection with the latch bar (15) are brought 

out of and into engagement, respectively, with a 
striking plate (18) mounted in a corresponding main 

frame member (20) against which the glazing bead (8) abuts in the closed position of the window, wherein the transmission device 
comprises a single coupling link (30) with a relatively 

short effective arm length between a first rotary 
connection (29) having a coupling arm (28) rigidly 

connected with the rotary handle and a second rotary 
connection (31) with a point on the latch bar (15) 

laterally displaced in relation to the rotary handle 
(22),
characterized
 in that the glazing bead (8) 
is formed as an extruded profile bead, the cross section 

of which comprises a substantially U-shaped portion (9) 
with an opening facing the corresponding main frame 

member (20), and is retained in a track (12) of an inwardly 
projecting flange part (3) of the external frame member 

(1), and that the operating device with rotary handle 
(22), latch bar (15), latch members (37), and transmission 

device is received in its entirety in the 
glazing bead (8) with the latch bar (15) and the latch 

members (37) positioned in said U-shaped portion (9),
