<ABSTRACT>
A fluid pressure relief system and method for a pressure vessel or tank (10) having a normal vent (16) with a first pilot operated safety valve (18) and an emergency vent (62) having a second pilot operated safety valve (25). A vapor recovery line (20) is connected to relief valve (18) and collected at a vapor storage container (21). A manway (22) on the pressure vessel (10) (shown in Figure 2) defines the emergency vent (62) and a main valve member (66) has a counterweight (74) thereon to urge main valve member (66) to a seated closed position on nozzle (60). The first pilot operated safety valve (18) for the normal vent (16) (is shown in Figure 7) and has a T-shaped body (142) with a main relief valve member (172) at one end of the body (142) mounted for movement in a generally horizontal direction and controlled by a diaphragm (176) at an opposite end of the body (142).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid pressure relief system for pressure vessels,
such as tanks, and more particularly to such a fluid pressure relief system utilizing
pilot operated relief valves and the method for providing the relief system.Heretofore, pilot operated relief valves have been utilized on pressure vessels,
such as tanks, such as shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,705,065 (which forms a basis for the preamble of the claims 1 and 8) dated November 10,
1987, for example, in the opening and closing of a main relief valve member and
including the opening of the main valve member under a vacuum condition.
However, the main relief valve has not functioned independently of the pilot valve
such as may be necessary for a severe service and corrosion environment. The main
valve member is in a fail open position in the event of any malfunctioning of the pilot
valve.Present pilot operated relief valves can be operated at pressures very near the
set pressure without leakage, and general seat tightness under all conditions is
superior because of the high seating loads. Weighted and spring loaded relief valve
members, however, are very simple and provide consistent reliability for users. Pilot
valves which also provide excellent reliability, except under extreme service
conditions, are more complex in operation but have superior performance.Pilot operated relief valves are particularly useful for low pressure vessels
designed for a pressure under 15 psi. Such low pressure vessels are required to have:
(1) a normal vent (usually small in orifice size) that limits the pressure rise due to
either the addition of liquid to the vessel or the increase in vessel vapor space
operating ambient temperature, (2) a normal breather (usually small in orifice size)
that limits the vacuum on the vessel caused by removal of liquid from the vessel or
a reduction in vessel vapor space operating ambient temperature, and (3) an
emergency pressure vent (usually large in orifice size) that relieves the pressure in a
vessel in the event the tank is subjected to fire or the like. Present code requirements
for a low pressure vessel do not permit the setting of a valve above the maximum 
allowable working pressure (MAWP). Full relief capacity for the emergency vent
may be at a pressure of 20% above the MAWP.Heretofore, pilot operated relief valves have been utilized with the normal vent
of a pressure vessel and upon opening of the main valve member under control of the
pilot, fluid vapors have normally been vented to atmosphere. Recent
