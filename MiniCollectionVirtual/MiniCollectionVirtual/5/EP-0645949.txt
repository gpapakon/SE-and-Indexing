<ABSTRACT>
The object of the invention is to prevent the flow of molten solder 

to the adjacent input electrodes and to prevent short-circuiting between 
electrodes as well as wire breakage from happening by performing a 

process for avoiding the concentration of shearing stress applied to the 
input electrodes. 
The lengths of the slit 26 for the input electrodes 28 are made 
uneven. The input electrodes 28 and the board electrodes 30 are laid 

over one another. When they are heated, the solder 32 is melted, thereby 
securing the electrodes 28 and 30. The molten solder 32 flows between 

the base 22 and the board 18A by capillary action. This flow of solder 
to the adjacent input electrodes 28 is prevented by forming the convex 

sections 26A at the lengths of the slit 26 so as to make it uneven to 
make the base 22 connecting the adjacent input electrodes 28 non-linear. 

Moreover, in cases of relative motion of the liquid crystal cells 16 and 
the boards 18A and B, independent deformation becomes possible at the 

joint section between the convex sections 26A and separate input 
electrodes 28, thereby avoiding the concentration of shearing stress and 

increasing the strength.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a film printed circuit board in which 
long, narrow electrodes, which are provided at a board opening, are laid 
over other electrodes, these latter electrodes being coupled with solder, 
as well as a liquid crystal display in which liquid crystal cells and 
wiring boards are connected through a film printed circuit board. In liquid crystal displays, a plurality of data lines and gate 
lines from liquid crystal cells, which are composed of a pair of glass 
substrates and liquid crystal which is sealed between these glass 
substrates, are connected with an integrated circuit and on/off switching 
is controlled by this integrated circuit, thereby displaying images. The integrated circuit is mounted on a board which uses a TAB (tape 
automated bonding), for connecting liquid crystal cells and wiring 
boards In a TAB, circuit patterns, including integrated circuits, are 
printed on a film base (For example, polyimide), and the electrodes on 
the output side of the integrated circuit are connected with the 
electrodes of said liquid crystal panel body. Moreover, an FPC (Flexible 
Printed Circuit), etc., can be considered as a wiring circuit board. In this state, the electrodes on the input side of the integrated 
circuit and the electrodes of said wiring board are electrically 
connected by soldering. As shown in Figure 7, the electrodes 102 on the input side of the 
conventional TAB 100 are bridged in long, narrow forms parallel to each 
other by printing between the opposing lengths of the slit openings 104 
(dimension of long side: L; dimension of short side: W) provided on the 
TAB 100 so that the heat of the soldering iron is sufficiently conveyed. 
In Figure 8 (B), the input electrode 102 is shown only in the opening 
104, but in reality, the extended section of the input electrode 102 is 
printed on the bottom surface of the TAB 100. With the compactness of a 
liquid crystal display and functional advancement, the precision of the 
pitch dimension of this input electrode 102 becomes higher. Some with  
 
the input electrodes of 0.25 mm in width, and a gap between the input 
electrodes 102 of about 0.25 mm have already been materialized. A number of electrodes 108 similar to said input electrodes 102 in 
shape are arranged opposite the input electrodes 102 on the surface of 
the wiring board 106. The solder 110 has been applied on these board 
electrodes 108 in advance. When the TAB 100 and the wiring board 106 are overlaid in this 
state, the input electrodes 102 and the basic
