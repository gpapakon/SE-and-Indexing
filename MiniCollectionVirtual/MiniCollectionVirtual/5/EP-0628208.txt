<ABSTRACT>
A helical tape recording and reproducing system using three longitudinally oriented tracks (172, 174, 176) that are located adjacent the helical recording area (170) where the user data is recorded (and is also digitally recorded). One of them is a physical address track (174) and it is used for recording physical address data relating to the physical layout of the tape. It contains data which identifies the size and spacing of any system zones that have been defined, as well as the volume, the format used and the absolute number of each double frame that is to be recorded or which has been recorded. Another one is a logical address track (172) that contains data relating to the content of the recorded helical tracks. Each of the logical and physical address tracks has recorded segments each of which containing data corresponding to a particular pair of helical tracks. The third longitudinal track is a servo track which contains servo information for use by the tape transport servo system to control the direction and speed of movement of the recording and reproducing system during various operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
Various parts of the preferred embodiment described herein 
constitute the subject-matter of copending European patent 
applications Nos. 93904619.9 (published as WO-A-9317426); 
93904618.9 (WO-A-9317430); 93903582.0 (WO-A-9317419; 
93904560.5 (WO-A-9317421); 93904631.4 (WO-A-9317423); 
93904556.3 (WO-A-9317425); 93904549.8 (WO-A-9317429); 
93904537.3 (WO-A-9317420); 93903608.3 (WO-A-9317424); and 
93903609.1 (WO-A-9317432). The present invention relates to mass storage devices, and 
more particularly, to recording and reproducing apparatus 
and methods for achieving very high density recording of 
digital information at very high transfer rates.  
 The market for mass storage devices is growing at what seems to be an ever 
increasing rate with the sales of high-performance computers penetrating numerous industries 
ranging from financial institutions to oil exploration companies. The processing power of these 
high-performance systems, and the data they generate, are increasing faster than the ability of 
storage devices to keep pace. The problem of data storage and rapid retrieval is particularly 
pronounced in computational-intensive applications which create huge amounts of data that need to 
be accessed in seconds rather than minutes, hours or even days. Magnetic disks remain the preferred media for direct access to frequently used files 
because of their fast access times. However, because of their high cost per-unit of storage (such 
as a megabyte) and their limited capacity, magnetic disk recorders are prohibitively expensive and 
therefore impractical for large-scale data storage. With the advances ip magnetic tape technology, 
tape based systems remain the preferred choice for mass data storage. In addition to cost, 
magnetic tape exceeds the storage density of any other medium, at least from a volumetric 
standpoint, because tape is a much thinner medium than, for example, magnetic disks, and tape 
can be tightly packed. A general discussion of such technology may be found in Mass Storage 
Technologies, by S. Ranada, published in 1991 by Meckler Publishing. The tape format basically defines the recording path used to record signals on the 
tape. There are many different recording formats developed for data recording and reproducing. 
A commonly used format for high capacity systems is IBM's 3480 multi-track tape cartridge 
format in which the tape transport employs a stationary head and records data along longitudinal 
tracks. Since the late 1970's rotary head helical scan recorders, a
