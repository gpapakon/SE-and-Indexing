<ABSTRACT>
A modular solid-state radar transmitter apparatus for producing waveforms whose 
amplitude may be varied over time. The transmitter achieves pulse modulation on either 

an intrapulse or pulse to pulse basis, while at the same time reducing stress on individual 

solid-state modules. Intrapulse modulation and pulse to pulse modulation can be produced 
with the disclosed modular solid-state transmitter because the number of modules and the 

sequence in which they are activated is selectable. These selections provide the various 
desired levels of transmitted power and thus effectively achieve modulation. In order to 

achieve this intrapulse modulation, a variable combiner is introduced whose coupling factor 
is coordinated with the module activations. In one embodiment, variable combining is 

accomplished by the use of RF switching logic for combining pairs of signals in parallel. In 
this case, RF switches are programmed to act as a conventional combiner when all 

modules are active. When a module is deactivated, the switches are set so that the active 
modules are connected to the output or the next stage of combining. Another embodiment 

uses a series approach to accomplish such variable combining. Here, when all modules 
are active RF switches and phase shifters are programmed for performance as in a 

conventional combiner. When a module is deactivated, the phase of the signals within each 
coupler section is adjusted by means of RF amplifier programming and phase shifters to 

avoid loss in the termination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to wave shaping systems for producing waveforms of variable
amplitude. The invention is particularly useful for radar systems employing solid-state
amplification means in the transmitter.Radar is used to detect and locate remote objects by the reflection of radio waves. This
is accomplished by transmitting a signal of a known waveform and observing the nature
of the received echo. Traditionally, the radar waveform has usually been a repetitive train
of short-duration pulses all of a constant amplitude. There are certain applications for radar,
however, where the production of a pulse train or waveform having varying degrees of
amplitudes is advantageous. For example, tracking of objects can be improved through the
use of a radar system which is capable of producing variable waveforms. This is because
such systems are less susceptible to jamming and other types of Electronic Counter
Measures (ECMs).The desirability of varying a waveform's shape, also known as pulse shaping, is discussed
in Chapter 27 of RADAR TECHNOLOGY by Brookner entitled "EFFICIENT SPECTRUM
CONTROL FOR PULSED RADAR TRANSMITTERS". Here, waveform control or spectrum
control is discussed in the context of meeting Electro-Magnetic Compatibility (EMC)
requirements which are now commonly specified on radar equipment, e.g., MIL-STD-469.
Techniques are considered to improve the efficiency on shaped pulses for the Traveling
Wave Tube (TWT) and Klystron Tube Transmitters. With these techniques, a reasonable
efficiency can be achieved, however, the complexity in the design of the power supplies
for the tubes is greatly increased. This translates into a significant cost increase which has
prohibited widespread implementation. Without the help of complex and expensive power supplies, tube transmitters have
significant problems when they are run in any state other than saturation. As such, they are
seldom operated except in that manner. Thus, with only this single mode of operation, tube
transmitters have little capability to vary the power transmissions of the pulses. One way
of varying the power is to form a series or sequence of transmitter tubes called a
transmitter chain. Again, such a method is prohibitive because of its cost.The amplitudes of pulses from tube transmitters may also be controlled at IF and
microwave frequencies by using a PIN diode as an attenuator or switch. For example, a
PIN diode can be configured in shunt to an output RF signal so that when the diode is zero
biased the signal will be
