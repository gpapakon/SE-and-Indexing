<ABSTRACT>
Improvements in air guns of the hinged barrel type, with a 
barrel (28) acting as a lever arm of a hinged leverage (5) 

to compress a spring (4) attached to an axially movable 
piston (1), tightly inserted in a compression chamber (2), 

with thrusting means (5) associated to said piston for 
compressing said spring and a safety catch (6) which locks 

said piston in a spring compressed position suitable for 
shooting. The improvements consists in producing said 

piston (1) in a tubular shape moulded in plastic material, 
including tightness means (8,11), a supplementary element 

resistant to wear providing a link between said piston, 
said thrusting means (5) and said safety catch (6), and a 

supplementary weighty element (10), integral to said 
tubular piston. A casing (27) completely covers the barrel 

(28) body excepting its front and rear ends and each of the 
two lateral sides of said rear end (29) of said casing 

(27), bear ample recesses (31), apt to snugly fit, in the 
closed position of the gun, upon corresponding projecting 

ridges (32) of the inner wall of each one of the limbs of 
a fork (30a) pertaining to a one-piece body extending 

rearwards thereby forming said compression chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to improvements in air guns
mainly of the hinged barrel type where the barrel acts as
a lever arm of a hinged leverage operable to compress the
spring of a compression chamber mounted on the buttstock
body of the gun, including an axially movable piston,
located inside said compression chamber associated to the
gun body, said piston being in contact with said loading
spring and comprising means, generally in a material
different from that of the piston, adapted to secure the
tightness between its external surface and the internal
wall of the compression chamber, said piston being further
associated with thrusting means, in order to compress said
spring, as well as to a safety catch which locks the piston
in a spring compressed position suitable for shooting. The
preamble of claim 1 is based on EP-A-0 467 819.An example of a state of the art air gun is
disclosed in EP-A-467819 of same inventor wherein the
invention mainly consists in a particular embodiment of a
fork-shaped piece, hinged on the barrel, an its locking on
the compression chamber end, as well as the features of a
casing of plastics material moulded on the barrel, with a
back part thereof pivotally hinged with a fork member
constituted by a one-piece body moulded as well in plastics
material, with a rearward extension which is integral with
the front part of said compression chamber, there being an
axial passage extending through said rearward extension for
the passage of the compressed air.The invention is defined in claim 1. The dependent claims define preferred embodiments.It is still with the aim of reducing the cost of
manufacture of said guns, that the inventor sought to 
improve the production of some parts of the gun reforming
several aspect which essentially affect:
the piston, which is still in metal, and of its
tightness means, with respect to the compression
chamber which is generally constituted by O-rings
located within annular grooves on the piston external
surface, or alternatively by nozzle-shaped joints (see
GB-A-2173287) socketed on the front end of said piston
and whose production cost is very high;the tightness of said guns because, in all the cases
when using additionally parts of the O-ring type or
nozzle-shaped joint, the air can pass through both
sides thereof, on one hand, through its surface in
contact with the compression chamber and, on the other
hand, through its surface in contact with the piston
recess;the means for alignment of the barrel with an axial
passage for the outlet of the
