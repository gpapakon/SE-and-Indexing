<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder head gasket (1) includes two pieces of gasket base plates (3) providing
a combustion chamber hole (3A), and a spacer (4) arranged surrounding a cylinder bore

(2) in an endless manner and is held between the gasket base plates. Each gasket base
plate has a full-bead portion (3a) and a half-bead portion (3b) within a range thereof that

superposes on the spacer (4). The spacer, the full-bead portion and the half-bead portion
are held continuously along the circumferential direction of the cylinder bore between

the cylinder head (5) and the cylinder block (6). Due to the spacer, the full-bead portion
and the half-bead portion are press-contacted to the opposing member with a high surface

pressure and over a relatively wide contact area. Therefore, a favorable sealing
performance is obtained despite the presence of a cavity or a scar in the junction surface

of the opposing side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an engine having a cylinder head, a cylinder block and a cylinder head
gasket.A cylinder head gasket is known in the art comprising a pair of
gasket baseplates held sandwiched between a cylinder head and a cylinder
block and having a combustion opening formed therein in alignment with a
cylinder bore, a spacer disposed around the cylinder bore to surround it in
an endless manner and held sandwiched between the pair of gasket
baseplates and a full bead and / or half bead formed at a suitable location or
locations on the gasket baseplates (Japanese Laid-Open Utility Model
Application No. 71,865 / 1992 and Japanese Laid- Open Patent Application
No. 165, 167 / 1992).In the prior art, when only gasket baseplates are provided which
are formed with a full bead and a half bead, they are readily susceptible to
the influence of any blowhole in the casting or flaw on mating adjoined
surface, causing likelihood that the sealing performance becomes degraded.An engine according to the preamble of claim 1 is known
from JP-A-07-253 162.In view of the foregoing, the invention provides an engine with a cylinder head
gasket which assures and maintains a good sealing performance in the 
presence of any blowhole in the casting or flaw on the
mating adjoined surface.According to the present invention there is provided
an engine having a cylinder head, a cylinder block in
which is formed a plurality of cylinder bores, and a
cylinder head gasket sandwiched between the cylinder head
and the cylinder block, the cylinder head gasket
including a pair of gasket baseplates having combustion
openings formed therein in alignment with the cylinder
bores, a spacer disposed around each combustion opening
to surround it in an endless manner and sandwiched
between the pair of gasket baseplates, and, for each
combustion opening, a full bead and a half bead formed on
each of the gasket baseplates in the regions thereof
overlapping the spacer, characterised in that, for each
combustion opening, the spacer, the full bead and the
half bead on each gasket baseplate are continuously held
sandwiched between the cylinder head and the cylinder
block around the cylinder bore with both the full bead
and the half bead on each gasket abutting against the
spacer, and the half bead being disposed radially
outwardly of the full bead away from the cylinder bore.With the described arrangement, the full bead and
the half bead on each of the gasket baseplates disposed
around the combustion chamber opening are held sandwiched 
between

<CLAIMS>
An engine having a cylinder head (5), a cylinder
block (6) in which is formed a plurality of cylinder bores

(2), and a cylinder head gasket (1) sandwiched between the
cylinder head (5) and the cylinder block (6), the cylinder

head gasket (1) including a pair of gasket baseplates (3)
having combustion openings (3A) formed therein in alignment

with the cylinder bores (2), a spacer (4) disposed around
each combustion opening (3A) to surround it in an endless

manner and sandwiched between the pair of gasket baseplates
(3), and, for each combustion opening (3A), a full bead

(3a) and a half bead (3b) formed on each of the gasket
baseplates (3) in the regions thereof overlapping the

spacer (4), 
characterised in that
, for each combustion
opening (3A), the spacer (4), the full bead (3a) and the

half bead (3b) on each gasket baseplate (3) are
continuously held sandwiched between the cylinder head (5)

and the cylinder block (6) around the cylinder bore (2)
with both the full bead (3a) and the half bead (3b) on each

gasket baseplate (3) abutting against the spacer (4), and
the half bead (3b) being disposed radially outwardly of the

full bead (3a) away from the cylinder bore (2). 
An engine as claimed in claim 1 and further
including, for each combustion opening (3A), a reinforcing

plate (11) of a thickness less than that of the spacer (4)
and disposed radially outwardly of the spacer (4) away from

the bore (2), the reinforcing plate (11) being held
sandwiched between the pair of gasket baseplates (3).
An engine as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 in
which at least one of the cylinder head (5) and the

cylinder block (6) is formed as an open deck with cooling
water passages (5a,6a) which, for each combustion opening

(3A), surround the spacer (4) and the full (3a) bead and
the half bead (3b) on each gasket baseplate (3).
An engine as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3
in which each full bead (3a) includes a centre portion

extending away from the spacer (4) in the direction of the
thickness of the spacer (4).
An engine as claimed in claim 1 in which the
spacers (4) around each combustion opening (3A) are

integrally connected together to be continuous with each
other. 
An engine as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5
