<ABSTRACT>
An article carrier for an automobile includes a plurality of parallel 
slats (12) fixedly secured on a generally horizontally extending 

exterior automobile body surface (10). A pair of bracket members (16) 
are disposed upon selected slats (12) and a restraining bar extends 

laterally between and secured adjacent its opposite ends to the bracket 
members (16). A latching mechanism (44) is disposed within each of the 

bracket members (16) and cooperates with the slat (12) for detachably 
securing and longitudinally adjusting the bracket members (16) and the 

restraining bar upon the slats (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article carrier for an 
automotive vehicle, more particularly to, an adjustable cross bar for 
an article carrier on an automotive vehicle. Automobile luggage racks frequently employ two separate sub 
assemblies or portions: a rectangular framework which surrounds the 
load to be carried and a plurality of slats which rest on the roof or 
other automobile body surface and carry the weight of the load. In 
such constructions, the framework and the slats are often secured to 
the automobile body independently of one another. In still another 
automobile luggage or article carrier, a cross bar replaces the 
framework as the means for confining the luggage upon the slats. In US-A-4 182 471 there is 
disclosed an 
article carrier for automotive vehicles having cross bars which can be 
adjusted on the slats and are easily removed, interchanged or adjusted 
in position on the slats in accordance with the needs of the user. 
This construction has achieved significant commercial success. 
Nevertheless, some problems have been experienced in providing an 
aesthetically more pleasing and simple to use bracket. Therefore, it 
is believed that a need exists for a crossbar which has an attractive  
 
appearance of modern luggage carriers but which possesses a 
degree of adjustability and ease of operation. US-A-4 982 886, upon which the preamble of claim 1 is 
based, also discloses an article carrier. According to the present invention there is provided 
an article carrier for an automobile, comprising: 
a plurality of slats fixedly secured on a generally 
horizontally extending exterior automobile body surface; a pair of bracket members disposed upon selected ones 
of said slats; a restraining bar extending laterally between and 
secured adjacent its opposite ends to said bracket members, 
said restraining bar being located above the automobile 
body surface and said slats, and each said selected slat 
including a plurality of selectable longitudinally spaced 
apertures extending through a wall of said slat disposed 
generally parallel to the automobile body surface; and a locking assembly on each of said bracket members 
for cooperating with said apertures of said selected slats 
for detachably securing and longitudinally adjusting said 
bracket members and said restraining bar upon said selected 
slats, each locking assembly including a latching member 
and an associated manually operable actuating member, said 
latching member being disposed generally perpendicular to

An article carrier for an automobile, 
comprising: 


a plurality of slats (12) fixedly secured on a 
generally horizontally extending exterior automobile body 

surface (10); 
a pair of bracket members (16) disposed upon selected 
ones of said slats (12); 
a restraining bar (14) extending laterally between 
and secured adjacent its opposite ends to said bracket 

members (16), said restraining bar (14) being located above 
the automobile body surface and said slats (12), and each 

said selected slat including a plurality of selectable 
longitudinally spaced apertures (32) extending through a 

wall (28) of said slat disposed generally parallel to the 
automobile body surface (10); and 
a locking assembly (56,44) on each of said bracket 
members (16) for cooperating with said apertures (32) of 

said selected slats (12) for detachably securing and 
longitudinally adjusting said bracket members and said 

restraining bar (14) upon said selected slats, each locking 
assembly including a latching member (44) and an associated 

manually operable actuating member (56), said latching 
member (44) being disposed generally perpendicular to the 

automobile body surface (10) and including a shoulder 
portion (48) formed thereon and protruding generally 

laterally of said latching member, and its associated said 
actuating member (56) being moveable linearly generally 

parallel to said selected slats (12) and generally 
perpendicular to its associated said latching member (44) 

for cooperating with said associated latching member to 
cause or permit movement of said latching member into and 

out of engagement with said apertures (32); 
each said actuating member (56) including a sloped 
portion (70) adapted to engage an undersurface of the  

 
shoulder portion (48) of its associated said latching 

member (44), said sloped portion (70) being arranged to 
urge said associated latching member out of latching 

engagement with one of said apertures (32) when said 

actuating member (56) is moved linearly in a first 
direction, and to allow said latching member (44) into 

engagement with said one aperture (32) when said actuating 
member is moved linearly in a second direction; 
 
   characterised in that said sloped portion (70) of 

each said actuating member (56) extends into an upper 
horizontal portion (68) onto which the shoulder portion 

(48) of its associated said latching member (44) is 
slidable when said actuating member (56) is moved fully in 

said first direction, to hold its associated said latching 
member (44) in a position in which it is out of latching 

engagement with a said aperture (32). 
The article carrier of claim 1, wherein the 
sloped portion (70) of each said actuating member (56) 

includes a pair of sloped surfaces (70) each adapted to 
engage the undersurface of the shoulder portion (48) of its 

associated said latching member (44), said associated said 
latching member extending between said two sloped surfaces. 
The article carrier of claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein each locking assembly further includes a biasing 

member (50) for biasing one end of its said latching member 
(44) into engagement with a said aperture (32). 
The article carrier of any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said actuating member (56) has a generally 

L-shaped configuration, a handle portion (62) adapted to be 
grasped and manually moved by an operator, a horizontal 

wall (60) and a vertical wall (58), said handle portion 
being connected to said vertical wall. 
The article carrier of any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein the sloped portion (70) of each said 

actuating member (56) also extends into a lower horizontal 
portion (66) at the opposite end of the sloped portion to  

 
its said upper horizontal portion (68). 
The article carrier of any one of the preceding 
claims, wherein said shoulder portion (48) of each said 

latching member (44) includes a camming surface (54) 
cooperable with the sloped portion (70) of its associated 

actuating member (56) to move said latching member 
vertically as said actuating member is moved. 
The article carrier of claim 6, wherein each 
said upper horizontal portion (68) includes a detent (74) 

for receiving the camming surface (54) of its associated 
said latching member (44) to prevent further movement of 

said latching member. 
The article carrier of claim 7 when dependent 
on claim 5, wherein each said lower horizontal portion (66) 

includes a detent (72) for receiving the camming surface 
(54) of its associated said latching member (44) to prevent 

further movement of said latching member.
