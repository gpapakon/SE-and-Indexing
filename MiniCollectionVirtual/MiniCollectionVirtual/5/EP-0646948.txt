<ABSTRACT>
A resin packaging method resin-packages a lead 
frame having predetermined electronic elements thereon 

such that the efficiency of utilization of a resin for 
resin packaging can be greatly improved, occurrence of 

defects, e.g., voids and chipping in the packaging 
portions, can be prevented, preheating of the resin is 

enabled, thus preventing early wear of components 
associated with supply of the resin, and the number of 

components to be replaced for alteration of the type of 
electronic elements to be resin-packaged can be largely 

decreased, thereby shortening the time required for 
replacement of a mold. This method includes the first 

step of preparing a thermosetting resin material to 
substantially match the inner shape of a runner 

elongated in a horizontal direction, the second step of 
positioning and holding the lead frame on upper surface 

portions of a plurality of cavities, which form female 
portions for resin packaging at substantially axial-symmetric 

positions thereof with respect to the 
longitudinal direction of the horizontally elongated 

runner through gates, the third step of flowing the 
thermosetting resin, the fourth step of simultaneously 

filling and feeding with pressure the thermosetting 
resin material toward the cavities by a movable runner.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a resin packaging 
method, and an apparatus and a mold for the same, and 
more particularly, e.g., to a resin packaging method 
for resin-packaging, with a resin, a semi-completed 
product obtained by mounting predetermined electronic 
or electric elements, e.g., semiconductor elements and 
resistors, on, e.g., a lead frame, and an apparatus for 
the same. Conventionally, various types of apparatuses are 
proposed that package, by using a thermosetting resin, 
a semi-completed product obtained by mounting 
semiconductor elements, resistors, and the like on a 
lead frame. For example, Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open 
No. 56-30841 discloses an arrangement in which 
semiconductor elements are sealed or encapsulated with 
a resin. This proposal will be briefly described with 
reference to the accompanying drawing. Fig. 17 is a 
plan view of a mold seen from above its parting line, 
in which the mold is partially cut away along a plane 
extending along the parting line of the cavity.  Referring to Fig. 17, a material inlet portion 
called a pot 104, to which a preheated thermosetting 
resin, e.g., an epoxy resin is supplied, is formed at 
the central portion of the upper die. One plunger (not 
shown) having a large size is movably provided in the 
pot 104. When the plunger performs a pressing 
operation, the thermosetting resin is supplied to 
runners 105A to 105E communicating with the pot 104 and 
into cavities 107 through gates 106 formed to branch to 
the right and left from longitudinal portions of each 
runner. A plurality of cavities 107 are formed in each 
cavity block 117, as shown in Fig. 17. In the above arrangement, lead frames, on which 
predetermined electronic elements have been mounted, 
are positioned and set on a lead frame mounting portion 
provided on the parting line of the mold, and the mold 
is closed. Thereafter, a preheated thermosetting 
resin, e.g., an epoxy resin, is pressed into the pot 
104 with the plunger, thereby supplying the 
thermosetting resin into the cavities 107 through the 
respective runners. Then, after the resin is hardened, 
the mold is opened. Portions of the cavities 107 and 
the respective runners 105A to 105E indicated by hollow 
circles are pressed with ejector pins (not shown), so 
that an integral product of a cull portion hardened in 
the pot 104, the runner portions hardened in the  
 
respective runners 105A to 105E, and package portions 
hardened in the cavities 107 to contain the lead frames 
is extracted from the
