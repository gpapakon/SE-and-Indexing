<ABSTRACT>
A method of heating a liquid which comprises providing a mandrel (12) within a heating element (14) having at least one surface, and passing the liquid down the mandrel in the form of a thin film (22) in such a manner that it does not contact the heating surface (14). This may be carried out in apparatus which comprises a heating element (14) within which is located a mandrel (12), not in contact with the element, a source of liquid (18), and means (20) for allowing the liquid from the source to flow over the mandrel (12) in the form of a thin film (22). The mandrel (12) will normally be maintained in a vertical orientation and the source of liquid (18) may be at the top thereof. The liquid is allowed to run as a film (22) down the surface of the mandrel (12). The mandrel (12) is surrounded by the hot surface of the heating element (14) and heat passes principally by radiant heat across the gap (16) between the hot surface of the heating element (14) to the liquid passing down the mandrel (12). Thus there is no direct contact between the liquid to be heated and any heated surface of the heating element (14). The mandrel (12) itself will normally not be heated and, indeed, it may be made from materials having good corrosion and release properties but a thermal conductivity so poor that they would not normally be used in heat exchanger manufacture. It need not be made from metal, and may, for example, be made from materials such as ceramics or glass, optionally with release coatings of, for instance, PTFE.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for heating 
liquids, and in particular to a method of apparatus for heating 
liquids in an indirect manner. Liquids are commonly heated by allowing them to flow over a hot 
surface but some fluids are very difficult to heat in this way. 
For example, many (such as some biological fluids) deposit 
layers of solid material on the heat transfer surface which 
then act as insulation impeding the further flow of heat to the 
liquid. This tendency, referred to as fouling, may be reduced 
to some extent by various stratagems but nevertheless remains 
a considerable problem. The invention seeks to provide a method and apparatus of 
heating liquid improved in the above respects. US-A-4,164,441 describes an apparatus for heating and 
separating a corrosive liquid using two spaced concentric 
tubes. The liquid is made to flow over the inner surface of 
the inner tube and hot flue gases contact the outside of the 
outer tube. In this arrangement, the heat is transmitted 
through the walls of the tubes from the hot gases to the 
liquid. French patent 2129118 describes a water heater in 
which hot gases are made to flow in a turbulent manner over the 
outer surface of a cylinder whilst giving up its heat across a 
reservoir wall to water contained in a reservoir surrounding 
the inner cylinder. According to the present invention there is provided a method 
of heating a liquid which comprises providing an unheated 
mandrel within a heating element having at least one heating 
surface such that there is a gap between the mandrel and the 
heating element, characterised in that the liquid passes down 
the surface of the mandrel in the form of thin film and in such 
a manner that it does not contact any heated surface of the  
 
heating element but is heated by heat passing across the gap 
from the heating surface of the heating element to the liquid. The invention also provides an apparatus which comprises having 
at least one heating surface within which is located an 
unheated mandrel such as to define a gap between the mandrel 
and the heating element and a source of liquid, characterised 
in that there is provided means for allowing the liquid from 
the source to flow over the surface of the mandrel in the form 
of a thin film and in such a manner that it does not contact 
any heated surface of the heating element but is heated by heat 
passing across the gap from the heating surface of the heating 
element to the liquid. The mandrel will normally be maintained in a
