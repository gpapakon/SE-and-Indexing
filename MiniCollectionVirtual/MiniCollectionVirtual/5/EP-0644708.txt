<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a radiant heater for a cooker with hobs, in particular with glass-ceramic (vitroceramic) cooking plates with at least one heating resistor, which lies in turns on an insulation carrier in depressions, in particular a heating meander which is supported in holding elements. The insulating body (1) is provided with webs (5) whose inner edges (8) and outer edges (9) extend at different measures of angular degree from the groove floor (base) (7). The measure of angular degree of the slots (4) which extend down to the groove floor (7) is at a ratio with respect to the measure of angular degree of the outer edges (9) such that the heating meander is forced to assume an inclined position when it is spread open in a defined manner. In the insulating body (1) there are furthermore provided receiving channels (11) into which the holding elements (3) are inserted. In order to increase the stability, the holding elements (3) are nested inside one another and provided with corresponding guiding slots (16) and projections (overhangs) (21). The holding element (3) which is at the top in the sequence of assembly is connected to the insulating body (1) via one or more clamps (15), this resulting in all holding elements (3) being held reliably on the insulating body (1).
