<ABSTRACT>
A method for isolating filamentous phages capable 
of binding biotin, essentially characterized by the 

following operations: 

biotinylation of a protein used for the 
screening of a phage library, in which, on the surface 

of the capsid, are expressed oligopeptides coded by 
random sequence oligonucleotide inserts, introduced 

into a gene coding for a protein of the phage capsid 
using genetic manipulation techniques; 
screening the above library using the 
biotinylated protein; and 
isolating the phages capable of binding to 
biotin. 
Figure 1 shows, in the form of a histogram, the 
binding of biotinylated proteins to phages selected 

according to the method of the invention and 
immobilized on plastic.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention has as its subject a method 
according to which, using a highly biotinylated 
protein, it is possible to select phages capable of 
binding biotin. As is known, biotin is a small molecule (MW 244) 
that can be conjugated to a number of macromolecules 
without altering their size, physical characteristics 
and biological activity. Biotin has high binding 
affinity with both avidin and streptavidin. This 
interaction is used in a number of technological 
applications for the detection and purification of 
biotinylated molecules. However, the use of avidin and/or streptavidin, in 
spite of the high biotin binding activity of these 
molecules, shows several disadvantages. The most 
important of these disadvantages can be summarized as 
follows. First of all, avidin binds a number of cell 
types in a non-specific manner, and can also be 
internalized, which may limit its use in cytochemical 
methods. Secondly, extremely drastic conditions are 
required to dissociate the avidin/biotin bond, which 
limits its use for affinity purification. Anti-biotin 
antibodies have been produced as alternative reagents; 
but these can also cause non-specific binding 
phenomena. For all the reasons given above, there is in this 
specific sector a need for a new type of reagent, 
capable of binding biotin without causing the problems 
and limits indicated above. The method according to the present invention 
allows a new type of reagent to be produced, which 
offers certain advantages that will be seen from the  
 
following. Subject of the present invention is therefore a 
method for isolating filamentous phages capable of 
binding to biotin, essentially characterized by the 
following operations: 
biotinylation of a protein used for the 
screening of a phage library, in which, on the surface 
of the capsid, are expressed oligopeptides coded by 
random sequence oligonucleotide inserts, introduced 
into a gene coding for a protein of the phage capsid 
using genetic manipulation techniques; screening the above library using the 
biotinylated protein; and isolating the phages capable of binding to 
biotin. The gene coding for the phage capsid, with random 
sequence oligonucleotidic inserts, can be the gene 
coding for the protein pVIII or the gene coding for the 
protein pIII of the phage capsid. In a specific embodiment of the invention, the 
random sequence oligonucleotides are inserted in the 
gene coding for the protein pVIII, using the plasmid 
pC89 as an expression vector, from the recognition site 
fo
