<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a logistical system for a tank wagon, having a tank wagon underframe (1) and a large-volume tank (2) which can be detachably mounted thereon or two small-volume tanks (2a,2b) which can be detachably mounted thereon. The invention is based on the object of providing a design of tank wagons which fulfils the requirements for greater flexibility and a better utilization of the carrier vehicles and of the tanks. The object is achieved in that a tank-wagon logistical system is provided which has a tank-wagon underframe (1) and a large-volume tank (2) which can be detachably mounted thereon or two small-volume tanks (2a,2b) which can be detachably mounted thereon, with stop brackets (4,4a,4b) on the tank-wagon underframe (1) which act in the longitudinal direction and tank stop brackets (3,3a,3b) on the tank (2,2a,2b), the stop brackets (4,4a,4b) of the tank-wagon underframe (1) being constructed and arranged in such a way that they are suitable both as stops for the tank stop brackets (3) of the large-volume tank (2) and as stops for the tank stop brackets (3a,3b) of the two small-volume tanks (2a,2b) which are assigned to one half of the tank-wagon underframe (1).
