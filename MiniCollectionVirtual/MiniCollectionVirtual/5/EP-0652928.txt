<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPLEX ALKOXY BORATES OF ALKYLATED PHENOLS AS LUBRICANT STABILIZERSThis application is directed to additive products which are effective for stabilizing oil and grease compositions and to oil and grease compositions containing same. The subject products are derived from the reaction of alkylated phenols with alcohols and suitable boronating substances.Borate esters of hindered phenols have been utilized in the prior fuel and lubricant art. For example, U.S. Patent RE 32,295 discloses that borate esters of hindered phenols are hydrolytically stable and possess antioxidant properties as fuel or lubricant additives. U.S. Patent 4,507,216 further discloses that hindered phenyl esters of cyclic borates are useful in reducing the friction resulting when two surfaces are in sliding or rubbing contact.U.S. 4,698,169 is directed to products made by reacting an alkenyl succinic compound with an arylamine, an alkanolamine, a monoaminomethane, a hindered alcohol and borated reaction products thereof which provide dispersant and antioxidant characteristics to lubricant compositions.U.S. 4,389,322 discloses the use of borated adducts of ethoxylated amides as a component of lubricating oils or greases.U.S. 4,328,113 discloses that borated amines as friction reducers in lubricants or lubricating oils.However, no art is known to Applicants that discloses the complex alkoxy borates of alkylated phenols as disclosed herein.This invention is directed to complex hydrocarbyloxy borates of hydrocarbyl phenols as lubricant stabilizers. This invention is more particularly directed to alkoxy borates of alkylated phenols as effective stabilizers for gear oil and 

grease compositions. This invention is further directed to lubricant and to grease formulations having increased dropping points containing the additive products of reaction in accordance with the invention. An object of this invention is to provide improved lubricant compositions and greases having superior stability under diverse service conditions and also to provide greases with increased dropping points.In general, alkylated monohydric and/polyhydric phenols are reacted with an alcohol and a boronating agent to give compounds of the following structure:Suitable hydrocarbyl phenols may contain from 1 to about 300 carbon atoms or more, i.e., up to about 10,000 carbon atoms, in the hydrocarbyl group (R) , preferred are C_ to about C_2, and the phenols may be monohydric or polyhydric and X is 1 to about 20 and preferably 2 to 8. They may be obtained commercially or
