<ABSTRACT>
An air bag module structure comprises a pair of subassemblies 
which are coupled together to form the module. The 

subassemblies comprise an air/bag cover subassembly (34) and an 
inflator/reaction device subassembly (36). The air bag cover (24) has an 

air bag cavity, a folded air bag (22) disposed within the cavity, and 
a rim (42) surrounding an access opening that communicates with the 

air bag cavity. The air bag has a gas inlet opening (49) surrounded 
by a border portion (48) of the air bag (22), which is adapted to be 

secured to the rim (42) of the cover. The inflator/reaction device 
subassembly (36) has an inflator housing (26) with gas dispensing 

nozzles, 
a gas generating composition within the housing, and an integral 

reaction device (28) extending outward of the inflator housing. The 
reaction device (28) is secured to the rim (42) of the cover (24), 

and couples 
the inflator/reaction device subassembly (36) with the air bag/cover 

subassembly (34). When the subassemblies are coupled together, the 
gas dispensing nozzles are in fluid communication with the air 

bag gas inlet opening.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an air bag module
structure and to techniques for forming the air bag module
structure. The air bag module comprises a pair of assemblies
which are coupled together to form the module. One structure
comprises a folded air bag/cover subassembly. The other
structure comprises an inflator/reaction device subassembly. The
subassemblies are separately formed, and then connected with each
other to complete an air bag module.A vehicle air bag module is a complete air bag unit
which is assembled apart from the vehicle and then coupled as a
unit with the vehicle. Typically, an air bag module includes (i)
a reaction device, (ii) a folded air bag connected to the
reaction device, (iii) an inflator, or gas generator, connected
to the reaction device, and (iv) a cover connected to the
reaction device to complete an enclosure for the folded air bag.
The module is generally coupled with a structural part of the
vehicle via the reaction device. In the case of a passenger side
air bag module, for example, the reaction device may be coupled
with the support structure for the instrument panel of the
vehicle. Alternatively, in the case of a driver side air bag
module, the reaction device may be coupled with the steering
wheel support structure.When coupled with a vehicle, an air bag module operates
to deploy an air bag at the onset of a vehicle collision.
Specifically, at the onset of a collision, a chemical mixture in
the inflator that forms part of the module is ignited to generate 
large quantities of gas under relatively high pressure. The gas
simultaneously (i) forces the air bag through the cover and (ii)
inflates the air bag. As the air bag is being inflated,
relatively high forces are applied to the various components of
the air bag module. The reaction device transmits such forces to
the vehicle structure to stabilize the air bag module during
deployment of the air bag.Over the years, various techniques for forming air bag
modules have been suggested. One well known technique comprises
initially securing an air bag and an inflator with a reaction
device, folding the air bag into a predetermined pattern relative
to the inflator and the reaction device, and then attaching a
cover to the reaction device. The reaction device is adapted to
be coupled with a structural part of the vehicle, to couple the
module with the vehicle. One example of such a technique is
shown in U.S. Patent 4,148,503, wherein an air bag module
comprises an inflator and an air bag secured to a reaction device
or
