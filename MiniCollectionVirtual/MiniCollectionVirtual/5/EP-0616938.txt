<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a securing device for the horizontal securing of interchangeable bodies (swap bodies) and/or containers on a railway wagon, for example a piggyback car, having longitudinal supports (1) which run along the two outer longitudinal sides and have an upper flange (2), supporting plates (3), which can be hinged in bearings and are provided with locking pegs, being provided for the interchangeable bodies and/or containers to be placed on. According to the invention, the upper flange has a recess in the region of each supporting-plate bearing (3), into which recess a mechanical supporting structure (6, 9) of the bearing is fixedly inserted, one spindle (7) of the bearing being arranged within the supporting structure (6, 9) along the upper edge of the upper flange (2) and the lower side of the supporting plate (3), which is mounted pivotably on the spindle (7), extending inwards, in an in-use position, below the upper edge of the upper flange (2) through the recess.

<CLAIMS>
Longitudinal load-bearing member (1) for the
outer longitudinal sides of railway carriages, in particular

piggyback carriages, having a top flange (2) and
at least one securing means for at least horizontally

securing interchangeable superstructures and/or containers
on the loading surface of the railway carriages,


bearing locations (5) for swing-action load-bearing
plates (3) provided with twistlock bolts (4)

being provided in the region of the top flange, and
it being possible, by pivoting in the bearing
locations, for the load-bearing plates to be swung away

out of a use position - in which they extend inwards,
from the outer edge of the loading surface, for

supporting the interchangeable superstructures and/or
containers and are supported, by means of their under-side,

in the region between the mount and the twistlock
bolts, while the latter project upwards beyond the

loading surface of the carriage - into a rest position
outside the area bounded by the longitudinal load-bearing

members,

characterized in that a recess is provided in the top
side of each longitudinal load-bearing member (1), in the

region of the bearing location (5), and has a mechanical
load-bearing structure (6, 9) of the bearing location (5)

introduced fixedly in it, in that a spindle (7) of the

bearing location (5) is arranged, within the load-bearing
structure (6, 9), along the top edge of the longitudinal

load-bearing member (1), and in that, in the use position,
the underside of the load-bearing plate (3) of the

securing means, said plate being mounted pivotably on the 
spindle (7), extends inwards, through the recess, beneath

the top edge of the longitudinal load-bearing member (1).
Longitudinal load-bearing member with securing
means according to Claim 1, characterized in that the

spindle (7) extends in a single piece over the length of
the recess and - as seen in the longitudinal direction of

the railway carriage - is located, at least in part,
within the outline formed by the longitudinal load-bearing

member (1).
Longitudinal load-bearing member with securing
means according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in that

each load-bearing structure (6, 9) comprises at least two
jaws (6), which are fastened on the end sides of the

recess and between which the spindle (7) and a bar (9),
which is arranged parallel to the latter, extend, the bar

(9) resting on the base of the recess in the longitudinal
load-bearing member (1) and forming, by means of its top

side, a support for the underside of the load-bearing
plate (3) in a region between the spindle and the

twistlock bolt (4).
Longitudinal load-bearing member with securing
means according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that the load-bearing plate (3) is designed as
a bending bar with, as seen in side view, an outline

which tapers continuously from the bearing location (5)
to the twistlock bolt (4).
Longitudinal load-bearing member with securing
means according to Claim 4, characterized in that the

load-bearing plate (3) has a hollowed cross-section in
the region between the bearing location (5) and the

twistlock bolt.
Longitudinal load-bearing member with securing
means according to one of the preceding claims, characterized

in that, at its bearing-side end, the load-bearing
plate (3) is provided with an open mouth (12)

which can be fitted onto the spindle.
Longitudinal load-bearing member with securing
means according to Claim 6, characterized in that there

is a closure element (13) which can be connected fixedly 
to the load-bearing plate (3) and is intended for closing

the mouth (12) after the latter has been fitted onto the
spindle (7).
Longitudinal load-bearing member with securing
means according to Claim 6, characterized in that there

are releasable means, in particular screws, for closing
the mouth (12) after the latter has been fitted onto the

spindle (7).
