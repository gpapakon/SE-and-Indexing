<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an operating-mode switch (function selector) for electrical appliances, especially electric cookers, which is arranged in a service panel accessible to the user. The purpose is to isolate the components in the appliance which are driven by high current and by low current. There is now only a low-current-driven control part of the operating-mode switch arranged in the service panel, whereas the true switching function, namely switching the energy supply to the loads (consumers), is carried out using a motor-driven component at another location on the appliance. The switching correlation between the control part and the switching part of the operating-mode switch is provided by two encoding switches, the pulses of which are checked in a comparator. As long as no agreement exists between the pulses of the encoding switches, the motor for the switching part is supplied with current and thereby turns cam discs and eccentric discs which switch the loads.

<CLAIMS>
Function selector (1) for electrical appliances, in 
particular electric cookers, which is located in a 

control panel accessible to the user,
 
characterized in that 


in the control panel only the control component of the 
function selector (1) is located, this control component 

having an input code switch (1a) with a code disk (2) 
for the production of position-dependent continuous 

pulses, 
in that furthermore a motor (3) is provided for driving 
one or more cam disks or cam plates (4) for switching 

the consumers (6a,6b,6c) associated with the various 
functions, 
in that furthermore a monitoring code switch (7) is 
coupled with the cam disks or cam plates (4) which also 

produces position-dependent continuous pulses, and 
serves to detect the actual position of the cam disks 

or cam plates (4) and 
in that finally a comparator (9) is provided which 
compares the pulses of the two code switches (1a, 7) and, 

in the case of a non-match, switches on the motor (3) 
until it detects the matching of the specified pulses. 
Function selector according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
in an electric cooker several or all of the following 

functions can be switched on individually or in 
combination by way of the function selector (1): cooking 

area; baking oven: upper and/or lower heat, circulating 
air; grill; automatic cleaning. 
Function selector according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
as regards the code disks (2, 8) of the two code switches 

(1a, 7), cyclic codes, in particular a Gray code, are used.  
 
Function selector according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
one cam disk or cam plate (4) is provided with as many 

switching points, or as many cam disks (4) each having 
one switching point are provided, as there are possible 

functions. 
Function selector according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the cam disks (4) are combined on a cam drum (4a). 
Function selector according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the comparator (9) detects a matching of the code values 

of the two code switches (1a, 7) only when the switches 
(5a,5b,5c) for the consumers are positively switched. 
Function selector according to Claim 6,
 
characterized in that
 
the cam disk(s) or cam plates(s) (4) with their 

switching points are offset spatially - and consequently 
temporally - in the sense of an advance in relation to 

the code disk (8) of the monitoring code switch (7). 
Function selector according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that,
 
between the input code switch (1a) and the comparator 

(9), a programme control unit (12) is connected which 
allows the function to be switched on and off and/or 

changed by programme control. 
Function selector according to Claim 8,
 
characterized in that
 
the programme control unit (12) is additionally acted 

upon by sensors (14), which monitor the course of the 
programme in the appliance within the individual 

functions.  
 
Function selector according to Claims 1 or 8,
 
characterized in that
 
the motor (3) is designed to run forwards and backwards. 
Function selector according to Claims 9 and 10,
 
characterized in that,
 
by means of the programme control unit (12) controlled by 

the sensors (14), a clocking of the power supply to the 
consumers takes place by switching on and off of the 

function selector (1) (forward/backward running of the 
cam disk(s) or cam plate(s) (4)).
