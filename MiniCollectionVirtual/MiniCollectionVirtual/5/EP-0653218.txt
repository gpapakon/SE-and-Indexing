<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for atomising, distributing and mixing liquid or pulverulent substances by means of a stream of compressed gas, and it is particularly intended for the production of aerosols for inhalation purposes. A nozzle head (5) working on the Venturi principle is used to produce an aerosol from material to be atomised and stored in a container (1). An extended deflector shield (4) is provided at the level of the opening of the nozzle head and at the lower end of a chimney (3) for the supply of air. In order to form a labyrinth guide there is a cylindrical insert (7) which establishes an annular gap around the chimney (3). The proportion of aerosol particles (diameter about 0.5 to 5  mu m) that can reach the lungs is considerably increased by the extension of the deflector shield.

<CLAIMS>
Device for atomising, distributing and mixing liquid or
powdered materials by means of a compressed gas stream, in

particular for inhalation purposes, with

a receptacle (1) for the atomisation product (16),
a nebuliser hood (2) which can be mounted on the
receptacle,
an atomiser nozzle (5) which is arranged centrally in
the receptacle and in which the pressure medium

conducted in a compressed gas channel draws in the
atomisation product via intake channels whose nozzle

openings are arranged adjacent to the nozzle opening
of the compressed gas channel,
a flue (3) for the entry of fresh air into the
interior of the device, which is arranged coaxially

with the atomiser nozzle,
a gas stream rudder (6) which is arranged in the
outlet cone of the compressed gas opposite the nozzle

opening of the compressed gas channel and near the
opening plane and is wedge-shaped on the side

opposite the nozzle opening,
an insert (7) for deflecting the aerosol stream,
which, forming an annular gap, is arranged around the

flue, and
a baffle screen (4) which is arranged at the lower
end of the flue and extends into the atomisation

chamber,

characterised in that
the baffle screen (4) comprises an essentially
rotationally symmetrical extended section (4a) which

is arranged at the level of the opening plane of the
atomiser nozzle (5) and whose diameter (D) is 1 to 4

times the height thereof (H).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the
diameter (D) of the extended section (4a) of the baffle

screen (4) is 1.25 to 2.5 times the height thereof (H).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the extended section (4a) of the baffle screen (4) is

cylindrical.
Device according to claim 3, characterised in that the
extended section (4a) of the baffle screen (4) is

connected by a conical section (4b) to a cylindrical
insert (4c) which is adapted to the flue (3).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the extended section (4a) of the baffle screen (4)

comprises a chamfer at its end extending into the
atomisation chamber.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 5, characterised in
that the insert (7) is rotationally symmetrical and

comprises an edge flange, a wall portion which tapers
frustoconically upwards into the atomisation chamber and

whose edge is drawn inwardly in a direction towards the
flue, forming a rim, and between edge flange and wall

portion an outwardly projecting lip for fixing the insert
to a correspondingly shaped edge of the receptacle and/or

of the nebuliser hood.
