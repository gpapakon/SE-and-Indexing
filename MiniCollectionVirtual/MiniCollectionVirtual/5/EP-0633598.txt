<ABSTRACT>
A pair of magnetic members (13) are provided on an 
outer surface of a neck tube (11) in a horizontal plane 

including three electron beams generated from an in-line 
type electron gun (12) so as to sandwich the three 

electron beams. The in-line electron gun (12) is enclosed 
in the thin cylindrical neck tube (11) extending to the rear 

portion of a funnel glass (9). The magnetic members (13) are 
disposed in an axis direction of the electron gun (12) so 

that at least parts thereof face each other. Providing 
the magnetic members (13) in this way suppresses the occurrence 

of the Lorentz force due to the interaction 
between the two outermost electron beams among the 

three electron beams and the external magnetic field (8) in 
the axis direction of the electron gun (12). Therefore, 

misconvergence of the electron beams caused by the 
Lorentz force is prevented.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color
cathode ray tube having an in-line type electron gun.A color cathode ray tube (hereinafter, referred
to as a color CRT) employing an in-line type
electron gun is used in TV sets, computer monitors, and
the like. In such a color CRT, in order to make three
electron beams emitted from the electron gun converged
on a screen, the directions of the respective outermost
electron beams are changed so as to approach the center
electron beam in the electron gun, as disclosed in, for
example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 1-29299. The
convergence of the electron beams is described with
reference to Figure 1.Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view of an
electron gun 12 provided inside a typical color CRT and
a glass panel 7 provided in front of the color CRT.
The electron gun 12 includes cathodes 1a, 1b, 1c for
emitting electrons and electrodes 3 composed of first
to fourth grid electrodes G1-G4 disposed in front of
the cathodes 1a, 1b, 1c. Intensity and focusing of
electron beams 2a, 2b, 2c emitted from the cathodes 1a,
1b, 1c are controlled by applying different potentials
to each of the grid electrodes G1-G4.Hereinafter, control of the electron beams
2a, 2b, 2c is further described in detail. The electron beams 2a, 2b, 2c corresponding
to red, green and blue are emitted from the cathodes
1a, 1b, 1c, respectively. The electron beams 2a, 2b,
2c travel through the first to fourth grid electrodes
G1-G4. After traveling through apertures 5 which are
formed on a shadow mask 4 having a color selecting
function, the electron beams 2a, 2b, 2c reach a phosphor
screen 6 provided on the inner surface of the
glass panel 7 so that phosphor materials emit light.
Although not shown in Figure 1, a deflection yoke (see
Figure 3) is disposed between the electron gun 12 and
the glass panel 7. The deflection yoke deflects the
electron beams 2a, 2b, 2c so as to scan the phosphor
screen 6.Moreover, in order to obtain an image of high
quality, it is necessary to obtain sufficient convergence
of the electron beams 2a, 2b, 2c on the phosphor
screen 6. For this purpose, the through-holes of the
second to fourth grid electrodes G2, G3, G4 through
which the electron beams 2a and 2c travel are made
eccentric among the grid electrodes G2, G3, G4 so as to
form the gradient of the electric field. Thus, the
directions of the respective outermost electron beams
2a and 2c on each side are changed by the gradient of
the electric field among the grid electrodes G2, G3, G4
so as to gradually approach the central
