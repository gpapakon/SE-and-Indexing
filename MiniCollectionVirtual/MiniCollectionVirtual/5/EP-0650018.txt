<ABSTRACT>
First, nitrogen oxides are reduced by firing coal (18) in 
substoichiometric air conditions in a first stage oxidation unit of 

a combustor (10) to reduce NO
x
 from fuel bound nitrogen. 
Hydrated lime, 

Ca(OH)₂ (26), is introduced into the first stage oxidation unit to 
produce calcium sulfide. The calcium sulfide becomes tied up in a 

slag eutectic which is removed prior to entry of the fuel gas to a 
second stage oxidation unit at the entrance of a furnace where 

additional preheated air (44) is added to the fuel gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for the desulfurization of
carbonaceous fuels. More particularly, it refers to an improved
method for removing sulfur through the use of alkali sorbents in a
combustion process and for the reduction of nitrogen oxides and
particulate emissions from the combustion of coal.US-A-4,395,975 and 4,423,702 describe methods for
capturing sulfur in an alkaline molten slag produced from the
partial oxidation of coal and reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides
and particulate from the coal combustion process. These methods
accomplish their intended purpose, but do not remove all the sulfur
and nitrogen oxides.However, WO-A-8 203 111 is the closest prior art.Further research has continued on the development of processes
to provide low capital and operating cost cleanup alternatives for
utilities and industries currently burning coal. An improved
process is needed that will accomplish these results.We have discovered a more economical process employing a coal
combustor to reduce Nox and further remove sulfur and slag in the
combustor itself to reduce the quantity of pollutants entering a
coal fired furnace.Alkali compounds, such as limestone, lime, hydrated lime,
dolomite, trona, nacholite, potassium carbonate or combinations 
thereof are added with coal being fired in a first stage oxidation
unit of a combustor, or are added separately into the first stage.High levels of sulfur capture are achieved in an alkali molten
slag produced from the partial oxidation of the coal by
incorporating a combustor design insuring that all of the oxygen
from the oxidizing media (air, oxygen or a combination thereof) is
completely consumed prior to entering the alkaline molten slag
sulfur capture zone.Nitrogen oxides are reduced by firing the coal in substoichiometric
air conditions in the first stage to reduce NOx
produced from fuel bound nitrogen. Slight inter-cooling prior to
the second stage of combustion reduces the second stage combustion
temperature, thereby reducing thermal NOx production.In a second stage oxidation unit at an entrance to a furnace
heated combustion air is mixed slowly with the fuel gases from the
first stage. Slow mixing, in conjunction with flame radiation
cooling in the furnace proper reduces localized oxidation zone
temperatures. Thermal NOx production is reduced because thermal NOx
production decreases with decreasing flame temperature.The invention may be best understood by those having ordinary
skill in the art by reference to the following detailed description
