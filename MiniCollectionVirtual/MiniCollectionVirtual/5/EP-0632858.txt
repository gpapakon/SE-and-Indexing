<ABSTRACT>
The present application discloses control apparatus for controlling application of line marking material to refurbish an old line pattern on a pavement surface, said control apparatus comprising a first line detector mounted in use at a forward position whereby a first predetermined width of said pavement surface substantially greater than said old pattern width is transverse scanned with information indicative of said old line pattern viewed by said first line detector being retained over a first predetermined length of said pavement surface in the direction of said old line pattern, a second line detector mounted in use rearwardly of said first line detector, said second line detector in use being arranged to transverse scan a second predetermined width of said pavement surface substantially greater than the width of said old line pattern with information indicative of said old line pattern viewed by said second line detector being retained over a second predetermined length of said pavement surface in the direction of said old line pattern, said first line detector producing a lateral shift control signal indicative of lateral shift of said old line pattern as sensed with said lateral shift control signal being adapted to control lateral movement of line marking material applicator to correctly deposit said line marking material over lines forming said old line pattern, said first line detector further recognising, preferably by a neural network, transition points in said old line pattern and providing signal indicative of said transition points to said second line detector, said second line detector including a transition detector which receives the signal indicative of transition points from said first line detector and information from the transverse scan of said second line detector and in response thereto provides a control signal to control on/off conditions of said line marking material applicator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to apparatus for applying lines of
desired configuration onto a roadway or pavement surface and more particularly
to apparatus for controlling application of paint or other line marking materials to
accurately repeat previously formed lines on the roadway or pavement surface.Roadway or pavement marking lines (either centre lines or margin lines)
inevitably wear out over time and the rehabilitation of these marking lines is a
task that must be continually carried out by roadway maintenance organisations.
The length of roadways in many countries including Australia result in a need for
machinery that can accurately reform old line markings at relatively high speed
so that costs can be minimised. There are in fact many difficulties involved in
being able to accurately reform old making lines at high speed and some of
these include difficulties with distinguishing the old line itself caused by
extraneous road markings such as changes in road surface colouring, shadows,
unusual colouring areas such as oil or paint splashes, and simply in some cases
as a result of extreme wear of the old line. Moreover, changes in pattern
configurations also cause difficulties for continuous high speed reforming of old
lines.In prior patent literature there have been disclosed many proposals for
mechanising reforming of old pavement lines. Some of these are disclosed in
documents US-A-3046854, US-A-3101175, US-A-3286928 and US-A-3298352, all of which would
have various problems associated with being able to distinguish old line
markings, to be able to accurately repeat those old line markings and more
particularly, to handle changes in line patterns. In document
US-A-5,054,959 there is disclosed apparatus for distinguishing old line markings on a
roadway surface and in response thereto, correctly positioning paint applicator
guns so that paint could be applied correctly over the old line markings. This
apparatus has been used successfully but certain difficulties have arisen in
relation to recognition of old line markings including pattern changes in those
markings, particularly when operating at high speed.The objective therefore of the present invention is to provide
improvements in control apparatus for machinery of the type generally disclosed 
in US-A-5,054,959 to improve recognition of old line markings and
particularly changes in pattern formats of those line markings.Preferably it is an
objective of the present invention to enable operational speeds to be improved
by improved

<CLAIMS>
Control apparatus for controlling application of line marking material to
refurbish old line markings on a pavement surface, said control apparatus

including line detection means adapted in use to transverse scan a predetermined
width of said pavement surface substantially greater than a width of said old line

pattern while being carried forwardly in the direction of said old line pattern,

   said control apparatus being characterised in that said line detection means
includes means for comparing images derived from two image detector means,

one mounted behind the other in the direction of travel, and including image
classifier means taught through an artificial neural network to recognise line

patterns and to classify transitions in the old line marking, from one pattern to
another, and said apparatus, in response thereto, being effective to control line

marking material applicator means to repeat accurately said old line markings
including transitions in the patterns thereof, with changes of pattern being made

only if said detected line marking patterns are recognized by the control
apparatus as taught by said neural network. 
Control apparatus according to Claim 1, further characterised in that a first
one of said image detector means is mounted in use at a forward position

whereby a first predetermined width of said pavement surface substantially
greater than said old pattern width is transverse scanned,


with information indicative of said old line pattern viewed by said first
image detector means being retained over a first predetermined length of said

pavement surface in the direction of said old line pattern,
a said second one of said image detector means being mounted in use
rearwardly of said first image detector means, said second image detector means

being in use arranged to transverse scan a second predetermined width of said
pavement surface substantially greater than the width of said old line pattern,
with information indicative to said old line pattern viewed by said second
image detector means being retained over a second predetermined length of said

pavement surface in the direction of said old line pattern,
said first image detector means further recognising transition points in said
old line pattern and providing a signal indicative of said transition points to said

second image detector means, said second image detector means receiving the
signal indicative of transition points from said first image detector means and

information from the transverse scan of said second image detector means and
in response thereto, a control signal means is provided to control on/off

conditions of said line marking material applicator means.
Control apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised in that said first
image detector means further produces a lateral shift control signal indicative of

a lateral shift of said old line pattern as sensed with said lateral shift control
signal being adapted to control lateral movement of line marking material

applicator means to correctly deposit said line marking material over lines
forming said old line pattern.
Control apparatus according to Claim 2 or Claim 3, wherein said first
predetermined length of scanned pavement surface is substantially greater than

said second predetermined length.
Control apparatus according to Claim 4, further characterised in that said
first predetermined length is about five metres.
Control apparatus according to Claim 4 or Claim 5, further characterised in
that said first and second predetermined widths are between 400 mm and

1200 mm.
Apparatus for applying line marking material to refurbish an old line pattern
on a pavement surface, said apparatus including a control apparatus according to

any one of the preceding claims.
