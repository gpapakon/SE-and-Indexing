<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum nitride sintered body containing 1 to 
10 % by weight of an oxide of at least one element 

selected from a group consisting of a group IIIa element, 
Ca, Sr and Ba, the concentration of a Si component in the 

sintered body is 0.01 to 0.2 % by weight and three-point 
bending strength is 490 MPa or more. The sintered body is 

characterized in that a crystal structure composed of 
aluminum nitride crystal grains is formed, the fracture 

toughness is 2.8 MN/m
3/2
 or more, the three-point bending 
strength is 490 MPa or more and the thermal conductivity is 

150 W/m·k or more. In the crystal structure, the 
distribution of the crystal grain distribution is 

adequately adjusted. The growth of the AlN sintered body 
is restricted, thus the structure of the sintered body is 

fined, and the distribution of the crystal grain size is 
controlled adequately so that the strength and the fracture 

toughness of the sintered body are improved. Moreover, the 
mechanical strength and fracture toughness are improved 

without impairing the heat radiating characteristics of the 
aluminum nitride.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum
nitride sintered body for use as a semiconductor board or
the like and a method of manufacturing the same, and more
particularly to an aluminum nitride sintered body and a
method of manufacturing the same capable of significantly
improving strength and fracture toughness and exhibiting
excellent heat radiation characteristics while maintaining
thermal conductivity peculiar to the aluminum nitride.A ceramic sintered body having a variety of
excellent characteristics, such as strength, heat
resistance, corrosion resistance, wear resistance and light
weight and the like, as compared with the conventional
metal material has been widely used in a mechanical part,
functional part, structural material and decorative
material for forming a semiconductor board, electronic
equipment material, engine part, material for a high-speed 
cutting tool, nozzle, bearing or the like that is used in
severe temperature, stress and wear conditions under which
conventional metal materials cannot be used satisfactorily.Since an aluminum nitride (AlN) sintered body is
an insulating body having excellent thermal conductivity
and a thermal expansion coefficient near that of silicon
(Si), it has been further widely used as a heat radiation
plate or a substrate of a highly-integrated semiconductor
apparatus.The aluminum nitride sintered body has been
usually mass-produced by the following manufacturing
method. A sintering agent, an organic binder and,
if necessary, any of various additives, a solvent and a
dispersant are added to a raw material powder of aluminum
nitride. The obtained raw material powder mixture is, by a
doctor blade method or a slip casting method, molded into a
thin-plate shape or sheet-shape molded body or is
press-molded into a thick-plate or a large-size molded
body. Then, the thus obtained molded body is, in the air or
nitrogen atmosphere, heated and dewaxed so that carbon
hydride component and the like used as the organic binder
is removed from the molded body and is dewaxed. The dewaxed
molded body is, in nitrogen atmosphere or the like, heated
to high temperature so as to be densified and sintered so
that an aluminum nitride sintered body is formed.In a case where very fine raw material powder 
having an average grain size of about 0.5 µ m or less is
used as the raw material AlN powder in the foregoing
manufacturing method, a considerably fine sintered body can
be obtained even if the AlN powder is used solely. However,
a large quantity of impurities, such as
