<ABSTRACT>
In a small water treatment unit for producing drinking water and cooking water and having at least one resin-filled ion exchanger vessel (4) which has a capacity between 100 ml and 1000 ml and with which approximately 10 l to 100 l of product water can be produced respectively with one charge of regenerated resin, the ion exchanger vessel having water-permeable sieve plates at the top and bottom or having perforations provided in the upper and/or lower region of its side walls and an open water inlet and outlet, and the water inlet to the ion exchanger vessel being designed to be essentially unpressurised and in such a way that water flow through the ion exchanger vessel only occurs as a result of gravity, a regeneration station (1) is provided having an inlet line for regeneration liquid to the upper part of the ion exchanger vessel and an outlet line for exhausted regenerant from the bottom part of the ion exchanger vessel and having a hot water feed to the ion exchanger vessel for hot water between 50@C and 110@C, in particular between 80@C and 110@C. Because of the regenerability, a relatively large amount of ion exchanger resin can be used so that the water treatment can proceed more rapidly, unhygienic microbial growth in the ion exchanger resin being able to be prevented by thermal disinfection.
