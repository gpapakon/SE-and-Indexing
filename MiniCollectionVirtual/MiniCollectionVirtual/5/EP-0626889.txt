<ABSTRACT>
A fume cupboard (1) the exhaust system of which includes a two-stage vortex amplifier (5, 6) the control ports (9) of which are closed successively as the fume cupboard door (2) is raised thereby to alter the flow characteristics of the exhaust system in such a manner as to make the velocity of air entering the fume cupboard (1) substantially independent of the position of the door (2) of the fume cupboard (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
 Fume Cupboard Extraction SystemThe present invention relates to fume cupboard extraction systems.Fume cupboards as used in laboratories for the handling of materials which give off noxious fumes usually have an air/vapour extraction system associated with them. Many conventional extraction systems have a substantially constant volume flow rate.As access to the interior of a fume cupboard is by way of a sliding sash, the velocity of air entering the fume cupboard will vary inversely with the size of the opening and will be greatest when the size of the opening is at its minimum. This variation in the velocity of the air entering the fume cupboard can cause operational difficulties as well as uncomfortable draughts for users of the fume cupboard. GB 2,142,425 discloses a fume cupboard the extraction system of which includes a vortex amplifier in an exhaust duct and means for supplying a control flow to the vortex amplifier, there being a control valve arranged to vary the control flow into the vortex amplifier in response to dimensional changes in the size of the opening of a sash door into the fume cupboard so as to regulate the flow into the vortex amplifier from the exhaust duct. The control flow is supplied by a fan which is connected to control ports of the vortex amplifier via a control valve, which is linked to the sash door so that the amount of air it passes is a function of the position of the sash door of the fume cupboard.Another method of controlling the velocity of air flowing into the fume cupboard through the sash door opening is to maintain the interior of the fume cupboard 

at a constant depression relative to the exterior of the fume cupboard. To a first approximation this will keep constant the velocity of the air entering the fume cupboard irrespective of the size of the sash door opening. However, the required depression is very small (of the order of 0.5 to 1 Pascal), and in practice it is difficult to maintain such a small pressure differential consistently.According to the present invention there is provided an enclosure having an entrance aperture closed by a door adapted to provide a variable opening into the enclosure, and an exhaust duct leading from the enclosure, wherein there is included a two-stage vortex amplifier forming part of the exhaust duct, and means for so varying the total aerodynamic resistance of the two-stage vortex amplifier in response to variations in the size of the opening to the enclosure as to maintain substantially constant the velocity of gas flow

Claims
1. An enclosure having an entrance aperture closed by a door adapted to provide a variable opening into the enclosure, and an exhaust duct leading from the enclosure, wherein there is included a two-stage vortex amplifier forming part of the exhaust duct, and means for so varying the total aerodynamic resistance of the two- stage vortex amplifier in response to variations in the size of the opening to the enclosure as to maintain substantially constant the velocity of gas flow into the enclosure through the opening to the enclosure irrespective of the size of the opening to the enclosure within a given operational range of movement of the door to the enclosure.
2. An enclosure according to Claim 1 wherein the means for varying the total aerodynamic resistance of the two- stage vortex amplifier comprises a plurality of ducts leading to control ports of the two-stage vortex amplifier and means for sequentially closing off the ducts as the size of the opening to the enclosure is increased, the ducts leading to the control ports of the first stage of the two-stage amplifier being closed off first and vice versa.
3. An enclosure according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein there is included means for providing an aerodynamic resistance between the enclosure and the inlet to the first stage of the two-stage vortex amplifier so as to create a pressure difference between the enclosure and the inlet to the first stage of the two-stage vortex amplifier.
4. An enclosure according to any of Claims 1 to 3 wherein the enclosure has a sliding sash door and the 


ducts leading to the control ports of the first stage of the two stage vortex amplifier are opened or closed first as a result of the opening of the door and vice versa.
5. An enclosure according to any preceding Claim wherein each of the vortex amplifiers is arranged to have a ratio of inlet to outlet depressions of 1 to 10.
6. An enclosure according to any preceding Claim adapted to form a fume cupboard.
