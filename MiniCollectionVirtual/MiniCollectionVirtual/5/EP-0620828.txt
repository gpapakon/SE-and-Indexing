<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cyclodextrin
derivatives and to their pharmaceutical application as
clathrating agents.Cyclodextrins (CD) are a group of cyclic
homologous oligosaccharides that are obtained from the
degradation of starch by the action of the enzyme
cyclodextrin transglycosylase elaborated by the
bacterium Bacillus macerans. Published methods exist
for the production of cyclodextrin transglycosylase as
well as making and isolating the cyclodextrins.Cyclodextrins are cyclic molecules containing six
or more α-D-glucopyranose units linked at the 1,4
positions by α linkages as in amylose. As a
consequence of this cylic arrangement, the molecule is
characterized as having neither a reducing end group
nor a non-reducing end group. The molecule is represented below by schematic
formula (1) where the hydroxyl groups are shown in the
2, 3, and 6-positions of the glucopyranose units.

Variable n may be a number from 4 to 6, or higher.When n=4 the molecule is commonly known as α-cyclodextrin
or cyclohexaamylose, when n=5 the molecule
is commonly known as β-cyclodextrin or
cycloheptaamylose and when n=6 the molecule is commonly
known as γ-cyclodextrin or cycloctaamylose. When
reference is made here to "cyclodextrin", it is
intended to include the foregoing forms of cyclodextrin
as well as molecules where n>6.It is believed that as a consequence of the cylic
arrangement and the conformation of the α-D-glucopyranose
units, there is limited free rotation
about the glycosidic bonds, and the cyclodextrins exist
as conical shaped molecules with the primary hydroxyls
situated at the small end of the cone and the secondary
hydroxyls situated at the large opening to the cone.
The cavity is lined by hydrogen atoms from C3 and C5
along with the glucosidic oxygen atoms resulting in a 
relatively lipophilic cavity but hydrophilic outer
surface.As a result of the two separate polar regions and
the changes in solvent structure that occur upon
complexation, cyclodextrins have the ability to form
complexes with a variety of organic and inorganic
molecules. The formation of cyclodextrin inclusion
complexes with molecules is referred to as the
"host-guest" phenomenon.These unique properties of cyclodextrins have
resulted in their commercial application in
agriculture, water treatment, as surfactants and in
drug delivery systems. The application of
cyclodextrins in the pharmaceutical field has resulted
in time release micro encapsulation, improved
stability, and increased aqueous solubility of various
drugs.Cyclodextrin
