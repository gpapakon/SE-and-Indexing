<ABSTRACT>
Electrical Switchgear having a pair of main electrodes in contact in a first ON 
position, an arcing electrode electrically connected to and rigidly connected to one of 

the main electrodes and a resilient contact element electrically connected to and 
resiliently mounted with respect to the other main electrode. 
In operation the main electrodes move relative to one another from the first ON 
position through a second intermediate position to a third OFF position where, in the 

intermediate position the resilient contact element is in contact with the arcing electrode 
and in the OFF position the first and arcing electrodes are out of contact with the 

second electrode and resilient contact element. The switchgear being arranged such 
that the main electrodes can be moved from the third OFF position to the first ON 

position without the resilient contact element contacting the arcing electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrical switchgear, and particularly to circuit breakers. Circuit breakers have to stop current flow in a circuit as rapidly as possible in the 
event of an accident or overload. A problem encountered by circuit breakers, 
particularly when stopping high current flows, is arcing as the circuit breaker opens and 
the circuit is broken. Such arcing can cause considerable damage and while the arc 
exists current continues to flow in the circuit, preventing rapid shut off. One known 
method of dealing with this problem is to provide separate main and arcing contacts in 
electrical parallel and to separate the main contacts before the arcing contacts to open 
the circuit breaker. This ensures that arcing occurs only between the arcing contacts 
which can be designed to withstand arcing while the main contacts can be designed 
purely for good current transmission. There are two main problems with this arrangement, the first is caused by the 
fact that it is normal to place an arc extinguishing coil adjacent to and in electrical series 
with the arcing contacts so that the magnetic field generate by the coil helps extinguish 
the arc. Although the use of such a coil is necessary to ensure rapid arc extinction and 
has been used in known circuit breakers of this type for safety, the presence of a large 
reactive component in a power supply is electrically undesirable. The second problem 
is simply that known designs of this type use very complex mechanical drive systems 
to ensure that the two sets of contacts move at the correct times, the use of complex 
mechanical drives is generally undesirable on grounds of cost, but is particularly 
undesirable in a circuit breaker which must remain in a current transmitting position for  
 
long periods of time, generally months to years, and reliably move to a current blocking 
position in fractions of a second on demand. Athough they are most pronounced in circuit breakers these problems are 
encountered in electrical switchgear generally, the larger the currents being switched 
the greater the problems become. This invention was intended to produce electrical switchgear at least partially 
overcoming these problems. This invention provides electrical switchgear comprising first and second main 
electrodes a third arcing electrode and a resilient contact element, the first and third 
electrodes being electrically connected together and attached to a first member and the

Electrical switchgear comprising first and second main electrodes a third arcing 
electrode and a resilient contact element, the first and third electrodes being 

electrically connected together and attached to a first member and the resilient 
element being connected to the second electrode and the second electrode 

being connected to a second member, the second member being able to move 
relative to the first member between a first ON position and through a second 

intermediate position to a third OFF position, where in the ON position the main 
electrodes are in contact and the resilient element and the arcing electrode are 

out of contact, in the intermediate position the main electrodes are out of contact 
and the resilient element is in contact with the arcing electrode and in the OFF 

position the main electrodes are out of contact and the arcing electrode is out of 
contact with the resilient element, and also being able to move between the third 

OFF position to the first ON position without the resilient element and the arcing 
electrode coming into contact. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in claim 1 where a plurality of resilient elements 
are secured to the second electrode. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in claim 2 where the resilient elements surround 
the second electrode. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in any preceding claim where the or each 
 

resilient element is a spring finger. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in any preceding claim in which the second 
member bears a pair of pins which move along a slot which is fixed relative to 

the first member, the slot having two walls with different profiles and the pins 
being constrained to follow one wall when moving from the ON to the OFF 

position and the other wall when moving from the OFF to the ON position such 
that the path followed by the second member relative to the first member is 

different when moving in each direction. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in claim 5 in which one wall of the slot is 
straight along its entire length and the other wall of the slot is straight along most 

of its length but bears a detent into which one of the pins is urged when the pin 
is moving along the slot in one direction only. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 in which cam and 
rachet means are provided, the cam and rachet means being arranged to act on 

the second member so that the path followed by the second member relative to 
the first member is different when moving from the ON to the OFF position from 

the path followed when moving from the OFF to the ON position. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in claim 7 in which the cam and rachet means 
comprises a rachet mechanism which causes a cam to act on the second 

member when moving in one direction only. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in claim 8 in which the cam acts on the second 
member only when moving from the ON to the OFF position. 
Electrical switchgear as claimed in any preceding claim where the electrical 
switchgear is a circuit breaker.
