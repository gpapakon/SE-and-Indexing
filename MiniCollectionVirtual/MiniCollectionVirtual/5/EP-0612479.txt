<ABSTRACT>
A process for the production of ready-to-eat pizzas 
provides for them to be treated after baking by 

microwaves and hot air at around 100°C. This treatment 
ensures that all ingredients of the pizzas are 

pasteurised and that superficial moisture is removed from 
each pizza.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
industrial production of chilled ready-to-eat pizzas, 
that is to say pizzas which are prepared, packaged and 
stored at a low temperature for the entire period 
required to market them (the so-called cold chain for the 
distribution, display and sale of products in general). In the following description and in the subsequent 
claims, the term "pizza" is intended to define a well 
known and widely consumed food product which includes 1) 
a base, generally a flattened disc, obtained by kneading 
a pre-leavened dough of flour and water which 
incorporates appropriate quantities of yeast and salt and 
2) a topping which in general, in more traditional 
preparations, usually includes tomato, oil, chopped 
cheese and oregano. It is known that the topping for a pizza may vary greatly 
according to different consumer tastes and according to 
the imagination of the maker. Therefore, other 
ingredients are often added to the basic topping, such as 
anchovies, tuna, seafoods, olives, artichokes, various 
chopped vegetables, appropriately sliced sausage 
products, mushrooms, pickles, cheeses, eggs.  
 The term "ready-to-eat pizza" is intended to refer to a 
pizza that, once removed from the container in which it 
had been packaged and stored, requires simply to be 
heated to be as tasty and appetising as when it was fresh 
out of the oven. For the industrial production of ready-to-eat pizzas as, 
in general, for the production of other items of ready-to-eat 
food products, it is necessary to comply with a 
dual requirement, that is, on the one hand, to ensure 
that the pizza is non-toxic and keeps well and, on the 
other hand, to keep the physical and organoleptic 
properties of the pizza as close as possible to those of 
freshly prepared pizza straight from the oven. In order to ensure that food products in general, and in 
particular cooked, ready-to-eat food products are non-toxic 
and keep well, prior art practices teach that the 
products should be sterilised or pasteurised by 
appropriate heat treatments which, in some happy cases, 
may coincide with the cooking processes themselves. WO-A-92-02 150 discloses a method and an apparatus for microwave 
assisted heating followed by vacuum cooling for food products, such as bread to provide rapid heat treatment of products. In the case of pizza, non-toxicity and keeping capacity 
must be ensured for all components (base and toppings) 
which, it is known, may each have very different natural 
characteristics and
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for the industrial production of chilled 
ready-to-eat pizzas including the continuous preparation 

of pizza bases from an adequately leavened dough of flour 
and water, incorporating yeast and salt, the arrangement 

on each base of a respective topping of several 
ingredients and the baking of the pizzas thus prepared in 

an oven at 350°-600°C for a period of 1-1.5 minutes, 
characterised in that it includes the following steps: 


pasteurising the baked pizzas in a continuous 
process, by subjecting them simultaneously microwaves and 

of flows of hot air at 90°-100°C, 
chilling the pasteurised pizzas to a temperature 
between 0°C and 8°C in a sterile environment and 
packaging the chilled pizzas while maintaining them 
at the above chilling temperature. 
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the pasteurisation step is followed by a step of 

treating the pasteurised pizzas with a flow of hot air at 
90°-100°C, without microwaves. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the steps of pasteurising the pizzas and treating 

them with hot air without microwaves are carried out in 
a single tunnel environment, the air being sterile and  

 
overpressured. 
A process according to Claim 2, characterised in 

that the pasteurisation step is carried out for a period 
of between 1 and 2.5 minutes, with the subsequent step of 

treatment with sterile hot air being carried out for 1-3 
minutes. 
A plant for carrying out the process of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that it includes, arranged in line: 


a pizza-baking oven (1), 
a pasteurising tunnel (3) traversed by a mesh conveyor 
belt (4) and provided with a suction-blower assembly 

(7) including air heating means (12) and having 
its suction end (6) opening into the tunnel and its delivery 

end (7a) in fluid communication, through respective ducts (8, 9), 
with the intake end (10) and the output end (11) respectively of 

the tunnel itself, the suction end of the suction-blower 
assembly defining two section within the tunnel, a first 

section, intended for the pasteurisation of the baked 
pizzas by microwaves and hot air, provided with a 

plurality of microwave sources (5), the second section 
intended for the treatment of the pasteurised pizzas with 

hot air alone, 
a sterile environment (16) provided with cooling (17) and 
packaging equipment (18) of known type, suitable for operation 

in sterile conditions.
