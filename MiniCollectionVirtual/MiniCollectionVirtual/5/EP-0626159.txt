<ABSTRACT>
Cover sheet for body fluid-absorbing articles, comprising a first layer (5) which is made of a thermoplastic layer and contains liquid channels (10) which each extend downward through the layer, and a second layer (6) which contains 70-100 per cent by weight of cellulose fibres and is connected to the first layer about the lower openings (12) in the respective liquid channels and merely contains mechanically interwoven fibres. The density of the second layer is higher than the density of fibres contained in the liquid-absorbing core.

Absorbing article for body fluid with a liquid-permeable
coversheet (2) which has a multiplicity of liquid channels (10)

extending respectively through the said coversheet (2) from one

upper opening (11) to a lower opening (12) and a skin contact
surface (13) which extends continuously around the upper openings

(11) of the liquid channels (10), with a liquid-permeable lower
layer (3) and a liquid-absorbing core (4) lying between these

layers, the coversheet comprising

a first layer (5) which is produced from a thermoplastic
plastic material and which is provided with liquid channels (10)

and the skin contact surface (13) and
a second layer (6) which lies under the first layer and is
connected with the latter around the lower openings of the

liquid channels respectively,
the second layer (6) being produced only from mechanically
interlaced fibres and having a higher density than the density

of the fibres contained in the liquid-absorbing core (4).
Absorbing article according to claim 1 in which the fibres
of the second layer (6) are orientated in the longitudinal

direction of the coversheet (2).
Absorbing article according to claim 1 or 2 in which the
second layer (6) comprises a mixture of 70 - 100% by weight of

cellulose fibres and 30 - 0 % by weight of thermoplastic synthetic
fibres.
Method for producing a coversheet (2), which can be used in
articles for absorbing body fluid, which has a multiplicity of

liquid channels (10) extending respectively through said
coversheet from an upper opening (11) to a lower opening (12) and

which has a skin contact surface (13) extending continuously
around the upper openings of the liquid channels, the article

having a liquid-permeable lower layer (13) and a liquid-absorbing 
core (4) lying between the coversheet and the lower layer, the

method comprising the steps:

inflation of molten fibres (80) from a liquid-blowing
extruder (52) into a form with a multiplicity of projections

which are dimensioned essentially uniform in height, the
projections having flat upper-sides in order to form a liquid-blown

bonded fabric corresponding to the configuration of the
form;
contact of the liquid-blown bonded fabric on the upper-sides
with a heating element (53) to form openings which are delimited

respectively by a recessed periphery region; and
supply of a fabric fleece (42), comprising only mechanically
interlaced fibres with a density which is greater than the

density of the fibres contained in the liquid-absorbing core,
onto the liquid-blown bonded fabric and consequently mechanical

interlacing of the fibre fleece around the recessed periphery
regions to maintain the coversheet.
Method according to claim 4 in which the fibres of the
fibre fleece (42) are orientated in a longitudinal direction.
Method according to claim 4 in which the fibre fleece
comprises a mixture of 70 - 100 % by weight of cellulose fibres

and 30 - 0 % by weight of thermoplastic synthetic fibres.
