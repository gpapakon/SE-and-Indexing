<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to liquid crystalline compounds and liquid crystal compositions. More particularly, it relates to
novel liquid crystalline compounds having a hexafluoropropyl group and liquid crystal compositions containing the
same.Liquid crystal compositions, particularly nematic liquid crystal compositions, have been broadly used for various
display materials such as displays for watches, electronic calculators, word processors, computer terminals or television,
etc. Liquid crystal display elements using nematic liquid crystal compositions have three kinds of main driving
modes of twisted nematic (hereinafter abbreviated to TN) mode, super-twisted nematic (hereinafter abbreviated to
STN) mode and thin-film transistor drive mode (hereinafter abbreviated to TFT). Among these, TFT mode has a superior
display capability; hence it has been used for televisions and large scale color display and broadening of its use
applications has been most expected.Liquid crystal compounds for TFT require the following characteristics of:
1) exhibiting nematic liquid crystal phase within a broad temperature range;2) having a large dielectric anisotropy value (herein-after abbreviated to ▵ε);3) having a large optical anisotropy value (hereinafter abbreviated to ▵n);4) having a low viscosity; and5) having a high voltage holding ratio (abbreviated hereinafter to VHR).Various compounds have been proposed for satisfying these characteristics. As compounds having a high VHR,
compounds containing fluorine atoms are superior, and research for liquid crystal compounds containing fluorine atoms
has been extensively carried out. For example, compounds having 3,4-difluorobenzene core at the terminal of the molecule
(DE 3042391), and compounds having 3,4,5-trifluorobenzene core aiming at a larger Δε (USP 5032313) have
been known, but they are unsuitable due to their very low clearing points. Further, compounds having introduced trifluoromethyl
group, trifluoromethoxy group or difluoromethoxy group at the terminal of the molecules (DE 4027840)
have been known, but they have drawbacks that the clearing point is still low and the An is still small. Further, in recent
years, a compound having 1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethoxy group at its terminal (DE 4142519) and a compound having 2,2,2-tri-fluoroethoxy
group at its terminal (WO 93/3113) have been reported, but they have drawbacks that their clearing
points are low and moreover have no sufficiently large Δε; hence they are insufficient in the aspects of characteristics.In order to
