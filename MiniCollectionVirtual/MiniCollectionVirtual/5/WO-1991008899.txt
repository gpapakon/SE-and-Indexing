A dielectric passivation layer (52) overlies the first circuit portion except at the discrete terminal regions of the first circuit portion branches (31a-31l). A second circuit portion comprising a plurality of multiplex electrode lines (37, 38, 39) overlies the passivation layer (52) and includes connection sections extending through the passivation layer into contact with terminal regions of the first circuit. A second passivation layer (60) overlies the second circuit portion, but not the resistive heater elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BUBBLE JET PRINT HEAD HAVING IMPROVED MULTIPLEX ACTUATION CONSTRUCTION Technical Field -The present invention relates to thermal, drop-on-demand, ink jet (herein termed "bubble jet") printing and, more particularly, to improved print head constructions for enabling high density printing. Background ArtTypically, in bubble jet print heads a plurality of electrically resistive heater elements are deposited on a support substrate that is formed e.g. of metal or silicon and has a heat control coating, e.g. Si02- Metal electrodes are formed to selectively apply voltage across the heater elements and a protective coating is provided over the heater elements and electrodes. Printing ink is supplied between the heater elements and orifices of the print head and heater elements are selectively energized to a temperature that converts the adjacent ink to steam rapidly, so that a shock wave causes ejection of ink from the related orifice.As the development and commercial use of the bubble jet technology progresses, there is increased interest in increasing the resolution of those systems. In this context, system resolution can be thought of as the number of pixel drops printed within a given print region (e.g. line length). One way to increase system resolution is to interlace ink drops, e.g. with multiple passes vis a vis a single array of orifices, or by providing a plurality of scanning orifice arrays. This approach simplifies the print head(s) construction, but requires accurate positioning of the print heads vis a vis the print media to assure good registration of the drops from separate passes. 

 Another way to increase system resolution is to increase the line density of drop ejector subsystems (i.e. orifices and related heater elements) on a single print head. This can be done with one or a plurality of linear orifice arrays (see e.g. U.S. Patent No. 4,734,717).. Photofabrication techniques enable construction of such high density orifice plate and heater subsystems; however, a present limit to increasing system resolution is presented by the difficulty in making electrical connections between a large number of heating resistors formed on a tiny chip and the electrical address electronics of the printer control system.To reduce the problem presented by the large number of addressing leads, several systems have been proposed for multiplexing the address of (i.e. the provision of energizing current through) the resistive heater elements of bubble jet print heads. For example, U.S. Patent 4,695,853
