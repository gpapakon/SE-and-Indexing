and 
(iii) said amine containing compound is dissolved 
in an organic solvent; 
(2) removing water from said condensation 
product;  
(3) adjusting the pH of the condensation 
reaction product to above 7 to form a basic reaction 

mixture; 
(4) filtering off neutralized catalyst to form a 
solvent reaction mixture; 
(5) heating said solvent reaction mixture under 
vacuum to a temperature ranging from about 110°C to 

250°C; 
(6) isolating from the heated solvent reaction 
mixture the reaction product derived solely from 

derived solely from said aldehyde and said amine and

<DESCRIPTION>
DE-B-1 123 103 teaches a process for stabilizing
high molecular linear polycondensates containing amide
groups using N,N'-di-substituted-p-phenylene-aldehyde reaction products.Amine containing antiozonants are commonly used in
diene rubbers to avoid degradation through ozonolysis and
oxidation. Common examples of such amine containing
compounds are antiozonants such as
N,N'-di-substituted-p-phenylene diamines. See M. Morton, "Rubber Technology, 3d Ed., Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York 1987, pp 48-53, 542. In the
business of manufacturing rubber products, such as tires,
there have been monumental gains in rubber chemistry
which have extended the product's useful life. This
extension has increased the demands placed on
antiozonants. Therefore, there is a continuing need for
superior antiozonants to further prolong the useful life
of these rubber products.The present invention relates to a composition
comprising a high molecular weight amine containing
antiozonant that is prepared in a multi-step process.There is disclosed a composition which exhibits
antiozonant activity in diene containing rubbers
comprising the reaction product obtainable by a multistep process
comprising:
(1) reacting under condensation conditions
reactants consisting of an aldehyde and an amine
containing compound to form a condensation product
wherein
said aldehyde is selected from the group
consisting of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde or mixtures
thereof; andsaid amine containing compound is selected from
the group consisting of: 
N,N'-di-substituted-p-phenylene diamines of the
structural formula:

wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from the
group of radicals consisting of alkyls having 3 to 12
carbon atoms, aryls having 6 to 12 carbon atoms and
aralkyls having 7 to 12 carbon atoms; and wherein said
condensation conditions include:
(i) the presence of an acid catalyst,(ii) a mole ratio of aldehyde to amine containing
compound ranging from 1.01:2 to 2:1, and(iii) said amine containing compound is dissolved in
an organic solvent;(2) removing the water from said condensation
product;(3) adjusting the pH of the condensation reaction
product to above 7 to form a basic reaction mixture;(4) filtering off neutralized catalyst to form a
solvent reaction mixture;(5) heating said solvent reaction mixture under
vacuum to a temperature ranging from 110°C to 250°C;(6) isolating from the solvent reaction mixture the
reaction product derived solely from said aldehyde and
said amine and wherein said reaction product exhibits
antiozonant
