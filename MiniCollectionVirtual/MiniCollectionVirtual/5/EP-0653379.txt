<ABSTRACT>
A material having a single or double bond between carbon atoms is mixed with hematite powder, and burned 
in an inert gas to produce magnetite powder. The magnetite powder is subjected to heat treatment in an oxygen 

atmosphere (or in the cooling process after burning in the inert gas). It is possible to impart a desired resistivity to 
the magnetite power while maintaining its characteristics.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing single phase magnetite powder suitable for 
use in a wide range of technical fields, e.g., those 
of toners and carriers for electrophotography, 
electric resistance elements and magnetic fluids. In the above process of the present invention, 
the single phase magnetite powder is produced by 
adding an organic substance, etc., to hematite powder 
and heating the mixture in an inert gas. The following three general methods are known for 
producing magnetite, and it is known that they have 
respective drawbacks as described below. 
(1) 
Wet process:an aqueous solution of Fe2+ + 2 Fe3+ 
is rendered alkaline and 
coprecipitated. Drawbacks:production cost is high and it is 
not suitable for mass production, 
although fine particles each having 
a relatively high purity are 
readily obtained by  
 
coprecipitation. (2) 
Dry process:hematite is heated in either 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide or 
steam to thereby be reduced. Drawbacks:the reaction is performed in a 
relatively highly reducing 
atmosphere, e.g., either high 
pressure steam or hydrogen and 
carbon monoxide, so that danger 
accompanies the mass production, 
and large scale equipment is 
required. (3) 
Process in which natural magnetite is pulverized. 
Drawbacks:a natural mineral is used as a 
starting material, so that it is 
difficult to stably produce high 
quality powder for a prolonged 
period of time. Taking into account the advantages and 
disadvantages of the above processes, various 
proposals have been made with respect to the 
production of magnetite powder for use in magnetic 
toners and carriers for electrophotography, etc. For example, Japanese Patent Publication Nos. 
238,580/1987, 39,498/1990 and 51,505/1990 disclose  
 
processes for producing magnetite useful as a carrier 
component of an electrophotographic developer, 
especially a two-component developer composed of a 
toner and a carrier. Each of these processes 
comprises providing magnetite powder (or globular 
magnetite particles) as a starting material, 
granulating the same into globular grains through, for 
example, mixing with a binder, followed by heating 
(sintering), and applying a resin coating to the 
resultant globular magnetite particles according to 
the conventional technique. The use of a material called soft ferrite as 
carrier particles is known (U.S. Patent No. 3,929,657, 
etc.). In this connection, it is known that the 
carrier particles each composed of the above ferrite 
not only are excellent in

<CLAIMS>
A process for producing single phase magnetite 
powder, comprising adding 0.1 to 4.0% by weight of a 

liquid or powdery substance having a carbon-to-carbon 
single or double bond to hematite powder, stirring the 

mixture to obtain a substantially homogeneous mixture, 
and heating the mixture in an inert gas at 1200 to 

1450°C. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein said 
liquid or powdery substance is an organic binder. 
The process according to claim 2, wherein, prior 
to said heating in the inert gas, said hematite powder 

having the organic binder added thereto is granulated 
into globular grains to thereby render the produced 

magnetite powder globular. 
The process according to claim 1, wherein, after 
said heating, cooling is performed at a temperature 

regulated to 300°C or below in an atmosphere having an 
oxygen concentration regulated to 0.1 to 21% by weight 

to thereby cause the magnetite powder to have a 
desired electric resistance.  

 
The process according to claim 1, wherein, after 
said heating in the inert gas, the resultant magnetite 

powder is subjected to a second heating in an 
atmosphere having an oxygen concentration of 0.1 to 

21% by weight at 250 to 300°C.
