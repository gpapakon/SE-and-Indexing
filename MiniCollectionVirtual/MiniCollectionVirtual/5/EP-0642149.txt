<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inline electron gun
for a color cathode ray tube, more particularly to an
inline electron gun which can provide high resolution by
dynamically controlling the electrostatic lenses that
control electron beams according to the intensity of
beam current.As shown in FIG. 1, a prior art electron gun
includes a cathode 1 for discharging an electron beam, a
control electrode 2 for controlling the discharge of
electrons, a first acceleration electrode 3 for
accelerating the electron beam toward a screen, and an
arrangement of many electrodes having at least two
focusing lenses 4 and a second acceleration electrode 5.
The control electrode 2 is generally grounded and the
first acceleration electrode 3 has a voltage of 300 to
1000V applied thereto to form an electron beam forming
region. The focusing electrodes 4 and the second
acceleration electrode 5, have a focusing voltage (Vf ;
5000 to 9000 V) and an accelerating voltage (Vg ; 20000
to 32000V) applied thereto to form a main electrostatic
lens 9.The electron beam emitted from the cathode 1 starts
to diverge at a crossover 7 near the first acceleration
electrode 3.The diverging electron beam is focused primarily by
the electrostatic lens formed of a potential difference
between the first acceleration electrode 3 and the
focusing electrode 4, i.e., by the prefocusing lens 8,
and forms a small pixel on the screen 6 by virtue of the
main electrostatic lens 9. In the foregoing prior art electron gun, electrons
are controlled by a cathode voltage Vc which has an
amplitude which varies as a function of time and is
discharged through the cathode 1 as heat, while the
intensity of current is determined by the configuration
of the electron beam forming regions and the voltages
applied to the cathode and various electrodes.
Accordingly, the electrons form a crossover 7 and start
to diverge therefrom. The diverging electrons are
focused primarily by the prefocusing lens formed of the
potential difference between the first acceleration
electrode 3 and the focusing electrode 4 and, again by
the main electrostatic lens 9 to form a small beam spot
on the screen.The beam, i.e., spot, size has a very close
relationship to the resolution of a CRT, and in general
as the resolution is improved the smaller the spot size
becomes. Major factors affecting the spot size are the
arrangement of the main lens, spherical astigmation, and
a space charge exerting force on the electrons in the
free space between the electron gun and the screen.
These factors have
