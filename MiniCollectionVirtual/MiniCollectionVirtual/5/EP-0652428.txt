<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a particle analyzer, and more
particularly to a particle analyzer for analyzing morphology of
particles such as a fine ceramic powder, pigment powder or
cosmetic powder.It is extremely important to measure and analyze the size of
particles for controlling the quality of a powder such as a fine
ceramic powder, pigment powder, cosmetic powder or the like. A
conventionally available measuring device uses a liquid
sedimentation method or an electrozone method (Coulter principle)
whereas a currently known measuring device uses a laser
diffraction method.However, none of measuring devices using the aforementioned
methods are satisfactory in terms of precision (accuracy) in
measurement and measuring range thereof. In particular, when a
particle to be measured has a flat or elongated shape, the particle
diameter to be measured will be largely different depending on the
measuring method. Besides, even when the same measuring method
is adopted, measured values are largely different and peculiar
particle size distribution curves are given depending on the type of
the measuring device.Since larger particles sediment faster than smaller particles
in a suspension, the concentration of particles varies with the lapse
of time and in three demensions. A method for determining a 
particle size distribution by detecting the particle concentration
based on an amount of light transmitted though the suspension is a
liquid sedimentation light transmitting method, which is typical as
the liquid sedimentation method. A device using this method has the
following drawbacks:
(i) when the particle has a diameter on the submicron order or
less, the measured particle size must be corrected by a light
absorption constant corresponding to the refractive index and particle
diameter thereof,(ii) the brownian motion and convection of the particles affect
the measurement of the particle size(iii) it takes a considerable time to measure the particle size,
and(iv) reproducibility of the measured data and integrity between
different types of devices are not so favorable.A device using the electrozone method detects a variation in
electric resistance that appears when particles floating in an
electrolyte pass through an orifice. The device has the advantage
that the volume-equivalent diameter of the particle can be measured
with virtually no influence from the shape thereof. However, the
device using the method has also the following drawbacks:
1) The range in which the diameter of particles can be
measured
