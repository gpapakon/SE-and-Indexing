<ABSTRACT>
The plastic housing of the unit consists of a lower part (1) and of a cover (2). One upper printed circuit board (16) and one or more lower printed circuit boards (28, 30) are fitted in the lower part. Additional modules (21, 22) can be connected to the upper printed circuit board by means of plugs. The lower printed circuit boards (28, 30) are pushed in on supporting ribs (26) and between guide ribs (25) under the upper printed circuit board (16) and, once they have been pushed in, are connected to a bus printed circuit board (14) by means of a plug connection (31, 32) such that they can be replaced. A screening plate (35) is mounted on the base (3) of the housing lower part (1). The housing of the unit can be configured in a simple and cost-effective manner while nevertheless ensuring adequate screening, as a result of the plate (35). The two-level or three-level design allows the unit to be constructed in a compact manner while all the printed circuit boards are nevertheless accessible since the lower printed circuit boards (28, 30) can easily be removed without removing the upper printed circuit board (16). The construction of the unit and of the printed circuit boards allows the unit to be fitted in various ways, allows the printed circuit boards to be replaced easily, and thus allows versatile design options.

Programmable control unit, comprising a housing of 
synthetic material having a lower part (1) and a cover (2) 

removably fastened to the lower part (1), and
 
a plurality of printed boards (14, 16, 28, 29, 30) being 

accessibly disposed within the lower part (1) in at least 
two planes lying one above the other,
 
characterised by the fact that 


an upper printed board (16) is fixedly disposed in an upper 
plane as a main print carrying a central unit (CPU), 
that a bus printed board (14) carrying two rows of male 
connectors (32) is fixedly disposed in a lower plane, 
that exchangeable printed boards (28, 29, 30) arranged as 
peripheral modules are provided carrying female connectors 

(31) coordinated to the male connectors (32), said printed 
boards being arranged for insertion between the upper 

printed board (16) and the bottom (3) of the lower housing 
part (1) and for connection with the bus printed board (14) 

in such a manner that these exchangeable printed boards 
(28, 29, 30) are all situated in the lower plane, and 
that guide means (25, 26, 27) lengthways of which the exchangeable 
printed boards (18, 29, 30) are displaceable and 

pluggable by their female connectors (31) in the direction 
of displacement, are provided at the bottom (3) of the 

lower housing part (1). 
Unit according to claim 1,
 
characterised by the fact that the exchangeable printed 

boards (28, 29, 30) are of different size.  
 
Unit according to claim 1,
 
characterised by the fact that a shielding plate (35) is 

disposed at the housing bottom (3) which closely fits 
through resilient fingers (35a) to contacts of the exchangeable 

printed boards (28, 29, 30). 
Unit according to claim 1,
 
characterised by the fact that the lower housing part (1) 

has walls (9, 10, 12) at opposing sides which form lateral 
cable ducts (13). 
Unit according to claim 4,
 
characterised by the fact that two of said walls (9, 10) 

serve simultaneously for the mounting of the upper printed 
board (16). 
Unit according to claim 1,
 
characterised by the fact that additional peripheral modules 

(21, 22), for example a display module, are provided 
which are pluggable onto the upper printed board (16). 
Unit according to claim 1,
 
characterised by the fact that light conductors (38) are 

disposed in the housing cover (2) being in contact with 
light sources (39) provided on the printed boards (16, 28, 

29, 30). 
Unit according to claim 7,
 
characterised in that the light sources are light emitting 

diodes (39).
