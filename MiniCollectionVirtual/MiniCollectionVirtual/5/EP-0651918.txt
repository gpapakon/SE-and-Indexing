<ABSTRACT>
In an elastically deformable insulating and sealing body (1) for cable plugs and the like with a central channel (2) to take a cable of a power supply system, especially a medium or high-voltage system, and with an electrode consisting of a conductive layer (15) applied to the surface of the insulating and sealing body (1) for capacitive measurement of the voltage conducted by the cable, one sleeve-like end section (13) of the insulating and sealing body (1) is fitted over the adjoining section (8) which is also sleeve-like. A connecting line (17, 18) is clamped in a stress-relieving manner between the two sections (8, 13) and pressed by the clamping force on a region of the conductive layer (15) to form a contact.

Resiliently deformable insulation and sealing body for 
cable connectors and the like, with a central through 

duct for housing a cable of an energy-supply system, 
particularly a medium-voltage or high-voltage energy-supply 

system, and with an electrically-conducting layer 
applied to the surface of the insulation and sealing 

body, characterized in that a bush-like end portion (13; 
113, 113') of the insulation and sealing body (1; 101) 

can be turned up over the portion (8; 108) adjoining it, 
which is also formed like a bush. 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the portion (13; 113) which is 

turned over fits on the other bush-like portion (8; 108) 
with radial pressure. 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 1 or 
Claim 2, characterized in that the two bush-like portions 

(8, 13; 108, 113, 113') are connected to one another by 
a connection region (9; 109) with reduced wall thickness. 
Insulation and sealing body according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that one bush-like 

portion (13; 108) has a projecting toroidal material 
portion (14; 114) which is housed completely by an 

annular-groove-like recess (7; 107) of the other bush-shaped 
portion (8; 113) when the two bush-like portions 

(8, 13; 108, 113) are turned over one another. 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the toroidal material portion (114)  

 
has a sawtooth-like cross-sectional profile. 
Insulation and sealing body according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that an end portion of a 

lead (18) which is preferably relieved of strain, and/or 
an electrically-conducting contact body (17) connected to 

this end portion, is pinched between the two portions (8, 
13; 108, 113) of the insulation and sealing body (1; 101) 

turned over one another, forming an electrical contact 
with the conducting layer (15; 115). 
Insulation and sealing body according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that it is provided with 

a through hole (11; 111) for a lead (18). 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that, when the end portion (13; 113) is 

not turned over, the through hole (11; 111) extends 
through the insulation and sealing body (1; 101) in a 

radial direction and is extended by an inwardly-projecting 
hollow stud (12). 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 8, 
characterized in that the through hole (11; 111) is 

provided in the connection region (9; 109). 
Insulation and sealing body according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the bush-like end 

portion (8; 108) over which the other end portion (13; 
113) is turned, has an end region which adjoins an 

external cone (5; 105) and the external lateral surface 
of which has the shape of a funnel opening towards the 

external cone (5; 105).  
 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that the turned-over portion (113) is 

widened like a funnel towards its free end and, with this 
end region, overlaps the funnel-shaped end region of the 

inner portion (108) at least on a portion of the axial 
length thereof. 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that the funnel-shaped end region (13') 

of the turned-over portion (113) projects beyond the end 
of the bush-like portion (108) adjoining the external 

cone (105). 
Insulation and sealing body according to any one of 
Claims 10 to 12, characterized in that the conducting 

layer (15; 115) of the portion (8; 108) which is at least 
incompletely overlapped by the turned-over portion (13, 

113) extends into the funnel-shaped end region. 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 13, 
characterized in that the conducting layer (115) ends at 

a distance from the external cone (105) and the turned-over 
portion (113) fits closely with radial tension on 

the end region (108') disposed between this end and the 
external cone (105) and is free of the conducting layer 

(115) at least in the end region fitting on this end 
region (108'). 
Insulation and sealing body according to any one of 
Claims 10 to 14, characterized in that the turned-over 

portion (13; 113) is provided with the conducting layer 
(15; 115) at least in the funnel-shaped region of its 

lateral surface.  
 
Insulation and sealing body according to Claim 15, 
characterized in that the conducting layer (15; 115) also 

covers the remaining lateral surface which is on the 
inside of the turned-over end portion (13; 113) in the 

turned-over condition. 
Insulation and sealing body according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 16, characterized by an additional conducting 

layer (16) on the inside of the portion (8) covered by
