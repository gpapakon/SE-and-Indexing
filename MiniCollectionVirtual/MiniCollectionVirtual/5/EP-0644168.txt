<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a monoalkenyl benzene 
involves reacting an alkyl benzene having carbon atoms of not 

more than 10 with a conjugated diene compound having carbon 
atoms of 4 to 6 in the presence of a catalyst containing a 

carrier represented by the formula of K₂O·xAl₂O₃ where x is 0.5 
≦ x ≦ 11, and a catalyst component selected from sodium, 

sodium amide and mixtures thereof carried on said carrier.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing
monoalkenyl benzene. More particularly, it relates to a
method for producing monoalkenyl benzene employed as a
precursor for pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals or high
molecular materials.There has hitherto been known a method for producing
monoalkenyl benzene by reacting alkyl benzene with a
conjugated diene, such as 1,3-butadiene, in the presence of an
alkali metal catalyst (German Patent 557514). However, this
known method has a yield of 30% at most and hence is
inconvenient for practicing industrially.There has also been proposed a method in which, for
improving the above method, an oxide of an alkali metal or an
alkaline earth metal, such as calcium oxide, is employed as a
catalyst (Us Pat. No. 3244758). However, the catalyst has a
prolonged induction period and a lot of time is required until
the maximum activity is achieved, that is until a steady state
of the reaction is reached, thus raising problems in
connection with economic profitability and operational safety.
In addition, since with these methods not only monoalkenyl
benzene, but also compounds in which conjugated diene is
further added to monoalkenyl benzene or higher molecular
compounds are produced simultaneously, these polymers covering 
the catalyst surface gradually deactivate the catalyst.
Besides, such catalyst tends to be lowered not only in
activity but also in selectivity. As resinous polymers
made by such catalyst tend to encompass the catalyst per se
to solidify same, the catalyst is not completely deactivated
and still contains active parts so that when the used
catalyst is extracted for exchange, it is likely to be
ignited due to contact with oxygen and moisture in the
atmosphere to cause fire, thus raising difficulties in
handling.JP-A-05097722 describes methods for producing
alkenylbenzenes by treating alkyl benzenes with 1,3-butadiene
substantially in the absence of oxygen and water,
and in the presence of catalysts prepared by dispersing
sodium on inorganic compositions containing calcined and
dehydrated KOH. The catalyst is prepared by calcining KOH
at 450°C for 3 hours, supported on alumina, followed by
drying at 400 to 450°C for 5 hours, dispersion in o-xylene,
and mixing with a dispersion of sodium in o-xylene at 140°C
for 1 hour.JP-A-05112476 describes methods for the preparation of
alkenylbenzenes derivatives by treating alkyl benzenes with
conjugated diolefins in the absence of oxygen and water,
using catalysts prepared by dispersing alkyl metals on a
potassium
