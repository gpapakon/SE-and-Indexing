<ABSTRACT>
A fast-discharge switch (M1) is controlled by a comparator (M2) 
sensing the voltage difference between the output node and the input 

node of a driving integrator stage that controls the slew-rate of a 
power switching output transistor (MP). The fast-discharge switch turns 

off automatically when the output power transistor reaches (in the case 
of a MOS transistor) or exits (in the case of a bipolar transistor) 

saturation. The circuit of the invention accelerates the discharge thus 
reducing the turn-off delay and is insensitive  of load conditions and 

does not affect the performance of the integrating (driver) stage that 
control the slew-rate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns slew-rate control of output 
power transistors in general, and the reduction of 
turn-off delay in particular. In inductive load drive systems, as those of a DC 
brushless motor, for example, it is necessary to limit 
induced disturbances both in terms of electromagnetic 
emissions and of noise on supply lines. Usually, 
specific circuits for controlling output power transistor 
slew-rates are used for this purpose. Slew-rate control is usually implemented by the use 
of an integrating stage to prevent discontinuities in 
the load current characteristic so as to drive the 
output power transistor, as shown in Fig. 1. A driving signal is fed to an input node A of the 
integrating stage, which consists of a buffer B1, a 
feedback capacitor C and a discharge generator I(slew). The use of such an integrating circuit provides several 
drawbacks. It should be noted in particular that, 
when the ratio I(slew)/C (V/µsec) is small, the time 
taken by output power transistor MP to exit the linear 
zone and enter the saturation zone of its 
characteristic, during turn-off may be too long and 
consequently cause a switching delay that, under 
certain circumstances, may not be tolerated by the 
system as a whole. In order to avoid such a drawback, recourse is 
commonly made to circuits that permit one to "accelerate" 
the slew-rate during an initial phase of a turn-off 
process, before allowing the discharge to continue with 
an adequately greater time constant so as determined by 
the integrating stage, in order to curb disturbances.  
 These known accelerating circuits are of the same 
type as that outlined in Fig. 2. A logic control signal IN is applied to the control 
terminal of a discharging current generator M1. At the 
instant t1, when the turn-off of the output power 
transistor MP is started, the transistor M1 (which may 
or may not be under current control) is switched-on. 
This makes the gate of the output power transistor MP 
to quickly discharge until the input node A of the 
integrating stage reaches the threshold set by the 
diode D1 (which may also be replaced by several diodes 
in series, by a MOS diode, or by another threshold 
device, as needed). At this point, the contribution to 
the discharge current provided by the transistor (generator) 
M1 ceases, and the turn-off process of the MP 
output power transistor thus continues with a time 
constant as set by the values I(slew) and C of the 
slew-rate control, integrating stage. One of the 
drawbacks of these known
