<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to prevent an ink jet inactivation state which is induced when ink droplets adhering to the jet port 
surface of an ink jet head reach the jet port, and is characterized by including a water repellent region in the proximity of the jet 

port disposed on the jet port surface and a groove-like hydrophilic region inside a region spaced apart by a predetermined distance 
from the jet port and adjacent to the water repelling region. Since the groove-like hydrophilic region is disposed, the ink 

droplets adhering to the jet port surface can be taken into the hydrophilic region. Accordingly, excellent recording can be accomplished 
even under the condition of high speed recording and high frequency driving.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink jet head
according to the preamble of claim 1.
The present invention also relates to an ink
jet apparatus according to the preambles of claims 3 or 9.As for recording systems, a number of proposals have
already been made. Among the proposed recording systems,
ink jet recording systems have been spotlighted and widely
used since they are non-impact recording systems and low in 
noise and in addition to these advantages, they are capable
of performing high speed recording.There are known a number of ink jet apparatus
suitable for practicing such ink jet recording system.
Among those ink jet apparatus, the ink jet apparatus based
on the system of conducting ink discharging by way of
producing film boiling by virtue of thermal energy are
presently evaluated as being practically advantageous
because the direction of ink to be discharged can be
maintained in a stable state as desired. However, as for
such ink jet apparatus, there are still some problems
required to solve such that following ink droplets
discharged from the discharging outlets in response to a
recording signal applied, minute ink particles are often
generated through the discharging outlets and other than
this, very minute ink particles are often rebounded upon
arrival of ink droplets discharged from the discharging
outlets at a recording sheet, wherein these minute ink
particles (which will be occasionally referred to as ink
mist in the following) are eventually deposited to form
pools each comprising an aggregate of minute ink particles
on the discharging outlet face of the ink jet head of the
ink jet apparatus and they remain in the vicinity of the
discharging outlets arranged at the discharging outlet face
to interrupt successive ink discharging from the 
discharging outlets or to often make some of the
discharging outlets unable to perform ink discharging.JP-A-4-211959
proposes a technique of eliminating the problems above
described in that the discharging outlet face of an ink jet
head at which a plurality of discharging outlets are
arranged is applied with a water repellent material.FIG. 1 is a schematic illustrating the constitution
of an ink jet head described in the above patent literature
which has a discharging outlet face applied with a water
repellent material to the surface thereof. In FIG. 1,
reference numeral 101 indicates a water repellent film,
reference numeral 102 an ink supply port, reference numeral
103 a grooved top plate including portions of integrally
forming nozzles, liquid
