<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for preparing (S)(+)-4,4'-(1-methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)-bis(2,6-piperazinedione)
(hereinafter referred to as "ICRF-187"). In particular,
the invention is concerned with a practical process,
utilizable on a commercial scale for the preparation of
ICRF-187, in which process certain operations hitherto
regarded as necessary are avoided, but which process still
produces ICRF-187 of the same or better quality in very
acceptable commercial yield.ICRF-187 was described by Creighton in, inter alia, US
Patents Nos 3,941,790 and 4,275,063 as a material useful
for aiding regression and palliation of cancer in mammals.
In Pathologie Biologie, 1987, 35 (No 1) 49-53, Green
described how certain anthracyclines are effective antitumour
agents but carry the side effect of a tendency to
produce cardiotoxicity upon chronic administration, but
also disclosed for the first time that ICRF-187 could
protect against such cardiotoxicity. One particular widely
used anti-cancer drug suffering from the disadvantage of
associated cardiotoxicity is doxorubicin hydrochloride. In
US Patent 4,963,551, Palepu et al described a method of
formulating ICRF-187 in a manner which can facilitate
intravenous administration of this substance as a 
cardioprotective agent to reduce or prevent cardiotoxicity
resulting from the administration of doxorubicin
hydrochloride.As for the manufacture of ICRF-187, Creighton, supra,
essentially described two methods. In the first method,
1,2-diaminopropane tetraacetic acid is heated with
formamide to result in incorporation of nitrogen and ring
closure. In the second method, the tetraamide
corresponding to the above tetraacid is heated in
polyphosphoric acid or phenol, bringing about cyclization.US Patent 4,764,614 describes an alternative synthesis in
which propylenediamine tetraacetic acid tetraamide is
treated in a dipolar aprotic solvent with an alkali metal
derivative of dimethyl sulfoxide to form a dialkali metal
salt of the desired bis-piperazinedione, the desired
heterocyclic product.EP-A-0 330 381 describes yet an alternative process for
preparing, inter alia, ICRF-187, in which a corresponding
tetranitrile is synthesized by reacting an appropriate
diamine with formaldehyde and an alkali metal cyanide. The
tetranitrile is then hydrated to yield an acid addition
salt of the corresponding tetraamide, and this latter
substance may then be cyclized. These various processes for making ICRF-187 suffer from a
number of disadvantages. Thus, the process of US Patent No

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of (S) (+)-4,4'-(1-methyl-1,2-ethanediyl)-bis-(2,6-piperazinedione)
(ICRF-187)

in which an intermediate 1,2-diaminopropane tetraacetic
acid product, is synthesized together with byproduct salt,

characterized in that the tetraacetic acid intermediate
product is subjected to ring formation in the form of a

crude product having substantial amounts of salt thereby to
produce the desired ICRF-187, wherein said intermediate

product is prepared for ring formation by precipitation
in a solvent system and said ring formation is effected

by said intermediate product being mixed with excess
formamide and heated to produce ICRF-187; wherein said

solvent system contains about 10% to about 50% water and
allows formation therein of a crystalline precipitate of

said intermediate product.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
tetraacetic acid product intermediate product is

predominantly the free acid, the disodium salt, or a
mixture thereof, and/or has been prepared by reacting

(S)-1,2-diaminopropane with sodium chloroacetic or with
chloroacetic acid in the presence of sodium hydroxide.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein
said (S)-1,2-diaminopropane has been produced as a bis-strong

acid, e.g. bis-hydrochloride, salt by treating
racemic 1,2-diaminopropane with D-tartaric acid to give

the diastereoisomeric bis-tartrate salt of (S)-1,2-diaminopropane
followed by treating said tartrate with

strong acid, e.g. hydrogen chloride. 
A process as claimed in any one claims 1 to 3,
wherein after reaction of (S)-1,2-diaminopropane with

sodium chloracetate or with chloroacetic acid in the
presence of sodium hydroxide the reaction mixture is

adjusted to a pH of about 6 or less, optionally pH 5.3.
A process as claimed in claim 4, wherein the
reaction mixture pH adjustment is to about pH 3 or below.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
said solvent system is methanol/water or

dimethylformamide/water.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
said solvent system is created by pouring an aqueous

mixture containing said intermediate product and salt
into methanol thereby to create a resulting mixture in

which water is present in an amount of about 10% to about
25% (v/v) of the amount of methanol so as to precipitate

a mixture of said intermediate product and alkali metal
salt.
A process as claimed in claim 7, wherein said water
amount is about 15 % to 22 % (v/v), optiionally about 20%

(v/v), of the amount of methanol.
A process as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein
after said heating formamide is removed so as to leave

from about 100 ml to about 200 ml of residual formamide
per 100 g of said intermediate product present pre-ring

formation. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9,
wherein ICRF-187 resulting from said ring formation is

separated from the bulk of said salt by either:

(a) partition between water and a partially immiscible
solvent in which ICRF-187 is soluble but not said salt,

optionally wherein said solvent comprises a water soluble
alcohol, dioxane, or tetrahydrofuran; or
(b) fractional crystallization with a solvent system
comprising formamide and a lower alcohol.
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10,
wherein said removal from ICR-187 resulting from said

ring formation is completed by filtration of the ICRF-187
solution obtained during a crystallization from dioxane.
