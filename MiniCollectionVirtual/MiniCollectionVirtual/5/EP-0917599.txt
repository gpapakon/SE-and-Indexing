<DESCRIPTION>
 FLASH-SPUN POLYMERField of the Invention This invention relates to flash spinning polymer and particularly to the products made from flash spinning polymer such as fibrous webs and consolidated sheets and fabrics.Background of the Invention Flash-spun fibers were originally created by Herbert Blades and James White, employees of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (DuPont), and disclosed in US Patent 3,081,510 on 19 March 1962. A variety of polymeric materials were disclosed in the patent primarily including linear polyethylene with some examples of polypropylene. Further examples of polymeric materials which may be spun into plexifilaments were described in a subsequent patent, US Patent 3,227,784 on 4 January 1966, also to Blades et al. These included polyethylene teraphthalate, polytetramethylbutadiene, polyhexamethylene adipamide, polyformaldehyde resin, and perfluoroethylene/perfluoropropylene copolymer in addition to further examples of linear polyethylene and polypropylene. Based upon the developments of Blades and White, and subsequent work of others, DuPont has scaled up to commercial production of flash-spun products under the trademark Tyvek® spunbonded olefin. Tyvek® spunbonded olefin has many uses for which its properties have been adapted and engineered such as air infiltration barriers, banners, envelopes, medical packaging, and protective apparel. DuPont has developed two basic styles of flash-spun nonwoven sheet products: area bonded material and point bonded material. Area bonded material is thermally bonded generally uniformly across the area of the sheet. Point or pattern bonded material is thermally bonded at points or in a pattern where the pattern creates portions which are more strongly bonded and not as strongly bonded. As such, area bonded products are typically stiffer than point bonded and have a paper-like feel. Point bonded flash-spun nonwoven 

products tend to have softer fabric-like feel. Point bonded flash-spun material is most commonly used in protective apparel. Area bonded products are used in envelopes, medical packaging and air infiltration barriers in construction applications. In several end uses, the tensile and elongation properties of the flash-spun nonwoven fabrics are of considerable importance such as in packaging and protective apparel. For example, the material for protective apparel is preferably quite strong; however, if it were to fail, then it is desired that it fail by stretching and deforming rather than ripping or breaking. It is particularly
