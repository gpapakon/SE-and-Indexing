<ABSTRACT>
The resistance of a resistive memory element, e.g. a synaptic element is programmed, e.g. adjusted to a target value, by pulses of a constant height and variable width. One polarity gives an increase in resistance; the other polarity gives a decrease. A short pulse applied after a longer pulse appears to have no effect. After each polarity change short pulses can again be used to make small adjustments. In a preferred embodiment longer and longer pulses are used until the resistance overshoots the target value. After overshooting the polarity is reversed and a second series of pulses is used to obtain a closer approach to the target. The resistive element comprises a resistive layer located between two electrodes, e.g. a matrix of amorphous silicon doped with boron containing V. One electrode is Cr and the other is V.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to resistive memory elements suitable
for use as synaptic elements in neural networks.Resistive memory elements usually take the form of a resistive
layer which is located between two electrodes, e.g. metallic
electrodes, which give access to the element. The resistive
layer is usually formed of a host material, e.g. amorphous
silicon, which contains a dopant to improve its host
properties. In addition, the memory element includes an
active species which plays a substantial part in the
conduction of an electric current and adjusts the resistance
of the resistive layer. The active species is usually a
metal dispersed in the host as small particles or as atoms.(Synaptic elements are usually configured as arrays in which
many elements, e.g. 103 - 108, are supported on a single
substrate. The substrate provides mechanical support for all
of the elements, but the substrate has little or no effect
upon the performance of the elements.)Each element may have its own separate electrodes, so that
arrays can be connected into networks as desired. It is also
possible that any one element may share one or both of its
electrodes with other elements. This means that the elements
are permanently connected into particular network patterns.
Arrays of elements are conveniently manufactured by depositing
the various layers on a suitable substrate. The layers may be
patterned by using well established techniques such as masking
and etching.It has been mentioned above that the resistive layer is
usually formed of a host material which includes an active
species. The elements V, Co, Ni, Pd, Fe and Mn are
particularly suitable as the active species for use with 
amorphous silicon as the host material. The active species is
conveniently introduced into a memory element by making one
electrode out cf the active species and causing it to migrate
into the host. The process of migration is "forming" and it
comprises applying a high voltage, e.g. of the order 8 - 35
volts, for a short time, e.g. 200 - 1,000 ns. The forming
process reduces the resistance of the element from a very high
value (in practice an infinite value) to a value which is
suitable for use in a neural network, e.g. to a value within
the range 103 - 106 Î©.It is emphasised that forming introduces the active species
into the host material to give an initial value to the
resistance. After forming, the resistance can be adjusted to
a target value, and it is possible for the resistance to be
adjusted and readjusted many times during the life of

A method of adjusting the resistance of a resistive memory element
to a target value wherein said resistive memory element comprises a

resistive layer (11) located between two metallic electrodes (12, 13, 14 and 16, 17,
18) and said resistive layer (11) is formed of a host material (11) which contains an

active species which plays a substantial part in the conduction of an electric current
and adjusts the resistance of the resistive layer (11); characterised in that the

method comprises:

(a) establishing a correlation between the duration of a voltage pulse applied
either to similar elements or to the same element and the resistance of the element

after a pulse of said duration has been applied,
(b) utilising said correlation to determine the duration of the programming
pulse appropriate for producing the target value, and
(c) applying a programming pulse of the duration specified by said
correlation to produce said target value.
A method of adjusting the resistance of a resistive memory element
to a target value wherein said resistive memory element comprises a resistive

layer (11) located between two metallic electrodes (12, 13, 14 and 16, 17, 18) and
said resistive layer (11) is formed of a host material (11) which contains an active

species which plays a substantial part in the conduction of an electric current and
adjusts the resistance of the resistive layer; characterised in that said method

comprises selecting a polarity adapted to cause the resistance to move to ards the
desired target value and applying a plurality of pulses having the same said polarity and

substantially the same voltage but differing durations wherein said voltage is within
the programming range wherein a later pulse has a greater duration than an earlier

pulse, whereby the resistance of the element is caused to move towards said target
value and wherein the application of said pulses is terminated when the resistance of

the element becomes equal to or overshoots the target value. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein the plurality of pulses constitutes a
sequence in which the duration of each pulse is greater the duration of its immediate

predecessor.
A method according to either of claims 2 or 3, which comprises a first
treatment at a first polarity followed by a second treatment at the reverse polarity;

said second treatment utilising smaller increments of duration whereby the resistance
is moved more slowly in the second treatment than in the first treatment so that a

better approximation to the target value is achieved in the second treatment than in
the first treatment.
A method according to any one of the proceedings claims, wherein the
active species is a metal dispersed in the host material (11) either as small particles

or atoms.
A method according to Claim 5, wherein the active species is formed of the
same metal as one electrode (13, 17).
A method according to Claim 6, wherein the host material (11) is amorphous
silicon or doped amorphous silicon and one electrode (17) and the active species are

selected from V, Co, Ni, Pd, Fe and Mn.
