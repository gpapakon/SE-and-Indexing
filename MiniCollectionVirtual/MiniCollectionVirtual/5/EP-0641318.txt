<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for Preparation of Aromatic ThiolsThis invention relates to a process of preparation of aromatic thiols wherein an aromatic halide is contacted with thiourea in the presence of nickel.Traditional synthetic routes to aromatic thiols from aromatic halides have involved nucleophilic displacement of halogen by alkyl thiolate anions reductive cleavage of the resulting aromatic thioether with sodium metal, followed by acidification to generate the desired thiol from its sodium salt. Thus, Adams and Ferriti (J. Am. Che . Soc, 81, 4939,1959) disclosed a process for the preparation of aromatic dithiols and trithiols by cleavage of the corresponding ethyl thioethers with sodium metal in liquid ammonia solvent. More recently, Tiecco et al (Synthesis., 10, 749, 1988.) have disclosed the preparation of numerous aromatic thiols by cleavage of the corresponding isopropyl thioethers using sodium metal in dipolar aprotic solvents. While these processes produce good yields of the desired thiols, they involve multiple synthetic steps and would be unsuitable for large scale production of these compounds.Recently, Takagi (Chem. Lett., 9, 1985, 1307) disclosed a process to prepare aromatic thiols which involves nucleophilic displacement of halogen by 

thiourea to yield the corresponding isothiuronium salt. The nucleophilic displacement of halogen by thiourea is catalyzed by a soluble nickel phosphine complex which is generated by in situ reduction of bis(triethylphosphine)nickel dichloride using sodium cyanoborohydride as the reducing agent. The desired thiol is generated by base hydrolysis of the isothiuronium salt to form the corresponding thiolate salt from which the desired thiol is generated by acidification. Although this method produces quantitative yields, there are several disadvantages to this procedure. First, a high mole ratio of catalyst to iodoaro atic (.04:1.0) is required. Second, the active catalyst must be generated in situ requiring the use of an expensive and toxic reducing agent-. Third, the catalyst cannot be recovered or regenerated from the reaction mixture. Fourth, because the reaction is catalyzed homogeneously, catalyst/product separation is difficult. Fifth, the product of the reaction is an isothiuronium salt which requires two subsequent workup steps in order to generate the desired dithiol.Tagaki reported (Chem. Lett., 9, 1985, 1307) that deposition of nickel metal' resulted in incomplete conversion of aromatic halides to the corresponding thiols. Rieke et al (J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 99,
