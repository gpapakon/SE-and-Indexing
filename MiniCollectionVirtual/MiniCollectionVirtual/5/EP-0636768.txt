<ABSTRACT>
An automatic variator for use in an internal combustion 
engine and other engines which use valve-type distribution 

systems, to operate a twin set of double-effect distribution 
sequential valve shafts for the purpose of regulating the 

valve overlap or timing and the valve opening section or to 
operate a double overhead camshaft with poppet valves for 

the purpose of regulating valve overlap or timing while the 
engine is running. A motor reducer advances (42) a spindle (44) 

against the valve shaft with a grooved screw (41) at one end of 
the same, causing the shaft to turn and move, thereby 

varying the valve overlap or the valve section and valve 
overlap.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic variator assembly for varying the
valve timing in a valvular distribution system in an internal combustion engine
which includes an engine block, a cylinder formed in the engine block, the
cylinder having a cylinder head, a piston slidable within the cylinder, and a
combustion chamber bounded by the cylinder and the piston, and a distribution
system consisting of two camshafts with valves located in the cylinder head, the
variator assembly comprising an automatic mechanism; a spindle for moving one
of said camshafts, a motor activated by said automatic mechanism which causes
an end of said spindle to advance and push the camshaft forward or pull it back
and a threaded sleeve as known from WO-A-82/02742.The function of valves in internal combustion engines
is related to the precise timing of the opening of the
intake valve in relation to the opening of the exhaust valve
at given points in the location of the piston, be it at the
bottom or at the top of the cylinder. To permit the outflow
of gases the exhaust valve begins to open at the end of the
third stroke and remains open during the entire fourth 
stroke, at which point the intake valve begins to open
before the first stroke. The instant during which both
valves are open is designated "overlap" or "timing" in this
description.In the systems of the prior art, based on twin or dual
overhead camshafts, in order to vary the overlap or timing
of an intake valve in respect to an exhaust valve, it is
necessary to change, the angular placement (in a vertical
plane) of one of the camshafts with respect to the other.
Once the change is accomplished the new valve overlap
remains fixed.There are known devices for changing the overlap or
timing through rotation of camshafts while the engine is in
operation. However, such devices are very sophisticated and
are currently applied only in high-performance engines.A variator of the present invention produces the
desired rotation of a conventional camshaft, as more fully
described below.A double effect distribution sequential valve shaft
system ("SVS") also performs the same rotation while also
being capable of modifying the opening section, as more
fully described below, to enlarge or reduce the space
through which the gases will flow in the distribution
system. In the prior art, the enlargement of valve area
occurs only by depressing the valve deeper, which has proven
to cause serious difficulties in the behavior of cams and springs. The present invention, unlike the

<CLAIMS>
An automatic variator assembly for varying the valve timing in a valvular
distribution system in an internal combustion engine which includes an

engine block (7), a cylinder formed in the engine block, the cylinder
having a cylinder head (5), a piston (8) slidable within the cylinder, and a

combustion chamber bounded by the cylinder and the piston (8), and a
distribution system consisting of two camshafts (2) with valves located in

the cylinder head (5), the variator assembly comprising:

an automatic mechanism;
a spindle (44) for moving one of said camshafts (2),
an electric motor (42) activated by said automatic mechanism
which causes an end of said spindle (44) to advance and push the camshaft

(2) forward or pull it back and
a threaded sleeve (34)

characterized in that

the automatic mechanism is controlled by a microprocessor;
the electric motor (42) turns a number of predetermined turns or steps for
causing an end of said spindle (44) to advance and push the

camshaft (2) forward or pull it back:
a multiple entrance grooved screw (41) is etched in at one end of
said camshaft (2), turning inside said threaded sleeve (34), in such

a way that a differential and controlled turn is produced in said
camshaft (2) whensaid spindle (44) moves said camshaft (2), causing

a rotation of said camshaft (2) and longitudinal displacement
of said camshaft (2), thereby varying the valve timing while the

engine is turning.

mechanism is activated by a signal from a tachometer and gas analyzer.
The variator assembly according to claim 1, wherein said threaded sleeve
(34) is fixed relative to and inside of a toothed pulley (49) by means of a

pin.
