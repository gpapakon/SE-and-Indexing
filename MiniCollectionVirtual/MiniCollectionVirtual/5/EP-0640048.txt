<ABSTRACT>
Safety unit for a separable linking device, especially for a motor vehicle steering column, comprising two coaxial shaft sections (1, 2) with overlapping end portions (5, 6) offset in relation to their common geometric axis. Each shaft section carries a flange (7, 8), each flange being connected to the other by separable linking spindles (15, 16). The assembly comprises a clip (30) consisting of a double-sided (31, 32) fork connected to one another by a rib (33), each of the two sides (31, 32) bearing on one side of the flange (7, 8). One of the two sides (31) includes a fastening system on one of the ends of one part of the linking spindles and the other side (32) has a stapling system on one of the ends of the linking spindle's other part, so that the clip (30) locks the axial spacing of both flanges (7, 8).

Safety assembly for a separable coupling device, 
particularly for a motor vehicle steering column, said 

assembly comprising two coaxial shaft sections (1, 2) 
having end portions (5, 6) folded in order to make a 

predetermined angle with the common geometric axis of 
said shaft sections, said end portions overlapping and 

bearing each a plate (7, 8), each plate being connected 
to the other which partially overlaps by separable link 

pins (15, 16), substantially parallel to said end 
portions (5, 6), characterized in that it comprises a 

clip (30) made up of a fork having two faces (31, 32) 
connected to each other by a web (33) so that each of the 

two faces (31, 32) bears against one outer side of the 
corresponding plate (7, 8); 


one of the two faces (31) having a system for 
attaching on one of the ends of one part of the link 

pins; 
the other face (32) having a system for clamping 
on one of the ends of the other part of the link pins; 
one of the two faces (32) being provided with 
openings intended to receive the corresponding end of the 

link pins that are not connected to it, in such a way 
that the said clip (30) blocks the axial spacing of the 

two plates (7, 8) with respect to each other when this 
spacing occurs at slow speed, while allowing this spacing 

when it occurs at high speed. 
Safety assembly according to claim 1, 
characterized in that: 


the said link pins (15, 16) fixed to each plate 
(7, 8) are engaged in holes (17, 18) provided in the 

other plate (8, 7) via bushes (19, 20); 
one of the two faces (31) of the clip (30) having 
a system for attaching on the bushes (19) of one part of 

the link pins (15, 16);  
 
the other face (32) of the clip (30) having a 
system for clamping on the bushes (20) of the other part 

of the link pins (15, 16); 
one of the faces (32) being provided with openings 
intended to receive the corresponding end of the link 

pins (15, 16) whose bushes (19) are not connected to it. 
Safety assembly according to anyone of claims 1 
or 2, characterized in that for the separable coupling 

device: 

each plate (7, 8) is provided with an orifice (9, 
10) in which the end portion (5, 6) of the corresponding 

shaft section (1, 2) is engaged; 
each plate (7, 8) comprises two lateral 
protrusions (13) which delimit between them a recess (14) 

for the passage of the end portion (5, 6) to which the 
other plate (7, 8) is fixed; 
the link pins (15, 16) are each fixed in a lateral 
protrusion (13) of each plate (7, 8). 
Safety assembly according to claim 3, 
characterized in that it comprises a fusible plate (50) 

arranged between the two plates (7, 8) and between each 
of the plates (7, 8) and the end portion (5, 6) bearing 

the other plate (7, 8), this fusible plate (50) being 
secured at each of its two ends to the side of the 

corresponding plate (7,8) in such a way that the said 
fusible plate (50) blocks the axial spacing of the two 

plates (7, 8) with respect to each other when this 
spacing occurs at slow speed and for a much lower value 

than that of the clip (30), while allowing this spacing 
when it occurs at high speed. 
Safety assembly according to any one of claims 3 
or 4, characterized in that the clip (30): 


is made up of a fork having two faces (31, 32) 
connected to each other by a web (33); 
the face (31) having an attachment system made up 
of two holes (34) receiving the bushes (19) of the link 

pins (15);  
 
the face (32) having a clamping system made up of 
two openings (35) provided with a narrowing (37) which 

receives the bushes (20) of the other link pins (16); 
the face (32) also having two holes (36) intended 
to receive the corresponding end of the link pins (15) 

whose bushes (19) are connected to it. 
Safety assembly according to any one of claims 4 
and 5, characterized in that the fusible plate (50) is 

made up of a central part (51) provided with a neck (54) 
and two ends (52, 53), the width of the central part (51) 

being chosen according to the width of the recesses (14) 
of the plates (7, 8), one of the ends (52) being shaped 

as a heel in order to bear against the face (24) of the 
corresponding plate (8), the width of the other end (53) 

being substantially equal to the width of the central 
part (51) and having two wings (55, 56) which are folded 

back against the face (22) of the other plate (7) at the 
end of assembly.
