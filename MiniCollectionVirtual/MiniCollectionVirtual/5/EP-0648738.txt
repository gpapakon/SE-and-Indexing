A process for preparing acetoacetarylamides of 
the formula I 


 
where 


R
1
 and R
2
are identical or different (C
1
-C
3
)-alkyl 
radicals, 
l and m
are each 0, 1 or 2, and 
n
is 0 or 1, 
 
by addition of diketene to the appropriate arylamine, 

characterized in that the arylamine is continuously 
reacted with diketene in the presence of a mixture of 

water and of a (C
1
-C
4
)-alkanol at temperatures from 60°C 
to 100°C for from 0.1 to 10 min. 
The process of claim 1, characterized in that the 
arylamine used is aniline, 2-methylaniline, 2,4-dimethoxyaniline, 

4-isopropylaniline, 2-methoxyaniline, 
4-ethoxyaniline, 2,4-dimethylaniline, 2,5-dimethoxyaniline, 

2-chloroaniline or 4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyaniline. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the diketene is used in an excess  

 
of from 3 to 30 mol %, in particular from 5 to 25 mol %. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the water-alcohol mixture has a 

boiling point from 70°C to 100°C. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the alcohol used is methanol, 

ethanol or propanol, in particular ethanol. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the alcohol used is ethanol and the 

mixture contains between 20 and 80 % by weight of water. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the weight ratio of amine to 

alcohol-water mixture is from 1:1 to 1:20, in particular 
from 1:1 to 1:15, preferably from 1:1 to 1:10. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the reaction is carried out in the 

course of from 0.5 to 5 minutes, preferably from 0.75 to 
3 minutes. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the reaction temperature is from 70 

to 95°C, in particular from 75° to 90°C. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the arylamine and diketene are 

metered separately. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the mixture of alcohol and water is 

recycled mother liquor. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterized in that the heat evolved in the course of 

the reaction is removed by evaporation of the mixture of 
alcohol and water. 
The process of at least one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that the process is carried out at 

atmospheric pressure, superatmospheric pressure or 
reduced pressure, in particular at atmospheric pressure.
