<ABSTRACT>
A tuyere (10) for refining molten metals or melting metal scrap 
or oxides 

charged into a vessel. The tuyere (10) comprises three concentric 
pipes (12,32,40) of 

copper or stainless steel encased in refractory (44). An annular 
stream of 

natural gas surrounds an annular stream of oxygen which in turn surrounds a 
core stream of natural gas. All three streams are expanded as they flow 

through the tuyere (10) and as a result an accretion (50) forms at 
the tip of the 

tuyere. The accretion protects the tuyere (10) and the gas streams are 
controlled 

so that the accretion (50) is maintained at a desired size which neither 
blocks the tuyere (10), nor permits burnback of the pipes (12,32,40).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to injection of inert and/or reactive gases 
into a bath of molten metal by means of a submerged tuyere. Concentric pipe tuyeres, have been applied and are used widely 
throughout the metals industry. An early patent on such a tuyere was 
French Patent 1,450,718, which described two concentric pipes to produce a 
core jet of oxygen surrounded by an annular jet of cooling gas. Since 
then, a large number of improvements have been made using either two concentric 
pipes as in French patent or two or more than two concentric pipes 
as shown in the following United States patents 
2,855,2933,893,6584,272,286 3,706,5493,897,0484,336,064 3,832,1614,022,4474,450,005 3,891,4294,138,0984,754,951 4,249,7194,887,800 The nearest prior art documents teaching a process according to the preamble of 
claim 1 are US-A-3,706,549 and US-A-3,897,048. From US-A-3,706,549 are method for refining pig-iron into steel is known, wherein 
oxygen and a protective screen of an encasing gas is blown through injecting means 
located at or near the bottom of a converter containing a melt of molten metal. The 
encasing gas while proteting the injection means, allows it to be consumed at 
substantially the same rate as the bottom of the converter so that the injecting means 
is not left projecting from the bottom of the converter. The oxygen jet in this method 
is preferably circular in cross-section and the encasing gas is in the form of a 
concentric jet. US-A-3,897,048 describes a method for operating a metallurgical vessel for treating 
molten ferrous metal. The tuyere used in this method includes three pipes arranged 
in a concentric relation to define a first passage between the outer and intermediate 
pipes, a second passage between the intermediate and inner pipes and a third passage 
within the inner pipe. The pipes are sized to permit the volumentric percentage of 
gas delivered from the first passage to be about 2 - 10 % of that delivered from the 
second and third passages and to permit the gas delivered from two of the passages 
to be about 15 - 60 % of that delivered from the other passage. In order to operate satisfactorily any tuyere for injecting fuel gas 
and oxygen into a molten metal bath, the tuyere must be operated within 
very narrow limits. If the temperature is allowed to increase too much the 
tuyere pipes melt or burn away and the tuyere fails in a short time. If 
the temperature is too low, a solid accretion forms at the tip of the 
tuyere and the tuyere becomes blocked, the flow of gas

A process for introducing oxygen and a fuel gas into a vessel 
for preheating, melting or refining metals, metal alloys, metallic and 

non-metallic oxides using a tuyere (10) which comprises three concentric tubes (12,32,40) , namely a 
central tube (12) through which a core jet of fuel gas flows into the vessel, an 

intermediate tube (32) spaced from and surrounding the central tube (12), the space 
between said central and intermediate tubes (12,32) defining an inner annulus 

through which an annular jet of oxygen is introduced into said vessel and 
an outermost tube (40) spaced from said intermediate tube (12), the space between 

said intermediate and outermost tubes (12,40) defining an outer annulus through 
which an annular jet of fuel gas is introduced into said vessel, characterized in that 

the ratio of the fully expanded core jet velocity to the 
fully expanded oxygen annulus jet velocity ranges from 0.8 to 1.4 and 

the ratio of

entering the vessel is above 75% and a protective accretion forms at the
