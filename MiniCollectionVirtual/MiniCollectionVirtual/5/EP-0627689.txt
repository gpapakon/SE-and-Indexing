<ABSTRACT>
A device for generating back-to-back data transfers on a bus in an 
information handling system 10 is disclosed. The inventive device 

includes a detector 100 for determining whether a first address value and 
a second address are within a range, a first register 104 connected to 

the detector for storing the first address until the device generates the 
second address, a second register 110 connected to the detector for 

storing the range value, and a transfer state block 108 for driving the 
second address on the peripheral bus without a turnaround cycle if the 

detector determines that the first and second addresses are within the 
range. Thus, back-to-back data transfers are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to information handling 
systems and more specifically to a method and apparatus for providing 
back-to-back data transfers on a bus that has data multiplexed on it in 
an information handling system. Referring generally to information handling systems, they normally 
have as their main component a central processing unit (CPU), which 
directs all communications in the system and orchestrates all commands to 
be executed by the information handling system. Information handling 
systems also usually have a network, or networks, of physical connection 
devices called buses. These networks connect the CPU to any number of 
peripheral devices so that the CPU can communicate with the peripheral 
devices. One type of bus that may be used in information handling systems is 
a multiplexed bus. Multiplexed buses have different signals, each 
containing different information, operating on the same communication 
line. For instance, a multiplexed bus may have information indicating a 
particular register address, and data information to be read from or 
written to that register address, multiplexed on the same communication 
line. In contrast, a non-multiplexed or parallel bus would have two 
separate communication lines, one for the address information and one for 
data. A multiplexed bus has an advantage over a parallel bus in that a 
multiplexed bus requires far less space in the information handling 
system than a parallel bus. Since each of its communication lines can 
carry more than one signal, a multiplexed bus requires approximately one 
half the amount of communication lines required by a parallel bus. 
Furthermore, the peripheral devices that are compatible with a 
multiplexed bus only require approximately one half the connection points 
to the bus, or pins, that are required by peripheral devices that are 
compatible with parallel buses. Thus, the overall size of a multiplexed 
bus is smaller than a parallel bus, and peripheral devices used with a  
 
multiplex bus are smaller than the devices used with a parallel bus as 
well. Accordingly, these smaller hardware devices require less space in 
the overall information handling system than a system using parallel 
buses. Because space is always at a premium in such systems, the 
multiplexed bus provides an advantage over the parallel bus. The use of multiplexed buses in an information handling system, 
however, creates another problem contention for the use of the bus by the 
components of the system. The
