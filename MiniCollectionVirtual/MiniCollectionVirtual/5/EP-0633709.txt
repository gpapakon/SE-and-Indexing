<ABSTRACT>
The method relates to the operating of a DC arc furnace provided with at least one bottom electrode comprising a metal busbar (current-supply bar) (5) passing through the bottom (3) of the furnace and surrounded by a lining (14) of compact refractory material comprising at least one shell ring (13) whose upper end comes into contact with the molten metal in the furnace. During restarting of the furnace after shutdowns, a self-contained sacrificial annular part (20) made of refractory concrete and having a flattened general shape is placed on the upper end (13') of the said shell ring, which part extends the said shell ring upwards and is intended to be placed in contact with the molten metal instead of the said shell ring. The method applies in particular to DC arc furnaces for the production of steel and aims to reduce wear of the refractory parts surrounding the bottom electrode.
