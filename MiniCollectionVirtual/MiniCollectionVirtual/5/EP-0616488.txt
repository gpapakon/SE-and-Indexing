<ABSTRACT>
A multi-color light-emitting element has at 
least two optical micro-cavity structures (102-106) 

having respectively different optical lengths 
determining their emission wavelengths. Each micro-cavity 

structure contains a film (105) of organic 
material as a light-emitting region. These may be a 

single film (105) of uniform thickness in the element.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to light emitting
elements employing optical microcavities. Such an
element may be used for example as a display element, a
light-emitting device for data communication, a
read/write head for data files, and a printing device
and the like in the field of data communication.In known light-emitting elements employing
organic material there can be obtained only one
emission spectrum which depends upon the nature of the
fluorescent material, when the light emitted from the
organic thin fluorescent film is used directly. It is
possible to provide a color filter in front of the
light emitting element, to remove part of the emission
spectrum. However, the peak intensity of the light
obtained is then smaller than the intensity of emission
spectrum of when no color filter is used, so that the
efficiency is greatly decreased. There has been
proposed, for instance, in US-A-4 356 429 (corresponding to JP-A-57-51781) an
electroluminescent cell in which an organic
light-emitting material and an electrically insulating
binder are interposed between transparent substrates
having transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxide.
This device does not employ the micro-cavity principle
described below. There has further been proposed a multi-color
light-emitting electroluminescent element which has a
plurality of inorganic light-emitting layers of
different emission colors that are formed on the same
substrate by utilizing different dopants in zinc
sulfide (JP-B-5-15073). This element also does not use
the micro-cavity phenomenon.The concept of optical micro-cavities, which is
employed in the present invention, is known. In an
optical micro-cavity, the optical length is
sufficiently small that it determines the peak
wavelength of the emitted light. Attempts have been
made to develop such devices for both spontaneous
emission and stimulated emission (as in a laser
device). Such a device has been realized using the
inorganic semiconductor GaAs, but is expensive to make
and is inapplicable to the production of a multi-color
light-emitting device, because of the narrow emission
frequency range of GaAs.Applied Physics Letters 63 (5), PAGES 594-5, T
Nakayama et al. "Organic-photo and electro-luminescent
devices with double mirrors", an article published
August 1993, describes an earlier development in this
field by one of the present inventors and others which
also forms the subject matter of EP-A-615 401, corresponding
to WO 94/07344 published 31 March 1994. Reference
