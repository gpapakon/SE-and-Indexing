<DESCRIPTION>
 ENZYMATIC DETERGENT COMPOSITIONSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention generally relates to the field of enzymatic detergent and cleaning compositions. More in particular, the invention is concerned with enzymatic detergent compositions comprising enzymes having lipolytic activity.BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ARTVarious types of enzymes are known as additives for detergent compositions. For example, detergent compositions containing proteases, cellulases, amylases, lipases and various combinations thereof have been described in the literature and several such products have appeared on the market. The present invention is concerned with detergent compositions comprising lipolytic enzymes or lipases. Such enzymes could contribute to the removal of fatty soil from fabrics by hydrolysing one or more of the ester bonds in tri glycerides.EP-A-214 761 (Novo Nordisk) discloses lipases whic are derived from organisms of the species Pseudo onas cepacia, and EP-A-258 068 (Novo Nordisk) discloses lipases which are derived from organisms of the genus Thermomyces (previous name Humicola) . Both patent applications also describe the use of these lipases as detergent additives. Further examples of lipase-containing detergent compositions are provided by EP-A-205 208 and EP-A-206 390 (both Unilever) , which disclose a class of lipases defined o the basis of their immunological relationships, and describe their use in detergent compositions and textile washing. The preferred lipases are those from Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas gladioli and Chromobacter species.ÎžP-A-331 376 (A ano) describes lipases, their use and their production by means of recombinant DNA (rDNA) techniques, and includes an amino acid sequence of lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia. Further examples of lipase enzymes 

produced by means of rDNA techniques are given in WO-A- 89/09263 and EP-A-218 272 (both Gist-Brocades) .In spite of the large number of publications on lipase enzymes and their modifications, only the lipase derived from Humicola lanuginosa and produced in Aspergillus orvzae as host has so far found wide-spread application as additive for fabric washing products. It is available from Novo-Nordisk under the trade name Lipolase (TM) .In his article in Chemistry and Industry 1990, pages 183-186, Henrik Malmos notes that it is known that generally the activity of lipases during the washing process is low, and Lipolase (TM) is no exception. During the drying process, when the water content of the fabric is reduced, the enzyme regains its activity

CLAIMS
1. An enzymatic detergent composition which comprises:
(a) 0.1 - 50 % by weight of an surfactant system comprising
(al) 0 - 95 % by weight of one or more anionic surfactants and
(a2) 5 - 100 % by weight of one or more nonionic surfactants; and
(b) 10 - 20,000 LU per gram of the detergent composition of an enzyme which is capable of exhibiting a substantial lipolytic activity during the main cycle of a wash process.
2. A detergent composition according to Claim 1, in which the enzyme is capable of removing at least 5% more, preferably at least 10% more oily soil, on the basis of the initial amount of oily soil, than the same detergent composition without the enzyme, in the assay as herein described.
3. A detergent composition according to Claim 1, in which the ratio of enzymatic oily soil removal by the enzyme to the enzymatic oily soil removal by Lipolase (TM) in the assay as herein described is at least 3, preferably at least 5.
4. A detergent composition according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the enzyme exhibiting lipolytic activity is a lipolytic enzyme which has a residual activity of less than 50%, preferably less than 40%, and more preferably less than 25%, after a 10 minute incubation with Di-isopropyl Fluoro Phosphate (DFP) at pH 10 at room temperature, as herein described.
5. A detergent composition according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the enzyme is an esterase or lipase.
6. A detergent composition according to any one of the preceding claims, in which the enzyme is a eukaryotic cutinase. 


7. A detergent composition according to Claim 6, in which the enzyme is a fungal cutinase.
8. A detergent composition according to Claim 7, in which the enzyme is a fungal cutinase having ste -specificity.
9. A detergent composition according to Claim 8, in which the enzyme is a cutinase selected from the group consisting of Fusarium solani pisi, Fusarium roseum culmorum, Rhizoctonia solani and Alternaria brassicicola (PNBase I) .
10. A detergent composition according to Claim 7, in which the enzyme is a cutinase obtainable from a Fusarium organism.

12. A detergent composition according to Claim 7, in which the enzyme is immunologically cross-reactive with the anti- body raised against the cutinase derived from Fusarium solani pisi.
13. A detergent composition according to any one of the preceding claims, free of anionic surfactants.
14. A detergent composition according to Claims 1-12, in which the anionic surfactant is a primary alcohol sulphate.
15. A detergent composition according to Claim 14, in which the anionic surfactant is a C12-C15 primary alcohol sulphate.
