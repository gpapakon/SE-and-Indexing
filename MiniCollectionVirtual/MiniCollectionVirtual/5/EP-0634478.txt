<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to machine dishwashing
detergent compositions exhibiting superior anti silver-tarnishing
properties.Detergent compositions designed for use in automatic
dishwasher machines are well known, and a consistent effort
has been made by detergent manufacturers to improve the
cleaning and/or rinsing efficiency of said composition on
dishes and glassware, as reflected by numerous patent
publications.The present invention is concerned with compositions for washing silverware
in automatic dishwashers, and in particular with the
silver-tarnishing problem encountered with current
detergent compositions for use in automatic 
dishwashers, such as "compact" granular products, and being
based on oxygen-bleaching species.It has been found that the compositions of the present
invention can provide excellent anti-silver tarnishing
properties, as well as optimal cleaning/rinsing performance
on dishes and glassware; The present compositions are
based on oxygen-bleaching species, and preferably are in a
compact form. The optimum anti-silver tarnishing as well
as cleaning/rinsing performance is achieved through the
combined use of paraffin oil and defined nitrogen-containing
corrosion inhibitor compounds, as well as
preferably the control of oxygen-bleaching power.EP-A-0 150,387 discloses chlorine-bleach-based machine
dishwashing compositions containing a paraffin oil as suds
suppressor; EP-A-0 186,088 discloses machine dishwashing
compositions based on carbonates and silicates, containing
paraffin oils as dust binders, and water-soluble
phosphonates at levels of 0.5 to 3%. References on corrosion
inhibition include FR-A-2,304,667 and FR-A-1,209,904 (on triazoles) and
EP-A-541,475 (on ammonium compounds). See also the not pre-published
WO-9416047, WO-9416048 and WO-A-9501416 on dishwashing
compositions containing paraffin oils.A machine dishwashing composition comprising
from 1% to 80% by weight of detergent builder compound,oxygen-releasing bleaching agent,from 0.005% to 2.5% by weight, preferably 0.1% to 0.6% by
weight of paraffin oil, andnitrogen-containing corrosion inhibitor compound
such that the nitrogen is trivalent and wherein the
nitrogen-containing corrosion inhibitor compound is not a
benzotriazole compound and is not a heavy metal ion sequestrant.In a highly preferred execution of the invention the
oxygen-releasing bleaching agent is incorporated such that
the level
of available oxygen measured according to the method
herein is from 0.3 to 1.7, preferably 0.5 to 1.2. The present
