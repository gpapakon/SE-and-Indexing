<DESCRIPTION>
"Improved Spectacles"This invention relates to improved spectacles especially but not exclusively for use in alleviating the symptoms of hay-fever.Hay fever is essentially an allergic reaction to plant pollen which causes irritation to the eyes, nose, mouth etc and is a problem which affects large numbers of people in the summer months. Various solutions have been proposed to overcome the problem or at least relieve the symptoms and, depending on the severity of the allergic reaction, these are to a degree at least effective. Generally, however treatment involves the use of some form of medicament and as such is not always available or desirable.A solution to the problem is proposed in British Patent No 1341395. In this arrangement a filtered air supply is provided to spectacle frames and exits from holes around the base of the frames adjacent to the users eyes. While the presence of filtered air may have some beneficial effect this arrangement has the disadvantage that the filtered air being blown out the base will have the effect of drawing unfiltered air around the 

top of the lens across the users eyes.It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the disadvantages of the known prior art.According to the present invention there is provided a spectacle arrangement having air supply means arranged thereon and provided with outlets for directing air towards and across a users face so as to create an area of positive air pressure around the users eyes.The air supply means may comprise an air tube attached to the spectacle frame or may be formed by a hollow section of the frame itself.Preferably the air outlets are arranged so as to direct air in several directions simultaneously.Preferably also an air pump or compressed air reservoir supply is provided for supplying the air supply means and filter means are provided for the air supply.The spectacle frame may carry plain lenses, prescription lenses, sun lenses or may be a plain frame without lenses.Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:Fig. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of spectacle arrangement in accordance with the present invention; and Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a second embodiment of a spectacle arrangement in 

 accordance with the present invention.Referring to Fig. 1 a spectacle arrangement in accordance with the present invention comprises a hollow tubular frame 1 having; legs 2; a top bar 3; a bottom bar 4, with a nose
