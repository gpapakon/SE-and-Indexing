<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to vehicle 
seats, and, more specifically, to seat belt attachments to 
vehicle seat adjusters. Seat adjusters are used on the front seat(s) of 
automotive vehicles to provide selective horizontal fore and aft, 
vertical and/or recliner movements of the seat. Such seat 
adjusters carry an upper support frame which supports the seat 
bottom and sometimes the seat back of the vehicle seat. The 
upper support frame is mounted on first and second, spaced track 
assemblies, each formed of an upper track which is connected to 
the upper support frame and which is slidably mounted in a lower 
track anchored to the vehicle floor. In a power seat adjuster, 
a drive mechanism, typically formed of a bi-directional electric 
motor, is mounted between the track assemblies and rotates a pair 
of drive shafts extending outward from the motor to a gear 
assembly or box mounted on each upper track. In one arrangement, 
the gear box rotates a lead screw extending below each upper 
track. A drive block mounted to the lower track threadingly 
receives the lead screw to cause reciprocal movement of the upper 
track and the attached upper support frame upon selective 
energization of the drive motor. Other drive mechanisms may also 
be incorporated into the power seat adjuster to provide vertical 
movement of the seat frame as well as pivotal movement of the 
seat back with respect to the seat bottom. Although such seat adjusters provide easy fore and aft 
movement of the seat in the lower tracks, it is imperative that 
the seat remain in a fixed, stationary position during a 
collision, such as a frontal collision, in order to prevent 
injury to the passenger using the seat. As a result, the weight 
and size of the seat adjuster components are selected to provide 
a maximum amount of strength to resist any movement under the 
high impact forces transmitted to the seat through the seat belt  
 
during a vehicle collision. Thus, the individual tracks, the 
torsion tubes or bars typically extending between and 
interconnecting the spaced upper tracks into a rigid structure 
and the other components of the seat adjuster are made with 
stronger materials and greater thicknesses and dimensions to 
provide the requisite amount of strength. In current usage, a fixed seat belt buckle mounting 
bracket is mounted on the rear end of one of the movable upper 
tracks. The seat belt buckle mounting brackets typically have 
an L-shape and are fixedly attached to the upper track by welding 
or by
