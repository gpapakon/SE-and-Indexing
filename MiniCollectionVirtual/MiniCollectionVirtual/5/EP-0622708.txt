<ABSTRACT>
A photoelectric sensor having a photoconductive layer 
on an electrode and used to form information on an 

information recording medium. The photoelectric sensor 
is semiconductive and has such a function that when a 

voltage is applied between the electrode of the 
photoelectric sensor and an electrode of the information 

recording medium while information exposure is being carried 
out, or when information exposure is carried out with a 

voltage being applied between the two electrodes, 
information can be recorded on the information recording 

medium with an electric current amplified to a level higher 
than the intensity of a photoelectric current induced by the 

information exposure, and that even after termination of the 
information exposure, when the voltage is continuously 

applied, the photoelectric sensor shows electrical 
conductivity and continuously effects information recording 

to the information recording medium. The photoelectric 
sensor has a photo-induced current amplifying layer provided 

between the electrode and the photoconductive layer, thereby 
enabling an image free from unevenness and noise to be 

formed with high sensitivity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photoelectric sensor
capable of recording light information on an information
recording medium in the form of visible information or
electrostatic information. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a photoelectric sensor having on an
electrode a photo-induced current amplifying layer which has
photo-induced current amplifying action and/or injection
current stabilizing action. The present invention also
relates to an information recording system including the
photoelectric sensor and an information recording medium,
and to an information recording and reproducing method
which employs the information recording system. More
particularly, the present invention relates to an
information recording system including a photoelectric
sensor having a photo-induced current amplifying layer that
markedly amplifies the information recording performance
with respect to an information recording medium, thereby
making it possible to obtain a predetermined image density
and eliminate unevenness of the recorded image and
generation of image noise, and also relates to an
information recording and reproducing method which employs
the information recording system.There has heretofore been an information recording and 
reproducing method in which a photoelectric sensor having a
photoconductive layer provided with an electrode on the
front side thereof is disposed to face, on an optical axis,
an information recording medium having an electric charge
retaining layer provided with an electrode on the rear side
thereof, and exposure is carried out with a voltage being
applied between the two electrodes, thereby enabling
electrostatic charge corresponding to the incident optical
image to be recorded on the electric charge retaining layer,
and then the recorded electrostatic information is
reproduced by toner development or electric potential
reading method, as described, for example, in Japanese
Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) Nos. 01-290366 and 01-289975.
There is another conventional information recording
and reproducing method in which the electric charge
retaining layer in the above-described method is replaced by
a thermoplastic resin layer, and after electrostatic
charge has been recorded on the surface of the thermoplastic
resin layer, heating is carried out to form a frost image on
the surface of the thermoplastic resin layer, thereby making
the recorded electrostatic charge visible, as described, for
example, in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI)
No.
