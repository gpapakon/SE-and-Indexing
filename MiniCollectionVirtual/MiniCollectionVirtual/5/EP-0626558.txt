<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a sabot (14), which can be discarded, for a sub-calibre projectile (10) which is fired from a weapon barrel provided with rifling grooves, there is a risk of the edges (27, 28) of individual segments (20) of a sabot body (16) striking against the projectile body (11) while being released from said projectile body (11). This striking against the projectile body (11) has an adverse effect on the hit accuracy and should be avoided. In order to avoid this striking, separating surfaces (29) or slots (19) are no longer arranged radially, as in the past, between the individual segments (20) of the sabot body (16), but parallel to radial planes, at a predetermined distance (d) apart, corresponding to at least half the radius (R) of the projectile body (11). The slots (23) are preferably also arranged a predetermined distance (d) apart between the segments (26) of the sabot casing (17) and parallel to radial planes.

Releasable sabot (14) for a sub-calibre projectile (10) designed
for launching from a gun barrel having helical grooves, which

sabot (14) includes a sabot body (16) and a sabot casing (17)
which are divisible into segments (20, 26) in order to facilitate

separation of the sabot (14) on exit of the sub-calibre projectile
(10) from the muzzle of the gun barrel, and separating surfaces

(29) or slots or grooves (19) with nominal breaking points (22)
are arranged between the segments (20) of the sabot body (16),


characterised in that
 the separating surfaces (26) or slots or
grooves (19) are arranged parallel to radial planes at a specified

distance (d) corresponding with at least half the amount of the
radius (R) of the projectile body (11).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the distance (d) between the separating surfaces (29) or the slots
(19) and the corresponding radial planes is greater than the

radius (R) of the projectile body (11).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in
that
 the separating surfaces (29) or slots (19) are arranged at a
distance (d) in the spin direction (C) from corresponding radial

planes.
Releasable sabot according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that

the one nominal breaking points (22) with edges (27) to be
produced during breaking and the centres of gravity (S) of the

segments (20) are arranged in radial planes which are maximum
10 angle degrees apart.
Releasable sabot according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that

the one nominal breaking points (22) and the centres of gravity
(S) are arranged in the same radial plane.
Releasable sabot according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that

the separating surfaces (29) or slots (19) are not arranged in
parallel but axially scew relative to corresponding radial planes. 
Releasable sabot according to Claim 3 with slots (23) between
the segments (26) of the sabot casing (17), 
characterised in
that
 these slots (23) are also arranged parallel to radial planes
at a specified distance (d1).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 7, 
characterised in that

the slots (23) between the segments (26) of the sabot casing (17)
are offset relative to the separating surfaces (29) or slots (19)

between the segments (20) of the sabot body (16).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the nominal breaking points (22), which interconnect the
individual segments (20) of the sabot body (16), extend over the

entire length of the sabot body (16).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the nominal breaking points (22) are located at the front and rear
end of the sabot body (16) (Fig. 8).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the nominal breaking points (22) are located at the rear end of
the sabot body (16) (Fig. 9).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that

the nominal breaking points (22) are located at the front end of
the sabot body (16).
Releasable sabot according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that

the nominal breaking points (22) which extend over the entire
length of the sabot body (16) narrow towards the front or rear (as

seen in the launch direction).
