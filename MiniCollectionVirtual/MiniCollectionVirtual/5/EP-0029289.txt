<ABSTRACT>
A serviceable welded MacPherson type strut (10) is con­
structed to allow the upper end of the support tube (12) to be 

circumferentially cut to facilitate removal of the shock absorb­
er components mounted therein so that an empty support 

tube is provided. Subsequent to such removal, a shock ab­
sorber service cartridge (54) is inserted into the support tube 

and is retained therein by a service nut (74) which is threadedly 
connected to the internal wall of the support tube.
