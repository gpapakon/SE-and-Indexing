<ABSTRACT>
The disclosure relates to a system for supplying processing 
fluid to a substrate processing chamber (18). The system 

consists of a number of fluid storages each which stores a 
separate processing fluid; at least two fluid conduits (114, 116) 

along which processing fluid flows from the fluid storages to the 
processing apparatus; and a fluid inlet which connects the fluid 

conduits to the processing chamber. The inlet has a separate 
fluid passage (108, 110) corresponding to each of the fluid 

conduits, formed along it. Each fluid passage opens at or near 
an inner surface of a wall of the chamber into a mixing zone 

(124), so that fluid moving along one fluid passage is prevented 
from mixing with fluid moving along any other 
passage until 
reaching the mixing zone. Typically at least two of the fluid 

passages are vertically displaced from one another to, at least 
partially, define upper and lower fluid flow paths. The fluid 

inlet may include a mixing cavity formed at or near the inner 
surface of the wall so that the mixing zone is defined by the 

boundaries of the mixing cavity. The mixing cavity may be a 
generally vertical channel disposed between the upper and lower 

fluid flow paths.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates 
to a method of supplying two different processing gases to a semiconductor 
wafer processing chamber. Present day equipment for the semiconductor industry is 
moving toward single substrate processing because processing 
chambers can be made smaller and processing can be better 
controlled. Further, modern semiconductor vacuum processing 
systems have been developed to carry out more than one 
processing step on a substrate without removing the substrate 
from a vacuum environment. The use of such vacuum systems 
results in a reduced number of particulates that contaminate the 
surface of the wafer during processing, thereby improving the 
device yield. A typical example of a modern CVD processing apparatus is 
shown in Fig. 1. In this figure a single substrate reactor 10 
is shown to include a top 12, side walls 14 and a lower portion 
16 that together define a chamber 18 into which a single 
substrate, such as a silicon wafer 20, can be loaded. The wafer 
20 is mounted on a susceptor 22 that can be rotated by a drive 
23 to provide a time averaged environment for the wafer 20 that 
is cylindrically symmetric. A preheat ring 24 is supported in the chamber 18 and 
surrounds the susceptor 22. The wafer 20 and the preheat ring 
24 are heated by light from a plurality of high intensity lamps, 
schematically indicated as 26, mounted outside of the reactor 
10. The top 12 and lower portion 16 of the reactor 10 are  
 
typically made from clear quartz which is transparent to the 
light from lamps 26. Quartz is generally used to make up the 
top 12 and lower portion 16 because it is transparent to light 
of both visible and IR frequencies; it exhibits a relatively 
high structural strength; and because it is chemically stable in 
the process environment of the chamber. During the deposition process, processing gas (whether 
reactant or dopant) is supplied to the interior of the chamber 
18 from an exterior source, schematically represented by two 
tanks 28. The gas flows from the gas supply 28 along a gas 
supply line 30 and into the chamber 18 via a gas inlet port 32. 
From the port 32 the gas flows across the preheat ring 24 where 
it heats up, across the susceptor 22 and wafer 20 in the 
direction of the arrows 34 to be evacuated from the chamber 18 
through evacuation port 36. The dominant shape of the flow 
profile of the gases is laminar from the gas input port 32 and 
across the preheat ring 24 and the wafer 20 to the exhaust port 
36 even though the rotation of the wafer 20 and

<CLAIMS>
A method of supplying reactant gas to a 
substrate processing apparatus having walls (14) with 

inner surfaces defining a processing chamber (218) 
housing a susceptor (22) supporting a substrate 

(20), the method comprising the steps of: 

separately supplying first and second reactant 
gases flowing along first and second gas paths (232a, 232b), 

respectively, to the processing apparatus; and 
mixing said first and second gases and causing the 

mixed gas to flow towards the substrate (20), wherein 
the chamber is divided into an upper and a lower 

portion (218a, 218b) by the susceptor (22), and 
wherein the first and second gas paths allow the first 

and second reactant gases to respectively flow into 
the upper (218a) and lower (218b) portions of the 

chamber, and the second reactant gas to flow from the 
lower to the upper chamber so as to first mix with the 

first reactant gas in the upper portion (218a) near to 
the substrate. 
A method according to claim 1, wherein the 
chamber includes a susceptor circumscribing ring (24) 

which defines an annulus between itself and the 
susceptor (22), the method further comprising the step 

of causing the second reactant gas to pass from the lower portion (218b) 
of the chamber through the annulus to mix with the 

first reactant gas in the upper portion (218a) of the 
chamber. 
A method according to claim 2, wherein the 
susceptor circumscribing ring is a preheat ring (24). 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, further comprising the step of controlling the 

flow of gas in at least one path (232a, 232b), so that 
the flow through a central zone (308) in relation to 

the substrate is controlled separately from the flow  
 

through an outside zone (310). 
A method according to claim 4, wherein the flow 
through the central zone is split into two halves 

(308a, 308b) and the method further comprises 
controlling the flow through the two halves 

independently from one another.
