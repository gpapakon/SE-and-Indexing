A method for heating a low temperature carbonization 
drum for generating a low temperature carbonization gas (s), 

wherein a heating gas (g) carried in a heating gas circuit 
(70, 72) is used which is generated by combusting a partial 

flow (t₁) of the low temperature carbonization gas (s),
 
characterised in that
 
a controllable partial flow (t₃, t₄) of the cooled heating 

gas (g) is returned to the low temperature carbonization 
drum (4) and re-admixed with the heating gas (g), after 

first preheating the cooled heating gas (g) flowing out of 
the low temperature carbonization drum (4). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the partial flow (t₁) of the low temperature carbonization 

gas (g) is carried at a reduced pressure prevailing in the 
heating gas circuit (70, 72). 
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised 
in that dust is removed from the partial flow (t₁) of the low 

temperature carbonization gas (s) prior to the combustion. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the preheating of the cooled heating 

gas (g) is effected by indirect heat exchange with steam. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that dust is removed from the cooled 

heating gas (g) prior to the preheating.  
 
Apparatus for heating a low temperature carbonization 
drum (4) which is connected in a heating gas circuit (70, 

72) through an inflow line (12) and an outflow line (14), 
the heating gas circuit (70, 72) having a combustion chamber 

(18) for generating the heating gas (g), wherein a partial 
flow (t₁) of the low temperature carbonization gas (s) 

produced in the low temperature carbonization drum (4) can 
be delivered to the combustion chamber (18),
 
characterised by a heat exchanger (80, 80' incorporated in 

the heating gas circuit (70, 72) upstream of the combustion 
chamber (18) for preheating the cooled heating gas. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in that 
a dust separation device (28) is incorporated upstream of 

the combustion chamber (18). 
Apparatus according to claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterised in that an exhaust fan (20) is incorporated in 

the outflow line (14) of the heating gas circuit (70, 72). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in that 
the pressure side of the exhaust fan (20) communicates with 

the combustion chamber (18). 
Apparatus according to claim 8 or claim 9, 
characterised in that the pressure side of the exhaust fan 

(20) communicates with a mixing chamber (16) connected 
downstream of the combustion chamber (18). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterised by a dust separation device (82) incorporated 

upstream of the heat exchanger (80, 80') in said outflow 
line (14).  

 
A low temperature carbonization/combustion plant 
comprising apparatus according to one of claims 6 to 11, 

wherein the remaining flow (t₂) of the low temperature 
carbonization gas (s) generated is supplied to a combustion 

chamber (34) of the combustion system (2). 
A low temperature carbonization/combustion plant 
comprising apparatus according to one of claims 6 to 11 

wherein steam generated in the combustion system (2) can be 
supplied to the heat exchanger (80, 80').
