<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a water-soluble carboxypolysaccharide-magnetic iron oxide complex having
a small particle diameter, which is useful in the fields of biology, medical treatment, etc. as a contrast medium for
nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (hereinafter abbreviated to MRI), an X-ray contrast medium, etc.A complex of a magnetic iron oxide having a colloid size has superparamagnetism, and an aqueous sol thereof
(i.e. a magnetic fluid) has drawn attention in recent years in the fields of medical treatment, biology and engineering
as an MRI contrast medium, in particular. When a magnetic iron oxide complex is used as an MRI contrast medium,
for example, when the complex is administered intravascularly to allow liver Kupffer's cells to capture it, the complex
may have a relatively large particle diameter; in that case, a large particle diameter is rather advantageous because
there can be obtained a large T2 -relaxivity (the T2-relaxixity is a yardstick for contrast ability). However, when the
complex is used as an MRI contrast medium moving between cells and/or tissues, it is desired that the particle diameter
of the magnetic iron oxide core and/or the total particle diameter of the complex is small and that the T2-relaxivity is
as large as possible.There have hitherto been made various disclosures with respect to compounds between magnetic iron oxide
ultrafine particles and polysaccharide. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 13521/1984 (U.S. Patent No.
4,101,435) discloses a complex between magnetic iron oxide prepared beforehand and dextran or alkali-treated dextran.
No specific particle diameter is mentioned in the literature, but the complex obtained by the method described in
the Examples of said literature has a core (magnetic iron oxide) diameter of about 7 to about 12 nm and a total diameter
of about 80 to about 200 nm when measured by methods described later.U.S. Patent No. 4,452,773 discloses microspherical magnetic iron oxide coated with dextran. According to
this literature, the core diameter is about 10 to about 20 nm and the total diameter by SEM is about 30 to about 40 nm.
P. Kronick and R.W. Gilpin, Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Methods, 12, 73-80 (1986) reports a dextran-magnetite
complex used for cell-separation, particularly antibody-bonding. The core diameter is 3 nm according to the
literature, but it is feared that the total diameter is large because of dextran use and that the complex is high in acute
toxicity (which is an important property of
