<ABSTRACT>
The dosing device (1) for a syringe comprising a carpule sleeve (13) consists of an external sleeve (2), an internal sleeve (3) that projects rearwards from the external sleeve (2), and a toothed rack (4) which can be advanced by means of the internal sleeve (3) counter to the force of a spring (8). The toothed rack (4) is provided with teeth (5) whose length L corresponds to a full injection dose. The internal sleeve (3) can be moved to and fro about the magnitude of length L between two stops (6, 7) provided in the external sleeve (2). The internal sleeve (3) is provided with engagement means (9, 10) which lock it in an opening (11) in the carpule sleeve (13) in a releasable manner relative to the latter when the foremost position is reached. Finally, there is a push-back safeguard (12) for the toothed rack (3).

A feed mechanism (1) for an injection device comprising an
ampoule casing (13) with an outer casing (2) slid into the

ampoule casing (13), an inner casing (3) in said outer casing (2)
and protruding rearwardly from said outer casing (2) and a

toothed rack (4) forwardly moveable against the force of a spring
means (8) by means of the inner casing (3),
characterized in that
A) the toothed rack (4) has a plurality of teeth (5), each tooth
(5) having a length L corresponding to one full injection dose;
B) said inner casing (3) being movable forwardly and backwardly
with the amount of the length L between two stop means (6;7)

included within the outer casing (2);
C) latch means (9; 10) carried by said inner casing (3) for
releasably engaging an aperture (11) within said ampoule casing

(13) when said inner casing (3) reaches an extreme forward
position to thereby prevent motion of said inner casing (3)

relative to said ampoule casing (13); and
D) means (12) for preventing rearward motion of said toothed rack
(4) are provided.
A feed mechanism (1) according to claim 1, characterized in
that said latch means (9, 10) includes a slider arm (10) carried

by said inner casing (3) and radially spring-urged, a pawl (9)
carried by said slider arm (10), said pawl (9) being positioned

to enter said aperture (11) lodged within the surface area of the
ampoule casing (13) when said extreme forward position of the

inner casing (3) is reached.
A feed mechanism (1) according to claim 2, characterized in
that it includes a removable safety button (16) for closing said

aperture (11) from the outside, said button (16) holding said
pawl (9) in an extreme rearward position of said inner casing (3)

such that the inner casing (3) is locked relative to said outer
casing (2).
A feed mechanism (1) according to one of claims 1 through 3,
characterized in that the inner casing (3) is fitted with a

ratchet (15) engaging the toothed rack (4) which is forced
forward when the inner casing (3) is being advanced.
A feed mechanism (1) according to one of claims 1 through 3,

characterized in that the recoil safety means (12) is a pawl
slanting relative to the longitudinal axis (17) of the said feed

mechanism (1), entering the path of advance of the toothed rack
(4) and affixed to the outer casing 2. 
A feed mechanism (1) according to one of claims 1 through 5,
characterized in that, at its rear end projecting from the outer

casing (2), the inner casing (3) is fitted with a dosing button
(18).
An injection device with a feed mechanism (1) according to one
of the claims 1 to 6, characterized through a ampoule casing (13)

for receiving an ampoule (14) of medicine at a forward end
thereof and for receiving the feed mechanism (1) at a rearward

end thereof.
