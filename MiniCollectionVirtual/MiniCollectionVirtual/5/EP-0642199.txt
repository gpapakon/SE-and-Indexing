<ABSTRACT>
In the case of electrical converters (1, 8) having a DC intermediate circuit (2), very high short-circuit currents occur in the DC intermediate circuit (2) and in the phase modules of the electrical converter (1, 8) affected, as a result of the low-impedance discharge in the event of the short-circuit of an intermediate-circuit capacitor (C1, C2, C3), unless a short-circuit current limiter (3) is used, which short-circuit currents result in high forces being applied to the structural parts and possibly lead to arcs in the electrical converter (1, 8). In order to avoid this, a reversible short-circuit current limiter (3) which has a PTC thermistor (5) is connected in a low-inductance and cooled manner in series with at least one capacitor (C2, C3) or in series with a capacitor bank of the DC intermediate circuit (2). The PTC thermistor (5) can be arranged in the DC intermediate circuit (2) or in the electrical converter (1, 8). A varistor (6) and/or a non-reactive resistor (7) and/or a diode (4), connected in the reverse direction of a short-circuit path, can be connected in parallel with the PTC thermistor (5), the PTC thermistor (5) and the varistor (6), or the PTC thermistor (5) and the non-reactive resistor (7) being capable of being combined to form one component.
