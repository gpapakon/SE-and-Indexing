<ABSTRACT>
An inspection system for a rotation preventing device comprises a 
balance weight (441) 

member disposed within a hollow portion of the compressor housing and 
at least one 

recessed portion (200) formed in an annular surface (11a) of the hollow 
portion. If, during the assembly 

of the compressor, a ball (377) from the rotation preventing/thrust 
bearing device rolls into the 

hollow portion or is accidentally dropped into the hollow portion, the 
balance weight 

member pushes the ball along the annular surface until it falls into 
the recessed portion. 

Further rotation of the balance weight locks the ball within the 
recessed portion thereby 

preventing further rotation of the drive shaft. Therefore, defects in 
assembly due to the 

rotation prevention mechanism may be easily detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scroll type fluid 
displacement apparatus comprising the features defined in the 
precharacterizing portion of claim 1. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to an improvement in the rotation 
preventing mechanism of a scroll type fluid displacement 
apparatus. A scroll type fluid displacement apparatus having the 
features defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1 is 
disclosed for example in document EP-A-0 419 204. A similar 
construction of a scroll type fluid displacement apparatus is 
disclosed in US Patent 4 892 469. Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 3, a scroll type fluid displacement 
apparatus in accordance with US Patent 4 892 469 is 
shown in the form of a scroll type refrigerant compressor unit 1. 
Throughout this description the terms "front" and "rear" are used 
to assist in the description. These terms are in no way intended 
to limit the description. With reference to Figure 1, the left of 
the figure is referred to as the "front" and the right as the 
"rear". Compressor unit 1 incudes housing 10 having front end 
plate 11 and cup shaped casing 12 which is attached to an end 
surface of front end plate 11. Opening 111 is formed in the 
center of front end plate 11 for the penetration of drive shaft 
13. Annular projection 112 is formed in the rear end surface of 
front end plate 11 and is concentric with opening 111. An outer 
peripheral surface of annular projection 112 extends into cup 
shaped casing 12. Thus, the open end of cup shaped casing 12 is 
covered by front end plate 11. O-ring 14 is  
 
placed between the outer peripheral surface of annular projection 112 and the inner wall 
of the open end of cup shaped casing 12 to seal the mating surfaces therebetween. Front end plate 11 has an annular sleeve 15 projecting from the front end surface 
thereof. Annular sleeve 15 surrounds drive shaft 13 and forms shaft seal cavity 60. Annular 
sleeve 15 is formed separately from front end plate 11, and is attached to the front end 
surface of front end plate 11 by screws (not shown). O-ring 16 is placed between the front 
end surface of front end plate 11 and rear end surface of sleeve 15 to seal the mating 
surfaces therebetween. Alternatively, sleeve 15 may be formed integrally with front end 
plate 11. Drive shaft 13 is rotatably supported by annular sleeve 15 through bearing 17 located 
near the front end of annular sleeve 15. Drive shaft 13 has a disk portion 18 at its inner 
end portion which is rotatably supported by front end
