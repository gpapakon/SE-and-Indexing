<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for delivering paging messages in a cellular communication system (10). The apparatus performs the method of paging (52) a portable communication unit (12), and upon the expiration of a paging period (58), converting the paging message into a voice mail message (60) for storage and later retrieval.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF DELIVERING PAGING MESSAGES USING VOICE MAILField of the InventionThe field of the invention relates to paging networks and, in specific, paging networks within cellular system.Background of the InventionWireless paging networks are known. Such networks typically transmit short paging messages (either audible or display) over wide geographic areas. Paging receivers (pagers) within such systems are typically constructed to monitor a paging channel for identification codes. Upon receipt of a code the pager compares the received code with an internal code. When the internal code matches the transmitted code the pager reproduces the paging message associated with such code on an output device for the benefit of a subscriber.While such systems may be effective in the market for low-cost, rapid communication, they suffer from disadvantages associated with the one-way nature of such transmissions. Where a particular pager is deactivated, or out of range, paging messages directed to that paging receiver may be lost.Other paging systems have been constructed with pagers that acknowledge paging notification messages. Such pagers are equipped with transmitters used to transmit a page acknowledge message upon detection of a page directed to the responding pager.Where the system transmits a paging notification and the paging receiver doesn't respond (unit deactivated or out of range) the system periodically retransmits the page. Upon receipt of a paging acknowledgment by the system from the receiver, the system may immediately transmit the paging message as well as any other paging messages that have 

accumulated in a message queue maintained for the pager.While deferral of message transmission until a page has been acknowledged reduces the incidence of lost messages, other problems may be experienced within such a system. Where a number of messages have accumulated in the system message queue and a page acknowledgment is received by a base site, the base site may immediately transmit all the messages in the queue. The immediate transmission of queued messages may overwhelm the storage capacity of the pager. Also, where a page acknowledge has not been received for an extended period the message queue may become filled, requiring that some messages be over- written resulting in lost information. Because of the importance of paging systems a need exists for a method of delivering paging messages that avoids lost information.Summary of the InventionA method and means of delivering paging messages in a

<CLAIMS>
 Claims
1. A method of delivering paging messages in a cellular communication system, such method comprising the steps of:
A) paging the communication unit; and upon expiration of a paging period, converting the paging message into a voice mail message.
2. The method as in claim 1 wherein the step of paging the communication unit further comprising transmitting a page notification from the base site on a radio frequency channel.
3. The method as in claim 1 further comprising the step of storing the converted voice mail message in a voice mail storage system.
4. An apparatus for delivering paging messages in a cellular communication system, such apparatus comprising: A) means for paging the communication unit; an d means for converting the paging message into a voice mail message, upon expiration of a paging period.
5. The apparatus as in claim 4 wherein the means for paging the communication unit further comprises means for transmitting a page notification from the base site on a radio frequency channel.
6. The apparatus as in claim 4 further comprising means for storing the converted voice mail message in a voice mail storage system. 


7. A method of delivering a paging message in a cellular communication system having a plurality of base sites, each with a service coverage area, and a communication unit, such method comprising the steps of:
A) receiving a paging message for the communication unit at a base site of the plurality of base sites;
B) transmitting a page notification on a radio frequency channel from the base site; and
Q upon expiration of a maximum paging period converting the page message into voice mail and storing such voice mail within a voice mail system.
8. The method as in claim 7 further comprising the step of storing the converted voice mail message in a voice mail storage system.
9. A method of delivering a paging message to a cellular communication unit within a cellular communication system having a plurality of base sites, such method having the steps of:
A) transmitting a page notification from each of the plurality of base sites; B) waiting for a maximum page period for a page response from the communication unit; and Q upon expiration of the maximum page period, converting the page message into a voice mail message and storing within a voice mail system; and D) delivering the paging message under a voice mail format. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 16 March 1994 (16.03.94); original claim 9 replaced by amended claim 9; original claims 1 and 4 amended; new claim 10 added (2 pages)]
5 1. A method of delivering paging messages in a cellular communication system, such method comprising the steps of: paging a communication unit; and upon expiration of a paging period, converting the 0 paging message into a voice mail message.
2. The method as in claim 1 wherein the step of paging the communication unit further comprising transmitting a page notification from the base site on a radio frequency 5 channel.
3. The method as in claim 1 further comprising the step of storing the converted voice mail message in a voice mail storage system. 0
4. An apparatus for delivering paging messages in a cellular communication system, such apparatus comprising: means for paging a communication unit; and means for converting the paging message into a voice 5 mail message, upon expiration of a paging period.
5. The apparatus as in claim 4 wherein the means for paging the communication unit further comprises means for transmitting a page notification from the base site on a 0 radio frequency channel.
6. The apparatus as in claim 4 further comprising means for storing the converted voice mail message in a voice mail storage system. 


7. A method of delivering a paging message in a cellular communication system having a plurality of base sites, each with a service coverage area, and a communication unit, such method comprising the steps of: A) receiving a paging message for the communication unit at a base site of the plurality of base sites;
B) transmitting a page notification on a radio frequency channel from the base site; and upon expiration of a maximum paging period converting the page message into voice mail and storing such voice mail within a voice mail system.
8. The method as in claim 7 further comprising the step of storing the converted voice mail message in a voice mail storage system.

 STATEMENTUNDER ARTICLE 19
This amendment is being filed within one month of the date of transmittal of the Notification of Transmittal of the International Search Report or the Declaration mailed 7 September 1993. The following statement is believed to be in compliance with Article 19.
Minor amendments have been made to claims 1 and 4 in order to clarify the language used. Claim 9 has been amended to more particularly point out the distinction between the Ory et al . (US-A-5,140, 626) , Wolf (US-A-5, 151, 929) , Oliwa (US-A-5, 237, 321) , and Dey (WO91/01604) references. That distinction being the use of a system having paging and voice mail capabilities and the interaction of those systems. Newly added claim 10 is being submitted as also distinguishing over the references cited in the search report in that this claim also utilizes a voice mail storage system not found in the references.
