<ABSTRACT>
Dialkyl carbonates can be prepared by reaction of carbon monoxide with alkyl nitrites in a continuous gas-phase reaction in the presence of a heterogeneous platinum metal catalyst, the activity of this catalyst being maintained by addition of small amounts of halogen. In this process, the dialkyl carbonates are formed in nearly quantitative selectivity and deactivation of the catalyst does not occur.

Process for the preparation of dialkyl carbonates of 
the formula 


O=C (OR)
2
,
 
wherein 


R
represents linear or branched C
1
-C
4
-alkyl, preferably 
methyl or ethyl and particularly preferably 

methyl, 
 
by reacting carbon monoxide (CO) with alkyl nitrites 

of the formula 

RONO,
 
wherein 


R
is as defined, 
 
in the presence of an inert gas, in the presence of 

the corresponding alcohol and in the presence or 
absence of NO, on a supported platinum metal catalyst, 

preferably on a supported palladium catalyst, 
particularly preferably on a supported Pd(II) halide 

catalyst and very particularly preferably on a 
supported PdCl
2
-containing catalyst, at elevated 
temperature in a continuous gas phase reaction,
  
 

characterized in that the reaction is carried out at 
a volume ratio of alkyl nitrite:CO = 0.1 to 10:1, 

preferably 0.2 to 4:1 and particularly preferably 
0.3 to 3:1, a pressure of 0.5 to 10 bar, preferably 

0.8 to 7 bar, particularly preferably 1 to 6 bar and 
very particularly preferably 1 to 5 bar, and a 

temperature of 50 to 170°C, preferably 70 to 160°C 
and particularly preferably 70 to 150°C, halogen 

being added batchwise or continuously. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
halogen is added in an amount such that the educt 

gas contains the halogen in a concentration of 1 to 
1000 ppm (by volume), preferably 10 - 500 ppm (by 

volume). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
chlorine or bromine, preferably chlorine, is added.
