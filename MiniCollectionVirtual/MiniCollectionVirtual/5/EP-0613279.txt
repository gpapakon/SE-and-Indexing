<ABSTRACT>
The coded signals transmitted simultaneously from both ends (2, 3) are superimposed on one another on the two-wire telephone line (1). The line can be monitored at any given point (4) only if the symbol sequences can be separated according to direction and reconstructed there without interfering with the line. The indicated method uses the knowledge of a constant, cyclically recurring signal component in signals which are otherwise unknown but whose movements follow a known statistical pattern, said component taking the place of unavailable measurement values for the input signals (U1, U2) in order to define the transmission characteristics of the line. The knowledge of the transmission channel model parameters is used to simplify the discriminators which continuously extract the input data (U1, U2) in real time from the measured signals (UM, IM) in optimum fashion.

characterised by
 filtering
