<ABSTRACT>
Three male terminals (20) are inserted respectively 
into terminal receiving chambers (2a) in a male connector 

housing (1) and a bus bar (31a) is inserted into the terminal 
receiving chambers (2a) through a through-hole (15a). As a result, 

the insertion side portion of the bus bar (31a) is press-fitted 
in reception grooves (25a) in bus bar (31a) press-fitting portions 

disposed beneath the through-hole (15a). Thus, the insertion 
side portion of the bus bar (31a) is received in the reception 

grooves (25a) in the three male terminals (30), and is mechanically 
fixed to and electrically connected to the male terminals (30), 

so that three insulated wires (30) connected respectively to 
the male terminals (20) are connected together only at the male 

connector housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector terminal-joint
structure for connecting a plurality of terminals together,
as well as to a method for mechanically and electrically
coupling metal terminals, respectively.For connecting insulated wires, juxtaposed in the same
direction, there have been used previously either a branch
connection (also called "joint") or a technique utilizing a
branch connection box.Here, the branch connection relates to a technique in
which an insulative covering is peeled from one insulated
wire intermediate opposite ends thereof to thereby expose
its conductor, and an insulative covering is peeled from a
front end portion of the other insulated wire to thereby
expose its conductor, and the two conductors are compressively
clamped together by a terminal to thereby make an
electrical and mechanical connection between the conductors.An example for a branch connection box has been proposed
in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No.
61-277180. More specifically, insulated wires, each having
a female terminal connected to its front end, are inserted
at their front end portions into a connector housing having
a plurality of terminal receiving chambers, and a plurality
of male terminals, which can be inserted respectively into
the female terminals disposed respectively in the above
terminal receiving chambers, are provided at the branch
connection box that can receive the connector housing
therein. The male terminals are connected respectively to
their mating female terminals.In this construction, the female terminals are connected
respectively to the front ends of the insulated
wires to be connected together and are inserted respectively 
into the terminal receiving chambers of the connector
housing. Then, when the connector housing is inserted
into the branch connector box, the male terminals, connected
together at the branch connection box, are inserted
respectively into their mating female terminals, so that
the plurality of female terminals and hence the insulated
wires are electrically connected together through the male
terminals.Another example for a branch connecting box is disclosed
in US-A-5,106,318.This known branch connecting box or branch circuit constituting
structure, respectively, comprises a housing including
a plurality of juxtaposed terminal chambers and
through holes formed respectively through a side wall
thereof and partition walls each provided between respective
adjacent ones of the terminal receiving chambers,
metal terminals each having a wire connection

<CLAIMS>
A connector terminal-joint structure for connecting
metal terminals (20) that are received in a plurality of

respective terminal receiving chambers (2a, 2b, 2c) formed
in a connector housing (1) comprising:


a through-hole (15a, 15b, 15c) formed in said connector
housing (1) and extending in a direction intersecting a

direction of a length of said terminal receiving chambers
(2a, 2b, 2c) in said connector housing (1), said

through-hole (15a, 15b, 15c) communicating with each of
said terminal receiving chambers (2a, 2b, 2c);
a reception portion (25) at each of said metal terminals
(20), said reception portion (25) being registrable

with said through-hole (15a, 15b, 15c); and
a short-circuiting piece in the form of a bus bar
(31a, 31b, 31c) having a length equal to a length of said

through-hole (15a, 15b, 15c) and being adapted to pass
through said terminal receiving chambers (2a, 2b, 2c) and

engage with said reception portions (25) formed on each of
said metal terminals (20) to electrically short-circuit the

metal terminals (20) together,

   characterized in that
