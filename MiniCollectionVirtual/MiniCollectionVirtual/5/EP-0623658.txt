<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to an ink composition and 
the use of such composition for invalidating bank notes or 
similar valuables by staining them permanently. As a protection against fraud, it is known to incorporate 
diphenylguanidine, preferably complexed with various agents, 
as colourless ink in valuable papers that will develop a 
conspicuous colour for example during attempted erasure by 
bleaching cheques. Diphenyl-guanidine will indeed provide a conspicuous stain 
in the case ink eradicators such as oxidising agents 
(typically sodium hypochlorite) are used during an attempt 
to remove the dye and/or the pigments which have been 
sprayed or sprinkled on the valuables. In the above prior art the inks were used for safety papers 
at the manufacturing or printing steps. However, there is a need for a coloured ink formulation 
stable for a long period of time and within a large range of 
temperature which produces stable and permanent stain that 
cannot be leached by current agents such as sodium 
hypochlorite. According to the invention, there is disclosed a stable ink 
formulation adapted for use in security devices such as in 
bank notes dispensers or transportation systems. For this 
purpose, the formulation must be stable for a long time in 
the wide range of temperature as encountered by the above 
dispensers located in public places and operating in winter 
or summer periods. According to the invention, it has been found that a di- or 
triphenylguanidine may advantageously be incorporated in a 
coloured ink which will meet the above requirement.  According to a particular embodiment, the ink formulation 
contains a dye, a pigment, a dispersant and a di- or tri-phenylguanidine 
in a suitable organic solvent. Surprisingly, it has furthermore been found that the above 
combination will result in a stable ink providing maximum 
penetration of a block of banknotes and permanent stain that 
cannot be leached using all available techniques. The formulation, incorporated in a suitable device, will in 
operation colour extensively the stack or bundle of bank 
notes in a container, the action of the ingredients being 
complementary. A device suitable for this purpose is 
disclosed in our co-pending application No. 943 
entitled "Device for Bank Note Containers" (NEC.37554/EP). The dye will perform in depth while the action of the 
pigment is more permanent and tenacious but will be more 
limited to the surface, the diffusion thereof being limited. 
The above combination results however in a
