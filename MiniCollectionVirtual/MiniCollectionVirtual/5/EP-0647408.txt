<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to the production of 
an isoflavone enriched vegetable protein isolate in 

which the weight ratio of material to extractant is 
controlled and washing of the acid precipitated protein 

curd is avoided or minimized to provide an increased 
level of isoflavones in the protein isolate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an isoflavone-enriched vegetable protein isolate and to a process for producing the same.Isoflavones occur in a variety of leguminous plants, including vegetable protein materials such as soybeans. Examples of these compounds, so far as they relate to the present invention, include daidzin, 60AC-daidzin, daidzein, genistin. 6OAC-genistin, genistein, glycitin, biochanin-A, formononetin and coumestrol. Typically these compounds are associated with the inherent, bitter flavour of soybeans and in the production of commercial products, such as isolates and concentrates, the focus has been to remove these materials. For example, in a conventional process for the production of a soy protein isolate, in which soy flakes are extracted with an aqueous alkaline medium, much of the isoflavones are solubilized in the extract and remain solubilized in the whey which is usually discarded following acid precipitation of the protein to form an isolate. Residual isoflavones left in the acid-precipitated protein isolate are usually removed by exhaustive washing of the isolate.It has recently been recognized that the isoflavones contained in vegetable proteins such as soybeans may inhibit the growth of human cancer cells, such as breast cancer cells and prostate cancer cells, as described in the following articles: "Genistein Inhibition of the Growth of Human Breast Cancer Cells: Independence from Estrogen Receptors and the Mufti-Drug Resistance Gene" by Peterson and Barnes, Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications. Vol. 179. No. 1, p. 661 - 667, August 30, 1991; "Genistein and Biochanin A Inhibit the Growth of Human Prostrate Cancer Cells but not Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Autophosphorylation" by Peterson and Barnes, The Prostate 22 : 335 - 345 (1993) and "Soybeans Inhibit Mammory Tumors in Models of Breast Cancer" by Barnes et al. Mutagens and Carcinogens in the Diet p. 239 - 253 (1990).A protein material, suitable for administration in a diet, and which is rich in these compounds, which previous processes for the production of commercial protein materials have made great efforts to remove, would, therefore, be of considerable value for the prophylaxis and therapy of various cancers.The present invention thus provides a process for preparing an isaflavone-enriched vegetable protein isolate, which process comprises:
(a) extracting a vegetable protein material containing isoflavones with an aqueous extractant having a pH above the isoelectric point of the material
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A process for producing an isoflavone enriched vegetable protein isolate comprising;

(a) extracting a vegetable protein material containing isoflavones with an aqueous extractant having a pH above the isoelectric point of the material to produce an aqueous extract of protein and isoflavones
(b) adjusting the pH of the aqueous extract of (a) to about the isoelectric point of the protein material in order to precipitate the protein material; and
(c) separating said precipitated protein material and washing said precipitated material with water in an amount by weight which is less than 4 times the weight of the protein material to provide an isoflavone enriched protein isolate.
A process according to Claim 1 wherein extraction is carried out at a pH of from 6.0 to 10.0.
A process according to Claim 2 wherein extraction is carried out at a pH of from 6.7 to 9.7.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, wherein the pH of the extract is adjusted to a value of from 4.4 to 4.6.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein the vegetable protein material is extracted with said extractant at a weight ratio of extract to material of from 5 : 1 to 12 : 1.
A process according to any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein extraction of the vegetable protein material comprises a double extraction, so that the combined weight ratio of extractant to material from both extractions does not exceed a total weight ratio of from 11 : 1 to 14 : 1.
A process according to any preceding Claim, wherein the precipitated protein material is washed with water in an amount by weight which is less than two times the weight of the protein material.
A process according to any one of the preceding Claims, including the step of dewatering the isoflavone enriched isolate,
