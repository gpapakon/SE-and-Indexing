<ABSTRACT>
A fluidized bed steam generation system (10) and method in 
which recycled flue gases are used to assist in passing 

solid particulate material from the separator (22), through the 
loopseal (28), and back into the furnace (12). The solid 

particulate material separated in the cyclone separator (22) 
is assisted by recycled 

flue gases which have passed through the heat recovery 
section (26), an air heater (32), and a baghouse (38). The use of the 

recycled flue gases decreases the oxygen content which can 
cause oxidizing or burning of the solid particulate 

material which results in overheating or agglomeration of 
the loopseal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluidized bed steam
generation system and a method of operating same and, more
particularly, to such a system and method in which
recycled flue gases are used to assist in passing
separated solids from a separator section to a furnace
section.Fluidized bed steam generation systems are well
known. In these arrangements, air is passed through a bed
of particulate material, including a fossil fuel such as
coal and an adsorbent for the sulphur generated as a result
of combustion of the coal, to fluidize the bed and to
promote the combustion of the fuel at a relatively low
temperature. When the heat produced by the fluidized bed 
is utilized to convert water to steam, such as in a steam
generator, the fluidized bed system offers an attractive
combination of high heat release, high sulphur adsorption,
low nitrogen oxide emissions, and high fuel flexibility.The most typical fluidized bed utilized in the
furnace section of these type systems is commonly referred
to as a "bubbling" fluidized bed in which the bed of
particulate material has a relatively high density and a
well-defined, or discrete, upper surface.Other types of fluidized beds utilize a "circulating"
fluidized bed. According to this technique, the fluidized
bed density may be below that of a typical bubbling
fluidized bed, the air velocity is equal to or greater
than that of a bubbling bed, and the flue gases passing
through the bed entrain a substantial amount of the fine
particulate solids to the extent that they are
substantially saturated therewith.These circulating fluidized bed systems are
characterized by relatively high solids recycling which
makes the system insensitive to fuel heat release
patterns, thus minimizing temperature variations, and
therefore, stabilizing the emissions at a low level. The
high solids recycling also improves the efficiency of the 
mechanical device used to separate the gas from the solids
for solids recycle, and the resulting increase in sulphur
adsorbent and fuel residence times reduces the adsorbent
and fuel consumption.In the event the reactor is in the form of a steam
generator, the walls of the reactor are usually formed by
a plurality of heat transfer tubes. The heat produced by
combustion within the fluidized bed is transferred to a
heat exchange medium, such as water, circulating through
the tubes. The heat transfer tubes are usually connected
to a natural water circulation circuitry, including a
steam drum, which separates the water from the converted
steam, which is routed
