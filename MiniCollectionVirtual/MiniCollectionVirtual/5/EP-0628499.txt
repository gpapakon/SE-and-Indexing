<ABSTRACT>
The waste collection device has a container (2) 
housed in a pit (10), closed by a lid (7) and supported on 

a base (1). The base (1) is mounted on a telescopic lifting 
mechanism (4,5) for moving the container (2) between a 

lowered position, whereat the base (1) is located proximate 
to the bottom of the pit (10) and a raised position, 

whereat the base (1) is located flush with the pavement 
surrounding the pit (10). A hollow column (11) is provided 

in the lid for introducing waste material into the 
container (2). Upon filling the container (2) and hollow 

column (11) with waste, spaces (12a,12b) remain empty at 
the upper part of the container. The hollow column (11) 

defines a volume which is, at most, equal to the spaces 
(12a,12b) which remain empty in the container (2). Waste 

accumulated within the column (11) is displaced into the 
empty spaces (12a,12b) in the container (2) upon removing 

the container (2) from the base (1) for emptying.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved waste
collection device.It is known that many aesthetically, functionally and
hygienically disadvantageous characteristics are linked to
the municipal solid waste collection methods currently
most commonly practiced, which consist in the use of large
bins placed at the curbside and in which users place the
waste contained in bags and other containers.In order to obviate these disadvantages, the same
Applicants have described, in EP-A-480 326 a device comprising a
structure provided with a base and a lid that are mutually
connected so as to delimit a portion of space for
accommodating a container that receives the waste. Waste is
introduced into the container through a hollow column or
chute connected to the lid of the container. The structure
is connected to lifting means that move it between a first
lowered position, in which the container is concealed
inside a pit and the lid is flush with the surrounding
paving, and a second raised position in which the structure
protrudes from the pit and the base is flush with the
pavement surface surrounding the pit.The same Applicants subsequently described, in
EP-A-608767 a device comprising a pit internally provided with a
lifting unit that moves at least one waste container from a
lowered position in which it is completely inserted in the
pit, to a raised position in which the container protrudes
completely therefrom; the pit is furthermore provided, at 
its upper rim, with an openable lid located at the level
of the surrounding paving when it is in a closed or lowered
position and comprising at least one hollow column
associated therewith for inserting waste into the at least
one container.Both of these solutions are highly effective, but
experience so far gained has allowed to provide a new
improved device aiming to optimize the operation of the
above mentioned solutions.A first of the problems to be solved is envisaged in
obtaining full replenishment of the waste container.
However, in providing the solution of this first problem, a
second problem arises envisaged in the fact that, when the
waste container or bin is fully replenished with waste
material also the hollow column or hopper through which the
waste material is discharged into the waste container or
bin is full of waste material. When the waste container or
bin is subsequently removed or discharged, the waste
material contained in the hopper is either dispersed
outside the bin or remains in the hopper, depending on the
nature of the waste material. As a

said container (2, 15, 25) is filled up through said
column.
Device according to claim 1, wherein said lifting
means (8, 9, 30) are adapted for providing relative

movement between the at least one column (11, 32) and the
