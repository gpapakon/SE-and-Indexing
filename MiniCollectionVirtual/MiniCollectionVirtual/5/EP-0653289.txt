<ABSTRACT>
For making pipes or tubular moulded products from polymer concrete, mineral moulding material is introduced into a mould device which has its principal axis (7) positioned vertically and comprises a mould core (2) and a mould case (3), and is shaken and subsequently subjected to a curing operation. The moulded product is thereby built up along its centre axis section by section by filling successive longitudinal sections of the mould cavity of the mould device with mineral moulding material and shaking the mineral moulding material in the filling region and is progressively cured in the same direction with phase displacement. The mould case (3) has for this purpose multipart case segments, which are arranged one above the other and the segment parts (7, 8) of which can respectively be moved apart out of an annularly closed operating position into an out-of-operation position, whereas the mould core (2) is subdivided into axially bound sections (9, 10, 11, 12, 13), which form different treatment zones. Mould case (3) and mould core (2) are axially movable in relation to each other, and the filling device (4) can be moved vertically up and down to a limited extent in a region above the upper end position for the case segments (6).

A method of producing pipes or pipe-like moulded bodies from
polymer concrete in which mineral casting composition is

introduced into a moulding device comprising a mould core
and a mould shell and having a principally vertical axis,

after which said composition is riddled and then subjected
to a hardening process, characterised in that the moulded

body is built up along its central axis portion-wise by the
filling of successive longitudinal portions of the mould

space in the moulding device with mineral casting
composition and riddling of the mineral casting composition

in the filling area and is then progressively hardened with
phase offset in the same direction.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
mineral casting composition introduced into the moulding

device is continually and progressively riddled and heated
along the cental axis of the moulding device.
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
for triggering the hardening process the mineral casting

composition is progressively internally and/or externally
warmed in the moulding device along the central axis of the

moulded body.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in
that the portion-wise filling of the mould space of the

moulding device with mineral casting composition takes place
intermittently.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in
that the casing is removed from the moulding device

progressively from the inside and outside of the moulded
body and along its central axis. 
A method according to Claim 5, characterised in that the
casing is stripped from the moulded body progressively,

continuously from the inside and in portions from the
outside.
A method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised in
that when the moulded body is a socket pipe, the build-up of

the moulded body is started at the socket end.
An apparatus for producing pipes or pipe-like moulded bodies
from polymer concrete with a mould device having a

principally vertical axis (7) and which comprises a mould
core (2) and a mould shell (3) and a mould space (5) bounded

by the latter and with a filling device above the top end of
the mould space, characterised in that the mould shell (3)

comprises superimposed multi-part shell segments of which
the segment parts (7, 8) are in each case adapted for

movement apart from each other, from an annularly closed
operative position into an inoperative position, the mould

core (2) is subdivided into axially defined portions
(9,10,11,12,13) which form different treatment zones, mould

shell (3) and mould core (2) being adapted for axial
movement in relation to one another and the filling device

(4) being adapted for limited vertical upwards and downwards
movement above the extreme upper position of the shell

segments (6).
An apparatus according to Claim 8, characterised in that the
treatment zones provided are a riddling zone (10) and/or a

damping zone (11), and/or a heating zone (12) and/or a
cooling zone (13).
An apparatus according to Claim 8 or 9, characterised in
that the shell segments (6) are of the same height as one 

another and can, in order to form a mould shell (3) which
grows stepwisely in height in the axial direction, be moved

successively into superposed positions and can be assembled
into one closed mould shell.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that the shell segments (6), in the

operative position of the segment parts (7, 8), can be moved
out of an extreme upper position axially along the mould

core (2) into an extreme lower position and individually and
successively out of this and back into the extreme upper

position after the segment parts (7, 8) have moved into the
inoperative position.
An apparatus according to Claim 11, characterised in that
the shell segments are guided in a closed circuit by

guidance means (38,39;40,41) and motional drives
(42,43,44,45,46).
An apparatus according to Claim 12, characterised in that
the shell segments (7, 8), on their way back from the lower

extreme to the upper extreme position can temporarily be

folded about a vertical axis and into an inspection and
maintenance position.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 8 to 13,
characterised in that in their operative position the shell

segment parts (7, 8) can be interlocked with one another and
shell segments (6) which are adjacent one another in

operation can be interlocked in respect of one another.
An apparatus according to one of Claims 8 to 14,

An apparatus according to Claim 16, characterised in that
the tubular foil (30) consists of a plurality of flat sheets
