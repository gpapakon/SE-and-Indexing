<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curable composition based
on an epichlorohydrin polymer having excellent vulcanization
properties and storage stability.It is already proposed by Daiso Co. Ltd. that a composition
comprising an epichlorohydrin polymer can be effectively vulcanized by
2,3-dimercaptopyrazine, 2,3-dimercaptoquinoxaline or derivatives
thereof in the presence of a metal compound acting as an acid acceptor
[cf. Japanese Patent Kokai Publication Nos. 122865/1981,
122866/1981, 227946/1984 and 227947/1984 (Japanese Patent Kokai
Publication Nos. 122865/1981 and 122866/1981 correspond to USP No.
4,357,446)]. However, these vulcanizable compositions have an
increase of viscosity because of vulcanization during the storage of the
compositions so that it is difficult to shape the compositions. These
compositions have poor storage stability, and the improvement of the
storage stability is desired.An object of the present invention is to provide a vulcanizable
composition based on an epichlorohydrin polymer, which has a high
vulcanization rate and an excellent storage stability for a long time.This object has been solved by incorporating
a hydrotalcite compound in a
composition comprising an epichlorohydrin polymer and a 2,3-dimercaptopyrazine
or 2,3-dimercaptoquinoxaline derivative
vulcanizing agent. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention
provides a vulcanizable composition comprising
(a) 100 parts by weight of an epichlorohydrin polymer;(b) 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a 2,3-dimercaptopyrazine derivative of
the formula:

or, a 2,3-dimercaptoquinoxaline derivative of the formula:

wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 are the same or different, each is a
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and(c) 1 to 10 parts by weight of a hydrotalcite compound.Fig. 1 shows vulcanization curves of compositions of Examples
3-6 immediately after mixing the ingredients.Fig. 2 shows vulcanization curves of compositions of
Comparative Examples 1 and 2 immediately after mixing the
ingredients.Fig. 3 shows vulcanization curves of compositions of
Comparative Examples 3-7 immediately after mixing the ingredients. Fig. 4 shows vulcanization curves of compositions of Examples
9-12 immediately after mixing the ingredients.Fig. 5 shows vulcanization curves of compositions of
Comparative Examples 8 and 9 immediately after mixing the
ingredients.The epichlorohydrin polymer (a) means a homopolymer of
epichlorohydrin or a copolymer of epichlorohydrin with another epoxide
such as ethylene oxide,
