<ABSTRACT>
A meat slicing machine has a frame (1) and a meat supporting bed (2) having a load cells (3) associated with supporting bed (2) for weighing the meat product on the bed. Gripper claws of a gripper box (4) are adapted to grip the meat product. A pressure plate (5) having a limit switch (6) is adapted to be engaged by the meat product. A shear-edge (7) is provided on frame (1) as the meat product passes under measuring lasers (8). A profile finger (9) measures the width of the meat product. Lasers (8) or potientometers (10) measure the height of the product. The lead screw (11) pushes the meat product towards the pressure plate (5) to measure the length of the product. The method involves weighing the meat product, measuring the height, length and width of the meat product; determining the volume and density of the meat product; and slicing a portion of the meat product having a predetermined weight into a plurality of slices having a uniform thickness.

<DESCRIPTION>
Title: MEAT SLICING MACHINE AND METHOD OF USE THEREOFTECHNICAL FIELDMy invention relates to a meat slicing machine and method of use thereof, and more particularly, to a machine to slice bacon and the like.BACKGROUND ARTSlicing machines of the prior art comprise a rotating blade which either has a spiral cutting edge or a circular cutting edge and is mounted for planetary motion, and means to feed the product towards the blade so that upon each revolution or each gyration of the blade, one slice is cut from the face of the product. The means to feed the product may be a continuous conveyor but usually the slicer includes a fixed platform on which the product is placed and a feeding head which engages the rear face of the product and which urges it towards the blade.. The feeding head is moved by a timing belt or by a lead screw driven by a stepping or variable speed electric motor.Meat slicing machines have a common application in the meat industry. They serve to slice raw/cooked meat products like beef, bacon and ham, etc., into consumer usable portions. These portions may be selected by weight, size or number of slices. The trend today and indeed the demand is for fixed weight portions with a fixed number of slices per pack and at a fixed price.The present slicing machines whilst very expensive fail to achieve fully the performace demanded by the meat industry. This is particularly 

true in the bacon processing industry where the endeavour is to produce packs of sliced rashers of even slice thickness to a fixed target weight. The present slicing machines' failure is due mainly in part to the varying dimensions/density factors that the raw material presents.More recently, slicing machines have been made more sophisticated by the inclusion downstream of the slicing machine of means to weigh a group of slices cut by the slicing machine, and then, in dependence upon the weight of this preceding group, vary the speed of movement of the product towards the blade by a feedback system to insure, as far as possible that each slice has a particular, predetermined weight. This apparatus is very complicated, and inevitably, there is some time lag between the cutting of a group of slices and the determination that the group has been cut too thickly or too thinly.Further developments made use of the differences between pieces of meat products by weighing the piece and measuring its length to achieve its "weight per unit length. " Further use has been made of the well- known fact that meat products have a "weight

Claims ;
1. A meat slicing machine, comprising, a machine frame, a bed for supporting a meat product, a weight determining means associated with said bed for weighing said meat product, measuring means on said frame for determining the height, length and width of said meat product, computer means operatively connected to said weight determining means, and said measuring means to determine the weight, volume and density of said meat product, and a meat slicing means to slice a given volume of said meat product into a plurality of slices of uniform thickness to create a group of slices of a predetermined total weight.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein laser means is used to determine the height of said meat product.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the means for measuring the length of said meat product includes a lead screw device to push the product towards a pressure plate, and release means connected to said pressure plate to stop the action of said lead screw when said pressure plate is contacted by said meat product.
4. The apparatus of claim 3 wherein an encoder is operatively connected to said lead screw to measure the travel of said lead screw, said encoder being linked to said computer means. 


 5. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein measurement means includes potientometer means to determine the height and width of said meat product.
6. The method of slicing a meat product comprising, taking a meat product having a length, width and height, weighing said meat product, measuring the height, length and width of said meat product, determining the volume and density of said meat product, slicing a portion of said meat product having a predetermined weight into a plurality of slices of uniform thickness. 

AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 7 October 1993 (07.10.93); original claims 3 and 4 amended; remaining claims unchanged (1 page)]
1. A meat slicing machine, comprising, a machine frame, a bed for supporting a meat product, a weight determining means associated with said bed for weighing said meat product, measuring means on said frame for determining the height, length and width of said meat product, computer means operatively connected to said weight determining means, and said measuring means to determine the weight, volume and density of said meat product, and a meat slicing means to slice a given volume of said meat product into a plurality of slices of uniform thickness to create a group of slices of a predetermined total weight.
2. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein laser means is used to determine the height of said meat product.
3. The apparatus of claim 1 wherein the means for measuring the length of said meat product includes a longitudinal pushing device to push the product towards a pressure plate, and release means connected to said pressure plate to stop the action of said longitudinal pushing device when said pressure plate is contacted by said meat product.
4. The apparatus of claim 3 wherein an encoder is operatively connected to said longitudinal pushing device to measure the travel of said longitudinal pushing device, said encoder being linked to said computer means. 


 STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE19
Original claims 3 and 4 have been amended so that the original words "lead screw" therein have been deleted, and the words "longitudinal pushing device" have been substituted therefore.
These amendments do not have any impact on the description and the drawings, and no changes therein are required. The longitudinal pushing device is the lead screw (11) and gripper-rbox (4) shown in Fig. 2 and are discussed generally at page 4 of the description of the invention.
