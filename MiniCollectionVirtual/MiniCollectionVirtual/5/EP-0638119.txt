<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to chimeric receptor
genes suitable for endowing lymphocytes with antibody-type
specificity, to expression vectors comprising said chimeric
genes and to lymphocytes transformed with said expression
vectors. Various types of lymphocyte cells are suitable, for
example, cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, natural killer (NK)
cells, etc. The transformed lymphocytes are useful in
therapeutic treatment methods.Cells of the immune system are known to recognize and
interact with specific molecules by means of receptors or
receptor complexes which, upon recognition or an interaction
with such molecules, causes activation of the cell to perform
various functions. An example of such a receptor is the
antigen-specific T cell receptor complex (TCR/CD3).The T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) is responsible
for the recognition of antigen associated with the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC). The TCR expressed on the
surface of T cells is associated with an invariant structure,
CD3. CD3 is assumed to be responsible for intracellular
signalling following occupancy of the TCR by ligand.The T cell receptor for antigen-CD3 complex (TCR/CD3)
recognizes antigenic peptides that are presented to it by the
proteins of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).
Complexes of MHC and peptide are expressed on the surface of
antigen presenting cells and other T cell targets. Stimulation
of the TCR/CD3 complex results in activation of the T cell and
a consequent antigen-specific immune response. The TCR/CD3
complex plays a central role in the effector function and
regulation of the immune system. Two forms of T cell receptor for antigen are
expressed on the surface of T cells. These contain either
α/β heterodimers or γ/δ heterodimers. T cells are capable
of rearranging the genes that encode the α, β, γ and δ
chains of the T cell receptor. T cell receptor gene
rearrangements are analogous to those that produce functional
immunoglobulins in B cells and the presence of multiple
variable and joining regions in the genome allows the
generation of T cell receptors with a diverse range of binding
specificities. Each α/β or γ/δ heterodimer is expressed on
the surface of the T cell in association with four invariant
peptides. These are the γ, δ and ε subunits of the CD3
complex and the zeta chain. The CD3 γ, δ and ε
polypeptides are encoded by three members of the immunoglobulin
supergene family and are found in a cluster on human chromosome
11 or murine chromosome 9. The zeta chain gene is found
separately
