<ABSTRACT>
In foam molding for molding a foam-molded article 
from a foaming material, heat is applied while 

controlling the amount of foaming by controlling the displacement or 
pressure change of the heating elements. At a certain stage, the 

heating of the foaming material is removed and the foaming material 
is molded i
nto a desired shape. The foaming material can be molded 
into a prescribed shape and at high speed even if the molded 

article is a complicated one.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a foam molding method for
molding a foamed material into a prescribed shape at
high speed for mass production, and to a foam molding
apparatus for practicing this method.Examples of the prior art pertaining to this
technical field are as follows:
(1) A method of molding a foamed structure is
disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent
Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No. 63-315229, by way of
example.
According to this foam molding method, a foam
structure which has already been foamed comprising a
surface skin of a fiber-reinforced thermoplastic
synthetic material and a thermoplastic foamed body is
subjected to heating to impart the structure with a
property which allows it to be deformed and worked, the
heated sheet is provided with a desired structure and
shape and the final product is then cooled to achieve
molding.With this foam molding method, however, a foam body
which has already been foamed is molded by being
reheated. A foam body already foamed is easily flawed
by molding and therefore it is difficult to obtain a
molded article having a foam body of high quality. (2) A method of molding a foamed structure while
foaming is in progress is disclosed in the specification
of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No.
62-214938, by way of example.
This foam molding method comprises steps of
laminating a polypropylene foaming sheet, which contains
a foaming agent, and a skin of sheet material, producing
foaming by heating the laminate to a temperature greater
than the foaming temperature of the foaming agent, and
molding the laminated sheet, which has been foamed or is
in the processing of being foamed, into a desired shape.According to this foam molding method, however,
sudden foaming generally is produced when the foaming
sheet is heated to a temperature above the foaming
temperature. As a result, the molding speed is not high
enough to keep up with foaming and it is difficult to
obtain a satisfactory foam body.(3) A method of obtaining a molded body by freely
foaming a foaming resin inside a mold is in wide use
since this method provides a comparatively satisfactory
core. Such a method is disclosed in the specifications
of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (KOKAI) No.
60-222211 and Japanese Patent Publication (KOKOKU) No.
3-74172.According to these foaming methods, however, there
is a limitation upon shape. Moreover, since heating and
molding are carried out inside the same mold, heating
and cooling of the mold take time. For this reason, 
these methods are

A method of molding a foam-moulded article from a foaming material,
the method comprising the sequential steps of: applying heat to the foaming material

whilst controlling the amount of foaming of the foaming material; halting
control of the amount of foaming of the foaming material; removing the

application of heat to the foaming material; and molding said foaming material
into a desired shape, characterised in that the foaming material initially takes

the form of a sheet material held between a pair of heating elements, the step of
applying heat to the foaming material being carried out with the heating

elements in contact with the sheet material.

foaming of the foaming material involves pressurising the foaming material

between the heating elements by applying pressure to the heating elements.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the pressure applied to the
foaming material is controlled by sensing changes in displacement of the

heating elements.
A method according to claim 2, wherein the pressure applied to the
foaming material is controlled by sensing changes in the pressure applied to the

heating elements.
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the step of halting
control of the amount of foaming of the foaming material involves removal of

the pressurising force applied to the foaming material. 
A method according to any preceding claim, wherein the step of
removing the application of heat to the foaming material involves removing the

heating elements from contact with the foaming material.

for molding the foaming material into a desired shape, characterised in that the

means for applying heat to the foaming material whilst controlling the amount
of foaming of the foaming material comprises a pair of heating elements (3, 4)

contactable with a sheet (1) of the foaming material held therebetween.
A molding apparatus according to claim 7, wherein the means for applying
heat to the foaming material whilst controlling the amount of foaming of the

foaming material further comprises means (5, 6) for applying pressure to the heating
elements to pressurise the foaming material therebetween.
