<ABSTRACT>
The process consists in reacting aluminium nitride with  alpha -alumina and with an alumina with a high specific surface or a precursor which generates an alumina with a high specific surface. More precisely, the process consists in mixing the aluminium nitride, the  alpha -alumina and the alumina with a high specific surface or the precursor of such an alumina, in drying the said mixture, in heating the said mixture at a temperature sufficient to obtain a gamma -aluminium oxynitride powder and then in grinding the powder thus obtained. The agglomerated  gamma -aluminium oxynitride powder is characterised in that the porosity of the agglomerate is greater than 75%. The ground  gamma -aluminium oxynitride powder is characterised in that 100% of the particles have a size of less than 10  mu m and in that it has a transmittance of at least 8% measured at 2500 cm

ina
or the precursor are chosen so that the mixture has a

specific surface of between 6 and 350 m
2
/g and an
apparent density lower than 1 kg/dm
3
.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the drying is carried out with the aid of a dry gas

or gas mixture chosen from nitrogen, argon, helium, xenon
and air and at a temperature lower than 700°C.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the reaction temperature is between 1650 and 1900°C.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that heating is carried out in the presence of a dry gas

chosen from nitrogen or the gas mixtures containing
nitrogen which do not contain any oxygen atom.
