<ABSTRACT>
In a magnetic recording system, a loop-back test 
circuit is provided to test certain signals written to a 

recording head for comparison with a corresponding read 
signal. Initially, a test signal, which is a current 

sent by a write circuit to a read-write head, is sensed 
through the voltage generated at the head by the test 

current, such that a small voltage portion of the test 

signal is transferred through a resistor to a read 
circuit. The voltage portion is then filtered through a 

capacitor to form detectable peaks such that the read 
signal is generated with pulses corresponding to the 

peaks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic data storage 
systems, particularly to circuits for testing magnetic 
recording systems. Systems for recording electronic signals in magnetic 
media perform two basic operations: writing signals to the 
media, and reading recorded signals from the media. In 
conventional recording systems, these operations are 
performed by separate read and write circuits. If functional problems occur during the operation of the 
recording system, various tests may be performed to isolate 
possible problem sources, e.g., either to the magnetic media, 
the read circuit, or the write circuit. Because such 
problems often arise in the magnetic media, it is desirable 
to provide a circuit which initially tests the read and write 
circuits, thereby quickly eliminating the read and write 
circuits as potential problem sources. Accordingly, test circuits, known as "loop-back" 
circuits, are provided for testing read and write circuits in  
 
magnetic recording systems. Generally, loop-back circuits 
operate by sending signals from the write circuit to the read 
circuit, while such circuits are disconnected from the 
magnetic head. In this way, the loop-back circuit may 
determine whether the read and write circuits are functioning 
correctly. Because conventional loop-back circuits disconnect the 
read and write circuits from the read-write head during 
testing, functional problems in the head are not detectable 
by such loop-back circuits. Also, when used for testing 
recording systems known as disk-duplication systems, wherein 
multiple signal channels are used for reading or writing 
simultaneously to both sides of a magnetic disk, loop-back 
circuits may give rise to signal interference between such 
channels. This cross-coupling problem might occur, for 
instance, when loop-back circuits are positioned closely to 
sensitive read or write circuits. Loop-back circuits have not been used widely in low-cost 
recording systems because loop-back circuits are relatively 
complex and typically require a number of components, such as 
switch relays and transformers, which increase the cost of 
each system. For example, to operate properly, each 
loop-back circuit must include a circuit for modifying the 
signal sent from the write circuit to the read circuit. The  
 
modifying circuit is needed to attenuate the write 
signal, which is typically several thousand times higher 
in amplitude than signals provided properly to the read 
circuit. Moreover, in digital recording systems, the modifying
