<ABSTRACT>
A system for allowing a user to disable an apnea alarm in an anaesthesia system
when the anaesthesia ventilator is in the mechanical ventilation mode. The

system takes advantage of the redundancy of both a CO2 monitor and a volume
monitor triggering the apnea alarm based upon a predetermined fault condition.

The inventive system allows the user to disable the apnea alarm based upon a
signal from the volume monitor to alleviate the problem of spurious alarm signals

from the volume monitor. The attempt to disable the volume monitor fault
signal to the apnea alarm is prevented, however, without a system check by a

CPU to insure that the CO2 monitor is, in fact, fully operational and capable of
sending its fault signal to the apnea alarm to trigger that alarm. The system

continuously checks the CO2 monitor and immediately restores the viability of
the volume monitor as a trigger for the apnea alarm at any time the CO2 monitor

becomes disabled and is unable to trigger the apnea alarm itself. Thus the
volume monitor based apnea alarm may be disabled by the user without

compromising the alarm function of the overall anaesthesia system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medical equipment and, more particularly, to integrated 
anaesthesia machines where a patient is induced and retained under anaesthesia 
and where various parameters of the patient and the anaesthesia machine are 
continuously monitored. Anaesthesia machines and/ or systems are regularly used to maintain a patient 
undergoing surgery in a state of anaesthesia and include various components, 
including vaporizers, to produce an anaesthetic vapour from a liquid anaesthetic, 
flowmeters and control valves for introduction of a carrier gas to carry the 
anaesthetic to the patient and a series of monitors that carefully monitor various 
conditions of the patient and the status and operating condition of the 
anaesthesia system itself. Current anaesthesia machines carry a variety of such monitors, including CO2 
monitors, volume monitors, oximeters, blood pressure monitors, airway pressure 
monitors and the like. Many of the monitors are integrated into the anaesthesia 
machine in order to localize all such monitors into a convenient location and to 
make use of the function of each of the monitors. In addition, such machines 
also provide a variety of alarms that are activated to alert the user as to a 
condition that should be investigated so as to protect the patient who, for 
obvious reasons, is unable to alert the attending personnel as to any such 
problems. The present invention relates specifically to the alarm known as an apnea alarm 
and which signals an alarm condition when there is an indication that breathing 
has ceased or has been reduced to an unacceptable level. At present, the 
apnea alarm is commonly triggered based upon signals from two monitors, the 
CO2 monitor and the volume monitor. The CO2 monitor analyzes the level of  
 
CO2 in the patient's breathing circuit for both inspired and expired gases and 
that CO2 level produces a well known wave shape during normal ventilation. 
The volume monitor continuously monitors the volume of gas expired by the 
patient and its transducer or sensor is also located in the patient breathing 
circuit near the patient. As indicated, both the CO2 monitor and the volume monitor can trigger an alarm 
to indicate an apnea condition. Typically, the apnea alarm is triggered if the 
volume monitor does not indicate an increase in exhaled volume from the patient 
within a specific period of time, for example 30 seconds. Similarly, the CO2 
monitor must receive and monitor the representative waveform within , for 
example, the same

<CLAIMS>
In an anaesthesia system for providing an anaesthetizing gas to a 
patient through a patient circuit, and including an anaesthesia ventilator 12 

having a mechanical ventilation mode, a CO2 monitor 18 for monitoring the 
level of CO2 in the patient circuit, a volume monitor 22 for monitoring the 

volume of exhalation from the patient into the breathing circuit and an apnea 
alarm 20 responsive to a predetermined fault condition in the CO2 level detected 

by the CO2 monitor and a predetermined fault condition in the exhaled breath of 
the patient detected by the volume monitor, an improvement characterised by a 

system to disable selectively the apnea alarm 20 from responding to the fault 
condition detected by the volume monitor 22, said system further preventing the 

selective disablement of such apnea alarm 20 when the CO2 monitor 18 is not 
itself capable of communicating its fault signal to trigger said apnea alarm 20 

and said system further including means to reactivate said volume monitor 22 to 
trigger said apnea alarm 20 whenever said CO2 monitor 18 becomes disabled. 
A system for disabling said apnea alarm 20 based upon said volume monitor 
22 as claimed in Claim 1, wherein said system includes a CPU 14 that queries 

said CO2 monitor 18 to determine the active or inactive condition of said CO2 
monitor 18. 
A system for disabling said apnea alarm 20 based upon said volume monitor 
22 as claimed in Claim 2, wherein said CPU 14 reactivates said volume monitor 

22 to trigger said apnea alarm 20 whenever said CO2 monitor 18 becomes 
disabled. 
A system for disabling said apnea alarm 20 based upon said volume monitor 
22 as claimed in Claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein said system comprises a means to 

 
determine when said CO2 monitor 18 is temporarily disabled, said means being 

adapted to operate at predetermined timed intervals.

monitor 18 is temporarily disabled operates at timed intervals of about thirty

patients circuit and a volume monitor 22 monitoring the volume of breath 
expired by the patient, an apnea alarm 20 activated by a signal from either of 

the CO2 and volume monitors upon detection, respectively , of a predetermined 
fault condition detected in the CO2 level in the patients circuit and in the volume 

of the patients exhalation characterised by the steps of: 

(a) activating a signal to disable the input from the volume monitor 22 to trigger 
the apnea alarm 20, 
(b) determining the status of the CO2 monitor 18 to determine whether it is 
operational, and 
(c) negating the disablement of the input from the volume monitor 22 to the 
apnea alarm 20 if the CO2 monitor 18 is determined in step (b) not to be 

operational.
