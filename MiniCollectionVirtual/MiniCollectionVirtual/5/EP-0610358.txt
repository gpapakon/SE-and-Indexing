<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the liquefaction of grain starch in the 
production of dextrose, fructose, alcohol and the like at pH's less than 6 
using alpha amylase. It also relates particularly to the addition of an 
antioxidant to the process to reduce liquefaction time and consistently 
achieve adequate liquefaction at below pH 6. Grains such as corn have long been used as a source of starch. One of the 
classic methods of separating the starch and then using it in other 
industrial processes is the wet-milling process. This method is a highly 
specific and integrated system developed to separate the major components of 
a grain kernel as completely as possible (see Stanley A. Watson, Starch: 
Chemistry & Technology, Vol. II, Industrial Aspects, Academic press, New 
York, 1967, pp 30-51). A final granular starch slurry coming out of the wet 
milling process can be used in a variety of industrial processes. One of the most important processes is the conversion of starch to high 
fructose syrup. In practice, this conversion involves four major steps; 
namely liquefaction of granular starch slurry, saccharification of the 
liquified starch into dextose, purification, and then isomerization of 
dextrose into fructose. The most common grain used in this process is corn 
in the production of high fructose corn syrup (See N.H. Aschengreen, et al, 
Starch, Vol. 31, pp 64-66 (1979)). During the four step conversion to 
fructose, it is currently necessary that the granular starch slurry is 
varied widely in pH. The pH of the slurry coming out of the commercial wet-milling 
operation is about 4, then raised to a pH of from 6-6.4, and calcium 
is added along with enzyme. For saccharification of the starch the pH is 
lowered to 4.3-4.5 and for the final isomerization the pH is increased back 
to about 7.8. The result of these wide shifts in pH is a high ion exchange 
requirement to desalt the syrup during and after processing. Furthermore, 
high pH causes byproduct formation, sugar breakdown, color formation, and an 
overall decrease in product yield. These factors add millions of dollars  
 
annually to the cost of high fructose syrup production. The industrial 
isomerization process is currently very efficient due to current processing 
techniques and the short processing time. Accordingly, it would be useful 
if the liquefaction step could be carried out at lower pH's to obviate the 
need for a pH shift in commercial processes. It is possible to perform 
liquefaction at pH's less than 6 (see e.g. U.S.
