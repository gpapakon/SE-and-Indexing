A power generation layer (11A,11B) includes three layers of a 
fuel electrode (12), a solid oxide electrolyte (13) and an oxygen 

electrode (14). Both faces of the power generation layer are formed 
with a number of dimples (15A,15B) that are shaped and arranged so as to 

satisfy

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a SOFC (solid oxide
electrolyte fuel cell) and, more specifically, to a SOFC as defined in the preamble portion of the claim which
can be used as a cell for water electrolysis, CO2 electrolysis
and other electrolyses, as well as for power generation.The present inventors have proposed a structure in
which an oxygen electrode layer and a fuel electrode layer are
jointed to the respective faces of a solid oxide electrolyte
layer to constitute a 3-layered power generation layer and the
power generation layer is formed with a number of dimples on
both sides in Japanese Laid-open Utility Model Application No.
Hei. 4-8259 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Application No. Hei.
6-215778 both entitled "Solid Oxide Electrolyte Fuel Cell."
The former simply proposes provision of the dimples, and the
latter is directed to optimization of electrical connection
between the dimples and interconnectors. Another prior art solid electrolyte fuel cell is
described in JP-A 22 76 166. In this fuel cell the
projections are formed only in a solid electrolyte plate and
the current collectors are arranged as plates on the peakes
on both sides of the solid electrolyte plate. No mention is
made as to the specific structure and arrangement of the
projections with respect to providing optimum values of the
projection diameter, height and pitch under consideration of
the flow of oxygen and fuel gas in accordance with the
pressure loss.An object of the present invention is to provide a solid
oxide electrolyte fuel cell in which the power output
performance is improved. Another aspect of the invention is to enable selection of a
dimple shape in accordance with applications such as a large-capacity
application and a closed-space, small-capacity
application.To improve the power output performance in terms of
shape, the main point is how to increase the reaction area for
a certain fixed capacity. Further, a consideration needs to be
given to a gas flow.It is desired that dents, in other words, protrusions
that are arranged on the power generation layer constituted of
the three layers of the fuel electrode, solid oxide electrolyte
and oxygen electrode should be circular for the gas flow, and
rectangular for the reaction area.However, since a plurality of power generation layers
are deposited and a gas inlet and outlet are arranged to face
each other, a priority is given to the consideration of the gas
flow in view of a pressure loss. Therefore, the protrusions,
i.e., the outer surfaces of the dimples are
