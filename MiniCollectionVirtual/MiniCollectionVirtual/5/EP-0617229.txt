<ABSTRACT>
A luminaire body (10) has an annular fastening region (11) which surrounds a luminuous means insertion opening (12) and is arranged for the purpose of at least indirectly and releasably mounting on a lamp carrier having luminous means socket fitting (F). The luminaire body (10) which has a hollow luminaire body (13) of glass or the like accommodates a hollow screening body (15), which is continuous in a bonded and integral manner and which serves both to accommodate the lighting means socket fitting (F) and the lighting means (L). The hollow screening body (15) forms with the one end the annular fastening region (11) which faces the lamp carrier and projects out of the hollow luminaire body (13) and with the other end a screening region (A) which projects into the hollow luminaire body (13) and which is like matt glass or milk glass. The hollow screening body (15) has at a distance from the annular fastening region (11) an annular supporting surface, on which the hollow luminaire body (13) is placed with a counter-supporting surface, is centred and fastened.
