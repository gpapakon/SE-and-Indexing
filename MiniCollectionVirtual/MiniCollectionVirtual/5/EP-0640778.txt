<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an extended tooth 
contact harmonic drive gearing apparatus for transmitting 

rotary motion from an input drive to an output drive 
through mating contact between an externally toothed, 

deformable flexspline (26) and an internally toothed, rigid 
circular spline (28), the flexspline being swept into a 

non-circular shape by rotation relative thereto of an oval 
wave generator (12). The wave generator (12) causes the 

teeth (30) of the flexspline (26) to precess angularly 
relative to a line radial to the axis of the circular 

spline (28) and the wave generator (12), from a normal to 
an inclined orientation and back to a normal orientation 

again. The teeth (30, 32) on both the flexspline (26) and 
the circular spline (28) have a profile which accommodates 

that tooth inclination, and thus avoids interference therebetween.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to harmonic drive or strain 
wave gearing, and more particularly to improved tooth 
profiles of a flexspline (a flexible circular spline or 
ring gear) and a rigid circular spline or ring gear in 
harmonic drive devices. The original harmonic drive strain wave gearing was 
introduced by Musser in U.S. Patent 2,906,143. A harmonic 
drive strain wave gear comprises a rigid circular spline 
having "n" teeth, a flexspline having fewer than "n" teeth 
("n" being a positive integer) and being disposed in the 
circular spline, and a rotatable wave generator disposed in 
the flexspline to deform the flexspline into a lobed configuration, 
such as an oval shape, so as to force the 
flexspline into engagement with the circular spline at two 
points of the major axis of the formed ovaloid. The wave 
generator may include an oval camplate and a bearing snugly 
mounted on the outer periphery of the camplate. The outer 
bearing is matingly inserted into the flexspline so as to 
deform it to the peripheral contour of the camplate. An 
input shaft attached to the camplate provides rotation 
thereof, causing the ovaloid configuration of the flexspline 
to be correspondingly rotated. During such rotation, 
the circular spline is induced to rotate relative to the 
flexspline an amount proportional to the difference in the 
number of teeth between the flexspline and the circular 
spline. When an output shaft is arranged on either the 
flexspline or the circular spline, that output shaft is 
rotated very slowly in comparison to the input shaft and 
camplate. Such harmonic drive strain wave gearing has been 
utilized in machinery requiring a high reduction ratio.  
 An improvement in tooth design was made by Ishikawa, 
as shown in U.S. Patent 3,415,143, wherein tooth engagement 
between the flexspline and the circular spline was 
deviated so that one face only of a flexspline tooth engages 
a circular spline tooth. Further improvements in harmonic drive tooth profiles 
appeared in U.S. Patent 3,996,816 to Brighton who 
designed a modified involute configuration with a small 
contact angle. A more recent attempt at a tooth profile redesign 
is shown in U.S. Patent 4,823,638 to Ishikawa, wherein a 
tooth profile of the engaging splines is defined by a 
transformation of an original curve by the application of a 
reduced 1/2 scale to a corresponding similar figure, that 
is, a mapping curve derived by a similarity transformation 
from the movement locus of the crest of the flexspline 
relative to the
