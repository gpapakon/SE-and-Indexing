<ABSTRACT>
In a system for securing rails (2) on the sole plates of a railway track, bolts (9) are anchored on the one hand to the sleepers (4) and on the other hand they elastically stress a rail foot (2) insulated from the sleeper by intermediate layers by means of insulating wedge rail anchors (8) made of plastic and having a bore for the bolts. Wedge rail anchors may be used which extend over the rail foot and which have a passage composed of two bores (12, 13) inclined with respect to each other. In another embodiment, the material thickness of the wedge anchor rail below the nose (15) that extends over the rail foot is the same both on the side that faces the rail foot and on the side opposite to the rail foot. In yet another embodiment, the sole plates have a support (43) for the wedge rail anchor (8) which is taken out in the area of the bolt for a pre-mounting position. All embodiments of the wedge rail anchor allow the securing system to be pre-mounted on the sleeper, achieving at the same time such a large clearance between the securing elements that a rail may be set on the sleeper without taking out the securing parts. The wedge rail anchor is preferably made of a cold resistant, high modulus, thermoplastic polyurethane and has elements for supporting the wedge rail anchor against an anchoring in the rail. Finally, the wedge rail anchor, the dowel (5) and/or the intermediate layer under the rail foot may have elastic properties that match those of the other cooperating spring elements.

Fastening system for rails on a support sleeper of a 
rail system, in which bolts are anchored at one end on 

the support sleeper and at the other end via insulating 
wedge anchors of plastics, located between a 

horizontally-acting abutment and the edge of a rail foot, 
which have an aperture for the bolt, extend over and 

resiliently brace a rail foot insulated from the support 
sleeper by intermediate layers, characterised in that, in 

order to secure all the rail fastening components in a 
pre-assembly position leaving the rail foot (2) free, the 

aperture (12-14, 33) and the material thickness (20-21) 
are correspondingly adapted to the wedge anchor (8, 18, 

28, 32, 38) or to its shape, and/or a correspondingly 
formed recess (22, 25, 46, 47) is located in the abutment 

(42/43). 
Fastening system according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the aperture in the wedge anchor (8, 32) is made 

up of two bores (12, 13, 33), extending obliquely towards 
one another. 
Fastening system according to claim 1, characterised 
in that when the wedge anchor (18, 28, 38) is provided 

with a cylindrical bore, the material thickness (20, 21), 
measured in the transverse direction of the rail, is of  

 
approximately equal size orthogonally to the axis A, and 

on both sides of the bore beneath the portion (19) 
extending over the rail foot (2). 
Fastening system according to claim 1, especially 
for Y-section steel sleepers, characterised by recesses 

(46, 47) in the rear of the abutment (42, 43) for the 

wedge anchors, into which the bolts (9) bracing the 
oppositely-lying rail foot (2) can be pushed apart after 

slight loosening of the fastening. 
Fastening system according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the anchor wedges (32, 38) are 

supported on their underside in the support sleeper (30, 
4) with parts (34, 39, 65) on an anchorage formed as a 

plug (31, 43). 
Fastening system according to claim 5, characterised 
in that support faces for the wedge anchors in the braced 

condition are located in a plane (O) orthogonal to the 
axis (A) of the bolt (9). 
Fastening system according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the parts of the wedge anchors (32, 

38, 65) supported on the plug (31, 35, 43, 69) have a 
material thickness which is equal to or less than the 

wall thickness of the plug.  
 
Fastening system according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
preferably for a concrete sleeper, characterised in that 

the support sleeper (24) has on a side not facing the 
rail foot (2) a recess (22) for fixing the wedge anchor 

(19) in a pre-assembly position. 
Fastening system according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the wedge anchor is divided into a 

portion (65) exerting the wedge effect and a portion (66) 
engaging over the rail foot (2), and which, in the pre-assembly 

position, is pivoted out of the built-in 
position (Figure 10). 
Fastening system according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised by an intermediate disc (26) loosely 

mounted between the wedge anchor (32, 32a) and the head 
(11) of the bolt (9) or a nut sitting on the bolt. 
Fastening system according to one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that a wedge anchor consisting of 

thermoplastic polyurethane is combined with an 
intermediate layer (3) under the rail foot (2) consisting 

of elastomers with a lesser resilient rigidity. 
Fastening system according to claim 11, 
characterised in that the compressive strength of the  

 
intermediate layer (3) has less than half, preferably 

less than a quarter of the compressive strength of the 
wedge anchor, and the intermediate layer preferably 

consists of an elastomer with a cellular structure. 
Fastening system according to one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised in that the rail foot is held on a support 

sleeper by a respective inner and outer wedge anchor, 
which are offset to one another in the longitudinal 

direction of the rail. 
Fastening system according to one of claims 1 to 13, 
preferably for Y-section steel sleepers, characterised in 

that the sleeper surface has, parallel to and at a 
spacing from the rail foot (2), a plurality of partly 

oblique shoulders (48, 49, 59) for support in the braced 
and pre-assembly position of the wedge anchors (56, 56a, 

61).
