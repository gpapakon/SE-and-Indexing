<ABSTRACT>
Seal labels (19) are affixed to containers (3) by 
means of equipment comprising a system of conveyors 

(14, 16) serving to direct a succession of the 
containers (3) along a predetermined path (13'), 

and a feed device (23) by which gummed labels (19) 
are supplied to a fixing station (25) occupying a 

position alongside one part of the selfsame path 
(13'). The feed device (23) affords a recess (26) 

located between points against which the two ends 
of each label (19) are restrained, and operates in 

conjunction with a first push rod (46) by which 
each container (3) in turn is displaced from the 

conveying path (13'), directed forcibly against a 
relative label (19) supported by the feed device 

(23) and caused to penetrate the recess (26) to a 
given depth together with the label. Thereafter, 

the container (3) is ejected from the recess (26) 
and repositioned on the conveying path (13') by a 

second push rod (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to equipment for the 
application of seal labels to containers as defined in the 
preamble of claim 1. In particular, the present invention relates to 
labelling equipment suitable for use in affixing a 
revenue stamp to the topmost portion of a packet of 
cigarettes. US Patent 4,718,216 discloses an item of equipment 
designed to operate in conjunction with a cigarette 
packaging machine utilizing two wrapping lines, in 
which the packets of cigarettes turned out by each 
line are formed progressively into a vertical stack 
by an elevator driven intermittently with a push-up 
type feed action and stationed next to a relative 
labelling device. Each such device essentially comprises a suction 
roller by which the labels are conveyed singly and 
in succession, held tightly against the peripheral 
face, first toward a gumming device and then to a 
station at which each one is affixed to the bottom 
packet of the stack formed by the elevator.  
 The periphery of each suction roller is furnished 
with a plurality of fork elements capable of radial 
movement in relation to the roller and able also, 
by means of suction and employing the tips of the 
relative prongs, to retain single labels on which 
a coating of adhesive material has been deposited. 
In the process of affixing a label to a packet at 
the bottom of the relative stack, the packets above 
are elevated from the object packet by a distance 
such as will allow one fork element of the roller 
to engage the top of the packet between its prongs. 
Consequently, before a successive packet can be 
brought into the area where the labels are affixed, 
each packet to receive a label in this manner must 
be lifted, together with the stacked packets above, 
by a distance significantly greater than the depth 
of the single packet as measured in the vertical 
stacking direction. This substantial movement also occupies a somewhat 
lengthy interval of time, in order to safeguard the 
packets from mechanical stresses that could result 
in damage, and as a result, significant limitations 
are placed on the operating speed of the equipment 
in question, hence also of the packaging machine as 
a whole.  
 A further drawback of the equipment as disclosed in 
US 4,718,21 derives from the fact that labels are 
folded over the tops of the packets in a position 
whereby a central portion of each label is applied 
to one vertically disposed end face of the packet 
and the two end flaps of the label are attached to 
the two opposite and larger

<CLAIMS>
Equipment for the application of seal labels to 
containers, comprising means (14, 16) by which to 

direct a plurality of containers (3) arranged in 
succession along a conveying path (13'), feed means 

(23) by which labels (19) are supplied to a fixing 
station (25) sited in close proximity to a part of 

the conveying path (13'), also means (24) by which to 
apply an adhesive material to the labels (19), 

wherein the feed means (23) comprise a drum (23) 
rotatable about an axis (29) and furnished 

peripherally with at least one recess (26) extending 
in a substantially radial direction and being coupled 

with a respective retaining device (38) consisting in 
suction means (38) such as will retain a respective 

label (19), and wherein the equipment further 
comprises first pushing means (46) by which a 

single container (3) is displaced from the conveying 
path (13'), directed forcibly against a label (19) 

supported by the feed means (23) and caused to enter 
the recess (26) adjacent to the label (19), at least 

in part, and second pushing means (33) by which the  
 

container (3) is ejected from the recess (26), 
characterized in that 


said respective retaining device (38) operates on the 
periphery of the drum on opposite sides of the recess (26) 

and is able to retain two opposite end portions of a 
respective label (19), and 
the single recess (26) exhibits two opposite faces 
coinciding respectively with the prongs (34) of a 

fork element (35), the fork element (35), being part 
of said second pushing means (33), is capable of 

reciprocating movement in a direction normal to a 
part of the conveying path (13'), and the retaining 

device (38) is positioned alongside the prongs (34) 
of the fork element (35), and 
said second pushing means (33) are able to return the 
container (3) to its former position on the conveying 

path (13'). 
Equipment as in claim 1, wherein the axis (29) of the 
rotatable drum (23) normal to at least one part of 

the conveying path (13').  
 
Equipment as in claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the 
plurality of containers (3) is composed of single 

containers disposed substantially one alongside the 
next, and the conveying path (13') is substantially 

rectilinear.  
 
Equipment as in preceding claims further comprising 
means (41) by which to position and maintain a 

given number of the plurality of containers (3) at 
a predetermined distance from the container (3) 

occupying the station (25) at which the labels (19) 
are affixed.
