<ABSTRACT>
A high-sensitivity Doppler radar module which at the same time has a low transmitted power and harmonic emission is intended to have high ESD resistance and to be of compact construction. A local oscillator (2) which is stabilized using a dielectric resonator (1) supplies a microwave antenna (5) via a series-connected mixer (3, 4). The microwave antenna (5) emits a transmitted signal, and the signal reflected back and received from an object is fed via the antenna (5) to the mixer (3, 4) and is mixed with the element of the oscillator signal used for the mixing process, to form the Doppler signal.
