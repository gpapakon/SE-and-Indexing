<ABSTRACT>
Thermoplastic plastics materials are compounded with an additive comprising 
mono- or di-pentaerythritol and a melamine phosphate (e.g. dimelamine 

phosphate). This enhances the ability of these materials (especially when 
fabricated to make seating components in stadia, theatres etc) to resist 

both direct and radiant heat without excessive evolution of toxic fumes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to flame-retardant and heat-resistant materials, in 
particular to flame-retardant and heat-resistant plastics materials. Plastics materials, especially thermoplastic plastics materials are 
frequently used in applications such as moulded seating components, e.g. for 
seating in stadia, theatres and the like. In a fire situation, many of the 
hitherto - used plastics materials have been found to exacerbate the fire 
either by their inherent flammability or, if not inherently flammable, by 
the evolution of toxic gases under the influence of both direct and radiant 
heat. The present invention is concerned with the ability of thermoplastic 
plastics materials to resist both direct and radiant heat, without the 
evolution of excessive amounts of toxic (e.g. halogenated) fumes. We have now found that certain thermoplastic plastics materials treated 
according to the present invention exhibit intumescence under the action of 
heat, especially radiant heat. A protective char is formed on the outer 
layer, thereby preventing further combustion. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for imparting 
flame-retardant and heat-resistant properties to a thermoplastic plastics 
material, in which the said plastics material is compounded with an additive 
comprising from 10 to 40% by weight mono-or dipentaerythritol and 
correspondingly from 90 to 60% by weight of a melamine phosphate. The present invention also provides a flame-retardant and heat-resistant 
material made by the method described in the immediately preceding 
paragraph. The present invention further provides a fabricated article comprising a 
flame-retardant and heat-resistant material made according to the aforesaid 
method.  The melamine phosphate may, for example, be dimelamine phosphate. Suitably, the additive may comprise from 20 to 25% by weight of the mono-or 
dipentaerythritol and correspondingly from 80 to 75% by weight of the 
melamine phosphate. Typically, the additive may comprise about 22% by weight dipentaerythritol 
and about 78% by weight of melamine phosphate. Preferably, the additive may 
be present relative to the plastics material in a ratio of from 25:75 to 
50:50 by weight. For example, the ratio may be 40:60 by weight. Preferably, the thermoplastic plastics material may consist essentially of 
polypropylene. Alternatively, the thermoplastic plastics material may consist essentially 
of a thermoplastic polyurethane.
 
The materials made according to the present invention may be fabricated by
