<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for protecting individual segments of a 
contiguous I/O address space on a system bus using the page access 

protection resources of a processor operating on a processor bus address 
space. The contiguous I/O address space is segmented and mapped by 

translation into the processor address space by distributing I/O segments 
non-contiguously among successive processor bus pages. Individual I/O 

address space segments, as may be associated with I/O ports, are 
protected directly by the processor through the selective enablement of 

page protection for correspondingly mapped ports.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a computer address space 
protection system. Conventionally available personal computers do not provide 
resources by which an operating system can protect designated address 
space. This lack of selective protection exposes systems having directly 
mapped input/output (I/O) devices to unintended or malicious code 
initiated read or write operations. As the number of I/O devices 
increases, and with multitasking systems and network environments, the 
importance of protecting address space becomes a subject of greater 
concern. Some advanced workstations and computer systems employ RAM based 
techniques to control access into I/O address space. The prevailing 
approach involves the use of a table in memory which is consulted to 
determine whether the code seeking access to the specified address space 
has the requisite authority. This approach provides protection to the 
I/O address space, but is costly in terms of memory and is slow in speed 
as a consequence of the comparisons that must be performed. Advanced processors, such as the PowerPC 601 (trademark of IBM 
Corporation) RISC processor available from IBM Corporation provide 
inherent memory protection resources. For example, in the case of the 
PowerPC 601 processor, the memory management unit provides selectively 
enabled protection to the processor address space enforceable at a block 
or page level. The access protection is selectable in varying options 
including read/write operation or user/supervisor levels. The details of 
the capabilities are described in the PowerPC 601 RISC Microprocessor 
Users Manual MPC 601UM/AD. However, as noted above, the protection is 
invocable at the aforementioned block or page level. The distribution of address space for computer system level 
functions such as I/O are in most cases contiguous. Given the high speed 
of contemporary processors, the I/O devices, memory and other peripherals 
within the processor address space are physically attached to buses which 
are distinct from, but coupled by interface to, the bus upon which the 
processor itself resides. Of those system type buses conventionally in 
use, the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) or Extended Industry 
Standard Architecture (EISA) are the best known. Another well known  
 
system level bus for connecting I/O devices is the Microchannel bus 
(trademark of IBM Corporation). A relatively new bus architecture which 
has drawn significant attention is known as the Peripheral Component 
Interconnect (PCI)
