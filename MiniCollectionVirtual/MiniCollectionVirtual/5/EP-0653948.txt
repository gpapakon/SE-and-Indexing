<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
the destruction of halocarbons. World wide concern over the depletion of ozone in 
the upper atmosphere has led to stringent 
international measures covering the production and use 
of halocarbons, particularly chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs) used in refrigeration, foam blowing, aerosols, 
etc. Intense work in the developed world is being 
targetted towards the search for some "ozone friendly" 
alternative compounds for use in these applications. 
However, considerable quantities of CFCs are presently 
"locked-up" in existing equipment. As this equipment 
comes to the end of its useful life there would be 
great value in being able to extract the CFCs and 
destroy the material in a process which would remove 
the halocarbons from the atmosphere. EP-A-0 099 951 describes a process for treating 
oil which is contaminated with halogenated species 
such as polychlorinated benzene compounds by means of 
sodium finely dispersed in the oil so as to produce 
dehalogenated organic compounds in suspension or as a 
sludge which can be filtered off together with sodium 
chloride. We have now developed a process in which 
halocarbons are converted from materials with a high 
ozone depletion potential into stable solid phase 
compounds. Accordingly, the present invention provides a 
process for the destruction of a halocarbon, which 
process comprises reacting the halocarbon with sodium 
characterised in that the halocarbon in gaseous form 
is bubbled through a bath of molten sodium at a 
temperature in the range from 98° to 500°C to produce  
 
the appropriate sodium halide or halides in the solid 
phase. The reaction of the present invention is 
surprising since it would have been predicted that a 
very violent, if not explosive reaction, would occur 
when the halocarbon contacted the molten sodium. The process of the present invention, although 
specifically designed to address the chlorofluorocarbon 
problem, could also be used to treat a 
wide range of other halocarbons, such as dry cleaning  
 
fluids, degreasing fluids, polychlorobiphenyls, etc. In carrying out the process of the present 
invention, the molten sodium is maintained at a 
temperature in the range of from 98° to 500°C, 
preferably at a temperature in the range of from 
200° to 300°C. The halocarbon which is to be destroyed in the 
present invention may be bubbled through the molten 
sodium, or may be admixed with an inert gas, such as, 
nitrogen, helium or argon. The halocarbon to be treated according
