<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mixing and administration syringe for injectable substances, which comprises a barrel (1) and a plunger (5) which is displaceable therein and rests by a stopper (8) at its distal end tightly against the inner surface of the barrel (1) in order to form an injection volume (30) in the barrel (1). The invention is to achieve enhanced miscibility of solutions, suspensions and the like coupled with minimal loss of active substance. For this, it is provided, according to the invention, that a longitudinally displaceable mixing plunger (20), which projects from the stopper (8) at the proximal end (7) is guided through the plunger (5). At its distal end, the mixing plunger is provided with a mixing piston (16) having at least one opening (18) through the piston surface and through which injectable substances can pass on displacement of the mixing piston (16) in the injection volume (30). Effective mixing of the injectable substances is brought about by moving the mixing piston (16) to and fro in the injection volume. The invention can be applied to simple injection syringes and to double-chamber syringes.

Injection syringe, constructed as a double-chamber syringe,
for mixing and administration of substances for injection,

having

a syringe barrel (1),
a plunger (5) which can be displaced therein, projects
out of the barrel (1) with its proximal end and lies

tightly against the inner surface of the barrel (1)
with a first stopper (8) at its distal end, to form an

injection volume (30) in the syringe barrel (1),
a mixing plunger (22) which is passed through the
plunger (5) such that it can be displaced in the

longitudinal direction, projects out of the plunger
(5) with its proximal end and is provided, on its

distal end, with a mixing piston (16) which has at
least one opening (18) which passes through the piston

surface and through which substance for injection can
pass when the mixing piston (16) is displaced in the

injection volume (30),

characterized in that
a second stopper (40) is arranged between the mixing
piston (16) and the base (2) of the injection barrel

(1) in a manner such that it can be displaced, by
which the injection volume (30) is divided into a

first chamber (30b) for solvent or suspending agent
and into a second chamber (30a) for a substance to be

dissolved or to be suspended, and
the second stopper (40) is provided with a valve means
(61) which is to be opened by mechanical action when

the mixing piston (16) is pushed forwards in the
direction of the second stopper (40), to provide a

flow-through path between the two chambers (30a, 30b).
Injection syringe according to claim 1, characterized in
that the valve means (61) is formed by a tapered pin which

sits in a bore of the second stopper (40) and can be
detached from its seat in the bore of the stopper (40)

under contact pressure on one end facing the mixing piston
(16).
Injection syringe according to claim 2, characterized in
that the tapered pin (61) is provided, on its side facing

the base (2) of the injection barrel (1), with grooves (68)
which keep a flow-through path between the base (2) and

tapered pin (61) free.
Injection syringe according to claim 1, characterized in
that the mixing piston (16) has flexible regions (60) which

can partly evade a contact pressure perpendicular to the
mixing piston surface by bending.
