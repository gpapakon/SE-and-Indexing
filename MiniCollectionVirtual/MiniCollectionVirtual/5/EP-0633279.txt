<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of 
polycarboxylates, more specifically to a novel method for the preparation of 
adducts of alkylene oxide polymers with unsaturated carboxylic acids. The 
invention is of particular value for the manufacture of alkyl or alkenyl 
ether polycarboxylic acid salts, hereinafter collectively referred to as 
"AEPs". The invention also provides novel AEPs which can be prepared by the 
novel method. AEPs have been reported as mild anionic surfactants which are capable of 
sequestering calcium ions, thus being able to act as 'self-building' 
surfactants. However, hitherto, no totally satisfactory method for the preparation of 
AEPs in a commercially acceptable yield, free from by-products, has been 
disclosed. The only known preparative methods typically produce AEPs of 
variable character, which require neutralisation prior to use and which may 
be hydrolytically unstable. In particular, on neutralisation to alkaline 
pH, e.g. 7 or above, they typically form viscous mesophases which often 
undergo phase separation on dilution or which do not produce clear 
solutions. We have discovered that the products hitherto referred to in the 
literature as 'AEPs' are in fact complex mixtures containing from 25 to 50% 
by weight of esters, and numerous undesirable by-products formed by side 
reactions of the ester. Low yields of the unesterified AEP thus result, 
often coupled with unreproducible results due to the complex side reactions 
possible. It has not proved possible to purify or to characterise the 
product by conventional methods. To date the only commercially acceptable surfactants that have been made by 
the known method are based on feedstocks having relatively short alkyl 
chains (e.g. 8 to 12C and having an average less than 11) and high propylene  
 
oxide (.e.g. more than 10% molar of the total alkylene oxide). Such products 
are adapted to a limited range of industrial uses. One such use is the 
levelling of dyes in textile treatment, where the use of AEPs is known (W0 
9100318). It has not proved possible to make acceptable products from 
feedstocks which are more adapted to detergent or toiletry applications, 
such as C₁₂₋₁₄ alcohols. Moreover propylene oxide based polyalkoxylates are 
considered undesirable on environmental grounds because they are less 
biodegradable than ethylene oxide based products. The known technology, 
however, has not been found capable in practice of providing commercially 
viable products based on ethylene
