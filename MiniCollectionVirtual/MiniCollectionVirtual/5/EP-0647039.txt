<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to data communications 
interfaces. Specifically, the invention is directed 
to optically-coupled data communications interfaces. Data line receivers inherently exhibit high impedance. 
Data line drivers, however, present a load on a communications 
line. As a consequence, a communications line 
serving several data line drivers may become unduly loaded 
and develop transmission problems. Electrically isolating 
inactive drivers can reduce the loading on the 
communications line. Optocouplers are one class of devices used to transmit 
signal information between respective circuitry while 
maintaining electrical isolation therebetween. This is 
accomplished since optical signals, and not electrical 
signals, are passed between the light emitters and the 
photodetectors of an optocoupler, which are connected to 
respective portions of the circuitry. The size, cost and 
performance of optocouplers makes these devices ideal to 
implement isolation for data communication lines and 
interfaces. However, optocouplers are usually single-ended or 
unbalanced, and have just two states: high and low. In 
contrast, noise-insensitive data formats are typically  
 
differential, offering a balanced signal with respect to a 
common reference. Further, to provide additional states 
beyond simply high and low, more devices are needed, i.e., 
one device for every two states. It is therefore desirable to have a single channel 
optical interface device that will support differentially-formatted 
data and offer tri-state line termination 
characteristics. It is also desirable to provide an optical 
interface device having transfer characteristics that are 
independent of time, temperature, and variations in the 
efficiency of the optical source. The aforementioned problems are obviated by the 
present invention which provides an optically-coupled 
differential line driver. The driver offers multiple level 
encoding using just a single optical source. The driver may comprise two stages: an input stage, 
which includes a light emitter, such as a light emitting 
diode ("LED"), and an output stage, which includes a light 
receiver. To achieve a three state output, for example, 
the driver employs a multi-level optical modulation 
technique. Also, by using an optical feedback technique, 
the output power of the optical source, such as an LED, can 
be precisely controlled to create multiple optical flux 
levels. The light receiver in the output stage, in turn, 
decodes the multiple optical flux
