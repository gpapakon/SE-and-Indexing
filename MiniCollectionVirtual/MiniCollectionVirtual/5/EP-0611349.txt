A pressure control valve, in particular an electromagnetic 
valve for slip-controlled brake systems for automotive 

vehicles, including a valve-closing member (4) which is 
axially movably guided in a valve housing (17) and which is 

capable of adjusting a passage between a first pressure 
agent connection (2) and at least one second pressure agent 

connection (3) depending on its position that is variable 
with respect to a valve seat (8), including pressure agent 

transition ducts (1, 1') to be shut off or to be opened 
directly one after the other by the valve-closing member (4) 

which are positioned between the first and the second 
pressure agent connections (2, 3) and form a variable 

cross-sectional area of the valve opening, including a first 
pressure chamber (13) and a second pressure chamber (12) 

which are isolated from each other by sealing elements (14) 
and a valve tappet (11) which extends through the sealing 

elements (14),
characterized
 by a bore in a guide element (16) 
for the valve tappet (11) to extend through, the sealing 

elements (14) being arranged so as to be sealed and radially 
movable on the guide element (16), and by a by-pass duct 

(18) which provides pressure balance between the first 
pressure chamber (13) and the second pressure agent 

connection (3). 
A pressure control valve as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the pressure control 
valve is designed as an electromagnetically controllable  

 
proportional valve which variably adjusts the stroke of the 

valve-closing member (4) by a variation of the armature 
current. 
A pressure control valve as claimed in claim 2,
characterized
 in that as a force counteracting 
the force of the magnet armature a spring (7) is arranged 

which is compressed between a magnet core (5) and a magnet 
armature (6). 
A pressure control valve as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the pressure agent 
transition ducts (1, 1') are distributed over a plurality of 

valve stroke sections and are directed toward the 
valve-closing member (4) substantially at right angles to 

the axis of the valve stroke. 
A pressure control valve as claimed in anyone of the 
preceding claims,
characterized
 in that the pressure agent 
transition ducts (1, 1') are positioned in the valve seat 

(8). 
A pressure control valve as claimed in at least anyone of 
the preceding claims,
characterized
 in that a valve-closing member 
(4) being furnished with a plunger piston (9) and with a 

preferably spherical section is guided so as to be abuttable 
against the valve seat (8), the spherical section of the 

valve-closing member (4) having a larger diameter than the  
 

plunger piston (9). 
A pressure control valve as claimed in claim 5,
characterized
 in that the valve seat (8) is 
composed of a first valve seat surface (8') which is flared 

funnel-shape and a cylindrical second slide valve sealing 
surface (8'') which is penetrated by a plurality of pressure 

agent transition ducts (1, 1') being disposed one above the 
other. 
A pressure control valve as claimed in anyone of the 
preceding claims 1 to 4,
characterized
 in that the pressure agent 
transition ducts (1, 1') are positioned in a separate valve 

supporting element (10) which is arranged in series with 
respect to the valve seat (8). 
A pressure control valve as claimed in anyone of the claims 
1 to 8,
characterized
 in that the pressure agent 
transition ducts (1, 1') are furnished with orifices and/or 

restrictors.
