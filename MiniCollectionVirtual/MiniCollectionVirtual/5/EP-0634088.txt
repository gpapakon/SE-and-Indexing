<ABSTRACT>
Combined harvester with a cutting unit mounted at the front and consisting of two pivotable cutting-unit halves (1a, 1b), and with a single drive for the two cutter parts which are assigned to each cutting-unit half and which are connected operatively by means of a transmission device. The transmission device consists of two identically designed two-armed oscillating levers (11, 12) pivotable in synchronism about a central axis, each oscillating lever being mounted on one cutting-unit half and the two oscillating levers having end rolling faces (23, 24), the mutually confronting rolling faces of the two oscillating levers being constantly in contact with one another.

<CLAIMS>
A harvester having a cutting mechanism which is attached at the 
front or laterally and which has a cutting mechanism tray and a blade (4) 

comprising two blade portions (4a, 4b) which are associated with the 
cutting mechanism halves and which are reciprocably and synchronously 

drivable by means of a single lateral blade drive (5) and a transmission 
device (6) arranged in the region of the separation location, characterised 

in that the transmission device (6) has two pivotal levers (11, 12) which 
are in the form of double-armed levers and which are freely rotatably 

mounted in the central region on mounting pins (13, 14) which are disposed 
vertically and at a spacing relative to the plane of movement of the blade 

portions (4a, 4b), that fixedly arranged in each blade portion (4a, 4b) at 
a relatively small spacing relative to the separation location is an 

upstanding projection (18, 19) which engages into a slot (20, 21) in the 
associated pivotal lever (11, 12), and that the mutually facing surfaces 

(23, 24) of the pivotal levers (11, 12), in both end regions, are in the 
form of rolling surfaces which are always in contact with each other. 
A combine harvester according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the pivotal levers (11, 12) are of identical construction and that their 

pivot points are on a transverse axis which circles the axis of symmetry. 
A combine harvester according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the spacing of the mounting pins (13, 14) is the same as the spacing of the 

upstanding projections (18, 19) of the blade portions (4a and 4b). 
A combine harvester according to claim 1 characterised in that 
th
e mutually oppositely disposed end regions of each pivotal lever (11, 12) 
are of an arcuate configuration at the facing corner regions to form the 

rolling surfaces (23, 24), wherein the inside surfaces which are between 
the rolling surfaces are displaced in a direction to the mounting pins (13, 

14).  
 
A combine harvester according to claims 1 to 4 characterised in 
that the mutually contacting rolling surfaces (23, 24) of the pair of 

pivotal levers (11, 12) are treated to make them abrasion-resistant. 
A combine harvester according to claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that at their contact ends the pair of pivotal levers (11, 12) is provided 

with radial bearings (25), the outer race surfaces of which form the 
rolling surfaces. 
A combine harvester according to claim 4 characterised in that 
the mutually remote outer surfaces of the pivotal levers (11, 12) are of a 

straight configuration. 
A combine harvester according to one or more of the preceding 
claims characterised in that the slots (20, 21) in the end regions of the 

pivotal levers (11 and 12) extend over a predetermined depth and are open 
downwardly.
