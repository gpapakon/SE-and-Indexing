<ABSTRACT>
A device for connecting a user to a source of medical 
gas, such as for example oxygen, or a vacuum source, comprises 

a connecting box (1) which can be permanently connected to the 
source, and a connecting element (3) which can be detachably 

coupled with the connecting box (1) and can be permanently 
connected with the user. The connecting element can be coupled 

with the connecting box (1) in a parking position and in a working 
position, wherein the user is connected to the source in the 

working position only. The device is provided with an 
indication means (6) for indicating the position of the connecting 

element (3) in the connection box (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device in accordance with 
the preamble of appended claim 1. A device of this kind is known from DE-A-1 943 552. 
According to this document the connecting box, for example a 
wall connecting box, is connected with a line system provided 
in a hospital. The advantage of such a device is that the connecting 
element is connected with the connecting box in the 
parking position, however, there is not yet provided a connection 
between the user and the gas source. By a small movement 
from the parking position into the working position a closing 
valve generally accommodated in the connecting box, is opened 
whereby the user is connected with the gas source. In the 
known device a problem arises as it cannot be observed well 
from some distance whether the connecting element is located 
in the parking position or the working position, whereby undesired 
situations may occur. The displacement of the connecting 
element from the working position into the parking position is 
only approximately 3 mm. A displacement of this small size is 
not suitable for reliable indication purposes and, moreover, 
the displacement can only be observed from the side. The invention aims to provide a simple and efficient 
solution for this problem. To this end the device according to the invention is 
characterized in accordance with the characterizing portion of 
claim 1. The invention thus relates to a connecting device 
which has been provided with a coloured indication means which 
is three-dimensionally shaped and therefore may be observed 
from any side to observe the presence of the colour. The device 
is suitable for use in hospital or operating theatre environments, 
provides excellent three-dimensional indication, 
which is directly related to whichever of the working or parking 
positions is occupied and is mechanically and reliably  
 
operated by completely automatic means. Even a small axial 
displacement results in a well observable indication. Advantageous embodiments of the invention are defined 
in the depending claims 2 - 5.  
 The invention will be further explained by reference 
to the drawings in which an embodiment is schematically shown. Fig. 1 is a schematical side view partially shown in 
cross section of an embodiment of the device according to the 
invention, wherein the connecting element is located in the 
parking position. Fig. 2 is a side view of the device of Fig. 1 
partially shown in cross section, wherein the connecting 
element is located in the working position.

<CLAIMS>
Device for connecting a user to a source of 
medical gas, such as for example oxygen, or a vacuum source, 

comprising a connecting box (1) which can be permanently connected 
to the source, and a connecting element (3) which can 

be detachably coupled with the connecting box and can be 
permanently connected with the user, wherein the connecting 

element can be coupled with the connecting box in a parking 
position and in a working position, wherein the user is 

connected to the source in the working position only, and 
wherein an indication means (7, 8, 10) indicates the position 

of the connecting element (3) in the connection box (1), 
characterized
 
in that the indicating means (7, 8, 10) comprises a 

window (10) in which a colour indication is visible, which 
indicating means comprises a pin (7) slidably mounted in the 

connecting element (3), said pin having a coloured head (8) 
pressed by a spring (9) away from the window (10) and moved 

towards the window against the action of the spring 
during movement from the parking position into the working 

position, and in that the window (10) is shaped three-dimensionally, 
the head (8) of the pin (7) lying fully within the 

three-dimensional window in the working position. 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the pin (
7) with its end opposite of the head (8) projects out 
of the connecting element (3) and cooperates with said end 

with the connecting box (1). 
Device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that 
the indication means (7, 8, 10) is provided in the connecting 

element (3) . 
Device according to claim 1 or 3, 
characterized
 in 
that the indicating means (7, 8, 10) is actuated by the movement 

of the connecting element (3) from the parking position 
into the working position.  

 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in 
that the indicating means (7, 8, 10) is actuated by the gas 

pressure.
