<ABSTRACT>
Described are fibres containing polyacrylonitrile homopolymer or copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of less than 210,000 as fibre-forming substance, said fibres having tenacities of more than 80 cN/tex, initial moduli, based on 100 % extension, of more than 1,800 cN/tex and breaking extensions of less than 10 %. Also described is a process for producing high strength polyacrylonitrile fibres, comprising the following measures:   a) preparing a spinning solution containing an organic aprotic solvent or a mixture of such solvents and at least 15 % by weight, based on the spinning solution, of a polyacrylonitrile homopolymer or copolymer having a weight average molecular weight of less than 500,000 or a mixture of such polymers, b) spinning this spinning solution by a wet spinning process or by a dry jet wet spinning process into a coagulation bath at an extrusion speed of at least 5 m/min, c) coagulating the spun filaments in the coagulation bath and withdrawing these filaments from the coagulation bath, and d) aftertreating the spun filaments by performing one or more drawing steps, the draw ratio between the device for withdrawing the spun filaments from the coagulation bath and the point of exit from the aftertreatment zone being at least 1 : 12.
