<ABSTRACT>
A photosensitive material processing apparatus for processing 
a photosensitive material (P) such as a photographic film and a 

photographic print in use with a solid processing agent (J). The 
apparatus includes: a processing tank (3) for processing the 

photosensitive material (P); a processing agent accommodating 
chamber (4) for accommodating the solid processing agent; a pump (2) 

for circulating a processing solution between the processing 
tank (3) and the processing agent accommodating chamber (4); and a 

processing agent supply means (10) for supplying the solid 
processing agent to the processing agent accommodating 

chamber (4). The processing agent accommodating chamber (4) includes a 
processing agent dissolving member (4A) which further includes a 

processing agent support member (5) for supporting the solid 
processing agent (J). A sectional area of the processing agent 

support member is increased as it comes to a lower portion of 
the processing agent supporting member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a photosensitive 
material processing apparatus, and more particularly relates 
to a photosensitive material processing apparatus for 
processing color films or color prints in which a solid 
processing agent is used for replenishing the processing 
agent. As a means for making an automatic developing apparatus 
compact and also as a means for maintaining the environment to 
be clean and for saving natural resources by reducing an 
amount of use of plastic containers, techniques are disclosed, 
by which a processing agent for replenishment is condensed and 
solidified. For example, the technique is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection No. 5-107712. However, when a solid processing agent for replenishment 
is used, several problems may be encountered, and one of the  
 
problems is that the concentration of a processing solution 
can not be stabilized. In the case of a liquid processing 
agent for replenishment, the processing agent added into a 
processing tank is mixed with the existing processing solution 
when the processing agent is sent into a circulation passage. 
Therefore, the concentration can be made uniform in a short 
period of time, so that the concentration of the processing 
solution can be stabilized. On the other hand, in the case of 
a solid processing agent for replenishment, the processing 
agent charged into the processing solution is gradually 
dissolved. Therefore, the concentration of the processing 
solution is changed until the dissolution is completed. For 
this reason, the solid processing agent is disadvantageous in 
that the processing performance is difficult to be stabilized. 
Further, when the dissolution time is longer than the minimum 
time of the charging interval of the processing agent for 
replenishment, the solid processing agent for replenishment is 
accumulated in the processing tank. The present invention has been achieved to solve the 
above problems. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a photosensitive material processing apparatus 
characterized in that: a contact surface formed between a 
solid processing agent for replenishment and a member for 
holding the solid processing agent is reduced and placed in a  
 
flow of the processing solution so that the dissolution of the 
solid processing agent for replenishment is facilitated, and 
the quality of photosensitive material processing is 
stabilized. The above object can be stabilized by the following 
means. That is, the
