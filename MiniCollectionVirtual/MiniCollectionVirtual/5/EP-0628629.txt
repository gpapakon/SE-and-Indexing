<ABSTRACT>
The process for the production and extraction of thermostable superoxide dismutases consists   a) in culturing, in the temperature range from 40@C to 80@C, in an enclosed photoreactor made of material which is transparent to light and thermally resistant within the said range, aerobic photosynthetic thermophilic micro organisms which are oxygen producers and which have exponential growth within the said range, these micro organisms being suspended in a culture medium and being chosen from microalgae and cyanobacteria and b) in extracting the freshly produced thermostable superoxide dismutases from the culture medium by cell milling (4), ultrafiltration (10) and selective precipitation (12).
