<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an optical fiber fixing member
11 which includes an optical fiber engaging portion 15 for

positioning/engaging an optical fiber F. The optical fiber
engaging portion 15 is provided with two inclined faces 12

for supporting a side wall of the optical fiber when the
optical fiber F is engaged in the optical fiber engaging

portion 15, and a bottom face 13 positioned between the
inclined faces 12. The bottom face 13 is flat.

Additionally, in a sectional face perpendicular to an
optical axis of the optical fiber F supported by the

inclined faces 12, in a boundary portion in which the
bottom face 13 and the inclined faces 12 are connected,

inclinations of the bottom face 13 and the inclined faces
12 are discontinuous. Therefore, when the optical fiber

engaging portion 15 is observed while a light is radiated
to the bottom face 13 from above or from below, contrast of

the bottom face 13 and the inclined face 12 by a reflected
light or a transmitted light is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority rights of
Japanese Patent Application Nos. Hei 9-253053 filed on
September 18, 1997 and Hei 10-252454 filed on September 7,
1998, entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by
reference.The present invention relates to an optical fiber
fixing member for positioning/engaging optical fiber end
portions, an optical fiber array in which the optical fiber
end portions are positioned/fixed, an optical waveguide
module, and a method of measuring dimensional accuracy of
the optical fiber fixing member.An optical fiber fixing member is used in a member
for positioning/fixing light input/output ends of optical
fibers with high accuracy. Such optical fiber fixing
member is disclosed as a substrate for fixing the optical
fiber, for example, in Japanese Patent Application Laidopen
No. 292332/1996 (hereinafter referred to as the
publication). Fixing grooves for receiving and positioning 
the optical fibers are formed in a surface of the board by
press molding. Each fixing groove has a V-shaped sectional
configuration, and its bottom face is pointed or flat. The
publication further discloses an optical fiber array in
which the optical fibers are contained in the fixing
grooves and pressed with a lid.After the optical fiber fixing member is prepared
by grinding processing, press molding, or another method,
it needs to be examined whether optical fiber engaging
portions for positioning/engaging optical fiber end
portions are formed within a predetermined accuracy. For
example, in a case where a plurality of optical fibers are
positioned/engaged and aligned, if the accuracy in pitch of
the optical fiber engaging portions is not within the
predetermined range, they cannot be in an optical fiber
array in which a low optical connection loss is demanded.
Examples of a conventional method of measuring a pitch
dimensional accuracy include an optical measuring method in
which the accuracy is measured from an image with a
measuring microscope or the like, and a stylus type
measuring method in which a configuration measuring device
using a stylus is employed.
(1) In a case where the pitch dimension of each
optical fiber engaging portion is measured from an image
with a measuring microscope or the like, for example, a
method of measuring a pitch or the like between centers of
bottom faces of adjoining optical fiber engaging portions 
can be used.
However, if the bottom face of the optical fiber
engaging portion is pointed as disclosed in the publication,
it is difficult to obtain
