<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heating apparatus,
which uses regenerative burner units including at least
a pair of regenerative burner units having a fuel
injection nozzle and a heat regenerator provided for a
combustion air supply path.The apparatus employs such an alternative change-over
combustion system that one regenerative burner
unit is supplied with fuel through a fuel shut-off
valve and a fuel change-over valve, and supplied with
combustion air through a supply and exhaust change-over
valve to carry out combustion operation, while the
other regenerative burner unit is operated for heat
regeneration by passing a combustion waste gas. The
invention also relates to an operating method of such a
heating apparatus.A heating apparatus of this type is well known in
the art (See Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2-254210)
and can be used to carry out exhaust heat recovery,
resulting in enhancement of thermal efficiency.EP 0 322 678 discloses a regenerative burner system
comprising two burners which are alternatively fired.
Each burner has an air and fuel supply which traverse
separate heat exchangers. Hot gases exhausted from one
burner during firing traverse the heat exhanger
associated with the other burner to provide the inlet
mixture to the other burner with heat. This document
does not, however, provide a convenient means of
linking the fuel change-over valve and the supply and
exhaust change-over valves to each burner.WO 86/05865 also relates to a furnace heating
arrangement which incorporates a regenerative
arrangement. In this disclosure a hot exhaust stream 
and an induction stream to be fed to a furnace are
alternatively fed through a heat-retentive matrix to
effect heat transfer. This disclosure relates only to
a single furnace and does not therefore address the
difficulties of coupling two or more burner
arrangements to effect efficient heat transfer.It is an object of the present invention to ensure
combustion stability of a heating apparatus including
one regenerative burner unit for combustion operation
and another regenerative burner unit for regenerative
operation by relatively simple means.Using the heating apparatus of the present
invention, it is possible to greatly enhance thermal
efficiency of the heating apparatus. In addition, it
is possible to prevent a thermally damageable member
from being exposed to a hot combustion waste gas.According to the present invention, there is
provided a heating apparatus using regenerative burner
units including at least a pair of regenerative burner
uni
