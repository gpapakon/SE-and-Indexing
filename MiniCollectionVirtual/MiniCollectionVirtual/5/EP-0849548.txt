<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorption
refrigerating/heating apparatus or airconditioner and particularly, an
absorption refrigerating/heating apparatus for heating at high efficiency
with a heat pump in an ordinary heating mode and, when the outside air
temperature is too low to pump up heat, shifting to a direct flame heating
mode to maintain the heating capacity to a desired level as well as
permitting simple switchover between the refrigerating mode, the
thermodynamic heating mode, and the direct flame heating mode.Also, the present invention is directed towards an absorption
refrigerating/heating apparatus which improves the start of shifting from
the direct flame heating mode to the thermodynamic heating mode.As absorption type refrigerating apparatuses have commonly
been used for only refrigerating, they are now arranged for not only
refrigerating action but also carrying out a thermodynamic heating action
in which heat pumped up by the absorber is used for heating. In such a
thermodynamic heating action, however, the efficiency of pumping up heat
from the outside air is declined when the temperature of the outside air
drops. A modification is provided for shifting from the thermodynamic
heating action to the direct flame heating mode when the outside air
temperature drops to some lower limit.Disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Nos. Hei 1-47714 and 
Hei 7-96977 and Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication No. Hei 6-2980
are such a modified absorption heat-pump apparatus and a
refrigerating/heating apparatus. An absorption refrigerating/heating
apparatus which performs in any of three modes; refrigerating,
thermodynamic heating, and direct flame heating is depicted in Japanese
Patent Publication No. Hei 6-97127.Those conventional absorption refrigerating/heating apparatuses
of air-cooling type are complicated in the construction where switching is
needed from refrigerating mode to heating mode and vice versa and will
thus hardly be feasible in practice.For example, to shift between the refrigerating mode and the
thermodynamic heating mode in the apparatus disclosed in the Patent
Publication No. Hei 6-97127, the passage for a refrigerant or an absorbent
solution has to be switched. This causes undesired mixture of the
absorbent solution with the refrigerant. For implementation, therefore,
the switching between the three modes of cooling, thermodynamic
heating, and direct flame heating can only be realized with the use of
intricate mechanisms. Although the apparatus disclosed in the
