<ABSTRACT>
The plant for reclaiming waste concrete, sand and similar suspensions is provided with a washing-out device 1 which has a transport spiral 2 which is arranged in a water counterflow and is arranged on a rotor 3 with a driven horizontal shaft 4, there being arranged on one side of the washing-out device 1 a material feed 5 and on the other side a rewashing chamber 6 with one or more bucket wheels 7 and also a discharge device 8, and the drive 17 of the shaft 4 being situated on the discharge side. The horizontal shaft 4 is extended to the material feed 5 and drives a material intake arrangement 26 which brings about a material supply to the material feed 5. Provided as material intake arrangement 26 is a scooping wheel which reaches into a recess 32 of the bottom 40 and on the circumference of which scooping buckets 31 and scraping buckets 34 are arranged, which are mounted displaceably and pivotably radially to the scooping edge 26.

Facility for reprocessing waste concrete, sand and similar 
suspensions using a washing-out apparatus (1) having a spiral 

conveyor (2) which is disposed in a water countercurrent and 
arranged on a rotor (3) with driven horizontal shaft (4), a 

material feed (5) being provided on one side of the washing-out 

apparatus (1) and a rewashing chamber (6) with one or more bucket 
wheels (7) and also a discharging apparatus (8) being provided 

on the other side of the washing-out apparatus (1), and the drive 
(17) of the shaft (4) being situated on the discharging side, the 

horizontal shaft (4) being extended to the material feed (5) and 
driving a material-charging means (26) which effects material 

conveyance to the material feed (5), characterised in that as 
material-charging means (26) there is provided a scoop wheel (26) 

which charges the materials to be washed out, such as gravel, 
sand and dirty water or wash water into the washing-out machine, 

in that scooping buckets (31) and scraping buckets (34) are 
arranged at the periphery of the scoop wheel (26), which reaches 

into a depression (32) in the ground (40), the scooping buckets 
and scraping buckets being fitted to be displaceable (35) 

radially with respect to the scoop wheel (26) and to be pivotable 
(36). 
Facility according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
scoop wheel (26) is mounted on a displaceable additional shaft 

(39) arranged at a distance from the horizontal shaft (4) and can 
be driven by the main shaft (4) via a transmission (38). 
Facility according to Claim 1 and 2, characterised in that 
a ground trough (27) is arranged in the depression (32) in the 

ground (40). 
Facility according to Claim 1 to 3, characterised in that 
the scoop wheel (26) rotates, above the ground (40), in a closed  

 
hood (29). 
Facility according to Claim 1 to 4, characterised in that 
resiliently sprung strips (28) and plastic shovels (33) are 

provided at the periphery of the scoop wheel (26). 
Facility according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that a discharging means (50) with a larger bucket wheel (53) 

than the washing-out machine (1) and the bucket elevator (7) is 
mounted onto the end, for discharging purposes, which discharging 

means makes it possible to raise the throwing-off point (52) and 
thus provides a larger storage area (56) for the washed-out 

material, a further raising of the delivery being achieved by an 
additional shaft (54) being constructed and the chain drive (51) 

being connected to the main shaft (4), and in that, on the other 
side, a material-charging means (26) which makes it possible to 

introduce the material which is to be washed out and is below 
ground level (40) is constructed on the main shaft (4). 
Facility according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that a vibrating conveyor trough (8) or an ascending vibrating 

drainage trough are arranged at the throwing-off point (52). 
Facility according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the outermost bucket wheel (53) may be equipped with an 

independent drive (55).
