<ABSTRACT>
A continuous cell charger including a cell 
insertion chamber into which discharged cells are 

inserted from the exterior; a charging chamber whose 
inlet side is in communication with the cell insertion 

chamber and which has a space extending in a 
predetermined direction; plural pairs of plus and minus 

electrodes, the plus electrodes and the minus electrodes 
being each arranged in a row in the said predetermined 

direction within the charging chamber at intervals equal 
to the diameter of each cell and also functioning to 

guide the cells movably; a charging circuit for 
supplying a charging voltage to the electrodes; a lever 

for pushing a cell which has been inserted into the cell 
insertion chamber, thereby allowing the cell to move to 

the position between the first plus and minus electrodes 
in the charging chamber, and for moving cells already 

received between the plus and minus electrodes in the 
charging chamber also in the said predetermined 

direction by a distance corresponding to one cell; and a 
charged cell accommodating chamber which is in 

communication with an outlet side of the charging 
chamber and which receives therein the cells transferred  

 
from the charging chamber. According to this 

construction, all that is required for the user is 
merely inserting a discharged cell into the cell charger 

and performing the operation for actuating the lever.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a continuous cell 
charger for continuously charging a plurality of 
chargeable dry cells such as chargeable alkaline 
manganese dioxide cells. Heretofore, charging of cells have been conducted 
by inserting a predetermined number of cells into a 
charger and taking them out after the lapse of a 
predetermined time. Thus, since it is necessary to use 
the charger in a conscious manner in point of both 
quantity and time, how to use the charger has been 
troublesome. US-A-4 237 409 discloses a continuous battery 
charger having the features in the preamble of claim 1. It is a first object of the present invention to 
provide a continuous cell charger which is easy to use 
and which permits charged cells to be taken out any 
time.  
 It is a second object of the present invention to 
provide a continuous cell charger capable of 
facilitating the removal of cells after charging. In one aspect of the present invention there is 
provided a continuous cell charger including a cell 
insertion chamber into which discharged cells are 
inserted from the exterior; a charging chamber whose 
inlet side is in communication with the cell insertion 
chamber and which has a space extending in a 
predetermined direction; plural pairs of plus and minus 
electrodes, the plus electrodes and the minus electrodes 
being each arranged in a row in the said predetermined 
direction within the charging chamber at intervals equal 
to the diameter of each cell and also functioning to 
guide the cells movably; a charging circuit for 
supplying a charging voltage to those electrodes; a 
lever for pushing a cell which has been inserted into 
the cell insertion chamber, thereby allowing the cell to 
move to the position between the first plus and minus 
electrodes in the charging chamber, and for moving cells 
already received between the plus and minus electrodes 
in the charging chamber also in the predetermined 
direction by a distance corresponding to one cell; and a 
charged cell accommodating chamber which is in  
 
communication with an outlet side of the charging 
chamber and which receives therein the cells transferred 
from the charging chamber. According to this 
construction, all that is required for the user is only 
insertion of discharged cells and making operation for 
pushing the lever. Consequently, it is possible to 
simplify the way of using the charger. Moreover, since 
the cells after charging are received within the charged 
cell accommodating chamber, it is possible to take out

<CLAIMS>
A continuous cell charger including: 

a charging chamber (11,35) which 
has a space extending in a predetermined direction; 
plural pairs of plus and minus electrodes (12,13,36,37), said 
plus electrodes (12,36) and said minus electrodes (13,37) being each 

arranged in a row in said predetermined direction within 
said charging chamber (11,35) at intervals equal to the diameter 

of each cell (9,27) and also functioning to guide the cells (9,27) 
movably; 
a charging circuit (15,40) for supplying a charging voltage 
to said electrodes; 
 
CHARACTERISED BY: 


a cell insertion chamber (5, 25) into which discharged 
cells are inserted from the exterior, 

the inlet side of the charging chamber (11,35) being 
in communication with the cell insertion chamber (5,25); 
a lever (6,26) for pushing a cell (9,27) which has been inserted 
into said cell insertion chamber (5,25), thereby allowing the 

cell (9,27) to move to the position between the first plus and 
minus electrodes (12,13,36,37) in said charging chamber (11,35), and for 

moving cells (9,27) already received between the plus and minus 
electrodes (12,13,36,37) in the charging chamber (11,35) also in said 

predetermined direction by a distance corresponding to 
one cell (9,27); and  

 
a charged cell accommodating chamber (18,29) which is in 
communication with an outlet side of said charging 

chamber (11,35) and which receives therein the cells (9,27) transferred 
from the charging chamber (11,35). 
A continuous cell charger according to Claim 1, 
wherein said space of said charging chamber (11,35) extends in 

the vertical direction. 
A continuous cell charger according to Claim 2, 
wherein said lever (6,26) has a depressing part (6a,26a) formed at the 

front end thereof for depressing the cell (9,27) in said cell 
insertion chamber (5,25) when the lever (6,26) is actuated with an 

operating force. 
A continuous cell charger according to Claim 1, 
further including a rotary drawer (30) disposed in said 

charged cell accommodating chamber (29) rotatably between a 
closed position and an open position so that in the 

closed position the rotary drawer (30) is stowed within the 
charged cell accommodating chamber (29) to receive through an 

opening portion (42) thereof the cells (27) transferred from said 
charging chamber (35), while in the open position said 

opening portion (42) is exposed to the exterior to permit the 
charged cells (27) to be taken out through the opening 

portion (42).  
 
A continuous cell charger according to Claim 4, 
wherein said rotary drawer (30) has a knob (43) for effecting its 

rotating motion. 
A continuous cell charger according to Claim 2,
