<ABSTRACT>
Data can be processed in table form, it being possible to select freely between combined textual and/or graphic representation of the data. Vertical paging through the data range and horizontal paging through the column and component range of the data is possible by means of control instruments independently of the form in which the data are currently represented. In spite of the graphic representation, any number of data (records) can be processed. The values of the data can be changed by direct manipulation in the graphic representation.
