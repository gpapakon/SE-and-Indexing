<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) by heterogeneously catalysed oxidation in the gas phase by means of a gas containing molecular oxygen, characterised in that the substances which are oxidised are benzaldehydes which are 2,4,5-trialkylated with C1- to C3-alkyl groups or mixtures of benzaldehydes which are 2,4,5-trialkylated with C1- to C3-alkyl groups and benzenes which are 1,2,4,5-tetralkylated with C1- to C3-alkyl groups, in the presence of a catalyst which contains, as active components, 5 to 95 % by weight of one or more transition metal oxides of sub-group IV of the Periodic Table, 1 to 50 % by weight of one or more transition metal oxides of sub-group V of the Periodic Table, 0 to 10 % by weight of one or more oxides of elements of main group I of the Periodic Table and/or 0 to 50 % by weight of one or more oxides of elements of main groups III, IV and V of the Periodic Table and of elements of sub-groups VI and VII of the Periodic Table, and the percentages in each case being based on the total weight of the active components and totalling 100 % by weight.

Process for preparing pyromellitic dianhydride 
(PMDA) by heterogeneously catalysed oxidation in the gas 

phase by means of a gas containing molecular oxygen at a 
temperature of from 250 to 600°C, characterized in that 

benzaldehydes which are 2,4,5-trialkylated by C₁- to C₃-alkyl 
groups or mixtures of benzaldehydes which are 

2,4,5-trialkylated by C₁- to C₃-alkyl groups and benzenes 
which are 1,2,4,5-tetraalkylated by C₁- to C₃-alkyl 

groups in a ratio of from 10:1 to 1:10 are oxidized in 
the presence of a catalyst which contains as active 

components from 5 to 95 % by weight of one or more 
transition-metal oxides of sub-group IV of the Periodic 

Table of the Elements, from 1 to 50 % by weight of one or 
more transition-metal oxides of sub-group V of the 

Periodic Table of the Elements, from 0 to 10 % by weight 
of one or more oxides of elements of main group I of the 

Periodic Table of the Elements and/or from 0 to 50 % by 
weight of one or more oxides of elements of main groups 

III, IV and V of the Periodic Table of the Elements and 
of elements of sub-groups VI and VII of the Periodic 

Table of the Elements, where the indicated percentages by 
weight are based in each case on the total weight of the 

active components and add to 100 % by weight. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in

in that the oxidation is carried out in a fixed-bed 

reactor with air at space velocities of from 800 to 8000 
h⁻¹, a mixing ratio of from 10 to 100 g of starting 

material/Nm³ and a reaction temperature of from 250 to 
600°C, and the pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) is isolated 

from the reaction gas by desublimation in a downstream 
separator or by corresponding gas scrubbing with 

a suitable solvent. 
Process according to any of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the active components contained are  

 
from 5 to 95 % by weight of one or more transition-metal

transition-metal oxides of sub-group V of the Periodic 
Table of the Elements, from 0 to 10 % by weight of one or 

more oxides of elements of main group I of the Periodic 
Table of the Elements and/or from 0 to 50 % by weight of

V of the Periodic Table of the Elements and of elements 

of sub-groups VI and VII of the Periodic Table of the 
Elements. 
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in

omponents contained are from 10 to 90 % 
by weight of an oxide of titanium and/or zirconium, from
