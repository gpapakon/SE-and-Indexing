<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to the use of substances inhibiting 
proteic ADP-ribosilation and of their soluble salts and complexes as 

active substances for the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions 
suitable to prevent the diabetes mellitus complications as 

neuropathies, nephropathies, retinopathies, macroangiopathies, 
microangiopathies and hepatopathies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The diabetes mellitus is a well known syndrome characterized by 
hyperglycemia, glycosuria, polyuria and polydipsia and by a series 
of serious complications as neuropathies, nephropathies, 
retinopathies, macroangiopathies, microangiopathies and metabolic 
alterations to the hepatic level. The diabetes mellitus therapy is based on the diet and on the 
treatment by insulin and by oral hypoglycemizing drugs (L. S. 
Goodman and A. Gilman, The Pharmac. Basis of Therapeutics, third 
edition, page 1600). However, the therapeutical results, even allowing to restrain the 
glycemia, are often unsatisfactory as far as the complications 
prevention. On the other side it is known that in some pathologies the proteic 
ADP-ribosilation process is stimulated. In particular this process 
is stimulated by the cholera and the whooping-cough toxins as 
reported for example by R.S. Duman in J. of Neuroch. 57.6, pagg. 
2124-2132, 1991. Moreover, some further endogenous substances able to promote the 
proteic ADP-ribosilation as for example the NADPH, the arginine, the 
nitrogen monoxide and the corticosteroids are known (Stamler et 
al., Nature, pag. 1898-1902, vol. 258, Dec. 18,1992). In addition a lot of substances able to inhibit the proteic ADP-ribosilation 
are known, as it is shown for example by M. Banasik et  
 
al. in J. Biol Chem. 267,3, January 25, 1992, pag. 1569-1575. We have found and constitutes the main object of the present 
invention, that the substances inhibiting the proteic ADP-ribosilation, 
and their soluble salts and complexes may be 
successfully used as active substances for preparing pharmaceutical 
compositions suitable to prevent the diabetes mellitus 
complications. In particular said pharmaceutical compositions are effective in 
preventing the neuropathies, the nephropathies, the retinopathies, 
the macroangiopathies, the microangiopathies and the hepatopathies 
following the diabetes mellitus. Therefore the present invention refers also to the therapeutical 
method for preventing said complications consisting in administering 
the present invention compositions to the patients suffering from 
diabetes mellitus. The characteristics and the advantages of the use of the substances 
inhibiting proteic ADP-ribosilation, their soluble salts and their 
complexes for preparing pharmaceutical compositions suitable to 
prevent the diabetes mellitus complications, will he more evident 
during the following detailed description. Suitable substances to be used according to the present invention 
are, for
