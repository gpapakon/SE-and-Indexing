<ABSTRACT>
A positioner facilitates docking and undocking 
of an electronic test head with a device handler. The 

position provides for rotation of the test head about a 
first axis. The positioner includes a scissor arm 

structure for moving the test head along a second axis 
orthogonal to the first axis

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of art of
electronic test head positioners.In the automatic testing of integrated circuits
(IC) and other electronic devices, special device
handlers have been used which brings the device to the
proper temperature and places the device to be tested in
position. The electronic testing itself is provided by a
large and expensive automatic testing system which 
includes a test head which has been required to connect
to and dock with the device handler. In such testing
systems, the test head has usually been very heavy - on
the order of 40 to 300 kilograms. The reason for this
heaviness is that the test head uses precision high
frequency control and data signals so that the electronic
circuits may be located as close as possible to the
device under test. Accordingly, the test head has been
densely packaged with electronic circuits in order to
achieve the accurate high speed testing of the
sophisticated devices.Test head positioner systems may be used to
position the test head with respect to the device
handler. When the test head is accurately in position
with respect to the device handler, the test head and the
device handler are said to be aligned. When the test
head and device handler are aligned, the fragile test
head and device handler electrical connectors can be
brought together (i.e. docked), enabling the transfer of
test signals between the test head and the device
handler. Prior to docking, the fragile test head and
device handler electrical connectors must be precisely
aligned to avoid damaging the fragile electrical
connectors.A positioner, able to move along a support
structure, carries the teat head to the desired location 
at which the test head is positioned to connect to and
dock with the device handler. The test head is attached
to the positioners so that the test head can achieve six
degrees of freedom (X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z).Test heads, and their respective positioners,
are often used in an ultraclean room environment.
However, ultraclean room environments are often extremely
expensive to provide. Thus, the useable space within an
ultraclean environment is only available at a premium.A variety of test head manipulators are
currently available for use in ultraclean room
environments. Although some of these test head
manipulators have a variety of desirable features, the
amount of space which each of these test head
manipulators requires for proper operation may be
undesirable.A positioner facilitates docking and undocking
of an electronic test head with
