<ABSTRACT>
A roller of variable outer diameter type has 
a holding member (1) having a plurality of through holes (12) 

radially along a side surface and provided with a hollow 
portion communicating with these through holes (12); a 

sealing member (9) having diaphragms (9A) arranged so as to 
correspond to the respective through holes (12); and sliders (10) 

respectively fitted slidably in the through holes (12) and 
forming an outer peripheral surface of the roller, the 

sealing member (9) causing the sliders (10) to urge and displace 
the sliders (10) via the diaphragms (9A) by a fluid supplied 

thereinto in such a direction that the outer diameter of 
the roller is enlarged. This roller of variable outer 

diameter type is mounted on a rotary shaft portion (4) in an 
apparatus for transferring articles such as a 

transporting conveyer or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a variable 
outer diameter roller and a transferring apparatus and 
method using the same. More particularly, it relates 
to the transferring apparatus and method for shifting 
articles transported by using the rollers of variable 
outer diameter type, the transferring apparatus 
including a conveyer apparatus having such rollers of 
variable outer diameter type mounted on a shaft driven 
by a motor to transport an article, and other conveyer 
means , for example a belt conveyer, a chain conveyer 
or a roller conveyer (including one having rollers 
having a smaller outer diameter), arranged in the 
vicinity of a conveyer apparatus using such rollers of 
variable outer diameter type. A variable outer diameter roller used 
to vary the size of an outer diameter of a roller by 
using a fluid such as a compressed air has been 
proposed, for example, in Japanese Patent Application 
Unexamined Publication Nos. 3-20420 and 3-259843 in 
which an elastic cylindrical pressure chamber (including 
a combination of a plurality of pressure chambers)  
 
secured to a rotary shaft(s) is supplied with a 
compressed air to cause the cylindrical elastic body to 
be expanded for varying its diameter. Also, in shifting 
articles from one to another, an actuator such as a 
cylinder using an air or hydraulic pressure may be 
interposed. However, all of the above-mentioned devices 
have an elastic cylindrical body expanded by pressure of 
a fluid supplied thereinto so as to change the outer 
diameter size of the elastic cylindrical body. 
Typically, since the pressure of compressed air supplied 
under a centralized control in a factory is in a range 
of from about 4.5 Kgf/cm2 to about 8.5 Kgf/cm2 and hence 
widely varies in the pressure range to be unstable. In the case of the above conventional roller, 
when the ratio of the outer diameter size of an elastic 
cylindrical body in the expansion thereof to that in the 
normal state thereof is large (i.e. the coefficient 
of expansion being large), even if it is formed of a 
flexible elastic body such as a rubber, a repetition of 
expansion accompanying with an elastic strain of more 
than 50% in excess of 200,000 times tends to cause its 
fatigue fracture due to the tension thereof at an 
extremely high probability. It is extremely difficult 
to obtain elastic material in low cost in order to meet 
this problem. When a high pressure fluid, for example, a high 
pressure compressed air of about 5.5 kgf/cm2 or more,  
 
is used for transported articles

<CLAIMS>
A variable outer diameter roller 
comprising: a roller shaft (4; 121; 51; 181) having a fluid 

supply bore (15; 132) and a fluid supply opening (16; 122; 
52) communicating with said bore, characterised in that 

it comprises; at least one holding 
member (1; 123; 173; 51; 181) mounted directly or 

indirectly to said shaft, said holding member having a 
plurality of through holes (12; 128) radially arranged in a 

cylindrical side surface thereof; and sliders (10; 124; 54) 
slidably mounted in said through holes to provide a roller 

peripheral surface, and in that said fluid supply opening (16; 
122; 52) communicates with said through holes (12; 128) and 

fluid supplied under pressure to said fluid supply opening 
causes said sliders to be displaced in such a direction as 

to enlarge an outer diameter size of the roller. 
A roller as claimed in claim 1, wherein a sealing 
member (9) is located within said holding member (1), the 

sealing member (9) having diaphragms (9A) corresponding to 
said through holes (12) such that fluid supplied under 

pressure to said fluid supply opening (16) acts on the 
sealing member (9) to displace the diaphragms (9A) thereby 

causing the sliders (10) to be displaced. 
A roller as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the holding member (1) comprises a pipe(1). 
A roller as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
holding member (123; 173) comprises a disk body securely 

mounted to the shaft (121).  
 
A roller as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
holding member comprises a disk body formed integrally with 

the shaft (51; 181) 
A roller as claimed in claim 4 or claim 5, 
wherein a clearance between each slider (124; 54) and the 

through hole (128) in which it is slidably mounted is 
dimensioned to be in the order of several tens Âµm. 
A roller as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein it includes means (127; 177; 57; 187) for 

restricting a displacement amount of said sliders (124; 
54). 
A roller as claimed in any preceding claim, 
wherein the sliders (10; 124; 54) each have an arc portion 

(10B; 124B) subtending a predetermined angle which together 
form the roller peripheral surface. 
A roller as claimed in claim 8, wherein the 
roller peripheral surface includes a rubber member or a 

plastic member (11; 126) for returning the sliders (10; 
124; 54) to their undisplaced positions when fluid under 

pressure is no longer being supplied to the fluid supply 
opening (16; 122; 52). 
An apparatus for conveying articles, comprising: 
a plurality of rollers as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 

9; and conveyor means (37) arranged in the vicinity of said 
rollers. 
An apparatus as claimed in claim 11, wherein said 
conveyor means (37) comprises at least one of a belt 

conveyor, a chain conveyor and a roller conveyor.  
 
A use of an 
apparatus as claimed in claim 10 or claim 11 to convey articles.
