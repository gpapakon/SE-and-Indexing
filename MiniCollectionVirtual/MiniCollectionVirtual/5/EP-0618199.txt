<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the 
manufacture of 1-(substituted or unsubstituted)phenyl-5-(substituted 
or unsubstituted)phenyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide 
which is useful as an effective component of 
agriculture chemical compositions. The following two methods are known for 
manufacturing 1-(substituted or unsubstituted)phenyl-5-(substituted 
or unsubstituted)phenyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide 
(hereinafter referred to as triazolecarboxamide). 
(1) A method of heating 2-(substituted or 
unsubstituted)phenyl-4,5-oxazoledione 4-(substituted or 
unsubstituted)phenylhydrazone (hereinafter referred to as 
a hydrazone derivative) in an aqueous methanol containing 
a large excess of ammonia; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 79 (1957) 1955-6 and J. Chem. Soc., (1962) 575-583, (2) A method comprising heating a hydrazone 
derivative in an organic solvent, such as acetone, 
dioxane, or toluene, containing excess ammonia, and 
cyclocondensing the product with 
hydrochloric acid or acetic acid; EP-A-0 070 089 and 
EP-A-0 282 303. These methods, however, have still to be improved  
 
with respect to the use of organic solvents as a 
dispersing medium or as a solvent, the use of acidic 
compounds as a cyclocondensation catalyst, and the like. The present inventors have undertaken extensive 
studies in order to develop a more simple and economical 
process for the manufacture of triazolecarboxamides, and 
found triazolecarboxamides can be produced without using 
organic solvents or acidic compounds, but only using 
water as a dispersion medium or as a solvent. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is 
to provide a novel process for manufacturing a 
triazolecarboxamide using only water as a dispersion 
medium or as a solvent, and without using organic 
solvents or acidic compounds. The present invention relates to a process for 
manufacturing a triazolecarboxamide comprising heating a 
hydrazone derivative and ammonia in water. A more specific object of the present invention is 
to provide a process for the manufacture of 1-(substituted 
or unsubstituted)phenyl-5-(substituted or 
unsubstituted)phenyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide of 
the formula (I), which comprises heating 2-(substituted 
or unsubstituted)phenyl-4,5-oxazoledione 4-(substituted 
or unsubstituted)phenylhydrazone of the formula (II) and  
 
ammonia in water according to the following reaction 
formula, 
 
wherein A and B individually represent a substituted or 
unsubstituted phenyl group. Other objects, features and advantages
