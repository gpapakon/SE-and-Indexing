<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to fuel dispensing nozzles of 
the type described in my U.S. Patents 4,056,131, 
4,057,086, 4,343,337 and my co-pending U.S. Patent 5 174 346 (published 29/12/92). The invention more particularly relates to a fuel 
dispensing nozzle which is utilized with a pre-pay self-service 
filling station. There have recently been 
developed nozzles having a pressure actuated poppet valve 
which automatically shuts off the dispensing nozzle 
shortly after the dispenser pump is de-energized when a 
"pre-paid" amount of fuel has been dispensed. This 
prevents further flow of fuel upon re-energizing of the 
pump supplying fuel to the nozzle. Examples of such 
devices are shown in U.S. patents to Fink 4,559,982 and 
4,658,987. A fuel dispensing nozzle according to the preamble of claims 1, 4 and 6 is known from document GB-A-2 134 883. It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
safety cut-off valve which is controlled by a decrease in 
pressure of the flowing fuel, such as when the fuel pump 
slows down as it approaches the "pre-paid" amount of fuel 
to be delivered. It will automatically close the valve 
when a lower pressure exists in the flowing fuel. In the 
present invention, a slight modification of the standard 
safety nozzle (which responds to a over full tank as well 
as one having a fuel fume vent with cut-off in response to 
over pressure or under pressure in the vapor conduit) is 
provided to also permit automatic nozzle shut-off after a 
pre-paid amount of gasoline is dispensed. The present 
invention also prevents the danger that, with the pre-pay 
mode of operation, a customer will holster the nozzle 
after the preset quantity of gasoline is delivered with a  
 
hold open clip engaged in the nozzle operating lever or 
with a lever holding the fuel valve open by placing the 
hand guard over the metal tab in the center of some nozzle 
hangers and then releasing the lever. In this case, the 
metal tab would prevent the nozzle from closing. In 
either case, the next user of the nozzle might grip the 
nozzle body handle and lever in the open state without 
realizing that the nozzle valve is open resulting in an 
unwanted and dangerous spray of gasoline when the pump is 
energized. While the above patents to Fink provide a positive 
automatic disablement of the nozzle after the pre-determined 
amount of fuel has been delivered, they do not 
have the feature of the present invention which permits 
positive flow through the nozzle as soon as the fuel 
pressure rises and a

valve (44) permitting rapid flow of fuel to the fuel pressure responsive means (22) when the nozzle fuel supply 
pressure rises and a slow flow of fuel from the fuel pressure responsive means when the nozzle fuel supply 

pressure drops so that said fuel pressure responsive means (22) activates the valve closing means within a 
predetermined period of time after fuel pressure falls as the fuel flow slows and said fuel pressure

fuel pressure and a diaphragm (12) controlled by a full tank condition, and wherein said two way
