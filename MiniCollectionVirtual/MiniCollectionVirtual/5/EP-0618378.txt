<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a limit-torque 
coupling mechanism with delay restoring function, which is 

characterized in that, when the relative coupling portion is 
forced by torque to reverse the limit-torque coupling 

mechanism has delay restoring function to reduce noise and 
frictional loss arising from subsequently relative sliding 

so as to restore coupling during the decrease in torque 
difference or speed difference. The means to accomplish the 

aforesaid function lie in that, to design the torque 
coupling mechanism being forcibly reversed with such 

characteristics as mechanical friction damping, fluid 
damping or magnetic damping or the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a torque limiter.In general, a conventional torque limiter device has a
pre-compressed forced reversing mechanism. It is
understood that, when such a torque limiter is situated at
normal transmission coupling state, i.e. within the scope of
normal torque, the loss is extremely small. However, when
it is situated at over-torque and is in a relatively sliding
state, reversing pressure is formed arising from the precompression
of the reversing mechanism, whereby sliding
friction loss and noise increases between the forced
reversing mechanism and the gyrator.The aim of the invention is to provide a torque limiter
which does not suffer from the disadvantage of this known
type of limiter.The present invention provides a torque limiter
comprising a first body defining an indentation in a surface
thereof; a second body located adjacent to, and movable
relative to, the first body, the second body defining an air
chamber having a first end opening towards the first body
and a second end defining an air hole; a forced reversing
mechanism comprising an element configured to engage the
indentation in the first body, a piston attached to the
element and slidably located in the air chamber, and
biassing means acting on the piston to exert a static
pressure on the piston so as to urge the element into the
indentation in the first body; characterised by delay means
located on the second body so as to act on the piston to
delay return of movement of the piston when the element has
been disengaged from the indentation. This torque limiter has a delay restoring function,
which is characterised in that, when the relative coupling
portion is forced by torque to reverse, the torque limiter
mechanism has a delay restoring function to reduce noise and
frictional loss arising from subsequent relative sliding, so
as to restore coupling during the decrease in torque
difference or speed difference. The means to accomplish
the aforesaid delay function may comprise a coupling
mechanism being forcibly reversed with such characteristics
as mechanical friction, damping, fluid damping, magnetic
damping or the like.The invention will now be described in greater detail,
by way of example, with reference to the drawings, in
which:-

form of torque limiter;Fig 1-1 a partial cross-sectional view of the torque
