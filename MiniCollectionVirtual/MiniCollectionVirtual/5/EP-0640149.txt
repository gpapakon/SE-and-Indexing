<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for effecting domain refinement of electrical steels comprises an assembly of an array of rotatable members (2) mounted within a supporting structure (3) and movable into direct contact with the surface of a strip or sheet of electrical steel to create lines of local plastic deformation which extends generally across the width of the steel to effect domain refinement thereof. Relative linear movement is imparted between the member and the steel strip or sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and apparatus
for effecting domain refinement of electrical steels and
especially, but not exclusively, high-permeability grain-oriented
electrical steels. In particular, but not
exclusively, the invention concerns apparatus operable to
produce within steel strip and sheet lines of local
plastic deformation which refine the strip or sheet's
domain structures and reduce power loss without causing
damage to the insulation coating of the strip or sheet
thereby removing the need for recoating after treatment.It is known that the magnetic properties of grain-oriented
electrical steels can be enhanced by processing
in a known manner which effects preferential alignment of 
grains within the steel.One problem associated with known techniques for
producing enhanced magnetic properties is that effecting
optimum grain alignment tends simultaneously to produce
larger than optimum grain sizes, this resulting in higher
power losses than would have been the case with smaller
grain sizes and domain wall spacings.Known techniques for effecting domain refinement by
creation of artificial grain boundaries include mechanical
methods, lasers or high voltage discharge systems.Hitherto, mechanical methods have not been found to be
susceptible to commercial use with the result that
relatively expensive laser systems are conventionally
employed commercially. A relatively inexpensive spark
ablation method (high voltage discharge system) is being
utilised but this system tends to be rather slow for
successful commercial use.Although domain refinement can be achieved by a method
known as mechanical ball scratching in which very small
balls of diameter of the order of 0.7mm are employed which
are forced into contact with the surface of a sheet under
treatment, the method is difficult to maintain and operate
on a commercial basis. Also, scratching of the surface of
the steel occurs, and recoating of the steel after
treatment is necessary.JP-A-56036341 discloses apparatus in which a plurality
of rotatable balls of relatively small diameter are moved
across and pressed into contact with the surface of a steel
plate to produce microstrains and thereby reduce watt
losses in the treated plates.
DE-A-2 819 514 discloses an apparatus in which rotatable members
of 0.2 - 10mm diameter are pressed into contact with the surface of
the steel plate.This invention sets out to provide a method and
apparatus for refining the domain structure of high
permeability grain-oriented electrical steels in which

Apparatus for effecting domain refinement of
electrical steels comprising an assembly of an array of

rotatable members (2) mounted within a supporting structure
(3) and movable into direct contact with the surface of a

strip or sheet of electrical steel to create lines of local
plastic deformation which extend substantially across the

width of the strip or sheet to effect domain refinement
thereof, and means operable to impart relative linear

spacing between the lines of plastic deformation created by

the rotatable members (2) is between 5 mm and 15 mm, in
that the diameter of each said rotatable member is between

10 and 50 mm, and in that means are provided for

away from the supporting structure
and into contact with the surface of the steel strip or sheet

with a force of between
2 and 6 kgf (20-60 N).
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that
means are provided to move the steel strip or sheet

periodically relative to the assembly while the rotatable
members of the assembly are out of contact with the strip

or sheet surface.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that
means are provided to move the steel strip or sheet

continuously with regard to the assembly.
Apparatus as claimed in and one of Claim 1 to 3

ball of diameter of between 10mm and 50mm supported in a
bearing race which is resiliently biased away from its 

supporting structure and into contact with the surface of

each ball is produced from a chrome steel or silicon

nitride.

A method of effecting domain refinement of a strip or
sheet of electrical steel which is characterised by the

steps of creating in the strip of sheet lines of local

the lines of plastic deformation being between 5mm and
15mm, and the force applied by the balls to the surface of

the strip or sheet being between 2 and 6 kgf (20-60 N).
