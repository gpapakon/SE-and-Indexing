<ABSTRACT>
In a process for cornering identification, in particular for motor vehicles with ABS or ASR, the speeds of rotation of both wheels of a (non driven) axle are measured and a correction value for the difference between the tyre rolling circumferences of both wheels is determined. A reference value (THR) representing driving in a straight line is continuously formed and this reference value is continuously corrected depending on the speed difference between both wheels according to a predetermined time scheme. To identify curves, a speed difference value (DIF) is compared with the reference value (THR). The reference value (THR) is corrected at relatively short intervals at the beginning, i.e., when cornering identification starts, and as said cornering continues, the intervals are increased. The change rate (THR) of the reference value (THR) is also high at the beginning and then decreases.

<CLAIMS>
A cornering identification method provided, in particular, 
for automotive vehicles with anti-lock and/or traction slip 

control, measuring the rotating velocities of the two 
wheels of one axle, continuously detecting and correcting 

a correction value by taking into account the velocity 
difference of the two wheels of one axle and by filtering 

the difference value, comparing the velocity difference 
with the momentary correction value and evaluating it for 

cornering identification,
characterized
 in that the correction value is 
a reference value (THR) representative of a straight-line 

course, and is corrected in accordance with a time pattern 
or time grid, having steps or periods (T
K
) which are 
relatively short after the start of the time pattern or 

time grid and will be prolonged stepwise or continuously. 
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the periods (n T
K
), in 
accordance with which the reference value (THR) is 

corrected, lie in the order of magnitude ranging between 10 
and 50 seconds (T
K
) at the beginning and in the order of 
magnitude ranging between 40 seconds and 8 minutes (n T
K
) 
in a final state. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that the reference value 
(THR) is corrected by means of predetermined, variable,  

 
percentage rates of change. 
A method as claimed in claim 3,
characterized
 in that the rate of change is 
varied in at least three subsequent steps and, at the 

beginning, ranges between 0.2% and 1%, preferably between 
0.3% and 0.4%, thereupon lying between 0.1% and 0.5%, 

preferably between 0.1% and 0.3%, and for the rest lying 
between 0.05% and 0.2%, preferably between 0.1% and 0.15%, 

of a theoretically maximum reference value (THR). 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 2 
through 4,
characterized
 in that the minimum times (T
K
), 
after the expiration of which correction of the reference 

value (THR) is possible, will be increased if, within 
predetermined periods (T
U
), the velocity differences are 
small or no correction of reference value (THR) took place. 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 2 
through 5,
characterized
 in that the percentage rates of 
change (delta THR
1,2,3
) will be reduced if, within 
predetermined periods (T
U
), the velocity differences are 
small or no correction of reference value (THR) took place. 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1 
through 6,
characterized
 in that the reference value 
(THR) is obtained by means of a counter (LN) which,  

 
starting from a mean, registers a deviation of the velocity 

differences or of the difference value (DIF) from the 
reference value (THR) and, as soon as the deviation reaches 

a limit value (terminal counter value) and/or persists 
beyond a predetermined period, will increase or decrease 

the reference value (THR) by a predetermined percentage 
value in the direction of a reduction of the deviations. 
A method as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that, as long as the 
deviation of the velocity difference value (DIF) from the 

reference value (THR) has the same direction, the contents 
of the counter (LN) will be increased or decreased at a 

rate of the counting cycle (z) and in that correction of 
the reference value (THR) will take place when an upper or 

lower terminal value of the counter is reached. 
A method as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that a counting speed of the 
counter (LN) is variable and, starting from a relatively 

fast cycle (T
1
) at the beginning, is halved several times 
(T
2
, T
3
, T
4
). 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1 
through 9,
characterized
 in that cornering 
identification is started by operating an ignition of an 

engine of the automotive vehicle. 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1  
 

through 10,
characterized
 in that cornering 
identification will not be evaluated before a threshold 

value of vehicle velocity (v
FZ
) will have been exceeded. 
A method as claimed in claim 11,
characterized
 in that a velocity threshold 
value is selected which ranges between 20 and 40 km/hr. 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1 
through 12,
characterized
 in that, in a vehicle with 
front wheel drive or rear wheel drive, the rotational 

behaviour of the non-driven wheels is evaluated. 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1 
through 12,
characterized
 in that, in an all-wheel drive 
vehicle, rotational behaviour of the wheels of one axle is 

evaluated which are less influenced by the drive. 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1 
through 14,
characterized
 in that one or several 
additional memories (Grad U; "gradient") are used which 

register the change of respectively the velocity difference 
value (DIF) or of the gradient of the velocity difference 

value and serve the fast identification of steering-in and 
steering-out operations, of quick steering changes, etc.  

 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1 
through 15,
characterized
 in that vehicle velocity or 
vehicle reference velocity (v
FZ
) is compared with the 
velocity of the wheels monitored for cornering 

identification and in that the evaluation of cornering 
identification will be interrupted as soon as the 

difference between the vehicle (reference) velocity and a 
slower wheel exceeds a predetermined limit value, and in 

that the status of cornering identification detected until 

this time is considered constant. 
A method as claimed in one or in several of claims 1 
through 16,
characterized
 in that, upon the onset of 
anti-lock control or traction slip control, the status of 

cornering identification detected until this time is 
considered constant.
