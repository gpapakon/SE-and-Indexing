Measuring device for measuring the air flow rate in 
milking installations consisting of a closed housing (1) 

with a connection piece (2) for the line to be checked for 
pressure and air flow, whereby the housing is provided 

with an air inlet device, 
characterised in that
 an air inlet 
socket (4) is arranged on the exterior of the housing 

(1) whose opening cross-section can be altered relative to 
an opening (6) provided in the housing interior b
y turning, 
whereby the opening constantly widens in a rotary 

slide valve (5) and stretches over a substantial part of 
the latter's circumferance, the air inlet socket (4) features 

a slit-shaped opening whose longitudinal axis runs 
parallel to the rotational axis of the rotary slide valve 

(5), the inside diameter of the air inlet socket (4) in 
the direction of the circumferance is only a fraction of 

the span of the opening (6), any partial area of the opening 
(6) can be brought into connection with the opening 

of the air inlet socket (4) by turning the rotary slide 
valve (5) and the air inlet socket (4) can be moved radially 

relative to the housing (1). 
Measuring device according to claim 1, characterised in  
 

that the air inlet socket (4) is under spring tension, 
which is directed onto the rotary slide valve (5). 
Measuring device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that a connection exists between the rotary slide 

valve (5) and a step-down gear (8). 
Measuring device according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the step-down gear (8) is connected 

with a drive motor (7). 
Measuring device in accordance with one of the claims 1 
to 4, characterised in that the rotary slide valve is provided 

with a first rotational angle transmitter (9). 
Measuring device according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the drive motor (7) is provided with 

a second rotational angle transmitter (10).
