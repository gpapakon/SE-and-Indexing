<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an organic
electroluminescent display panel used in a display
apparatus and comprising a plurality of organic
electroluminescent elements (also referred to herein as
EL elements) each including an emitting layer made of an
organic compound material, which utilizes an
electroluminescence phenomenon that is the emission of
light resulting from injection of an electric current to
the emitting layer. In particular, it is related to a
full color display device comprising a matrix of the EL
elements. More particularly, the present invention is
related to an organic electroluminescent display
panel of the kind as defined in the preamble of claim 1.
Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method for
manufacturing an organic electroluminescent display panel
of the kind as defined in the preamble of claim 10.
A display panel and a method of this kind is known from EP-A-0 550 062.Generally, the formations of the cathode and the
organic function layers of EL media in the organic EL
element are difficult in a micro-patterning art, since
there are the low levels in durabilities of heat
resistance (100Â°C or less), wet-proof and solvent-resisting
of the organic EL media used for the carrier
injection layers, the emitting layer or the like in the
function layers. If the ordinary photolithography
patterning is utilized for the formation of such function
layers of the organic EL element, the solvent in the 
photoresist infiltrates into the function layers of the
EL element to be damaged, and the organic EL element is
damaged during the photoresist baking with a high
temperature atmosphere, and further, the development
solution or etching liquid for the photoresist layer also
intrudes into the organic EL element to be damaged. Even
plasma in the dry-etching for the photoresist layer
damages the organic function layers of the EL element.
These damages cause the deterioration in the performance
of the organic EL element and emission properties. This
is a serious problem.Alternatively, there is a vacuum deposit patterning
by using a shadow mask to form the cathode and the
organic function layers of the organic EL element. In
this case, there are many problems in that the mask comes
into contact with a substrate on which the organic
function layers are formed. That is, the leakage of the
vapor of organic EL media occurs between the mask and the
substrate due to incomplete contact thereof. Otherwise,
the shadow mask is compulsorily, sealingly put into
contact with the substrate. In this
