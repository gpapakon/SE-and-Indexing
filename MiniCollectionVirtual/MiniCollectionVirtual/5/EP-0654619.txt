<ABSTRACT>
Suspension for a vibrating element, comprising a bearing (2) supported on a machine part (3), a supporting mount supported on the bearing (2) by a spring body, and an inertia mass (7) which can be moved back and forth by a drive parallel to the direction of the operationally induced vibrations. The inertia mass (7) is flexibly mounted and, relative to the exciting vibration, is movable in the opposite direction. In this arrangement, the inertia mass (7) is connected to the support (2) by a spring (5), and the inertia mass (7) and the spring (5) are not touched by a liquid.
