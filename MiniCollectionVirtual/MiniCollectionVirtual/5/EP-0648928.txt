<ABSTRACT>
The mounting assembly for a crankshaft is integrated with the cylinder block of an IC engine. It has inner bonding points (10) through the screw bolts (5) of the bearing cap (3), where the bolts (5) have a cylindrical shoulder (11). Distance sleeves (13) are pressed over the bolt shoulders (11), with a threading (14) to take the threaded inner bonding point (10) of the reinforcement component (6).

Internal combustion engine having a crankshaft fixed in
an engine block (1) by means of bearing caps (3) and a

stiffening member (6) connected at the bottom to the engine
block (1) at its edges (7) and at internal connection points

(10) to the bearing caps (3),

characterised in that

the internal connection points (10) are provided by the
screw bolts (5) of the bearing caps (3) for the

crankshaft,
the screw bolts (5) are provided with a cylindrical
extension (11), and
spacer sleeves (13) are fitted thereon with a press fit,
the spacer sleeves (13) having a threaded portion (14 or

18') to receive the screw connection for the internal
connection points (10) of the stiffening member(6 or 6').
Internal combustion engine having internal connection
points according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the cylindrical extension (11) on the screw bolt (5) for
the bearing cap (3) forms the major diameter and is

surrounded by the spacer sleeve (13), which is put on
with a press fit (at 12), and
the spacer sleeve (13) has an internal thread (14) to
receive a screw bolt (14) to secure the stiffening member

(6) and an annular shoulder (15) to support the
stiffening member (6) through its socket extensions (16).
Internal combustion engine having internal connection
points according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the cylindrical portion (11) is formed on the screw bolt
(5) for the bearing cap (3) of the crankshaft as the

external diameter and is surrounded by the spacer sleeve
(13'), which is put on with a press fit (at 12'), and
the spacer sleeve (13') is directly connected to a screw
bolt (18') to receive a nut (19) and the spacer sleeve

(13') is provided with an annular step (15') and socket
extensions (16') are provided on the stiffening member

(6').
Internal combustion engine having internal connection
points according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the spacer sleeve (20) is provided with a through opening
(22) for the screw bolt (5'') of the bearing cap (3''),
the base of the spacer sleeve (20) is optionally
connected non-rotatably to the bearing cap (3'') by means

e.g. of a key and groove connection (23/24), and
the spacer sleeve (20) has a cylindrical portion in which
is received, with a press fit, one end of a securing bolt

(25) which has a threaded portion (26) and can be braced
by way of its annular collar (27) against the socket

extension (28) of the stiffening member (6'') by means of
a nut (30) acting through a washer (29) and the

connection is sealed by means of a O-ring seal (31).
Internal combustion engine having internal connection
points according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the spacer sleeve (20) is held non-rotatably directly by
the screw bolt (5'') of the bearing cap (3''), optionally

by means e.g. of a key and groove connection (23/24), and
the spacer sleeve (20) has an internal cylindrical
portion in which is received, with a press fit, one end

of a fastening bolt (32) the other end of which has a
portion of reduced diameter which extends into a blind

bore (34) in a socket extension (35) in the stiffening
member (6'''),
an O-ring seal (36) is disposed between the spacer sleeve
(20) and the socket extension (35),and
the space between the cylindrical portion (33) of the
fastening bolt (32) and the blind bore (30) in the socket

extension (35) is filled with a hardenable material (38),
e.g. plastics material, which can be introduced under

pressure through a bore (37).
Internal combustion engine having internal connection
points according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the spacer sleeve is in the form of a silentbloc (40),
comprising a ring (43) of plastics material received

between an inner jacket (41) and an outer jacket (42),
its inner jacket (41) being received on the cylindrical
extensions (11''') of the screw bolts (5''') and
its outer jacket (43) being received in a blind bore
(34''') in the stiffening member (6"").
