<ABSTRACT>
An ozone storage apparatus is disclosed for storing ozone
efficiently. A process for efficient water treatment is also

disclosed. The ozone storage container has a generally U-shape
and is filled with an absorbent. The ozone is supplied and

discharged from the same opening. The temperature of the
absorbent is kept between 0°C and -30°C. The generated ozone

from an ozone generating means 11 is cooled by a cooling device
22 and is supplied to a storage device 29.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ozone storage method and
an ozone storage apparatus. Further, it relates to an ozone
storage method and apparatus for storing ozone and extracting
ozone by adsorption when it is demanded.In recent years, people have been very concerned about the
environment. They are primarily concerned about water which has
an intimate relation to their life.Harmful chemicals such as some types of organic matter,
ammonia, and so on, and other types of matter which may cause
odors and colors are contained in secondary sewage treatment
water, secondary night soil treatment water, industrial waste
water, tap water, small water supply system water, exclusive tap
water, water for industrial use, wastewater recycling system
water, and effluents from fish farms and culture ponds. Further,
organic matter such as environmental hormones are sometimes 
included and these elements are difficult to decompose through
regular water treatments.Accordingly, it is necessary to treat water thoroughly.
Various water treatment methods have been investigated.
Ozonolysis is a known decomposing method for decomposing organic
matter such as environmental hormones.Ozone is an oxidizer that is easy to use, and since it
decomposes into oxygen, the concerns about secondary pollution
are reduced. Therefore it is widely used for sterilizing,
cleansing and oxidizing. However, ozone typically cannot be
stored in cylinders or other containers since ozone, as a general
rule, easily decomposes. Therefore, a silent discharge ozone
generator, an ozone generator using an ultra-violet lamp or an
electrolytic ozone generator is placed near the water treatment
apparatus. The ozone generator is used to generate ozone that is
directly used by the water treatment apparatus. However, with
this method it is difficult to produce ozone to match a change in
the required amount of ozone. Also, this method requires a great
deal of electric power to generate the ozone.The conventional ozone absorption/desorption operation will
be explained below.Japanese laid-open patent publication no. 11-292512 and
other references disclose a conventional ozone storing technique.
In this technique, ozone is absorbed for storage by an absorbent
when the absorbent is cooled to a temperature not higher than-30°C 
by a cooling means and the compressed ozone is supplied to
the absorbent. When desorbing ozone from the absorbent, the
absorbent then needs to be heated and decompressed.This means that when the absorbent absorbs ozone, it is
compressed up to 5

A method of storing ozone comprising the steps of:

cooling the ozone to between 0°C and -80°C by a cooling
means; and
supplying the ozone to a storage means which is filled with
a silica gel.
A method of storing ozone comprising the steps of:

cooling the ozone;
supplying the ozone to a storage means which is filled with
a silica gel by applying a pressure of 1-2 atm while maintaining

a temperature of the silica gel between 0°C and -30°C.
A method of storing ozone comprising the steps of:

cooling the ozone; and
supplying the ozone to a silica gel that is cooled to
between 0°C and -30°C for storing the ozone; and
using oxygen as a purge gas for the stored ozone.
A method of storing ozone according to claim 3, wherein
the oxygen used as the purge gas is compressed and supplied at 1-2

atm.
An ozone storage apparatus comprising:

a container having two openings, said container being filled
with an absorbent; and
one of the openings being structured and arranged so as to
allow an ozone containing gas to be supplied into the container,

whereby the ozone can be absorbed by the absorbent.
An ozone storage apparatus comprising:

a container having two openings, said container being filled
with an absorbent;
a first opening for introducing an ozone containing gas into
said container so as to allow ozone to be absorbed by the

absorbent; and
a second opening for introducing oxygen into said container
so as to discharge ozone from said first opening.
An ozone storage apparatus comprising:

a U-shaped container having openings in an upper part of
said container, said container being filled with an absorbent;

and
at least one of the openings allowing ozone to be introduced
into said container so as to be absorbed by said absorbent.
An ozone storage apparatus comprising:

a plurality of U-shaped containers each containing an
absorbent for storing ozone; and
wherein said plurality of U-shaped containers are connected
in at least one of a series connection and a parallel connection

so as to introduce the ozone continuously into said plurality of
U-shaped containers.
