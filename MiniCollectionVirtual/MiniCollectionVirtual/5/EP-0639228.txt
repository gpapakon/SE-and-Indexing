<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a
method of DNA typing for the detection of short tandem
repeat sequence polymorphisms. More particularly, it
relates to the method of detecting short tandem repeat
sequences which show polymorphisms in the number of
repeats for the detection or identification of medical
and forensic samples, paternity, sample origin and
tissue origin. Additionally it further relates to the
method of identifying polymorphic short tandem repeats
in genomes.The volume of crime committed in the United States
has risen with the increase of population and expansion
of population centers. A large portion of violent
crimes involve the creation of body fluid evidence
having the potential of providing significant
information about the perpetrator of a particular
offense. Although the forensic science community has
made tremendous effort in using this evidence, the
results have historically been limited and are not
useful in many situations when dealing with human 
remains and crime scene evidence. Identification by
genetically inherited markers has long been seen as a
possibility that would overcome most of the problems
that are encountered when identification is not
accomplished by fingerprints, forensic odontology,
medical records or other methods. The establishment of
a genetically inherited method that could be used for
identification would have tremendous impact on
investigation of the violent crimes of sexual assault
and murder, identification of human remains and missing
persons, and disputed parentage.Methods enabling the matching of unidentified
tissue samples to specific individuals would have wide
application in the criminal justice system and the
forensic sciences. With the possible exception of
monozygotic twins, each individual in the human
population has a unique genetic composition which could
be used to specifically identify each individual. This
phenomenon presents the theoretical possibility of
using DNA sequence variation to determine whether a
forensic sample was derived from any given individual.Genetic marker systems, including blood groups and
isoenzymes, have been used by forensic and medical
serologists to provide estimates of individuality
ranging from 1:1000 to 1:1,000,000 using 10 to 15
markers. Numbers in this range are often not available
since a large percentage of the evidence does not yield
results for ten genetic marker systems. Forensic
scientists, investigators and the court system have
been using inclusions as low as 1:5 to 1:100 in a
population to
