<ABSTRACT>
A solid (I) containing aluminium oxide (Al2O3) is obtained by a process comprising contacting Al2O3 precursor(s) (II) with a template compound(s) in a liquid medium, in which the template is a membrane lipid (III) or mixture of 2 or more of these. Also claimed are (i) the method of producing (I) in this way; and (ii) the use of (III) as template in the production of (I).

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing an alumina solid, which
comprises the step of contacting in a liquid

medium at least one alumina precursor with at
least one template comprising a membrane lipid or

a mixture of two or more thereof.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
membrane lipid is a phospholipid or a mixture of

two or more thereof.
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the
alumina solid comprises at least one element

selected from the group consisting of sodium,
potassium, calcium, magnesium, beryllium, boron,

gallium, indium, silicon, germanium, tin, lead,
bismuth, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium,

niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten,
manganese, rhenium, iron, cobalt, nickel,

ruthenium, copper, zinc, cadmium, mercury and
cerium.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein the precursor is additionally contacted

with a pharmacologically active organic or
inorganic compound, an enzyme, a pigment or a 

mixture of two or more thereof.
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,
wherein the contacting is carried out in the

presence of an inert porous support or at a static
interface.
The use of a solid prepared by a process as claimed
in any of claims 1 to 5 as matrix for active

components, in membrane, separation or purification
processes, for producing electrical, optical or

electro-optic components, for producing oxide
ceramics or for separating substances, as filler,

as fire retardant and as abrasives and polishing
materials.
A use of a solid prepared by a process as claimed
in any of claims 1 to 5 as a catalyst or catalyst

support in hydrocarbon oxyfunctionalization, olefin
oxidation to give oxiranes, aromatics alkylation,

hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, hydration, dehydration,
isomerization, an addition reaction, an

elimination reaction, a nucleophilic or
electrophilic substitution, a dehydrocyclization,

hydroxylation of heteroatoms, aromatics hydroxylation,
epoxy-aldehyde rearrangement, amination of

monomeric or oligomeric olefins, an aldol type
condensation reaction, a polymerization reaction,

an esterification or etherification, the catalytic
conversion of exhaust gases and flue gases or for

nitrogen oxide removal.
The use of a membrane lipid or a mixture of two or
more thereof as templates in the preparation of an

alumina solid.
