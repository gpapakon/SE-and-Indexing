<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with a rate detecting method for detecting
a predetermined rate at which a received signal has been coded,

the coded signal is decoded based on a first synchronizing signal
having a frequency corresponding to a first rate such that a first

decoded signal (ST11) is generated and then it is judged whether
or not synchronization is determined for the first decoded signal

(ST12). If the synchronization cannot be determined, there is
generated only a second synchronizing signal having a frequency

corresponding to a second rate having a difference between itself
and a first rate which is smaller than a permissible value of the

rate determined by the lower and upper values of the rate (ST13,
ST17).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rate detecting method and a rate
detecting apparatus each for detecting, upon receipt of a signal coded at a
predetermined rate, the rate of the coded signal that has been received.In the field of digital CS broadcasting or the like, a Viterbi decoding
method has been used as one of the convolutional decoding methods. If a coded
signal is received and the rate r (m ≦ r ≦ n where m represents a minimum value and
n represents a maximum value) of the received signal is unknown to the receiving
side, the rate r has been detected conventionally by determining the synchronization
of the coded signal by using a Viterbi decoder. In this case, it is sensed whether or
not the synchronization can be determined by sequentially varying the frequency of a
clock signal for determining the synchronization from the minimum value m of the
coded signal to the maximum value n thereof in the receiving apparatus. If the
synchronization cannot be determined even when the clock signal reaches the
frequency corresponding to the maximum value n of the rate, the clock signal is reset
to 
the frequency corresponding to the minimum value m of the rate and it is
judged again whether or not the synchronization can be determined. The
foregoing processes is repeatedly performed till the synchronization is
determined.In the conventional rate detecting method and apparatus, however,
digital noise arises due to a significant change in the frequency of the clock
signal which occurs when the clock signal is reset from the frequency
corresponding to the maximum value n of the rate to the frequency
corresponding to the minimum value m thereof. If the rate detecting apparatus
and an analog circuit are integrated in a single substrate as a semiconductor
integrate circuit, the problem is encountered that the digital noise adversely
affects the performance characteristics of the semiconductor integrated
circuit.GB-A-2316585 describes a synchronization apparatus for adjusting a phase
synchronization and a pattern synchronization provided by using a
pres-stored code rate after pre-storing code rates synchronized for each
channel in the vent of receiving the signal of the same channel; The method
is provided for performing a fast and an effective synchronization by
depuncturing the Viterbi-decoding transmitted convolutional codes punctured
in a predetermined puncturing pattern assuming that a code rate is 5/6,
comparing the calculated CBER (Channel Bit Error Rate) to a high/low
threshold value, determining a code
