<ABSTRACT>
In a round-baling press for agricultural stalk crops, there is arranged between a pick-up (4) and a crop entry orifice (18) a conveying roller (30) which is driven above a feed-channel bottom (29) in the same circumferential direction (31) as the pressing elements (13, 15, 16), rotates from the bottom upwards and has rigid tines (33) which cooperate with a stripping grid (38). The conveying roller (30) actively assists the bale rotation.

<CLAIMS>
Round bale press for agricultural blade crops, which is provided with a pressing
chamber (14), which, on the circumference, leaving an aperture (18) for the

product to enter, is defined by revolving pressing elements, which are driven
revolvingly coming from the bottom to the top on their side facing the pressing

chamber (14) in the region of the product inlet aperture(18), and wherein
between a pick-up (4) and the product inlet aperture (18) a revolving conveyor

driven in the same circumferential direction (31) as the pressing elements (13,
15, 16) is provided, consisting of a conveying roller (30) with rigid prongs (33)

which is disposed directly in front of the product inlet aperture (18) and above a
supply channel base (29), so as to be fixed but rotatable in the supply channel

(28), with a stripper grid (38) allocated to the prongs, with the supply channel
(28) opening into the pressing chamber (14) approximately at the level of the

pressing chamber base, characterised in that the pressing chamber (14) is
formed to be variable and is defined at the bottom by rollers (15, 16) as a

pressing element whilst conveyor belts (13) or conveyor bar chains guided or
driven by pulleys (11, 12) and disposed above the rollers act as a pressing

element, in which case the region between the conveyor roller (30) or stripper
grid (38) and the lower deflection pulley (17) has a driven pressing roller (39)

with a conveying circumferential face which revolves in the same direction (25,
26) as the conveyor belt sections, extends over the same pressing chamber

width and which is disposed with clearance from the stripper grid (38) slightly
offset into the pressing chamber (14) and lies approximately below the

deflection pulley (17).
Round bale press according to claim 1, characterised in that the binding
medium such as e.g. yarn, netting or the like is supplied by means of the

pressing roller (39) to the pressing chamber (14) through a gap (42) between
the pressing roller (39) and the stripper grid (38) or via a guide plate (41)

covering the stripper grid (38) in the region of the binding medium supply. 
Round bale press according to claim 2, characterised in that the guide plates
(41, 43) disposed between the two side walls (7) in the supply region of the

binding medium form with the outer trunk (44) of the conveyor belt (13) a type

of supply shaft (45) for the binding medium.
Round bale press according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
conveyor roller (30) consists of a large number of prongs (33) spaced laterally

from one another on a central tube (32) and staggered with respect to one
another in the circumferential direction in a helical manner, the prongs (33)

cooperating with a stripper finger (34) engaging from above between every two
prongs (33).
Round bale press according to claim 4, characterised in that the prongs (33)
revolve in planes lying adjacently parallel to one another perpendicular to the

axis of the central tube, the prongs (33) being disposed adjacent to one
another at a close distance of approximately 15 mm and the stripper finger

thickness (36) is approximately half (6-8 mm) the gap width (35) of the prongs
(33).
Round bale press according to claim 5, characterised by half-ring discs with
projecting teeth, the inner faces of the half-rings being inserted at least partly in

groove-like recesses in the central tube (32).
Round bale press according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised by cutting
blades (46) projecting down into the supply channel (28), which are disposed

distributed over the pressing chamber width so as to pivot inwards and
outwards.
