<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus 
includes a photoreceptor drum (15) on which a toner image is 

formed, a transfer drum (11) for transferring the toner image 
to paper by bringing the paper into contact with the 

photoreceptor drum (15), the transfer drum (11) having a dielectric 
layer (28), a semi-conductive layer (27) and 

a conductive layer (26) 
laminated in this order from the paper side, a power 

source which is connected to the conductive layer so as to 
apply a predetermined voltage to the conductive layer (26), and 

a conductive roller (12) for pressing the paper against a 
surface of the dielectric layer (28) so as to produce a 

potential difference between the conductive layer (26) and the 
paper (P). The potential difference induces charges of the 

same polarity as the voltage applied to the conductive 
layer on the surface of the dielectric layer, and charges 

of the opposite polarity on a back surface of the paper 
pressed against the surface of the dielectric layer. 

Thus, the paper electrostatically adheres to the transfer 
drum (11) in a satisfactory manner. Moreover, unlike charging 

by atmospheric discharge, since the surface potential of 
the transfer drum is stable, it is possible to prevent 

unsatisfactory transfers and improve the image quality.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to image forming apparatuses such as a copying machine, laser printer, digital printer, scanner printer, facsimile machine, and laser facsimile machine, and more particularly to a structure for satisfactorily transferring a toner image formed on a photoreceptor to a sheet of recording material such as recording paper by holding the recording material on a surface of a transfer body, for example, a transfer drum and a structure for satisfactorily separating the recording material from the transfer body.In recent years, regarding an image forming apparatus for forming an image on recording paper, the following structure has been proposed. With this structure, the recording paper adheres to and is held on a transfer drum which is in contact with and rotates together with a photoreceptor drum. An electrostatic latent image formed on the photoreceptor drum is developed into a toner image by attracting toner to the electrostatic image, and the toner image is then transferred to transfer paper wound around the transfer drum.For example, as illustrated in Fig. 31, an image forming apparatus of this type includes a cylinder 101 provided with a dielectric layer 101a as the transfer drum. Disposed separately inside the cylinder 101 are a corona charger 102 for attracting transfer paper P, and a corona charger 104 for transferring a toner image formed on a surface of a photoreceptor drum 103 to the transfer paper P. The adhesion and transfer of the transfer paper P are separately carried out by the charger 102 and 104.An image forming apparatus shown in Fig. 32 includes a cylinder 201 having a double-layer structure formed by a semi-conductive layer 201a as an outer layer and a substrate 201b as an inner layer, and a grip mechanism 202 for holding the transported transfer paper P around the cylinder 201. Then, the toner image on the photoreceptor drum 103 is transferred to the transfer paper P by applying a voltage to the semi-conductive layer 201a as the outer layer of the cylinder 201 or charging a surface of the cylinder 201 by discharges of a charger in the cylinder 201.However, in an image forming apparatus shown in Fig. 31, since the cylinder 101 as the transfer roller has a single-layer structure formed by only the dielectric layer 101a, it is necessary to dispose the corona chargers 102 and 104 therein. This structure restricts the size of the cylinder 101, and prevents a reduction in the size of the image forming apparatus.Whereas in an image forming apparatus shown in Fig.
