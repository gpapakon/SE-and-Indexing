<ABSTRACT>
Precursors of a C/C (carbon/carbon) composite are 
calcined in a furnace without allowing the tar produced to 

sticking to the inner wall of the furnace, etc. Gasified 
tar produced from the precursors being calcined is 

discharged by a tar discharge device which has a pipe 
extending from the calcining case in the chamber of the 

calcining furnace to the outside of the furnace, a pump and 
a solenoid valve. By keeping the pressure in the calcining 

case lower than the pressure in the chamber of the 
calcining furnace, tar is prevented from sticking inside 

the furnace. In another pressure calcining apparatus, the 
opening of the calcining case is closed by a lid and the 

precursors are put one over another with spacers 
therebetween and they are pressed by a punch inserted into 

the calcining case.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for manufacturing a C/C (carbon/carbon)
composite, a material gathering much attention these days
because of its low weight, high strength and excellent heat
resistance, by calcining its precursor, while keeping high
working ratio.There are many known methods of manufacturing C/C
composites as shown in Japan Aviation & Space Society
journal, volume 41, No. 471 (issued April, 1993), at page
182, Table 4.Among these known methods are impregnating/carbonizing
method, combination method and Across method.
In these methods, carbon fiber is bound with resin and
heated in a calcining furnace to carbonize the resin and
thus form a carbon matrix. In the impregnating/carbonizing
method, it is a well-known practice to repeat the resin-impregnation
and calcining/carbonizing steps many times to
increase the density of the C/C composite to a desired
level.Also, another method is sometimes adopted in which
carbon fiber is bound with a matrix material (such as
resin, resin film, pitch and carbon powder) and the
precursor thus formed is calcined or sintered in a 
calcining furnace while pressing it by means of a hot
press. This method is adopted if a product having a
relatively high density is desired.It is also known that fibers used in the production
of C/C composites have much influence on the properties of
the finished products. Currently, it is considered
important to develop a technique for processing coal tar
pitch, petroleum pitch and acrilonitrile into fibrous form
and calcining them. As for matrix materials, pitches such
as coal tar pitch and petroleum pitch, and phenolic, epoxy,
fran and polyimide resins, which are all high in the
carbonizing rate, are used. Carbon powder is sometimes
added.Fig. 3 shows a conventional method and apparatus for
calcining a C/C composite precursor formed by binding
fibers with resin. The conventional calcining apparatus
shown in Fig. 3 has a calcining furnace 1 having a chamber
2 in which are mounted a heat insulating material 3, a
calcining case 4 made of carbon and provided inside the
insulating material 3, and a heater 5 which utilizes carbon
resistance and surrounds the case 4. The precursor A
placed in the case 4 is calcined by heating the case 4 with
the heater 5.The power of the heater 5 is controlled by monitoring
the temperature in the chamber by an infrared thermometer 
6. Exchange of the gas in the chamber 2 is carried out by
closing the chamber hermetically, drawing the gas with a
vacuum pump 7 until the
