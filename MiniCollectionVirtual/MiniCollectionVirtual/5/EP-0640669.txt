<ABSTRACT>
The temperature adjustable coating and medium and
method for providing an electrically-resistant

temperature-adjustable article and structure. The
coating provides a continuous electrically-conductive

electrically-resistive path for the application of
electrical current to the coating. The electrically-resistant

temperature-adjustable article consists of a
surface on which a high-temperature conductive-resistive

coating is bound. The surface temperature of the
article along the path is thereby adjustable between

ambient and 2000°F in response to electric current
applied to it without oxidization destroying the

electrical conductivity of the medium in temperatures
above 600°F. The medium possesses the high-temperature

conductive-resistive quality of the coating while
maintaining a clay consistency capable of being formed

into various shapes without a substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to temperature-producing
conductive-resistive coating and medium, and
to a method of producing a variety of articles
therefrom.There have been many attempts to produce
electrically-conductive coatings such as paints.
Generally, there are two types of electrically-conductive
coatings. The first is a low resistivity,
high conductivity paint that contains a pigmentation of
metal particles while the second is a high resistivity,
low conductivity paint that is formed from compositions
containing carbon or graphite that oxidize at
temperatures above 600°F, and lose their electrically
conductive ability.Low resistivity paints have traditionally been used
to provide coatings having high conductivity for
connecting conductors that require a superior electrical
bond with a minimum resistance. Generally, low
resistivity paints cannot be applied to materials in
order to produce temperature adjustable heating elements
because the low resistivity paint requires a high volume
of current to generate a reasonable output of heat. In
contrast, the resistivity of traditional highly
resistive paints is often so high that a relatively high
voltage drop is required in order to generate sufficient
heat. Also, the use of traditional high resistivity
paints within highly elevated temperatures oxidize and
lose electrical conductivity permanently. Furthermore,
when either of the above-identified traditional
conductive paints are applied to various substrates,
cracks and flaking of the paint often develop over a
period of time. Cracks and flaking of the paint coating 
may cause arcing and unequal power distribution
sacrificing safety. Concomitantly, a breakdown in the
temperature adjustable property of the coating may occur
thereby causing an unequal heat distribution upon the
surface of the article.It is therefore an object of this invention to
provide an electrically resistant temperature-adjustable
conductive composition for application to a variety of
substrates that can be formed into various shapes with
structural integrity without a substrate to provide
temperature control properties in a high temperature
range without the non-continuous electrically conductive
components oxidizing and losing conductivity in an
oxygen atmosphere in temperatures above 600°F.It is another object of the invention to provide an
electrically resistant temperature-adjustable conductive
composition for application to a variety of materials
wherein a thin coat of the electrically- resistant
temperature-adjustable
