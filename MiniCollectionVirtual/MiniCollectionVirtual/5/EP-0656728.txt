<ABSTRACT>
A bi-directional broadcasting system for preparing 
a plurality of pay video programs and a plurality of 

channels on the broadcasting side and designating one of the 
plurality of channels according to the selection of a 

specific pay video program by the receiving side to thereby 
broadcast the selected pay video program through the 

selected channel as occasion demands. In the bi-directional 
broadcasting system, a predetermined CM is broadcasted 

according to the allowable degree of video reception by each 
viewer prior to the broadcasting of the pay video program 

selected on the receiving side. A dip switch attached to a 
receiver is set according to the allowable degree of video 

reception by each viewer. Information about the setting of 
the dip switch is transmitted to the broadcasting side 

through a modem upon selecting the pay video program. 
Further, a control unit for controlling the frequency of 

reception of CM in the form of a picture is provided in a 
remote control transmitter. According to the above 

construction, the broadcasting side can properly correspond 
to the allowable degree of CM reception by the viewer. When 

the CM is sent to the viewer, the viewer can reliably watch 
it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of 
television broadcast systems and more particularly to those 
systems suitable for use in so called pay TV or video on 
demand broadcast and reception. A TV system has heretofore been known wherein 
television program material is broadcast on VHF and UHF 
broadcasting frequency bands or via cable broadcast CATV or 
satellite broadcast systems. Television program material 
distributed from a broadcast source to a service provider 
through communications satellite(CS) are typically 
transmitted at a mid-band or a super high band of a VHF 
television broadcasting frequency band and may be further 
distributed to a number of subscribers through transmission 
media such as a coaxial cable, etc. Since the multi-channel signals are transmitted in 
the CATV system as described above, a television receiver 
designed to receive only open air broadcast UHF & VHF 
signals, cannot receive all the channels provided in a CATV 
system. Therefore, a reception terminal (referred to as a 
"cable box"), CBX, provided with a tuner capable of 
receiving the aforementioned number of channels according to 
the type of service contract with a CATV broadcasting 
company is offered to each of the subscribers by leasing or 
buying. Video and audio signals are supplied to the 
television receiver using the cable box. These boxes may be 
incorporated within the structure of a TV receiver. In the CATV system, a flat monthly rate is 
generally paid by a subscriber for broadcast service. The 
monthly rate is generally fixed regardless of the amount of 
programs viewed. So called pay-per-view type pay 
broadcasting provides broadcast programs where a subscriber 
pays a viewing/audience fee each time program material is 
viewed. In each of these systems program material is  
 
typically broadcast in scrambled form so as to prevent 
unauthorized viewing thereof. Authorized viewers are 
generally provided with a de-scrambler for unscrambling the 
scrambled broadcast material. This de-scrambler is 
typically provided in the above mentioned cable box. Information regarding the subscriber's type of 
contract/service preferences is entered into a database in 
the head end, or broadcast side. An ID or code which 
corresponds to the type of contract/services preferences is 
also registered in the database. This ID code is 
transmitted to the cable box during broadcast of a program 
signal to enable the cable box to unscramble the received 
broadcast program signal. There is also known an interactive(
