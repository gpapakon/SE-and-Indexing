<ABSTRACT>
Combinational weighing is carried out firstly by 
calculating combinations of weight signals from a plurality 

of weighing devices (5) each weighing a batch of objects to 
be packaged and selecting a combination having a total 

weight satisfying a specified criterion with respect to a 
target value, and secondly by re-checking the weight 

signals from the weighing devices of the selected 
combination before discharging the objects therefrom. The 

value of the difference (Δ) between the total weights 
obtained at the time of the combinational calculations and 

at the re-checking time is stored cumulatively after each 
cycle of operation, and a new target value is calculated 

and set after each cycle from many stored difference values 
from previous cycles in order to improve the work 

efficiency and the yield at the same time. According to a 
preferred embodiment, the difference between the weight 

values obtained at these two times of measurement is 
cumulatively stored after each cycle for all weighing 

devices and a new target value is calculated by considering 
the distributions of past difference values corresponding 

to the individual weighing devices of the selected 
combination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods of and apparatus for
combinational weighing such that a large number of objects,
such as food items having a desired total weight, can be
packaged inside a bag.For collecting a large number of objects for automatic
packaging, it has been known to weigh the objects separately
in batches by using a plurality of weighing devices and to
make combinations of the weight signals from these weighing
devices. A lower limit value is set, and a target value is
obtained by adding a certain correction value to this lower
limit value. A particular combination with a total weight
close to this target value within a certain allowable range is
selected, and the batches of objects from the selected
combination of weighing devices are discharged into an
automatic packaging machine.In other words, in order to make it absolutely certain that no
merchandise with insufficient weight will be produced, a
target value C is set between a certain specified lower limit
value A and an upper limit value B by adding a certain
specified correction value α to the lower limit value A, as
shown in Fig. 3, and a combination is selected such that its
total weight will not be less than this target value C.
Before the objects are discharged from the selected
combination of weighing devices, however, the total weight is 
checked again by inputting and adding the weight signals from
the selected weighing devices, as disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Publication Tokko 2-54885 (JP-B-2-54 885; EP-A2,3-119 854). The weighed
objects are not discharged if their total weight is found to
be less than the specified lower limit value such that no
merchandise with insufficient weight will be produced.The correction value α is determined in view of the small
variations in the weight signals from the individual weighing
devices, which may be caused by the vibrations of the weighing
devices when objects are dropped onto the associated weigh
hoppers as well as the vibrations of the floor. If a weight
signal is received at time D for combinational calculations
and the total weight of the selected combination is checked at
a later time E, there is likely to be a difference Δ in signal
level between the two points in time D and E, as shown in Fig.
4. The level difference Δ may be positive or negative. If it
is negative, the weight at the time of the re-check may be
less than the lower limit value A, and the discharge of the
objects from the selected combination of weighing devices is
prevented in order to avoid the
