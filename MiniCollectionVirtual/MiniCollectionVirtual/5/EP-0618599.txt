<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a simplified and an 
economical method for preparing small-size and large capacity 
condensers. Explanations are given hereunder about ceramic semiconductor 
condensers of blocking-layer (BL) type and multilayer (ML) type 
condensers being used for small-size and large capacity ones. BL-type condensers are ceramic semiconductor condensers in 
which ceramic grains are segregated each other with highly 
insulating materials formed uniformly on the grain boundary, and 
they are usually prepared by the following method. To a 
dielectric raw material like barium titanate (BaTiO₃), strontium 
titanate (SrTiO₃), calcium titanate (CaTiO₃), etc. is added a 
minute specified amount of an additive including oxides of such 
tri- or hepta-valent metals as La, Dy, Nd, Y, Nb and Ta which is 
necessary for the raw material to be turned to semiconductor; the 
mixture is blended and ground in a ball mill; an organic binder 
like PVA is added thereto; the resulting raw material is 
granulated and molded into shapes desired; and the molded 
material is subjected to a heat-treatment at 1350-1400°C under a 
specified atmosphere to obtain semiconductor ceramics. On the 
surface of the resulted semiconductor ceramics is applied by use 
of a screen, etc. a doping agent composed of a metal oxide (MnO,  
 
CuO, Bi₂O₃, PbO, Tl₂O₃, Sb₂O₃, Fe₂O₃, etc., or mixtures thereof) 
for insulating exclusively and selectively the grain boundary, 
and the doping agent is diffused thermally. In another method, 
the above-mentioned metal oxide is added in the ceramic 
composition and is thermally diffused after the heat-treatment. 
Finally, electrodes are combined with the surface by baking. Other types of large capacity ceramic condensers include 
multilayer-type (ML-type) condensers, which are prepared by the 
following method. The raw material ceramic powder is milled, 
mixed with a binder and turned to sludge; ceramic raw sheets 
(green sheets) are formed therefrom by cast-sheeting; subjecting 
the raw sheet to punching to be shaped to predetermined forms; 
printing inner electrodes; piling and pressing; cutting; 
sintering the piled multilayer raw chips; combining outer 
electrodes by baking or electroplating; fitting lead wires; and 
armored to form a final product. In the preparative method, the sintering and combining of 
inner electrodes are achieved simultaneously, and the sintering 
of raw materials principally composed of barium titanate 
(BaTiO₃), strontium titanate (SrTiO₃) or calcium titanate 
(CaTi
