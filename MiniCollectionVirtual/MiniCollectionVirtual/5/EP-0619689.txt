<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to radiant heaters 
and more specifically to heating coils for use in such 
heaters. Radiant heaters, which generate heat by passing an 
electrical current through a high resistance element, have 
become common place. However, new applications are 
continually being devised. With the dwindling supply of 
fossil fuels and their associated spiralling costs, more 
homes are using electrical radiant heaters as their primary 
or secondary heating source. Portable electric space 
heaters have also seen an increase in popularity. Large 
commercial space heaters for warehouses, garages and the 
like are also more common. Hand dryers, like those found in 
many public restrooms, and hair dryers, which are common in 
the home, also require radiant heater elements. With the 
advent of electrically powered cars, it is expected that 
highly efficient electric heating elements to heat the 
passenger compartment will be needed. The electric current passes through a resistive heating 
element; in one form the heating element is exposed to the 
ambient, and in another form it is protected within a tube 
such as quartz or metal. Quartz heater tubes utilizing high  
 
temperature heating elements are common in the food service, 
graphic arts, and the industrial processing field. 
Applications in which quartz heaters can be found include 
very high speed drying of print, broiling and baking of 
foods in restaurants, drying ceramics and sealing plastics 
(e.g. bag forming processes). Quartz heaters are also 
replacing normal heating elements in stove top ovens. A typical heating tube consists of a high resistance wire 
wrapped in a helical configuration. The respective free 
ends of the helix are connected to a copper or other 
electrically conductive metal that serves as a common 
terminal point for that end. The helically configurative 
element is often suspended within a quartz or metal tube. 
The tube may be capped with ceramic end pieces or caps, and 
the helical heating element is held in tension by the end 
caps. Some quartz heating tubes are vacuum sealed and may contain 
an inert gas. Frequently, special control circuitry is 
required because of an initial in-rush current when these 
devices are first activated. A typical helical heating element may be, for example, from 
three inches to seventy-two inches long and from .250 inch 
to one inch in diameter. Generally, the helical structure  
 
is extended to space each coil from the adjacent coils. The 
wire has a diameter as
