<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packing for a lid
having an oxygen absorbing function, and used to seal a
container opening. A packing for a lid according to the
present invention has high liquid resistance, and thus may be
used to seal various containers, such as a jar or a plastic
bottle, in which juice, liquor, wine, other liquid drinks,
shiokara, tsukudani, jam, marmalade, sake-fureiku or other
foodstuffs containing a high volume of water are contained. A
packing for a lid according to the present invention has
significant effect on the maintenance of the quality of
articles which easily deteriorate with oxygen, or which easily
decay or transform with propagation of microbes. The present
invention also relates to a lid comprising such a packing.Drinks, foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals and the like which
easily deteriorate with the influence of oxygen have a problem
in that they deteriorate because of oxygen contained in a
packaging container when they are stored in a packaging
container. As a means for solving this problem, a step of
removing oxygen within a container has been adopted by using
vacuum packaging or nitrogen substitution treatment when
packaging foodstuffs. However, this method is not simple, and
it is difficult to completely remove oxygen within the 
container. Such method is not necessarily satisfactory in
terms of the maintenance of quality.Recently, so-called "oxygen absorbing agent packaging,"
i. e. a step of enclosing an oxygen absorbing agent within the
packaging container to make use of its significant oxygen
removing effect, is widely used as a reliable and simple
method of removing oxygen. Generally, a method consisting of
enclosing an oxygen absorbing agent formed into a small bag
made of a gas permeable material into a packaging container is
adopted as the oxygen absorbing agent packaging, and at the
same time, various methods of incorporating an oxygen
absorbing agent into a lid portion to seal the container
opening are also proposed. However, when the oxygen absorbing
agent is incorporated into a lid portion, there arises a
problem in a manner of attaching a bag-shape oxygen absorbing
agent because of its form. In order to solve this problem,
various types of packing used to seal a lid with an oxygen
absorbing function have been proposed.For example, in the Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open
Publication No. 57-9746, a packing in which an oxygen absorbing
agent is stored has been proposed. However, because of the
use of a powder type oxygen absorbing agent disclosed in this
Pub
