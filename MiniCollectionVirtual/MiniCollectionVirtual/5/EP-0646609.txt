<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous dispersion of an aqueous polyurethane having an 
ionic functional group, polyoxyethylene units and terminal hydrazine 

functional groups is provided. Content of the ionic functional group is 
about 5 to about 180 milliequivalent per 100 g of the aqueous 

polyurethane, and content of the polyoxyethylene unit is about 20 % by 
weight or less of a weight of the aqueous polyurethane. The aqueous 

dispersion is used for a composition for ink, coating or adhesive. Storage 
stability, water resistance, pigment dispersibility, and adhesion to 

various kinds of substrates, particularly non-polar substrates, of the 
aqueous dispersion and the composition are excellent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aqueous dispersion of a specific
aqueous polyurethane and to a composition containing the aqueous
dispersion. More particularly, the present invention relates to an
aqueous dispersion which is used for an ink, a coating or an adhesive for
metal, wood, paper, leather, glass, fiber, plastic, foamed articles,
concrete and the like and in which storage stability, water-resistance,
pigment dispersibility and adhesion to various substrates are excellent,
and to a composition containing the aqueous dispersion.Dispersing or dissolving a resin used in an ink, a coating or an
adhesive into an aqueous medium has conventionally been achieved by
using a dispersant or an emulsifier or by the action of a dispersing
group, an emulsifying group or a dissolving group (an ionic functional
group and/or a nonionic functional group) contained in the resin. It has
been generally found that the resins of the latter self-emulsifying or self-dissolving
type result in better performance.Aqueous dispersions or solutions of self-emulsifying or self-dissolving
polyurethanes containing ionic functional groups alone have
a drawback in that storage stability and water-resistance are inferior
even though adhesion to substrates and dispersibility of pigments are 
relatively good. Therefore, it was proposed for overcoming the drawback
that nonionic functional groups alone or a combination of nonionic
functional groups and ionic groups should be contained in the resin.As for the adhesion to substrates, an aqueous resin dispersion
having sufficiently satisfactory adhesion to substrates having smooth
surfaces, particularly to non-polar substrates having smooth surfaces
such as plastics, has not been obtained even though aqueous dispersions
having better properties than conventional materials for adhesion to
substrates having porous and rough surfaces such as paper have been
obtained. As the method for improving the above drawback of the
aqueous dispersion, it has heretofore been known that a non-polar
material such as a hydrocarbon compound can be added to the aqueous
dispersion or that a polyurethane in which a hydrocarbon group is
incorporated in the end and/or other parts of the main chain by reaction
of a hydrocarbon compound having monovalent or divalent active
hydrogen with an organic diisocyanate can be used.However, the aqueous dispersions of the polyurethane described
above and the compositions containing the aqueous dispersions have
drawbacks in that dispersibility in water and storage stability
