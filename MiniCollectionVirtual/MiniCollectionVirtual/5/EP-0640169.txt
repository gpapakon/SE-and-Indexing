<ABSTRACT>
In its most simple embodiment, the disclosed glazing element consists of two panes (1, 2) mutually linked by a shaped body (13) made of a textile spacing fabric. The textile spacing fabric allows the panes to be frictionally coupled, thanks to its highly elastic, flexurally stiff transversal threads (16), forming a dimensionally stable and self-supporting plate-shaped body. This plate-shaped body is particularly suitable to form frameless window wings.
