<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a push button 
panel for an elevator. The push button 

panel (1) comprises a front panel (3) and 
push button areas (2) provided on the 

front surface (4) of the front panel. The 
front panel (3) is made of a material 

having a high degree of rigidity. At 
least in the regions of the push button 

areas (2), the back surface (6) of the 
front panel (3) is provided with elements 

(9) sensitive to pressure changes. The 
sensor element (9) is connected by at 

least one signal conductor (8) to the 
data transmission system of the elevator. 

The sensor element (9) preferably consists 
of a film which, when subjected to 

mechanical work, produces an electric 
signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a push button panel for an
elevator as defined in the preamble of claim 1,The calls used to operate an elevator are usually given by
pressing push buttons placed at the landings and in the
elevator cars. The signal issued by a push button is transmitted
directly or after processing to the elevator control
system, which generally returns feedback information concerning
receipt of the call in the form of an indication via
the push button itself or a signalling device placed near
it. This call akcnowledgement signal given as feedback
information is often issued by means of a signal light. In
practical solutions, the push buttons for an elevator can be
implemented in various ways and, in normal conditions and if
properly used, the solutions employed generally work without
problems.In certain elevators and certain situations, incorrect or
even violent treatment of the push buttons becomes a problem.
Deliberate vandalism directed at push buttons or associated
equipment, besides damaging the equipment in question,
may cause disturbances in the whole elevator system.
Such a disturbance is produced e.g. by a damaged landing
call device stuck in a position where it sends a continuous
call signal. Push buttons are also jammed with chewing gum,
sticks, tape etc. so that they remain continuously on. The
structures and materials of conventional push buttons are
seldom designed to withstand abnormal service conditions.There are several known solutions in this field which aim at
solving the problem referred to above and producing push
buttons capable of withstanding rough treatment and
exceptionally difficult service conditions. However, the
existing solutions are expensive and complicated. The object of the invention presented in this patent application
is to achieve a new push button panel which is applicable
for use with an elevator and as insensitive to external
disturbing factors as possible and which still guarantees
a reliable transmission of call signals to the elevator
control system. To accomplish this, the invention is characterized
by the features presented in the characterization
part of claim 1. Other embodiments of the invention are
characterized by the features presented in the subclaims.The push button panel of the invention is completely
insensitive to external disturbing factors in situations
which can be expected in practice. Even using an arm
blanche, a hammer or other striking tool to give a call will
not cause any disturbance in the transmission of calls or in
subs
