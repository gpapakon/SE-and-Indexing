<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the field of
fuel additive compositions and, more specifically, to fuel
additive compositions capable of increasing the efficiency
of combustion systems i.e. continuous combustion systems
(boilers, furnaces etc.) and internal combustion systems
(vehicles etc.) thereby increasing fuel economy, decreasing
the amount of harmful pollutants formed in the combustion
process, reducing the corrosive effects of fuels, and
reducing engine noise and roughness.In recent years, there has been an increased
awareness of the need for greater fuel efficiency and
maximum pollution control from combustion of fossil fuels.
Fuel additives have long been employed to provide a variety
of functions in fuels intended for use in combustion
systems, and have demonstrated varying degrees of
effectiveness. For example, Kaspaul describes in U.S.
Patent No. 4,244,703 the use of diamines, especially
tertiary diamines, with alcohols as fuel additives to
primarily improve the fuel economy of internal combustion
engines. Similarly, Metcalf describes in GB 0990797 the
use of an admixture comprising formaldehyde or polymeric
formaldehyde, a combined acrylic ester and acrylic resin
solution, methylene glycol dimethyl ether, propanediamine,
and butyl-paraphenylene diamine in a carrier or solvent as
a fuel additive primarily intended to improve the fuel
economy of internal combustion engines. The fuel additives
described by Knight in GB 2085468 comprising aliphatic
amines and aliphatic alcohols serve as anti-misting 
additives for aviation fuels while GB 0870725 describes the
use of N-alkyl substituted alkylene diamines as anti-icing
agents. Only a few of those compositions either claimed to
or actually do improve combustion efficiency, but none have
proved completely successful. Furthermore, none of the
known compositions have been able to successfully fill the
need for fuel additives which, when added to fuels, provide
greater fuel efficiency, maximum pollution control, and
reduction of the corrosive effects of fuels on combustion
systems.The need to reduce the amount of harmful
pollutants formed in the combustion process is great. On
complete combustion, hydrocarbons produce carbon dioxide
and water vapor. However, in most combustion systems the
reactions are incomplete, resulting in unburned
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide formation which
constitutes a health hazard. Moreover, particulates may be
emitted as unburned carbon in the form of soot. Sulphur
(S), the major fuel impurity is oxidized to form
