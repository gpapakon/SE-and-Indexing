<ABSTRACT>
In a hover mower the air impeller (15) and the cutting 
blades (9) are driven by separate motors (11,16). Power to the cutting 

blade motor may be supplied through a switch controlling the 
air impeller motor, and a separate switch in series with the 

cutting blade motor enables the cutters to be stopped while 
the air cushion is maintained. The impeller may supply 

cooling air to both motors. The speed of the air impeller 
motor may be separately adjustable.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to grass-mowing machines, and in 
particular to hover mowers, that is to say grass-cutting 
machines of the kind supported, in use, on a cushion of air 
generated by an air impeller and having a cutting member 
including at least one cutter blade mounted for rotation 
about a substantially vertical axis and driven by a prime 
mover which may be an electric motor or an internal 
combustion engine. The air flow produced by the air 
impeller, or a part of that air flow, may also be utilised 
to transfer grass cuttings produced by mowing into a 
collecting box. In electrically-powered hover mowers the cutting member 
and the air impeller are conventionally mounted directly on 
the motor shaft and cutting height adjustment is achieved by 
the insertion of one or more spacing washers above the 
cutting member. When power to the motor is switched off the cutting 
member may, owing to inertia, continue to rotate for some 
time with a risk of injuring the operator. To minimise this 
risk the mower may incorporate a brake, which may be 
mechanical, or it may be electromagnetic or electrical, and 
come into action automatically when the power to or from the 
motor is interrupted. The conventional arrangement in which the cutting 
member and the air impeller are mounted directly on the 
motor shaft imposes certain design limitations, and the 
present invention, which is defined in the appended claims,  
 
is aimed at creating an improved form of mower. This is 
achieved by using separate motors for driving the cutting 
member and the air impeller. preferably, the motors are 
operable independently of each other and may be separately 
controlled. However, in order to avoid damaging the mower 
components and possible injury to a user, it is desirable 
that the cutting member should not be operative in the 
absence of a supporting air cushion, that is, with the mower 
in an "in-use" mode. A mower in accordance with the invention has a number 
of advantages over the conventional arrangement. In conventional hover mowers the speed at which the 
prime mover runs is limited by the maximum practical cutting 
speed, and such a speed is often too low for the impeller to 
operate effectively. Further, when cutting long or dense 
grass, the increased load causes the speed to be reduced, 
resulting in loss of airflow, lowering the hovering height 
and, if collection of cut grass is also a function of the 
mower, reducing the effectiveness of collection. The 
reduction of speed due to increased load has a

A hover mower of the kind described in which an air 
impeller and a cutting member are each independently driven 

by a separate prime mover. 
A mower according to claim 1 wherein at least one prime 
mover is an electric motor. 
A hover mower according to claim 1 in which each prime 
mover is an electric motor and electrical power to the 

cutting member motor is supplied through a switch 
controlling the air impeller motor, so that the cutting 

member is not driven in the absence of a cushion of 
supporting air.
