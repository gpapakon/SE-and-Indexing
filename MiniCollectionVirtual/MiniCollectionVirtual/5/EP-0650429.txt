<ABSTRACT>
Communication devices and communication network techniques are employed to meet safety-critical, operational requirements for train location and control in railroad and public transit applications. On-board (70, 72, 74) and trackside (76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86) communication radios participate in a synchronous, time-slotted communication network, providing contentionless and highly responsive access to all participants. Encrypted, validated, and error protected communication links provide reliable and redundant transfer of information among the train, track-side, and control station (60, 62, 64) radios. Spread spectrum communication techniques enable range measurements between all participants. These wireless communication links relay train range measurements to control or processing stations and relay control information (principally speed commands) from the processing stations (60, 62, 64) to the trains. High resolution position location is determined along elevated, at-grade, and in-tunnel tracks using wireless methods and sparse device placement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for determining
the locations of moving trains and for transmitting
command information to such trains from control stations.As greater metropolitan areas grow larger and people
are commuting greater distances to job centers, public
transportation becomes a more desirable alternative to
commuting in a personal vehicle. The traditional response
in transportation systems to increased usage has been to
increase the amount of infrastructure. However, in light
rail transit systems, adding parallel track lanes to
existing lines is neither cost effective nor typically
possible. Rather, the desirable approach is to increase
the capacity over existing infrastructure without sacrificing
efficiency or safety.Traffic demand is increasing rapidly, but reinforcement
of railway facilities is proceeding slowly. For a
subway system, improving the effectiveness of the transportation
system means minimizing the headway intervals
between two successive trains on the same line. Inherent
in the control process to minimize these intervals is the
accurate, real-time position location of all trains under
conditions with high ambient interference. To satisfy 
these resolution requirements, conventional detection and
signalling methods require placement of sensors and communication
devices at short intervals along the tracks
resulting in expensive installation and maintenance costs.Historically, the safety of railway signalling systems
has been ensured by means of fail-safe electromagnetic
relays. As traffic densities increased, designers of
conventional signalling systems have reluctantly incorporated
more capable fail-safe electronic equipment. However,
conventional signalling systems are now having difficulty
providing train position resolution and rapid control
communication response capabilities which satisfy newer
headway minimization and regenerative braking functions at
an affordable cost.Conventional signalling systems use various combinations
of four different train tracking approaches and three
different levels of on-board automation. In three of these
tracking approaches, tag readers, dead reckoning, and the
Global Positioning System, the train determines its own
position and then reports its position to the control
station. This method supports semi-automatic control in
which each train regulates the interval between it and the
preceding train. In the traditional approach employing
inductive loops, each train's position is determined
directly at the control station. This
