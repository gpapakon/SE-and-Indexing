<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a multi-layer plastic fuel tank 
comprising a high-density polyethylene layer, a modified 

high-density polyethylene layer, a polyamide layer, a modified 
high-density polyethylene layer and a high-density 

polyethylene layer, comprising the step of forming said 
high-density polyethylene layer form a composition obtained by 

blending 20-200 parts by weight of part or whole of said 
multi-layer plastic fuel tank as a regenerated product with 

100 parts by weight of virgin high-density polyethylene, 
wherein said blending is carried out at an extrusion 

temperature of 200-250°C by using a single-screw extruder 
having an L/D ratio of 20 or more and provided with a screw 

constituted by a feed portion, a metering portion for metering 
an extrusion rate, a cross-saw portion for applying a laterial 

shearing force to a resin flow thereby conducting the blending 
of the resin, a deep-screw channel portion in which said resin 

resides, a high-shear portion and an end portion having mixing 
pins in this order from the hopper side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method 
of producing a multi-layer plastic fuel 
tank by forming its high-density polyethylene layer by reusing 
flashes and defective moldings of multi-layer plastic fuel tanks 
as regenerated products. Polyolefin resins are inexpensive and strong, and 
excellent in a weathering resistance and a chemical resistance, 
so that they are widely used for various containers. 
However, the polyolefin resins do not necessarily have sufficient 
gas barrier properties. Accordingly, they cannot be used for fuel 
tanks for gasoline, etc. in countries having strict regulations. In view of the above, various attempts have been 
made to provide thermoplastic resin compositions having 
excellent mechanical strength and gas barrier properties by 
blending polyamides such as nylons having excellent gas barrier 
properties with the polyolefin resins (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Nos. 54-123158, 59-232135, 62-158739, 62-241938 and 62-241941). 
Also, instead of blending, it was proposed to laminate 
polyamide layers and polyolefin resin layers to produce multi-layer 
plastic fuel tanks having improved gas barrier properties 
(Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 55-121017 and Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 60-14695). In this case, since the polyolefin  
 
resin layers generally have a relatively poor bonding strength to 
the polyamide layers, they are laminated via modified plastic 
layers such as those made of polyolefin resins modified with 
unsaturated carboxylic acids or their derivatives. Such multi-layer 
moldings for fuel tanks are generally produced by forming 
parisons by a usual extrusion molding method and then 
subjecting the parisons to blow molding (Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Nos. 58-220738, 62-110526). Japanese Patent Publication No. 60-34461 discloses a 
method of producing a multi-layer, blow-molded container 
constituted by a laminate of a polyolefin resin layer, a polyamide 
or saponified ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer layer and an 
intermediate layer interposed therebetween, the intermediate 
layer being made of a modified ethylene copolymer produced by 
grafting 0.01-1 weight % of maleic anhydride to a copolymer of 
ethylene and an α-olefin having 3 or more carbon atoms and 
showing a crystallinity of 2-30%. However, the polyamide layers of the above multi-layer 
moldings are usually made of polyamide 6, and from the 
viewpoint of moldability of the polyamide layer, the 
temperature of the high-density polyethylene layer (main layer) 
should be higher than that of a
