<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a photographic colour image 
from an imagewise exposed photographic silver halide 

material containing at least one dye image-forming 
colour coupler which comprises the step of treating 

the material with a colour developer composition 
wherein, after colour development, subjecting the 

photographic material to at least one rehalogenating 
bleach and then developing it in a solution capable of 

only developing the rehalogenated silver halide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of forming a 
photographic colour image. It is well known that photographic colour images 
can be obtained by treating an imagewise exposed 
silver halide material containing one or more colour 
couplers with a colour developing solution. Colour 
developing agent oxidised in the presence of silver 
halide development couples with the colour coupler to 
form a dye image. In most such processes the image-bearing silver 
halide material is treated with a bleach solution 
which oxidises the silver image, often back to a 
silver halide, and a fix solution which removes the 
unexposed silver halide and silver salt formed by the 
bleach from the material. A combined bleach/fix 
solution is alternatively used. In the desire to use less silver in photographic 
materials it has been proposed that low silver-containing 
silver halide materials can be processed by 
a redox amplification method whereby the dye is 
produced in the vicinity of very small amounts of 
silver image which acts as a catalyst. There are problems in operating a redox 
amplification system concerned with the stability of 
the solutions used while low silver materials will not 
provide the desired Dmax for the images produced 
without a redox amplification process. The present invention provides a method of 
obtaining colour images using photographic materials  
 
containing less silver than normal but which can 
provide fully satisfactory colour images without 
necessarily using a redox amplification system. In 
some embodiments it allows the use of bleach baths 
based on hydrogen peroxide which is environmentally 
preferable to current widely used bleach baths. The 
use of such bleach baths is not normally possible 
because currently used silver halide levels are too 
high. According to the present invention there is 
provided a method of forming a photographic colour 
image from an imagewise exposed photographic silver 
halide material containing at least one dye image-forming 
colour coupler which comprises the step of 
treating the material with a colour developer 
composition characterised in that the colour developed 
photographic material is subjected to at least one 
rehalogenating bleach followed by a further colour 
development step in which only the rehalogenated 
silver halide is developed. The present invention: 
1. Allows the use of a low silver coating 
weight to form images of normal density without the 
chemical instability problems of a redox amplification 
process. 2. Enables the use of a
