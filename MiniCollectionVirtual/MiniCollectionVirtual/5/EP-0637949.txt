<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the present invention, a method for attaching discrete portions of stretched elastic strands (105) to predetermined isolated portions of disposable absorbent articles (80) having obstructing elements (83) positioned thereon in the areas (56, 58) where the elastic strands (105) are to be unattached to the disposable absorbent article (80), is provided. In a preferred embodiment, discrete portions of a stretched, continuous elastic strands (105) are attached to predetermined isolated portions of a continuous diaper web having obstructing elements (83) positioned thereon in the areas (56, 58) where the continuous elastic strands (105) are to be unattached to the continuous diaper web. A disposable absorbent article made in accordance to the above described method is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of attaching
discrete, stretched elastic strands to predetermined isolated
portions of disposable absorbent product comprising additional
elements positioned thereon in the areas where the elastic strands
are to be unjoined and relaxed, the additional elements being of a
type which may interfere with the relaxing of the elastic strands.
More particularly the invention relates to a method of
continuously attaching elastic strands to such disposable
absorbent products.Method and apparatus for securing one or more elastic ribbons
in a stretched condition to a continuously moving web in the
manufacture of garments and the like is well known in the art.
This may be done either by sewing, by the use of a heat-activated
coating on the elastic or by the use of a separate adhesive. It
is also known that this process can be carried out in such a way
that the elastic is intermittently joined to the moving web.For aesthetic and functional reasons it is frequently
preferred that the stretched elastic strands be intermittently
joined to the moving web and that the individual items severed
from the web be severed in the unjoined areas so that the portion
of the elastic strand which is joined to the individual item will
contract a discrete area of the individual item and the portion of
the elastic strand which is unjoined to the individual item will 
contract or "snap back" and become relaxed, inactive, and
non-functional. This requires that the web be free of anything
that will prevent the unjoined portion of the elastic strand from
contracting or "snapping back" and becoming relaxed, inactive and
non-functional.However, the design of many products will frequently require
the positioning of various elements on the web in the areas where
the elastic is to be unjoined to the web. If the various elements
positioned on the web are of a type which will interfere with the
relaxing of the unadhered areas of the elastic bands, the
aesthetics and functionality of the individual items severed from
the web will be greatly reduced.An example of a product which is required to be contracted in
only a discrete area, is a disposable absorbent article such as a
disposable diaper. It is important that the elastic strands of
the leg cuffs of the disposable diaper, contract only the area of
the leg cuffs and not contract the area of the waist regions. If
the elastic strands of the leg cuffs were to also contract the
area of the waist region, improper fit and increased leakage would
result about

A method for adhering discrete portions of an elastomeric member (105) to a substrate (34,
36), comprising the steps of:


(i) providing a substrate (34, 36),
(ii) providing an elastomeric member (105) in a stretched condition,
(iii) applying an elastic adhesive to said elastomeric member (105)
(iv) intermittently applying a release agent (78) to said elastomeric member (105)
(v) joining said elastomeric member (105) to said substrate (34, 36)

, said method being characterized in that:

(a) said substrate (34, 36) has a first portion and second portion, at least part of said second
portion of said substrate (34, 36) having at least one obstructing element (83) which is

joined thereto in alignment with the portions of the elastomeric member (105) and which
may restrain or interfere with the relaxing of the adhesive-free end portions of said

elastomeric member (105);
(b) said elastomeric member (105) has a first portion and a second portion;
(c) the elastic adhesive is applied to said first portion of said elastomeric member (105);
(d) the release agent (78) is applied to at least said second portion of said elastomeric member
(105);
(e) the elastomeric member (105) is joined to the substrate (34, 36) such that said first portion
of said elastomeric member (105) becomes joined to at least a portion of said first portion of

said substrate (34, 36) and said second portion of said elastomeric member (105) is
disposed essentially on said second portion of said substrate (34, 36), at least part of said

second portion of said elastomeric member (105) superposing said obstructing element
(83); and
(f) the elastomeric member (105) is relaxed such that said first portion of said elastomeric
member (105) contracts said first portion of said substrate (34, 36) and said second portion

of said elastomeric member (105) becomes relaxed inactive and non-functional without
being restrained by said obstructing element (83).
A method according to Claim 1 wherein said step of providing
a substrate comprises providing a substrate (34, 36) which is a

portion of a disposable absorbent article, preferably is a
portion of a disposable sanitary napkin, and more preferably

is a portion of a disposable diaper.
A method according to any of the preceding claims wherein
said step of providing a substrate (34, 36) having at least one

obstructing element (83) positioned thereon, comprises providing a
substrate (34, 36) having two obstructing elements positioned thereon,

and preferably has four obstructing elements positioned
thereon.
A method according to any of the preceding claims wherein
said obstructing element (83) comprises a patch of high friction

material, preferably comprises a layer of construction
adhesive, and more preferably comprises a patch of natural

rubber foam.
A method according to any of the preceding claims wherein the
step of providing an elastomeric member (105) comprises providing

an elastomeric member (105) comprising a single elastomeric strand,
preferably comprising two elastomeric strands, and more

preferably comprising three elastomeric strands.
A method according to any of the preceding claims wherein
said step of applying a release agent (78) comprises

intermittently coating said elastic member (105) with said release
agent (78) and preferably comprises continuously coating said

elastic member (105) with said release agent (78).
A method according to any of the preceding wherein the step
of applying a release agent (78) comprises applying a release

agent (78) which is a petroleum distillate, preferably is a
silicone, and more preferably is a mineral oil. 
A method according to any of the preceding claims wherein the
step of relaxing said elastomeric member (105) comprises severing

said elastomeric member (105).
