<ABSTRACT>
Surgery is performed with a pulsed heat-producing means that selectively heats a region in a specific tissue within a patient destroying the tissue. The pulsed heat-producting means may be a coherent optical source that is guided by laser fiber to the tissue to be destroyed. In another embodiment, the pulsed heat-producing means is a focussed ultrasound transducer which concentrates ultrasonic energy at a focal point within the specific tissue. A magnetic resonance imaging system employing a real-time temperature-sensitive pulse sequence monitors the heated region of the tissue to provide temperature profiles allowing an operator to alter the position and size of the heated region.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to EP-A-0 534 607.The present invention relates to surgery performed by local
heating guided by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and more
particularly to a method and apparatus for performing surgery by
pulsed local heating guided by real-time temperature-sensitive MR
imaging.Conventional MR imaging provides an operator, such as a
surgeon or a radiologist, with internal views of a patient's
anatomy. MR imaging provides excellent contrast between
different tissues and is useful in planning surgical procedures.
Many tissues in a patient such as a tumor, are much more visible
in an MR image than as seen in actual surgery. The tumor can
also be obscured by blood during surgery further reducing
visibility.Experiments on living tissue show that a heated zone above a
critical temperature destroys tissue. This zone increases in size 
with time as the heat is applied to reach a steady state of both temperature and heat
flow. If the maximum temperature is limited, then an area heated to a temperature
exceeding the critical temperature causing destruction of tissue, approaches a
predetermined size.Researchers at Brigham and Womens Hospital, Boston, MA have proposed
treatment of deep lying tumors by laser surgery, as described in "MR Imaging of
Laser-Tissue Interactions", by F.A. Jolesz, A.R. Bleire, P. Jakob, P.W. Ruenzel, K
Hutd, G.J. Jako, Radiology 168:249 (1989).In laser surgery of the brain, a small burr hole is drilled in the skull and a
hollow needle containing an optical fiber is then inserted into the tumor. Optical
energy is passed through the optical fiber and into the tumor heating the tumor.
Lasers guided through fiber optics are potentially very useful for surgery in the
brain, since they allow access (through biopsy needles) to deeply buried pathology
with minimal disruption of intervening tissue. The laser destroys the pathological
tissue through localized heating.A view of the heated region is provided with the use of MR temperature-sensitive
pulse sequences. One known MR temperature-sensitive pulse sequence is
described in U.S. Patent 4,914,608 "In vivo Method for Determining and Imaging
Temperature of an Object/Patient from Diffusion Coefficients 2 5 Obtained by
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance",by Denis LeBihan, Jose Delannoy, and Ronald L.
Levin issued April 3, 1990. This sequence causes full MR images to be created. It is,
therefore, relatively slow, time-consuming and not capable of monitoring quickly
changing temperatures.In focussed ultrasound surgery, acoustic energy
