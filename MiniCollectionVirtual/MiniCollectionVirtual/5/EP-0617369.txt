<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an
I/O (Input/Output) memory card equipped with a memory,
and more particularly to an I/O memory card which
conforms to a JEIDA/PCMCIA (Japan Electronic Industry
Development Association/Personal Computer Memory Card
International Association) standard or a similar
standard.A communications device is known in which a
communications protocol, a network control sequence
and/or a modulation/demodulation program are stored in
a ROM (Read Only Memory) or a RAM (Random Access
Memory). Examples of such communications devices are
those used in a LAN (Local Area Network) and an ISDN
(Integrated Services Digital Network). When such
information necessary to control communications is
revised or modified, it is necessary to update the
contents of the memories built in the communications
devices.Referring to Fig. 1, a ROM 101a provided in a
communications device 101 stores, for example,
information concerning the communications protocol.
When the communications protocol is updated or
modified, the ROM 101a is replaced by a ROM 101a'
storing updated communications protocol. However, in
practice, it is not easy to perform such a replacement.Recently, an I/O card type communications
control device which conforms to the JEIDA/PCMCIA
standard has been developed. Examples of such an I/O
card type communications control device are an I/O card
type modem (modulator and demodulator) and an I/O card 
type LAN.Fig. 1B shows such an I/O card type communications
control device 102, which includes a system ROM 103
provided in a package of an I/O card. The system ROM
103 stores system information concerning a
communications protocol. Since the system ROM 103 is
packaged, it is very difficult to modify or revise the
contents of the ROM 103.For the above reason, normally, a modification or
revision of the design-completed I/O card is not
performed. If a defect has occurred in the
communications control device 102, it is replaced by a
new one.IEEE Spectrum, vol. 29, no. 6, June 1992, N.Y.,
U.S.A. contains an article by D. Sternglass entitled
"The future is in the PC cards". This article surveys
the general state of the art relating to PC cards,
formerly known as PCMCIA cards.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided an I/O memory card
comprising a memory and characterised by:
a plurality of card attribute information blocks,
each card attribute information block defining a
different I/O or memory card function, which
may be performed by the I/O memory card in
