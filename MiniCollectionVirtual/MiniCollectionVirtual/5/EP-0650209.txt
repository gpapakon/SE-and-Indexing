<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the hydrometallurgical treatment of used household and instrument batteries for the recovery of the raw materials, in particular zinc, nickel, cadmium, copper, lithium and manganese, in which the fine powder formed by comminution of the batteries and removal of residues is digested by means of an acid and in this way at least a large part of the constituents of the powder is brought into solution, and in which, after at least one further process step, in each case a metal and/or a metal alloy is separated from the acid-containing metal salt solution by electrolysis. To decrease the capital costs and to keep the consumption of chemicals relatively low and thus to reduce the operating costs, the strongly acid-containing but metal-depleted electrolyte solution is used without separation of the acid from the residual metal content for the digestion of the milled battery powder.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the hydrometallurgical treatment of used domestic and portable
batteries in order to recover the metallic raw materials, in particular zinc, nickel,

cadmium, copper, lithium and manganese, in which the fine powder produced by
comminuting the batteries and separating off waste is decomposed by means of an

acid and then the fraction of the metallic ingredients of the powder soluble in this
acid is extracted, characterised in that the metallic ingredients of the powder

brought into solution are separated from one another by means of separate
extraction stages, that the metal solutions separated in this manner are electrolysed

separately from one another and that the electrolytic solutions with a reduced
content of the respective metals are used after electrolysis, without the acid being

separated from the residual metal content, for the decomposition of the ground
battery powder.
