<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid applicator
comprising:
a liquid reservoir,a tip for applying a liquid contained in the liquid reservoir
to an object, the tip having a rectangular cross-section and
being held by a tip holder, anda coupler for connecting the tip holder to the liquid
reservoir.Moreover, the invention relates to a method for producing
such a liquid applicator.A liquid applicator of this kind which is usable as a writing
tool, a paint applicator, a manicure applicator or a paste
applicator and depending on its use may include ink, paint,
correction ink, manicure or paste as the liquid, is known
from GB-A-451 059,
which represents the prior art as referred to in the preamble of
each of claims 1 and 16.
In this liquid applicator the tip holder
holding the rectangular tip is screwed on the coupler, which
in turn is fixedly secured to a liquid reservoir, so that the
components have a defined, fixed orientation to one another.Fig. 16 shows another kind of a prior art liquid applicator,
which will be described in the following:The illustrated pen includes a cylindrical writing tip 100 of
plastics. Whether the tip is felt or plastic, the feature in
common with the known applicators is that they use a
cylindrial tip. The writing tip 100 is connected to a cylindrical core 101
through which ink is flown from a liquid reservoir to the
writing tip 100. The core 101 is made of liquid permeable
material such as porous substance and a textile bundle. The
writing tip 100 and the core 101 are connected to each other
by means of a tip holder 102 which consists of a thick trunk
portion 105 and a thin branch portion 103. The trunk portion
105 includes an end portion having a large inside diameter
enough to receive the core 101, and the branch portion 103
has an end portion having a large inside diameter big enough
to receive the writing tip 100. The tip holder 102 is
fabricated my machining (cutting). The writing tip 100 is
held in the branch portion 103, and the core 101 is held in
the trunk portion 105 of the tip holder 102.The core 101 secured to the tip holder 102 is inserted in a
bore 108 of the coupler 106. The coupler 106 is secured to a
liquid reservoir (not shown). Ink flows from the reservoir to
the writing tip 100 through the bore 108. The flow of the ink
is controlled by the valve (not shown).In use, the drafters push the writing tip 100 against paper.
The core 101 is thrusted into the bore 108 and opens the
valve (not shown) so as to alow ink to flow to the writing
tip 100 through the
