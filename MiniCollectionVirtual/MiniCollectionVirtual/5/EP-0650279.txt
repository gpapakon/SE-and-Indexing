<ABSTRACT>
In a wireless local area network system (10) including a server (20) and a 
plurality of mobile wireless stations (24) the server (20) maintain a table (22) of 

stations (24) active in the network system (10) and monitors the transmission 
activity of the stations (24). If no activity is detected from a station (24) for a 

predetermined time sends a series of watchdog messages requesting a response 
from that station (24). The stations (24) are battery powered and operate in an 

"AWAKE" state to receive or transmit messages or in a SLEEP state of low 
power consumption. The stations (24) return from the SLEEP state to the 

AWAKE state in time to receive at least one watchdog message, thereby 
avoiding the stations being undesirably logged out from the table (22) of active 

stations (24).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wireless local area network systems.A recent development in the field of local area networks has been the
introduction of wireless communications in such networks. Another
development has been the introduction of portable, battery-operated devices for
use in such networks. Unfortunately, the batteries used for such devices have a
restricted life span, thereby limiting the time for which the portable devices can
be effectively operated.In order to control the operation of local area networks there have been
introduced network operating systems (NOS). A feature of many such NOS
systems is that a record or log of all active stations in he network is maintained
at a central control device such as server. If a station does not show activity for
a certain period, a procedure is followed to determine if the station is still
active. If the station is no longer active, then it is deleted from the table, or
"logged-out", whereby resources such as files which were opened for use by
that station can be closed off.It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for operating a
local area network system which enables the battery power of mobile stations to
be conserved, while having the capability of preventing the stations from being
undesirably logged out of a network operating system.Therefore, according to one aspect of the present invention, there is
provided a method of operating a wireless local area network system having a
mobile station, comprising the steps of: monitoring transmission activity of the
mobile station; if no transmission activity of the mobile station is detected for a
predetermined first time period, transmitting to the mobile station a watchdog
message requesting a response message from the mobile station; operating the
mobile station in a low power mode for a second time period commencing after
transmission activity occurs at the mobile station; and operating the mobile
station in a high power mode for a third time period commencing prior to
transmission of the watchdog message so as to enable transmission by the mobile
station of the response message to the watchdog message. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a local
area network system, comprising: a mobile station; means for monitoring
transmission activity of the mobile station; means for transmitting a watchdog
message requesting a response message from the mobile station if no
transmission activity of the mobile station is detected for a predetermined first
time
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a wireless local area network
system (10,40) having a mobile station (24,48), comprising

the steps of:

monitoring transmission activity of the mobile station;
if no transmission activity of the mobile station (24,46) is

detected for a predetermined first time period, transmitting
to the mobile station a watchdog message requesting a

response message from the mobile station; operating the
mobile station in a low power mode for a second time period

commencing after transmission activity occurs at the mobile
station (24,46); and operating the mobile station in a high

power mode for a third time period commencing prior to
transmission of the watchdog message so as to enable

transmission by the mobile station of the response message
to the watchdog message.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps
of: maintaining at a server (20,42) a record of whether the

mobile station (24,46) is active in the system; and updating
the record in accordance with whether the response message

was transmitted by the mobile station in response to the
watchdog message.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the steps
of: transmitting a series of watchdog messages to the mobile

station (24,46) which are spaced apart in time at periodic
intervals; and operating the mobile station in the high

power mode prior to transmission of a last watchdog message
of the series of watchdog messages. 
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step
of operating the mobile station (24,46) in the high power

mode for a predetermined fourth time period commencing
immediately after transmission or receipt
 of any type of
message by the mobile station.
The method of claim 1, further comprising the step
of transmitting a response message from the mobile station

(24,46) in response to receipt of the watchdog message by
the mobile station.
The method of claim 1, wherein the third time period
is predetermined.
A local area network system (10,40), comprising: a
mobile station (24,46); means for monitoring transmission

activity of the mobile station; means for transmitting a
watchdog message requesting a response message from the

mobile station if no transmission activity of the mobile
station is detected for a predetermined first time period;

means for operating the mobile station in a low power mode
for a second time period commencing after transmission

activity occurs at the mobile station; and means for
operating the mobile station in a high power mode for a

third time period commencing prior to transmission of the
watchdog message so as to enable transmission by the mobile

station of the response message to the watchdog message. 
The system of claim 7, further comprising a server
(20,42) wherein: said server includes a table (22,49) for

maintaining a record of whether the mobile station is active
in the system; and said server updates the table (22,49) in

accordance with whether the response message was transmitted
by the mobile station (24,46) in response to the watchdog

message.

(24,46) includes a transceiver circuit (60) coupled to a

power management circuit (76), and further wherein the power
management circuit (76) operates the transceiver circuit

(60) so that the mobile station operates in the low power
mode for the second time period commencing after

transmission activity occurs at the mobile station.
