<ABSTRACT>
A cellular radio system, having a mobile services switching 
center (MSC) coupled to a base station by means of a pulse 

code modulation (PCM) link, has an apparatus comprising, in 
the MSC, a transcoder and rate adaptor (TRA) that generates a 

PCM frame from a plurality of user data blocks, each user data 
block corresponding to one of a plurality of users and each 

user data block comprising an integer number of bytes of data. 
In the PCM frame, each of the plurality of user data blocks 

occupies an integer number of consecutive bytes of the 
generated PCM frame, which is then output to the PCM link. 

The base station includes a channel encoder that generates an 
air interface frame from a plurality of user data blocks 

contained in a received PCM frame. The base station may also 
generate a timing control signal which is received by the MSC. 

A timing controller in the MSC is responsive to the received 
timing control signal, and causes the TRA to synchronize 

output of a generated PCM frame with generation of an air 
interface frame such that the generated PCM frame will arrive 

at the base station channel encoder substantially just at a 
moment when the generated PCM frame is needed by the channel 

encoder in order to generate the air interface frame without 
waiting for the generated PCM frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to radiotelephone communication systems and more
particularly to a method and apparatus for reducing the delay in transmitting a block
of speech to a mobile station, the delay being associated with the use of time division
multiple access transmission of speech parameters on a pulse code modulation link
between a mobile services switching center and a base station.A cellular telephone communications system may include elements as shown in FIG.
1. Within the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) 100, a base station (BS) 103 is
connected to a mobile services switching center (MSC) 101 by means of a first Pulse
Code Modulation (PCM) link 107. The MSC is then linked to a Public Switched
Telephone Network (PSTN) 115 by means of a second PCM link 113.The MSC 101 has a Group Switch (GS) 111 for properly routing speech between the
PSTN 115 and the appropriate base station
103. The MSC 101 also includes a Transcoder and Rate Adaptor (TRA) 109 which
performs speech coding/decoding (data compression/expansion) and data rate
adaptation of the speech signals that flow between the PSTN 115 and the base station
103. In operation, speech received by the MSC 101 via the second PCM link 113 is
first compressed by the TRA 109, and then transmitted to the base station 103 by
means of the first PCM link 107. This transmission preferably uses the error detection
and handling mechanisms disclosed by commonly owned U.S. Patent Application No.
5,491,719 by A. Molin et al., filed on July 2, 1993. After it is received by the base 
station 103, the encoded speech is relayed to a mobile station
(MS) 105. A speech coder-decoder (codec) (not shown) inside
the mobile station 105 decodes the received speech parameters
as part of the process of generating audible speech.A similar set of operations takes place in the opposite direction.
That is, speech originating in the mobile station 105
is encoded by the codec (not shown) located in the mobile
station 105, and then transmitted to the base station 103.
The encoded speech is then relayed, by means of the first PCM
link 107, to the MSC 101. Inside the MSC 101, the encoded
speech is decoded by the TRA 109, and then forwarded to the
PSTN 115 by means of the GS 111 and the second PCM link 113.The first PCM link 107 transmits data at a rate of 64 kilobits
per second (kbit/s). However, this capacity is effectively
increased by the fact that the speech being conveyed is compressed
(i.e. encoded) as described above. The type of
compression which is used in cellular
