<ABSTRACT>
A test procedure for the testing liquid storage 
tanks, for leakage, comprises: immersing at least part of 

test equipment in the liquid in question and fixing the 
equipment in position with respect to the tank; allowing a 

quantity of the liquid in question to be admitted to a 
multiplier tube, until the level of liquid in the multiplier 

tube equates to that in the tank; isolating the liquid in the 
multiplier tube from that in the tank for an appropriate test 

period; introducing a predetermined measure (M) of liquid of 
the same nature as that in the tank into the test equipment to 

establish a recordable datum level removing the predetermined 
measure (M) of liquid from the test equipment; re-connecting 

the liquid in the multiplier tube with that in the tank; 
waiting a prescribed period of time; taking the same measure 

(M) of liquid and re-introducing this measured amount into the 
test equipment; and observing any fall of the meniscus of 

that measure from the previous datum level, which fall would 
indicate leakage from the tank. The invention also 

includes test equipment (9).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a test procedure for the 
testing of underground or otherwise inaccessible liquid 
storage tanks for leakage, particulary a tank that is not 
readily susceptible to visual inspection, typically a buried 
fuel storage tank of a filling station, and to equipment for 
carrying out this test procedure. Conventionally, fuel storage tanks in the U.K. must, 
by regulation, be tested for leakage at stipulated periods to 
secure a licence for use from the local licensing authority. 
Current legislation in the U.K. requires that if leakage 
should be detected at a rate exceeding 380 millilitres per 
hour, then the tank must be taken out of service, for repair. 
The officially recommended test requires (i) removal of the 
fuel - petrol or diesel - (ii) cleaning the tank, (iii) 
filling the tank with water, (iv) applying an air pressure for 
a prescribed period, (v) thereafter determining any loss of 
pressure, which would indicate leakage, and (vi) removal and 
disposal of the now contaminated water by a licensed operator. 
Consequently, the tank is non-operational for a considerable 
period. With a view to providing an improved technique, and in 
particular one that most advantageously does not require 
removal of the fuel involved, or the wastage and disposal of 
thousands of gallons of contaminated water, various computer 
based methods and apparatus have been evolved, but these are 
understandably relatively expensive and usually require highly 
specialised and trained operatives.  According to a first aspect of the present invention 
there is provided a test procedure for the testing liquid 
storage tanks, for leakage, comprising: 
(1) immersing at least part of test equipment in 
the liquid in question and fixing the equipment in position 
with respect to the tank;  (2) allowing a quantity of the liquid in question 
to be admitted to a multiplier tube, of relatively large 
diameter (e.g. 28 mm), forming part of the test equipment, 
until the level of liquid in the multiplier tube equates to 
that in the tank;  (3) isolating the liquid in the multiplier tube 
from that in the tank for an appropriate test period;  (4) introducing a measure (M) of liquid of the 
same nature as that in the tank into the test equipment to 
establish by the meniscus of that measure a recordable datum 
level within a transparent tube of relatively small diameter 
(e.g. 2 mm) also forming part of the test equipment; (5) removing the predetermined measure (M) of 
liquid from the test equipment; (6)

A test procedure for the testing liquid storage 
tanks, for leakage, comprising: 


(1) immersing at least part of test equipment in the 
liquid in question and fixing the equipment in position with 

respect to the tank; 
(2) allowing a quantity of the liquid in question to 
be admitted to a multiplier tube, of relatively large diameter 

(e.g. 28 mm), forming part of the test equipment, until the 
level of liquid in the multiplier tube equates to that in the 

tank; 
(3) isolating the liquid in the multiplier tube from 
that in the tank for an appropriate test period; 
(4) introducing a measure (M) of liquid of the same 
nature as that in the tank into the test equipment to 

establish by the meniscus of that measure a recordable datum 
level within a transparent tube of relatively small diameter 

(e.g. 2 mm) also forming part of the test equipment; 
(5) removing the predetermined measure (M) of 
liquid from the test equipment; 
(6) re-connecting the liquid in the multiplier tube 
with that in the tank; 
(7) waiting a prescribed period of time; 
(8) taking the same measure (M) as in step (4) of 
liquid of the same nature as that in the tank and re-introducing 

this measure into the test equipment; and 
(9) observing any fall of the meniscus of that 
measure from the datum level established in step (5), which 

 
fall would indicate leakage from the tank 
A test procedure as claimed in Claim 1, effected 
in a zone of reduced free area within the tank. 
A test procedure as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 
2, wherein the tank is over-filled with the liquid involved. 
Test equipment for carrying out the above 
defined test procedure capable of being immersed, at least 

partially, within the liquid of the tank to be tested, 
comprising: 


(a) means to fix the equipment in position; 
(b) multiplier tube; 
(c) valve means to permit, in an open condition, the 
liquid to enter and to rise in the multiplier tube to a 

suitable level, and in a closed condition to isolate the 
liquid within the multiplier tube from that of the tank; 
(d) means to introduce into the test equipment, and 
to remove from the test equipment, the same predetermined 

measure of liquid (M) of the same nature of that in the tank; 
and 
(e) means to enable the user of the equipment to 
establish datum liquid levels of the meniscus of the measure 

(M) to determine the extent of any fall in level, over the 
test period, thus indicating leakage from the storage tank 

being tested. 
Test equipment as claimed in Claim 4, comprising 
a filler tube e.g. of 8 mm internal diameter, to serve as the 

means to introduce the liquid measure (M) with a manually 
operable valve (V1) to connect or isolate the filler tube with 

 
respect to the multiplier tube. 
Test equipment as claimed in Claim 4 or Claim 5, 
wherein the means to establish datum levels preferably 

comprises a transparent tube, which again incorporates a 
manually operable valve. 
Test equipment as claimed in any one of Claims 4 
to 6, wherein a vertically extending scale is provided on the 

equipment, along side the transparent tube, so that meniscus 
levels can be noted and recorded. 
Test equipment as claimed in any one of Claims 4 
to 7, wherein a third tube is provided, again with an 

interposed isolating valve, for temperature compensation.
