<ABSTRACT>
A mobile automatic floor cleaner with integral clean and dirty liquid compartments, with a cleaning rotor to be supplied from the clean liquid compartment and with at least one suction nozzle discharging into the dirty liquid compartment, the clean and dirty liquid compartments being mutually separated by a partition and, in the operative condition, an underpressure in relation to the ambient pressure prevailing in the dirty liquid compartment, is to be improved by giving it a wider radius of action with reliable, blockage-free operation and easy maintenance. This is achieved in that the dirty and clean liquid compartments (7, 6) are fitted with a tightly shut and openable connection (15) which, when open, allows liquid to flow from the dirty into the clean liquid compartment (7, 6).
