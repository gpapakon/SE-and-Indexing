<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the cyclic operation of at least two reactors, wherein, in the reactors through which a raw gas stream flows, there takes place at least one catalytic reaction in which a liquid and/or solid reaction product is formed. The gas here flows through the reactors successively in the flow direction and the reactors are operated at different temperatures. After switching to a subsequent cycle, the reactor through which the gas flowed first in the preceding cycle has the gas flowing through it last in this subsequent cycle. Each reactor is operated at the temperature at which the other reactor was operated in the preceding cycle. According to the invention, a precooling of the one reactor and/or a preheating of the second reactor is carried out in the end phase of a cycle, before the order of flow through the reactors is reversed for changing the cycle. The precooling or preheating prior to the cycle change in the reactors can be carried out by mixing a cooling/heating medium into the raw gas stream (particularly in the case of adiabatically operated catalyst beds) and/or via cooling/heating coils in the reactors (particularly in the case of pseudo-isothermally operated reactors). The process of the invention offers particular advantages in the desulphurisation of a raw gas stream containing at least H2S and optionally SO2, COS and/or CS2 by catalytic reaction of H2S with SO2 and/or O2 to give elemental sulphur and water and optionally by hydrolysis of COS and/or CS2.
