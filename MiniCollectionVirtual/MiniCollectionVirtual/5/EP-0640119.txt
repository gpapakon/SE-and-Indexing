<CLAIMS>
The use of an aqueous dispersion or solution of a cationically 
modified, alkoxysilane-terminated polyurethane obtainable from the 

following components: 

a) an isocyanate having a functionality of more than 1, 
b) a polyol, 
c) a tertiary amine compound containing at least one isocyanate-reactive 
group in such a concentration that the polyurethane can 

be dissolved or dispersed in water after neutralization with acids, 
d) an alkoxysilane corresponding to the general formula 

X-Si(-OR)
y
H
z
,
 
in which 


y = 2 or 3, 
z = 1 or 0, 
H is hydrogen or a C
1-6
 alkyl radical, 
X is an organic radical containing at least one isocyanate-reactive 
group and the R's may be the same or different and represent 

substituents from the following group: hydrogen and C
1-4
, alkyl 
groups, 
 
in a concentration of less than 3.0% by weight, expressed as SiO
3
 
and based on the weight of the polyurethane, 
e) 0 to 20% by weight of a chain-extending agent, based on the 
weight of the polyurethane, and 
f) inorganic or organic acids for establishing a pH value in the range 
from 2.5 to below 6.5 
 
as the basis for a storable contact adhesive. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized by isocyanates having 
a functionality of 2, more particularly aliphatic diisocyanates, for example 

tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate (TMXDI) or isophorone diisocyanate. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized by polyols having  
 

polyester and polyether segments, more particularly with average molecular 
weights MW
n
 in the range from 100 to 8,000, polyether polyols being 
preferred. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized by a concentration of the 
tertiary amine compound of 2 to 200 milliequivalents per 100 g of polyurethane. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the alkoxysilane 
concentration is between 0.1 and 3.0% by weight, expressed as SiO
3
 and 
based on the weight of the polyurethane, and preferably between 0.1 and 

1.3%. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized by chain-extending 
agents from the following group: water, diols and triols having low molecular 

weights of â‰¤ 399. 
The use claimed in claim 1, characterized by the use of the 
following acids: carbonic acid, formic acid, acetic acid or hydrochloric acid, 

more particularly formic acid.
