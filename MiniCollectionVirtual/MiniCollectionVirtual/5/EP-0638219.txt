<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cable television
systems, particularly those having two-way communications
capability with the user.Bandwidth problems have long restricted the ability of
cable television systems to provide information services to
subscribers. Although a coaxial cable system may permit a
cable system operator to provide, for example, 50 television
channels, each 6 MHz wide, with a total bandwidth of 300
MHz, this total bandwidth is insufficient to permit an
arrangement wherein each subscriber may have, in addition to
these 50 channels, an interactive information service that
functions independently of interactive information services
to all other subscribers and provides full color video,
motion typical of movies or television, and sound.The reason for the insufficiency in bandwidth is
apparent on a consideration of the demands on the system.
Typically a subscriber on a cable system obtains information
services over a communication path that starts at the
headend, proceeds over one of typically a number of trunks,
and then over one of a number of feeders, and then over one
of a number of taps. Each feeder may have, for example,
fifty or more subscribers, and each trunk might serve a
hundred or more feeders. The result is that 5000 
subscribers per trunk is not atypical. Thus merely to
provide a private one-way information service, and nothing
else, to each of these 5000 subscribers would require the
trunk to carry 5000 different signals, each using about 6
MHz of bandwidth, and would alone require a trunk bandwidth
of 30 GHz, which is nearly two orders of magnitude greater
than provided by a typical coaxial cable system.The use of fiber optic trunks can assist in providing
additional bandwidth, but to the extent that coaxial cable
secondary trunks and feeders are used in a hybrid fiber-cable
system, bandwidth limitations may continue to pose
problems. While video compression schemes may assist in
bringing the bandwidth requirements within more practical
limits, each subscriber would then need to be provided with
his own decompression unit.Another problem lies in how to handle the switching and
computing demands on the headend to provide separate and
private information service to potentially hundreds of
thousands of subscribers simultaneously.In one paper, it has been suggested that a portion of
cable system bandwidth be used to provide the most popular
channels universally to all subscribers and remaining
services be delivered to individual busses on a demand
basis only. Large, D.,
