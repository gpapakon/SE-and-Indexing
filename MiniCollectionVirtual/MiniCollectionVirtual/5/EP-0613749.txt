<ABSTRACT>
A welding system for superhigh purity gas supply pipe system, capable of removing easily and completely the metals deposited, 
during the installation of the superhigh purity gas pipe system, on the outer surfaces of the portions of the pipes which are 

closed to the portions to be welded thereof and on the inner portions of these pipes, and capable of setting up a superhigh purity 
gas supply system in a short period of time. A welding system for the gas supply pipe system in which a plurality of members are 

connected together by welding, characterized in that a first member to be welded (113) is provided with a means for supplying an 
inert gas or a welding back seal gas and a means for supplying superpure water, a second member to be welded (114) being provided 

with a means for discharging the inert gas or back seal gas and a means for discharging the superpure water, the first and 
second members being welded as the inert gas or back seal gas is being supplied, the superpure water being supplied after the 

welding of these members has been completed, whereby the metal fume deposited on the surfaces of the welded members during 
the welding thereof can be washed out.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a welding system for 
super high purity fluid supply pipe systems, and in 
particular, relates to a welding system for super high 
purity gas supply pipe systems which is capable of reducing 
the installation costs of supply systems and the like for 
super high purity gasses, pure water, chemicals, or the 
like, which are required for manufacturing apparatuses for 
high performance semiconductor devices and the like, and 
which is capable of a rapid high performance setup after 
installation. Tungsten-inert gas welding, arc gas welding, beam 
welding, and the like, are widely employed as methods of 
connecting pipes and fluid parts, such as valves, 
regulators, and the like, which are employed in fluid 
supply pipe systems. However, in this conventional welding 
technology, the surface roughness of the welded portions, 
and the deposition of metal on the inner surfaces of supply 
system pipes as a result of metal fumes released from the 
fused portion, have not been considered. In particular, in 
conventional gas supply pipes or parts having welded 
portions, no treatment was made with respect to the  
 
deposition of metal fumes generated by welding on the inner 
surfaces of supply system pipes, so that on contact with 
extremely active special material gasses, these deposited 
metals tended to corrode and be separated. As a result, 
the use points, such as semiconductor manufacturing devices 
and the like, which employed gasses were subject to metal 
contamination, and this has been recognized as an important 
factor blocking an increase in performance of such 
semiconductor devices. Furthermore, while no problems 
occurred over short periods of time with respect to inert 
common gasses, it has been discovered by the present 
inventors that there are some problems with reliability 
over longer periods. The deposition of metal fumes as a result of the 
welding of fluid and gas supply pipe systems, and the 
surface roughness of the welded portions, will be explained 
in greater detail using Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows welded 
portions in which pipe materials are welded by means of 
tungsten-inert gas welding. In the figure, reference 401 
indicates a tungsten electrode, while reference 402 
indicates pipe materials which are subjected to welding. 
Reference 403 indicates a welded portion, while reference 
404 indicates metal fumes which are released from the fused 
portion. These metal fumes 404 are carried by the arc gas 
or back seal gas flow and are deposited on the surface
