<ABSTRACT>
In the case of the cashier's desk described, the articles which have been paid for pass with the aid of a conveyor belt (5) into a receiving enclosure (6) which is designed wider than the conveyor belt (5) and projects laterally and in the longitudinal direction with respect to the conveyor belt (5) on the side facing away from the customer passageway. For better distribution of the articles, at the end of the conveyor belt the deflection roller (13) of the belt and a triangular end portion of a belt-supporting plate underneath the upper strand are designed in a manner inclined towards the projecting region of the receiving enclosure (6). Further, roller mats (11, 12) which have rollers extending parallel to the conveying direction of the conveyor belt (5) and slope towards the protruding portion of the receiving enclosure (6) are disposed in the receiving enclosure (6) as a base. In this way, the arriving articles are gradually distributed over the entire area of the receiving enclosure (6). A pivotable deflection strip can thus be dispensed with.
