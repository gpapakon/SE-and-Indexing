<ABSTRACT>
2'-Deoxy-2'-fluorocoformycin and 2'-deoxy-8-epi-2'-fluorocoformycin have now been synthesized by a multistage reaction 
via 3,5-di-O-benzoyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α- and -β-D-ribofuranosyl bromide. Also 2'-deoxy-2'-epi-2'-fluorocoformycin and 2'-deoxy-8,2'-diepi-2'-fluorocoformycin 

have been synthesized from 3,5-di-O-benzoyl-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α-D-arabinofuranosyl bromide 
by 
a multistage reaction. These four 2'-fluorocoformycin derivatives are novel compounds and have a potent enzyme inhibiting 
activity against adenosine deaminase. In particular, they are useful for treating acute lymphocytic leukemia in virtue of the 

above activity. Other novel compounds also obtained include various intermediates useful for the synthesis of the above derivatives.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocoformycin 
and stereoisomers thereof as novel compounds which 
are of low toxicity, possess strong enzyme-inhibitory 
activities against adenosine deaminase, exhibit antitumor 
activities useful for therapeutic treatments of lymphocytic 
leukemias and lymphomas and also exhibit antibacterial 
activities against gram-negative bacteria in 
the presence of formycin A. This invention further relates to a 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α,β-D-ribofuranosyl 
halide and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α,β-D-ribofuranosyl 
or -arabinofuranosyl azide, all of 
which are useful as novel intermediates for the synthesis 
of 2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocoformycin or stereoisomers thereof, 
and also this invention relates to 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-α,β-D-ribofuranosyl 
or -arabinofuranosyl amine which is 
useful as an intermediate and as an antibacterial agent. This invention further relates to 5-amino-1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-ribofuranosyl 
or -arabinofuranosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylic 
acid and 3-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-ribofuranosyl 
or -arabinofuranosyl)-6,7-dihydroimidazo[4,5-d][1,3]diazepin-8(3H)-one, 
all of which are useful 
novel intermediate compounds.  
 Adenosine deaminase is an enzyme which is widely 
present invivo in mammals and which parcipitates in the 
conversion of adenosine to inosine in the course of the 
synthesis of purine and in salvage pathway. Adenosine 
deaminase is known to exist predominantly in lymphocytic 
cells. Coformycin possesses an activity inhibitory to 
adenosine deaminase enzymes and is known as an antibiotic 
of nucleoside-type which is capable of enhancing the 
activity of formycin A having an antitumor activity [see, 
for example, the specification of Japanese Patent 
Publication Sho-45-12278 and "The Journal of Antibiotics" 
A20, p.227(1967)]. Further, coformycin exhibits an 
antibacterial activity in the presence of formycin A. 
However, coformycin has such drawback that it is unstable 
in its aqueous solution under acidic conditions (see the 
specifications of Japanese Patent Publication Sho-60-992 
and U.S. Patent No. 4,151,374). Also known are 2'-deoxycoformycin (another name; 
pentostatin) and 2'-chloropentostatin as analogous 
compounds of coformycin which have the same molecular 
skeleton as that of coformycin [see, for example, U.S. 
Patent No. 4,713,372, German Patent No. 2,517,596, "J. 
Org. Chem." 50, pp.1651-1656(1985) and "The Journal of  
 
Antibiotics" Vol.XXXVIII, No. 10, pp.1344-1349 (Oct. 
1985)]. EP-0 156 524 discloses 2'-chloropentostatin, its adenosine 
deaminase
