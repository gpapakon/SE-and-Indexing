<ABSTRACT>
A probe (10, 110) for measuring fluid velocity 
through a conduit (61, 161) has a pitot tube (1, 101) 

connected to a multiple channel cylindrical conduit (14, 
114) which is placed within a tubular housing (12, 112), 

Drive motors are provided to permit precise rotation and 
longitudinal movement of the cylindrical conduit (14, 

141) and attached pitot tube (1, 101) in the conduit (61, 
161), typically a stack or duct. At least one 

differential pressure gauge is connected to the 
cylindrical conduit (14, 114). A computer (30) directs 

movement of the cylindrical conduit (14, 114), receives 
differential pressure and static pressure readings from 

the differential pressure gauge and utilizes that data to 
calculate flow of the fluid through the conduit. The 

device is particularly useful for measuring stack gas 
flow which flow can be utilized to determine emissions of 

pollutants.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for measuring stack gas velocity and volumetric flow rate 
which is useful for emissions monitoring. The federal government of the United States has 
promulgated test methods in 40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A 
for determining stack gas velocity and volumetric flow 
rate. If one knows the flow rate and has another monitor 
which measures the concentration of pollutants in a 
selected volume of fluid one can calculate the quality of 
pollutants emitted over any selected time period. 
Accordingly, the methods have been used in various ways, 
including the verification of the performance of 
continuous emission monitoring equipment required by 
other rules. The United States has additional regulatory 
requirements in the form of 40 CFR, Parts 72 through 75 
(acid rain reduction), which utilize the Appendix A 
methods. Some recent regulations now require many  
 
electric utilities to continuously measure emissions of 
specified pollutants on a mass per unit time basis. 
Adoption of these rules has put a new importance on the 
errors in both the continuous monitor and in the 
referenced test methods. The new regulations give 
monetary value in the form of trading credits to a ton of 
SO₂ emissions. The value of such emissions is such that 
for large utilities as much as $1,000,000 per percent 
error in measured emissions may result. The methods of Appendix A were introduced into 
law over 20 years ago. They, in general, use simple 
laboratory apparatus and techniques to make the various 
measurements. Unfortunately, the methods are error prone 
and tests under the same conditions often yield different 
results. There are many sources of error related to the 
care, speed and experience of the personnel performing 
the method as well as variability of the test hardware 
itself. In addition, the method makes compromises for 
practical reasons which further expand the margin of 
error. Over the years, the need to reduce the errors in 
these methods have been the subject of much discussion 
and little action. Appendix A of Title 40 of the United States Code 
of Federal Regulations contains two methods for measuring 
flow which are used to determine compliance with emission 
regulations. These methods, known as EPA methods 1 and  
 
2, have gained prominence because they are used to 
determine the proper location, as well to verify the 
performance of continuous measuring flow monitors. 
Errors in method 2 data can be very costly to both the 
supplier of the monitor and
