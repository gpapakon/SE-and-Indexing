<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a topical liposomal formulation comprising piroxicam, a 
phospholipid, a solvent system for piroxicam and said phospholipid, water and 
conventional auxiliary formulating agents, and a method of preparing said formulation. JP-61/172,833 discloses formulations comprising non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
such as indomethacin and piroxicam, with phospholipids. Said compositions are not 
made up of liposomes, however. 
EP-0,249,561 and EP-0,260,241 disclose particular liposomal formulations for systemic 
administration of active ingredients, including piroxicam. 
EP-0,253,619 describes a convenient method for preparing single bilayered liposomes 
containing encapsulated active ingredients. Piroxicam is an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic drug which is sparingly 
soluble in aqueous an/or alcoholic media. This property considerably hampers the 
development of effective topical piroxicam formulations. Classic topical formulations 
usually comprise a rather large amount of piroxicam, mostly dispersed, in order to 
deliver a sufficient amount of the active ingredient to the area that is treated. The 
problem has now been solved by using an especially designed organic solvent system. The present liposomal piroxicam formulation penetrates rapidly and deeply in epithelial 
tissues and shows excellent retention of the active ingredient therein. The efficacy of the 
composition is similar to that of classic cream formulations wherein piroxicam is 
dispersed, although the concentration of piroxicam in the present formulations often is 
considerably lower than the concentration of piroxicam in said classic cream 
formulations. The present formulation is stable and in particular does not show the 
disadvantage of crystallization of the sparingly soluble active ingredient piroxicam. The present invention provides a topical liposomal formulation comprising piroxicam, a 
phospholipid, a solvent system for piroxicam and said phospholipid, water and  
 
conventional auxiliary formulating agents, characterized in that said composition 
comprises as a solvent system dimethylisosorbide and tetraglycol. 
The use of said solvent system in topical liposomal formulations is novel. The present composition is preferably in the form of single bilayered liposomes, in 
particular liposomes having a sizing ranging from 100 to 1000 nm, more in particular from 
100 to 500 nm. In general, the stability of the liposomal formulation increases as the 
size of the single bilayered liposomes

<CLAIMS>
A topical liposomal composition comprising piroxicam, a phospholipid, a solvent 
system for piroxicam and said phospholipid, water and conventional auxiliary 

formulating agents, 
characterized in that
 said composition comprises as a solvent system 
dimethylisosorbide and tetraglycol. 
A composition according to claim 1 wherein the liposomes are single bilayered 
liposomes. 
A composition according to claim 2 wherein the phospholipid is lecithin. 
A composition according to claim 3 wherein the amount of dimethylisosorbide and 
tetraglycol ranges from 8 to 30% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. 
A composition according to claim 4 wherein the ratio of the amount of 
dimethylisosorbide to the amount of tetraglycol ranges from 2:1 to 1:3. 
A composition according to claim 1 comprising by weight based on the total weight 
of the composition : 


(a) 0.1 to 0.6% piroxicam; 
(b) 10 to 30% phospholipid; 
(c) 0.5 to 8% cholesterol; 
(d) 3 to 10% dimethylisosorbide; 
(e) 5 to 20% tetraglycol; 
(f) buffer to maintain the pH of the composition within the range of 5 to 7; 
(g) sufficient electrolytes to stabilize the liposomal membranes; 
(h) sufficient dermatologically acceptable preservatives to prevent degradation of the 
composition; 
(i) 0.5 to 1.5% thickening agent; and 
(j) water. 
A composition according to claim 6 wherein
 
the amount of piroxicam is 0.4 to 0.5%;
 
the amount of phospholipid is 15 to 25%;
 
the amount of cholesterol is 1.5% to 4%;
 
the amount of dimethylisosorbide is 3 to 7%;
 
the amount of tetraglycol is 5 to 15%; and
 
the amount of thickening agent is 1.5%.  

 
A composition according to claim 7 comprising approximately; 

(a) 0.5% piroxicam; 
(b) 20% phospholipid; 
(c) 2% cholesterol; 
(d) 5% dimethylisosorbide; 
(e) 10% tetraglycol; 
(f) 0.06% sodium hydroxide and 0.1% citric acid; 
(g) 0.1% sodium chloride; 
(h) 0.2% methylparaben, 0.02% propylparaben, 0.01% butylated hydroxytoluene, and 
0.15% disodium edetate; 
(i) 1.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose; and 
(j) water. 
A process for preparing a composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 
characterized in that said process comprises the steps of : 


(a) heating the phosholipid and the organic solvent system in a first vessel, dissolving 
the active ingredient therein, adding thereto the auxiliary formulating agents, and 

stirring until complete dissolution is obtained; 
(b) heating part of the water in a second vessel, dissolving the preservatives therein, 
allowing the mixture to cool and then adding the remainder of the auxiliary 

formulating agents and the remainder of the water, and stirring until complete 
dissolution
 is obtained, thus preparing the aqueous component: 
(c) transferring the contents of the first vessel by means of a vacuum directly into the 
aqueous component, while homogenizing with a high performance mixer; and 
(d) adding a thickener to the resulting mixture by means of a vacuum while further 
homogenizing.
