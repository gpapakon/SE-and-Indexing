<ABSTRACT>
In a device for transporting in the plastic state substances 
with a high coefficient of friction via a pipe (10) in which the 

substances and the pipe (10) are caused to vibrate relative to 
one another by means of one or more vibration generators, the 

vibrations are transmitted to the above-mentioned pipe (10). 
Each of the generators (5) can transmit the vibrations to a 
fluid contained in chambers (7) that are arranged coaxially with 

and outside of the pipe (10), with the fluid being in contact 
with the pipe itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for transporting in the
plastic state substances with a high coefficient of sliding
and/or internal friction along a conveyor pipe according to the
precharacterising part of claim 1. A device of this kind is
known from e.g. DD-A-134 052.In the present state of the art, some devices are known
which, in order to facilitate transport as mentioned above via
the above-mentioned pipes in their final leg before reaching the
discharge nozzle and through the above-mentioned nozzle, use
sonotrodes or similar devices to induce vibrations in order to
take advantage of any thixotropic behavior that may exist in the
substance that is being transported, transmitting high-frequency
vibrations directly to said substance.In a known case
the substance is a ceramic in the liquid
state.The problems that are not solved by these types of devices
are mainly the following: first, because the temperature of most
molten substances is very high, the sonotrode is quickly worn 
down since cavitation phenomena in its molecular structure are
aggravated and accelerated.Second, in the segments of pipe that are further away from
the discharge nozzle, [such device do] not help to reduce the
resistance of the substances to flowing along the pipe itself,
and the concept of using more sonotrodes that penetrate into the
substance after going through the walls of the pipe involves
complications that make this approach impractical from both the
engineering and economic standpoints.It should be pointed out that this type of problem exists in
many marketing sectors, including very remote ones [this may be a
typo for "very different ones"].For example, in preparing portions of butter for packaging
in the "continuous" mode, the method used is to heat the surface
of the mass of the butter flowing inside the pipes in order to
reduce the coefficient of friction, but raising the temperature
in this way obviously does nothing to improve the organoleptic
and microbiological properties of the product.Another case where a high coefficient of friction turns out
to be an insurmountable obstacle is that of the molding of
plastics having optimal physical and mechanical characteristics
that make it advantageous to use them in large-scale industrial
production.Such substances, which would first be melted and then
injected into molds, cannot be used because it is virtually
impossible, or at least too complicated and expensive, to make
them flow, even in the plastic state after they are melted, via 
the pipes that carry them to

<CLAIMS>
Device for transporting in the plastic state substances with a high
coefficient of sliding and/or internal friction along a conveyor pipe

(10, 210), wherein one or more vibration generator/s (5, 25) is/are used to
cause the substances and the pipe (10, 210) to vibrate relative to one

another in order to take advantage of any thixotropic behavior that may
exist in the substances themselves, and the above-mentioned vibrations

are transmitted only to the above-mentioned pipe (10, 210) characterized
by that the one or more vibration generator/s is/are immersed within a fluid (8, 28) to

which they transmit the vibrations and that is contained in one or more
chambers (7, 27) that are arranged outside the pipe itself (10, 210),

the above-mentioned fluid (8, 28) being in contact with this latter.
Device according to claim 1 in which the above-mentioned chambers (7,
27) are ring-shaped and are arranged coaxially outside the

above-mentioned pipe (10, 210).
Device according to one of claims 1 or 2 in which the one or more vibration
generator/s (5, 25) is/are generator-converters, each of which is

equipped with a sonotrode (6, 26) located inside the corresponding
chamber (7, 27) that holds the above-mentioned fluid (8, 28).
Device according to one of claims 1, 2 or 3 in which the
above-mentioned fluid (8, 28) is kept at a preset temperature and

transfers its heat to the above-mentioned pipe (10, 210).
Device according to claim 4, in which at the outlet of the pipe (10,
210) is a mold (9, 29) that is filled with the substances that emerge

from the pipe (10, 210), with another vibration generator (5a, 25a) also
being used on the mold itself (9, 29).
Device according to one of claims 1-5, in which the fluid is mercury. 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which each
sonotrode is subjected to an ion-implantation procedure in order to

limit the cavitation phenomenon caused by the vibration of the material
comprising the sonotrode.
