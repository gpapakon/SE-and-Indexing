<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to bioavailable sustained-release 
pharmaceutical formulations of analgesic 
drugs, in particular opioid analgesics, which provide an 
extended duration of effect when orally administered. It is known in the pharmaceutical art to prepare 
compositions which provide for controlled (slow) release of 
pharmacologically active substances contained in the 
compositions after oral administration to humans and 
animals. Such slow release compositions are used to delay 
absorption of a medicament until it has reached certain 
portions of the alimentary tract. Such sustained-release 
of a medicament in the alimentary tract further maintains 
a desired concentration of said medicament in the blood 
stream for a longer duration than would occur if conventional 
rapid release dosage forms are administered. Slow release formulations known in the art include 
specially coated pellets, coated tablets and capsules 
wherein the slow release of the active medicament is 
brought about through selective breakdown of the coating of 
the preparation or through compounding with a special 
matrix to affect the release of a drug. Some slow release 
formulations provide for related sequential release of a 
single dose of an active compound at predetermined periods 
after administration. It is the intent of all sustained-release preparations 
to provide a longer period of pharmacologic response after 
the administration of the drug and is ordinarily experienced 
after the administration of the rapid release dosage 
forms. Such longer periods of response provide for many 
inherent therapeutic benefits that are not achieved with 
corresponding short acting, immediate release preparations. 
This is especially true in the treatment of cancer patients 
or other patients in need of treatment for the alleviation  
 
of moderate to severe pain, where blood levels of an opioid 
analgesic medicament must be maintained at a therapeutically 
effective level to provide pain relief. Unless conventional 
rapid acting drug therapy is carefully administered 
at frequent intervals to maintain effective steady 
state blood levels of the drug, peaks and valleys in the 
blood level of the active drug occur because of the rapid 
absorption, systemic excretion of the compound and through 
metabolic inactivation, thereby producing special problems 
in maintenance of analgesic efficacy. The prior art teaching of the preparation and use of 
compositions providing the sustained-release of an active 
compound from a carrier is
