<ABSTRACT>
A room temperature curable rubber composition of a 
condensation curing type that comprises as a base polymer a 

diorganopolysiloxane or a polyoxyalkylene in which both 
ends of the molecular chain are blocked with a hydrolyzable 

silyl group, and a β-dicarbonyl compound and an amino group 
containing organic compound that are bl
ended with the base 
polymer. Since the room temperature curable rubber 

composition is cured with water in the air and at the same 
time the dehydration condensation of the β-carbonyl group 

and the amino group produces water in the composition, the 
quick curability and deep curability are improved 

remarkably. In addition, since this dehydration 
condensation reaction is an irreversible reaction, the 

product produced by the condensation dehydration is 
hydrolyzed to prevent the amino group containing compound 

from being regenerated, and as a result the hydrophilic 
nature of the cured product is prevented from increasing 

not to damage the water resistance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a room temperature
quick curable composition in which as a base polymer a
diorganopolysiloxane or a polyoxyalkylene polymer is used,
and more particularly to a room temperature quick curable
composition of a condensation curable type that is
excellent in quick curability, deep curability, and water
resistance.As room temperature quick curable compositions of a
condensation curable type in which an organopolysiloxane or
a polyoxyalkylene polymer is used as a base polymer, a one-liquid
type composition wherein the amount of a
crosslinking agent to be added for the base polymer is
minimized to improve the rate of the crosslinking by
hydrolysis and a two-liquid type composition wherein a
crosslinking agent and a curing agent are packed separately
are conventionally known.However, the above one-liquid type composition is
only quick in curing speed from the surface and a certain
period of time is required to allow deep part to be cured,
so that it is hardly said that the one-liquid type
composition is quickly curable. On the other hand
although the above two-liquid type composition is
relatively excellent in deep curability, the two-liquid 
type composition has the defects that because the mixing
ratio of the two liquids is not 1 : 1, the handling is
troublesome and it is difficult to be suitably used, for
example, by an automatic mixer. Further, to attain the
curing completely in deep part, it is required that the
amounts of the hydroxy groups at both ends of the base
polymer and the crosslinking agent to be added are strictly
prescribed or that water is added as a curing agent for
deep part.On the other hand, in the organopolysiloxane
composition of an addition curable type, since the mixing
ratio of the two liquids is 1 : 1, the workability is
excellent, but generally a heating oven is needed for the
curing. Further, since the curing catalyst is poisoned in
the presence of an addition poison, the working atmosphere
is restricted disadvantageously.The present inventors previously suggested a room
temperature quick curable composition that solved the above
problems (Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication
(KOKAI) No. 5-279570). This composition comprises a
diorganopolysiloxane or a polyoxyalkylene polymer wherein
both ends of the molecular chain are blocked with a
hydrolyzable silyl group, an organic compound having at
least one C=O group in the molecule, and an organic
compound having at least one NH2 group in the molecule and
is improved in quick curability at room
