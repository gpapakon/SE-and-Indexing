<ABSTRACT>
A low-loss RF coupler for testing a cellular telephone 
through the antenna mount (13) has a base (10) with a 

hole (12) large enough to fit over said antenna mount (13) 
and a ground plane (16) extending over a surface of the 

base (10). The hole (12) has a contact portion (20) which 
is electrically isolated from the ground plane (16) by an 

airgap (22). A pair of transmission lines (26,28) is 
provided, one (26) having a signal portion electrically 

connected from the contact portion (20) to the test 
equipment and the other (28) having a ground portion 

electrically connected from the ground plane (16) to the 
test equipment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to a coupling device 
and more particularly to a coupling device for linking a 
cellular telephone antenna mount on an automobile with 
equipment for testing the operation of cellular telephones. Because automobile manufacturers are now installing 
cellular telephones into vehicles on the assembly line, a 
need exists to quickly and accurately test the integrity of 
the installed telephone. Antenna whips for the phones are 
typically mounted to an antenna coupling element located on 
the outside of the rear window. However, it would be 
desirable to defer installation of the antenna whips until 
after the vehicles are transported to the point of sale. 
Therefore, telephone testing is preferably performed without 
antennas. Test equipment has been developed to test the 
integrity of the cellular telephone by directly coupling to 
the antenna coupling element. Methods used to connect to 
the antenna coupling element include alligator clips or 
screw-on connectors. However, these methods of connecting 
test equipment have proven to give nonrepeatable results 
because they are susceptible to interference from machinery 
in the plant, the position of the connecting wire, and 
sensitivity to nearby human bodies. Furthermore, using a 
screw-on connector also has the problem of being time 
consuming to install. It would be desirable to have a method of quickly 
connecting test equipment to obtain repeatable and accurate 
test results. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a 
coupling device to be used in the testing of cellular 
telephones which exhibits low loss and provides repeatable 
results. It is also an object of the invention to provide a 
coupling device which is easily placed on the antenna 
coupling element and to provide a good contact between the 
antenna coupling element and the coupler.  Briefly, a preferred embodiment of the present 
invention includes a planar base having a hole large enough 
to fit over the antenna coupling element and a ground plane 
extending over a surface of the base. A contact extending 
within a portion of the hole is electrically isolated from 
the ground plane by an airgap. A pair of transmission lines 
connects the coupler to test equipment, one having a signal 
portion electrically connected from the contact portion and 
the other having a ground portion electrically connected to 
the ground plane. The coupler enbodying the invention the advantages of 
easy use and high durability because there are no moving 
parts. The
