<ABSTRACT>
A gas flow network in combination with a highly 
turbocharged diesel engine (11) for the blending of 

either EGR gas or blow-by gas from the crankcase vent 
with fresh charge air. In the diesel engine assembly 

which incorporates the flow network (10) for EGR gas, a 
venturi (19) is positioned between the intake manifold 

(17) and aftercooler (14) is connected to a flow line 
(16) carrying the EGR gas. In a related arrangement a 

control valve may be utilized to govern the availability 
of EGR. When the turbocharged diesel engine (11) 

assembly is configured with a flow path for blow-by gas, 
the venturi (19) is positioned between the intake 

manifold (17) and aftercooler (14) and is connected to 
a flow line (16) carrying blow-by gas. These systems 

utilise a low static pressure at the narrow throat of the 
venturi (19) so as to induce the flow of EGR gas or blow-by 

gas into the fresh charge air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the routing 
and flow path for recirculating exhaust gas and the routing 
and flow path for blow-by (crankcase vent) gas. More 
specifically the present invention relates to the use of 
venturi designs in the flow paths to introduce the particular 
gases into the intake manifold in a mix with fresh charge air 
from the turbocharger. At the present time blow-by (crankcase vent) gas of 
medium and heavy duty diesel engines is typically vented to 
the atmosphere. However, it is expected that in the near 
future environmental/emissions legislation will mandate that 
this gas be recirculated into the fresh charge air. The 
expected legislation will likely be similar if not the same 
as what is now in effect for gasoline engines and light duty 
diesel engines. In anticipation of such legislation, some thought must be 
given to where and how such blow-by gas can be integrated 
into the air/gas flow network. One option, routing the 
blow-by gas in front of the compressor of the turbocharger is 
not desirable due to fouling of the wheel and aftercooler by 
oily deposits and other particulate matter. In one embodiment of the present invention a venturi is 
placed in the flow path downstream of the aftercooler so as 
to induce the flow of blow-by gas into the fresh charge air. 
The induced flow is created by having a low enough static 
pressure at the throat of the venturi. Several venturi 
designs are disclosed, each of which is suitable for the 
present invention.  A related gas flow arrangement which is applicable to 
diesel engine design is exhaust gas recirculation or EGR as 
it is abbreviated. A variety of exhaust gas recirculation 
systems are known to exist and a representative sampling of 
such systems is provided by the listing of United States 
patent references which are set forth hereinafter. One application proposed for EGR, as perceived by the 
present inventors, is to use EGR as a means of reducing NOx 
in medium and heavy duty turbocharged diesel engines. For 
such engines EGR should be introduced at various speed and 
load conditions to be effective in NOx reduction due to the 
type of transient testing required by EPA and CARB. In these engines the intake manifold pressure (boost) is 
typically higher than exhaust pressure in front of the 
turbine of the turbocharger. One choice would be to route 
the exhaust gas to the inlet of the compressor of the 
turbocharger. However, this is not a good practice due to 
the fouling of the compressor wheel and
