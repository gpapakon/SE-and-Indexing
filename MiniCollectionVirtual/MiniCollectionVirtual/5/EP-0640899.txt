<ABSTRACT>
In a method for programming a memory means (11) for an electronic device, a software library (8) and a means of credit (12) are used. An operator creates, with the aid of a process (7), an application-oriented program part, which determines the functionality of the electronic device. The process (7) determines the value of the program part during its creation. The program part is released for storage in the memory means (11) only after a successful settlement has been made in the means of credit (12). The method effects in a simple manner the secure settlement of the program part created on the part of the buyer of the electronic device.

A method of programming a memory means (11) for an electronic
apparatus (1), wherein a program portion (5) for bringing about the

desired functionality of the apparatus (1) is selected from a software
library (8) of a computer (6) and stored in the memory means (11) and the

price which is dependent on the program portion (5) is paid,

   characterised in that

the program portion (5) is produced or assembled from individual
elements of the software library (8) by the computer (6),
the price of the program portion (5), which is dependent on the
individual elements, is calculated,
the price is paid in a credit means (12), and
the program portion (5) is released for storage in the memory means
(11) by virtue of payment of the price.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that in addition
to the program portion (5) at least one data set which is dependent on

the functionality of the apparatus (1) is stored in the memory means
(11).
A method according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised in
that assembly of the program portion (5) and therewith the functionality

of the apparatus (1) is organised to be limitable by a right of use (R)
which is associated with an available sub-function of the apparatus (1).
A method according to claim 3 characterised in that a means in
which the applicable right of use (R) is also stored is used as the

credit means (12).
A method according to one of the preceding claims characterised
in that the memory means (11) is fitted into a memory array (3) of the

apparatus (1). 
A device for programming a memory means (11) for an electronic
apparatus (1), comprising


a computer (6) on which a process (7) can be started, which has a
software library (8),
a first device (9) for programming a memory means (11), and
a second device (10) for reading and altering a credit means (12),

   characterised in that

the process (7) assembles elements of the software library (8) to
form a program portion (5) which brings about functionality of the

apparatus (1),
the process (7) calculates a price which is dependent on the
individual elements of the program portion (5),
the second device (10) alters the credit means (12) in accordance
with the calculated price, and
the first device (9) programs the memory means (11) with the
program portion (5).
A device according to claim 6 characterised in that the credit
means (12) is a prepaid value card.
A device according to one of claims 6 and 7 characterised in
that stored on the credit means (12) is a right of use (R) which is

associated with a function of the apparatus (1).
A device according to one of claims 6 to 8 characterised in that
the memory means (11) is a part of a memory array (3) of the apparatus

(1).
A device according to one of claims 6 to 9 characterised in that
the memory means (11) is a read only memory (EPROM).
