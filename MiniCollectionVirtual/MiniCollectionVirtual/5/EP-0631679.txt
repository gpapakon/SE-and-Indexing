<ABSTRACT>
A scanner for reading two-dimensional optical information sets is described which includes a housing for supporting a photosensitive array associated with an optical string adapted to focus optical information on the array. Also provided are array and optical string controls for controlling the array and optical string such that the output of selected images on the array are processed via pattern recognition means. Images recognized to contain decodable optical information are displayed and highlighted by a display. In this fashion a user is assisted in aiming, recognizing, confirming the decodability, and decoding images of optical information incident on the array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to optical
information readers and more particularly to readers
adapted to selectively decode two-dimensional optical
information sets.Conventional bar code symbols have small data storage
capacities. This reduces the utility of conventional bar
code scanner and reader systems. For example, the 11
digit Uniform Pricing Code found on most supermarket items
acts as an identifying number which may be utilized to
access information in a database. Codes of this type do
not carry information along their vertical axis, and are
therefore, less prone to skewing errors during decoding.Two-dimensional bar code symbols or "portable data
files" have recently been developed. With codes of this
type access to a database is not required since the code
contains the information which would normally be keyed for
in a database. Since reliance on a database is not
required, information may be accessed and exchanged more
readily and reliably. However, in order to decode two
dimensional codes a more sophisticated apparatus is
required. This is primarily true since normal vertical 
code redundancy is not present, making code registration,
orientation, and condition very important.Several two-dimensional coding standards have been
proposed, e.g., Code 49, 16K, Identicode MLC-2D, and Code
PDF417. While such codes are capable of storing
information such as price, name of product, manufacturer,
weight, expiration date, inventory data, shipping
information, and the like; apparatus which assist the user
in aiming and decoding two-dimensional codes are not
currently available. For example, two dimensional
codes might consist of a stack of conventional linear
codes. Each line may contain different information, such
as (1) pricing information, (2) product name, (3) name of
the manufacturer, (4) product weight, (5) expiration date,
(6) inventory data, (7) shipping information, and the
like. Additionally, a user may require the ability to
selectively store or send portions of the decoded bar code
symbol.Therefore, it is a principal object of the present
invention is to provide a scanner adapted to selectively
read two-dimensional optical information sets.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a scanner adapted to selectively read two-dimensional
optical information sets in ambient light.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a scanner adapted to selectively read two-dimensional
optical information sets from a wide range of distances.Another object of the present invention is
