Method for co-cultivating a cell type with liver
cells,
characterised by

a cultivation of liver cells (3) on a support (1)
above which a matrix layer (4) is arranged and

above which a second cell type to be examined (5)
is applied.
Method in accordance with claim 1,
characterised by the fact
 that
oxygen is supplied to the liver cells (3) in the

form of membrane oxygenation via the support (1).
Method in accordance with claim 1 or 2,
characterised by the fact
 that
a first matrix layer (2) is arranged between the

liver cells (3) and the support (1) to anchor the
liver cells (3).
Method in accordance with any of the claims 1 to 3,
characterised by the fact
 that
a culture or nutritive medium (6) is arranged above

the second cells (5) that are arranged above the 
liver cells (3).
Method in accordance with claim 4,
characterised by the fact
 that
a third matrix layer (7) is arranged for the second

cell type (5), above which the culture or nutritive
medium (6) is placed.
Method in accordance with any of the claims 1 to 5,
characterised by the fact
 that
the second cell type (5) is arranged on its own

second support, a gap with culture or nutritive medium
(6) being adjusted between the two cell types

(3,5).
Method in accordance with claim 1,
characterised by the fact
 that
it is conducted in an incubator with increased partial

oxygen pressure.
Use of a method in accordance with claims 1 to 7
for toxicity testing of substances to be examined.
