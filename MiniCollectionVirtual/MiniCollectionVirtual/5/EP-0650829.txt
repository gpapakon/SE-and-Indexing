<ABSTRACT>
A packaging laminate for a package possessing superior gas and light 
barrier properties is disclosed, and a method of producing the packaging 

laminate (10). The packaging laminate includes a layer (17) of a silicon oxide 
compound serving as gas barrier and a layer (13) of metal serving as light 

barrier, these layers (17 and 13) being deposited by vacuum deposition on 
each respective layer (12 and 16) of plastic serving as carrier, and being 

permanently bonded to one another through an interjacent layer (20) of 
adhesive for the formation of the packaging laminate (10). 
By regulating the thickness of the gas and light barrier layers (17 and 
13 respectively) independently of one another, an optional combination of 

gas and light barrier properties is made possible, whereby the packaging 
laminate (10) may be more or less "tailor made" for each type of product 

which is to be packed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a packaging laminate possessing 
superior gas and light barrier properties, and a method of producing the 
packaging laminate. Conventional packaging materials for packages of the single-use 
disposable type generally consist of a plurality of mutually laminated 
material layers which are together intended to impart to the package the 
desired mechanical, chemical and other properties. The primary objective of 
the composition of the packaging materials is to provide the best possible 
product protection for the product which is to be packed, at the same time as 
the packaging material must be economically viable and easy to produce. In 
addition, the packaging material must be easy to reform into packages using 
conventional technology which employs modern, rational packaging 
machines of the type which form, fill and seal the packages. Use has long been made within the packaging art of laminated 
packaging materials (packaging laminates) comprising a configurationally 
rigid but foldable paper or paperboard layer and outer layers of 
thermoplastic, preferably polyethylene. In these prior art packaging 
laminates, the paper or board layer is generally very thick and imparts to the 
package superior mechanical strength and configurational stability, while 
the outer thermoplastic layers make the package liquid-tight at the same 
time as making possible reforming of the packaging laminate into packages 
by means of so-called heat sealing through which mutually facing 
thermoplastic layers are, under the simultaneous application of heat and 
pressure, brought to surface fusion with one another, for the formation of 
mechanical strong and liquid-tight sealing joints or seams. A packaging laminate consisting exclusively of paper or paperboard 
and polyethylene possesses good mechanical properties and good tightness 
properties against moisture and liquid, but is almost entirely devoid of 
tightness properties against gases, for example oxygen gas, which, as a result 
may easily penetrate through the packaging walls and come into contact  
 
with, and act on, the packed product. In order to avoid such gas contact and 
gas action on the packed product, it is therefore necessary to supplement the 
packaging laminate with at least one additional layer of a material which 
possesses gas barrier properties, and one example of such a gas barrier 
material which is often employed is an aluminium foil (Alifoil) which is 
applied to the one side of the paper or paperboard layer,
