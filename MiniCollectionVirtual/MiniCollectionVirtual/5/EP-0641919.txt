<ABSTRACT>
In a hydraulic safety valve arrangement for a hydraulically controlled and/or regulated machine or plant, especially for the purpose of rapid shut-down of a gas or steam turbine, in which safety valve arrangement (1) a plurality of hydraulic valves (15a, b; 16a, b), electrically actuated by means of a solenoid (18a, b; 19a, b) and closed in the energised condition of the solenoid, are arranged between a pressure line (8) and a pressure relief line (17) in such a way that on the one hand a through connection between the pressure line (8) and the pressure relief line (17) can be established in the event of a scheduled cut-out of one or more valves and so that, on the other hand, in the event of some of the valves failing, the function of the remaining valves can be assumed, an improved reliability is achieved in that there are at least four hydraulic valves (15a, b; 16a, b) which in twos (15a, b and 16a, b) are respectively connected in parallel in a valve-pair, and that the valve-pairs (15a, b; 16a, b) connected in parallel are connected in series between the pressure line (8) and the pressure relief line (17).

Hydraulic safety circuit for a hydraulically 
controlled and/or regulated machine or plant, in particular 

for the purpose of rapid shut-off of a gas or steam 
turbine, in which safety circuit (1) a plurality of 

hydraulic valves (2a-c; 15a,b; 16a,b) which can be 
actuated electrically by means of a magnet coil (3a-c; 

18a,b; 19a,b) and are closed in the excited state of the 
magnet coil are arranged between a pressure line (8) and 

a pressure-relief line (17) in such a way that, on the 
one hand, a continuous connection can be produced between 

the pressure line (8) and the pressure-relief line (17) 
in the event of a scheduled drop-back of one or more 

valves and, on the other hand, in the event of a failure 
of some of the valves, the function can be taken over by 

the other valves, there being at least four hydraulic 
valves (15a,b; 16a,b) of which in each case two (15a,b or 

16a,b) are connected in parallel in a valve pair, and the 
parallel-connected valve pairs (15a,b; 16a,b) being connected 

in series between the pressure line (8) and the 
pressure-relief line (17), characterized in that a 

monitoring circuit (24) is provided for at least one of 
the parallel-connected valve pairs (15a,b or 16a,b), 

which monitoring circuit monitors the function of both 
hydraulic valves of the valve pair and, in the event of 

a failure of at least one of the hydraulic valves, gives 
off a failure signal, and in that an actuation circuit 

(25) is provided for the other valve pair (16a,b or 
15a,b), which actuation circuit is connected to the 

monitoring circuit (24) and actuates the two hydraulic 
valves of the valve pair if it receives a failure signal 

from the monitoring circuit (24). 
Safety circuit according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the hydraulic valves (15a,b; 16a,b) are each 

equipped with only one passage channel (22a,b; 23a,b). 
safety circuit according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that the hydraulic valves (15a,b; 16a,b) are 

designed as control valves with a valve seat. 
Method of operating a safety circuit according to  
 

Claim 1, the hydraulic valves of a first valve pair 
(15a,b or 16a,b) being kept closed in the normal operating 

state by exciting the corresponding magnet coils 
(18a,b or 19a,b), and at least one of the two hydraulic 

valves of the first valve pair (15a,b or 16a,b) being 
opened in the event of a shut-off to produce a continuous 

connection between the pressure line (8) and the 
pressure-relief line (17), characterized in that the 

hydraulic valves of the second valve pair (16a,b or 
15a,b) are open in the normal operating state. 
Method according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that, in the event of a failure of one of the hydraulic 

valves of the first valve pair (15a,b or 16a,b), the two 
hydraulic valves of the second valve pair (16a,b or 

15a,b) are closed, in that the other hydraulic valve of 
the first valve pair (15a,b or 16a,b) is opened, and in 

that, in the event of a shut-off, at least one of the two 
hydraulic valves of the second valve pair (16a,b or 

15a,b) is opened to produce a continuous connection 
between the pressure line (8) and the pressure-relief 

line (17). 
Method according to one of Claims 4 and 5, 
characterized in that, for testing the hydraulic valves 

of the two valve pairs (15a,b; 16a,b;) during normal 
operation, in a first step the hydraulic valves of the 

first valve pair (15a,b or 16a,b) are kept closed and the 
hydraulic valves of the second valve pair (16a,b or 

15a,b) are closed, then opened, and subsequently closed 
again, in that, in a second step, the hydraulic valves of 

the second valve pair (16a,b or 15a,b) are kept closed 
and the hydraulic valves of the first valve pair (15a,b 

or 16a,b) are opened and subsequently closed again, and 
in that, in a third step, the hydraulic valves of the 

second valve pair (16a,b or 15a,b) are opened again.
