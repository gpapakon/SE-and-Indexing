<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the biodegradation under 
highly alkaline conditions of organics in a waste stream 
which is rich in oxalates and is typically derived from a 
Bayer processing system for producing aluminum oxides 
from bauxite. A common problem in the processing of mineral ores, 
particularly in the processing of bauxite by the Bayer 
process, for the production of alumina is the generation 
and accumulation of oxalate ions commonly referred to as 
oxalates in the Bayer processing streams and waste 
streams. Environmental concerns may prevent the dumping 
of oxalates at disposal sites. In view of the 
appreciable quantities of oxalate solids which have to be 
removed from the Bayer process, which may range from one 
to ten tons daily in a typical medium-sized Bayer 
processing plant, the use of large scale disposal systems 
are required. For example, the solid oxalates with or 
without liming may be buried in red mud from the Bayer 
processing system. The oxalates could also be burned in 
a kiln, such as a lime kiln; however, these procedures 
are by and large prohibitively expensive. As is generally understood, bauxites by and large 
contain low percentages, usually less than 0.5% of 
organic matter mostly in the form of humates. In the 
Bayer processing system, the humates, which dissolve in 
the process liquors, are ultimately degraded to acetates, 
formates, carbonates and oxalates. These compounds tend 
to concentrate as their sodium salts in the processing 
liquors. Most of these sodium salts have relatively high 
solubilities in the processing liquors and as such do not 
interfere with the process. However, sodium oxalates 
have a relatively low solubility and readily precipitate 
out of the processing liquors particularly in portions of 
the processing system which operate at cooler  
 
temperatures and higher caustic soda concentrations. As 
the oxalates precipitate out of the processing solution, 
restrictions in the processing system result which can 
considerably reduce the effectiveness of the overall 
processing operation. Furthermore, the build-up of 
oxalates in the processing liquors tends to cause a 
reduction in alumina trihydrate yield from the process 
and ultimately a co-precipitation of the sodium oxalate 
with the alumina trihydrate. When the alumina trihydrate 
is contaminated with oxalates, it has been found that 
calcination of the precipitate results in a very weak and 
fine alumina which leads to excessive dust losses in the 
subsequent calcination step and

In a process for biodegrading under highly alkaline 
conditions organics in a waste stream derived from a 

Bayer processing system for producing aluminum oxides, 

i) said waste stream being typical of oxalate 
waste streams resulting from alkaline treatment of 

bauxite, said oxalate waste streams being rich in 
oxalates, formates, acetates, benzoates and sodium ions 

and having a pH in excess of 8, 
ii) treating said highly alkaline waste stream to 
neutralize and thereby lower pH and to reduce sodium ion 

concentration prior to introducing said waste stream into 
a bioreactor, 
iii) biodegrading said oxalates in said bioreactor 
by use of 
Pseudomonas
 genus microorganisms, and 
iv) discharging at least a portion of the 
biodegraded waste stream, the improvement being 

characterized by: 

a) introducing said highly alkaline waste 
stream rich in sodium ions to said bioreactor to avoid 

said treatment of step ii), 
b) biodegrading said organics in said waste 
stream with said 
Pseudomonas
 genus microorganisms having 
the characteristics of ATCC 53883 and its derivatives 

which are functionally biologically equivalent to ATCC 
53883, and 
c) wherein said biodegradation of organics, 
degrades in addition to oxalates in said waste stream, 

said formates, said acetates and said benzoates to yield 
said biodegraded waste stream.

In a process of claim 8, said rotating biological 
contactor operating at a pH of approximately 9 in each 

compartment. 
In a process of claim 3, said carbonates and 
bicarbonates buffer pH of media in said bioreactor to 

protect said microorganisms from momentary swings in pH 
of said waste stream due to temporary high acid content. 
In a process of claim 1, said improvement being

phosphorus and nitrogen to said biocontactor as nutrients 
for said microorganisms.
