<DESCRIPTION>
*-BROFAROMINE AS AN AGENT FOR TREAΗNG POST-TRAUMATIC STRESSFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to psychological disorders associated with traumatic stress and its management. The invention further deals with brofaromine, a selective, reversible onoamine oxidase type A inhibitor, with serotonin uptake inhibitory properties..BACKGROUNDBrofaromine is an Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) inhibitor antidepressant compound, first patented in the US in 1980 by Schenker et al. (US 4,210,655), which patent is incorporated herein by reference. This patent states that brofaromine, i.e. 4-(5-methoxy-2- benzofuranyl)-piperidine, is a selective MAO type A inhibitor, blocks serotonin reuptake, and that the compound is useful in the treatment of depression.J. Neural Transm (1989) [Suppl] 28: 21-31 discusses the differences in effect on tyramine-elicited blood pressure elevation in subjects which were not medicated, medicated with irreversible MAO inhibitors, or reversible MAO inhibitors. Brofaromine and moclobemide are mentioned specifically as the reversible MAO inhibitors. There is no mention or suggestion of efficacy in psychological disorders of any kind.J. Neural Transm (1989) [Suppl] 28: 33-44 reports on the therapeutic and side effect profile of brofaromine in the context of depressive disease states.In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that there are a number of distinct psychological disorders that are not well understood and have been inappropriately 

lumped together in the past Many of these disorders can occur with or without depression as a component thereof. Separate and apart from depression, the following have now been recognized by DSM-ID.-R, the diagnostic and statistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association, as distinct disorders: panic disorder with agoraphobia, social phobia, bulimia, borderline personality disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among others.PTSD is a condition believed to be brought on by the witnessing of traumatic events which so shock ones sensibilities that an indelible mark is left on the individual. Motor vehicle accidents, war injuries, crime (especially violent crime), child and spousal abuse, natural disasters, industrial accidents, etc. are typical types of incidents which carry some of the hallmarks of PTSD in susceptible patients whether or not there is any significant physical injury to the victim of or participant in the event More importantly, there is an even larger population of patients exhibiting the symptoms of the
