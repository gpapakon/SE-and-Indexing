<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus-supporting system which can easily be moved, particularly in terms of translation. This system is of the type comprising at least one arm (1 or 3) articulated by one end to a support structure (2) and at its other end bearing a load (6) which is at least representative of the said apparatus and means for stabilising the latter in each position after movement from a previous position. The system is characterised in that the arm (1 or 3) is produced in the form of a parallelogram formed of two bars (8, 9; 10, 11) and a spring-loaded device (14, 26) is articulated at one end to one of the bars and at its other end to a link rod device (15; 25) interposed between the two bars so that the spring force varies nonlinearly, compensating for the nonlinearity of the moment produced by the load. The invention can be used in the medical field, for example of a dental radiography cell.
