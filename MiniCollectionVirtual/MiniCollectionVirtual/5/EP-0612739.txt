<ABSTRACT>
Production of ketene dimers from fatty acid halides by 
reaction with tertiary amines whereby the tertiary amine is 

used both as a reactant and as a solvent/diluent. In the 
process at least 1.15 moles of tertiary amine is used per mole 

of fatty acid halide and the process is carried out in the 

substantial absence of an additional solvent, whereby the 
produced ketene dimer is obtained by stripping of the tertiary 

amine followed by separation of formed crystals of tertiary 
amine hydrogen halide by acid extraction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of ketene dimers from fatty acid halides and tertiary
amines and more particularly to a process for the production of ketene dimers in which the tertiary amine is used both
as a reactant and as solvent/diluent and the process is carried out in the presence of not more than 10% by weight,
based on the amount of fatty acid halide, of an additional solvent, whereby the produced ketene dimer is obtained by
stripping of tertiary amine followed by separation of formed crystals of tertiary amine hydrogen halide by acid extraction.Long-chain "alkyl" ketene dimers (AKD) are extensively used in the papermaking industry as sizing agents and
usually in the form of aqueous dispersions comprising cationic starch or cationic synthetic polymers as dispersing agents.
Long-chain alkyl ketene dimers are produced by removal of hydrogen halide from fatty acid halides. The intermediate
ketene is highly reactive and dimerizes. Conventionally the production of long-chain alkyl ketene dimers is carried out
.by addition of a tertiary amine to a fatty acid chloride substrate in an organic solvent, or by addition of fatty acid chloride
to a tertiary amine in an organic solvent. The tertiary amine is usually used in a small molar excess, e.g. 1.1 moles of
tertiary amine per mole of fatty acid chloride. The tertiary amine removes hydrogen chloride from the fatty acid chloride
and crystals of amine hydrochlorides are formed. These crystals and the small excess of amine are then removed from
the reaction mixture. This is usually made by acid extraction, thereby the remaining tertiary amine is converted to an
amine salt soluble in the acid extraction medium. The produced AKD is obtained by evaporation of the solvent from the
organic extraction phase. In commercial processes the acid extraction medium is usually worked-up by neutralisation
with alkali to liberate free amine from the amine salt and finally the tertiary amine is dehydrated for re-use in the process.The organic solvents which are used are inert with regard to the starting materials and the end-product. As inert
solvents alkanes, cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons can be used. Usually aromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene
and 1,2-dichloropropane, are used in commercial processes. The amount of solvent is usually fairly high and most often
at least 0.8 parts solvent as to 1 part fatty acid chloride is used. The solvent acts both as a solvent for the fatty acid
halide and the AKD and as a diluent to keep the
