<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for carrying out operations
involving cryogenic temperatures as well as temperatures above 0°C.
More particularly, the invention is directed to apparatus which permits to
carry out such operations in a highly controlled manner.The ability to cause fast changes in temperatures, particularly between
very low temperatures and room or higher temperatures, on a desired
surface and at a desired location, is of practical importance in many uses.
Fast temperature changes can be exploited, for instance, in the treatment
of various materials, for sealing or surface curing purposes, etc.Cold and hot surfaces are used also for medical uses. For instance,
cryogenic techniques are employed to destroy malignant tissues, or for
plastic surgery. One example of such a use is presented in SU 774,549,
which relates to a thermal treatment of biological tissues by passing heat
carriers through a cryosurgical probe. The method is said to be useful in
the cryo-surgery of the human brain. This method, however, involves
passing a heat carrier through a surgical probe, its subsequent heating
and repeated passage through the probe. Acetone or alcohol are used as
the heat carrier. Prior to its passage through the probe the heat carrier is
either cooled to -70-75°C, or heated to +70-90°C. Devices of this type present severe drawbacks, inasmuch as they have
long lags in temperature changes, they require cumbersome
heating/cooling apparatus outside the probe, and are complicated and
expensive to use.Cryosurgical instruments having both cryocooling and heating
capabilities are also known in the art. One such device and its medical
use have been described by Andrew A. Gage ["Current Issues in
Cryosurgery", Cryobiology19, 219-222(1982), at pp. 220-21]. The device
described therein was cooled by liquid nitrogen and electrically heated, to
provide hemostasis. The electrical heating, however, by its nature is a
relatively slow procedure.Another device is described in SU 1,217,377, which exploits the expansion
of gases through an orifice. However, simple expansion of gas through an
orifice provides relatively slow temperature changes, and the changes in
temperature are relatively mild. Thus, for instance, in the device of SU
1,217,377 it is not possible to liquefy nitrogen. Additionally, this prior art
device employs helium at room temperature which, expanding from a
pressure of about 300 atmospheres, will attain a heating of merely about
30°C. In any case, in the single pass expansion described in
