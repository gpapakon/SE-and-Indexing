 TITLEHOT-MELT ADHESIVES FOR PVC WITH GOOD HIGHTEMPERATURE UTILITYBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention relates to ethylene copolymer based hot-melt adhesives which retain good adhesion at elevated temperatures, and more specifically it relates to such adhesives formulated from a blend of certain specified ethylene copolymers with thermoplastic block-polyester elastomers, together with a tackifier. The adhesives are particularly useful for use with unprimed polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based substrates. Description of Related ArtUse of adhesives applied as a hot melt is growing rapidly because hot melts allow fast production speeds. However, for many applications, limited temperature resistance of hot-melt adhesives is a major deficiency. This is the result of seemingly contrasting requirements. Hot-melt application requires high fluidity at application temperatures, yet adhesive strength at high temperatures requires a strength which any fluidity would preclude. While hot-melt adhesives with a broad range of viscosities are known, viscosities required for hot-melt application are considerably less than those employed in common plastic forming operations such as molding and extrusion. As a result, formulation with low viscosity additives is commonly employed. While such additives have other functions as well, they 'dilute' the polymer properties. Use of lower molecular weight polymers also reduces viscosity but results in adhesives with less 'guts'. The combination of fluidity, strength and high-temperature utility is thus a major challenge for hot-melt adhesives.Adhesives are, to a significant extent, substrate specific. Whe an adhesive composition does not adhere well to a specific substrate, adhesion can be improved to some extent by 'priming' the substrate. This is often the case with rigid PVC. However, it is more desirable and less expensive not to have to prime a substrate. When the substrate is not primed, adhesiveness to a substrate requires a certain chemical 

'compatibility' with that substrate. For PVC, known hot-melt adhesives include ethylene copolymers at the low-cost, low-performance end and certain polyamides and certain types of polyesters at the high-cost, high-performance end. Polyamide hot-melts, useful for PVC, have good temperature resistance. However they are expensive and are moisture sensitive.Ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymers were among the earliest hot melt adhesives. They may be used as PVC adhesives, and with moderate to high levels of vinyl acetate
