<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
molding a medical prosthetic article and, more particularly,
to both a molding method of manufacturing a
medical prosthetic article by charging a cavity of a
sealed plaster mold under a predetermined vacuum with
a resin, and a sealed mold structure for practicing
the molding method.It has been known in the prior art that medical
prosthetic articles such as bedded artificial teeth or
artificial bones or limbs to be fitted in human bodies
are molded of resins. For this molding process with
resins, there have been practiced a compression molding
method and an injection molding method, which use
a plaster mold fitted in a working mold of a metal or 
the like. Of these, the compression molding method is
carried out by overlaying sheets of a thermoplastic
resin in a plaster bottom mold while heating the same
with an infrared ray and by compressing the overlaid
resin sheets, when softened, with the bottom mold and
a top mold. As disclosed by us in Japanese Patent
Publication No. 2032/1982, on the other hand, the aforementioned
injection molding method is carried out
by injecting a molten resin into the cavity of a plaster
mold formed in the working mold.However, each of these methods has been accompanied
by a problem that the molten resin may be encountered
by a non-homogenous flow or by incorporation
of gases produced during the molding process, because
the medical prosthetic article often has a complicated
shape and/or portions of different thicknesses. Another
problem is that the resultant molding may be encountered
by a strain such as a warp or twist due to
the shrinkage of the resin cooled. Specifically, in
case the medical prosthetic article is exemplified by
bedded artificial teeth, its portion corresponding to
the palatal surface of an upper jaw has to be made as
thin as about 0.5 to 1.2 mm whereas its tooth socket
head is made as thick as about 10 mm. Thus, the bedded
artificial teeth are highly different in their local 
thicknesses so that the denture base is subjected
to a molding strain to float or warp from the inner
face of the mold. This molding strain has to be manually
corrected by the operator.Another method and device for manufacturing dental prosthetic
articles is disclosed in WO-A-8602259 where a vacuum is applied
to the cavity of a mold via a porous material like a plaster.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention
to provide a method and a mold of manufacturing a medical
prosthetic article while suppressing a molding strain.Another
