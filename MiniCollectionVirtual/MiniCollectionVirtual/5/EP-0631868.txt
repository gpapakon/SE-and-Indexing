<ABSTRACT>
A device for attaching printing plates (6) in register on the plate cylinder (1) of printing machines, in particular sheet-fed offset printing machines, is described, in which the attachment devices (3), designed in the form of clamping bars, for clamping the printing plates by means of their trailing end interact with spring elements (10) in such a way that the clamping force for the printing plate is brought about by the spring forces. In order that the printing plate can be stretched in accordance with any corrections necessary in the circumferential direction additionally beyond the forces originating from the spring elements, a manually actuable clamping device (17) is provided, which is inserted by one end in bores (15) mounted fixedly in the cylinder, and the corresponding clamping-bar section is moved by rotation over the desired correction path by means of a cam piece (20) mounted on the tool.

Process for register exact tensioning of printing 
plates (6) on the plate cylinder (1) of printing 

presses, particularly offset sheet printing presses, 
in which, for tensioning, an edge of the printing 

plate (6) coordinated to the print end (DE) by means 
of a fixing device (3) arranged in an axially 

parallel channel (2) of the plate cylinder (1) is 
moved by the force of spring elements (10) arranged 

with respect to the fixing device (3) as well as by 
the force of an additional tensioning device (17) 

substantially in the peripheral direction of a plate 
cylinder (1), characterised in that for register 

exact adjustment after tensioning the printing plate 
(6), the additional tensioning device (17), which 

cooperates exclusively on its actuation in 
positively interlocked fashion with the fixing 

device (3), is actuated and thereby the tensioning 
device (17) moves the fixing device (3) in the 

direction of the tensioning force generated by the 
spring elements (10). 
Device for register exact tensioning of printing 
plates (6) on the plate cylinder (1) of printing 

presses, particularly offset sheet printing presses, 
wherein the plate cylinder (1) has in an axially 

parallel channel a fixing device (3) for an edge of 
the printing plate (6) coordinated to the print end 

(DE), spring elements (10) are arranged relative to 
the fixing device (3) by the force of which the 

tensioning of the print end (DE) of the printing 
plate (6) takes place substantially in the 

peripheral direction of the plate cylinder (1) and 
an additional tensioning device (17) is arranged 

relative to the fixing device (3) by means of which 
the fixing device (3) is movable substantially in  

 
the peripheral direction of the plate cylinder (1) 

for carrying out the process according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the additional tensioning 

device (17) is constructed as a manually actuatable 
tensioning tool, that the manually actuatable 

tensioning tool consists of a shaft (18) which has 
on one end a handle (19) and at the other end on the 

prolongation of the shaft (18) a pin (16), which can 
be inserted into a bore (15) arranged fixed with 

respect to the cylinder and relative to the fixing 
device (3) and that in the region between pin (16) 

and shaft (18) a cam piece (20) is arranged which 
acts on the part of the fixing device (3) turned 

towards the channel (2), wherein the fixing device 
(3) is mounted swivellably about a swivel axis (5) 

running parallel to the axis of the plate cylinder 
(1). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that 
the exterior contour of the cam piece (20) is 

constructed arched. 
Device according to the Claims 2 or 3, characterised 
in that with several fixing devices (3) provided 

across the format width of the printing plate (6), a 
bore (15) for introduction of the pin (16) of the 

tensioning tool is provided for each fixing device 
(3). 
Device according to the Claims 2, 3 or 4, 
characterised in that with several fixing devices 

(3) provided across the format width of the printing 
plate (6), these are mounted displaceably by a given 

amount in the axial direction, and that bores (15) 
fixed with respect to the cylinder are arranged in 

the region between the fixing devices (3) for 
introduction of the pin (16) of the tensioning tool.
