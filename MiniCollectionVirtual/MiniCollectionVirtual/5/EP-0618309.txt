<ABSTRACT>
A metal powder composition for metallization, which is used 
for forming a metallized coating from a paste comprising copper and 

titanium powder and is composed of 95-99.5% of copper and 0.5-5 % 
of titanium by weight. A metallized substrate is obtained by coating a 

substrate with the paste and baking the resultant substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a metal powder
composition for metallization which is for use in forming
a conductor layer of a thick-film electronic circuit and
in forming a copper circuit to diffuse heat generated by
operation of elements and parts mounted on a ceramics
substrate for an electronic apparatus, and also relates
to a metallized substrate.Generally, a substrate for an electronic circuit
is required to have several characteristics, namely, to
assure an excellent insulation property and a high
mechanical strength, to prevent deterioration of
electronic elements mounted thereon, to readily form a
bond with a metal conductor, and to exhibit a high heat
conductivity. Such a substrate can be made of alumina
ceramics, nitride ceramics, and the like. On a single
ceramics body, however, it is impossible to directly
mount transistors, diodes, IC's, LSI's, and various other
electronic parts used in an electronic apparatus. In view of the above, a conventional electronic
circuit is assembled by the use of a metallized film
formed on a surface of the ceramics substrate. The
metallized film is used as a conductor layer itself or
serves to bond the ceramics substrate to a metal
conductor. Preferably, the conductor layer or the metal
conductor is made of an inexpensive material having a
small electric resistance. Generally, copper is used.
Heretofore, the metallized film is formed on the ceramics
substrate by the steps of screen-printing a copper
conductor paste onto the ceramics substrate to a
thickness between 10 and 30 µm, drying the paste, and
then firing the paste in a nitrogen atmosphere to form
the circuit.The metallized film formed on the ceramics
substrate according to the above-mentioned method may be
made of a copper conductor paste containing glass frit
for nitride or oxide. However, a vertical tensile test
for a square pad of 2mm long revealed that the bonding
strength between the ceramics substrate and the
metallized film was no more than about 2kg. In a
high-temperature aging test at 150oC, the bonding
strength was reduced to less than a half of its initial
value after the lapse of 100 hours or so. Particularly,
the copper paste for nitride ceramics having an increased
bonding strength and an improved reliability is
unavailable at present. On the other hand, Japanese Patent Publication
JP-A-H04-280880 discloses a metal powder paste having a
composition essentially consisting of 70 to 95 wt% Cu and
5 to 30 wt% Ti. This metal powder paste is free from
deterioration at a high temperature and has an
