<ABSTRACT>
An EVA insole manufacturing process, comprising 
a step to mix EVA resin with foaming agent for producing 

molding (10) through injection molding process, a step to heat the 
molding thus obtained to foam into shape (20) in a mold. Two or 

more moldings (30, 40) which contain different concentration of 
foaming agent or different pigment color may be put together 

in a common mold for integral foaming and form setting 
process, so as to produce an insole which has different 

hardness and color at different part.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an EVA insole manufacturing 
process. In a conventional EVA insole manufacturing process, an EVA 
resin is mixed with a foaming agent, and the mixture is 
then squeezed into strips. The EVA material strips are then 
placed in a hot press and subjected to a foaming process. 
After foaming, the foamed EVA strips are placed in a water 
cooling trough for cooling. After cooling, the foamed EVA 
strips are cut and trimmed, or sometimes, some pieces of 
trimmed EVA pieces are adhered together. After passing 
through a grinding process, the EVA strips thus obtained 
are placed in a hydraulic machine for form setting. Thus, a 
whole EVA insole manufacturing process is completed. This 
EVA insole manufacturing process is not satisfactory, 
because of the following disadvantages: 
1. It requires much human power. In a complete production 
line, there are generally more than 30 experienced workers 
required. 2. Much waste material is produced. Because EVA strips are 
cut and sheared after the foaming process, approximately 40 
% or more of the foamed EVA strips are cut off and become 
useless. Disposal of the waste material is still a problem 
to settle, and it may cause environmental pollution. 3. It consumes much time (about 3 or more days) to produce 
a specific style of an EVA insole. Therefore, it is not 
suitable for producing various styles or designs of EVA 
insoles at a time.  
 4. If an insole is comprised of several EVA strips of 
different hardness bound together, an insole may tear 
easily due to weak structural strength. Further, a method of injection molding a foamed thermoplastic 
resin ball core, particularly used for baseballs, 
softballs etc., is known from US-A-4144297. This known 
method proposes to form a flowable homogeneous mass of 
thermoplastic resin and a blowing agent in an injection 
molding machine and to inject the mass into a mold to foam 
the mass. By holding the mass in the mold for a sufficient 
time to form a non-porous skin, and by a specific cooling 
procedure a game ball shall be produced which has the 
substantially same dimension as the mold cavity. From US-A-3562042, a method of joining moldings of expanded 
olefin polymers is known in which it is not necessary to 
use an adhesive. This is achieved by pressing one molding 
against the other, the moldings still containing expanding 
agent and whose surfaces having temperatures which are from 
5° to 30°C below the melting point of the olefin polymer. Starting from this prior art, the

An EVA insole manufacturing process comprising: 

a) forming a first molding (30) and a second molding (40) 
respectively by the steps of 


aa) mixing an ethylene vinyl acetate resin with a foaming 
agent according to a predetermined proportion, and 

squeezing the resulting mixture into a flat block; 
ab) crushing the flat block into pieces and respectively 
injection molding the pieces into the first molding (30) 

and the second molding (40) so that the first molding (30) 
has an trough (31) for receiving the second molding (40); 
b) placing the second molding (40) within the trough (31) 
of the first molding (30) and heat foaming both the first 

and second moldings together in a mold to form an integral 
molding; and 
c) form setting the integral molding into an insole.
