<ABSTRACT>
A ceramic composition especially useful for a thermistor exhibiting stable 
resistance values over a wide temperature range and capable 

of being used for a prolonged time is described. The composition is 
represented by the formula (M¹M²O₂)
1-x
 · (M¹AlO₃)
x
, wherein M¹ is an 
element selected from the elements of the group 3A excluding 

La and M² is an element of the groups 4A, 5A, 6A, 7A and 8, 
and wherein the mixing ratio between an electrically 

conductive substance stable at elevated temperatures and an 
insulating substance stable at elevated temperatures, may be 

adjusted. A thermistor formed of the composition is 
superior in high-temperature stability and can be used over 

a broad temperature range because its resistance value can 
be selected to an optimum value. 
Furthermore described is a process for producing a ceramic composition and 
a process for producing a thermistor element (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ceramic (or porcelain) 
composition for a thermistor, a thermistor element comprising 
the ceramic composition as well as processes for producing the 
ceramic composition and the thermistor element. As a thermistor material which may be employed at higher 
temperatures, (a) a material mainly composed of a corundum type 
crystal structure, as disclosed for example in JP Patent KOKAI 
Publication No. 50-118294 (JP-A-118294/75) or in "Fine Ceramic 
Handbook" by K. Yano, published by ASAKURA SHOTEN in 1984; (b) 
a material mainly composed of a compound having a spinel type 
crystal structure, as disclosed for example in JP Patent KOKAI 
Publication No. 49-63995 (JP-A-63995/74), (c) a material mainly 
composed of zirconia, as disclosed in e.g. "Nainenkikan" 
(Internal Combustion Engine) vol 30, No. 8, page 98, and (d) a 
material mainly composed of a compound having a perovskite type 
crystal structure, may be used. US-A-4 229 322 discloses a 
ceramic component suitable for preparing electrodes having the 
compositional formula: 
Yx(Mgy Crz)w Al(1-w) O3.Furthermore, JP-A-51 108 298 describes a resistance 
ceramic composition used in thermistors comprising LaCrO3 and 
LaAlO3. However, according to the eager investigation of the 
inventors of the present invention the following problems have 
been turned out. With the material (a) mainly composed of the 
corundum crystal structure, the resistance - temperature 
characteristics cannot be adjusted to a larger extent. If, for 
example, the additive is added in an excess quantity, the 
structure ceases to remain the stable corundum type crystal 
structure, resulting in deteriorated thermal stability. The material (b) mainly composed of the spinel type 
crystal structure has a higher rate of change of the 
resistance versus temperature (a higher temperature gradient  
 
constant β), so that it cannot be employed over a wider 
temperature range. On the other hand, materials mainly 
composed of NiAl2O4 or CoAl2O4 are low in the thermal 
resistance and hence cannot be employed at elevated 
temperatures. The material (c) mainly composed of zirconia is oxygen 
ion conductive and is increased in resistance in a 
temperature range lower than the activation temperature so 
that it cannot be employed practically. The material (d) mainly composed of the compound having the 
perovskite type crystal structure has such inconvenience 
that, if only a slight amount of La oxides remain unreacted, 
the non-reacted La component reacts with the atmospheric
