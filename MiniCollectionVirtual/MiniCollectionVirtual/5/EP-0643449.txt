<ABSTRACT>
A cable connector for a ribbon cable (37), comprising a housing 
of electrically insulating material with a plurality of contact 

elements, each contact element having a connecting portion formed 
as a plug-on contact for connection to a conductor of the ribbon 

cable (37), said housing having an opening extending from a first 
side to a second opposing side for receiving said ribbon cable 

(37), said contact elements being arranged in rows and columns, 
said opening comprising a series of open channels (38) each comprising 

only one plug-on contact, the contact elements disposed 
adjacent to the second side of the housing being arranged in a 

manner such that, if two of said cable connectors are positioned 
opposite each other, the respective contact elements in both cable 

connectors within one and the same column are separated from each 

other by a distance of at least one column.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cable connector as defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such a cable connector is known from EP-A-0,095,271.Another, similar cable connector is known from Unites States patent
4.410.222 which discloses a connector assembly comprising a female
connector connected to the ribbon cable and a male connector connected
to a circuit member. The female connector comprises a first
housing comprising plug-on contact members for connection to conductors
of the ribbon cable and a second housing, the ribbon cable
in use being clamped between the first and second housing.A connector module generally comprises a housing of electrically
insulative material which accommodates a plurality of contact
elements or terminals arranged in rows and columns. The contact
elements have a base section and a contact end and connecting end
extending from opposite ends of the base section. The connecting
ends project outside one side of the housing and are connected to a
printed circuit board.There have long been attempts to accommodate electronic circuits
in as modular a design as possible on printed circuit boards
of standard dimensions. The interconnections between the individual
modules and components, such as recorders, playback devices, etc.,
are preferably made via electronic connectors. As a consequence of
miniaturization and due to the high density of present day integrated
circuits, a large number of electronic components can be
mounted on a printed circuit board so that a large number of functions
can be carried out by a module of this type. The number of
terminals needed for connection to other modules has, likewise,
increased.As a result, there is a great need for connectors with a high
contact element density, i.e., with a large number of electrical
contacts or terminals per unit of volume. The need for connectors
with high contact element density has become even greater as a 
result of the advent of surface mounting technology whereby electronic
components are surface mounted to the printed circuit board.
Surface mounted devices (SMD) are not mounted on a printed circuit
board via the usual pinhole connection but are connected directly
to the surface of the printed circuit itself. By surface mounting
techniques, it is possible to mount electronic components readily
on either surface of a board without interfering with connecting
pins which project through the board. This results in a component
density which is even higher than that achieved with conventional
pinhole connections and a

A cable connector for a ribbon cable (37), comprising a
housing of electrically insulating material with a plurality of

contact elements, each contact element accommodated within a
predetermined cavity and having a connecting portion formed as a plug-on

contact for connection to a conductor of the ribbon cable (37), the
connecting portions being equidistantly arranged in a plurality of

columns, wherein the position of each connecting portion in a
predetermined column is shifted relative to the position of adjacent

connecting portions in an adjacent column by one half the distance
between two adjacent connecting portions within one single column,

said housing having an opening extending from a first side to a second
opposing side for receiving said ribbon cable (3j), said opening

comprising a series of open channels (38) entirely enclosed by said
housing and extending perpendicular to the direction of the columns,

only one connection portion being located in each channel (38)
characterized in that the contact terminals are arranged within the

corresponding cavities such that any line in the plane of said series of open channels and perpendicular to the
direction of the columns is intersected by one contact terminal only.
A cable connector according to claim 1 characterized in that
said cable connector comprises two columns and an even number of

contact elements within each column.
A cable connector according to any of the preceding claims
characterized in that the cavities in the cable connector are arranged

in rows and columns, the mutual distance between adjacent cavities
within any column being equal to the mutual distance between adjacent

conductors of said ribbon cable, the cavities within any column
alternately accommodating one of said contact terminals and being

unused.
A cable connector according to any of the preceding claims
characterized in that the pitch distance between adjacent contact

elements is 2 mm.
A cable connector according to any of the preceding claims
characterized in that the contact elements have a flat base section.
A cable connector according to any of the preceding claims
characterized in that the housing of said cable connector has external

dimensions such that two or more of said cable connectors can be 
positioned adjacent to each other without loss of space for one or

more contact elements.
