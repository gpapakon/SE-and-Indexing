<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shaving equipment. It is, of course, commonplace to use a glass mirror permanently 
mounted on a wall or bathroom cabinet as a shaving mirror. Also, 
portable glass shaving mirrors are known which can be stood on a shelf 
or ledge. However, these known portable shaving mirrors are of little 
use if a suitable shelf or ledge is not available, for example in a 
shower, and furthermore, in this case, there may be nowhere close to 
hand to put the razor after a shave. Also, these known mirrors are 
prone to misting up in a bathroom atmosphere. This invention is more particularly concerned with shaving 
equipment of the type comprising a mirror; a sucker for releasably 
attaching the mirror to a wall or the like; and means for releasably 
attaching a razor to the equipment. An example of such equipment is known from patent specification 
US-A-4,655,559. In that known equipment, the mirror is provided on the 
front of a reservoir, from the bottom of which a pin projects. The pin 
fits into a socket in a bracket which is connected by a ball and socket 
joint to a sucker for attachment to a wall. The bracket also has a 
rack for holding a grooming article, such as a razor. By disconnecting 
the pin and socket joint, the mirrored reservoir can be removed for 
emptying and recharging with hot water to reduce the tendency of the 
mirror to fog-up. The equipment of US-A-4,655,559 is complicated and 
is not particularly aesthetically pleasing. Also, the pin and socket 
connection provides a weak link susceptible to breakage. According to the invention there is provided shaving equipment, 
comprising: 
   a mirror; 
   a sucker for releasably attaching the mirror to a wall or the 
like; and 
   means for releasably attaching a razor to the equipment; 
   characterised by: 
   the sucker and the razor attaching means being disposed, 
respectively, behind and in front of the mirror; and 
   means operable to facilitate release of the sucker from the wall 
or the like. In one embodiment, the sucker has a stem portion which passes  
 
through the aperture in the mirror, and a loop or hook portion in front 
of the mirror forming the razor attaching means. The sucker can 
therefore be hidden from normal view, leaving just the mirror and the 
loop or hook portion visible. In another embodiment, the sucker has a stem portion which passes 
through the aperture in the mirror, and means for attaching the stem 
portion to a razor cassette in front of the mirror to which a razor can 
be attached. Again,
