<ABSTRACT>
A step exercise apparatus comprises a first foot operated 
pulley (108), a second foot operated pulley (110) and a user 

selectable lever (222) adapted to operate a resiliently biased 
connector (182) having pins (184,186) for disengagably 

entering in apertures (148,150,152;158,160,162) in the pulleys 
(108,110) so that the pulleys (108,110) are locked together 

for cooperative rotative movement in an interdependent 
operative mode at one position of the lever (222) and the 

pulleys (108,110) are disengaged one from another for 
independent rotative movement upon withdrawal of the pins 

(184,186) from the apertures (148,150,152; 158,160,162) in an 
independent operative mode at a second position of the lever 

(222).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to step exercise 
equipment which simulates stair climbing and in 
particular to step exercise equipment in which a 
mechanical transmission is used to connect 
reciprocating step action to a source of rotational 
mechanical resistance. Exercise equipment which simulates stair 
climbing is an increasingly popular form of exercise. 
A variety of equipment types have been proposed to meet 
the demand for step exercise equipment. The most 
common types of step exercise equipment can generally 
be divided between those which use a hydraulic 
mechanism and those which use a mechanical transmission 
to connect the steps to a source of resistance. 
Examples of hydraulic step exercise equipment include 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,681,316 and 4,685,666. Examples of 
mechanical step exercise equipment include U.S. Patent 
Nos. 4,708,338, 4,949,993, 5,013,031, 5,180,351 and 
5,135,447. Mechanical step exercise equipment may be 
further divided between those with dependent step modes 
and those with independent step modes. A dependent 
step mode is characterized by a mechanism in which 
movement of one step or pedal causes the second step or 
pedal to move. In contrast, an independent step mode 
is characterized by a mechanism which permits each step 
or pedal to move independently of the other step or 
pedal. U.S. Patent No. 5,013,031 discloses a step 
exercise apparatus having a dependent stepping 
mechanism. The two foot levers are connected by a rope 
which extends over a central idler pulley. Pushing  
 
down on one foot lever pulls on the rope and raises the 
other foot lever. U.S. Patent No. 4,708,388 discloses 
a stair climbing apparatus which provides an 
independent step mode of operation. The left pedal is 
connected to a chain which passes over and engages the 
teeth of a sprocket. The end of the chain opposite the 
pedal is attached to a spring which passes over a 
pulley and then is firmly secured to the frame of the 
apparatus. The right pedal is similarly configured 
with its own independent actuating mechanism including 
a chain, a sprocket, a spring, and a pulley. The 
springs provide an upward lift which returns the pedals 
to an elevated position when no downward force acts on 
the pedals. However, since each pedal has its own 
actuating mechanism, the pedals operate independently 
of each other. U.S. Patent No. 4,949,993 also 
discloses a stair climbing apparatus which provides an 
independent step mode of operation. Each mode of operation, independent or 
dependent step mode,

<CLAIMS>
A step exercise apparatus (20) comprising a first foot 
operable mechanism (108) and a second foot operable 

mechanism (110) and means (182,184,186) for coordinating 
the mechanisms (108,110) so that the mechanisms are 

operable independently of one another or are 
interdependent characterised in that the said means 

(182,184,186) is adapted to be controlled by a user 
separately from operation of the mechanisms (108,110) to 

select whether operation of the mechanisms (108,110) is 
to be independent or interdependent. 
Apparatus (20) as claimed in Claim 1 characterised in 
that the mechanisms (108,110) each comprise a rotary 

member (108,110) and the rotary members (108,110) are 
adapted to engage one with another so as to rotate in 

unison on a common axis and are adapted to disengage one 
from another so as to rotate independently of one another 

on the axis, engagement and disengagement of the rotary 
members (108,110) being effected by operation of the said 

means (182,184,186). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that the 
said means (182,184,186) includes a connector 

(182,184,186) for disengagably connecting the rotary 
members (108,110) one to another. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 characterised in that the 
 

connector (182,184,186) comprises a plurality of pins 
(184,186) and each of the rotary members (108,110) 

includes a plurality of apertures (148,150,152;

Apparatus as claimed in Claim 4 characterised in that the 
said means (182,184,186) includes an engaging biasing 

device (202) for biasing the connector (182,184,186) so 
that pins (184, 186) engage in the apertures

has been selected. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5 characterised in that 
the said means (182,184,186) includes a disengaging 

biasing device (178) for biasing the connector 
(182,184,186) so that the pins (184,186) disengage from 

the apertures (148,150,152; 158,160,162) when an 
independent mode has been selected. 
Apparatus as claimed in claims 5 or 6 characterised in 
that the said means (182,184,186) includes a user 

operable lever (222). 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 7 characterised in that the 
lever (222) is biased for urging interengagement of the 

pins (184, 186) in the apertures (148,150,152; 
158,160,162) when the mechanisms (108,110) are in an 

interdependent mode and for urging disengagement of the 

pins (184,186) from the apertures (148,150,152; 
 

158,160,162) when the mechanisms (108,110) are in 
independent mode. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of Claims 2 to 8 
characterised in that the rotary members (108,110) are 

biased against rotation on the common axis. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 9 characterised in that the 
rotary members (108,110) are biased by means of a spring 

(168) common to both rotary members (108,110).
