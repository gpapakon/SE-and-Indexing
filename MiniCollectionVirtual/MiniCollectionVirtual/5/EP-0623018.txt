<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a drip-feed method for the manufacture of soft gelatin capsules, the preferably soft or liquid contents being enclosed in soft gelatin which is then solidified in a low-temperature cooling bath containing a chemically inert liquified gas which leaves no biologically undesirable or toxic residues on the capsules. Liquid nitrogen is preferably used as the cooling-bath liquid.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of soft gelatin 
capsules by a drip-feed process, the filling material 

being covered with a soft gelatin composition and being 
introduced into a cooling bath to solidify the gelatin 

composition, characterized in that, for shaping, a 
cooling bath is used which contains a deep-cooled 

liquefied gas which does not leave behind any biologically 
unacceptable or harmful residue on the soft 

gelatin capsule. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a liquefied gas having a boiling range from -70°C to 

-220°C is employed. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the liquefied gas employed is liquid air. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that liquid nitrogen is employed. 
Process according to one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that the filling material is selected 

from the group consisting of: pharmaceutical substances, 
active compounds, dietetic foodstuffs, cosmetics, liquid 

substances, pasty substances, substances containing suspended 
constituents, emulsions, microencapsulated substances; 

and their mixtures. 
Process according to one of Claims 1-5, characterized 
in that an active compound is added both to the 

gelatin shell and to the filling material or as filling 
material. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that a different active compound is added to the filling 

material or as filling material than is added to the  
 

gelatin shell. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a plasticizer is added to the filling material, 

selected from the group consisting of: glycerol, 
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, triacetin, 

sorbitol, sorbitan mixtures; and their mixtures. 
Process according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the filling material and the gelatin shell contain 

the plasticizer in approximately equal concentrations. 
Process according to one of Claims 1-9, characterized 
in that the gelatin employed is a sol/gel-forming 

gelatin having a Bloom number of about 50 to 300 Bloom. 
Process according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that a gelatin is used selected from the group consisting 

of: fractionated gelatin, gelatin derivatives, collagen 
hydrolysates; and their mixtures. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that substances are added to the filling material which 

make possible controlled release from the filling 
material, the substances being selected from the group 

consisting of: poly- and methacrylic acid derivatives, 
alginates, aldoses, citral, cellulose derivatives, 

polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, 
agar-agar, pectins; and their mixtures, 

hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate, azo-crosslinked 
polymethacrylates, 
polyurethane/sugar copolymers, a 
suitable sugar component in particular being oligomeric 

galactomannans or galactomannan derivatives which are 
then crosslinked with aliphatic diisocyanates, galactomannan 

derivatives such as ethyl- or acetylgalactomannans 
and polysaccharides crosslinked with adipic acid. 
Process according to one of Claims 8-12, characterized 
in that the filling material employed is a 

pharmaceutical substance. 
Process according to one of Claims 8-12, characterized 
in that the filling material employed is a 

dietetic foodstuff. 
Process according to one of Claims 8-12, characterized 
in that the filling material employed is a  

 
cosmetic. 
Process according to one of Claims 1-15, characterized 
in that the soft gelatin composition is mixed 

with a customary gastric juice-resistant substance and/or 
the soft gelatin capsule is provided with an enteric 

coating.
