<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a method for avoiding a collision between a motor vehicle and an obstruction, in the case of which collision the output signal from a separation measuring device (which has a plurality of scanning beams which are emitted in a fan shape in the direction of movement of the motor vehicle and to the sides of said direction) is fed to an evaluation unit, the output signal from a lock angle sensor (steering angle sensor) is also supplied to the evaluation unit. The movement path of the motor vehicle is calculated and the obstruction is assessed with respect to the movement path of the motor vehicle in the evaluation unit. The obstruction is taken into account only if it enters the movement path of the motor vehicle.
