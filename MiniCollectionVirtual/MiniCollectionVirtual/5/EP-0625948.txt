<ABSTRACT>
A releasable cap (12) includes an inner cap surface and an inner peripheral wall, and a seal for forming a seal between the cap (12) and an upper edge of a rim of a structure (10). The seal extends from the inner cap surface and is arranged concentric with respect to the inner peripheral wall so as to form a gap (18) between the outer edge and the inner peripheral wall for receiving the upper edge of the rim. A flange (14) integrally connects the cap to the structure (10) wherein the flange is formed from a flexible material so as to permit bending of the flange so that the cap (12) can move from a first position wherein it is seated on the strucuture to a second position wherein it is not seated on the structure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sealing structures for pour spouts and vials;
and more particularly to a seal and method for releasably sealing a cap onto a
structure such as a pour spout or vial.Resealable caps are well known in the art. Such caps may be used on gabled
top containers and brick type containers. See Figures 11 and 12, respectively, of
U.S. Patent No. 5,108,029. In addition, caps of a similar style have been used to
seal vials of different sizes and shapes. See, for example, Figure 4 of U.S. Patent
No. 4,783,056. Such caps are convenient because they form a liquid-tight seal and
can be repeatedly opened and closed easily.For purposes of convenience, such caps are frequently integrally connected to
the structure that they are intended to seal. For example, they may be connected by
a flexible flange that allows the cap to pivot from an opened position to a sealed
position.In order to enhance the seal between the cap and the structure or container
onto which the cap is fastened, an annular seal may be provided within the cap in
order to form an annular gap between the seal and the outer rim of the cap. The
annular gap is designed to receive an upper edge of the container onto which the cap
is sealed. In order to obtain a good, liquid-tight seal between the container and the
cap, it is preferable that the upper edge of the container wall fit tightly within the
annular gap. However, fitting the upper edge of the container wall tightly within
the annular gap creates difficulties. Specifically, if the cap is not properly aligned
with the container immediately prior to closing, the upper edge of the container wall
may improperly contact the annular seal or outer rim of the cap, thus bending or
damaging the seal, the outer rim of the cap, or the upper edge of the container wall. 
In addition, if the annular gap is too narrow, the upper edge of the container wall may
not fit properly within the gap, thus also creating problems with the seal.Caps of the type to which the present invention relates are generally injection
molded from plastic.The invention provides a fluid-tight seal arrangement for a resealable cap for use
with a vial comprising:
(a) a flange integrally connecting the cap to the vial, the flange including a
recess to direct bending of the flange with proper alignment of the cap on an upper edge
of the vial, the recess extending in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of
the flange,(b) an annular seal extending from the inner cap surface, the annular seal
including an

A fluid-tight seal arrangement for a resealable cap for use with a vial comprising:

(a) a flange integrally connecting the cap to the vial, the flange including a
recess (222,322) to direct bending of the flange with proper alignment of the cap on an

upper edge of the vial, the recess extending in a direction perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis of the flange,
(b) an annular seal (216,316) extending from the inner cap surface(238,328),
the annular seal including an inner edge (232,332) and an outer edge (234,334), the

outer edge of the seal extending toward the inner cap surface at an angle of
approximately 45 degrees, the annular seal being concentric with respect to the inner

peripheral wall (246,346) of the cap so as to form a gap between the outer edge of the
seal and the inner peripheral wall for receiving an upper edge of a rim of the vial, the

inner peripheral wall of the cap including first and second sections (246,244,346,344), the
first section (246,346) being normal to the inner cap surface and the second section

(244,344) forming a ridge that protrudes from the first section for contacting the upper
edge of the rim of the vial, characterised in that


(1) the flange includes an elongate ridge (224,324) which extends in a direction
perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flange;
(2) the annular seal has a truncated top surface (236,336),
(3) the inner edge of the seal intersects the inner cap surface at an angle of
approximately 45 degrees,
(4) the width of the seal at its base is at least twice the height of the seal,
(5) the first section (246,346) of the inner peripheral wall of the cap is
substantially the same height as the sea]
 (216,316) so that the truncated top surface
(236,336) of the seal ends at approximately the same height as the end of the first section

of the wall,

whereby the annular seal design and inner wall arrangement result in the upper edge of
the rim of the vial contacting the cap at least along the first wall section, along the

second wall section and at the outer seal wall when the upper edge is sealed within the
cap.
