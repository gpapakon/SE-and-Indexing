<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with the decomposition of nitrogen oxides 
and their catalytic reduction to nitrogen. Nitrogen oxides are a series of gases having the general formula NOx, and 
include nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and various complex oxides such 
as nitrogen tetroxide. These reactive gases form in varying amounts during virtually 
all combustion of fuel in the presence of air, and particularly during high-temperature 
combustion. The combustion that occurs in internal combustion 
engines, incinerators, coal or oil fired power plants and the like is a significant 
source. Other sources are industrial, such as processes for making nitric acid or for 
forming nitrates or nitro groups. Nitrogen oxides are highly reactive, and through 
reactions with hydrocarbons and the like form a complex variety of air pollutants 
referred to as photochemical oxidants. Thus, reduction or elimination of nitrogen 
oxide emission into the atmosphere is an important aspect of air pollution control. Typical reactions involved in the decomposition of nitrogen oxides are 
exemplified by the following reactions, in which the nitrogen oxides are represented 
by nitric oxide: 
(a) decomposition of nitric oxide directly to nitrogen and oxygen. 
2 NO → N2 + O2 (b) reduction of nitric oxide in the presence of a reducing agent but in the 
absence of oxygen. 
4 NO + CH4 → 2 N2 + CO2 +2 H2O(c) reduction of nitric oxide in the presence of a reducing agent and oxygen. 
2 NO + CH4 + O2 → N2 + CO2 + 2 H2OThese reactions are catalyzed in the prior art by precious-metal catalysts, for 
example, platinum. These catalysts are rare and expensive, given the widespread 
need for pollution control through NOx decomposition. To encourage a more 
widespread use of nitrogen-oxide-decomposition technology, with its resulting 
benefits to air quality, a decomposition catalyst which uses smaller amounts of 
metals, or uses less expensive metals, would be particularly advantageous. A 
further advantage would be realized by providing a catalyst that would maximize 
conversion to nitrogen and minimize formation of N2O. The DE-A-3 727 643 describes a process for decomposition 
of NOx with an carbonaceous adsorbent containing first row 
transition metal oxides.  
 According to the present invention there is provided a process for low-temperature 
decomposition of nitrogen oxides, which comprises contacting one or 
more nitrogen oxide, at a temperature of from 100°C to 450°C, with one or more  
 
metal oxide selected from
