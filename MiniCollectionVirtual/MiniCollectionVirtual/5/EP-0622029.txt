<CLAIMS>
Method for processing a foodstuff having an
aqueous phase to form a prepared foodstuff which

contains enzymatically broken-down, mouth feel and/or
pharmacologically effective vegetable constituents,

characterised in that the non broken-down vegetable
constituents are mixed into the foodstuff together with

the enzymes during the preparation.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the vegetable constituents are added together with

the enzymes after a mechanical comminution, for example
grinding.
Method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the vegetable constituents and

the enzymes are first added to a portion of the
foodstuff, and after the start of breaking-down, mixing

to form the finished foodstuff is carried out.
Method according to one or more of the
preceding claims, characterised in that the vegetable

constituents and the enzymes are mixed thoroughly
together before they are supplied to the foodstuff and,

in fine distribution, are encapsulated in a coating.
Method according to claim 4, characterised by
monosaccharides, disaccharides or polysaccharides as

coating substances.
Method according to claim 4, characterised by
thickening agents, for example guar, agar-agar,

xanthan, as the coating substance.
Method according to claim 4, characterised by
salts as the coating substance.
Method according to claim 4, characterised by
fats as the coating substance.
Method according to claim 4, characterised by
