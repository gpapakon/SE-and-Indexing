<ABSTRACT>
A rotary viscosity pump (10) is provided that has a housing (12) 
and an 

impeller (14). The housing (12) has a conical chamber (22) with an 
outlet (20) at 

a narrow end of the chamber. The impeller (14) has a conical 
section (30) with a logarithmic spiral groove (32) along its exterior. 

The spacing between the housing and the impeller can have 
either a constant gap or a gap that decreases along the length 

of the impeller. The depth of the groove can be constant, 
increase, or decrease in depth along the length of the 

impeller.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pumps and, more particularly, 
to a rotary viscosity pump. U.S. Patent 1,448,079 to Noeggerath discloses a viscosity pump 
with a rotary body having spiral grooves with both constant 
and varying depth. U.S. Patent 1,448,080 to Noeggerath 
discloses a pumping body for viscosity pumps with curved 
pumping grooves. U.S. Patent 3,762,313 to Schott, Jr. and 
French patent 2,478,222 disclose feeding screws with helical 
flights. U.S. Patent 4,357,291 to Miller et al. discloses a 
screw with a radius of the screw root that changes along the 
length of the screw. U.S. Patent 4,047,705 to Hanslik 
discloses a pair of axially tapered screws. Viscosity pumps generally include a cylindrical rod turning 
inside of a fitted sleeve that causes material to move along 
the interface propelled by the shear between the sleeve and 
the surface of the rod. This type of pump is standardly used 
for high viscosity materials such as crude oil and plastics 
for injection molds. However, viscosity pumps include 
problems of low efficiency (requiring large motors), large 
size (none are currently available less than a foot long), and 
large compressed volumes which leads to poor time response. There are no pump technologies today that combine the 
following characteristics: 1) small size [less than 32.8 cm3 (2 cubic 
inches)], 2) high temperature compatibility (232Â°C/450 degrees F), 3) 
fast time response (less than 0.03 seconds to full pressure),  
 
4) compatible with a wide range of viscosities (10 to 100,000 
centipoise), and 5) low pressure variations during operation 
(less than 0.5% rms). According to the invention there is provided a viscosity pump as defined 
in claim 1, and a system using the same as 
defined in claim 8. Advantageous embodiments of the invention 
are defined in the dependent claims. The 
viscosity pump comprises a housing and an 
impeller. The housing has a pump chamber and an outlet. The 
chamber has a section with a general conical shape. The 
outlet is located at the narrow end of the chamber section. 
The impeller is rotatably located in the chamber and has a 
general conical section with at least one logarithmic spiral 
groove along an exterior of the conical section.  
 The foregoing aspects and other features of the invention are 
explained in the following description, taken in connection 
with the accompanying drawings, wherein: Fig. 1 is a schematic sectional view of a pump incorporating 
features of the present invention. Fig. 1a is a diagram of a cone used
