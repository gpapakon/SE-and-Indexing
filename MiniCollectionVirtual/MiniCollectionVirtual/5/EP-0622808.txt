<ABSTRACT>
Programming procedure and device for electrically reprogrammable non-volatile memory (1) associated with a processor (3) with which is also conventionally associated a random-access memory (4), the one and the other being necessary in operating this processor in a specified manner. In order to load the permanent data necessary for operating the processor into non-volatile memory (1), a memory enable signal provided by the processor is routed to a temporarily connected auxiliary memory (7) so as to boot this processor from initialising data contained in the auxiliary memory, to transfer into random-access memory the data which, present in auxiliary memory, correspond to the data to be recorded in the non-volatile memory, before transferring them to the latter from the random-access memory, after the processor has disabled the auxiliary memory.
