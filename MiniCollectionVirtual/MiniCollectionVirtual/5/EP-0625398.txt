<ABSTRACT>
The milling tool according to the invention comprises a fastening shank (1) secured to a milling head (2) equipped with at least two cutting edges (3, 4). The cutting edges (3, 4) include peripheral edge portions (6, 8) made of a first, hard, material which can cut at a high cutting speed, and include central edge portions (5, 7) made of a second, hard, material which can cut at a relatively low cutting speed. The first hard material is, for example, cubic boron nitride. The second hard material is, for example, a sintered carbide. Such a tool is designed for high cutting speeds, for example for machining hard materials.
