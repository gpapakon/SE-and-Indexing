<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
radiation site detector which can detect a position of 

an incident scintillator with high precision by 
excluding the effect of Compton scattering. The 

radiation site detector is provided with a scintillator 
array having a plurality of scintillators into which a 

radiation is made incident, and a photodetector for 
converting scintillations occurring in the 

scintillators to independent photoelectric conversion 
signals to output them. A level of each of 

photoelectric conversion signals output from a specific 
scintillator to be judged whether the radiation has 

been incident thereinto, and from a plurality of 
scintillators around the specific scintillator, is 

compared with a plurality of threshold values different 
from one another so as to determine whether the levels 

are within or outside a window defined by the threshold 
values. Then, it is judged whether the above specific 

scintillator is a scintillator into which the radiation 
has been incident based on the characteristics of a 

signal pattern obtained in the above comparison.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a radiation
site detector. An apparatus embodying the invention
obtains a tomographic image of a detected matter by
introducing radioisotopes (RI) into the matter and then
detecting a radiation from the radioisotopes by means of a
scintillation detector. The radiation site
detector may be used to detect a site where the radiation
has entered the scintillation detector.A positron CT apparatus is known as an example of such
apparatus to obtain a tomographic image of a detected
matter, and has been popular as a high-level medical
technique to obtain a tomographic image of a living body in
which positron emission nuclei are introduced into the
living body and a distribution thereof is measured by a
scintillation detector.Generally, the positron CT apparatus is equipped with
a scintillation detector having a number of scintillators
arranged in a ring layout, in which the body dosed with the
positron emission nuclei is set. Near a positron-emitted
area, a positron emitted from the positron emission nuclei
is combined with an electron to 
disappear and two 511 keV radiation rays (Î³-rays) are
simultaneously emitted in opposite directions to each
other. Thus, the annihilation site near the positron
emission nuclei can be detected by the coincidence
counting of these two radiation rays through two mutually
opposed scintillators. A tomographic image is obtained
through image reconstruction based on the thus-detected
data.Further, in order to detect the annihilation site
near the positron emission nuclei, a position of each
radiation-entering scintillator (hereinafter, referred
to simply as "incident scintillator") among a plurality
of scintillators needs to be determined. The centroid
position calculating method has been mainly applied in
the conventional radiation site detecting apparatus.Fig. 13 is a drawing to show an example of
conventional radiation position detecting apparatus
employing the above-described centroid position
calculating method. The scintillation detector is
provided with a scintillator array 1 having many
scintillators arranged in a two-dimensional array, and
two-dimensional-crossed-wire-position-sensitive
photomultipliers arranged as opposed thereto on the back
side of the scintillator array 1. In the
two-dimensional-cross-wire-position-detection
photomultipliers, wires in the X coordinate direction and 
in the Y coordinate direction are connected with
interposed resistors. Further, an adder (adding circuit)
2x adds output signals x1 and x2 appearing
