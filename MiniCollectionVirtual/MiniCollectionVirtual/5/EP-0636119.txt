<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel phenylsubstituted cycloalkyl N-hydroxyurea 
derivatives. The compounds of the present invention inhibit the action of the 
enzyme lipoxygenase and are useful in the treatment or alleviation of inflammatory 
diseases, allergy and cardiovascular diseases in mammals. This invention also 
relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and to the use 
of such compounds in treating inflammatory diseases, allergy and cardiovascular 
diseases in mammals. This invention further relates to methods of making such 
compounds. Arachidonic acid is known to be the biological precursor of several groups of 
endogenous metabolites, prostaglandins including prostacyclins, thromboxanes and 
leukotrienes. The first step of arachidonic acid metabolism is the release of 
arachidonic acid and related unsaturated fatty acids from membrane phospholipids, 
via the action of phospholipase. Free fatty acids are then metabolized either by 
cyclooxygenase to produce the prostaglandins and thromboxanes or by 
lipoxygenase to generate hydroperoxy fatty acids which may be further converted to 
the leukotrienes. Leukotrienes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, gout, asthma, ischemia 
reperfusion injury, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease. Any drug that inhibits 
lipoxygenase is expected to provide significant new therapy for both acute and 
chronic inflammatory conditions. Several review articles on lipoxygenase inhibitors have been reported (See H. 
Masamune et al., Ann. Rev. Med. Chem., 24, 71-80 (1989) and B.J. Fitzsimmons et 
al., Leukotrienes and Lipoxygenases, 427-502 (1989). Compounds of the same general class as the compounds of the present 
invention are disclosed in EP 279263 A2, EP 196184 A2, EP 0436199 Al, JP 
(Kohyo) 502179/88 and U.S. patent No. 4,822,809.  
 The present invention provides ncvel phenylsubstituted cycloalkyl N-hydroxyurea 
derivatives of the following formula: 
 
wherein 
A is C1 to C4 alkylene or C2 to C6 alkenylene; each B is independently halogen, C1 to C4 alkyl, C2 to C8 alkoxyalkyl or 
halosubstituted C1 to C4 alkyl; X is methylene or ethylene; M is hydrogen or a pharmaceutically acceptable cation; Ar is mono-, di or tri-substituted phenyl wherein the substituents are 
independently selected from halogen, C1 to C4 alkyl, C1 to C4 alkoxy, halosubstituted 
C1-C4 alkyl, (C1-C4 alkyl)phenoxy, (C1-C4 alkoxy)phenoxy, halosubstituted phenoxy, 
halosubstituted (C1 to C4 alkyl)phenoxy,
