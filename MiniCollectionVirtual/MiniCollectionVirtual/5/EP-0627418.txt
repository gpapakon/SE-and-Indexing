<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to methods for the 
preparation of N-unsubstituted 2-azetidinones, and to novel 
compounds useful in said methods. Taxol, a compound isolated from the bark of Pacific yew 
trees, has recently emerged as a promising anticancer drug, 
particularly in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Because taxol is 
only present in small quantity in the bark of the slow-growing 
Pacific yew, there is a continuing interest in a practical synthetic or 
semi-synthetic route to taxol in order to meet the increasing 
demand for the drug without unduly burdening the Pacific yew 
population. U.S. Patent 5,175,315 issued to R.A. Holton on December 29, 
1992 discloses the coupling of protected baccatin III with protected 
N-benzoyl-3-hydroxy-4-phenyl-2-azetidinone (A) to give taxol. 
In U.S. 5,175,315 it is disclosed that 3-acetoxy-4-phenyl-2-azetidinone 
(B), a precursor to (A), is prepared by reacting 
acetoxyacetyl chloride with N-benzylidene-4-methoxyaniline to 
give N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-acetoxy-4-phenyl-2-azetidinone, 
followed by removal of the 4-methoxyphenyl group with cerium 
ammonium nitrate (CAN). This process is also applicable to the 
synthesis of 2-azetidinones with other 3- and 4-substituents. 
The above process for the preparation of β-lactam (B) requires the 
use of large quantity of CAN, rendering it impractical as a large 
scale manufacturing process. Therefore, there is the need for an 
improved process for the preparation of 3,4-disubstituted-2-azetidinones 
that is amenable to scale-up production. Manhas et al, in "Cyanuric Chloride: A Mild Reagent for 
β-Lactam Synthesis" Synthesis, 1981, 209-211, reports the synthesis 
of 3-azido-4-phenyl-2-azetidinone from potassium azidoacetate, 
hydrobenzamide and cyanuric acid in the presence of 
triethylamine, followed by treatment with 10% HCl. Wells and Lee 
in "The Synthesis of 2-Azetidinones" J. Org. Chem., 1969, 34:1477-1479 
reports the synthesis of 3-azido-4-phenyl (and substituted 
phenyl)-2-azetidinone from azidoacetyl chloride and 
hydrobenzamide in the presence of triethylamine, followed by 
treatment with 10% HCl. Neither Manhas nor Wells discloses the 
isolation of the cycloaddition product; indeed it is reported later  
 
(see Synthesis, Sept. 1975, at p. 557) that the cycloaddition product is 
the dimeric azetidinone (C). 
The present invention provides novel cis-N-iminomethyl-3,4-disubstituted-β-lactams

wherein R¹ is selected from the group consisting of alkyl, halo-substituted
