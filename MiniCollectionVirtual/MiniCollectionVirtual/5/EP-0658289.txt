<ABSTRACT>
A temperature monitoring process and device are disclosed for controlling the operation of an electric consumer in such a way that overheating is avoided at the same time as means connected downstream of the appliance or a user are not strongly affected. For that purpose, a temperature threshold is provided above which an economical operation mode is switched in, reducing power consumption and further heating. The invention can be used for example in video-recorders.

Method of monitoring the temperature of an apparatus 
incorporating output stages for a plurality of loads, wherein 

the loads (13, 14) 

are driven normally within a temperature range for normal 
operation and 
are driven at reduced power within a temperature range for a 
warning mode so that a predetermined operational state is 

thereby achieved, 
 
and wherein there are additionally provided one or more 

temperature ranges for an economiser mode between the 
temperature range for normal operation and the temperature 

range for the warning mode, characterised in that, only certain 
loads (13, 14) of the apparatus are driven at reduced power in 

the temperature range for the economiser mode and one or more 
other loads of the apparatus are driven without any reduction 

in power, whereby the selection of these loads (13, 14) is 
effected such that, on the one hand, one avoids to a large 

extent critical operating temperatures from being exceeded and, 
on the other hand, such that any detrimental effect upon the 

means co-operating with the apparatus is reduced. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that, 
only the power for those loads having a high power consumption 

is reduced in the economiser mode. 
Method in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that, the power is reduced continuously or step-by-step in the 

economiser mode. 
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that, the currently occurring temperature 

range is indicated optically and/or acoustically.  
 
Method in accordance with any of the Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that, there is additionally provided above the 

temperature range for the warning mode a temperature range for 
an alarm mode within which the loads are switched-off. 
Device for monitoring the temperature of an apparatus using 
temperature sensors and appropriate temperature comparison 

means which co-operate with a control device (10) and control 
output stages in such a way that a plurality of loads (13, 14) 


are driven normally within a temperature range for normal 
operation and 
are driven at reduced power within a temperature range for a 
warning mode so that a predetermined operational state is 

thereby achieved, 
 
and wherein the control device (10) additionally defines one or 

more temperature ranges for an economiser mode between the 

temperature range for normal operation and the temperature 
range for the warning mode, characterised in that, the control 

device (10) controls only certain loads (13, 14) of the 
apparatus such as to provide reduced power in the temperature 

range for the economiser mode and controls one or more other 
loads of the apparatus at unreduced power, whereby the 

selection of these loads (13, 14) is effected such that, on the 
one hand, one avoids to a large extent critical operating 

temperatures from being exceeded and, on the other hand, such 
that any detrimental effect upon the means co-operating with 

the apparatus is reduced. 
Device in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that, in 
the economiser mode, the control device (10) only controls 

those output stages (11) so as to provide reduced power, for 
which said output stages their loads have a high power 

consumption.  
 
Device in accordance with Claim 6 or 7, characterised in 
that, the control device (10) controls the output stages (11) 

in such a way that the power is reduced continuously or step-by-step 
in the economiser mode. 
Device in accordance with any of the Claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that, there are provided indicating means 

which indicate the currently occurring temperature range 
optically and/or acoustically. 
Device in accordance with any of the Claims 6 to 9, 
characterised in that, the temperature comparison means are 

constructed in such a way that there is additionally provided 
above the temperature range for the warning mode a temperature 

range for an alarm mode within which the loads are switched-off.
