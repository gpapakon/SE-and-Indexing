<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method for reshaping (transforming) textile sheet materials composed of pure natural fibres or a fibre blend by exposing the textile sheet material to sodium hydroxide solution at a concentration of 30 DEG  Bé at a temperature of 60 DEG C, treating the textile sheet material for a certain period until a desired shrinkage process has occurred, then removing the sodium hydroxide solution mechanically, especially by squeezing, then mechanically forming the textile sheet material into a new shape, completely removing the rest of the sodium hydroxide solution, and end-treating the textile sheet material in accordance with the subsequent use.

Method for transforming planar textile articles (7',
7'') from cellulose-containing natural fibres or cellulose-containing

mixed fibres with the following steps:

treatment of the planar textile article (7', 7'') with
a lye until a desired shrinkage process has occurred,
mechanical removal of the lye by squeezing out,
mechanical deformation of the planar article (7', 7''),
removal of the remaining lye by washing out, adding
neutralising agents or a combination thereof while the

planar textile article (7', 7'') is fixed in shaping
relationship, and
final treatment of the planar textile article (7, 7'')
according to subsequent use.
Method for transforming planar textile articles (7',
7'') from cellulose-containing natural fibres or cellulose-containing

mixed fibres with the following steps:

mechanical deformation of the planar article (7', 7''),
treatment of the planar textile article structure (7',
7'') with a lye while the planar textile article (7',

7'') is fixed in shaping relationship until a desired
shrinkage process has occurred,
removal of the lye by washing out, adding neutralising
agents or a combination thereof while the planar

textile article (7', 7'') is fixed in shaping
relationship, and
final treatment of the planar textile article (7', 7'')
according to subsequent use.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
transformation of the planar textile article (7', 7'') takes

place by forge forming (8), roll forming, blow forming,
vacuum forming or shrinking on.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 3, wherein an 
organic or inorganic lye is used, in particular a soda lye.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 4, wherein the
planar textile article (7', 7'') is subjected to a

neutralizing process with water and/or acid to remove the
remaining lye.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 5, wherein the
lye used is a soda lye with a concentration of about 30 Bé.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 6, wherein the
lye used is a soda lye with a temperature of abou
t 60°C.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 7, wherein the
planar textile article (7', 7'') is removed from the mould

for the final treatment.
Method according to any of claims 1 - 7, wherein the
planar textile article (7', 7'') is not removed from the

mould for the final treatment.
Planar transformed textile article, made according to
any of the above claims 1 - 9, characterized in that it is

formaldehyde-free.
Planar transformed textile article, made according to
any of the above claims 1 - 9, characterized in that it is

free from chemicals.
