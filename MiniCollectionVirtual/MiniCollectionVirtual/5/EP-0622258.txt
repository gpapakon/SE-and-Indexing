<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a rear window pane (1) which can be inserted into the folding-top fabric (7) of a cabriolet-type vehicle and is made of strong glass. It is envisaged that the strong-glass pane (1) be provided with a plastic connecting element (4) which is attached to its edge region and can be firmly connected to the folding-top fabric (7) by means of high-frequency welding (6). This renders unnecessary any additional reinforcing frame and the advantages of a plastic window pane are thus combined with the longevity and stability of glass.

with a synthetic plastics connecting element applied to the 

marginal portion and which can be rigidly connected to the 
soft top fabric (7) by high frequency welding. 
A rear windscreen according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the synthetic plastics connecting element is 

constructed as a profiled rod (4, 9). 
A rear windscreen according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the profiled rod (4, 9) consists of extruded 

PVC (polyvinylchloride) or TPE (thermoplastic elastomers 
with an increased rubber content). 
A rear windscreen according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a coupling agent (3) (e.g. Iack) is 

applied to the rim area of the rigid glass pane (1) and in 
that the profiled rod (4) is applied to the coupling agent 

(3). 
A rear windscreen according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the profiled rod (4') has a lip (14) which engages 

around or underneath the rigid glass pane (1). 
A rear windscreen according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the profiled rod (9) which is welded 

to the soft top fabric by high frequency welding is 
connected to the window by means of an adhesive (8) which is 

applied to the rim area of the windscreen (1).  
 
A rear windscreen according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that receiving elements for the connection 

of tractive connecting means (tensioning straps) and 
receiving elements for the rear windscreen guide are glued 

onto the inside of the rear windscreen (1) by means of a 
single or bi-component glue.
