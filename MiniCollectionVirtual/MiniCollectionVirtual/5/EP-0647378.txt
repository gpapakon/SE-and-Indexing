<ABSTRACT>
A communication network (10) between various data processing devices (150) is formed as a pair of fiber optic segments (12, 14 and 22, 24) each terminating at an interface (110) which also is tied to the local data processing station. The interface (110) includes terminating receiver-transmitter pairs (52, 62 and 54, 64) at the adjacent ends of the fibers to relay signal in a first direction on one of the fibers and in a second direction on the other fiber. When the local processing station (150) actively enters the communication stream on the network the receivers (52 and 54) of each pair are logically tied to each other as are the transmitters (62 and 64). Thus, relay of all other network signals across the interface (110) is interrupted when the local processing station (150) commences its own communication with the network.

<DESCRIPTION>
 BIDIRECTIONAL DATA COMMUNICATION SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 'Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to data communication networks and, more particularly, to interfaces conformed for connecting a data processing system to a bidirectional network in which the communication directions are separated by channel. Reference to Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 08/011,685 filed on February 1, 1993 entitled "Bidirectional Data Communication System" . Description of the Prior ArtCommunication between data processing terminals, central data bank storage facilities, and central processing stations is a matter of increasing concern as various personal computers and work stations are multiplied. As the density of these competing stations increases, the burden imposed on the communication network increases exponentially. Thus, the bandwidth of the communication network, the interfaces with the devices tied to it, and the communications protocols of each communicating device all need fundamental attention in order to avoid logical mazes and logical indeterminants.Characteristically, each data processing device either transmits data onto a network, or receives data from it. Between these two communication states an active data processing device may effect internal operations of only a few or a large number of switching cycles and thereafter may require, again, the further use of a network. The third alternative, where the data processing device is idle or passive, is insignificant to the communication burden imposed.
 Since the network itself is normally incapable of any data processing, a complete network architecture requires that for each transmission there be at least one receiver, and that for each receiver there be at least one transmitter. In consequence, each of the devices actively on the network must resolve the status of the network data that is to be received, and also the status of the network for transmission. One further condition, a condition not logically determined at the processing device, is the geometric arrangement between any two devices communicating on the network.As the number of those using data processing devices and terminals increased the communication burden on any common network also increased. Furthermore, the proliferation of personal computers was then followed by an increase in the facility of their use. Thus, it is not just the number of stations on a network but also the task complexity and the
