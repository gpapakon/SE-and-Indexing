<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to ignition systems, and 
more particularly to apparatus and methods for detecting and 
indicating the occurrence and type of discharges from an 
exciter circuit. Conventional ignition systems -are well known and 
typically include an exciter circuit having an energy storage 
device such as a capacitor and a circuit for charging the 
capacitor, one or more igniter plugs circuit, and a switching 
mechanism as part of a discharge circuit connected between the 
capacitor and the igniter. In aerospace applications, the 
switching mechanism commonly is a spark gap, or more recently 
solid state switches such as SCRs. A control circuit can be 
provided to control when the switching mechanism is triggered 
so that the energy stored in the capacitor can be discharged 
across the igniter plug. During the time that the switching 
device is open, the capacitor is charged by the charging 
circuit. The control circuit may include a timer circuit to 
control the spark rate. It is often desirable to know whether the ignition system 
is operating properly, particularly to know if the spark rate 
is being maintained. For example, spark rates can be 
significantly affected by operating temperature excursions or 
variations of input voltage or frequency. Also, various 
failure modes within the discharge circuits can prevent proper 
discharge of current through the igniter. Accordingly, many 
ignition diagnostic systems use a current transformer to 
detect discharge, typically through the high tension lead or 
return lead. The current transformer includes a wire coil on 
a high permeability core that surrounds the current lead. 
Discharge current through the ignition system cables induces 
a current in the transformer that can then be detected by the 
diagnostic system because the induced current is related to 
the occurrence of a discharge current. The current  
 
transformer, therefore, provides a way to detect the 
occurrence of a discharge. However, such discharge detection schemes essentially 
operate as a go/no-go type diagnostic signal. The signal can 
indicate whether a spark discharge occurred or not, but cannot 
provide any further information as to what may have caused the 
igniter not to fire. In many aerospace applications, more than one exciter 
circuit may be used per engine for ignition. In such 
circumstances, a simple go/no-go type diagnostic signal does 
not provide sufficient information when a spark discharge 
fails to occur. Although multiple diagnostic signals could be
