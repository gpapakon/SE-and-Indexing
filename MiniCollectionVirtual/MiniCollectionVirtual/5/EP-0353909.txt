<ABSTRACT>
A system and method is disclosed for controlling 
the printing of images displayed on multiple computer 

display terminals onto a single remote printer. The 
system, which can be described as a distributive video 

acquisition/control system, includes individual data 
conversion modules (video adaptors) proximately 

coupled to individual display terminals, a data 
re-conversion/multiplexer module located within or 

proximately coupled to the printer, and a fiber optic 
cable for serially linking the conversion and 

re-conversion modules. Each data conversion module 
includes an A/D (analog to digital) converter which 

converts parallel RGB (red, green, blue) analog video 
data (received from a terminal) to parallel RGB 

digital data, and an encoder which converts the 
parallel RGB digital data to coded serial digital data 

light pulses) for transmission over the fiber optic 
cable to the data reconversion module. Upon receipt 

of the serial data from the multiple conversion 
modules, the data reconversion module multiplexes and 

converts the serial data to parallel digital form, and 
stores the data in a frame buffer of the printer. The 

video acquisition/control system also includes a user 
interface or print control unit (module) which enables 

a user to easily calibrate the system and to enter 
print control information and receive, at his 

worksite, information about the status of the remote 
printer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to image 
transfer systems and, more particularly, to color 
video processors/controllers for linking multiple 
display terminals to individual remote printers. Many color video processors/controllers are 
available for controlling the transfer of analog video 
RGB (red, green, blue) data from multiple display 
terminals to a remote printer. The video controllers 
permit images displayed on the CRT (cathode ray tube) 
screens of the display terminals to be reproduced onto 
a print medium such as paper or transparency. Some of 
these prior art video controllers are currently 
available from CalComp Corporation, Seiko Corporation, 
Tektronix Corporation, and Versatec Corporation. One problem with many of the prior art systems 
is that they do not provide a convenient way for a 
user to specify and receive printer environmental 
information (i.e., specify printer control information 
and receive printer status information) at the user's 
worksite. Another problem in many prior art systems 
is cable attenuation, and associated video signal 
degradation and differential propagation velocities of 
the video signals, due to lengthy multi-cable coaxial 
coupling of the display terminal and printer. Still 
another problem of many prior art systems is the 
numerous, burdensome entries or responses-to-prompts 
the systems often require from the user. A further 
problem with many prior art systems is that  
 
replacement of the video controller often requires 
replacement of the printer and/or display system. What would be useful and very beneficial, 
therefore, is a video control system which would 
eliminate or substantially reduce the above-mentioned 
problems. In accordance with the illustrated preferred 
embodiment of the present invention, a distributive 
video acquisition/control system is disclosed having a 
data conversion module (video adapter) located 
proximate to the display terminal, a data 
re-conversion module (multiplexer/encoder decoder) 
located within or proximate to the printer, and a 
fiber optic cable (or optionally, but less preferred, 
a coaxial, infrared or other link) for serially 
linking the conversion and reconversion modules. The 
video control system includes a user interface or 
print control module which enables a user to enter 
print control information and receive printer status 
information at his worksite. The video adapter or data conversion module 
includes an A/D (analog to digital) converter which 
converts parallel RGB (red, green, blue)

(1) Method of controlling the printing of displayed 
images including the steps of: 

acquiring video parallel analog RGB data 
representing multiple displayed images; 

converting the RGB parallel analog data to 
parallel digital data; 

converting the parallel digital data to 
encoded serial digital data; 

transmitting the encoded serial digital 
data via a communications link; 

receiving and reconverting the transmitted 
data from serial form to parallel digital form; 

and 
storing the reconverted data for 

subsequent printing.
