<ABSTRACT>
A process for the processing of a colour-photographic silver-halide material whose silver-halide emulsions comprise at least 90 mol% of silver chloride, with the steps     (a) exposure,   (b) developments with a colour developer and   (c) treatment with H2O2 or a compound which liberates H2O2, in which the colour developer contains an antioxidant having a positive redox potential, measured against a Pt/Ag/AgCl electrode, is distinguished by increased sensitivity.

<CLAIMS>
Process for processing a colour photographic silver
halide material, the silver halide emulsions of which

consist of at least 90 mol.% silver chloride,
comprising the stages


(a) exposure,
(b) development with a colour developer,
(c) treatment with H
2
O
2
 or a compound which releases
H
2
O
2
,

characterised in that the only anti-oxidants present
in the colour developer are those having a positive

redox potential, measured at 20Â°C with platinum as the
measuring electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference

electrode in an aqueous solution containing 6 g/l of
the anti-oxidant.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the redox potential is +50 to +500 mV.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the anti-oxidant is used in a quantity of 1 to 15 g,

preferably of 3 to 9 g/l of developer solution.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the anti-oxidant is a hydroxylamine salt.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that no
bleaching stage is performed.
