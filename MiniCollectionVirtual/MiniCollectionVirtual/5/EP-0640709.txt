<ABSTRACT>
In the cylinder-bed type sewing machine of the 
invention, a cylinder unit 4 is formed into a cylindrical 

shape. A feed base support 11, a feed base 9, and a feed 
dog 8 which are disposed in the cylindrical cylinder unit 

4 are reciprocally rotated in vertical and lengthwise 
directions in accordance with movements of a feed lifting 

rock shaft 16 and a feed lengthwise shaft 17. The 
vertical and lengthwise reciprocal movements of the feed 

base 9 are synthesized so that the feed dog 8 is moved 
along an arcuate feeding locus. According to the cylinder-bed 

type sewing machine of the invention, the 
peripheral length of the cylindrical cylinder unit 
4 for 
holding a tubular sewing product which is fitted onto the 

cylinder unit, and the distance between a throat plate 7 
and the left end of the cylinder unit 4 can be reduced as 

much as possible, and the feed dog 8 can be moved along 
the arcuate locus. Therefore, a predetermined feeding 

operation on the sewing product can be conducted surely 
and smoothly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cylinder-bed type 
sewing machine which is preferably used for stitching 
tubular sewing products such as cuffs of trousers, or 
sleeve edges of a T-shirt, and more particularly to an 
improved driving mechanism for a feed dog which allows a 
cylinder unit to be formed into a cylindrical shape so 
that a tubular sewing product is sewn while being fitted 
onto the cylinder unit, and the tubular sewing product to 
be fed rearward along the outer periphery of the cylindrical 
cylinder unit. Conventionally, such a cylinder-bed type sewing 
machine is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent 
Applicatin Laying-Open Nos. 62-240,093 and 4-20,372. The 
disclosed sewing machines are provided with a cylinder 
unit which is formed into a substantially rectangular 
box-like shape. A throat plate is disposed on the upper 
face of the substantially rectangular box-like cylinder 
unit, and a feed dog is disposed so that a sewing product  
 
on the throat plate is fed rearward in synchronization 
with the vertical motion of a sewing needle. The feed dog 
is configured so as to circulate along a locus which is 
substantially rectangular. In such a prior art cylinder-bed type sewing 
machine, usually, a tubular sewing product is fitted onto 
the cylinder unit to be held thereon and then subjected 
to the sewing operation. In such a prior art example in 
which the cylinder unit is formed into a substantially 
rectangular box-like shape, the cylinder unit has a large 
peripheral length. When a sewing product having a small 
peripheral length, such as a sleeve edge of a children's 
wear is to be sewn, therefore, it is impossible to fit 
the sewing product onto the cylinder unit to be held 
thereon. Consequently, the kinds of sewing products which 
can be sewn by the sewing machine are restricted, and 
hence the sewing machine has a drawback of reduced 
versatility. Although not shown, another prior art sewing machine 
has been proposed in which a cylinder unit is formed into 
a cylindrical shape so that the distance between the left 
end of the cylindrical cylinder unit and a throat plate 
is reduced as much as possible. The sewing machine cannot 
be used for a tubular sewing product which must be sewn 
while being fitted deeply onto a cylinder unit, thereby  
 
arising a problem of applicability. Also in a cylinder-bed 
type sewing machine in which a cylindrical cylinder 
unit has a small peripheral length so as to cope with a 
tubular sewing product of a small peripheral length, when

In a cylinder-bed type sewing machine comprising: 
   a cylindrical cylinder unit; 

   a throat plate disposed at a position which is on an 
upper face of said cylinder unit and confronts a needle; 

   a feed dog, disposed in a hole which is formed in 

said throat plate, for rearward feeding a sewing product 
along an outer periphery of said cylinder unit; and 

   a needle guard which can be reciprocally and 
lengthwise moved so as to make contact with said needle 

under a state in which said needle passes through said 
throat plate, 

   said sewing machine further comprises: 
   an arcuate feeding active portion formed in said 

feed dog and having a curvature which is the same as that 
of said cylinder unit; 

   a feed base to which said feed dog is fixedly 
connected; 

   a U-like feed base support, rotated about a shaft 
which is concentrical with the center of said cylindrical 

cylinder unit, for slidably and respectively holding said 
feed base support, and for rotating said feed dog about 

said shaft; 
   a feed lifting rock shaft which is driven by a crank 

 
shaft rotating in one direction, and which is disposed in 

said cylindrical cylinder unit; 
   a slide block, formed on a front end portion of said 

feed lifting rock shaft and fitted into a notched portion 
formed in said feed base, for vertically reciprocating 

said feed base so that said feeding active portion is 
vertically moved between a position where said feeding 

active portion of said feed dog is projected from said 
hole of said throat plate toward the outer peripheral 

portion of said cylinder unit, and another position where 
said feeding active portion is retracted from said hole 

into said cylinder unit; 
   a feed lengthwise shaft which is disposed in said 

cylindrical cylinder unit, which is moved by said crank 
shaft, and which is parallel to said feed lifting rock 

shaft; and 
   a connecting link, connecting a front end portion of 

said feed lengthwise shaft with said feed base, for 
lengthwise reciprocating said feed base so that said 

feeding active portion of said feed dog is reciprocally 
moved while forming a feeding locus in which said feeding 

active portion is moved arcuately and rearward, and also
