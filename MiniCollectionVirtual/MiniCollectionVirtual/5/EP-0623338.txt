<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are transparent, clear cosmetic stick 
compositions of the type gelled with soaps such as sodium salts 

of saturated fatty acids, and containing an alcohol (e.g., 
propylene glycol) and water. The compositions include sodium 

salts of methyl carboxy derivatives of ethoxylated lauryl 
alcohol (e.g., sodium laureth-13 carboxylate) to improve 

transparency and clarity of the stick compositions. The soap 
gelling agent can be a mixture of sodium salts of fatty acids 

(e.g., saturated fatty acids) of carbon chain length C

. 
The stick compositions can include deodorant active materials 

(such as fragrances, bacteriostats, bacteriocides, etc.) so as 
to provide transparent, clear deodorant stick compositions for 

application to axillary regions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cosmetic stick 
compositions, i.e., cosmetic solid stick compositions such as 
deodorant solid stick compositions. More specifically, the 
present invention relates to cosmetic solid stick compositions 
containing an alcohol (for example, a monohydric alcohol, such 
as ethanol, or a polyhydric alcohol, such as propylene glycol) 
and water, and gelled with a soap (for example, an alkali metal 
salt of a saturated fatty acid). In particular, the present 
invention relates to transparent, clear cosmetic (deodorant) 
solid stick compositions with improved clarity and 
transparency, so as to achieve an improved appearance, and 
which retain such improved clarity and transparency over an 
extended period of time. It has been desired to provide a soap-gelled, transparent, 
clear cosmetic stick composition, such as a soap-gelled, 
transparent, clear deodorant solid stick composition, which 
retains transparency and clarity over an extended period of 
tine so as to have long shelf life. It has also been 
desired to provide such a transparent, clear cosmetic stick 
composition, having a long shelf life, which avoids crystals 
forming in the stick. U.S. Patent No. 4,759,924, the contents of which are 
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, discloses  
 
transparent, soap-gelled cosmetic stick compositions containing 
a polyhydric aliphatic alcohol having 2 to 6 carbon atoms; 
water; a soap gel-forming agent; and a hydro-alcoholic soluble 
emollient having the formula R(OC3H6)a(OC2H4)bOH, where R is 
either hydrogen or a hydrocarbon chain having from about 1 to 
18 carbon atoms, and a/(a+b)â‰¦0.5. This patent discloses that 
the polyhydric alcohol can illustratively be ethylene glycol or 
propylene glycol, and that mixtures of polyols can be used; and 
that illustratively the gel-forming agent can be the sodium, 
potassium and aluminum salts of fatty acids containing from 
about 14 to 18 carbon atoms. Preferred fatty acid soap gel-forming 
agents include sodium stearate, sodium palmitate, 
potassium stearate, potassium palmitate, sodium myristate and 
aluminum monostearate. Illustrative hydro-alcoholic soluble 
emollients include PPG-5-Ceteth 20, PPG-3-Myreth-3, PEG-20-Laurate, 
PEG-6-32 and Polyoxamer 335. U.S. Patent No. 4,759,924 further discloses that the stick 
composition can include various optional ingredients, including 
conventional deodorant materials; and that the stick 
composition (gel stick) can be used by the consumer by rubbing 
the stick on the area of
