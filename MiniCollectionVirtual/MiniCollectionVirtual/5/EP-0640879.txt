<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tonable, radiation-sensitive mixture and to a process for the production of multicolour images (prints) by means of a mixture of this type. In this process, which is particularly suitable for the production of colour proofs for multicolour printing, a radiation-sensitive recording material comprising a layer support (carrier, substrate), a tonable, radiation-sensitive layer of the radiation-sensitive mixture and a top layer are used, where the radiation-sensitive layer changes its tack properties on irradiation with actinic light. In this process, a) the radiation-sensitive recording material, after the cover film has been peeled off, is applied to an image support, b) the radiation-sensitive layer is exposed imagewise through the layer support, c) the layer support is peeled off, d) a toner material is applied to the tacky areas of the radiation-sensitive layer, and e) steps a) to d) are repeated, the recording material being applied to the layer which has previously been toned in each case, and a toner material of a different colour being used in each repetition. The addition of a polycaprolactone having a mean molecular weight of at least 50,000 to the radiation-sensitive mixture improves the adhesion properties of the radiation-sensitive layer.
