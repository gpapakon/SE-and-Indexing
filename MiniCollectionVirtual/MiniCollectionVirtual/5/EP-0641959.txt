transmission systems (10) is provided. In a preferred embodiment, the control 

system/method (FIG. 4) defines the window ((OS*GR

(112/114, 116/118) engagement will occur or tend to occur when the input shaft (16) is 
rotating at speed (IS) equal to or slightly greater than a true synchronous speed (OS*GR

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to EP-A-641 958, titled VARIABLE
SYNCHRONOUS WINDOW filed the same day, September 7, 1993, and assigned to the
same assignee, Eaton Corporation, as this application.The present invention relates to a control system/method for controlling the
engagement of positive jaw clutches in an at least partially automated vehicular mechanical
transmission system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a control
system/method for an automated vehicular mechanical transmission system which will cause
or bias the transmission jaw clutches to engage at a time when the engine/input shaft driven
clutch member is rotating at a speed slightly greater (preferably about 10 to 50 RPM greater)
rotational speed than the clutch member in driving relation with the output shaft.Fully or partially automated mechanical transmission systems for vehicles, such as
heavy duty tractor - semitrailer vehicles, are well known in the prior art as may be seen by
reference to U.S. Patent Nos. 4,361,060; 4,595,986; 4,614,126; 4,648,290; 4,676,115;
4,784,019; 4,874,881; 4,899,607; 5,050,427 and 5,136,897.
Briefly, these automated transmission systems typically
utilized sensors to provide information such as drive mode or shift selection, throttle pedal
position, currently engaged ratio and engine, input shaft and/or output shaft speeds to a 
controller. The controller, typically microprocessor based, would process these inputs
according to predetermined logic rules to issue command output signals to various actuators
such as an engine fueling device, a master clutch operator and/or a transmission shift
actuator. Engine fueling manipulation, an input shaft or engine brake and/or a power
synchronizer were typically used to cause the input shaft and its associated gearing to rotate
at a substantially synchronous rotational speed relative to the output shaft rotational speed
and target gear ratio.
EP-A-413412 discloses the nearest prior art.In view of the known response times for the various actuators, as the input shaft
speed ("IS") approached the synchronous window, i.e. the product of output shaft speed
times the numerical value of the target gear ratio (OS*GRTARGET) plus or minus an
acceptable value (usually about ± 40 RPM), the jaw clutches associated with the target gear
ratio were commanded to engage with the expectation that the expected input shaft speed
(ISE) would be within the acceptable range as the target ratio jaw clutch members came into
initial engagement.While the prior art vehicular
