<DESCRIPTION>
 ISOLATION AND CLONING OF A PROTEIN WITHTYROSINE-PHOSPHATASE ACTIVITYField of the Invention The present invention relates to transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase proteins, DNA coding therefor, methods for production and identification of these proteins, and methods for screening compounds capable of binding to and inhibiting or stimulating phosphatase enzymatic activity.Background of the InventionThe phosphorylation state of protein tyrosyl residues plays a key role in cellular growth control. Cellular phosphotyrosine levels are regulated by the relative activities of opposing protein-tyrosine kinases and tyrosine phosphatases. Several growth factor receptors, as well as insulin receptor, are tyrosine-specific protein kinases.The activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is mediated by interaction with their respective growth factors or cytokines, such as FGF, EGF, PDGF, GM-CSF and IL-1, and usually induces mitogenesis and growth (Yarden, Y. and Ullrich, A.: Annual Rev. Biochem. 52, 443-478; 1988). The association between tyrosine phosphorylation and cell proliferation was further supported by the finding that many ÏŒncogene products also act as tyrosine kinases and share extensive sequence homology with known polypeptide growth factor receptors. These observations suggest that protein tyrosine phosphatases, for their ability to selectively counteract the action of tyrosine kinases, may play an important role in the control of cell growth and activation. 

Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases can "reversibly transform" cells and it has been proposed that alterations in PTPase activity may be involved in neoplastic processes, leading to the concept that protein tyrosine phosphatases may act as tumor suppressors. (Klarlund, J.K. (1985) Cell 41, 707-717).Although much of the work on tyrosine kinases has focused on growth regulation, recent findings in the non- proliferating cells of the central nervous system demonstrate the presence of relatively large amounts of tyrosine kinase activity. For example, receptors for insulin are present in specific brain regions and are specifically autophosphorylated following ligand stimulation. It has recently been demonstrated that the distribution of the insulin receptor in rat brain is strictly correlated with the distribution of phosphotyrosines, suggesting that this kinase is active in vivo and participates to the functions of adult central nervous system (Moss, A.M., Unger, J.W., Moxley, R.T. and Livingston, J. Proc. Natl. Acad.
