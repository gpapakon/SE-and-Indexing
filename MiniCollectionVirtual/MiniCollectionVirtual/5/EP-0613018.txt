<ABSTRACT>
The device for monitoring insulation includes current sensors which can give rise to measurement errors. These errors due to reactive and resistive components of the sensors are evaluated by connecting a generator of reference current Iref up to the measurement resistor (Rm) during a calibration cycle. The difference in the voltages measured at the terminals of the measurement resistor (Rm) during and outside the calibration cycle makes it possible to determine correction parameters. The voltages measured at the terminals of the measurement resistor are filtered by a filter (14) and separated into real (vr) and imaginary (vi) parts by a synchronous detector (15). A processing circuit (16) monitors the connection of the current generator, calculates and stores the correction parameters and corrects the measurements.
