<ABSTRACT>
Railway drives which are fed from an AC voltage network (1) or from a DC voltage network (2) at different voltages convert these feed voltages by means of two-quadrant converters (St1 - St4), which are operated as parallel-connected four-quadrant converters for an AC feed and as step-up or step-down converters for a DC feed, into an intermediate-circuit DC voltage (UD) which is as constant as possible. In order to reduce harmonics in the case of a DC feed, the two-quadrant converters (St1 - St4) can be connected via in each case one inductive impedance (L1 - L4) and switches (S8 - S11) to a positive pole (P) of a DC voltage intermediate circuit (11). The 2-quadrant converters (St1 - St4) are pulsed in a phase-shifted manner such that an 1-th two-quadrant converter is triggered or switched on (1/l) of a clock duration later than an (l - 1)th 2-quadrant converter. A ratio of the switched-duration or conducting duration to the pulse duration, that is to say a duty ratio  beta  of each of the l 2-quadrant converters is controlled to a value of  beta  = m/l, n = a number of converters

Method for the conversion of DC voltages from a 
1st DC voltage (UF) to a 
2nd DC voltage (UD), 

a) the 1st DC voltage (UF) being supported in 
voltage terms by a capacitor (CF), 
b) n converters (St1 - St4, St1' - Stn', St1" - 
Stn") being connected in parallel to the 

1st DC voltage side on the capacitor side and 
being operatively connected to the 1st DC 

voltage (UF) 
c) and being operatively connected on the 2nd DC 
voltage side, via at least one smoothing 

inductor or one inductive resistor (L1 - Ln) 
in each case, to a 2nd DC voltage (UD), 
d) converters (St1 - St4, St1' - Stn', St1" - 
Stn") which are in operation being pulsed in 

a phase-shifted manner, 
 
characterized 


e) in that, in order to reduce harmonics, 1 of n 
converters (St1 - St4, St1'- Stn', St1" - 

Stn'') are regularly pulsed in a mutually 
phased-shifted manner such that the phase 

shift between two of the 1 successively pulsed 
converters (St1 - St4, St1' - Stn', St1" - 

Stn") amounts to the 1th part of one clock 
period (T), and 
f) in that a ratio of the switched-on duration or 
conducting period (T1) to the clock period 

(T), that is to say a duty ratio (β) of each 
of the 1 converters, is set to one of the 

possible values of β = m/l, where 2 ≤ l ≤ n, 
l ≤ m ≤ 1; l, m being integers. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized 

a) in that, of all the possible values of the 
duty ratio (β), that value is selected for 

operation of the 1 converters (St1 - St4, St1' 
- Stn', St1" - Stn") which comes closest to 

a voltage ratio of x/y or, in the event of a  
 

plurality of identical values, is one of them, 
x being that of the two 1st or 2nd DC voltages 

(UF, UD) whose amplitude is less than or equal 
to that of the respective other DC voltage y,

voltage values (UFS, UDS) which is less than 

or equal to the other required DC voltage 
value y.

a) in that a 1st required DC voltage value UFS of 
the 1st DC voltage (UF) is less than or equal

2nd DC voltage (UD) and 
b) in that the duty ratio β of the 1 converters 
(St1 - St4, St1'- Stn', St1" - Stn") is set 

to a value such that the magnitude of the 
difference between the ratio of the 1st 

required DC voltage value (UFS) to the 2nd 
required DC voltage value (UDS) and the duty 

ratio (β) is a minimum, that is to say such 
that |UFS/UDS -β| = min. 
Method according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised 

a) in that the 1st DC voltage UF is less than or 
equal to a 2nd required DC voltage value UDS

b) in that the duty ratio β of the 1 converters 
(St1 - St4, St1' - Stn', St1" - Stn") is 

regulated as a function of the 1st DC voltage 
(UF), and 
c) is set to a value such that the magnitude of 
the difference between the ratio of the 1st DC 

voltage (UF) to the 2nd required DC voltage 
value (UDS) and the duty ratio (β) is a minimum, 

that is to say such that |UF/UDS - β| = 
min.

the difference between the ratio of the 1st 

required DC voltage value (UFS) to the 2nd DC 
voltage (UD) and the duty ratio (β) is a 

minimum, that is to say such (UFS/UD - β| = 
min. 
Method according to Claim 4 or 5, characterised 
in that, in the event of a change in the duty ratio (β), 

its deviations from one of the permissible values are 
limited in time in such a manner that signal frequency 

limits which can be predetermined are not exceeded.
