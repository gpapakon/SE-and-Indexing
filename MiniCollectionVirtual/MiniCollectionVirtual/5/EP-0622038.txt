<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a multi-purpose carriage and in particular 
to one including an upper frame (10) provided with two upper (11,12) 

supports each having a toothed member at the lower end, two transverse 
rods (13,14) mounted between the two upper supports (11,12), each of the 

upper supports having a fixing block, a slider and a guiding rack and 
being provided with a telescopic rod (15,16), each slider having a 

positioning device for mounting on the guiding rack, a head rest rod 
(18) pivotally connected with upper end of the upper supports and having 

an adjustable rest (185), a lower frame (20) provided with two lower 
supports (21,22) each having at the upper end a toothed member engaged 

with the toothed member of the upper frame (10), and a compound rack 
(30) engaged with the lower supports (21,22) of the lower frame and 

composed of two telescopic rods each connected with a L-shaped rod, the 
L-shaped rod being provided with a plurality of wheel assemblies (40),

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved multi-purpose 
carriage. It is found that the prior art carriage on the market 
has only one usage and so there is a need for a carriage 
with multi-functions. However, the multi-purpose 
carriages on the market are unsatisfactory in use and have 
to be improved. A multi-purpose carriage is known from US-A-4'369'987. The carriage 
is used simultaneously as a foldable wheeled chair and luggage carrier, 
but is not transformable from one single purpose use to another.  
 Therefore, it is an object of the present invention 
to provide a carriage which may obviate and mitigate the 
above-mentioned drawbacks. This invention relates to an improved multi-purpose 
carriage. It is the primary object of the present invention to 
provide a multi-purpose carriage which may be used as a 
seat, a chair, a bed or a baby carriage as desired. It is another object of the present invention to 
proivde a multi-purpose carriage which is easy to carry. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a multi-purpose carriage which is small in  
 
size. It is still another object of the present invention 
to provide a multi-purpose carriage which is simple in 
construction. It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a multi-purpose carriage which is economic to 
produce. The solution to the objects of the invention is provided by a multi-purpose 
carriage having the technical features defined in claim 1. Claims 2 and 3 
define modification of the carriage according to claim 1.  
 Other objects and merits and a fuller understanding 
of the present invention will be obtained by those having 
ordinary skill in the art when the following detailed 
description to the preferred embodiment is read in 
conjunction with the accompanying drawings. 
FIG. 1 is an exploded view of the present invention; FIG. 2 shows the way to fix the slider in position; FIG. 3 shows the structure of the fixing device; FIG. 4 shows the collapsed state of the headrest rod; FIG. 5 shows the engagement between the lug and the 
telescopic rod; FIG. 6 shows the structure of the adjustable rest; FIGS. 7, 7A and 7B show the way to use the present  
 
invention as a seat; FIG. 8 shows the engagement between the back cushion 
and the pawls 61; FIG. 9 shows the way to use the present invention as

<CLAIMS>
A multi-purpose carriage comprising:
 
   an upper frame (10) provided with two upper supports (11,12) 

each having a toothed member (111,112) at the lower end, 
two transverse rods (13,14) mounted between said two 

upper supports (11,12), each of said upper supports (11,12) 
having a fixing block (113,124), a slider (114,127) and a guiding 

rack (115,128) and being provided with a telescopic rod (15,16), 
each said slider (114,127) having a positioning device 

for mounting on said guiding rack (115,128), a head rest 
rod (18) pivotally connected with upper end of said 

upper supports (11,12) and having an adjustable rest (185);
 
   a lower frame (20) provided with two lower supports (21,22) 

each having at the upper end a toothed member (211,221) 
engaged with the toothed member (111,112) of said upper 

frame (10); and
 
   a compound frame engaged with the lower supports (21,22) of 

said lower frame (20) and composed of two telescopic (M,A,B) 
rods each connected with an L-shaped rod (L), said 

L-shaped rod (L) being provided with a plurality of  
 

wheel assemblies (40). 
The multi-purpose carriage as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the end of the telescopic rod and the L-shaped rod 

is provided with a C-shaped opening connected with the 
lower supports of said lower frame by engaging with a rod 

with elliptical cross section so that the telescopic rod 
and the L-shaped may be detached from and mounted on the 

lower supports of said lower frame simply by turning the 
rod. 
The multi-purpose carriage as claimed in Claim 1, 
further comprising a supporting frame for supporting said 

telescopic rods.
