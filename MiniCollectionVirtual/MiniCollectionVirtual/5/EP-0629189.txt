<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel processes for the preparation of intermediates in 
the synthesis of the quinoline antibiotic 7-(1α,5α,6α)-(6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-yl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic 
acid and related antibiotic compounds. The quinoline antibiotic 7-(1α,5α,6α)-(6-amino-3-azabicyclo[3.1.0]hex-3-yl)-1-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic 
acid has the chemical formula 
 
This compound and related azabicyclo quinoline carboxylic acids that exhibit 
antibacterial activity are referred to in United States Patent US-A 5 164 402 
and World Patent Application WO 91/02526, filed on August 16, 1989 
and published on March 7, 1991. The novel methods of this invention may be used to prepare compounds of the 
formula  
 
 
which are intermediates in the synthesis of the quinoline antibiotic of the formula I and 
the azabicyclo quinoline carboxylic acid antibiotics referred to above. The methods by 
which compounds of the formula VII may be converted into such antibiotic compounds 
are set forth in detail in United States Patent US-A-5 164 402 and World Patent 
Application WO 91/02526. The present invention relates to a process for preparing a compound of the 
formula 
 
wherein R is (C1-C6) alkyl, (C3-C6)cycloalkyl or benzyl, wherein the phenyl moiety of said 
benzyl group may be substituted, optionally, with one or more substituents 
independently selected from halo (e.g., chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo), nitro, (C1-C6) 
alkyl, (C1-C6) alkoxy, amino and trifluoromethyl, comprising reacting a compound of the 
formula  
 
 
wherein R is defined as above, with a halonitromethane in the presence of a base. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the compound of formula III formed 
in the above process is a compound wherein R is (C1-C6)akyl or benzyl. In a more 
preferred embodiment, R is benzyl. The term "halo", as used herein, refers to chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo. This invention also relates to the process described above, further comprising 
reacting the compound of formula III so formed with a reducing agent to form a 
compound of the formula 
 
wherein R is defined as above. This invention also relates to compounds having the formula  
 
 
wherein R is defined as above. The processes of the present invention and the preparation of the compounds 
of the present invention are illustrated in the following reaction scheme. Except where 
otherwise indicated, in the reaction scheme and discussion
