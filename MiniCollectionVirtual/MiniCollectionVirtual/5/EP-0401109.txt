 in which:
 - X at position 4 represents a valine, leucine, isoleucine, norleucine, alanine, cyclohexylalanine, O-methylthreonine, phenylglycine, alpha-aminobutyric acid or arginine residue,

 - Y at position 5 represents an isoleucine or serine residue,
 - Z at position 7 represents a methionine or norleucine residue, on the understanding that Z represents a norleucine residue when X represents an arginine residue, to the preparation thereof and to the use of these new microproteins as a drug.
