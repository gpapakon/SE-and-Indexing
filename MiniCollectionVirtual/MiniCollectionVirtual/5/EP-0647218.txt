<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing organic compounds or polymers containing one or more sulphur atoms and having one or more double bonds in a hydrocarbon chain. An acyclic olefin or a cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbon, containing sulphur, is metathesized alone or with an acyclic olefin or a cyclic unsaturated hydrocarbon, containing no sulphur, to give novel olefins, novel dienes and/or olefin polymers containing one or more sulphur atoms.
