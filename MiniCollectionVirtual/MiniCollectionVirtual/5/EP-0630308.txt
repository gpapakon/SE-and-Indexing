<ABSTRACT>
A device for internally cladding an outer tube with an inner tube by means of an explosion process. The invention is characterized in that the device includes an outer tubular fixture (1) in whicch a workpiece comprising the outer (2) and the inner (3) tubes can be placed; in that at least one of the tubular fixture (1) is connected to an expansion chamber (7, 10); and in that a sealing cap (6) of easily destructed material is located between a respective expansion chamber (7, 10) and the workpiece. The sealing cap or caps (6) is/are intended to retain a liquid pressure-transmitting medium (5), preferably water, in the inner tube (3) prior to detonating an explosive substance (4) placed within the inner tube (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for cladding 
an outer tube with an inner tube made, for instance, 
of corrosion-resistant material, in which the inner 
tube is bonded to the outer tube by means of an 
explosion process. It is known to clad tubes, for instance steel tubes, 
for transporting oil and gas or other chemical 
products, with a thin internal tube made of corrosion-resistant 
material, by means of an explosion process. Hitherto, it has been necessary to carry out such tube 
cladding processes in separate firing places, mostly 
outdoors, due to noise and gases. This results in 
relatively high transportation and handling costs. 
Moreover, cladding processes are dependent on weather 
and wind conditions. The present invention relates to a device which 
enables tubes to be clad by explosion processes in a 
practically noiseless fashion and in a workshop 
locality. The present invention thus relates to a device for 
cladding an outer tube with an inner tube by means of 
an explosion process, the 
device including an outer tubular fixture in which a 
workpiece comprising said outer and said inner tube is 
intended to be placed; wherein at least one end of the 
tubular fixture is connected to an expansion chamber; and wherein 
a sealing cap of easily destroyed material is 
located between the expansion chamber and the 
workpiece, said sealing cap or caps being intended to 
retain a liquid pressure transmitter, preferably 
water, in the inner tube prior to detonation of an 
explosive substance placed within the inner tube.  
 The invention will now be described in more detail 
with reference to exemplifying embodiments thereof 
shown in the accompanying drawings, in which 
Figure 1 is a schematic axial sectional view of the 
inventive device; Figure 2 illustrates one end of the device in 
larger scale; and Figure 3 illustrates one end of an alternative embodiment 
of the device. Figure 1 illustrates schematically a device 
constructed in accordance with the invention. The 
device includes an outer tubular fixture in which a 
workpiece 2, 3 comprising an outer tube 2 and an inner 
tube 3 is inserted. The workpiece also includes one or 
more explosive charges 4, placed within the inner tube 
3. At least one end of the tubular fixture is 
connected to an expansion chamber 7, 10. The device 
also includes sealing caps 6 which are made of an 
easily destroyed material and which are intended to be 
fitted onto both ends of the workpiece and function to 
retain a liquid pressure-transmitting medium
