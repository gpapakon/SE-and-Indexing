<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst, suitable 
for purifying exhaust gas, that is used in removing 
nitrogen oxides in exhaust gases, particularly those from 
internal combustion engines such as used by automobiles, 
and a method of removing NOx by using said catalyst. In view of the prevention of global warming, in 
recent years internal combustion engines of a lean burn 
system that can suppress the emission of carbon dioxide, 
for example, lean burn gasoline engines and diesel engines, 
have attracted notice. The exhaust gas from this type of 
internal combustion engine contains reducing components, 
such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and 
hydrogen (H₂), as well as oxidizing components, such as 
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and oxygen (O₂), and is characterized 
by an excess of oxygen and the presence of steam as a 
product of the combustion. Conventionally, there are many reports that, as a 
catalyst of purifying this type of exhaust gas, a catalyst 
consisting of, for example, alumina or a transition metal 
on alumina is effective for the NOx reduction reaction that 
uses hydrocarbons as a reducing agent. Examples of 
Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 4-90826 
report use of powdered alumina for FCC as a NOx 
 
reduction catalyst. Also Japanese Pre-examination Patent 
Publication (KOKAI) No. 4-284848 reports examples wherein 
use is made of, as a NOx reduction catalyst, alumina or 
alumina/silica containing 0.1 to 4 % by weight of Cu, Fe, 
Cr, Zr, Ni, or V. Further, for example, Japanese Preexamination 
Patent Publication (KOKAI) Nos. 4-267946, 5-68855, 
and 5-103949 report that where a catalyst carrying 
Pt on alumina is used, the NOx reduction reaction proceeds 
in a low temperature range of about 200 to 300°C. 
However, where these catalysts having supported noble 
metals are used, the combustion reaction of hydrocarbons 
that are a reducing agent is facilitated and therefore the 
selectivity of the NOx reduction reaction is poor, which is 
a defect. Some of the inventors of the present application 
found previously that where a catalyst containing silver is 
used in an atmosphere having excess oxygen with hydrocarbon 
used as a reducing agent, the NOx reduction reaction 
proceeds selectively, which was disclosed in Japanese Preexamination 
Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 4-281844. 
After this disclosure, similar NOx reduction techniques 
that used a catalyst containing silver were disclosed in 
Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication (KOKAI) Nos. 4-354536,
