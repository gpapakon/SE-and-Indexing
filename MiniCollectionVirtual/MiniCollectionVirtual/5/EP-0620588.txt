<ABSTRACT>
A mask (4) defining at least one window (4a) is provided on 
one major surface (1a) of a semiconductor body (1). The 

semiconductor body (1) is etched to define a groove (5) into a 
first region (2) of one conductivity type through a second region 

(3) of the opposite conductivity type. A relatively thin layer of 
gate insulator (6) is provided on the surface (5a) of the groove 

(5). A gate conductive region (7) of an oxidisable conductive 
material is provided within the groove (5) to define with the gate 

insulator layer an insulated gate structure (8) bounded by a 
conduction channel-defining area (30) of the second region (3). A 

step (15) in the surface structure is then defined by causing the 
insulated gate structure (8) to extend beyond the surrounding 

surface by oxidising the exposed (7a) gate conductive material to 
define an insulating capping region (9) on the gate conductive 

region (3). A layer (10) is formed over the surface structure and 
etched anisotropically to leave portions (10a) of the layer on the 

side wall (8'a) of the step (15) defined by the insulated gate 
structure (8) and to define beneath the portions (10a) third 

regions (11) of the one conductivity type within the second region 
(3). An electrically conductive layer (12) is deposited to contact 

both the second and the third regions (3 and 11).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device comprising an insulated gate field effect device, in particular an insulated gate field effect device in which the insulated gate is formed within a groove or recess.US-A-4967245 describes device manufacturing method as set out in the preamble of claim 1. The device is a so-called trench power MOSFET which is an insulated gate field effect transistor formed of very many, typically hundreds of thousands, of parallel-connected insulated gate field effect device cells (generally referred to as source cells) sharing a common drain region. In the method described in US-A-4967245 a semiconductor body is provided which has a first layer of one conductivity type, n conductivity type in the case of an n channel device, which in the case of a power MOSFET will form the drain drift region. The first layer is separated from a first major surface of the semiconductor body by a second layer of the opposite conductivity type which is itself separated from the first major surface by a third layer of the one conductivity type. A mask is provided on the first major surface to define at least one window through which the semiconductor body is then etched to define a groove extending through the second layer into the first layer so that the groove is bounded by surface areas of the second layer. A relatively thin gate insulating layer is then provided on the surface of the groove and doped polycrystalline silicon is deposited and then etched back to expose the groove mask and define a gate conductive region within the groove.The mask used to define the groove is formed of a material which resists oxidation, as described in US-A-4967245 silicon nitride. After the etching back of the polycrystalline silicon to form the gate conductive region, the exposed surface areas of the polycrystalline silicon are oxidised to define a protective insulating capping region over the gate conductive region. As is well known in the semiconductor art such a local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) technique results in so-called oxide bird's beaks at the edges of the anti-oxidation mask, that is areas where the oxidation proceeds slightly under the edges of the anti-oxidation mask. The capping region and adjoining bird's beaks regions are then used as a mask to etch through the third layer to expose the second layer leaving third layer regions of the one conductivity type beneath the bird's beak region. These third layer regions will form the source regions of a power MOSFET
