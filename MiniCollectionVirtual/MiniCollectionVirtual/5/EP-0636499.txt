<ABSTRACT>
A sorting apparatus is provided for sorting and stapling
sheets discharged from an image forming apparatus. A

plurality of vertically driven sheet bins (23, 73) are
provided along with a stapler (25) for stapling the sheets

while stored in the bins (23, 73). A pair of lateral guides
(261, 262) move stacks of sheets in the sheet width

direction within the bins. The lateral guides are adapted
to abut on either side of the sheets and to position the

sheets from an original position into a stapling position
in front of the stapler (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sorter, and more 
specifically, it relates to a sorter which incorporates a stapler 
capable of stapling a stack of sheets. A conventional copying machine may have a sorter for 
stacking the sheets from its image-developing process in a given 
order. One type of sorter includes a stapler for stapling each 
stack of sheets. Japanese Patent Publication JP-A-231757/1989 discloses one of 
the conventional sorters which has a stapler. The sorter has a 
plurality of bins for receiving sheets so as to sort them into a 
given order. The bins are disposed vertically and capable of 
moving vertically. A discharger is provided near the lowest end 
of the bins for the transport of sheets from the copying machine 
into the bins. A stapler for stapling the stacks of sheets 
stored in each bin is provided in the discharger. In the conventional sorter, there is a predetermined gap 
between respective adjacent bins through which sheets are 
transported from the discharger into the bins. The stack of 
sheets stored in each bin is stapled by the stapler. The stapler 
can be rotated through a predetermined angle such that the 
stapler is located either in a drawn position, allowing the bins  
 
to pass, or in the stapling position, in which the stapling 
operation is performed. Japanese Patent Publication JP-A-23154/1990 discloses another 
sorter which has a plurality of bins each of which is immovable. 
Sheets from a copying machine are transported by a transport 
mechanism which includes claws provided to correspond to the 
bins. In the sorter is a stapler which is vertically movable. The stapling operation of the sorter is performed as 
follows: the stapler is moved vertically; a pincher draws the 
stack of sheets in a bin into a stapling position; the stapler 
staples the stack of sheets; and the pincher moves the stack back 
into the bin. In the sorter disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication JP-A-231757/1989, 
the stapler is disposed in the discharger, wherein 
the stapler is an obstruction to bins moving vertically. 
Consequently, a mechanism to rotate the stapler between the 
stapling position and the drawn position must be provided, 
complicating the structure. In the sorter disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication JP-A-23154/1990, a device for drawing a stack 
of sheets out from a bin and moving the stack back into the bin 
must be provided in addition to the stapler, thus also 
complicating the structure of the sorter. The above-described sorters, however, cannot accommodate

<CLAIMS>
A sorting apparatus for sorting and stapling sheets 
discharged from an image forming apparatus (5), comprising: 


a plurality of sheet storages (23, 73, 114) vertically 
conveyable for storing sheets supplied from the image 

forming apparatus (5); 
means (24) for driving the sheet storages (23, 73, 
114); 
a stapler (25, 74, 116) for stapling the sheets while 
stored in the sheet storages (23, 73, 114); 
a pair of lateral guides (261, 262, 93) movable in the 
sheet width direction in the sheet storages (23, 73, 

114) and adapted to abut on either side of the sheets 
for positioning the sheets in the width direction by 

moving the stacks of sheets from an original position 
into the stapling position in front of the stapler 

(25, 74, 116) and back; and 
means for driving the lateral guides (261, 262, 93). 
The apparatus according to claim 1, wherein the stapler 
(25, 74, 116) is located in a position to one side 

of the trailing edges of the sheets, adjacent to one 
of the lateral guides (261, 262, 93) such that it is 

not an obstacle to the vertical movement of the sheet 
storages (23, 73, 114). 
The apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, wherein each 
of the sheet storages (23, 73, 114) includes a main 

tray (35), and a slidable tray (36) provided at an end 
of the main tray (35) adjacent to the trailing edges 

of the sheets and slidable in the sheet width direction. 
The apparatus according to claim 3, further comprising 
means (38) for urging the slidable tray (36) away from
