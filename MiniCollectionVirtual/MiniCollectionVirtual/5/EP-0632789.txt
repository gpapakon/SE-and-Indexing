<ABSTRACT>
A hydraulic crane with increased maximum lifting power in the high-position range, i.e. when the first boom section of the crane is located above the horizontal plane, comprises a position-detecting means (8) for detecting the position of the first boom section (2), and a load-sensing means (25) for sensing the load on the crane. Further, the crane has a relief valve (21) which is arranged on the lifting side of a piston and cylinder unit (5) for operating the first boom section (2) and which opens when the load on the crane exceeds a predetermined value. When the position-detecting means (8) detects that the crane is located within the high-position range and the load on the crane sensed by the load-sensing means (25) exceeds a predetermined value, the function of the relief valve is disconnected, e.g. by means of a valve (24). This makes it possible to guarantee the load carrying performance in the high-position range and permit an increased load resulting in an increased maximum lifting power. To avoid overload of the crane when the relief valve is disconnected, the maximum permissible speed for operating the first boom section is reduced, so that the dynamic forces become insignificant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
increasing the maximum lifting power of a hydraulic crane
in the high-position range, i.e. when the first boom section
is located above the horizontal plane, the position
of the first boom section being detected and the load
being sensed. The invention also concerns a hydraulic
crane with increased maximum lifting power in the high-position
range.As is well-known, hydraulic cranes have lower maximum
lifting power in the high-position range than in
other working range positions. When the first boom section
is erected from a position in the horizontal plane
towards a completely upright position, the leverage is
in fact shortened between, on the one hand, the point of
articulation between the crane body and the first boom
section and, on the other hand, the fixing point in the
first boom section for the piston rod of the piston and
cylinder unit operating the first boom section. This
reduces the moment of force that the piston and cylinder
unit is able to produce at a given pressure in the cylinder,
which in turn reduces the maximum lifting power of
the crane.A prior-art device for obviating the inconvenience
of a shortened leverage consists of a link mechanism. This
mechanism has a first link which is mounted between, on
the one hand, the point of articulation between the crane
body and the first boom section and, on the other hand,
the end of the piston rod in the lifting cylinder, as well
as a second link mounted between the end of the piston rod
and the first boom section. When the first boom section is
erected, the angle between the first and the second link
is maintained, such that the leverage is shortened to a
lesser extent than would have been the case without a link 
mechanism. Consequently, the maximum lifting power of the
crane is also reduced to a lesser extent.However, the link mechanism suffers from the disadvantage
of adding to the weight of the crane, which is
contrary to the general aim in the art of providing cranes
which are as light as possible in relation to their lifting
power so as to impart maximum net loading capacity to
e.g. a crane-equipped vehicle.Another disadvantage of the link mechanism is that it
involves the risk of fall through when the length of the
leverage changes rapidly, i.e. a risk that the pressure-limiting
valve of the hydraulic system opens and the load
falls to the ground.EP 0,349,359, on which the preambles of the independent Claims are based, discloses a safety device for restricting
the moment of force acting on

 by a relief valve (21) whose function
is adapted to be disconnected when the position-detecting

means (8) detects that the first boom section (2) is within
the high-position range and the load on the crane

sensed by the load-sensing means (25) exceeds a first
predetermined value, and means for limiting the maximum
