<ABSTRACT>
A chemical analysis element cartridge includes a 
box-like cartridge body in which a plurality of chemical 

analysis elements are stacked and are taken out through 
an element take-out port formed at one end of the 

cartridge body. A pressing member is slidably received 
in the cartridge body and is brought into contact with 

the stack of the elements on the side remote from the 
element take-out port to push the stack of the elements 

toward the element take-out port. The cartridge body is 
provided at least in one side wall thereof with a slit 

which extends in the direction of stack of the elements 
and the pressing member is provided with an external 

force receiving portion which is laterally interlocked 
with an urging member disposed outside the cartridge body 

through the slit and receives a force for urging the 
pressing member toward the element take-out port from the 

urging member. The pressing member is interlocked with 
an engagement member so that the pressing member and the 

engagement member are moved toward the element take-out 
port together with each other when the force from t
he 
urging member is acting on the pressing member and the 

engagement member permits the pressing member to be 
displaced away from the element take-out port relative to 

the engagement member when the force from the urging 
member is released.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chemical analysis
element cartridge for storing a plurality of chemical
analysis elements, such as those for quantitatively
analyzing the content of a specific chemical, biochemical
or immunochemical component contained in a sample liquid
such as blood or urine and for measuring the
concentration (activity) of particular ionic substances
in a sample liquid such as blood or urine, and taking out
the same one by one.According to the prior art there have been put into
practice various "dry-to-the-touch" chemical analysis elements.For example, there has been proposed, for instance, in
US-A-3 992 158; US-A-4 292 272 and US-A-5 019 347 and in
EP 0 162 302 B,
and put into practice a "dry-to-the-touch" chemical
analysis film with which the content of a specific
chemical, biochemical or immunochemical component
contained in a sample liquid (hereinafter referred to as
an analyte), the activity thereof or the content of a
solid component can be quantitatively analyzed by only
spotting a droplet of the sample liquid on the film. As
such a dry chemical analysis film, there has been known
an integrated multi-layered chemical analysis film
(sometimes referred to as "multi-layered chemical 
analysis element") comprising a support sheet of organic
polymer and at least one reagent layer which contains a
reagent and is formed on the support sheet. A spreading
layer is preferably provided over the reagent layer.
Further a dry chemical analysis element which is formed
of filter paper and has one or more layers has been
proposed, for instance, in US-A-4 477 575,
   and partly put into practice.When quantitatively analyzing the chemical,
biochemical or immunochemical components or the like
contained in a sample liquid using such a dry chemical
analysis film, a droplet of the sample liquid is spotted
on the film (on the spreading layer when the film is
provided with a spreading layer and directly on the
reagent layer when the film is not provided with a
spreading layer) and is held at a constant temperature
for a predetermined time (incubation) in an incubator so
that coloring reaction occurs, and the optical density of
the color formed by the coloring reaction is optically
measured. That is, measuring light containing a
wavelength which is pre-selected according to the
combination of the component to be analyzed and the
reagent contained in the reagent layer of the film is
projected onto the film and the optical density of the
film is measured. Then the concentration or the activity

A dry chemical analysis element cartridge (20) comprising

a box-like cartridge body (21) in which a plurality of
chemical analysis elements (1) are stacked and are taken out

through an element take-out port (22) formed at one end of the
cartridge body (21),
a pressing member (31) which is slidably received in the
cartridge body (21) and is adapted to be brought into contact

with the stack of the elements (1) on the side remote from the
element take-out port (22) to push the stack of the elements

(1) toward the element take-out port (22) under a force
applied thereto from an urging means (50) disposed outside the

cartridge body (21), and
an engagement member (33; 37) which is provided in the
cartridge body (21) to be movable toward the element take-out

port (22) and not to be movable away from the element take-out
port (22), wherein
the pressing member (31) and the engagement member (33; 37)
are interlocked with each other so that the pressing member

(31) and the engagement member (33; 37) are moved toward the
element take-out port (22) together with each other when the

force from the urging means (50) is acting on the pressing
member (31) and the engagement member (33; 37) permits the

pressing member (31) to be displaced away from the element
take-out (22) relative to the engagement member (33; 37) when
