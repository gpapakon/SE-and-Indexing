<ABSTRACT>
The transmission channels (DOC) are permanently assigned to all of the communications terminals (KE) in the downstream direction of communication. The packet-oriented information (pi) to be communicated is inserted into frame relay-oriented transmission packets (tp1..tpn) with a destination address (za1..n) and then broadcast to all of the communications terminals (KE) via the permanently assigned transmission channels (DOC). The broadcast transmission packets (tp1..tpn) are received by the communications terminals (KE) with the associated destination addresses (za1..zan) and forwarded.
