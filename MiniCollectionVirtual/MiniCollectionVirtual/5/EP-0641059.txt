<ABSTRACT>
A rotor (10) includes a plurality of permanent magnets (14) disposed substantially equidistantly round a shaft 
(12) and a plurality of laminated core members (16) each being disposed between the permanent magnets (14) and 

forming a magnetic pole. The laminated core members (16) are formed by laminating and bonding a large number 

of thin magnetic plate cores (26) and integral type thin cores. The integral type thin core (26) includes a plurality of 
thin core portions having the same shape and connecting portions (46) for connecting mutually the adjacent thin core 

portions. When a large number of thin cores (26) and integral type thin cores are integrally joined by a press work, 
each laminated core member (16) is mutually interconnected between the adjacent laminated core members (16) with 

a relative arrangement at the time of completion of assembly having installation spaces of the permanent magnets 
(14), and an integrated type laminate rotor core (48) is formed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotor for a
synchronous motor, which includes a plurality of
permanent magnets disposed around a shaft and magnetized
alternately in a circumferential direction, and a
plurality of laminated core members disposed around the
shaft while holding each permanent magnet therebetween in
the circumferential direction so as to form magnetic
poles.In the field of synchronous motors, a rotor as
mentioned above, which includes permanent magnets
magnetized in a circumferential direction and laminated
core members each forming a magnetic pole between the
permanent magnets, the magnets and the core members being
alternately disposed around a shaft, has been used. In
this type of conventional rotor, each laminated core
member is generally formed by stacking a plurality of
core-laminations made of magnetic materials such as
silicon steel plates. Each core-lamination may have
recesses and projections, which are formed at
corresponding positions on respective axial end faces of
core-lamination and can be engaged with each other. The
core-laminations can be joined to each other by, e.g.,
press-fitting the core-laminations together while
aligning the recesses and projections of the adjacent
core-laminations. Each permanent magnet is held between
a pair of adjacent laminated core members and brought
into close contact with the side faces of the latter.
The permanent magnet may be positioned and fixedly
supported in a radial direction by outer and inner hooks
protruding from the side faces of each laminated core
member at outer and inner peripheral regions thereof. A
rod member may be inserted into an axial through hole 
formed generally at the center of each laminated core
member. Each rod member may be connected to annular end
plates which are arranged at both axial ends of the
laminated core member and fixed to the rotating shaft.
In this manner, the laminated core members and the
permanent magnets are fixedly held in the rotor against
external force such as centrifugal force, by the end
plates, the rod members and the hooks.This type of rotor uses a plurality of permanent
magnets and laminated core members, the number of which
corresponds to the number of magnetic poles, therefore it
has problems in that the work of positioning or fixing
the permanent magnets and laminated core members is
complicated, increased working time and skilled workers
are required, and thus improvement of personnel
requirements and productivity is prevented. Further, the
accuracy of positioning the permanent
