<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cores for wire ropes, particularly
steel wire ropes.GB-A-2 219 014 describes a core for wire rope comprising a
fluted member of polymeric or elastomeric material having helical
grooves symmetrically spaced around its outer surface, each
groove in cross-section (in a plane normal to the longitudinal
axis of the core) having the form of an arc of a ellipse. The
properties and control of manufacture of the core may be
substantially improved by incorporating within the extrusion a
reinforcing member or cord constituted by a fibre core or
independent wire rope.However, the use of conventional types of reinforcing
members such as are illustrated in GB-A-2 219 014, has certain
drawbacks. Both fibre cores and independent wire rope cores, by
the very nature of their helical construction, entrap a quantity
of air which has a detrimental effect on the solidity of support
that the core is able to provide in the rope. This is especially
important in a wire rope, where the core is typically subjected
to very high radial pressures; any compressibility of the core
results in a reduction in rope diameter with tension and, hence,
an increased rope stretch characteristic, which is often
undesirable in service. Additionally, any pronounced reduction
in rope diameter will result in the outer strands of the rope
coming into contact with one another at the wire crowns, with
very high stresses at the contact points. In a rope which is
working backwards and forwards over sheaves or is otherwise 
repetitively flexed, these stresses will cause fretting damage to the outer wires, with a
consequent loss of fatigue performance.GB-A-2 219 014 discloses a core according to the preamble of claim 1, in which
the fluted member is tubular with a cylindrical internal region for containing a
reinforcing member. Practical experience with the conventional types of reinforcing
member disclosed in GB-A-2 219 014 has revealed that it is possible for the reinforcing
member to fail prematurely, before there has been any significant deterioration of the
outer strands of the rope (which are readily inspectable). This mode of failure is not
only undesirable from an inspection viewpoint, but can also lead to a loss of load
carrying capacity and structural integrity of the wire rope.What is desired is a core which avoids or mitigates these disadvantages.The present invention provides a core for wire rope, the core being made of
plastics material and comprising a tubular member of extruded plastics material having

<CLAIMS>
A core for wire rope, the core being made of plastics material and
comprising a tubular member (1) of extruded plastics material having a

cylindrical inner surface and having a fluted outer surface, formed by
extrusion, with symmetrically-arranged spaced-apart helical grooves (2) for

receiving respective wire strands (4) of the rope, characterised by a stiffer
solid cylindrical central member (3) of extruded plastics material, the inner

surface of the tubular member (1) being in intimate contact with the central
member (3), the diameter (d
3
) of the central member (3) being at least 70%
of the root diameter (d2) of the fluted outer surface, and the cross-sectional

area of the central member (3) being at least 40% of that of the core.
A core as claimed in claim 1, in which the tubular member (1) is
longitudinally slidable relative to the central member (3).
A core as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which the plastics material of the
central member (3) is harder than the plastics material of the tubular

member (1).
A core as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the plastics
material of the central member (3) contains discontinuous reinforcing fibres.
A core as claimed in any preceding claim, in which the plastics
material of the central member (3) and the plastics material of the tubular

member (1) are of the same type.
A core as claimed in any preceding claim, for a wire rope comprising
rounds strands (4), each having a circumscribing circle, in which each 

groove (2) - in a cross-section perpendicular to the groove - describes a
substantially circular arc.
A core as claimed in claim 6, which is of sufficient size to prevent
contact between the strands (4) in the rope when the radius of the said

circumscribing circle is equal to the radius of the said arc.
A method of manufacturing a core according to any preceding claim,
in which the tubular member (3) is formed by extrusion, characterised in

that the core is formed by two separate successive extrusion operations, the

first of which forms the central member (3), and the second of which forms
the tubular member (1) around the central member (3).
A wire rope comprising a core according to any of claims 1 to 7, and
wire strands (4) received in the respective grooves (2).
A wire rope as claimed in claim 9, in which the core prevents contact
between the strands (4).
A wire rope as claimed in claim 9 or 10, in which the strands (4) are
round strands, each having a circumscribing circle.
