<DESCRIPTION>
Diabetes refers to a disease process derived from multiple
causative factors and characterized by elevated levels of plasma glucose
or hyperglycemia. Uncontrolled hyperglycemia is associated with
increased and premature mortality due to an increased risk for
microvascular and macrovascular diseases, including nephropathy,
neuropathy, retinopathy, hypertension, stroke, and heart disease.
Therefore, control of glucose homeostasis is a critically important
approach for the treatment of diabetes.Type I diabetes (IDDM) is the result of an absolute
deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization.
Type II, noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is due to a
profound resistance to insulin stimulating or regulatory effect on
glucose and lipid metabolism in the main insulin-sensitive tissues,
muscle, liver and adipose tissue. This resistance to insulin
responsiveness results in insufficient insulin activation of glucose uptake,
oxidation and storage in muscle and inadequate insulin repression of
lipolysis in adipose tissue and of glucose production and secretion in
liver.The several treatments for NIDDM, which has not changed
substantially in many years, are all with limitations. While physical 
exercise and reductions in dietary intake of calories will dramatically
improve the diabetic condition, compliance with this treatment is very
poor because of well-entrenched sedentary lifestyles and excess food
consumption, especially high fat-containing food. Increasing the plasma
level of insulin by administration of sulfonylureas (e.g. tolbutamide,
glipizide) which stimulate the pancreatic β-cells to secrete more insulin
or by injection of insulin after the response to sulfonylureas fails, will
result in high enough insulin concentrations to stimulate the very
insulin-resistant tissues. However, dangerously low levels of plasma
glucose can result from these last two treatments and increasing insulin
resistance due to the even higher plasma insulin levels could
theoretically occur. The biguanides increase insulin sensitivity resulting
in some correction of hyperglycemia. However, the two biguanides,
phenformin and metfonnin, can induce lactic acidosis and
nausea/diarrhea, respectively.Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) are a recently disclosed
class of compounds that are suggested to ameliorate many symptoms of
NIDDM. These agents increase insulin sensitivity in muscle, liver and
adipose tissue in several animal models of NIDDM resulting in complete
correction of the elevated plasma levels of
