<ABSTRACT>
An optical fibre assembly 10 for blown 
installation, comprises a fibre unit 12 comprising at 

least one optical fibre 14. The unit has a coating 
comprising an external layer 18 of a material 

containing hollow glass beads 22 at least some of 
which project from the outer surface 24 of said 

external layer. The coating also has an inner, buffer 
layer 16 of a material having a lower modulus of 

elasticity than that of said material of the external 
layer and an intermediate layer 20 of material 

disposed between said external and inner layers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical fibre assemblies
for blown installation and more particularly to such
assemblies as disclosed in EP-A-0345968 and EP-A-0521710
(to which reference is directed) in which the
assembly comprises an optical fibre unit comprising at
least one coated optical fibre the coating of which fibre
comprises at least one coating layer, said assembly further
comprising a coating surrounding said unit and
comprising an external layer having an outer
surface and an inner surface and being of a material containing
particulate matter at least some of which matter projects
from the outer surface of said external layer and an inner
layer of a material having a lower modulus of elasticity
than that of the external layer.Like EP-A-0521710, this invention is particularly
concerned with such assemblies in which the optical
fibre unit comprises a plurality of coated optical fibres,
but nevertheless it is also applicable to such assemblies
in which the optical fibre unit comprises just
one coated optical fibre as in the illustrated embodiments
of EP-A-0345968 where the coating of the optical
fibre comprises two coatings - a soft primary buffer coating
and a hard secondary coating.In EP-A-0345968 the particulate matter is
mixed with the material of the external coating prior to
application of that coating but that leads to the presence
of the particulate matter at the interface between the external
layer and the inner layer which, it is concluded in
EP-A-0521710, is the probable cause of poor 'fibre
breakout' performance on bending particularly when the
system of EP-A-0345968 is applied to such optical fibre
assemblies in which the optical fibre unit comprises a
plurality of coated optical fibres and thus need to have
larger diameters than assemblies in which the fibre unit
comprises a single optical fibre.To overcome this problem of poor fibre breakout
performance, EP-A-0521710 adds the particulate
matter to the external layer after it has been applied and
such that the innermost part of the layer is substantially
free of the particulate matter.One object of the present invention is to avoid
the problems identified in EP-A-0521710 of poor fibre
breakout performance in the system disclosed in EP-A-0345968
due to the presence of the particulate matter
at the interface between the external layer and the inner
layer. To this end, the invention broadly provides an intermediate
layer between the external and inner layers
for arresting any cracks propagating from the inner surface
of the external layer
