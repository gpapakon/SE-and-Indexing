<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a window winder with 
a closed cable-type, kinematic chain (6), 

in which all the traditional items for guiding, 
driving or tensing the cable have been eliminated, as 

have the supports and parts which are welded or riveted 
together. 
The unit is secured to the vehicle door by tightening 
three nuts which have been previously arranged on the 

corresponding bolts or screws fastened to it, thus making 
the assembly operation extremely easy, being extended to 

its use in a double rail (1,1') by simply duplicating its kinematic 
chain and adding the synchronizing element (17-19) between 

both. 
There is a rail or quide element (1) along which a 
drive slide (2) moves. The rail is equipped with a set of 

end supports (3,4) and the drive slide (2) is connected to a steel 
cable (6) which travels through these supports, with the 

ends of the cable connected to a tensioner drum (5) mounted 
on the rail.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a cable type vehicle window
winder with kinematic chain and electrical or manual
drive.A window winding device is known, through reference
DE-A-3740579, which has a rail and a cable that makes a
drive slide move, which in turn moves the window pane in
the vehicle door, with end parts on which the cable is
guided to the drive unit for the said cable, and with
these end parts having some particular characteristics.
In this technique, the guide, drive and tensioning items
of the cable follow the traditional method of operation.The basic aim of the invention is to simplify the
techniques used up to now in mechanisms used for moving
the glass pane, in opening and closing operations, in
automobile vehicle doors, using a new functional concept.Such an aim is achieved by a cable type vehicle
window winder as defined in the appended claim 1.With this invention, the complexity of the Bowden
cable system is eliminated, with the absence of all the
traditional elements for guiding, driving and tensing
the cable, as well as the supports and the parts which
are welded or riveted together, which in practice will
mean a great ease of construction, able to be carried
out in a very simple fashion. The assembly operations
are also made easier.For a better understanding of the invention,
the corresponding sheets of explanatory drawings are
attached, in which the
following are shown: 
Figures 1 to 4 show a general arrangement of the
different practical solutions for the invention.Figure 5 represents another version of the 
invention, relating to a double rail window winder.Figures 6, 7 and 8 represent the incorporation
of a coil (volute) spring, arranged parallel to the
drum and coaxial with it, to compensate for the weight
of the glass.Figures 9 to 12 show the fastening of the drive
element to the glass.Figures 13 to 16 make it possible to appreciate
the different shapes of rails which can be used.Figure 17 is an illustration of the end of the
rail.Figure 18 shows the arrangement of the assembly
of the end supports on the rail.Figure 19 is a representation of one version of
the self-tensioning drum.Looking now at Figures 1 to 4, we can observe how
the window winder device is essentially provided with a
guide-rail (1), on which a drive element (2) moves, with
this drive element being connected to two ends of the
cable (6). The ends of the said cable (6) that leave
the drive element (2) are inserted into a drum (5) trough
a set of end supports (3,4), with the cable winding and
tensing operations
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Cable type vehicle window winder with simplified
kinematic chain and electrical or manual drive, comprising


a guide element (1) made up of a profile with
a cross section suitable for its use as regards its dimensions

and moment of inertia, the ends of the guide
element resting on two rail support elements (3,4), made

of plastic material, which are inserted into the guide
element (1) by displacement,
a sliding drive element (2) for a window glass
pane (21), and
a tensioning drum (5),

   characterized in that:

the guide element (1) is constructed or shaped
by die-casting or rollig a metallic strip of stainless

or pretreated material, with ends perforated in a symmetrical
manner in order to allow each end to receive a

screw-threaded bolt (7,8) for fixing said guide element
(1) to a vehicle door and to receive said rail support

element (3,4), and with intermediate holes suitable for
receiving a motorized speed reducer (9) and said tensioning

drum (5),
each rail support element (3,4) is inserted
into the guide element (1) and clip-fitted over the

square head of said screw-threaded bolt (7,8) which has
been previously inserted into the guide, said bolt becoming

thus firmly fixed in place, so as to prevent said
bolt from being moved axially or turning when a corresponding

nut used for securing the guide element (1) to
the vehicle door is attached to the screw-threaded bolt

(7,8) and tightened,
the rail support elements (3,4) have integrated
into them slide tracks (23) for two multicore steel 

cables (6) or suitable spaces to receive channel wheels
or pulley-wheels on which said cables (6) will move,

these rail support elements being obtaied by injection
moulding of thermoplastic material, as well as the channel

wheels or pulley-wheels if they are used,
the sliding drive element (2) is moved along
the guide element (1) by the alternating pull of said

two multicore steel cables (6), said cables being inserted
with their first ends into the drive element (2) by

connection onto two pressed lugs and inserted in the
same way and wound onto the tensioning drum (5) by their

other ends, thus forming a closed kinematic chain once
said cables (6) run on the slide tracks (23) or channel

wheels or pulley-wheels in the rail support elements
(3,4) and have been tensed, without the assistance of

any other guiding, driving or tensioning elements,
the tensioning drum (5) is reached by the two
cables (6) coming from the sliding drive element (2)

after having passed through the rail support elements
(3,4), closing the kinematic chain by insertion, winding

and tensing onto the said tensioning drum, which
is made up of two coaxial parts (25,26) clip-fitted to

each other and which fix their final relative position
by the locking of an internal circular toothed rack in

one (26) of said coaxial parts and internal engaging
tongues (30) in the other part (25), the tensioning

drum (5) being submitted to rotation and tension operations
by the drive system chosen, whether it be electrical

or manual,
the cable type vehicle window winder being
such that the tensioning of the cables (6) is carried

out by initially joining and winding one of said cables
(6) onto said one part (26) of the tensioning drum

which has a helicoidal thread with convenient pitch
until a certain position, with this part (26) being 

subsequently immobilized by locking by means of an assembly
tool (32) an external toothed rack (29) cut on its

external side perimeter, joining the second cable (6) to
the second coaxial part (25) of the tensioning drum, and

turning this second part (25) in a direction opposite to
the winding direction of said one part (26) by less than

one full rotation, submitting said cables to a pre-set
tension, the winder being ready for use after release of

said external toothed rack (29) of the one part (26) by
means of the assembly tool (32).

kinematic chain and electrical or manual drive, in accordance

with claim 1, characterized in that the guide element

with simplified kinematic chain and electrical or manual

drive, comprising two cable type vehicle window winders
