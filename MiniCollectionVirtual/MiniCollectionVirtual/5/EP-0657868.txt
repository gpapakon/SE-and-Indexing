<ABSTRACT>
The subject matter of the present invention is a method for emitting very-low frequency acoustic waves with high power, and corresponding transducers. The technical field of the invention is that of producing electro-acoustic transducers for emitting acoustic waves in immersion in a liquid. A transducer according to the invention includes one or more electro-acoustic motors (1) placed in one and the same plane, inside or at a peripheral ring of a flexible casing (5), to which they are secured by at least one of their ends using any assembly device (2), and to which they transmit their vibrations, which flexible casing is in contact with the said liquid (4) constituting the acoustic-wave emission surface, and has a shape such that the amplitude of these vibrations is amplified in a very low frequency range; the said casing (5) includes at least some opening (6) allowing the said liquid (4) to penetrate the entire internal cavity (7) defined by the said casing (5); a baffle (15) made of cellular material which withstands the immersion pressure occupies the majority of the volume of the cavity (7), the external surface of which is at a constant distance (14) from that of the casing (5) and is secured to the assembly device (2, 8) of the acoustic motors (1).

A method for emitting very low frequency acoustic waves in a liquid by means of a
transducer of a known type comprising one or more electro-acoustic motors located

according to the same intemal plane or as a peripheral ring of a flexible envelope to
which they are interdependent at least at one of their extremities by any assembling

device to which they transmit their vibrations so that the envelope which must be in
contact to said liquid constitutes the emitting surface of the acoustic waves in the

latter, and whose shape is such that the amplitude of the vibrations is amplified,
making them low frequencies, wherein :


the said liquid is allowed to enter the entire internal cavity delimited by this
envelope by an orifice communicating with the outside ;
A baffle is located in cavity made up of alveolar material withstanding the
immersion pressure, which fills the greater part of the cavity volume and whose

external surface is at a constant distance from that of envelope
said baffle is made interdependent to the assembling device of acoustic motors
said motors are requested to emit the said very low frequency and high power
acoustic waves.
A transducer comprising one or more electro-acoustic motors located on the same
plane, inside or as a peripheral ring of a flexible envelope to which they are

interdependent at least at one of their extremities by any assembling device and to
which they transmit their vibrations, the said flexible envelope being in contact with

said liquid making up the acoustic wave emitting surface, and with a shape allowing
the amplitude of these vibrations to be amplified in a range of very low frequencies,

characterized in that the chamber partly constituted by said envelope includes at
least one orifice allowing said liquid to enter the entire internal cavity delimited by

this chamber and a baffle made up of alveolar material resisting the immersion
pressure and filling the main part of cavity volume, whose external surface is at a

constant distance from that of the envelope and which is interdependent to the
assembling device of the acoustic motors .
A transducer according to claim characterized in that said distance separating
baffle surfaces and envelope filled with liquid is between 3 - 6 mm.
A transducer according to claim 2, wherein said alveolar material has an acoustic
impedance 0.7 times lower than the water impedance.
A transducer according to claim 4, wherein said alveolar material is a P.V.C.-based
(Vinyl polychloride) cellular plastic with closed porosities. 
A transducer according to claim 5, wherein the said baffle is connected to
assembling device of motors by elastic studs .
A transducer according to claim 6, wherein the elastic characteristics of the
material making up saids studs are such that its displacement radial speed in

compression is ten times lower than that of acoustic motors.
A transducer according to claim 7, and such that the shape and type of external
envelope are ellipsoid, comprising two convex disks located opposite one another,

and connected at their periphery by at least one ring-shaped piece characterized in
that both disks are supported and immobilized on their periphery, each one in a

groove of piece .
A transducer according to claim 8, wherein each one of grooves is composed of
elements arranged in two rings and constituting piece connected two by two, 
on both
sides of the plane in which the acoustic motors are located by any means of

adjustment in relative distance, each one of the said rings of piece comprising a
conical surface cooperating with a surface having the same shape, supported by

another continuous peripheral external ring in such a way that the bringing together
of the elements of piece elements by means reduces the groove length and ensure

the prestressing of disk.
A transducer according to claim 9, wherein the said electro-acoustic motors and
their associated countermasses are arranged inside the said external peripheral ring.
