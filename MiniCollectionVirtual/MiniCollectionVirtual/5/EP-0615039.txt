<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an air/waste gas chimney for a plurality of calorific appliances, in particular gas-calorific thermal units. The chimney (1) exhibits a waste-gas line (4) which comprises a plurality of plugged-together parts (7, 8, 11) consisting of a corrosion-resistant stainless steel. The waste-gas line (4) is arranged approximately concentrically or coaxially within the chimney (1), at a distance from the inner surfaces thereof, with the result that a fresh-air supply means (5) is formed. Expediently, a plurality of spacers (6) are distributed over the length of the waste-gas line (4). Due to the plug-in system, the air/waste-gas chimney is simple to construct and assemble and can, in particular, be successfully used for repairing old structures.
