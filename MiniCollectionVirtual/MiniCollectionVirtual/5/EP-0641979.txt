<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for controlling the flow rate of the heat-carrying medium (heating medium) of air-cooled cooling systems, having a dry part (1), consisting at least of a heat exchanger (1a), and a wet part (2) to which the heat-carrying medium leaving the dry part (1) is fed in a force-closed fashion. Arranged in parallel with the heat exchanger (1a) is an overflow line (13) which in the event of higher flow rates feeds a portion of the heat-carrying medium directly to the wet part (2) by bypassing the heat exchanger (1a). In order to guarantee a pressure loss which is independent of the flow rate despite the design of the dry part (1) for only a portion of the maximum flow rate of the heat-carrying medium, there is arranged in the overflow line (13) a flap valve (14) whose flap (14a), in the event of a feed pressure (upstream pressure) corresponding to the dynamic pressure loss of the associated heat exchanger (1a) being exceeded, opens automatically while preserving the feed pressure.

<CLAIMS>
Air-cooled cooling plant with a dry part (1)
consisting of at least one heat exchanger (1a) and with

a wet part (2), to which the heat transfer medium leaving
the dry part (1) is supplied gravitationally, there being

arranged parallel to the heat exchanger (1a) an overflow
conduit (13) which, in the case of relatively high

throughflow quantities, supplies part of the heat transfer
medium to the wet part (2) directly, bypassing the

heat exchanger (1a), characterized in that the overflow
conduit (13) has arranged in it a flap valve (14), the

flap (14a) of which opens automatically when an admission
pressure corresponding to the dynamic pressure loss of

the associated heat exchanger (1a) when the rated
throughput of the latter is reached is exceeded, the said

flap thereby maintaining the admission pressure, the
rated throughput of the heat exchanger (1a) corresponding

to a part quantity of the maximum heat transfer medium
throughput of the cooling plant.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the flap valve (14) is arranged approximately at the

same geodetic height as the highest point of the heat
exchanger (1a).
Apparatus according to Claim 1 or 2, with a
plurality of parallel-connected heat exchangers, characterized

in that a ventilating valve (15) is arranged at
the highest point of the return conduit formed by combining

the overflow conduit (13) and the outlet conduit (7)
of each heat exchanger (1a).
Apparatus according to at least one of Claims 1 
to 3, characterized in that the flap (14a) of the flap

valve (14) is designed as a weighted flap.
