<ABSTRACT>
The breaking-off is carried out by a force acting in the connecting rod plane. The rod with the parts not to be broken is firmly clamped in a holder, while the cap abuts a second holder. The separating force is expansively effective in the big end bearing. The two holders are moved together in the separating force direction. During breaking-off, the cap remains linked to the connecting rod parts not to be separated such that a motion of both parts of the big end bearing, necessary for braking-off, remains available. Thus, the two parts are held together up to the next processing step.
