<ABSTRACT>
A gene coding for flavonoid-3',5'-hydrogenase has been cloned by using a DNA probe prepared from a cDNA library derived 
from petunia petals by the SSP.PCR method using a gene sequence coding for the amino acid sequence of a hemebinding 

region of cytochrome P450 as a primer. Further, a transformed plant having bluer petals than usual has been obtained by introducing 
the cloned gene into a plant and expressing the same. The invention can provide a plant having a pigment pattern which the 

flower or fruit does not possess naturally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique to 
breed plants or plant cells using recombinant DNA 
technology. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a technique to breed novel plant cells or 
novel plants which show exogenous pigment patterns by 
transforming plant cells or plants with a recombinant DNA 
containing a DNA which encodes a polypeptide having 
flavonoid-3',5'-hydroxylase activity (hereinafter also 
referred to as the DNA encoding flavonoid-3',5'-hydroxylase). Crossing between varieties has been conventionally 
employed as a method for altering the color of flowers 
and fruits of plants. However, crossing is carried out 
between varieties of the same genus, and usually of the 
same species, and therefore, it is extremely difficult to 
give specific colors to certain plant species. For 
example, in spite of longtime efforts of breeders, no one 
has yet successfully bred a blue rose or a blue 
carnation. In recent years, recombinant DNA technology has 
enabled plant breeding between different species or 
genus, and it is expected to breed new plants having 
unprecedented pigment patterns which can not be obtained 
by the conventional breeding methods by crossing (Plant 
Molecular Biology, vol.13, p.287-294, 1989). For 
example, it is reported that petunia showing 
unprecedented brick-red color on flowers was bred by 
cloning a gene encoding dihydroflavonol-4-reductase,  
 
which is an enzyme participating in pigment biosynthetic 
pathway, from maize and introducing it into petunia 
(Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 
2305/90; Nature, vol.330, p.677-678, 1987). Further, a 
report has been made of a case in which new pigment 
patterns were produced by introducing the chalcone 
synthase gene of petunia at the sense or anti-sense 
orientation to partially inhibit the expression of the 
gene (Nature, vol.333, p.866-869, 1988; The Plant Cell, 
vol.2, p.279-289, 1990; The Plant Cell, vol.2, p.291-299, 
1990). Biosynthetic pathways for anthocyanins, which 
contribute to blue or red color of flowers, have been 
studied genetically and biochemically in detail using 
petunia and others (Petunia, Edited by K. C. Sink, 
Springer Verlag, p.49-76, 1984; The Flavonoids, Edited by 
J. B. Harborne, Chapman and Hall, p.399-425, 1988; 
Molecular Approaches to Crop Improvement, Edited by E. S. 
Denis and D. J. Rewerin, Springer Verlag, p.127-148, 
1991). As a result of these studies, it is shown that 
the presence/absence of hydroxyl group at the 3'- and 5'-positions 
of the B
