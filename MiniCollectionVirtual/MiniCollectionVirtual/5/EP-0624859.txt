<ABSTRACT>
Traffic information is gathered by traffic centres (TC) and 
quite frequently it is desired to alert drivers to the presence 

of a hazard which can be avoided if an early warning can be 
given. However as most hazards are of local interest then in 

order to avoid transmitting the early warning nationally, a 
system is used to transmit the early warning to suitably equipped 

vehicles using the digital cellular radio network. In view of 
the fact that the location of the network's base stations 

(BS1 to 3, BS20 and BS21) and their contemporaneous coverage 
areas may be unknown to the traffic centres it is necessary for 

the traffic centres to relay a description of the geographical 
area over which an early warning should be given to the control 

computer (C) of the cellular network so that the control computer 
can decide which of the base stations provide a combined coverage 

area most closely matching the description of the geographical 
area and activate the transmitters of the selected base 

stations.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of, and system
for, describing a geographical area to a communications network
in order to restrict the transmission of data to that area. The
present invention has particular, but not exclusive, application
for relaying traffic information to vehicles in a predetermined
geographical areas.In many countries there already exist information centres
which gather and retain information about road traffic flow
behaviour for example that traffic is flowing freely through a
junction, that traffic lights have failed causing a traffic jam
and that there has been an accident and traffic has been held
up. Such information is regularly broadcast over public radio
systems so that anyone having a suitably tuned receiver hears the
information irrespective of whether they have any interest in it.Road traffic information and vehicle navigation systems are
currently under development in different countries of the world.
A European wide project called SOCRATES envisages communicating
information to a computer carried in a vehicle by radio using the
GSM digital cellular telephone network. As the information to be
transmitted may be relevant to a relatively small geographical
area only it is pointless for an entire network to broadcast such
information nationwide.Although the locations of most cellular telephone or
cellular radio base stations are fixed, operators frequently want
to keep such information confidential. Additionally depending on
the current level of telephone or radio traffic through a base
station and/or the serviceability of the base station, the
network operator may want to reconfigure his network by altering
the size and/or shape of the coverage area of one or more base
stations for example by varying the transmitter output power 
and/or modifying the antenna arrangement to make transmissions
directional rather than omnidirectional. In view of this a
traffic centre which is operated independently of a cellular
telephone or radio network cannot for example instruct a cellular
network operator which particular base stations of the network
should carry traffic information relating to an incident.According to one aspect of the present invention there is
provided a method of describing a geographical area to a
communications network, comprising determining the shape of the
geographical area and the location of at least one point lying
symmetrically in the geographical area or on the perimeter of the
area, encoding the location of the at least one point as an angle
of

A method of describing a geographical area to a
communications network, comprising determining the shape of the

geographical area and the location of at least one point lying
symmetrically in the geographical area or on the perimeter of the

area, encoding the location of the at least one point as an angle
of latitude and an angle of longitude and encoding the shape of

the geographical area as a series of bits, and transmitting the
description of the geographical area as a single code word or a

plurality of concatenated code words.
A method of relaying road traffic information to
vehicles in a predetermined geographical area, comprising

determining the size and shape of the geographical area in which
vehicles should receive a particular item of road traffic

information, encoding details of the geographical area as angles
of latitude and longitude of at least one point lying

symmetrically in or on the perimeter of the area and as an
indication of its shape, transmitting said encoded details as a

single code word or concatenated code words to a control computer
of a cellular radio network comprising a plurality of

geographically distributed radio transmitters, determining from
the received encoded details which of the radio transmitters will

provide a coverage area most closely matching the geographical
area and activating those radio transmitters to relay the item of

road traffic information.
A method as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that encoded information relating to a particular geographical

area is stored in a look up table and in that the code word
comprises the address of the entry in the look up table.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised
in that a symmetrically shaped geographical area is encoded as

the angles of latitude and longitude of the centre of the area
together with an indication of the relative length of one

dimension of the area.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised  
in that a geographical area requiring n points to describe it,

where n is an integer greater than 1, is described by the angles
of latitude and longitude of each point.
A method as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised
in that a geographical area requiring n points to describe it,

where n is an integer greater than 1, is described by giving the
angles of latitude and longitude of one of the n points and by

indications of the angular changes in latitude and longitude
between the said one of the n points and a next following point,

and, if required, between the next following point and a further
point, and so on.
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that
said indications of angular changes are expressed in the same

degree of resolution as the latitude and longitude of the one of
the n points.
A method as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7, characterised
in that the latitude and longitude of the one of the n points are

expressed with a high resolution in two concatenated code words.
A system for relaying road traffic information to
vehicles in a predetermined geographical area in which radio

transmitters of a cellular network are located, comprising means
for determining the size and shape of the geographical area,

means for encoding a description of the geographical area as the
angles of latitude and longitude of at least one point lying

symmetrically in or on the perimeter of the area and as an
indication of its shape, means for relaying the description to a

cellular radio network, the cellular radio network having means
for storing the locations and contemporaneous coverage areas of

all the transmitters in the network, means for determining from
the received description which of the transmitters can

geographical area described and means for generating road traffic

information and for activating the relevant transmitters.
A system as claimed in claim 9, characterised in that
said means for determining the size and shape of a geographical 

area has means for storing a map of the road network of a larger
area and means for determining the shape of the geographical area

in dependence of the road network within and adjacent to said
area.
