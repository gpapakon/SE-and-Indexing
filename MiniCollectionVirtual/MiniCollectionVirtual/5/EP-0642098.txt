<ABSTRACT>
A financial service plastic card, which is fraud - and counterfeit - 
proof, is provided, consisting of two plastic card elements (1) and (3), 

destined to be separately despatched to the cardholder, the first of which 
bears on the respective memory zone (2) an encoding to operate the 

account as a financial service card but unable yet to activate the latter and 
the second bears on the respective memory zone (4) an encoding acting as 

a key to activate said account before the first transaction is completed. 
Only through the consecutive reading of the encodings of the two card 

elements at the first transaction the first card element (1) turns into an 
effective financial service card for all transactions. A numbered seal (5) 

provisionally carried by the second card element (3) is adhesively 
transposed on the first element (1), before said reading, and serves to 

protect the signature on the proper panel (6) of said first element for 
guaranteeing the validity of the authorized signature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to financial service cards, as credit 
cards and debit cards, made of plastic material and provided with a 
memory zone, and more precisely it regards devices to prevent fraud with 
said payment means, and the counterfeiting thereof. The fraudulent transactions made with financial service cards often 
depend from a faulty or neglected identification of the presenter, who can 
achieve his goals with a forged apocryphal signature, expecially by the 
means of a financial service card diverted from the mail before it arrives 
into the cardholder's possession. The need of preventing said drawbacks is obvious. A common interest exists that newly emitted or re-issued financial 
service cards cannot be used until they have come into the cardholder's 
possession and that the presenters of said financial service cards may be 
actually identified as the legitimate cardholders for all financial service 
cards transactions completed before a merchant. For the sake of semplicity in the description the expression 
"financial service card" has been hereinafter substituted by the word 
"card". The primary purpose of the invention is to bring forth a financial 
service card, which cannot be used before it has come in the cardholder's 
possession and without express validation of the latter. Another purpose of the invention is that the merchant can realize 
from said card whether the presenter actually is, or is not, the legitimate 
cardholder. A further purpose of the invention is that the merchant can verify 
signature correspondence on transaction records with the authorized 
signature on the signature panel of said card.  The published French application NÂ°2,638,002 teachs a provisional 
combination of two plastic cards, namely a user card and a habilitation 
card, each provided with encodable zone, intended for personalizing the 
user card for cultural and social services through the transfer of data from 
the chips of the habilitation card to the chips of the user card. Object of the present invention is a fraud- and counterfeit- proof 
financial service plastic card, as a credit card and a debit card, which is 
characterized by the fact that such card consists of a provisional 
combination of two plastic card elements in a manner known per se both 
provided with a memory zone, as a magnetic strip, chips an the like, of 
which the first card element, namely a user card, bears on the respective 
memory zone a standard encoding to operate the cardholder's account in a 
host-computer but

<CLAIMS>
1) A financial service plastic card, as a credit card and a debit card, 
which is fraud- and counterfeit-proof and provided with a memory zone 

characterized by the fact that such card consists of a provisional 
combination of two plastic card elements (1) and (3) known per se both 

provided with a memory zone (2) and (4), as a magnetic strip, chips and 
the like, the first card element (1), namely a user card, bearing on the 

respective memory zone (2) a standard encoding to operate the cardholder 
account in a host-computer, but enabled yet to activate said account, and 

the second card element (3), namely an activating card, bearing on the 
respective memory zone (4) an encoding acting as a complementary key to 

activate the cardholder account, only before the first transaction can be 
completed, said complementary card elements being destined to be 

separately despatched to the cardholder, so that only through the 
consecutive reading of the encodings of the two card elements at the first 

transaction the account is rendered operative, so that the first card element 
turns into an effective financial service card for using said account, while 

the activating second card element is kept at side. 
2) Financial service card in claim 1 characterized by the fact that the 
second card element (3) provisionally carries a security transparent seal (5), 

which before the consecutive reading of the two encodings is adhesively 
transposed on the signature panel of the first card element (1) to protect 

the authorized signature and which consists of a fragile transparent inking 
and varnishing multilayer lamina (7) provisionally anchored on one face 

of the second card element and coated with an adhesive layer protected by 
a liner on its free side, said lamina incorporating a reference number (8) 

corresponding to one of the numbers appearing on the financial service 
 

card. 
3) A financial service plastic card as in claims 1 or 2 characterized by the 
fact that the memory zone of the second card element also bears an 

encoding to eventually block the cardholder's account when read through 
a network card terminal. 
4) A financial service plastic card as in claims 1 to 3 characterized by the 
fact that the second card element can be later used for other purposes, e. g. 

to report the loss of the card or to identify the cardholder in other 
circumstances within the logic and legitimate interest of the issuer.
