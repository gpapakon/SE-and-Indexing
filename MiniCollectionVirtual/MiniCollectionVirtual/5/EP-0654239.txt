<ABSTRACT>
Display hanger of flat construction (1) comprising a hook part (2) and transversely spaced means (3, 4) for holding said article (5), and comprising two parallel arms (7, 8) defining between themselves a cavity (11) in which the article (5) can be inserted and an intermediate arm (10) between said arms (7, 8). The intermediate arm (10) is generally parallel with said arms (7, 8) and defines with the second of said arms (8) a slot (13) communicating with said cavity (11). A guide means (15) is provided in said cavity in order, especially when the article (5, 6) hanging on the hanger is pulled so as to remove it from the hanger, to guide the article in the direction of said slot and away from the free end (12) of said intermediate arm (10).

<CLAIMS>
Display coat-hanger, particularly for textile articles, in the form of a
plate (1) having a suspension portion (2) in the form of a hook and transversely

spaced means (3, 4) for holding said article, each of the holding
means having two parallel branches (7, 8) defining 
between them a reception
cavity (11) for the article and an intermediate branch (10), extending

between said branches (7, 8), connected by one end to a first (7) of said
branches and whose free end is directed towards said cavity, said inter-mediate

branch (10) being substantially parallel to said branches (7, 8)
and defining with the second of said branches (8) a slot (13) communicating

with said cavity (11), characterized in that a guidance means (15) is provided
in said cavity, so that during the application of a tension to an

article (5, 6) held on the coat-hanger, with a view to separating it from
the coat-hanger, it guides the article towards said slot (13) away from the

free end (12) of said intermediate branch (10).
Display coat-hanger according to claim 1, characterized in that the
guidance means is constituted by an inclined bearing surface (15) formed in

said cavity (11) and extending in the direction of said slot (13) from said
first branch (7) so that it is essentially perpendicular to the free end

(12) of the intermediate branch (10).
Display coat-hanger according to claim 2, characterized in that said
inclined bearing surface (15) is produced on a lug (14), preferably having a

substantially triangular shape and projecting from the first branch (7).
Display coat-hanger according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized
in that the free end (12) of the intermediate branch (10) has a

blunt shape, particularly having at least one end flange.
Display coat-hanger according to any one of the preceding claims for
textile articles having an increased thickness area, particularly for under-clothing

such as panties or the like having an elastic belt, characterized
in that said cavity (11) serves to at least partly hold said increased

thickness area (6) of the article (5).
