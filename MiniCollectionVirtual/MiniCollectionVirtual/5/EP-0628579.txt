<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid resin 
which can be applied without a solvent, a process for the 
production thereof, and a substantially solventless or 
solvent-free coating composition. For coating cans or containers formed of metals or 
plastic films, coating compositions containing organic 
solvents are conventionally used. Conventional coating 
compositions release or dissipate a large amount of organic 
solvents at the steps of their application and drying for 
curing them. With a deepening interest in global or 
working environments, limitations are being imposed on the 
use of such coating compositions. As one method to cope 
with the limitations, a water-based coating composition or 
powder has been proposed, while the water-based coating 
composition still contains an organic solvent to some extent 
for improving the dispersibility of a pigment and the 
coatability, so that problems on safety and hygiene in a 
working environment still remain to be solved. Further, 
additional cost is required for the incineration of 
released organic solvent and for the treatment of waste 
water. In a large-scaled coating plant having facilities 
for treating exhaust gases, it is possible to prevent the 
release of organic solvents into atmosphere. In a 
small-scaled plant having no such facilities, organic 
solvents may be disposed of, while it is difficult to treat 
waste water. Further, for using a powder coating 
composition, the application machine and method are greatly 
different from conventional ones, and it is hence required  
 
to employ a novel machine. For overcoming the above problems, the development 
of a high-solid coating composition and the improvement in a 
water-based coating composition are under way. It is 
therefore assumed that the use of coating compositions 
containing organic solvents tends to decrease more 
remarkably. For fundamentally solving the above problems, 
however, it has been and is desired to develop a solventless 
coating composition which is free of problems such as 
environmental pollution, safety and hygiene problems, 
inflammability and explosion, which can permit the 
application in a wide range and which can be applied with 
ease. For meeting the above desire, JP-A-57-171 discloses a 
method using a liquid resin from an acryl monomer. However, 
the resin obtained is an oligomer having a molecular weight 
of 8,000 or less, or a low-molecular-weight substance is 
contained in a coating composition. As a result, the low-molecular-weight 
substance may
