<ABSTRACT>
A connector requiring minimal insertion force and 
forming a reliable connection has a female terminal and a 

male terminal. A shaft portion of the male terminal is 
insertable into a closed end insertion tubular portion of 

the female terminal. The shaft portion has an expanding 
slot extending along a length thereof. A projection is 

provided within the insertion tubular portion near the 
closed end. A bore diameter of the insertion tubular 

portion is larger than a diameter of a portion of the 
shaft portion that is to be first inserted. At a final 

stage of an insertion operation, the projection fits in 
the expanding slot. Accordingly, at the final stage of 

the insertion operation, the shaft portion is forcibly 
expanded radially outward and brought into contact with 

the bore wall of the insertion tubular portion at a 
predetermined contact pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connector terminal, 
and more particularly to a connector terminal for 
connecting large electrical currents. In a commonly-used connector, a male terminal is 
inserted into a female terminal, thereby forming an 
electrical connection. In this case, particularly in the 
type of connector for dealing with a larger current, a 
highly reliable connection between the two terminals is 
required. Therefore, a construction shown in Fig. 7 is 
adopted. This figure shows one of many pairs of mating 
terminals provided in female and male connector housings 
that are to be fitted together. The female terminal 20 shown in Fig. 7 has an 
insertion tubular portion 21 at its front portion, and the 
male terminal 22 has a shaft portion 23, which can be 
inserted into the insertion tubular portion 21. In this 
case, the outer diameter of the shaft portion 23 is 
slightly larger than a bore diameter of the insertion 
tubular portion 21; and the shaft portion 23 is divided 
along an axial direction by an expanding slot 24 extending 
along a longitudinal axis thereof. With this arrangement, 
by forcibly deforming the entire shaft portion 23 radially 
inward, the shaft portion 23 can be inserted into the 
tubular portion 21. Accordingly, when the male terminal 
22 and the female terminal 20 are connected, an adequate 
contact pressure can be achieved due to a resilient 
restoring force of the shaft portion 23 of the male 
terminal 22. However, the following problems have been 
encountered with the above connector construction. First, 
in the above construction, a large contact resistance is 
maintained over a time period starting with the insertion 
of the terminal 22 into the terminal 20 until completion 
of the insertion operation. Therefore, the insertion 
operation is difficult, in particular, because the larger 
an allowable current is, the larger the size of the  
 
terminals become, and therefore a larger insertion force 
is needed to construct the connector. Furthermore, when the insertion and withdrawal of 
the terminal are repeated, or when the terminals remain in 
an inserted position for a long period of time, the 
resilient restoring force of the male terminal 22 may be 
decreased, and as a result, the contact pressure is 
decreased. In addition, when the terminals are in a 
withdrawn position, the outer diameter of a front end of 
the shaft portion 23 is larger than the bore diameter of 
the insertion tubular portion 21, and therefore the 
insertion at an initial stage is difficult.
