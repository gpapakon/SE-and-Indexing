<CLAIMS>
A switching device for transmitting telecommunication signals between an exchange (VST)
of a telephone network and at least one subscriber (TL) connected thereto, with which

metering pulses in addition to voice signals can also be transmitted by the exchange, in
which the exchange on the one hand, and the subscriber on the other, are each allocated

system units (SV, ST), between which the voice signals are transmitted as digital signals
via a two-wire line (L), in which the system units, in addition to analog/digital converters,

have a hybrid switching unit with a transformer (Ãœ) for connecting a two-wire system to a
four-wire system, and in which the two-wire system containing the primary winding (1) of

the transformer is connected to the exchange, while the two-wire line leading to the
subscriber is connected to a four-wire system, consisting of a transmitting branch (A) and a

receiving branch (E), and containing the secondary winding (2) of the transformer,
characterized in
that the two-wire system contains a parallel resonant circuit (P), which consists of an
inductance (3) and a capacitor (4),
that a passive filter (8) and an active filter (9) are connected in series in the receiving
branch of the hybrid switching unit,
that the passive filter (8) is tuned for attenuating the pulse frequency and
that the active filter (9) is tuned to the passive filter (8), so as to compensate for a
decrease in the level of the voice signals caused by the passive filter (8), by

generating a corresponding increase in the voice signal.
A switching device according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that a double-T filter is used as
the passive filter (8).
A switching device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that a filter having at least
two stages is used as the active filter (9).
