<ABSTRACT>
Heating wires (2), connected in parallel, are arranged in the intermediate thermoplastic layer (15) of a laminated window (1) which can be heated electrically. The heating wires (2) are in electrical contact with busbars (6). The busbars (6) consist of two metal strips (10, 12) between which the heating wires (2) are placed. Between the two metal strips (10, 12) is placed a layer (14) of an electrically conductive adhesive, firmly joined to the two foil strips (10, 12) and to the heating wires (2), and which tightly encloses these wires. This reliably prevents formation of capillaries between the foil strips, along the heating wires (2) and the diffusion of moisture which would impair the electrical contact between the heating wires (2) and the busbars.

<CLAIMS>
Laminated glazing which can be electrically heated, having heating 
wires placed in the intermediate, thermoplastics material layer and connected 

in parallel and which, along at least one of the edges of the glazing, 
are embedded between two foil ribbons perpendicular to the heating wires 

and which are in electrical contact with said foil ribbons, which serve as 
bus-bars, characterized in that an electricity-conducting adhesive layer 

(14) is placed between the two foil ribbons (10, 12) and hermetically 
covers the heating wires (2). 
Laminated glazing which can be heated electrically according to claim 1, 
characterized in that the electricity-conducting adhesive layer (14) has a 

thickness corresponding to the diameter of the heating wires (2). 
Laminated glazing which can be electrically heated according to claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that the adhesive layer (4) covering the heating 

wires (2) is constituted by contact adhesive and covers at least the copper 
foil ribbon (10) placed below the heating wires (2), at least on the face 

in contact with said heating wires (2). 
Laminated glazing which can be electrically heated according to claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the copper foil ribbon (12) placed above the 

heating wires (2) is provided, on its upper face, with an adhesive coating 
(19), which brings about a tight assembly, preventing diffusion, from the 

copper foil ribbon (12) and the glass sheet (16). 
Laminated glazing can be electrically heated according to one of the 
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the copper foil ribbons (10, 12) 

constituting the bus-bars (5, 6) are provided on both their faces with a 
contact adhesive layer (14, 18, 19). 
Laminated glazing which can be electrically heated according to one of 
the claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the heating wires (2) are 20 to 40 

Âµm thick tungsten wires.
