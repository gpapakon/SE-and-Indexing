<ABSTRACT>
A cover plate (12) with cushioned mat (18) is rotatably mounted on a bottom plate (16). The cushioned mat (18) is fixed on the cover plate (12) by an integral, rigid retention ring (20), an inner bead (34) of the retention ring (20) engaging clampingly under an outer bead (26) of the cover plate (12). An annular groove (22) near the outer edge of the cover plate (12) causes the remaining annular wall (24) with the marginal bead (26) to be connected to the rotating plate (12) only via a thin web, this web representing a bending zone (28), so that when the retention ring (20) is lifted off the annular wall (24) acts as a resilient tongue and can be moved elastically inwards.

Turntable serving as a seat surface for handicapped 
persons, comprising a bottom plate (16), a top 

plate (12) pivotably mounted thereon, a padded 
cushion (18) disposed centrally on said top plate 

(12), and an integral retaining ring (20) with a 

circular outline, releasably fixed to said top 
plate (12) and overlapping said padded cushion (18) 

at its circumferential edge, gripping the top and 
bottom of the outer edge of said top plate (12) 

like a hook and resting thereon so as to clamp it, 
characterised in that, closely adjacent to the 

outer edge of the top plate (12), an annular groove 
(22) is provided in said top plate (12), which 

extends along at least part of the periphery and 
terminates at one of the two surfaces of the top 

plate (12), comprising the top side and the bottom 
side, and that a thin-walled flexible zone (28) is 

formed between the bottom of said annular groove 
(22) and the adjacent surface of the top plate 

(12), and an annular wall (24) is formed between 
the annular groove (22) and the outer peripheral 

surface of the top plate (12), which, by the 
exertion of radially inward force, can be displaced 

in this direction with a resilient restoring 
effect. 
Turntable as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the annular groove (22) terminates at the 

bottom surface of the top plate (12).  
 
Turntable as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the top plate (12) has regularly spaced 

marginal recesses (44) in the regions of which the 
annular wall (24) is interrupted. 
Turntable as claimed in Claim 3, characterised in 
that the circumferential length of each of the 

marginal recesses (44) is at least equal to that of 
the portion of annular wall (22) formed between 

each pair of marginal recesses (44). 
Turntable as claimed in Claim 4, characterised in 
that the circumferential length of each portion of 

annular wall (24) is approximately half as great as 
that of the marginal recess (44). 
Turntable as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the annular wall (24) has a 

conical supporting surface (30) at the bottom, 
terminating at the outer circumferential surface of 

said annular wall (24), with the inner marginal 
beading (34) of the retaining ring (20) resting in 

a clamped manner on said supporting surface (30). 
Turntable as claimed in Claim 6, characterised in 
that the conical supporting surface (30) is formed 

on marginal beading (26) projecting outwardly from 
the annular wall (24). 
Turntable as claimed in Claim 7, characterised in 
that the top surface of the marginal beading (26) 

of the annular wall is likewise formed as a conical 
operating surface (32), though in this case rising 

inwardly from the outside.  
 
Turntable as claimed in one of the Claims 6 to 8, 
characterised in that the top surface of the inner 

marginal beading (34) of the retaining ring (20) is 
formed as a retaining surface (36) dropping 

conically inwards from the outside, which rests 
over a large area on the supporting surface (30) of 

the top plate(12), in a clamping fashion. 
Turntable as claimed in one of the Claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that, in the region where the 

retaining ring (20) and padded cushion (18) 
overlap, the top plate (12) has a concentric 

arrangement of spikes (42) pointing upwards, the 
heigt of which is only slightly less than the width 

of a gap formed between the retaining ring (20) and 
the top surface of the top plate (12) for receiving 

the edge of the padded cushion (18).
