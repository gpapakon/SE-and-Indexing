<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing composite parts, in which:     - short reinforcing fibres (3) are placed in a transfer mould (4); - the short reinforcing fibres (3) are impregnated with a low-viscosity resin; - the short reinforcing fibres impregnated with the resin are held in this mould (4), at a temperature called the gelling temperature, until obtaining a pasty preform (6) whose viscosity is suitable for compression moulding;   - the pasty preform (6) is demoulded; - the said pasty preform (6) is placed in a compression mould (7) heated to a compression temperature greater than the gelling temperature; - the compression moulding of the pasty preform (6) is carried out;   - the pasty preform (6) is polymerized at at least one temperature greater than or equal to the said compression temperature.

A process for production of composite parts in 

which: 

short reinforcing fibres (3) are placed in a 
transfer mould (4); 
the short reinforcing fibres (2) are infiltrated 
by a low-viscosity resin; 
the short reinforcing fibres infiltrated by said 
resin are kept in this mould (4), at a temperature 

known as the gelation temperature, until a pasty 
preform (6) is obtained, the viscosity of which is 

suitable for compression moulding; 
the pasty preform (6) is demoulded; 
said pasty preform (6) is positioned in a 
compression mould (7) brought to a compression 

temperature greater than the gelation temperature; 
the pasty preform (6) is compression-moulded; 
the pasty preform (6) is polymerised at at least 
one temperature higher than or equal to said 

compression temperature. 
A process for production of composite parts 
according to claim 1, characterised in that upon the 

infiltration of the resin the transfer mould (4), 
filled with short reinforcing fibres (3), is closed at 

a height corresponding to the theoretical density of 
the finished product. 
A process for production of composite parts 
according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in 

that, upon the infiltration of the short reinforcing 
fibres (3), the viscosity of the resin is less than or 

equal to 100 centipoise. 
A process for production of composite parts 
according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in 

that, at the end of the stay in the transfer mould (4), 
the pasty preform (6) obtained has a viscosity such  

 
that the penetration of a penetrometer needle into the 

pure resin is between 105 and 175 tenths of a 
millimetre. 
A process for production of composite parts 
according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 

that the polymerisation reaction is continued outside 
the compression mould (7).
