<DESCRIPTION>
Obsessive-compulsive disorder is one of the rarer 
psychiatric illnesses, although minor obsessional symptoms 
probably occur in one-sixth of the population (Encyclopedia ofMedicine, American Medical Association; Current Diagnosis, 
W.B.Saunders Company, 1985). It is characterized by one or both 
of two symptoms. The first comprises recurrent, intrusive 
ruminative thoughts that the patient may realize are senseless 
but of which he cannot stop thinking. The most common of these 
are thoughts of violence, contamination, doubt, or personal 
illness. Normally, the patient does not believe these thoughts 
are true reflections of reality. However, some patients become 
convinced that their obsessive ruminations are true, and suffer 
from psychotic delusions. The second comprises repetitive, ritualistic behaviors 
that the patient recognizes are needless but that he cannot keep 
himself from performing. Hand washing, counting, checking 
rituals, and touching rituals are examples of such rituals. The 
carrying out of the ritual is not constant, but fluctuates and 
mirrors anxiety levels. There normally are intense feelings of 
panic and anxiety if the patient is prevented from completing a 
ritual. While appearing depressed a review of the history of 
obsessive-compulsive patients normally reveals that obsessions 
and compulsions precede the onset of dysphoric mood states and 
that depressed feelings are related to the impact the obsessive-compulsive 
behaviour has on life. In severe cases, the patient 
will be incapacitated, completely overtaken by the distraction 
of constant obsessive ruminations or the demand to complete 
endless compulsive rituals. Consumptive disorders include those disorders in which 
the intake, normally oral, of the amount of a substance is 
outside a normal range, often to an extent where health is 
impaired. Examples of such are eating or appetite disorders 
(obesity, bulimia, pica, anorexia nervosa, and psychogenic  
 
rumination) and substance abuse or overuse (smoking, nicotine 
dependence, alcoholism, alcohol abuse). It is well known that the chronic administration of 
nicotine results in tolerance and, eventually, dependence. The 
use of tobacco has become extremely widespread in all countries, 
despite the well known adverse effects of the use of tobacco in 
all its forms. Thus, it is clear that tobacco use is extremely 
habit-forming, if not addictive, and that its use provides 
sensations to the user which are pleasant and welcome, even 
though the user is fully aware of
