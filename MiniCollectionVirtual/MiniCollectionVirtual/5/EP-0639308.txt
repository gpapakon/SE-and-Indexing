<ABSTRACT>
In order to drive a MOS field effect transistor as a voltage cutter in a direct voltage converter which works according to the chopping principle, a circuit arrangement has an input transistor (T1) for driving a current source at the input side with a low voltage swing, a phase inverter transistor (T2) connected downstream thereof and a complementary stage formed of first and second supplementary transistors (T3, T4) with interconnected collectors. An auxiliary voltage is added to the input voltage to be regulated. Thanks to different current switching thresholds for the first supplementary transistor (T3) and for the phase inverter transistor (T2) that drives the second supplementary transistor (T4), the complementary stage switches without overlapping. In addition, it switches with a switching-on delay, so that the switching time of a series-connected switching regulator component can be increased up to 100 %. The own current requirements of the circuitry are thus very low.

Circuit arrangement for driving an MOS field-effect 
transistor (T5) as a power switching element in a 

DC/DC voltage converter operating on the chopper principle, 
having a pair of complementary transistors formed 

from two further transistors (T3, T4) whose bases are 
driven with in-phase control signals originating from an 

input transistor (T1), and having a voltage limiter 
circuit, characterized in that the base of the first 

further transistor (T3) is connected to the collector of 
the input transistor (T1), which collector is connected 

to means (R1) for setting a current switching threshold 
value for the first further transistor (T3), and the base 

of the second further transistor (T4) is connected to the 
collector of a phase reversing transistor (T2), which 

collector is connected to a supply voltage (Uh2) via a 
load resistor (R4),

a current switching threshold value for the phase 

reversing transistor (T2),
 
in that a capacitor (C1) is arranged between the base of 

the second further transistor (T4) and a reference 
potential of the circuit arrangement, for a switching-on 

delay of the second further transistor (T4), which 
switching-on delay is additional to a switching-on delay 

which is governed by a storage time occurring in the 
phase reversing transistor (T2), and in that the means 

(R1; R2, R3) for setting the current switching threshold  
 

values of the first further transistor (T3) and of the 
phase reversing transistor (T2) are selected in such a 

manner that the current switching threshold value of the 
phase reversing transistor (T2) is lower than the current 

switching threshold value of the first further transistor 
(T3).

in that an output (A) of the circuit arrangement 

is provided between the first and the second further

suppression resistor (R6) is connected, with a free 
connection side for connection to the source (S) of the 

MOS field-effect transistor (T5). 
Circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a series circuit 

comprising two diodes (D3, D4) which are connected such 
that they face one another is arranged between the base 

and the collector of the first further transistor (T3) in 
such a manner that the connection of the base of the 

first further transistor (T3) to the collector of the 
input transistor (T1) is produced via one of the diodes 

(for example D3).

preceding claims, characterized in that a series circuit 

comprising two diodes (D1, D2) which are connected 
pointing away from one another is arranged between the 

connection of the base of the second further transistor

(T2) in such a manner that the collector of the phase 
reversing transistor (T2) and the base of the second 

further transistor (T4) are connected via one of the 
diodes (for example 2) to the matched means (R4) via 

which a connection to the associated supply voltage (Uh2) 
is provided. 
Circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that a low-value

collector of the input transistor (T1), is arranged in  

 
the collector path of the input transistor (T1). 
Circuit arrangement according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the two further
