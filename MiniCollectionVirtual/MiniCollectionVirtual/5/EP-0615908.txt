<ABSTRACT>
Device for successively manufacturing and filling 
bags starting from a strip of weldable material, which 

device comprises a frame (1), a stock holder for a roll of 
the weldable material (M) supported by the frame, a standing 

filling tube (4) or supply of the product for packaging, 
folding means for the strip of material arranged at the 

top end of the filling tube, a heating element (7) arranged 
adjacently of the filling tube for forming a longitudinal 

seam in order to obtain a continuous tube of packaging 
material, and two clamping members (9) movable toward and 

away from each other with at least a pair of heating 
elements for forming in each case a transverse seam under 

the filling tube in order to obtain a bag, in addition to 
separation means for separating a filled and welded 

closed bag, wherein by each clamping member on either end 
of the heating element for the transverse seam is arranged 

an additional heating element (10) for arranging a weld 
seam which encloses an angle with the transverse seam, 

wherein a plate-like folding member can be carried between 
these clamping jaws in order to obtain a rectangular 

bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for successively 
manufacturing and filling bags starting from a strip of 
weldable material, which device comprises a frame, a 
stock holder for a roll of the weldable material supported 
by the frame, a standing filling tube for supply of 
the product for packaging, folding means for the strip of 
material arranged at the top end of the filling tube, a 
heating element arranged adjacently of the filling tube 
for forming a longitudinal seam in order to obtain a 
continuous tube of packaging material and two clamping 
members movable toward and away from one another with at 
least a pair of heating elements for forming in each case 
a transverse seam under the filling tube in order to 
obtain a bag, in addition to separation means for separating 
a filled and welded closed bag. Such a device offers the advantage that during 
manufacture the bags are also filled and that this can 
therefore take place in a continuous process. Filling 
takes place after a transverse weld has been arranged in 
the tube, whereafter the tube is fed through stepwise and 
another transverse weld can be arranged to close the bag. 
Finally, the filled bag can be severed. The drawback to 
such a formed bag is that the contents can remain behind 
in the folds of the corners close to the transverse 
welds, whereby the bag cannot be emptied entirely. This 
can be disadvantageous in the case of substances which 
have an impact on the environment. The invention has for its object to provide a device 
wherein these "dead" corners are no longer present in the 
bags and the above stated drawback is therefore obviated. The device according to the invention is distinguished 
in that by each clamping member on either end of 
the heating element for the transverse seam is arranged 
an additional heating element for arranging a weld seam  
 
which encloses an angle with the transverse seam, wherein 
a plate-like folding member can be carried between these 
clamping jaws. Due to the arranging of the angular welds which 
connect onto the transverse welds the "dead" space in the 
corners is closed off, whereby none of the material in 
the bag can nestle in these corners. It is noted that the 
angular welds are arranged on either side of a fold of 
the bag, whereby a rectangular bag results. The stackability 
of the obtained bag is thereby improved. In a further development the heating element for 
making the angular weld is embodied as a rotatably mounted 
stamp associated with each clamping jaw. Thus achieved
