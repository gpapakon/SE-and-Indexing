<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thickened aqueous 
bleaching and cleaning compositions based on hypochlorite. Liquid compositions comprising hypochlorite bleach and 
the combination of long chain amine oxides and fatty acids as 
a thickening agent therein are well-known in the art. It is desirable that such compositions should have good 
cleaning properties. However, long chain amine oxides do not 
provide the optimum cleaning effect. Therefore, it is a first 
object of the present invention to provide hypochlorite based 
bleaching compositions with improved cleaning.  In response to this object, it has now been found that 
the incorporation of short chain surfactants is beneficial 
and meets this object thereby enhancing the cleaning 
performance. However, it has been observed that the 
incorporation of short chain surfactants in such compositions 
results in the reduction of the viscosity of said 
compositions. Yet, it is considered highly desirable that 
said compositions should be viscous so that the compositions 
adhere longer to vertical surfaces and surfaces which are 
inclined to the horizontal. Therefore it is a further object of the present 
invention to provide a liquid composition which comprises a 
hypochlorite bleach and short chain surfactants, which 
retains viscosity. In response to this object, the present invention 
proposes to formulate a liquid composition which comprises 
long chain amine oxides and fatty acids, further comprising 
short chain surfactants to boost cleaning and a long chain 
tertiary alcohol to restore viscosity. A further advantage of the present invention is that the 
stability of the bleach is not affected by the tertiary 
alcohol which resists the oxidation of the hypochlorite. Thickened bleaching compositions comprising long chain 
amine oxides and fully saturated fatty acids are well-known 
in the art. US 4 282 109 discloses a thickened bleach composition 
comprising hypochlorite and linear and branched long chain 
C₁₀-C₁₈ amine oxides as thickeners. There is no mention of 
short chain C₆-C₈ amine oxides or tertiary alcohols. EP 274 885 discloses thickened bleaching compositions 
comprising alkali metal hypochlorite and straight chain C₁₄ 
amine oxide with a mixture of branched and straight chain  
 
C₁₅ amine oxide and optionally fatty acids. There is no 
mention of short chain amine oxide or tertiary alcohols. EP 233 666 discloses a process for the manufacture of a 
thickened bleaching compositions comprising hypochlorite, a 
hypochlorite-soluble surfactant
