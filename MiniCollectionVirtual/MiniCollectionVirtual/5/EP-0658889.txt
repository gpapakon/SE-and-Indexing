<ABSTRACT>
An information recording and reproducing apparatus 
for recording and/or reproducing data onto/from a 

recording medium such as magnetic disk, magnetooptic 
disk, or the like by irradiating a laser beam emitted 

from a light source such as a semiconductor laser onto 
a desired track of the recording medium through an 

optical system, wherein the apparatus includes a single 
processor for executing an input/output control of data 

for the apparatus and a servo process of the laser beam 
by interrupting the servo process between the 

input/output control at every predetermined period. 
The processor switches a precision of the servo process 

in accordance with a situation such as a change in 
operating mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
recording and reproducing apparatus having a processor
and its method for recording or reproducing information
to/from a magnetic disk, a magnetooptic disk, or the
like in response to a command of a computer by
connecting the apparatus to a computer.Hitherto, as a secondary memory apparatus of a
host computer, a magnetic disk apparatus, a
magnetooptic disk apparatus, or the like is used. The
host computer and the secondary memory apparatus are
connected by an interface such as an SCSI (Small
Computer System Interface) or the like. In such an
interface, generally, a read command, a write command,
or the like is generated from the host computer to the
apparatus and the host computer can know the end of
execution of the command by a notification from the
apparatus.The operation of the apparatus side will now be
described as an example with respect to a magnetooptic
disk apparatus of 3.5 inches connected to the host 
computer by the SCSI. It is assumed that the
magnetooptic disk apparatus uses a disk according to
the international standard ISO 10090.Fig. 1 shows the operation of the magnetooptic
disk apparatus when a read/write command is received
from the host computer. First, when a CPU which is
provided in the magnetooptic disk apparatus and
executes a command process receives a command, the CPU
analyzes the command in step S1. In this instance, the
CPU discriminates the kind (read, write, etc.) of
command, disk position, data size, and the like. On
the basis of the result of the discrimination, an
address on the disk to be read or written is
calculated. The disk position designated by an SCSI
command by the host computer is a logical position and
its address is expressed by a serial number. On the
other hand, the disk address specified by the ISO 10090
is a physical address and is expressed by a track
number and a sector number. A defective sector and an
alternate sector to relieve its defect are provided in
the disk. Alternation management information to manage
those sectors and the like have also previously been
recorded on the disk. When converting from the logical
address designated by the SCSI to the physical address
of the disk, it is necessary to also check the presence
or absence of the defective sector or the like. When
the physical address of the disk is determined, a 
recording and reproducing head is moved to the physical
address (such an operation is called a seek) in step
S3. The reading or writing operation is executed for
the disk in step

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for performing at least one of the
functions of recording and reproducing data onto or from

a recording medium including:

means for directing a light beam along a desired
track of the recording medium (103) in a read/write mode

in order to perform at least one of the functions of
reading or writing,
means for maintaining the light beam on the same
track in a wait mode without the functions of reading or

writing being performed; and
an actuator for causing relative movement of the
light beam and the medium (103) on the basis of servo

processing,

   the apparatus being characterised by:

a single processor (104) for executing input/output
control of the data for said apparatus and for executing

servo processing of the light beam by interrupting the
input/output control at predetermined periods,
wherein the predetermined period is longer during
the wait mode than during the read/write mode.
A method for performing at least one of the
functions of recording and reproducing data onto or from

a recording medium including the steps of:

directing a light beam along a desired track of the
recording medium (103) in a read/write mode in order to 

perform at least one of the functions of reading or
writing;
maintaining the light beam on the same track in a
wait mode without the functions of reading or writing

being performed;
causing relative movement of the light beam and the
medium (103) on the basis of se
rvo processing,

   the method being characterised in that:

input/output control of the data and servo
processing of the light beam is executed by a single

processor (104) by interrupting the input/output control
by servo processing at predetermined periods,
wherein the predetermined period is longer during
the wait mode than during the read/write mode.
A computer program product means programmed with
machine readable instructions for causing said single

processor (104) to execute input/output control of the
data and to execute servo processing according to claim

1 or 2.
