<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a processed cloth obtained by coating a polyester fiber structure, which is colored 
with a dispersed dye, with a resin, and more particularly to a cloth of coated polyester fiber characterized in that a 

coating resin contains organic peroxide. The present invention also relates to a processed cloth obtained by coating 
a polyester fiber structure, which is colored with a dispersed dye, with a resin, and characterized in that a coating 

resin contains aromatic rings. The present invention further relates to a method of manufacturing cloths of coated 
polyester fiber, characterized in that a resin solution mixed with organic peroxide is applied to a dispersed dye-colored 

polyester fiber structure. The cloth of coated polyester fiber according to the present invention has excellent dye 
migration contamination fastness and washing durability. The method according to the present invention enables the 

above-mentioned coated cloth to be produced stably and very simply without requiring any special equipment, and a 
very large industrial effect to be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coated polyester fiber fabric free from 
disperse dye migration and a production process therefor. Coated fabrics presently generally used are usually woven or knitted fabrics 
of nylon fibers. Various products coated for achieving water-proof water repellency, 
moisture permeable water repellency, air permeability, melt-proof non-flamability, 
etc. are widely used for clothing and industrial services. However, in recent years, the raw material of nylon fibers has suddenly risen 
in price, to further enlarge the difference in price between nylon products and 
polyester products. So, R&D has been actively conducted on the coating of polyester 
fibers as a substitute for nylon fibers, since polyester fibers are superior in 
dimensional stability, strength, light resistance and wide material availability. However, a coated polyester fiber fabric has an inevitable problem in that 
the disperse dye in the polyester fibers migrates into the coating membrane, to 
remarkably stain the product. For example, if a dark colored coating face of a coated polyester fiber 
fabric is kept in contact with a light colored or white colored coating face of 
another coated polyester fiber fabric, the disperse dye on the dark colored face 
easily migrates onto the light colored or white colored coating face, to stain the 
latter. This is because, unlike an acid dye chemically bound with nylon fibers, a 
disperse dye in polyester fibers loosens the fiber substrate, and the dye molecules 
are physically pressed into the fiber substrate, to achieve dyeing. It can also be 
considered that since a disperse dye has solubility and affinity with organic 
solvents and synthetic resins, the coating causes the disperse dye in the fibers to 
migrate into the coating membrane. This problem has been examined by various workers. For example, Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open No. 85-45686 proposes prevention of the migration of a subliming dye 
using a fine metal powder of aluminum, copper or silver, etc. or a metal oxide such 
as potassium titanate, titanium dioxide or stannic oxide, each poor in affinity with  
 
the disperse dye. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 83-4873 and Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 87-53632 propose application of a water repellent agent with 
perfluoroalkyl groups to a fiber structure with a polyurethane resin membrane 
containing porous particles mainly composed of SiOâ‚‚. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
92-174771 proposes coating with a resin composition containing an organic metal 
coordina
