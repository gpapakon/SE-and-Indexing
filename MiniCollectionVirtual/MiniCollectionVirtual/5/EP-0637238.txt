<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the treatment of human
beings suffering from macular degeneration through administration
of L-deprenyl or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt
thereof.According to Penfold et al., Senile Macular
Degeneration, Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science,
1986, 27, pp. 364-371, macular degeneration is one of the leading
registered causes of blindness in the United States and in other
Western countries.Loss of central vision in macular degeneration occurs
as a result of atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. There
have been reports of histiocytic and giant cells in the areas of
breaks in Bruch's membrane and subretinal neovascular membranes.
Light and electron microscope studies of the atrophic cells in
senile macular degeneration patients, carried out post mortem,
show retinal epithelium cellular elements are destroyed, with the
pigment being clumped and adhered to Bruch's membrane. These
morphological studies suggest an inflammatory process induced by
a degradation product or irritant in the area of the destroyed
cells.Macular degeneration of the retina is a progressive
degeneration of the pigmented cells of the retina of unknown
cause. The retina has a similar topographical layer arrangement
of cytoarchitecture as the brain.The six layers of the retina carry out the function of
transmitting light stimuli into a neuronal excitation. The
neuronal stimulus travels from the retinal structures through the
optic nerve, then through the brainstem structure of the lateral
geniculate, and thereafter through the optic radiations to the
occipital final recipient special sensory cortical neurons.The layers of the retina consist of a neuroectodermal
layer of rods and cones, an intermediate layer of bipolar cells,
horizontal cells and Muller's cells, and the inner layers
containing ganglion cells, glia, nerve fibers, and internal 
limiting membrane.The rods and cones are the photoreceptors and consist
of outer segments of laminated plates of cells containing
photoreceptive pigment and inner segments with dense packing of
mitochondria.The macula in the human retina has special cones and
a dense concentration of ganglion cells which permit high
resolution of visual acuity.Pigmented cells occur in the red nucleus, substantia
nigra, and locus coeruleus in the brain. The pigmented cells of
the retina are hexagonal cells lying just externally to the rods
and cones layer of the retina. These cells provide a sheathing
or insulation of melanin pigment and also provide the Vitamin
