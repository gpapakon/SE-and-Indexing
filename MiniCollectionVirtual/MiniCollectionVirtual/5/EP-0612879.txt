<ABSTRACT>
A folding apparatus for the automatic folding of laundry articles comprises a longitudinal-folding apparatus (1) and a transverse-folding apparatus (2) located downstream of the latter. Two laundry conveyors (5, 6) arranged one behind the other in the conveying direction (3) of a laundry article entering from the longitudinal-folding apparatus are present in the transverse-folding apparatus and are spaced from one another by a gap (7) extending essentially over the entire width of the transverse-folding apparatus. A laundry article (4) to be folded transversely is introduced into the gap (7) by means of a folding blade (16) and/or a blowpipe (38) in order to make a first transverse fold. Prior to the introduction, the thickness of the laundry article to be folded was entered on a data-input device (13) or was determined by means of a measuring device (15, 14). The width of the gap can be adjusted on the basis of the determined thickness of the laundry article. An optimum conveyance of the laundry article provided with a first transverse fold is thereby achieved along the gap (7), irrespective of its thickness. Located at the exit end of the gap (7) is a further laundry conveyor (30), the belt (34) of which can change its path of rotation as a result of the adjustment of an adjusting roller (35) in the region of the said gap end. After a second transverse fold has been made, the belt (34) can be lowered in the said region, with the result that the laundry article can pass onto the discharge point (50), without standing in line at a bottle neck.

<CLAIMS>
A folding apparatus for automatic folding of 
flatwork, in particular articles of clothing, with a 

machine frame (27), with a longitudinal folder (1) and a 
transverse folder (2) following thereafter, two laundry 

conveyors (5, 6) being provided disposed in the transverse 
folder one behind the other in the conveying direction (3) 

of a flatwork article (4) arriving from the longitudinal 
folder, and being spaced apart by a gap (7) stretching 

essentially across the entire width of the transverse 
folder, and a flatwork article (4') being introducible 

into the gap while a first transverse fold is made, 
wherein means (8, 9, 9', 9'', 10, 11, 12) are foreseen to 

change the width of the gap and to adjust to the type or 
thickness, respectively, of flatwork article before the 

flatwork article is introduced. 
A folding apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 
wherein a data entry device (13) is provided, it being 

possible to enter data therein on the type of flatwork 
article. 
A folding apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 
wherein the type of flatwork article can be determined by 

means of a measuring device (14), the measuring device 
being foreseen to measure the thickness of the flatwork 

article. 
A folding apparatus as set forth in claim 1, 
wherein the type of flatwork article can be detected from 

the length thereof, a measuring device (15) being provided 
for determining the length of the flatwork article. 
A folding apparatus as set forth in one of the 
claims 1 to 4, wherein in the transverse folder (2) the 

first laundry conveyor (5) in the conveying direction (3) 
of an arriving flatwork article (4) is stationary, and the 

second laundry conveyor (6) which follows in the said  
 

conveying direction is disposed displaceably to change the 
width of the gap (7). 
A folding apparatus as set forth in claim 5, 
wherein to displace the second laundry conveyor (6) 

adjustment means (10, 11, 12) are provided so that the 
width of the gap is adjustable by at least two, preferably 

three, predefined values. 
A folding apparatus as set forth in one of the 

claims 1 to 6, wherein provided over the gap (7) above the 
two laundry conveyors (5, 6) is a folding blade (16) which 

is lowerable and which can be introduced into the gap, the 
folding blade being coupled approximately centrally to a 

pivoted lever (18) whose one end is pivotably connected to 
the machine frame (27) and whose other end is coupled to 

the second laundry conveyor (6). 
A folding apparatus as set forth in one of the 
claims 1 to 7, wherein the two laundry conveyors (5, 6) 

each have lower conveying sections (19, 20) on which 
circulatory belts (23, 24) are disposed whose circulatory 

path is essentially L-shaped in each case, the gap being 
formed between and along two leg sections (25, 26) of the 

belts of the first and of the second laundry conveyor 
turned toward each other and running parallel to each 

other, and extending preferably at about a right angle to 
the said conveying direction (3). 
A folding apparatus as set forth in one of the 
claims 1 to 8, wherein below the two said laundry 

conveyors (5, 6) a further laundry conveyor (30) is 
provided, wherein the further laundry conveyor can be 

driven reversibly and has two upper conveying sections 
(31, 32) and one lower conveying section (33), the first 

upper conveying section (31) being disposed below the 
first laundry conveyor (5) and the second upper conveying 

section (32) being disposed below the second laundry 
conveyor (6), and the lower conveying section of the  

 
further laundry conveyor extending below the two upper 

conveying sections, and wherein adjustment means (35, 36, 
37) are provided to change the course of a belt (34) of 

the lower conveying section of the further laundry 
conveyor in the area of the gap (7), or, respectively of 

the ends turned toward each other of the upper conveying 
sections (31, 32). 
A folding apparatus as set forth in claim 9, 
wherein using the adjustment means the circulatory path of 

the belts in the said area can be brought close to the 
lower front gap end defined by the first laundry conveyor 

or close to the lower rear gap end defined by the second 
laundry conveyor in order to make further transverse folds 

in the flatwork article, or can be moved away from the gap 
or, respectively, from the ends turned toward each other 

of the upper conveying sections, in order to carry the 
completely folded flatwork article out of the transverse 

folder.
