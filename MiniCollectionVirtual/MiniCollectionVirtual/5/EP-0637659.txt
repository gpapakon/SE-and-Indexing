<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method of flooring using
individual strips of the type consisting of a layer of
low-cost wooden material acting as the base for a row
of elements in top quality wood positioned one after
the other; said strips being laid in end-to-end
relationship in rows to produce a perfectly continuous
and regular pattern in which no lines of abutment of
adjacent strips in any row coincide with lines of
abutment of adjacent strips in an adjacent row.In this field of technology, strips consisting of a
layer of low-cost wood acting as the base of adjacent
rows of top quality wooden elements, have already been
produced.These conventional strips, on one hand, make it
possible to use elements of top quality wood, which are
sometimes scrapped from other production processes, for
the flooring rooms, and on the other hand, facilitate
and expedite the work of parquet flooring fitters in
that with just a few of these strips it is possible to
floor surfaces which would otherwise require the use of
an extremely high number of individual elements of
conventional sizes. Obviously the smaller the pieces of single elements
making up the layer of top quality strips of this kind,
the more advantageous this second advantage will be.Although conventional strips of this kind do give an
economical and functional advantage, they are however
heavily penalized in terms of appearance.As mentioned above, the strips used to date have always
been produced with a single low-cost woody layer as the
base for a number of adjacent rows of staggered
elements in top quality wood.The need to stagger the rows of elements on these
strips in fact makes it necessary to fit (consider for
example the case of a strip supporting three rows of
top quality wooden elements) a section of an element,
which might for example be half the normal length, at
the longitudinal ends of each element, between the two
standard length elements.When the two elements are laid consecutively, the end
section of an element is placed in an aligned and
consecutive position with respect to the correspoding
element section of the other element; in this way the
two sections create an element having the standard
length but with a very evident unattractive transverse
cut at the centre.Patent No. DE-A-3 919 514 is quite clearly the
expression of the prior art with all the typical
problems involved.Patent DE-A-3 919 514 illustrates the modalities for
the formation of a wooden flooring consisting of
several plywood boards which act as support for a
series of top

<CLAIMS>
A method of flooring using individual strips (1) of
the type consisting of a layer of low-cost wooden

material (2) acting as the base for a row of elements
in top quality wood (3) positioned one after the other,

said strips (1) being layed in end-to-end relationship
in rows to produce a perfectly continuous and regular

pattern in which no lines of abutment of adjacent
strips in any row coincide with lines of abutment of

adjacent strips in adjacent row.
A method of flooring, according to claim 1, whereby
the above elements in top quality wood (3)supported by

said layer of low cost material (2)are all of the same
length.
A method of flooring, according to claim 1, whereby
the above elements in top quality wood (3)supported by

said layer of low cost material (2) are of two
different lengths and mounted according to a regular

layout where a longer element is always alternated with
a shorter element.
A method of flooring, according to claim 1, whereby
each consecutive pair of said elements in top quality

wood (3)supported by said layer of low cost material
(2) is arranged so that the pattern of the natural

fibres of one element is symmetric to that of the
element consecutive to the same.
