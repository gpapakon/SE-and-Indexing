<CLAIMS>
Variously positionable pivot joint having a nut 
and bolt connection, particularly for wheel guide arms 

(1) in motor vehicles, wherein a bolt (5, 5a) passes 
through two legs (13, 14) of a mounting, which lie 

opposite one another and are spaced apart, and can be 
fixed, variably in position transversely to its 

longitudinal direction relative to said legs, in at least 
two given end positions on each side of its central 

position, and wherein an oblong hole guide (7, 15, 20) 
extending in the direction of the adjustment is provided 

in at least one of the legs to receive the bolt, characterized 
in that the oblong hole guide (7, 15, 20) has, 

starting from its end faces, snugs (8, 21) which extend 
towards the centre and the backs of which form a guide 

corresponding to the central position of the bolt, and in 
that, for the purpose of fastening the bolt (5, 5a) in an 

end position different from the central position, a notch 
(9) receiving the respective snug is provided on the bolt 

and for the purpose of support in the opposite direction 
a stop (19) engaging in the oblong hole (7) is provided. 
Variously positionable pivot joint according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the stop is associated 

with a shim (17) having a guide bore (18) for the bolt. 
Variously positionable pivot joint according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that the stop is in the form of 

a shaped projection (19) on the shim (17). 
Variously positionable pivot joint according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that an oblong hole guide (7) 

having centring snugs (8) is associated with the mounting 
leg on the nut side.  

 
Variously positionable pivot joint according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that an oblong hole guide 

having centring snugs (8) is associated with each leg 
(13, 14) of the mounting. 
Variously positionable pivot joint according to 
Claim 5, characterized in that notches (9, 16) provided 

on the bolt and corresponding to the snugs of the oblong 
hole guides (15) of both legs (13, 13) of the mounting 

are associated with the head and nut regions of the bolt.
