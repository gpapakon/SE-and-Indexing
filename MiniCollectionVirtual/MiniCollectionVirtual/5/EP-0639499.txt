<ABSTRACT>
Servo control device for actuating a flight control member of an aircraft, including at least one hydraulic jack (1), as well as means of actuating this jack, this hydraulic jack (1) being a double-action jack (1), these actuation means including a first and a second actuation assemblies comprising two hydraulic circuits each controlled by a mechanically controlled distribution valve (V1 to V4), these two distribution valves being actuated by common mechanical elements (A, B) driven in movement by motor means (M1 to M4), the actuation means including management means (U1 to U4) controlling these motor means (M1 to M4) on the basis of the position of the flight control member and of the piloting commands which it receives, means (D1, D2, D3, D4) for detecting failures, and a selection valve (13) which controls the changing of the actuation assemblies from the active state to the reserve state.

A servo-control system for actuating an aircraft flight control 

member, the system comprising at least one hydraulic actuator (1) 
mounted between said member and another portion of the aircraft, 

together with actuator means for actuating said actuator, said 
hydraulic actuator (1) being a duplicated actuator (1), said 

actuation means including a first actuation assembly (U1, M1, V1, 
T11, T12; U3, M3, V3, T31, T32) comprising two hydraulic circuits 

each controlled by a mechanically-controlled distributor valve (V1, 
V3), said two distributor valves being actuated by common mechanical 

elements (A) caused to move by motor means (M1, M3), the actuation 
means including control means (U1, U3) controlling said motor means 

(M1, M3) as a function of the position of the flight control member 
and of the piloting orders it receives, the system being 

characterized in that it includes a second actuation assembly (U2, 
M2, V2, T21, T22; U4, M4, V4, T41, T42) of the above-specified type 

in which the distributor valves are actuated simultaneously with 
those of the first assembly and in a manner similar thereto, and in 

that it also includes means (D1, D2, D3, D4) for detecting the 
failure of at least one element of one or the other of said first and 

second actuation assemblies, together with a selector valve (13) 
having two states, said selector valve (13) selectively putting the 

hydraulic circuits (T11, T12; T21, T22; T31, T32, T41, T42) of the 
first and second actuation assemblies into communication with the 

hydraulic circuits of the actuator, such that in a first state of the 
selector valve (13) the first actuation assembly is active and 

controls the actuator (1), the second actuation assembly being in 
reserve, and in a second state of the selector valve (13) the first 

and second actuation assemblies are respectively in reserve and 
active, said selector valve (13) being switched from one of its 

states to the other under the control of the control means (U1, U2, 
U3, U4) as a function of any failure(s) detected by the detection 

means (D1, D2, D3, D4). 
A system according to claim 1, characterized in that each of the 
first and second actuation assemblies includes two drive units (U1, 

M1; U3, M3) (U2, M2; U4, M4) capable of driving the common mechanical  
 

elements (A, B) actuating their distributor valves (V1, V2, V3, V4); 
in operation, one of the two drive units in a single actuation 

assembly is operational while the other one is passive, the control 
means acting simultaneously with the selector valve (13) being caused 

to change over from one of its states to the other, to cause the 
operational drive unit in that one of the actuation assemblies that 

was active and that is being put into reserve to change over to the 
passive state, and also causing the other drive unit of said 

actuation assembly to change over from the passive state to the 
operational state. 
A system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the 
detection means (D1, D2, D3, D4) include means for detecting a 

failure to operate in a mechanically-controlled valve. 
A system according to claim 3, characterized in that said means 
comprise means for comparing the operation of the two valves in the 

same actuation assembly. 
A system according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the detection means (D1, D2, D3, D4) include means for detecting 

a failure of the motor means or of the connection between the control 
means and said motor means. 
A system according to claim 5, characterized in that said means 
include comparator means for comparing the operation of the valves 

actuated by said motor means with the orders delivered thereto by 
said control means. 
A system according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 
the detection means (D1, D2, D3, D4) include means for detecting 

failures in the mechanical connections between the motor means and 
the mechanically-controlled valves. 
A system according to any preceding claim, characterized in that 
it includes means for detecting a failure in the operation of the 

control means.  
 
A system according to any preceding claim, characterized in that a 
mechanically-controlled distributor valve (V1, V2, V3, V4) is a valve 

of the slider type, the detector means including means (D1, D2, D3, 
D4) for detecting displacement of the internal member of said valve 

within the body thereof, the latter means including a ferromagnetic 
core carried by said internal member, associated with coils through 

which said core passes when the internal member moves. 
A use of a servo-control system according to any preceding claim 
for controlling the pitch orientation of a blade of an aircraft 

rotor, in particular of a helicopter rotor.
