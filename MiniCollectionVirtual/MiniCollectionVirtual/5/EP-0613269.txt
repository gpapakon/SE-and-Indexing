<ABSTRACT>
A computer forms a node in a network, consisting of computer nodes 
linked together into a minimum spanning tree topology. When a computer 

receives a message from a first node linked to it, it forwards the 
message to other nodes linked to that computer, as well as storing 

information about the message. As replies are received from the other 
computers, they are stored and collated together, to allow the computer 

to send just a single reply message back to the originating node based 
on the collated replies. This single reply is in turn collated at the 

next node. The message requests deletion of a particular node from the 
network. No node deletes the node from the network until replies have 

been received from all the nodes to which the message was forwarded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of operating a computer 
forming a node in a network, the network consisting of a plurality of 
computer nodes linked together. Over the past few years it has become increasingly common to 
connect personal computers or workstations together into networks so 
that different machines can communicate with one another. A typical 
approach has been the introduction of local area networks (LANs) that 
provide file transfer and other facilities between computers. Other 
types of link, for example Intergrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), 
are also known. Such networks offer the possibility of new forms of 
application for the user - for example EPA 475581 describes a 
collaborative working environment in which users at two or more 
different machines work simultaneously and in combination on a single 
program (for example a spreadsheet). Another possibility is to provide 
video-conferencing, using personal computers equipped with multimedia 
video display adapter cards. In order to achieve maximum flexibility and usefulness, such 
collaborative working and multimedia applications place great demands on 
the communications subsystem used. Likewise, the network must be able to 
use more than one physical network - for instance, workstations on a LAN 
in one location can be connected with another LAN over an ISDN line 
(note that we are using "network" here by itself to imply a logical 
collection of nodes communicating with one another, rather than a 
hardwired physical network). The provision of such a network environment poses many technical 
problems, such as how to assign a terminal a unique name, so that other 
terminals in the network can identify it. Because the network can be 
heterogeneous (based on more than one type of physical connection and 
computer), it is not possible to use identifiers based on particular 
hardware systems (eg a telephone number as in ISDN, or LAN card  
 
identifiers as in a LAN). US 4914571 describes a method for locating a 
named resource in a network. This technique can be adapted to obtain an 
identifier. The resource requested can represent the intended 
identifier: if no node in the network has knowledge of this resource, 
then the identifier must be available, if not, then a new identifier 
must be selected. However, US 4914571 does not address other difficulties arising 
from the dynamic nature of the network, such as the need for mechanisms 
whereby terminals can join or depart from the network in an orderly 
fashion. Of

A method of operating a computer forming a node in a network, said 
network consisting of a plurality of nodes linked together in a minimum 

spanning tree topology wherein each node maintains information 
concerning the configuration of the network, the method comprising the 

steps of: 
   receiving a message from a first node linked to said computer 

commanding the computer to delete a specified node from the network; 
   storing information identifying the message; 

   forwarding the message to other nodes linked to said computer; 
   receiving replies to the message from said other nodes; 

   collating the replies received from said other nodes with the 
stored information to generate a single reply, and dependent on the 

contents of said replies, deleting the specified node from the netork by 
updating the configuration information; 

   sending the single reply to said first node. 
A computer workstation adapted to form a node in a network, said 
network consisting of a plurality of nodes linked together in a minimum 

spanning tree topology, wherein each node maintains information 
concerning the configuration of the network, the workstation comprising: 

   means for receiving a message from a first node linked to said 
computer commanding the computer to delete a specified node from the 

network; 
   means for storing information identifying the message; 

   means for forwarding the message to other nodes linked to said 
computer; 

   means for receiving replies to the message from said other nodes; 
   means for collating the replies received from said other nodes 

with the stored information to generate a single reply, and dependent on 
the contents of said replies, deleting the specified node from the 

network by updating the configuration information; 
   means for sending the single reply to said first node.
