<ABSTRACT>
Converter with a control circuit fed from the input and from a feed-back loop. In order, in the event of malfunction of an arrangement for regulating the output voltage, to limit the output voltage with the least possible expenditure, the arrangement for regulating the output voltage and a voltage-limiting arrangement connected to the supply input of the control circuit are linked with their outputs in the manner of an OR-circuit. The converter is particularly suitable for conversion with comparatively large input voltages.

is arranged in series with a primary winding (41) of a 

transformer (4) and can be controlled by a control 
circuit (6), having at least one secondary circuit, which 

is connected to an output winding (42) of the transformer,
