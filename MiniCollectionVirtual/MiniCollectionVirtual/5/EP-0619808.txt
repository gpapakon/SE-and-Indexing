<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one
chelating agents of therapeutic value, the compounds being of
particular value in the treatment of conditions in which there is a
toxic concentration of a metal, for example iron, in the body.UK Patent No. 2 136 807 and various scientific papers describe
the use of 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones for the treatment of iron
overload arising from various causes, particularly that arising
from pathological conditions such as thalassaemia, sickle cell
anaemia, aplastic anaemia, and idiopathic haemochromatosis, often
through the treatment of the first three conditions by regular
blood transfusions. Moreover, in addition to use for the treatment
of general iron overload, the 3-hydroxpyridin-4-ones are of
interest for use in certain pathological conditions where there may
be an excess of iron deposited at certain sites even though the
patient does not exhibit a general iron overload, this being the
case, for example, in certain arthritic and cancerous conditions.Although the major use described in the literature for these
compounds is in the removal of iron, they are also of potential
interest for the removal of other metals present in the body in
deleterious amounts, for example copper, plutonium and other
related transuranic metals, and especially aluminium.The 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones are also of interest for use in
certain other contexts. Thus the free 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones have
been proposed for use in the treatment of inflammatory and
atherosclerotic disease, of neoplastic disease, and as platelet
anti-aggregatory agents with a role in the treatment of thrombosis.
They are also of interest in various areas where chelating agents
can be of value, for example in the treatment of paraquat poisoning.We have now found that a small group of 3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones
falling within the scope of UK Patent No. 2 136 807 but not
specifically disclosed therein has properties which render these
3-hydroxypyridin-4-ones particularly suitable for use in the
treatment of iron overload. Accordingly the present invention comprises a compound being a
3-hydroxypyridin-4-one of formula (I)

in which R1 is a methyl, ethyl, 2-(α-methylpropionyloxy)ethyl or
2-pivaloyloxyethyl group and R2, R3 and R4 are each separately
selected from hydrogen and methyl, ethyl, 2-(α-methylpropionyloxy)ethyl
and 2-pivaloyloxyethyl groups with the provisos that (a) one
only of R1 to R4 is either a 2-(α-methylpropionyloxy)ethyl group or
a 2-pivaloyloxyethyl group, (b) at least one of R2 and R3 is other
