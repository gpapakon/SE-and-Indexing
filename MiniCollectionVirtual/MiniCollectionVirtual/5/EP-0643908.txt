<ABSTRACT>
An implement for milking animals comprises a 
milking parlour, a robot arm (6) with a robot arm end portion 

(34) carrying teat cups (45 to 48) and extending in a 
substantially horizontal plane, and a vertically directed 

frame beam along which the robot arm is movable up- and 
downwards. Further, sensor means (51) are provided which are 

able to determine the position of the animal's teats, by 
means of which sensor means (51) the teat cups can be applied 

to said teats. To protect the robot arm (6), deflecting means 
are provided to render said robot arm end portion (34) to 

move downwardly when e.g. an animal kicks against it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement
such as disclosed in EP-A-300582,
for
milking animals, according to the preamble of claim 1.Such an implement is known from GB-A-2007486. In
suchlike implements, it may occur that the robot arm is
charged to much, e.g. when an animal kicks against it, so
that the robot arm can be damaged.In order to overcome this disadvantage, the
implement, as described in the opening paragraph, is characterized
by the features of claim 1.A milking implement with deflecting means to render
a robot arm end portion to change its position is known per
se from FR-A-2595197. In the implement in said document,
separate robot arm end portions extending in different directions
are present, each thereof carrying a teat cup, while
the deflecting means are constituted by a springlike element
taken into each of said robotarm end portions.According to
a particular embodiment of
the invention, the deflecting means 
comprise a pivoting element between two robot arm portions,
while a springlike element is provided acting against a force
exerted on the robot arm end portion in the downward direction.
In order to realize a slight tilting of the robot arm
end portion during the movement provoked by the deflecting
means, in the operative position of the robot arm end portion
under the animal, the deflecting means are located outside
the milking parlour.In a favourable construction, additional deflecting means
are able to control
the relevant robot arm portions. In that case, the robot arm
may be controlled by means of operating cylinders which
render the respective robot arm portions to move in a
substantially horizontal plane when e.g. an animal kicks
against them. Also, the robot arm may be controlled by means
of a further operating cylinder which renders the robot arm
to move downwardly when e.g. an animal kicks against it. The
operating cylinders may be constituted by pneumatically
operable cylinders or hydraulically and/or electromagnetically
operable cylinders having an overload protection.For a better understanding of the present invention
and to show how the same may be carried into effect,
reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a side view of a robot arm arranged at
the side of a milking parlour;Figure 2 is a plan view of the robot arm;Figure 3 is a side view of part of the robot arm
as shown in Figure 2;Figure 4 is a plan view of the end of the robot
arm;Figure 5 is a side view of the robot arm end as
shown in Figure

<CLAIMS>
An implement for milking animals, such as cows,
comprising a milking parlour, a robot arm (6) carrying

teat cups (45 to 48) and extending in a substantially
horizontal plane,

coupling means (50) for applying each teat cup to a relevant
teat of the animal's udder,

a vertically directed frame beam along
which the robot arm is movable up- and downwards, and sensor

means (51) able to determine the position of the animal's
teats, as well as control means (56, 18, 22, 36, 40, 80 to 83)

for conveying, on the basis of the teat position as determined by the sensor means
(51), the robot arm in such a position under the animal's udder that a teat cup (45 to

48) can be applied to the relevant teat,
characterized in that the robot arm

(6) comprises a robot arm end portion (34), carrying the teat
cups (45 to 48),

and a further portion,
while deflecting means are provided to

render said robot arm end portion (34) to move downwardly
relative to the further portion, when e.g. an animal kicks against it. 
An implement as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the deflecting means comprise a pivoting element (30)

between two robot arm portions (28, 32) and a springlike
element (29) acting against a force exerted on the robot arm

end portion (34) in the downward direction.
An implement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that, in the operative position of the robot arm

end portion (34) under the animal, the deflecting means are
located outside the milking parlour.
An implement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the additional deflecting means are able to control

the relevant robot arm portions (32 to 34).
An implement as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 4, characterized
in that the robot arm (6) is controlled by means of

operating cylinders (26, 36) which render the respective
robot arm portions (28, 32 to 34) to move in a substantially

horizontal plane when e.g. an animal kicks against them.
An implement as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2,
4 or 5, characterized in that the robot arm (6) is controlled

by means of a further operating cylinder (22) which renders
the robot arm (6) to move downwardly when e.g. an animal

kicks against it.
An implement as claimed in claims 5 or 6, characterized
in that the operating cylinders are pneumatically 

operable cylinders.
An implement as claimed in claim 5 or 6, characterized
in that the operating cylinders are hydraulically

and/or electromagnetically operable cylinders having an
overload protection.
