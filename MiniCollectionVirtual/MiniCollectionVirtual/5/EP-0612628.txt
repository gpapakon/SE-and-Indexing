<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermosensitive 
recording material, and more particularly to a thermosensitive 
recording material capable of producing images 
with excellent preservation stability, comprising as the 
main components a leuco dye serving as a coloring agent 
and a color developer capable of inducing color formation 
in the leuco dye upon application of heat thereto. There are conventionally proposed various recording 
materials which utilize the coloring reaction between a 
colorless or light-colored electron donor type dye such 
as a leuco dye and a color developer capable of inducing 
color formation in the leuco dye upon application of heat 
or pressure thereto when brought into contact with the 
leuco dye. A thermosensitive recording material, one of the 
above-mentioned recording materials, is proposed as 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publications 43-4160 and 45-14039  
 
and Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application 48-27736. 
Such a thermosensitive recording material is usable as a 
recording material for an electronic computer, facsimile 
apparatus, ticket vending apparatus, label printer, and 
recorder because it has the advantages that complicated 
processes such as development and image-fixing are not 
required, recording can be achieved for a short period of 
time using a relatively simple apparatus, there is no 
noise development, and the manufacturing cost is low. In such a thermosensitive recording material, 
colorless or light-colored leuco dyes having a lactone, 
lactam, or a spiropyran ring are used as coloring dyes, 
and organic acids or phenols are conventionally employed 
as color developers. The thermosensitive recording 
material using the above-mentioned leuco dye and color 
developer is widely used for practical use because the 
produced images have high image density, with the 
whiteness of the background maintained high. In line with the increase of a demand for the 
thermosensitive recording system, the requirements for 
improved preservability of the images recorded on the 
thermosensitive recording material with respect to the 
resistances to chemicals, light and heat are increased. 
Therefore, the development of a recording material 
capable of meeting the above-mentioned requirements is  
 
intensively desired. To improve the preservation stability of the 
recorded images on the thermosensitive recording 
material, it is proposed to use as the color developer 
with high reliability a phenolsulfonic acid compound, as 
disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent
