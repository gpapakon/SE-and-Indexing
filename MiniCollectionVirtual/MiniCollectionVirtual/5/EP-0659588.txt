<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing a card, comprising the steps of:

 
   a first step (A) of photographing objects and 

storing photographed objects as image data;
 

   a second step (B) of storing object data associated 
with the objects;

 
   a third step (C) or reading out desired image data 

from the image data and part of the object data 
corresponding to the desired image data, and 

synthesizing the desired image data and the part of the 
object data;

 
   a fourth step (D) of printing out the synthesized 

data of the image and the object data on a lower 
surface of a transparent sheet (124), and

 
   a fifth step (E) of stacking the printed transparent 

sheet (124) on a card body (131) incorporating a data 
storage medium (130) and drawn with a common card 

pattern, and synthesizing the image and object data 
printed on the transparent sheet with the common card 

pattern drawn on the card body (131).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
manufacturing a card and, more particularly, to a method
of manufacturing a card such as an IC card with a
photograph.An employee's portrait is adhered to an IC card
with a photograph used for managing company employees,
and employee data such as employee numbers and names are
stored in the IC card.Such an IC card is manufactured as follows. A face
of each employee is photographed on a film camera, and a
film unloaded from the camera is developed,.printed, and
enlarged. A portrait of each employee is printed on a
peelable print, and this peelable print is filed in a
photograph register.In this case, an employee number and name are also
listed together with the peelable print in the photograph
register.The above operations are performed in units of
employees.On the other hand, an employee register is separately
prepared. Data of the name, number, and date of
birth of each employee are described in this employee
register.When an IC card for a predetermined employee is to
be formed while the employees' photographs and their
name list are managed, the photograph of this employee 
is searched in the photograph register. The searched
photograph is adhered to a transparent sheet.Data such as the name, number, and date of birth of
this employee are also searched in the employee register
and are typed on another sheet serving as an IC card
base.These two sheets are transferred to a card manufacturing
process. In this process, these two sheets
overlap still another sheet, interposing an IC module
therebetween. These three sheets are heat-pressed to
obtain an IC card.The employee data such as the name, number, and the
like of this employee are written in the IC module in
the IC card by a data write-in unit.Another card manufacturing method is described
in Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application
No. 63-120696.According to this card manufacturing method, an ID
(identification) card is manufactured from laminated
plastic sheets, and a portrait embedded in the plastic
sheets.In a card in which a portrait is embedded in plastic
sheets, the portrait is separated from the plastic
sheets when the plastic sheets receive an excessive
force and are bent. Documents AU-A-73 899/87 and DE-A-36 29 767 disclose
methods similar to that described in the
precharacterizing part of claim 1.Further document EP-A-0 195 104 describes a method of
manufacturing a card wherein a photograph of a person
and data of this person are simultaneously printed on
the card.Finally, prior art
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing a card, comprising the
steps of:


a first step (A) of photographing objects and
storing photographed objects as image data;
a second step (B) of storing object data
associated with the objects; and
a third step (C) of reading out desired image
data from the image data and part of the object data

corresponding to the desired image data, and
synthesizing the desired image data and the part of

the object data;
a fourth step (D) of printing out the synthesized
data of the image and the object data on a sheet;

   characterized in that
in said fourth step said synthesized data of the
image and the object data are printed out on a lower

surface of a transparent sheet (124), and

   said method further comprises
a fifth step (E) of stacking the printed
transparent sheet (124) on a card body (131), said card body

incorporating a data storage medium (130) and

image and object data printed on the transparent
sheet with the common card pattern drawn on the card

body (131).
A method according to claim 1, characterized by
further comprising: 


a sixth step (F) of storing the object data in
the data storage medium (130) incor
porated in the
card body (131).
