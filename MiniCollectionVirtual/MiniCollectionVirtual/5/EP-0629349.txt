<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of 
a 20⁺ cheese or cheese product. A product resembling low-fat 

milk is added to cheese milk. This product resembling low-fat 
milk has been obtained from a whey protein concentrate of a 

protein content of 25-50%, based on the solids, and a pH value 
of 5.9-6.7. Calcium ions have been added to this concentrate, 

whereafter it has been subjected to a heat treatment and a 
homogenization. Further, the mixed culture APS₁₃ is added. 

Then, in conventional manner, a fresh cheese is prepared, 
which, after brining, is subjected to a conventional ripening. 

In the process of the invention, the product resembling 
low-fat milk is added to the cheese milk in an amount of 

0.2-2 wt.%, based on the cheese milk, and the cheese milk is 
standardised in such a manner that a cheese or cheese product 

of a fat content of between 20 and 25%, based on the solids, 
is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a half-hard cheese or a half-hard 
cheese product with a low fat content. More specifically, 
the invention relates to a so-called 20+ cheese or 20+ cheese 
product. The designation "20+" is used to indicate that the 
finished cheese or the finished cheese product has a fat 
content of between 20 and 25%, based on the dry matter. It is generally known (see for instance Dr. Heinrich 
Mair-Waldburg, Handbuch der Käse, (1974), 
Volkswirtschaftlicher Verlag GmbH, Kempten (Allgäu), Germany, 
in particular page 73) that the fat fraction in cheese plays 
an essential role in both the taste sensation and the 
consistency of cheese. When cheese has only a low fat content, 
problems regarding flavour as well as consistency arise. However, consumers increasingly appreciate products with 
a low fat content. Accordingly, there is a need for a cheese or a cheese 
product that contains relatively little fat and yet has a good 
flavour and the desired consistency. Abrahamsen has described processes for cheesemaking from 
milk fortified with ultrafiltrated whey protein concentrate 
(WPC) in Milchwissenschaft 34, No. 2 (1979) 65-68. One of 
these processes leads to a low fat cheese of the Gouda type. 
This cheese was prepared using a WPC containing 19% solids and 
11.2% proteins, which was heat treated at 85°C for 10 minutes 
and mixed with the milk in portions of 5-10%. In another 
process, addition of 6% WPC (with a solids content of 11.3% 
and a protein content of 5.45%) to the milk resulted in cheese 
with 20% fat in the solids. As to the ripening of these low fat rennet cheeses the 
article indicates that a slower proteolysis in cheese from 
milk fortified with WPC is obtained as compared with cheeses  
 
from normal milk. As the skilled man knows, proteolysis is 
responsible for the consistency and flavour of a cheese. European patent application 0 427 307 discloses a process 
for the preparation of low fat dairy products by aggregation 
of casein in milk, with a part of the milk fat being replaced 
with hydrated, denatured protein particles of an average 
particle size of between 0.1 and 40 µm. When a half-hard 
cheese is prepared, protein particles, and in particular whey 
protein particles, of an average particle size of 2-20 µm are 
used. The whey protein particles used are prepared by heating 
a solution of non-denatured whey proteins at a concentration 
below the gelation concentration to at least the 
pasteurization temperature. A part of the whey proteins is 
thus denatured by heat

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of a cheese or cheese 
product, comprising the steps of adding a product resembling 

low-fat milk to cheese milk in an amount of 0.2-2 wt.%, based 
on the dried solids and drawn to the cheese milk, the cheese 

milk being standardized in such a manner that a cheese or 
cheese product of a fat content of between 20 and 25% based on 

the solids, is obtained, said product resembling low-fat milk 
having been obtained from a whey protein concentrate of a 

protein content of 25-50%, based on the solids, and a pH value 
of 5.9-6.7, calcium ions having been added to this concentrate, 

whereafter this concentrate has been subjected to a heat 
treatment and a homogenization, adding a mesophilic starter 

culture together with a mixed culture APS
13
, being a mixture of 
thermophilic acid bacteria, which has been deposited under 

No. CBS 483.86, to the cheese milk, coagulating the milk and 
treating the obtained curd in a conventional manner for the 

preparation of a half-hard cheese product, which, after 
brining, is subjected to a ripening. 
A process according to claim 1, wherein the cheese is 
subjected to the following ripening process: 


3-5 weeks at a temperature between 12 and 15°C; 
4-6 weeks at a temperature between 18 and 20°C; and finally 
1-3 weeks at a temperature between 12 and 15°C. 
A process according to claim 2, wherein the first and 
third ripening steps are carried out at 14°C. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the ripening process lasts 11-12 weeks. 
A process according to any one of the preceding claims, 
wherein the cheese milk is priorly subjected to bactofugation 

to prevent butyric acid fermentation. 
A process according to any one of claims 1-4, wherein 
lysozyme is added to the cheese milk to prevent butyric acid 

fermentation. 
A cheese or cheese product obtainable by the use of the 
process according to any one of claims 1-6.
