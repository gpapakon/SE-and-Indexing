<ABSTRACT>
In a hook structure for a molded surface fastener, each 
of hooks (10) is composed of a rising portion (11), which has a 

rear surface (11a) rising obliquely in a smooth curve from the 
substrate (14), a front surface (11b) rising upwardly from the 

substrate (14), and side surfaces from at least one of which 
a reinforcing rib (13) extends, and a hook-shape engaging portion 

(12) extending forwardly from an upper end of the rising 
portion (11). The engaging portion (12) has a varying cross-sectional 

area increasing progressively from its distal end 
toward the upper end of the rising portion (11). A straight 

line between a peak of the rib (13) and a peak (O₁) of an arcuate 
lower surface of the engaging portion (12) is substantially 

parallel to the upper surface of the substrate. The rib (13) 
is rising upwardly and substantially centrally from a side 

surface of base of each hook (10). A straight line passing a 
center point (O₂) in height of the rib (13) and parallel to 

the surface of the substrate (14) crosses a ridge of the rib 
(13) and a ridge of the rising portion (11) of each hook (10) 

in such a manner that the ratio of a line segment of the straight 
line between the crossing points with the ridge of the rib (13) 

to a line segment of the straight line between crossing points 
with the ridge of the rising portion (11) is 1/5 to 1/2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an engaging member, for a
surface fastener, in which a plate-like substrate and a
multiplicity of hooks are molded of thermoplastic resin by
extrusion or injection molding, and more particularly to a
hook structure which has both flexibility and toughness
like a monofilament though molded and is very durable.A hooked surface fastener has been known long since
in which hooks are formed by cutting loops of monofilaments
woven into a woven cloth. With this type of surface fastener,
flexibility of the woven cloth and flexibility of the monofilaments
combine to make a very smooth touch when the hooks
come into and out of engagement with loops of the companion
fastener member. Additionally, since the monofilaments
forming hooks are treated with drawing process, they are
excellent in toughness against pulling and bending though
small in cross-sectional area. Further, since the hooks can
be formed in high density depending on the structure of the
woven cloth, this type of surface fastener has a high engaging
rate and hence can survive in repeated use. However, with 
this woven-cloth-type surface fastener, since the hooks tend
to deform as they give a very smooth touch during engaging
and peeling, there is a limit in engaging strength. Further,
partly since the quantity of material is large and partly
since a large number of process steps are required, it is
difficult to reduce the cost of production.To this end, an alternative molded surface fastener
has been developed in which the substrate and the hooks are
simultaneously and integrally molded by extrusion molding.
The molding technology for this type surface fastener is
disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,312,583 and WO
87/06522. In this molding method, a number of mold discs,
each of which has a number of hook-forming cavities in its
peripheral side surfaces, and a number of spacer discs, each
of which has opposite flat side surfaces, are fixedly arranged
alternately in a laminate drum. Hooks, which have been molded
in cavities in the peripheral surface of the rotating drum
integrally with a plate-like substrate, are removed, together
with the substrate, from the peripheral surface of the drum.
The reason why the spacer discs must be used in the prior art
is that the whole contour of the individual hooks could not
have been made in a single mold.However, with the prior art integrally molded surface
fastener, because of technological difficulty in molding
process, it is impossible to obtain a delicate shape like 
the woven
