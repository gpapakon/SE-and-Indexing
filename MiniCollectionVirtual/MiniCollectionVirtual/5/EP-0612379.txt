<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an alarm system suitable for use in warning of overheating in rotatable bearings (4) having first and second bearing portions. The alarm system comprises an alarm signal generator means having a thermally activated engagement element (8) on a first bearing portion or body (6) connected thereto. The element (8) is in thermal connection with the bearing (4) and is formed and arranged so as to be driven generally axially of the rotatable bearing from a first primed retracted position into a second deployed extended alarm position upon reaching a predetermined temperature. In the alarm position the element (8) contacts an engaging portion (12) on the second bearing portion so as to produce a distinctive alarm signal indicating that said bearing (4) has exceeded the predetermined temperature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rotatable bearing with an alarm system 
suitable for use with rollers and other rotary 
mechanisms having relatively rotatable parts with the 
bearing therebetween. The invention relates particularly to a device which 
gives an indication that a bearing is overheating and 
thereby gives an early indication of possible bearing 
failure. When a bearing is contaminated by dirt or 
moisture and/or is rotated with insufficient lubricant 
or an excess or lubricant and/or is overloaded, the 
bearing temperature generally increases progressively 
until eventually it is well above the normal working 
temperature of the bearing. Such increases in 
temperature are generally a symptom of impending bearing 
collapse or seizure which may cause damage to other 
components in a machine. Furthermore as a bearing 
overheats it may reach a temperature whereby it ignites 
surrounding material and it is therefore highly 
desirable to obtain early warning of such problems. Conventional monitoring of rollers bearings by 
maintenance personnel or by instrumentation has 
generally been found to be either impractical or 
prohibitively expensive. It has previously been proposed (GB-A-2 155 678) to 
utilize a thermal release device which trips when the 
temperature exceeds a control temperature, and whose 
position is sensed by a sensing means which transmits a 
signal to a central monitoring unit. In this case 
though the thermal release device is mounted radially of 
the bearing. This presents considerable practical 
difficulties in relation to installation in many  
 
situations such as in conveyor rollers and further 
substantial difficulties in relation to monitoring of 
the tripping of the device since the annular zone around 
the bearing and thermal release device is often 
obstructed in one way or another in such situations e.g. 
by the outer roller casing, conveyor belt supported 
thereby, bulk material carried on the belt etc. 
It is an object of the present invention to avoid or 
minimise one or more of the above disadvantages. The present invention provides a rotatable bearing with 
an alarm system suitable for use in warning of 
overheating in the rotatable bearing and comprising 
first and second bearing portions, said alarm system 
comprising an alarm signal generator means having a 
thermally activated engagement element provided on at 
least one of said first bearing portion and a body 
connected thereto so as to be in thermal connection with 
said bearing portion and provided
