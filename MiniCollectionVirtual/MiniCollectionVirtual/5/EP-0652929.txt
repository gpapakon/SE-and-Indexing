<ABSTRACT>
Proposed are homogeneous electroviscous liquids containing or consisting of aluminium soaps made from the reaction products of one or more polycarboxylic acids, or their anhydrides or half-esters, with reactive aluminium compounds. Such liquids exhibit a high electro-rheological effect and are completely homogenous.
