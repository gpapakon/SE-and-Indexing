<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for ejecting the ions in an ion
trap mass spectrometer.Mass spectrometers are used to determine the chemical identity of substances by
determining the mass of ions derived from the substances. The mass of an ion is
determined by using the known behavior of charged particles in electric and magnetic
fields, with some characteristic of the ion trajectory being observed and used to deduce
the mass-to-charge ratio of the ion. Mass spectrometers may be divided into two broad
classes: instruments that produce a beam of ions to effect mass analysis (such as
magnetic sector spectrometers and quadrupole spectrometers) and instruments that trap
a population of ions to effect mass analysis (such as ion cyclotron resonance mass
spectrometers and Paul ion trap mass spectrometers).The various types of mass spectrometers have advantages and disadvantages, and
a large variety of instruments are now commercially available. No one type of instrument
can deliver the necessary performance in all types of applications at an acceptable
cost, and vigorous competition exists between the manufacturers of the various types
of instruments to increase performance while controlling cost.One disadvantage of trap-type mass spectrometers, either the Paul ion trap mass
spectrometer or the ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (ICR), is that the
presence of the population of ions necessarily perturbs the electric field experienced by
the ions, so that the ion trajectories depend on the number of ions present. This results
in inaccuracy in the determination of m/z, because the field perturbation is quite
complex, and the number of ions may change during mass analysis. The "space charge"
introduced by the ions limits the number of ions that may be present during mass
analysis if mass accuracy (and mass resolution) are to be maintained. For the Paul ion 
trap mass spectrometer, the practical effect of space charge is that the dynamic range
(for purposes of mass analysis) is limited to about two orders of magnitude, because the
more abundant ions "fill" the trap before the population of non-abundant ions is great
enough to be detected with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio.This limitation is most severe in those applications where the amount of analyte
varies widely and unpredictably, such as in the gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric
investigation of samples encountered in environmental analysis. Because of the costly
high-field electromagnets needed for ion cyclotron resonance
