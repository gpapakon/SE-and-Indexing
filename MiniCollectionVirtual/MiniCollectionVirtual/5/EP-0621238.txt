<ABSTRACT>
In a small unit for producing deionised water at a volumetric rate of about 20 m
<
3
>
/week, preferably less than 5 m
<

>
/week, which has at least one resin-filled cation exchanger vessel and a resin-filled anion exchanger vessel, a device for regenerating the cation exchanger resin with an acid and the anion exchanger resin with an alkali solution being provided, the device for regenerating the ion exchanger resin (36, 42) contains an electrolysis cell (3) in which, by electrolytic cleavage of salt brine (17), the acid (19) and alkali solution (18) required for the regeneration can be produced simultaneously. This provides a regenerable deionization unit for small requirements, in which the required regenerants can be produced on site in a closed system with simple technical means, the lowest possible control expenditure and in an inexpensive manner.
