<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electrographic 
materials, particularly charge control agents, and 
toners and developers incorporating those agents. This 
invention more particularly relates to N-(carbonyl,carbonimidoyl,carbonothioyl)sulfonamide 
charge control agents and toners and developers 
including those agents. In electrography, image charge patterns are 
formed on a support and are developed by treatment with 
an electrographic developer containing marking 
particles which are attracted to the charge patterns. 
These particles are called toner particles or, 
collectively, toner. Two major types of developers, 
dry and liquid, are employed in the development of the 
charge patterns. In electrostatography, the image charge 
pattern, also referred to as an electrostatic latent 
image; is formed on an insulative surface of an 
electrostatographic element by any of a variety of 
methods. For example, the electrostatic latent image 
may be formed electrophotographically, by imagewise 
photo-induced dissipation of the strength of portions 
of an electrostatic field of uniform strength 
previously formed on the surface of an 
electrophotographic element comprising a 
photoconductive layer and an electrically conductive 
substrate. Alternatively, the electrostatic latent 
image may be formed by direct electrical formation of 
an electrostatic field pattern on a surface of a 
dielectric material. One well-known type of electrostatographic 
developer comprises a dry mixture of toner particles 
and carrier particles. Developers of this type are 
employed in cascade and magnetic brush  
 
electrostatographic development processes. The toner 
particles and carrier particles differ 
triboelectrically, such that during mixing to form the 
developer, the toner particles acquire a charge of one 
polarity and the carrier particles acquire a charge of 
the opposite polarity. The opposite charges cause the 
toner particles to cling to the carrier particles. 
During development, the electrostatic forces of the 
latent image, sometimes in combination with an 
additional applied field, attract the toner particles. 
The toner particles are pulled away from the carrier 
particles and become electrostatically attached, in 
imagewise relation, to the latent image bearing 
surface. The resultant toner image can then be fixed, 
by application of heat or other known methods, 
depending upon the nature of the toner image and the 
surface, or can be transferred to another surface and 
then fixed. Toner particles often include charge
