<ABSTRACT>
Folded paperboard food cartons having a barrier polymer coating only on the 
interior surface and sales graphics on a substantially unplasticized clay coated 

exterior surface are heat sealed at contiguous areas of overlapping flaps (14; 15, 
22; 13, 23) wherein the polymer coated interior surface (22, 23) is in direct contact 

with a small portion (71, 72) of the clay coated exterior surface or where it is 
desired to secure together two portions (14) of the clay coated exterior surface. In 

such heat sealing areas, small and accurately located exterior clay coated carton 
surface areas (71, 72) are printed with a patterned solvent based polymer material 

that is precisely applied to such areas by a printing press.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to paperboard food packages.
More particularly, the invention relates to a process for heat
sealing paperboard food packages and the packages produced by the
process.One or two serving portions of precooked and/or frozen food
are frequently packaged for consumer distribution in paperboard
trays. Such trays are folded from preprinted and die-cut paper-board
blanks.Lids for these paperboard trays may take one of several forms
including a lid that is an integral continuation of the same
paperboard blank from which the tray is erected, such a lid flap
being crease hinged to one sidewall of the tray. Another type of
lid is an independent paperboard blank that is adhesively secured
or plastic fuse bonded to a small perimeter flange folded from the
upper edge of the tray sidewalls.To protect the food contacting surfaces of the paperboard tray
and lid from moisture penetration, the internal surfaces are coated
with one or more continuous films of extruded thermoplastic. This
internal moisture barrier is applied as a free-flowing curtain to
the paperboard while still in the continuous web form and, prior to
printing and cutting the paperboard into blanks. Low-density
polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) are merely three of the more popular thermoplastic
polymers used for this purpose.However, if the paperboard blanks have closures which require
the bonding of a polymer coated interior surface to a non-polymer 
coated exterior surface, it may be necessary to also coat the
exterior of the tray and lid with an external coating of polymer
for the primary function of heat sealing these surfaces to one
another.As with all conventional fourdrinier laid paper webs, bleached
paperboard is produced with a "felt side" and a "wire side." For
food packaging, the felt side is preferred for the thermoplastic
food moisture barrier. This felt side becomes the interior of a
food package formed from the paperboard. The wire side is given a
clay coating that is smoothed by calendering to provide a superior
print surface. The wire side becomes the exterior of a food
package formed from the paperboard. However, the clay coated
paperboard surface will not readily adhere to a surface having a
polymer coating. Consequently, it is difficult to secure a
reliable heat seal between an interior thermoplastic surface of a
paperboard package and the exterior clay coated surface as
described above.A specific example arises with respect to a tray having an
integrally hinged
