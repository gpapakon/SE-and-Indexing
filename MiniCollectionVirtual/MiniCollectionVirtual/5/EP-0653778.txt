<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to light sources in 
which the light-generating medium is a microwave excited 
plasma, and more specifically, to microwave excited gas 
lasers. Light sources, and in particular, gas lasers in 
which the light-emitting medium is excited into a plasma 
state by means of microwave radiation are known. 
However, existing light sources of this type use linearly 
polarised microwave radiation to excite the gaseous 
medium to a light-emitting state. In these devices, the 
light-emitting plasma tends to break down into striations 
which follow the electric vector of the exciting 
microwave field. The stronger the microwave electric 
field, the more likely are these instabilities to occur. 
The effect is particularly critical in the case of 
microwave excited gas lasers as it limits both the 
maximum power and the pulse length of the laser radiation 
which can be produced. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
improved microwave excited gaseous light sources. According to the present invention there is provided 
a light source including a gaseous medium which is 
excited to a light-emitting state by means of a microwave 
electromagnetic field, wherein the electromagnetic field 
is generated by circularly polarised microwave radiation. In a preferred form of the invention the light 
source is adapted to operate as a laser. A particular 
form of laser embodying the invention has a lasing medium 
consisting of helium with between 0.1 and 1% of xenon at 
a total pressure between 104 and 105 Pa (100 and 1000 
mbar).  
 The invention will now be described, by way of 
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in 
which, 
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are schematic representations 
in longitudinal and transverse sections of a microwave 
excited gas laser embodying the invention, and Figures 2(a) and 2(b) are schematic representations 
in longitudinal and transverse sections of a microwave 
excited light source embodying the invention. Referring to Figure 1, a microwave excited gas laser 
embodying the invention consists of a tubular excitation 
chamber 1 made of silica or other ceramic material which 
is transparent to microwave radiation. At one end 2, of 
the excitation chamber 1 is an inlet 3 for a gaseous 
lasing medium and at the other end 4 of the excitation 
chamber 1 is an outlet 5 for the gaseous lasing medium. 
The end 2 of the excitation chamber 1 is provided with a 
fully reflecting mirror 6 and the end 4 of the excitation 
chamber 1 is provided with a
