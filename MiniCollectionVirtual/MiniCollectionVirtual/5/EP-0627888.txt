<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTECTIVE MASK WITH SCARFBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field: This invention relates to articles of clothing and more particularly to a protective mask with a scarf combined therewith.State of the Art: Masks have been used in the past to protect a user's face from inclement weather. For example, U.S. Patent 4,300,240 (Edwards) discloses a closed cell neoprene mask which may be worn about the face to protect the user from adverse weather including wind, cold, rain, snow and the like.Other articles of clothing have been devised to protect the face from inclement weather. For example, U.S. Patent 766,963 (Murray) shows a muffler structure which is wrapped about the lower portion of the face. The muffler has extensions which wrap behind the head and extend forwardly for tieing a knot under the chin. U.S. Patent 731,135 (Scott) shows a neck and ear muffler preferably formed of a single piece and of a knitted fabric.Other face protecting devices have been disclosed for protecting the face for purposes other than adverse weather. For example, U.S. Patent 2,276,612 (Ellis) shows a face guard to protect infants. U.S. Patent 2,716,981 (Moore) shows a mask to protect the face of a person using a hair dryer. Similarly, U.S. Patent 4,259,748 (Miller) shows a moisture-absorbent mask for covering the face, neck and ears. Other protective masks are disclosed in U.S. Patent 1,309,783 (Slawin) , U.S. Patent 3,878,563 (Pulgin) and U.S. Patent 4,250,577 (Smith) .Masks heretofore disclosed do not teach construction of an article of clothing to effectively protect both the face and the neck suitable for use while performing physical activities including sports in an adverse weather environment including specifically a cold weather environment. 

 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An article of clothing includes a mask member which is sized and shaped to fit about the face. The mask member has an upper edge which extends along the lower part of the eye socket areas of the user and contouredly over the nose. The mask member also has a lower edge which extends under the chin and upwardly toward the upper edge on both sides of the face rearward of the eye socket areas. A scarf member is secured to the mask member along the lower edge. The scarf member is sized to extend downwardly from the lower edge substantially the height of the neck. The scarf member extends in width rearwardly about the neck on both sides of the head. Securing means are associated with the scarf member to secure the article of clothing about the head of the user and
