<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chlorination process for the preparation
of 1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane.
1,1,1-Trichlorotrifluoroethane is a valuable chemical intermediate which is
used, inter alia, in the preparation of precursors of pyrethroid
insecticides, such as cyhalothrin anf tefluthrin. Hitherto it has been
obtained by various processes including by rearrangement of the isomeric
product 1,1,2-trichlorotrifluoroethane in the presence of aluminium
halides, and by gas-phase photochemically-initiated chlorination of
non-perhalogenated precursors such as 1,1,1-trifluoroethane. However the
use of these processes is considered unsatisfactory because of low
conversion rates, difficulty in separating the product from the starting
material, and/or the formation of undesirable by-products.It has now been found that by careful selection of the conditions it
is possible to obtain 1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane by chlorination of
1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane, and the process is capable of providing a
high degree of conversion with high specificity and easy separation of the
desired product. Furthermore it is possible to adapt the process to
operate not only on a batch by batch basis but also in a semi-continuous or
continuous manner suitable for large scale manufacture of
1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane.Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the
preparation of 1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane in which
1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane is subjected to chlorination by bringing the
1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane into contact with chlorine within a reaction
vessel characterised in that the process is conducted in the liquid phase
in the presence of a chemical free radical initiator under a pressure of
from 1 to 20 bar and at a temperature within the range 50 to 120째C, and the
product is separated from the reaction mixture by fractional distillation.In the case of continuous or semi-continuous operation the reactants
are continuously fed into the reaction vessel at a rate consistent with the
steady state production of 1,1,1-trichlorotrifluoroethane and within a
preferred molar ratio of chlorine to 1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane within
the range 1.0 to 2.5. At the steady state the molar ratio of chlorine to
total chlorinatable hydrogen atoms is also preferably within the range 0.5
to 1.0.The process is conducted within a closed system with arrangements to 
admit the reactants and remove the product. Within the reaction vessel
itself the conditions of the process may be controlled by regulation of the
ra
