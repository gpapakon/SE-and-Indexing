<CLAIMS>
A method for the regeneration by electrolysis of 
waste pickle containing hydrochloric acid, iron and 

zinc salts produced upon the pickling of workpieces 
made of non-alloyed and low-alloyed steels by means of 

hydrochloric acid, wherein the Fe²⁺ ions and Zn²⁺ ions 
are metallically separated off at the cathode and are 

removed from the cathode compartment, characterised in 
that the waste pickle is fed to the cathode compartment 

of an electrolysis stage which is separated from an 
anode compartment containing sulphuric acid on both 

sides by a cation-exchanger membrane, and the Cl⁻ ions 
react with the H⁺ ions migrating from the anode 

compartments into the cathode compartment to form free 
hydrochloric acid. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the cell voltage is 2 to 12 V, preferably 4 to 

8 V, and the current density is ≧ 1 kA/m², preferably 1 
to 5 kA/m². 
A method according to Claims 1 and 2, 
characterized in that the sulphuric acid circulated 

through the anode compartments has an acid content of 
up to 5%.
