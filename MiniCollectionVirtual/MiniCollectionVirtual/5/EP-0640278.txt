<ABSTRACT>
A metering device for applying casing soil on compost 
for raising mushrooms or the like, said device being provided with a 

hopper (1) 
for accommodating casing soil supplied by transport means (32), for 

example, 
and with spreading means, whereby a shaft (7) provided with blades (13), 

which is 
rotatable about a substantially horizontal axis of rotation, is disposed 

inside the hopper (1), under an inlet opening (6) located at the upper 
side of 

the hopper, the pitch of the blades on the one part of the shaft being 
opposed to the pitch of the blades on the other part of the shaft, whilst 

a further shaft (8), which is rotatable about a substantially horizontal 
axis 

of rotation, is disposed under said shaft (7), above a trough-shaped 
bottom (3) 

of the hopper, near a substantially horizontally extending ejection 
slot (22), 

said further shaft (8) being provided with ejection means (17), by which 
the casing 

soil can be discharged from the hopper (1) via the ejection slot (22), 
whilst means (10,11,12) are provided for rotating both shafts (7,8).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a metering device for applying 
casing soil on compost for raising mushrooms or the like, said device being 
provided with a hopper for accommodating casing soil supplied by transport 
means; for example, and with spreading means. For raising mushrooms or the like it is customary to 
arrange the compost suitable for raising crops of this type in beds and 
to cover the layer of compost with a layer of casing soil. Conventional devices of this kind use spreading discs 
and pushing means, the construction of these devices is rather complicated 
and voluminous. The object of the invention is to obtain a device of 
the above kind, which is of compact and light design and by means of which 
an effective and even spreading of casing soil can be achieved, independently 
of the degree of humidity of the casing soil. According to the invention this can be achieved in that 
a shaft provided with blades, which is rotatable about a substantially 
horizontal axis of rotation, is disposed inside the hopper, under an inlet 
opening located at the upper side of the hopper, the pitch of the blades 
on the one part of the shaft being opposed to the pitch of the blades on 
the other part of the shaft, whilst a further shaft, which is rotatable 
about a substantially horizontal axis of rotation, is disposed under said 
shaft, above a trough-shaped bottom of the hopper, near a substantially 
horizontally extending ejection slot, said further shaft being provided 
with ejection means, by which the casing soil can be discharged from the 
hopper via the ejection slot, whilst means are provided for rotating both 
shafts. In this manner a simple, efficient device has been 
obtained, to which the casing soil can be supplied through the inlet 
opening, for example by means of a conveyor belt, and whereby the material 
can be discharged in an even layer through the ejection slot. The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter 
with reference to an embodiment of the construction according to the 
invention diagrammatically illustrated in the accompanying Figures. Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view of a device according 
to the invention.  Figure 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of the device 
shown in Figure 1, seen in the direction according to the arrow II. Figure 3 shows a part of a front view of the device 
shown in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 4 is a side view of a blade secured to the upper 
shaft of the device. Figure 5 is a side view of a blade secured to the lower 
shaft of the device. Figure

<CLAIMS>
A metering device for applying casing soil on compost 
for raising mushrooms or the like, said device being provided with a hopper 

for accommodating casing soil supplied by transport means, for example, 
and with spreading means, characterized in that a shaft provided with 

blades, which is rotatable about a substantially horizontal axis of 
rotation, is disposed inside the hopper, under an inlet opening located 

at the upper side of the hopper, whereby the pitch of the blades on the 
one part of the shaft is opposed to the pitch of the blades on the other 

part of the shaft, whilst a further shaft, which is rotatable about a 
substantially horizontal axis of rotation, is disposed under said shaft, 

above a trough-shaped bottom of the hopper, near a substantially horizontally 
extending ejection slot, said further shaft being provided with 

ejection means, by which the casing soil can be discharged from the hopper 
via the ejection slot, whilst means are provided for rotating both shafts. 
A metering device according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said hopper, at its side remote from said ejection slot, has a 

wall which slopes upwards from the trough-shaped bottom, and that said 
upper shaft is disposed near said wall, the axis of rotation of said upper 

shaft being located at the side remote from the ejection slot of a vertical 
plane through the axis of rotation of the lower shaft. 
A metering device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a closing plate, which is pivotable about the central 

axis of the lower shaft, is provided near the trough-shaped bottom, by 
means of which closing plate the height of the ejection slot can be 

regulated from below. 
A metering device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that at least one vertically adjustable 

regulating valve is provided near the upper side of the ejection slot, 
by means of which the height of the ejection slot can be regulated from 

above. 
A metering device according to claim 4, characterized 
in that two regulating valves are provided in side-by-side relationship, 

in such a manner that the lower boundary edge of each regulating valve 
is horizontally adjustable at a desired angle with respect to the horizontal. 
A metering device according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that ejection blades are secured to 

the lower shaft in regularly spaced-apart relationship, said ejection 
blades being oriented substantially parallel to the central axis of the 

lower shaft. 
A metering device according to claim 6, characterized 
in that ejection blades mounted near the centre of the lower shaft extend 

substantially tangentially with respect to the outer circumference of the 
shaft. 
A metering device according to claim 6 or 7, 
characterized in that the ejection blades mounted at some distance from 

the middle of the lower shaft are provided with blades extending from said 
blades in a direction opposed to the direction of rotation of the shaft, 

said blades being directed in such a manner that they displace the casing 
soil inside the hopper in the direction of the nearest side wall of the 

hopper during operation. 
A metering device according to any one of the claims 
6 - 8, characterized in that the ejection blades mounted at some distance 

from the middle of the lower shaft are curved from their point of 
attachment to the shaft in a direction opposed to the intended direction 

of rotation of the lower shaft.
