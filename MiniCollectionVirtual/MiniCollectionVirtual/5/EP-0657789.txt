<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fusing system, method of fusing as well as a release
agent for the fusing system in an electrostatographic printing apparatus. In a particular
embodiment it relates to the use of a novel predominantly monoamino functional silicone oil
as a release agent in such a fusing system where the fuser member is a thermally stable
hydrofluoroelastomer.In a typical electrostatographic reproducing apparatus, a light image of an original to
be copied is recorded in the form of an electrostatic latent image upon a photosensitive
member and the latent image is subsequently rendered visible by the application of
electroscopic thermoplastic resin particles which are commonly referred to as toner. The visible
toner image is then in a loose powdered form and can be easily disturbed or destroyed. The
toner image is usually fixed or fused upon a support which may be photosensitive member
itself or other support sheet such as plain paper.The use of thermal energy for fixing toner images onto a support member is well
known. In order to fuse electroscopic toner material onto a support surface permanently by
heat, it is necessary to elevate the temperature of the toner material to a point at which the
constituents of the toner material coalesce and become tacky. This heating causes the toner to
flow to some extent into the fibers or pores of the support member. Thereafter, as the toner
material cools, solidification of the toner material causes the toner material to be firmly
bonded to the support.Typically, thermoplastic resin particles are fused to the substrate by heating to a
temperature of between about 90° C to about 160° C or higher depending upon the softening
range of the particular resin used in the toner. It is not desirable, however, to raise the
temperature of the substrate substantially higher than about 200°C because of the tendency of
the substrate to discolor at such elevated temperatures particularly when the substrate is
paper.Several approaches to thermal fusing of electroscopic toner images have been
described in the prior art. These methods include providing the application of heat and
pressure substantially concurrently by various means: a roll pair maintained in pressure
contact; a belt member in pressure contact with a roll; and the like. Heat may be applied by
heating one or both of the rolls, plate members or belt members. The fusing of the toner
particles takes place when the proper combination of heat, pressure and contact time are
provided. The balancing of these
