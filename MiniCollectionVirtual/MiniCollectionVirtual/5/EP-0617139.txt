<ABSTRACT>
A method for increasing the oxidation resistance 
of a Fe-Cr-Al alloy, comprises placing said Fe-Cr-Al 

alloy in an atmosphere having an oxygen partial atmosphere 
of 0.02-2 Pa at a temperature of 950-1,200°C to form, on the 

surface of said alloy, an alumina-based protective film 
having excellent oxidation resistance. 
The method enables the formation of a homogenous 
protective film having excellent oxidation resistance, even 

on alloys having non-homogeneous compositions, such as Fe-Cr-Al 
alloy and the like, and is very effective for increasing 

the oxidation resistance of Fe-Cr-Al alloy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for increasing the oxidation resistance of a Fe-Cr-Al alloy by forming 
a protective film of excellent oxidation resistance on the surface of said alloy. In order to increase the oxidation resistance of a metal, it is generally known to form an oxidation-resistant 
protective film on the surface of the metal. For example, an article 'Oxide Structure of Stainless Steels under Controlled Oxygen Atmospheres" (Toshiyuki 
Yashiro, "Heat Treatment", Vol. 31, No. 4, pp. 205-211, 1991) and an article "Surface Modification of Stainless 
Steels Using Thermal Passivation" (Toshiyuki Yashiro, Keiichi Terashima, Taketomo Yamazaki, "Surface Technology", 
Vol. 41, No. 3, pp. 41-48, 1990) report a method for increasing the corrosion resistance of stainless steel or the like, 
which comprises heat-treating stainless steel or the like in a low-pressure oxygen or a controlled atmosphere to form 
a passive oxide film on the surface. Also, Japanese Patent Publication No. 63148/1992 discloses a method for forming an alumina film on the 
surface of a TiAl intermetallic compound, which comprises placing said compound in an atmosphere having an oxygen 
partial pressure of 1x10-2 to 1x10-5 Pa at 900-1,050°C for 30 minutes to 100 hours to oxidize only Al selectively. The above prior art is used for stainless steel or the like, or a TiAl intermetallic compound. In relation to a Fe-Cr-Al 
alloy, however, the prior art process does not form a homogeneous protective film (an alumina film) because the 
pressure employed during film formation is too low (-10-2 Pa or lower). GB-A-2094656 describes pre-treatment of a foil to be used in an automotive catalytic converter. The foil is a 
ferritie alloy of by weight 15-25% Cr, 3-6% Al, 0.3-1.0% Y, balance Fe, and is heated in air at 1000°C for 1-24 hours. 
The oxide surface layer formed contains a small amount of yttrium oxide. Under such a situation, the present invention has the object to provide a method capable of forming a homogeneous 
protective film of excellent oxidation resistance even on a metal having a non-homogeneous composition, 
such as Fe-Cr-Al alloy or the like. The present invention provides a method for increasing the oxidation resistance of a Fe-Cr-Al alloy, which 
comprises placing said Fe-Cr-Al alloy in an atmosphere having an oxygen partial atmosphere of 0.02-2 Pa at a temperature 
of 950-1,200°C to form, on the surface of said alloy, an alumina-based protective film having excellent oxidation 
resistance. The present invention
