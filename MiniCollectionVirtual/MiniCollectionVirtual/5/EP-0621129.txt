<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a multilayer polypropylene film which comprises at least one base layer containing polypropylene and migrating additives or a mixture of migrating additives, and at least one top layer containing a mixture or blend of two components I and II. Component I contains essentially a propylenehomopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene and propylene or ethylene and butylene or propylene and butylene or ethylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or propylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or a terpolymer of ethylene and propylene and butylene or ethylene and propylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or a mixture of two or more of said homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers or a blend of two or more of said homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers, optionally mixed with one or more of said homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers. Component II essentially contains an HDPE or a blend of two blend components A and B. Blend component A is essentially an HDPE. Blend component B is essentially a propylene homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene and propylene or ethylene and butylene or propylene and butylene or ethylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or propylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or a terpolymer of ethylene and propylene and butylene or ethylene and propylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or a mixture of two or more of said homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers or a blend of two or more of said homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers. The film is matt.
