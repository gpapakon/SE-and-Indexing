<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a clamping frame for thermoforming machines, in particular vacuum forming machines. The clamping frame has a rigid outer frame (1), which is formed by the longitudinal frame parts (3, 4) and the transverse frame parts (5, 6). Held on the outer frame (1) is the inner frame (2), formed by the longitudinal bars (7, 8) and the transverse bars (9, 10). The inner frame (2) can be adjusted in size infinitely variably both in the transverse direction and in the longitudinal direction, independently of each other, by means of adjusting motors (11, 12). In this arrangement, the longitudinal bars (7, 8) are guided in a slidingly displaceable manner on the outer frame (1), while the transverse bars (9, 10) are held with telescoping bars respectively in a slidingly displaceable manner by a supporting or pressing bar (20), held in a slidingly displaceable manner on the outer frame (1). The clamping frame can consequently be set without any difficulties and in a time-saving manner to the respectively required size of the blank sheets or films of plastic to be processed; the setting-up times are reduced considerably.

Clamping frame for deep-drawing machines, particularly vacuum
moulding machines, comprising an outer frame (1) and an inner

frame (2) for clamping plastic plate or film blanks of different
sizes, which is held on said outer frame and designed

for motor-controlled infinitely variable adjustment of its
size, with said inner frame (2) including two longitudinal

strips (7, 8) and two transverse strips (9, 10),

characterised in

that said longitudinal strips (7, 8) are supported, via sliding
extensions (26), for sliding displacement in groove-shaped

recesses (27) on frame elements (5, 6) of said outer
frame (1), which are opposite each other,
that said transverse strips (9, 10) present each a pressing
strip (20) and a telescopic strip (21) which is held, via

clamping elements (22), on said pressing strip (20) for sliding
displacement,
that said pressing strips (20) are designed for sliding displacement
on opposite longitudinal frame elements (3, 4) of

said outer frame (1), and
that two spindle drive mechanisms (17) with right-hand and
left-hand thread spindle elements (13 to 16) each are provided

for said longitudinal strips (7, 8) and said transverse
strips (9, 10), which mechanisms are interconnected by a respective

chain (18, 19).
Clamping frame according to Claim 1, characterised in
that said spindle elements are arranged n the terminal regions

of said longitudinal strips (7, 8) and said transverse
strips (9, 10) and that one adjusting motor (11, 12) each is

provided for a pair of spindle elements (13, 14; 15, 16). 
Clamping frame according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that said spindle elements (15, 16) of said transverse strips

(9, 10) are engaged in threaded nuts (28) disposed on said
pressing strips (20).
Clamping frame according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that said spindle elements (13 to 16) present

an acme screw-thread.
Clamping frame according to any of the preceding Claims,
characterised in that for setting the frame size of said inner

frame (2) a displacement-metering system and a data memory
are provided for setting and calling in various sizes of

said inner frame (2).
