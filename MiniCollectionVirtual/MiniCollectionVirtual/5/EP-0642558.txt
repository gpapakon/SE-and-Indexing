<ABSTRACT>
Catalyzed, cationic lacquer binders which can be diluted in water after being protonized and which contain bismuth salts of aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acids are disclosed. The bismuth salts of lactic acid and of dimethylolpropionic acid are particularly appropriate. The compositions are used in cathodically precipitable dip laquers.

<CLAIMS>
Catalysed cationic paint binders which are waterthinnable after protonation,

characterised in that
 they contain cationic paint binders which are crosslinkable by
transesterification and/or transamidation and/or transurethanisation and/or by reaction of

terminal double bonds, and bismuth salts of lactic and/or dimethylol propionic acid.
Paint binders according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the bismuth content based on
the solids content of the paint binder is from 0.1 to 5.0 % by weight, preferably 0.5 to 3

% by weight.
Paint binders according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 they can be used as paste resin,
and that the bismuth content based on the solids content of the paint binder is from 0.5

to 25 % by weight, preferably from 1.5 to 20 % by weight.
Process for the preparation of paint binders according to Claim 2, 
characterised in that
,
prior to the addition of significant amounts of water as a diluent, the bismuth salt is

added in portions to the protonated binder solution at 60 to 80 째C and the mixture is
subsequently homogenised with stirring at 60 to 100 째C, preferably at 60 to 70 째C, for

several hours, preferably for 4 to 8 hours.
Process for the preparation of paint binders according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that

the bismuth salt is homogenised in the paint binder which can be used as paste resin in
a dissolver at 30 to 60 째C for 15 to 60 minutes and then in a bead mill, if appropriate in

the presence of pigments, for 0.5 to 1.5 hours.
Process according to Claims 4 and 5, 
characterised in that
, when using lactic acid or
dimethylolpropionic acid for neutralising the paint binders, the bismuth salts of t
he acids 
are replaced wholly or partly by the corresponding amounts of bismuth oxide or bismuth

hydroxide and homogenised.
Use of the paint binders according to Claims 1 to 3 in the formulation of cathodically
depositable electrodeposition coatings.
Cathodic electrodeposition coatings which contain the paint binders prepared according
to Claim 5 in the form of pigment pastes and further binders, the latter having a

chemical structure which is identical to or different from that of the paint binders
according to Claims 1 to 3 and being present, if appropriate, as dispersions.
