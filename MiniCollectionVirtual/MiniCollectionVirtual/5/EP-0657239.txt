<ABSTRACT>
The cutting end (7) or tip of a twist drill bit (1) has a hemispherical overall shape and has four cutting lips, two (8, 9) of which are arranged flight to flight at the top S of the drill bit. The cutting angle of the cutting edge of the said lips alters and varies from zero degrees at the top S up to a value determined experimentally as a function of the material to be machined at the point P, at the end of the diameter d of the drill bit.

<CLAIMS>
Drill bit with helical flutes having a cutting 
end (7) or drill head (1) which has a hemispherical 

overall shape, characterized in that the drill bit has 
four cutting lips, of which two lips (8, 9) are arranged 

so as to run on from one another at the tip S of the 
drill bit, the rake A of the edge of the said lips being 

progressive and varying from zero degrees at the tip S of 
the drill bit (1) situated on its geometric axis up to a 

value which is determined experimentally as a function of 
the material to be machined at the point (P) where the 

cutting edge intersects with the end of the diameter (d) 
on the outside of the drill bit, whereas the primary 

clearance angle D has a corresponding variation in the 
opposite direction, from the tip S to the point P. 
Drill bit according to Claim 1 intended for 
machining metallic materials such as superalloys, especially 

ones based on nickel or titanium alloys in which 
the magnitude of the rake at the said point P is as much 

as ten to twelve degrees.
