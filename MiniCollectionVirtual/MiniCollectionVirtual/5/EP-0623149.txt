<DESCRIPTION>
 POLYMERIZATION OF FUNCTIONALIZED MONOMERS WITH ZIEGLER-NATTA CATALYSTSField of the InventionThe invention < relates to functionalized polyolefins and particularly to methods of polymerizing alpha-olefins containing functional groups.Background of the InventionThe incorporation of functional groups onto poly(alpha-olefins) has been an area of long-standing interest as it represents a useful method for modifying the chemical and physical properties of poly(alpha- olefins) . Commercially useful improvements in the adhesive, thermal, rheological, morphological, and mechanical properties of the polymer can be achieved by introducing functionality onto the polymer. In addition, polyolefin polymers containing functional 

groups show improved affinity for dyes and printing agents and are more compatible with polar polymers.The preparation of functionalized poly(alpha- olefins) has proven to be a difficult challenge. Poly(alpha-olefins) are typically prepared with Ziegler- Natta type catalysts. These catalysts are remarkable in their ability to polymerize unactivated olefins to yield a variety of stereoregular and stereorando polymers. However, they have a major limitation as they are readily poisoned by monomers containing functional groups. Conventional catalysts based on Group 4 metal halides and alkylaluminum cocatalysts are intolerant to most types of monomers containing ethers, esters, amines, and carboxylic acids. Due to the interest in functionalized poly(alpha-olefins) , extensive research has focused on developing processes to produce func¬ tionalized poly(alpha-olefins) despite the intolerance of the conventional catalysts to functional groups. Strategies include both post-polymerization functionali- zation processes and the direct polymerization of sterically hindered, functionalized monomers.Post-polymerization functionalization techniques include free-radical grafting of unsaturated groups onto the polymer (Mukherjee et al., J. Macromol . Sci . Chem. , A19 (1983) , p. 1069) , polymer oxidation (Dasgupta, S., J. Appl . Polym. Sci . , 41 (1990), p. 233), anionic treatment of the polymer (Harada et al., Jpn Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 62054713) , and high energy radiation of the polymer (Stamm et al., J. Appl . Polym. Sci . , 7 (1963), p. 753). Some success has been achieved in this area as a wide variety of functionalized polymers have been synthesized and their properties studied. However, these methods are plagued with problems such as polymer degradation, polymer cross- linking, non-uniform
