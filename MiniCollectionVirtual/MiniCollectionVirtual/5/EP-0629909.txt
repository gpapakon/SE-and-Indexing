<ABSTRACT>
A silver halide color photographic light sensitive 
material comprising a support having thereon light-sensitive 

silver halide emulsion layers, and a nonlight-sensitive 
hydrophilic colloidal layer, wherein the color photographic 

material has a coating weight of silver of not more than 4.0 g 
per m² of a photographic material and an ISO speed of 25 or 

more, and wherein a silver halide emulsion contained in at 
least one of the light-sensitive emulsion layers is spectrally 

sensitized by a process comprising (i) forming a dispersion of 
a substantially water-insoluble spectral sensitizing dye in 

the form of solid particles dispersed in an aqueous medium 
which is free from an organic solvent or a surfactant and 

(ii) incorporating the dispersion in the silver halide 
emulsion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide color 
photographic light-sensitive material and, particularly, to a 
silver halide color photographic light-sensitive material 
excellent in preservability and processability, that is a 
satisfactorily silver-saving color photographic light-sensitive 
material. The recent technical progress of a silver halide color 
photographic light-sensitive materials (hereinafter sometimes 
referred to as a 'color light-sensitive material' or simply a 
'light-sensitive material') has been remarkable. It is the 
matter of course on the one hand that the improvements of 
photographic characteristics such as sensitivity and image-quality 
have been required as heretofore, and on the other 
hand that every product has recently been required further to  
 
have a global environmental aptitude from the viewpoints of a 
resource-saving, an energy-saving and environmental issues. For the saving of resources, a light-sensitive material 
has been demanded to save a coating weight of silver as much 
as possible, from the viewpoint for making effective use of a 
valuable silver resource as a raw material of silver halide 
grains applicable to a light-sensitive material. However, in 
a low silver-containing light-sensitive material, it has been 
difficult to save a silver content drastically, because the 
drastic saving thereof results in deterioration in image-qualities, 
particularly a graininess, and it also induces 
lowering of a contrast gradation and a color density, which 
are necessary for photographic characteristics. Generally, when reducing an silver coating weight from a 
color light-sensitive material, there have been some instances 
where a coupler amount is increased in or a highly developable 
silver halide is introduced into a light-sensitive material so 
as to enhance a color density. Each of these measures is 
rather unfavorable for a processing stability of a light-sensitive 
material. Particularly, in such a processing system 
as a mini-lab that has recently been on the rise, the demands 
from a mini-lab for the processing stability of a light-sensitive 
material have been particularly getting increased 
more than ever, because a rapid and low-replenishing process 
has been the main process.  From the viewpoint of a quality control, the essential 
factors include not only variations in sensitivity, and image-quality 
produced by a processing fluctuations, but also a 
characteristic change produced during a period from the 
delivery of the light-sensitive material to
