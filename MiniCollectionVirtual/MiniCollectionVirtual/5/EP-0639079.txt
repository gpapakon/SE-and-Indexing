<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a pharmaceutical
composition for preventing and treating diseases, and more
particularly, to a pharmaceutical composition for preventing and
treating certain Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) mediated diseases
and Interleukin-1 (IL-1) mediated diseases.Inflammation is the body's defense reaction to injury such as those caused by
mechanical damage, infection, or antigenic stimulation. An inflammatory reaction may be
expressed pathologically when inflammation is induced by an inappropriate stimulus such as
an autoantigen, expressed in an exaggerated manner, or persists well after the removal of the
injurious agents. Under these conditions, inflammation may be expressed chronically. The
mediation of acute inflammatory diseases such as septic shock and chronic inflammatory
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease has been linked to the
proinflammatory activities of IL-1 and TNF.TNF and IL-1 are naturally occurring compounds that are often referred to as
cytokines. Cytokines are extacellular proteins that modify the behavior of cells, particularly
those cells that are in the immediate area of cytokine synthesis and release.One of the most potent inflammatory cytokines yet discovered and a cytokine
which is thought to be a key mediator in many diseases and medical conditions is IL-1. IL-1,
which is manufactured, though not exclusively, by cells of the macrophage/monocyte
lineage, may be produced in two forms, IL-1 alpha (Il-1α) and IL-1 beta (IL-1β).Tumor Necrosis Factors (TNFs) are a class of cytokines produced by numerous
cell-types, including monocytes and macrophages. At least two TNFs have been previously
described, specifically TNF alpha (TNFα) and TNF beta (TNFβ or lymphotoxin). These
known TNFs have important physiological effects on a number of different target cells
involved in the inflammatory response. The proteins cause both fibroblasts and synovial
cells to secrete latent collagenase and prostaglandin E2, and cause osteocyte cells to stimulate
bone resorption. These proteins increase the surface adhesive properties of endothelial cells
for neutrophils. They also cause endothelial cells to secrete coagulant activity and reduce
their ability to lyse clots. In addition they redirect the activity of adipocytes away from the
storage of lipids by inhibiting expression of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. TNFs cause hepatocytes to synthesize a class of proteins known as "acute phase
reactants," which act on the hypothalamus as pyrogens.
