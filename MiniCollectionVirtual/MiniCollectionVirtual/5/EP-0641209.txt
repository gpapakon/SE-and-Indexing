TITLE OF THE INVENTIONNEW 17-ESTER. AMIDE. AND KETONE DERIVATIVES OF 3-OXO-4- AZASTEROIDS AS 5A-REDUCTASE INHIBITORSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to new I7B-ester, amide, and ketone derivatives of 4-aza-5a-androstan-3-ones and related compounds and the use of such compounds as 5a-reductase inhibitors.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ARTThe art reveals that certain undesirable physiological manifestations, such as acne vulgaris, seborrhea, female hirsutism, male pattern baldness and benign prostatic hyperplasia, are the result of hyperandrogenetic stimulation caused by an excessive accumulation of testosterone or similar androgenic hormones in the metabolic system. Early attempts to provide a chemotherapeutic agent to counter the undesirable results of hyperandrogenicity resulted in the discovery of several steroidal antiandrogens having undesirable hormonal activities of their own. The estrogens, for example, not only counteract the effect of the androgens but have a feminizing effect as well. Non-steroidal antiandrogens have also been developed, for example, 4'-nitro-3'- trifluoromethyl- isobutyranilide. See Neri, et al., Endo., Vol. 91 , No. 2 (1 72). However, these products, though devoid of hormonal effects, are peripherally active, compet¬ ing with the natural androgens for receptor sites, and hence have a tendency to feminize a male host or the male fetus of a female host.It is now known in the art that the principal mediator of androgenic activity in some target organs, e.g. the prostate, is 5a- dihydrotestosterone, and that it is formed locally in the target organ by the action of testosterone-5a-reductase. It is also known that inhibitors of testosterone-5a-reducta.se will serve to prevent or lessen symptoms of hyperandrogenetic stimulation. 

 For example, a number of 4-aza steroid compounds are known which are 5a-reductase inhibitors. See the following Merck & Co. nc- patents, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,377,584, 4,220,775, 4,859,681, 4,760,071 and the articles J. Med- Chem. 27, p. 1690-1701 (1984) andJ. Med. Chem. 29, 2998-2315 (1986) of Rasmusson, et al., and U.S. Patent 4,845,104 to Carlin, et al., and U.S. Patent 4,732,897 to Cainelli, et al. which describe 4-aza-17B-substituted-5a-androstan-3-ones said to be useful in the treatment of DHT-related hyperandrogenic conditions. Further there is the suggestion in the early prior art that hyperandrogenic diseases are the result of a single 5a-reductase. However, there are later reports regarding the presence of other 5a-
