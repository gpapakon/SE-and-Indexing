An electrohydraulic device for generating a force acting on movable 
piston rod (5) that is connected with the piston (4) of a 

cylinder (3), the device further including a first centrifugal pump 
(17, 19) disposed in the portion of the cylinder (3) facing away 

from the piston rod (5) and connected by way of a shaft (15) with 
an electric motor (2), a housing (1) for the cylinder (3) and the 

centrifugal pump (17, 19), with the housing defining a reservoir 
(14) intended for the operating fluid and being provided with 

passages (16, 19) for the shaft (15) and the piston rod (5), with 
the operating fluid being pumped through a pressure conduit (24) 

as a function of the direction or rotation of the electric motor (2) 
from a cylinder chamber (6) above the piston (4) into a cylinder 

chamber (6) below the piston (4) or in the opposite direction, thus 
causing the piston (4) to be moved due to the pressure acting on 

it and to generate forces at the piston rod (5)
characterized in that
 
a second centrifugal pump (18, 19) is provides below the first 

centrifugal pump (17, 19); both centrifugal pumps (17, 19; 18, 19) 
are in communication with the reservoir (14) by way of a passage 

(21, 22); above the piston (4), the cylinder chamber (6) is closed 
toward the reservoir (14); if the electric motor (2) rotates in a 

predetermined direction of rotation, the shaft (15) drives the first 
centrifugal pump (17, 19) and, in the opposite direction of rotation, 

the shaft (15) drives the second centrifugal pump (18, 19), 
while the respective other centrifugal pump idles; and, during 

operation of the second centrifugal pump (18, 19), the operating 
fluid is conveyed through the pressure conduit (24) into the cylinder 

chamber (6) above the piston (4) and, due to the pressure 
acting on it, the piston (4) is moved downward, thus imparting a 

downwardly acting traction force on the piston rod (5).  
 
An electrohydraulic device for generating a force acting on a movable 
piston rod (5) that is connected with the piston (4) of a 

cylinder (3), the device further including a first centrifugal pump 
(17, 25) disposed in the portion of the cylinder (3) facing away 

from the piston rod (5) and connected by way of a shaft (15) with 
an electric motor (2), a housing (1) for the cylinder (3) and the 

centrifugal pump (17, 25), with the housing defining a reservoir 
(14) intended for the operating fluid and being provided with

the operating fluid being pumped through a pressure conduit as a 

function of the direction or rotation of the electric motor (2) from 
a cylinder chamber (6) above the piston (4) into a cylinder chamber 

(7) below the piston (4) or in the opposite direction, thus 
causing the piston (4) to be moved due to the pressure acting on 

it and to generate forces at the piston rod (5)
 
characterized in that
 
a second centrifugal pump (17, 25) is provided on the shaft (15) 

below the first centrifugal pump (18, 25) and is connected, on the 
one hand, with the first centrifugal pump (17, 25) and, on the 

other hand, with the reservoir (14); the cylinder (3) is open to 
the reservoir above the piston (4) and the surface (26) of the 

operating fluid lies above the cylinder (3); if the electric motor 
(2) rotates in a predetermined direction of rotation, the shaft (15) 

drives the first centrifugal pump (17, 25) and, in the opposite direction 
of rotation, the shaft (15) drives the second centrifugal 

pump (18, 25), while the respective other centrifugal pump idles; 
and, during operation of the second centrifugal pump (18, 25), the 

operating fluid is conveyed into the cylinder chamber (6) above 
the piston (4) and, due to the pressure acting on it, the piston 

(4) is moved downward, thus imparting a downwardly acting traction 
force on the piston rod (5). 
An electrohydraulic device according to claim 1,
 
characterized in that
 
the two centrifugal pumps (17, 19; 18, 19) are constituted of two 

spaced apart facing impeller wheels (17, 18) that are arranged on 
the shaft (15) so as to rotate in opposite directions and of hollow 

cylindrical flow body (19) disposed between the impeller wheels  
 

(17, 18); and the cylinder chamber of the flow body (19) is 
connected with the reservoir (14) by way of passages (21, 22) in 

the cylinder wall and in the wall of a pump housing (12). 
An electrohydraulic device according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that
 
the two centrifugal pumps (17, 25; 18, 25) are constituted of two 

spaced apart facing impeller wheels (17, 18) that are arranged on 
the shaft (15) so as to rotate in opposite directions and of a flow 

body (25) disposed between the impeller wheels (17, 18). 
An electrohydraulic device according to claim 3 or 4,
 
characterized in that
 
the flow body (19, 25) is spaced from and approximately adapted 

to the course of the impeller wheels (17, 18). 
A electrohydraulic device according to one of claims 3 to 5,
 
characterized in that
 
the impeller wheels (17, 18) are mounted on the shaft (15) by 

means of oppositely rotating idler sleeves (20). 
An electrohydraulic device according to one of claims 3 to 6,
 
characterized in that
 
the impeller wheels (17, 18) of the two centrifugal pumps are configured 

to have different diameters.
