<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to the field of medical radiography. More
specifically this invention is related to an X-ray intensifying screen
which emits primarily ultraviolet radiation and to a radiographic
element comprising said X-ray intensifying screen.Medical radiography has been exploited for many years as a means
for visualizing and diagnosing internal, possibly pathological, structures in
living organisms. A patient is typically exposed to X-rays which are
selectively and partially absorbed by tissues and bones as they pass through
the patient. The X-radiation which thus passes partially attenuated through
the patient, carries information about the patients internal structure. Efforts
aiming to capture and display this information with the highest degree of
accuracy, minimal loss of information content and minimal patient exposure
constitute the basis for a large part of the research effort in radiography.Modern medical radiography systems typically utilize one or two
phosphor intensifying screens which absorb X-rays and emit visible or
ultraviolet light, thus translating the information initially carried by the X-ray
beam to information carried by longer wavelength radiation. This longer
wavelength image then impinges on a photographic element sensitive to the
actinic light emitted by the intensifying screen or screens. This photographic
element comprises one or two photosensitive elements coated on either side
of a support. Upon absorbing the actinic light emitted by the intensifying
screen or screens a latent image is formed in the photographic element, thus
rendering the photographic element developable and allowing an image of
the information originally carried by the X-ray beam to be recorded as a
permanent image. It is the aim of film/screen radiography to provide an image which
records the information carried by the X-ray beam traversing the patients as
faithfully as possible. The conversion of X-ray energy to actinic light in a
screen depends on the probability of each one of a sequence of steps as
follows:
(a) the probability that the screen will absorb an incoming X-ray
quantum,(b) the probability that a phosphor particle will emit a certain
number of light photons, and finally(c) the probability that a light photon, once emitted by a phosphor
particle and then being subjected to light scattering and possible absorption
within the screen, will emerge at the surface of the screen facing the
photosensitive element.The fact that the X-ray absorption and X-ray to light conversion
processes
