<ABSTRACT>
A point of sale terminal (11) is disclosed that provides all of the usual point of sale terminal functions, but that is entirely field portable. Data pertinent to each purchase can be input to the terminal via a keyboard assembly (17), a touch-screen display (19) or a signature-capture screen assembly (25), or via an antenna (39) and radio link from an associated bar code scanner. Data may be communicated at any time to a remote host computer, also via a separate antenna and radio link. The communication links with the host computer and the bar code scanner operate independently and simultaneously, using mutually compatible modulation schemes such as a spread spectrum scheme for the host computer link and a narrowband or spread spectrum scheme for the bar code scanner link. The terminal thereby functions as a portable repeater or node in a data communications network.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to point of
sale terminals and, more particularly, to point of sale
terminals adapted for portable use.Point of sale terminals are commonly used in
retail stores to record information relating to sales
transactions. In its most basic form, the terminal
includes a keyboard for the manual entry of data and a
printer for printing a paper tape receipt for delivery to
the customer. Many point of sale terminals are now
associated with bar code scanners for reading the bar
codes printed on the items being purchased. Most
commonly, the bar code scanners take the form of fixed
laser scanners built into a counter top at the point of
sale. Other bar code scanners include portable wands and
handheld scanners having scanning lasers or charge-coupled
device detectors for scanning the bar codes.Conventional point of sale terminals also
commonly include magnetic readers for reading the data
recorded on the customers' credit cards. The customers'
credit is then verified by electronically accessing an
appropriate database over a telephone line.Although the point of sale terminals described
generally above have proven to be extremely effective in
facilitating sales transactions, they have not proven to
be entirely satisfactory in all applications. Because the
terminals are essentially immobile, they are not adapted
for use in situations where merchandise is sold at remote
locations, away from a retail store environment, or at
movable locations within such a retail store environment.
It should therefore be appreciated that there is a need
for a point of sale terminal that provides the usual point 
of sale terminal functions, but that is portable.WO90/16033, which forms the basis for the pre-characterising part of claim 1,
discloses a battery-powered, hand-held data entry terminal having a keyboard
and a display mounted on a front face of a housing and a transceiver for
transmitting data to, and receiving data from, a remote host computer.IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, June 1992, Vol. 35, No. 1A, pages 315 -
318, discloses a self-checkout retail system utilising hand-held units for use by
customers, each hand-held unit incorporating a barcode scanner, a display, and
a "smart card" reader/writer for reading from and writing to a customer's "smart
card". The system utilises point-of-sale terminals with means for reading
customer's "smart cards" after removal of the same from the hand-held units, to
determine the cost of the purchases checked in by the customers using the
hand-held units.

<CLAIMS>
A portable terminal (11) comprising:

a hand-carryable housing (13) having a front face (15);
a keyboard (17) and a display (19) mounted on the front face of the
housing;
a power source (44) located within the housing;
and a first electromagnetic transceiver located within the housing for
transmitting and receiving data over the air to and from a host computer;

characterised in that the terminal is a point of sale terminal and includes
a second electromagnetic transceiver located within the housing, for

transmitting and receiving data over the air to and from a remote input-output
device,
the first electromagnetic transceiver transmits and receives data
modulated on a first carrier, in a spread spectrum format; and
the second electromagnetic transceiver transmits and receives data
modulated on a second carrier, in a narrowband format.
A portable point of sale terminal according to claim 1 wherein said
second carrier is located at the frequency of a null of the power spectrum of the

modulated first carrier.
A portable point of sale terminal as defined in claim 1, wherein the first
and second electromagnetic transceivers operate simultaneously, each

transmitting and receiving data over electromagnetic frequencies that do not
interfere with the other.
A portable point of sale terminal as defined in claim 1, wherein: 

the housing includes a recess (51) in its front face (15); and
the point of sale terminal further includes a plurality of keyboards (17),
each keyboard being sized to be removably received individually in the recess

(51) of the housing.
A portable point of sale terminal as defined in claim 4, wherein:

the power source (44) includes one or more removable batteries; and
each of the plurality of keyboards (17) can be mounted in the recess of
the housing, and removed from the recess of the housing, only if the one or

more batteries are removed from the housing.
A portable point of sale terminal as defined in claim 1, and further
including:


a printer (27) located within the housing (13), for printing information
on a strip (29) of paper and discharging the paper from the housing; and
a screen (25) mounted on the front face of the housing, for sensing the
manual writing of information thereon and generating corresponding data.
A portable point of sale terminal as defined in claim 6, wherein the
printer (27) is located adjacent to the screen (25) and is arranged such that the

discharged paper (29) overlays the screen (25).
A portable point of sale terminal as defined in claim 1, wherein the
display is adapted to sense the manual selection of information by an operator

of the terminal.
A portable point of sale terminal as defined in claim 1, and further
including: 


means defining a slot (21) in the front face (15) of the housing (13), the
slot being sized to receive one edge of a credit card; and
magnetic reader means located within the housing for reading data
recorded in a magnet strip of a credit card being slid along the slot.
