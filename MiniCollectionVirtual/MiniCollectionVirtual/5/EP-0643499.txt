<ABSTRACT>
An optical fiber communication system comprises a bus (36) to which 
are connected two or more individual stations (I,II,III,IV) with inputs (21) from the 

bus and outputs (22) to the bus. Each station includes an optical coupler, folded by 
means of a partially transmissive mirror, wherein the inputs and outputs are optically 

coupled. A light energy source (32) applies optical energy to the bus which passes 
through each station by means of the optical coupler associated therewith. Each 

station includes means (11,31,32) for modulating the light energy on the bus by 
varying the optical coupling, and each station has detector means (26) for receiving 

optical energy passing through the mirror and detecting the presence or absence of 
modulated signals on the bus. Control means (39) at each station initiates operating 

commands on the basis of the energy detected by the detector means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to optical communication systems and, more 
particularly, to an optical fiber network arrangement for communications among a 
plurality of stations. Present day network systems, such as local area (LAN), metropolitan area 
(MAN), and wide area (WAN), generally utilize electrical signal transmission 
arrangements wherein switching, modulation, demodulation, and the like are all 
performed electrically. However, the emphasis is now upon developing optical 
arrangements for such networks because of the numerous advantages inherent in 
optical signaling and transmission. Optical systems are generally immune to the 
effects of electrical radiation, do not produce electromagnetic interference (EMI), 
have no ground loop problems, and, generally, optical fiber has less signal 
attenuation over a given distance than co-axial cable. A local network known as ALOHA is an example of a local area network 
(LAN) upon which much effort has been expended in converting it and derivatives 
thereof from electrical to optical transmission. The ALOHA network, based upon 
wireless transmission with a common radio frequency, was an early LAN approach in 
which stations were transmitting whenever they had information to communicate. 
"Collisions" occurred whenever there were two or more stations transmitting at the 
same time, not by design. A station did not "know" that it had-transmitted 
successfully unless it received a confirmation or acknowledgment within a reasonably 
short time after the transmission. Subsequent to the development of ALOHA was the development of a Media 
Access Control (MAC) protocol for use with stations connected to a common coaxial 
cable electrical bus using a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection 
(CSMA/CD) scheme which represented an improvement over the ALOHA scheme. 
With CSMA/CD, local area networks, for example, experience fewer collisions, and, 
when collisions do occur, a station detecting a collision directly will stop transmitting 
the remainder of its message packet. Statistical analysis shows that the CSMA/DC 
media access control protocol has twice the average through-put at optimum loading 
than ALOHA for the same speed of transmission. Also, with CSMA/CD, a station 
does not need to wait for a confirmation message to know that it has been successful 
in sending its message. This is a direct result of the collision detection feature. The 
station only transmits when the line is clear, and, having detected no collision during  
 
transmission, it
