Applicator comprising a reservoir (2) which 
contains a substance (5) to be applied, a cap (4) which 

is intended to close the reservoir (2), and an applicator 
holder (30) supporting a deformable element (35, 135, 

235, 335, 435, 535, 635) for applying the substance (5), 
this element being made of foam or of low-hardness 

elastomer, the deformable element (35, 135, 235, 335, 
435, 535, 635) having a roughened surface and being 

provided with a substantial shape memory, characterized 
by the fact that the reservoir (2) holding the substance 

(5) is limited by a finger-shaped capillary end-piece 
(11) having a base (20) equipped with a seat (24) which 

is pierced with at least one capillary orifice (23, 230) 
against which the deformable element (35, 135, 235, 335, 

435, 535, 635) is applied and deformed in the position in 
which the reservoir (2) is closed by the cap (4). 
Applicator according to Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that the capillary orifice (23), of which there 

is at least one, is circular and its diameter is between 
0.5 and 3 mm. 
Applicator according to Claim 1, characterized by 
the fact that the capillary orifice (230), of which there 

is at least one, is a slit having a cross-section of 
between 0.2 and 7 mm
2
. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that the end of the deformable 

element (135, 435, 535) which cooperates with the seat 
(24) and the orifice (23, 230) is flat. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that the end of the deformable 

element (35, 235) which cooperates with the seat (24) and 
the orifice (23, 230) is in the shape of a conical tip. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by the fact that the end of the deformable 

element (335, 635) which cooperates with the seat (24) 
and the orifice (23, 230) is round. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 6,  
 

characterized by the fact that the applicator holder (30) 
supporting the deformable element (35, 135, 235, 335) 

comprises a hollow rod (31). 
Applicator according to Claim 7, characterized by 
the fact that the applicator holder (30) supporting the 

deformable element (35, 135, 235, 335) comprises a rigid 
support sleeve (34) in the shape of an ogive. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized by the fact that the applicator holder 

(400, 500, 600) supporting the deformable element (435, 
535, 635) comprises a solid rod (431, 531, 631). 
Applicator according to Claim 9, characterized by 
the fact that the solid rod (531, 631) is equipped, at 

its end, with a stiffening element (534, 634) of elongate 
shape for guiding the deformable element (535, 635) 

during its deformation. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized by the fact that the end-piece (11) is 

supported by a spacer element (10) which is integral with 
the reservoir (2) and through which the applicator holder 

(30) passes. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 11, 
characterized by the fact that the orifice (23, 230) 

opens out in the reservoir (2) along a flared, frusto-conical 
portion (22, 231, 232) which serves as a capillary 

reservoir. 
Applicator according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized by the fact that the end-piece (11) is made 

of semi-rigid material.
