<ABSTRACT>
To protect potential landslide slopes and stabilse landslides (1) in cohesive, swellable cohesive to generally fine-grained soils in which a minor coarse part can be present, a method has been developed in which at least one fully path-controlled bore (6) is driven from at least one point outside the potential landslide slope (1) or the landslide (1) from above or below or from the side of the landslide slope (1). The fully path-controlled bore (6) is then driven at the desired point through the slip plane (3) of the landslide (1) into the landslide slope (1), and a suitable injection medium is injected from the bore (6) to consolidate the surrounding soil area (4) of the bore (6).
