<ABSTRACT>
An atrial and ventricular defibrillation pulse generator and lead system particularly adapted to allow for implant via a single incision. The electrode system consists of a right ventricular electrode and a single subcutaneous electrode, which is preferably located on the housing of the implantable defibrillator. The ventricular and subcutaneous electrodes are used for both atrial and ventricular defibrillation, with higher energy pulses being delivered during ventricular defibrillation. The defibrillator is preferably planted in the left pectoral region of the body, and includes a pulse generator for applying biphasic defibrillation pulses between the two electrodes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical electrical 
stimulators and leads generally, and more particularly to 
implantable defibrillators, their electrodes and leads. Early concepts of implantable defibrillators, such as 
disclosed in Reissue Patent No. 27,652 by Mirowski, et al, 
envision an electrode system employing a ventricular 
endocardial electrode and a plate electrode mounted to the 
heart directly, subcutaneously, or to the skin. U.S. Patent 
No. 3,942,536 by Mirowski, et al, discloses a transvenous lead 
having electrodes intended for location in the right 
ventricular apex and in the superior vena cava. This 
electrode system is disclosed as useful for either ventricular 
or atrial defibrillation. Such systems were eventually tested 
in human beings, with some success. Currently available 
implantable defibrillators typically employ epicardial or 
subcutaneous patch electrodes, alone, or in conjunction with 
one or more transvenous electrodes. It is generally believed that it would be desirable to 
produce an implantable defibrillation system which entirely 
avoids the necessity of a thoracotomy, and there has been 
substantial work directed towards development or multi-electrode 
systems to accomplish this result, as disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 4,727,877 issued to Kallok, U.S. Patent No. 
4,708,145 issued to Tacker, et al, and as disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 5,099,838, issued to Bardy. Other endocardial 
defibrillation electrodes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 
4,481,953 issued to Gold et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,161,952 
issued to Kinney, et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,934,049 issued to 
Kiekhafer et al and in U.S. Patent No. 5,042,143 issued to 
Holleman, et al. The Kinney, Gold, Holleman and Kiekhafer 
patents all disclose endocardial defibrillation leads  
 
employing defibrillation electrodes fabricated from elongated 
coils of biocompatible metal, mounted exposed to the exterior 
of the defibrillation lead, for location in the right 
ventricle and other locations within the heart. The above-cited 
Smits patent and the Mehra application both disclose a 
variety of endocardial defibrillation electrodes intended for 
use in the atrium, ventricle and coronary sinus, all of which 
employ electrodes taking the form of elongated coils of 
conductive biocompatible metals. A return to lead systems employing only two electrodes 
for ventricular defibrillation is suggested in U.S. Patent No. 
4,922,927, issued to Fine et al. This patent proposes the use 
of an electrode system as in the above-cited
