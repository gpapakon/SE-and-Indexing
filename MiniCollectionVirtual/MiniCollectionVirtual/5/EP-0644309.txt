<ABSTRACT>
A device for moving sliding doors which includes a mechanism for moving 
and supporting a door (8) is driven by a DC electric motor (17) and is provided 

with an emergency operation system in case of black-out consisting of at least 
one capacitor capable of delivering a capacitive discharge suitable to allow at 

least two operating cycles of the device. The movement of door (8) preferably 
takes place along an arc of circumference centered on the vertical, and the 

device thus includes a spring (12) suitable to make resistance during the 
lowering of door (8) and to help the rotation during the rising of door (8), whereby 

the power required along the whole said arc is kept practically constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns devices for moving sliding elements and in 
particular a device for moving sliding doors such as those used to close 
passageways in areas where control of the people's passage is required 
(underground stations, factories, offices, etc.). It is known that present moving devices substantially include an AC electric 
motor which, through a reducer. drives a mechanism which supports the door 
and makes it slide orthogonally to the direction of passage so as to open or close 
the passageway. The device operation logic varies according to the specific 
application, ranging from the passageway always closed and opened only upon 
clearance (underground) to the passageway always open and closed only upon 
detection of an error condition (for example connected to a metal detector). Whichever the specific application may be, the use of an AC motor has a 
serious drawback in case of lack of tension or black-out. In this instance, in fact, 
the device is no more supplied and can not operate unless it is connected to a 
no-break power unit, as disclosed, for instance, in FR-A-2619153. Such a unit obviously involves a significant cost and room, 
and is thus seldom used. Therefore, the devices of the prior art, in general, 
include just a counterweight which is raised upon closing the doors. so as to give 
it a sufficient potential energy to drive the opening mechanism in case of black-out. 
In the opposite case wherein the counterweight is raised upon opening, then 
it would obviously operate to close the passageway. Finally, it would be possible 
to arrange the counterweight so that it carries out an operating cycle regardless 
of the device position at the moment of the black-out, i.e. opening the 
passageway if it was closed or closing it if it was open. However, any solution adopted allows only the opening or only the closing 
of the passageway. and just for a single operating cycle. It is clear that this is a 
problem in those applications wherein the continuous operation of the device 
even in case of black-out is essential, or in the case in which a change in the 
situation requires one or more operating cycles in addition to the first one. Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a device which 
overcomes the above-mentioned drawbacks. This object is achieved by means of a device having the characteristics 
cited in claim 1. A first apparent advantage of the present device is its capacity of 
performing more than one operating cycle after a black-out,
