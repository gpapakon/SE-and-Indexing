<ABSTRACT>
Small arms projectile (1), intended primarily for use with rifle bores, produced from steel with a low carbon (C) content and preferably including tellurium (Te) to an amount of 0.02-0.04 % and lead (Pb) to an amount of 0.15-0.35 %, acting in combination to provide to the steel a high cutting capacity and a lubricant effect that is utilized to reduce the friction wear occurring as the projectile passes the bore. The projectile (1) comprises circumferentially applied grooves and lands (4) and in a specific embodiment a slanted shoulder (5) in the intermediate section between the torpedo section (2) and guide section (3), whereby a circular through hole with unrippled edges is punched through the target upon target shooting. The bullet comprises an anticorrosive coating, preferably electro-chemically applied.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bullet or a projectile for firearms,
preferably riflebores, and more specifically to a projectile made
of steel, the employment of steel for producing such a projectile
and a method for producing said projectile.The predominant material used in rifle bore bullets is lead (Pb),
most frequently surrounded by a jacket made from copper-zink
alloy or from plated steel. On one hand, the jacket functions as
a protection for the soft lead core against external deformation,
and on the other hand to allow firing at the high muzzle
velocities connected with modern firearms. At these velocities,
a non-jacketed bullet would deposit lead in the barrel bore due
to friction heat. Furthermore, in game hunting, the jacket
increases the bullets effect upon impact in that it preserves the
form of the lead core as the bullet penetrates the game and
thereby permits a desired, deep penetration. This later aspect,
of course, is of little importance in the field of practise- and
contest shooting.The jacketed lead bullet is manufactured through several steps.
Jacket blanks are punched from a jacket plate and formed to a
sleeve through two or more form pressing operations. The lead
core, possibly with antimony added to increase the hardness, is
draw formed through tapered bores to have the accurate gauge, and
cold formed to fit the jacket. In a joining operation the lead
core is fitted within the jacket, whereupon a close fit between
core and jacket is of utmost importance, since the occurance of
airpockets would cause unbalance with the bullet, resulting in
a poor score. In the joining operation, multiple tools are
employed, generally up to six tools, between which the bullets
and jackets are moved under the operation, and finally the
completed bullets are controlled with respect to e.g. gauge and
weight. The jacketed lead bullet is available in multiple embodiments,
among which the common feature is, that the varied shapings
particularly in the sense of jacket construction, are contemplated
to increase the effect and penetration ability of the bullet
upon game hunting. However, the major part of firearms ammunition
is used for practice- and contest shooting, wherein such
properties as a fast kill are of no importance. Naturally, for
the purpose of sight adjustment and range finding of hunting
rifles, some target shooting will take place with the ammunition
that later is used for the game hunting, but this particular
gallery shooting constitutes merely a minor part of the total
amount of rifle
