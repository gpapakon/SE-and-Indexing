<ABSTRACT>
A method for automatically controlling a collimated sputtering source 
that is controllable by a computer to compensate for the build-up of sputtered material 

on the collimator. The method involves providing software for the computer 
including a formula to calculate a multiplier as a function of the age of the collimator, 

sequentially depositing film on a series of substrates using the sputtering source, 
monitoring the age of the collimator, and using the software to periodically adjust the 

value of a controllable sputtering parameter as a function of the multiplier. The 
sputtering parameter is automatically adjusted by the software such that a property of 

the film deposited by the source on the series of substrates does not substantially vary 
among the substrates as sputtered material builds up on the collimator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the physical vapor deposition of thin 
films and more particularly to automatically controlling a collimated sputtering source 
such that the thickness of film deposited by the source does not vary as sputtered 
material builds up on the collimator. The invention is particularly useful in providing 
for continuous, automatic compensation for the build up of sputtered material on a 
collimator used during semiconductor device fabrication. Deposition of thin films of various materials on a substrate or wafer is 
one of the primary processes used in the fabrication and processing of microelectronic 
devices, such as integrated circuit chips. Successful film deposition generally requires 
control of various characteristics of the deposited films. For example, films having a 
predetermined uniform thickness commonly are required. Uniformity of film 
thickness over the surface of a wafer and from one wafer to another are similarly 
important. In many applications it is also important for the film to sufficiently fill 
vias or holes in the substrate. Finally, the deposited films must meet demanding 
specifications for such factors as resistivity, grain size, etc. For many years, the 
trend in semiconductor device fabrication has been toward ever increasing device 
density and the use of ever larger wafer substrates. The result of this trend has been 
increasingly demanding requirements for deposited films. Commercial fabrication of 
electronic devices having features in the sub-micron range on eight-inch wafers is now 
commonplace in the industry. One of the most commonly used film deposition techniques is sputtering 
within a vacuum chamber using a magnetron sputtering source. In a conventional 
magnetron sputtering source, a low-pressure plasma consisting of positive ions from a 
support gas, such as argon, bombards the surface of a cathode made of a target 
material to be sputtered. The impact of the ions dislodges particles from the target 
cathode. The sputtered particles leave the target in a variety of directions and may be 
further scattered due to collisions with gas ions or molecules or with each other.  
 
Some of the sputtered particles are directed toward the substrate and attach to the 
surface of the substrate, forming a coating or film. In conventional sputtering, the 
deposited film is of the same material or alloy of materials as the sputter target. In 
reactive sputtering, a reactive gas is introduced into the vacuum chamber to form a 
film comprising a
