<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous, correction fluid that includes a suspending agent, a binding resin, water, and an opacifying pigment. The suspending agent is preferably a gum or hydrocolloid, e.g., xanthan gum, and the composition preferably has a shear-thinning index (n) of from about 0.08 to 0.50. The fluid may be dispensed from a pen as described in the figure or from a container. A dispenser (10) comprises elongated body member (12) and barrel (14). A tubular passage (16) extends through barrel (14) and opens rearwardly into body member (12) for flow of correction fluid from the body member into barrel (14). Within tubular passage (16) a tubular spring retainer (26) is disposed in interfitting engagement with barrel (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to correction
fluids.Correction fluids are used for
correcting handwritten, typewritten or
photocopied markings on paper. Generally,
correction fluids are applied to a paper surface
in liquid form. After application, the fluids
dry relatively quickly to provide a film which
can effectively cover erroneous markings on the
surface and can receive a corrected marking. It
is desired that the dried film be strongly
bonded to the paper surface, and sufficiently
flexible that the film will not be removed under
normal conditions. It is also desired that the
composition dry at a rapid rate. Other desired
performance characteristics include good storage
stability, and flow and viscosity
characteristics which permit easy and even
application of the fluid.Correction fluids typically contain a
binding resin that provides the flexible film,
and an opacifying pigment, usually titanium
dioxide, dispersed in a solvent. It is
desirable, for environmental reasons, that
correction fluids include little or no volatile
organic solvents. Correction fluids are often supplied in a small bottle with an applicator
brush attached to the cap. Since the opacifying pigment in the fluid (typically titanium
dioxide) tends to settle out over time, glass or metal mixing beads are sometimes included
to help redisperse the agent, the user being instructed to shake the bottle prior to use.
However, thorough shaking is commonly regarded as a nuisance, so that much of the
opacifying pigment remains at the bottom of the bottle. This condition is exacerbated by
evaporation of the solvent component when the bottle is open. Accordingly, much of the
correction fluid in each bottle may be thrown away as the solids become increasingly
difficult to redisperse.US-A-4 486 246 discloses an improved aqueous based, shock resistant,
shear-thinning ink composition and writing instruments including the ink composition.
The ink compositions comprise a substantially uniform dispersion of colorant(s), a water
dispersible polymeric shear-thinning material and a substantially water insoluble
polymeric material in a polar solvent system.US-A-4 786 198 discloses an aqueous based, water-fast, shock resistant,
shear-thinning ink composition and ball-point pens including the ink composition. The
ink composition comprises a substantially uniform dispersion of colorant(s), a water
dispersible, polymeric shear-thinning material and a substantially water soluble polymeric
binder material in a highly polar solvent system. On drying, the ink
