<DESCRIPTION>
 N-ΓN ' - ( 5-AMINO-4-HYDROXY-ACYLOYI 6( -AMINOACYLOYL] SUBSTITUTED HETEROCYCLES AND THEIR USE AS ANTIVIRAL AGENTSThe present invention relates to certain peptide derivatives ∞nta-i-ning a heterocyclic group which are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of human retroviral infections.The human i-mmunodeficiency virus (HIV) , a retrovirus, is the causative agent of a variety of clinical conditions, the most serious of which are ∞mmonly termed AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) , and ARC (AIDS-Related Complex) . Infection with HIV is characterised by progressive breakdown of the immune system and CNS dysfunction. Severely i-mmune deficient patients suffer from a wide range of opportunistic infections (e.g. pneuroocvstis carinii, human cyteimegalovirus, or Candida) , and cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma. Loss of cells, particularly+ . . . . . .CD4 lymphocytes, following infection with HIV is an l-nportant factor in the progressive impairment of -ϋπmune function. The infection of cells of raorκx-yte/macrophage lineage with HTV also contributes to the observed pathology. Unas, successful infection of CD4 cells by HIV is a key step in the disease process.HIV is a retrovirus; it encodes its genetic information in RNA, which is converted into DNA after the virus enters the host cell. An essential step in the retroviral replication cycle is the processing of an initial polypeptide precursor into mature structural and replicative proteins. This processing is carried out by a virus-coded protease and, in the absence of this enzyme activity, viral replication is blocked.We have discovered that certain peptide derivatives linked to a heterocyclic group are potent inhibitors of retroviral proteases, both in a cell-free assay and in infected cells and, in addition, show antiviral activity in tissue culture assays. This activity renders such ∞mpounds useful for the treatment and prophylaxis of retroviral infections, in particular, those caused by HIV. 

 Thus, the invention provides cxfmpσunds of the formula :-(I)and pha-t-maceutically acceptable salts thereof and bicprecursors therefor, wherein R is C,-C8 alkyl C_-C cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl or R7R8NCO; R 2 i .s C.-Cg alkyl, C.-Cg cycloalkyl (C.-C.) alkyl, aryl (C,^.) alkyl, or heterocyclyl (C-.-C.) alkyl;R is C,-C alkyl, C -C cycloalkyl, C -C cycloalkyl (C--C ) alkyl, aryl(C,-C,) alkyl, >aryl(C -C )- alkenyl, heterocyclyl (C,-C ) alkyl or heterocyclyl-(C2-C4)alkenyl;R is C,-C- alkyl, C_-C cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl; R 5 and R6 are each
