<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to polypeptides and their use in the diagnosis and
therapy of disorders involving complement activity and various inflammatory and
immune disorders.Constituting about 10% of the globulins in normal serum, the complement
system is composed of many different proteins that are important in the immune
system's response to foreign antigens. The complement system becomes activated
when its primary components are cleaved and the products alone or with other
proteins, activate additional complement proteins resulting in a proteolytic cascade.
Activation of the complement system leads to a variety of responses including
increased vascular permeability, chemotaxis of phagocytic cells, activation of
inflammatory cells, opsonization of foreign particles, direct killing of cells and tissue
damage. Activation of the complement system may be triggered by antigen-antibody
complexes (the classical pathway) or, for example, by lipopolysaccharides present in
cell walls of pathogenic bacteria (the alternative pathway).Complement receptor type 1 (CR1) has been shown to be present on the
membranes of erythrocytes, monocytes/macrophages, granulocytes, B cells, some T
cells, splenic follicular dendritic cells, and glomerular podocytes. CR1 binds to the
complement components C3b and C4b and has also been referred to as the C3b/C4b
receptor. The structural organisation and primary sequence of one allotype of CR1 is
known (Klickstein et al., 1987, J. Exp. Med. 165:1095-1112, Klickstein et al., 1988,
J. Exp. Med. 168:1699-1717; Hourcade et al.,1988, J. Exp. Med. 168:1255-1270,
WO 89/09220, WO 91/05047). It is composed of 30 short consensus repeats (SCRs)
that each contain around 60-70 amino acids. In each SCR, around 29 of the average
65 amino acids are conserved. Each SCR has been proposed to form a three
dimensional triple loop structure trough disulphide linkages with the third and first
and the fourth and second half-cystines in disulphide bonds. CR1 is further arranged
as 4 long homologous repeats (LHRs) of 7 SCRs each. Following a leader sequence,
the CR1 molecule consists of the N-terminal LHR-A, the next two repeats, LHR-B
and LHR-C, and the most C-terminal LHR-D followed by 2 additional SCRs, a 25
residue putative transmembrane region and a 43 residue cytoplasmic tail.Based on the mature CR1 molecule having a predicted N-terminal glutamine
residue, hereinafter designated as residue 1, the first four SCR domains of LHR-A are
defined herein as consisting of residues 2-58, 63-120, 125-191 and
