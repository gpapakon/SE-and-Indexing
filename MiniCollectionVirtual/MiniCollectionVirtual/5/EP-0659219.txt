<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method of manufacturing cellulose fibres by extruding a solution of cellulose in a tertiary-amine oxide through the holes of a spinneret and passing the extruded filaments under tension through an air gap and into a regenerating bath. The method is characterized in that it is carried out in such a way that the maximum value of the mathematical expression 51.4 + 0.033xD + 1937xM
<

 - 7.18xT - 0.094xL - 2.50xF + 0.045xF

 in which D is the spinneret-hole diameter in  mu m, M is the spinning-solution throughput per hole in g/min, T is the titre of a single filament in dtex, L is the length of the air gap in mm and F is the humidity of the air in the air gap in g of water per kg of air, is 10, with the provision that the length of the air gap is greater than 30 mm. This method gives cellulose fibres with a very low tendency to fibrillation.

Process for the preparation of cellulose fibres in which a 
solution of cellulose in a tertiary amine-oxide is extruded 

through orifices in a spinneret and the extruded filaments 
are led under tension across an air gap into a 

precipitation bath, with the proviso that the width of the 
air gap is greater than 30 mm, characterised in that the 

process is carried out in such a way that the mathematical 
expression 


51.4 + 0.033xD + 1937xM

wherein D is the diameter of the spinning orifice in µm, M 

is the output of spinning material per orifice in g/min, T 
is the titre of the individual filaments in dtex, L is the 

width of the air gap in mm, and F is the humidity of the 
air in the air gap in g water/kg air
 
has a maximum value of 10. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that 
the process is carried out in such a way that the 

mathematical expression has a maximum value of 5. 
Process in accordance with one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the output of spinning material per 

orifice is between 0.025 and 0.05 g/min. 
Process in accordance with one or more of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the width of the air gap is less than 

100 mm. 
Process in accordance with Claims 1 or 2, characterised in 
that when using a spinneret with orifices whose diameter is 

between 70 and 130 µm, the humidity of the air in the air 
gap is maintained between 20 and 30 g water/kg air.  

 
Cellulose fibres of the Lyocell type with reduced tendency 
to fibrillation obtained in accordance with a process as 

claimed in Claims 1 to 5.
