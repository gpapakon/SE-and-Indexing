<ABSTRACT>
A fastening device (10) for fastening a web-like 
material to a bag or like garment article comprises a 

connecting member (11), a link (12) rotatable relative 
thereto, a cylindrical retaining member (13) fitted 

rotatably over the connecting member (11) and having a 
retaining bar (23), and a hook member (14) having a 

J-shaped hook (27). A retaining pin member (15) is 
adapted to interconnect the connecting member (11), the 

retaining member (13) and the hook member (14) and is 
resiliently releasable from the retaining member (13) to 

permit the latter to rotate so that the retaining bar 
(23) moves out of registration with the J-shaped hook 

(27).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fastening device for 
fastening or connecting a strap, belt or similar 
web-like materials to a bag or other garment articles. Exemplary of such a fastening device is one which 
has an annular connector for connecting a loose end of a 
strap secured to for instance a shoulder bag or the 
like, a generally "J"-shaped hook member and a retainer 
interposed between the connector and the hook member and 
normally biased toward and adapted to rotatably close or 
open the hook member. A typical example of such a 
rotary type of fastener is disclosed in Japanese Utility 
Model Laid-Open Disclosure No. 2-107814, the disclosed 
device comprising a "J"-like hook member having a hook 
mouth at one end for releasably receiving a bag link and 
a support pin secured at the opposite end, a ring member 
adapted to connect the strap and a retaining member 
normally urged by a coil spring toward the hook member, 
both the ring and the retaining member being mounted 
rotatably coaxially on the support pin. Since the 
retaining member is brought into abutting engagement  
 
with the hook member and so retained only by the action 
of the coil spring, there is a tendency that when 
rotated accidentally, the retaining member departs from 
and leaves the mouth of the hook open unintentionally to 
release the bag link. The prior art device has a 
further drawback in that it involves various complicated 
operating parts, requiring time-consuming and tedious 
assembly as a whole and particularly in mounting and 
positioning the coil spring. With the foregoing drawbacks of the prior art in 
view, the present invention seeks to provide a fastening 
device which incorporates means for effectively 
retaining the fastening device in position against 
accidental rotation to prevent separation of a garment 
article from the device. The invention further seeks to provide a fastening 
device comprising a minimum number of component parts 
which can be assembled with utmost ease and accuracy. The above and other objects, features and 
advantages of the invention will appear clear from the 
following detailed description taken with reference to 
the accompanying drawings. According to the invention, there is provided a 
fastening device for fastening a web-like material to a 
garment article which comprises a connecting member 
having an opening and a hole diametrically opposed 
thereto; a link rotatably connected to the connecting 
member; a retaining member having a cylindrical bore  
 
dimentioned to fit over
