<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a drive combination for the rear wheel drive of a transport vehicle, especially a large capacity transport vehicle, comprising: an internal combustion engine, the crankshaft of which is arranged horizontally and transversely or longitudinally to the direction of travel; a transmission - manual transmission or automatic transmission - driven by the internal combustion engine, the output shaft of which transmission is arranged transversely to the direction of travel; a spur gear unit with at least two spur gears. The invention is characterised in that a first spur gear is non-positively connected to the output shaft of the transmission; and a last spur gear of the spur gear unit is non-positively connected by way of a differential to a vehicle power axle.

<CLAIMS>
A drive combination for the rear drive of a transporting vehicle, particularly a
large capacity transporting vehicle, with the following features:


1.1 an internal combustion engine (M), of which the crankshaft is disposed
horizontally and transversely or longitudinally in relation to the direction

of travel;
1.2 driven by the internal combustion engine (M) a gear mechanism (2) -
gear

shift mechanism or automatic gearbox -, the output shaft of which is
disposed crosswise to the direction of travel;
1.3 a spur gear mechanism (8) with at least two spur gears - of a spur gear

chain -, whereby

1.3.1 a first spur gear is positively connected to the output shaft of the gearbox
(2), and
1.3.2 a last spur gear (7) of the spur gear transmission (8) is operatively
connected to a vehicle driving axle via a differential gear mechanism (6);
1.4 at least one electric motor (9) is positively connected to at least one spur
gear of the spur gear mechanism (8);
1.5 motor (M) and gear mechanism (2) are disposed vertically above the
driving axle of the vehicle.
A drive combination according to claim 1, characterised in an articulated shaft (5)
is provided for the operative connection of gear mechanism (2) and spur gear

mechanism (8).
A drive combination according to one of claims 1 to 2, characterised in that at
least the arbor of the first spur gear of the spur gear mechanism encloses an acute

angle with the arbor of the subsequent spur gear, both spur gears having involute
gear teeth. 
A drive combination according to claim 3, characterised in that the output shaft
of the gear mechanism forms an acute angle with the main shaft of the gear

mechanism.
