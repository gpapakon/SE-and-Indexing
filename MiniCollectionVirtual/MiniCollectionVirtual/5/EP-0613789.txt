<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a heat sensitive 
recording material comprising a recording layer formed on a 

substrate and containing a colorless or light-colored basic 
dye and a color acceptor, the material being characterized in 

that the basic dye is 3-diethylamino-7-[m-(trifluoromethyl)phenylamino]fluoran 

and/or 3-di-n-pentylamino-6-methyl-7-phenylaminofluoran, 
the color acceptor being 4,4'-dihydroxydiphenylsulfone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heat sensitive 
recording materials, and more particularly to heat sensitive 
recording materials which are free of background fogging and 
excellent in the preservability of recorded images in high-temperature 
environments. Heat sensitive recording materials are well known 
which utilize the reaction between a colorless or light-colored 
basic dye and a color acceptor for producing recorded 
images by thermally reacting the two chromogenic substances. 
Such recording materials are relatively inexpensive, are 
usable with a recording device which is compact and free of 
maintenance and are therefore in use in a wide variety of 
fields. For example, with the POS (Point of Sales) label 
system placed into production processes, it has been desired 
to provide heat sensitive recording materials which are usable 
free of background fogging even at an ambient temperature of 
100 °C and outstanding in the preservability of recorded 
images. Heat sensitive recording materials are generally 
unsatisfactory in the preservation stability of recorded 
images and have the drawback that the recorded images fade in 
a relatively short period of time especially under high-temperature 
conditions. Although use of various preservability 
improving agents has been proposed to improve the preservation 
stability of recorded images, the preservability improving  
 
agents heretofore proposed failed to produce satisfactory 
effects or were found to have another drawback, for example, 
of impairing whiteness even if effective for improving the 
preservability of recorded images under high-temperature 
conditions. Thus satisfactory results still remain to be 
achieved. Accordingly, it is strongly desired to provide a 
heat sensitive recording material having a recording layer 
which does not permit its blank portion to become impaired in 
whiteness even when the material is handled under high-temperature 
conditions, the material further being capable of 
retaining recorded images with good stability. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
heat sensitive recording material which is least likely to 
become impaired in whiteness and record density even when 
exposed to a high temperature of 100 °C . The above and other objects of the invention will 
become apparent from the following description. The present invention provides a heat sensitive 
recording material comprising a recording layer formed on a 
substrate and containing a colorless or light-colored basic 
dye and a color
