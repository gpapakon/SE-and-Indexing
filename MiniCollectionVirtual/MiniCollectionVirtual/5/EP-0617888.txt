<ABSTRACT>
A non-phytotoxic, environmentally compatible composition provides 
improved efficacy against soft-bodied insects and mites. The composition 

comprises a fatty acid salt active ingredient and an adjuvant that surprisingly 
increases the spreadability and efficacy of the active ingredient. The active 

ingredient is a potassium, sodium, ammonium, or alkanolamine salt of one or 
a mixture of monocarboxylic fatty acids having from 8 to 22 carbon atoms. 

The adjuvant can be a fatty alcohol having from 4 to 18 carbon atoms, or a 
methyl or ethyl ester of fatty acids having from 4 to 18 carbon atoms. The 

ratio of the adjuvant to the active ingredient ranges from about 1:0.1 to 1:50.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to pesticidal compositions, particularly those
having insecticidal and miticidal activity, that are formed from
environmentally safe compounds.Fatty acids are naturally occurring, readily biodegradable compounds.
The salts of certain fatty acids are known to have insecticidal and miticidal
properties. Indeed, fatty acid salts having from 8 to 18 carbon atoms,
particularly unsaturated C18 fatty acids, are toxic to many soft bodied insects.Such insecticidal compounds are desirable because their
biodegradability renders them ecologically safe compounds. However, fatty
acid salt insecticides are acute toxins that exhibit no residual activity. To be
effective as a pesticide these compounds must contact target pests. Factors
which influence the effectiveness of such insecticides include the ability of
the compound to effectively spread on a target surface and the ability of the
compound to penetrate the insect's cuticle.Various fatty acid-based pesticidal compositions are disclosed in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,774,234; 4,826,678; and 5,093,124.WO-A-89/10693 discloses arthropodicidal solutions for application on
plants containing mono alpha carboxylic acids of hydrocarbons having
8 to 20 carbon atoms and/or monovalent metal salts thereof. Although
these solutions show a good short time activity they exhibit no
residual activity. GB-A-2,247,621 refers to a herbicidal composition
comprising an aliphatic carboxylic acid, a salt thereof and an
alcohol; the alcohol may be a C1-16-alcohol. Herbicidal activity means
that the composition is capable of retarding the growth of, or
killing, plant life such as herbage and/or undesirable flora. US-A-5,093,124
discloses environmentally safe pesticide solutions wherein
a first component consists of one or a mixture of mono alpha
carboxylic acids of a hydrocarbon having between 8 and 18 carbon
atoms, or an alkali metal salt thereof, and a minor amount of a
phytotoxicity-reducing water soluble material such as lecithin, a
seaweed extract, or a mixture thereof. Fatty alcohols are not soluble in water, therefore these compounds are
not effective for increasing spreading properties of water. Higher fatty
alcohols have been reported to be active against aphids. (See Bosquet et al.
Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, 27:1342-44 (1935). However,
derivatives of fatty alcohols have been used more extensively than fatty
alcohols themselves as pesticides. U.S. Patent Nos. 1,993,040 and 1,963,100
disclose the use of higher alkyl thiocyanates, isothiocyanates,
