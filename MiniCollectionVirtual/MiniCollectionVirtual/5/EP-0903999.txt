<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for heating water and air in a
washing cycle, and air during the drying cycle, and a machine implementing the method.In known household electrical appliances (washing machines) which
during their operating cycle comprise a wash stage with previously heated
water, this heating is achieved by a resistance element housed on the
appliance base.During the wash stage the water is circulated by an appropriate spray
circuit to be raised to the correct temperature by contact with the resistance
element.During drying, current is passed through the resistance element a
number of times for short periods to heat the air and hence dry the crockery.In a first arrangement a traditional armoured resistance element visible
on the appliance base is used.This arrangement has however certain drawbacks, and in particular:
an unpleasant appearance due to the visible resistance element,a reduction in available space due to the presence of this resistance
element,possible water leakage at the points at which the resistance element is fixed
to the dishwasher base,corrosion of the resistance element cladding following contact with
detergents,during drying, possible damage to plastic crockery and containers
positioned in the vicinity of the resistance element, the need for reliable safety devices (thermostats, timers) which control the
resistance operates only for a prefixed time during the drying since lacking
of water could cause irreversible damages to the same resistance.In another type of arrangement, the water is heated by passing it
through a steel or plastic tube provided internally with a resistance element.However this system does not enable the drying stage to be effected
unless additional element are used, such as a cold condensation wall or a
conduit through the air is drawn during drying.The additional elements are costly, their cost being added to the high
cost of the heating tube.FR-A-2.534.438 which discloses all of the features of the first part of claim 1, relates to a heating element for a dishwasher machine
consisting of a plate applied to a hole provided in the bottom of the machine.
To the outer surface of the plate a heating element is applied.US-A-1.983.836 relates to a washing machine in which an electrical
heating unit is provided mounted outside and adjacent the surface of the
machine.All these drawbacks are eliminated according to the invention by a
method for heating water and air in a washing cycle and air during the drying cycle, particularly for domestic
