A method for re-sharpening grinding wheels for a
machine for grinding ophthalmic lenses, comprising one or

several diamond grinding wheels (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), gripping
means (7, 8) designed to received an ophthalmic lens and

control means characterized in that in comprises a step
for detecting wear of the grinding wheel and in that resharpening

is carried out using a disc (9) of an abrasive
material fitted on the grinding machine in the place of

the lens in said gripping means (7, 8) for said lenses.
Method according to claim 1 characterized in that
it further comprises a step for automatically detecting

the presence, nature and/or profile of the disc fitted in
said gripping means.
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the step for detecting the wear of the grinding

wheel consists in measuring the time to machine an
ophthalmic lens.
Method according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in
that the step for detecting the wear of the grinding

wheel consists in measuring the power consumed by the
means for driving the diamond grinding wheel or wheels

(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) in rotation and /or the means for driving
the gripping means (7, 8) in rotation.
The method according to one of claims 1 to 4
characterized in that at least the peripheral surface

(13) of the disc is constituted by an abrasive material,
and in that the disc includes in its central portion (14)

means (15) for providing coupling to the said gripping
means (7, 8) of said machine.
The method according to claim 5, characterized in
that the disc further comprises, at it central portion,

identification means consisting of a plurality of holes
(16a, 16b, 16c).
The method according to claim 5 or 6,
characterized in that said abrasive material consists of

alumina or carborundum. 
A machine for grinding ophthalmic lenses
comprising one or several diamonds grinding wheels,

gripping means designed to receive an ophthalmic lens and
control means for controlling the rotation and the

relative position of said grinding wheels and said lens,
characterized in that it further comprises means for

detecting the need to proceed with resharpening of said
grinding wheel or wheels, said means detecting the need

to proceed with resharpening when the time needed to
machine the lens or the power consumed by the means for

driving said grinding wheel and/or said gripping means
(7, 8) in rotation exceeds a target value.
The machine according to claim 8, characterized
in that it further comprises means for detecting the

possible presence, composition and/or profile of the disc
for re-sharpening said grinding wheels disposed in said

gripping means (7, 8) in the place of said lens.
The machine according to claim 9, characterized
in that said detection means consist of a photoelectric

cell and a light source.
