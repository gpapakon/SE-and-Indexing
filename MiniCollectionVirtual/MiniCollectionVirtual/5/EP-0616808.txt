<ABSTRACT>
This invention refers to the use of the rifamycin antibiotic known by the 
name of rifaximin (INN) and to pharmaceutical compositions containing it 

in the oral treatment of the forms of gastric dyspepsia caused by bacteria 
known as Helicobacter pylori. 
Rifaximin may be administered in any oral pharmaceutical form, 
particularly tablets, capsules, sugar coated tablets, granules and syrups 

containing from 200 to 2000 mg of active principle, at a daily dosage of 
between 400 and 2000 mg.

<DESCRIPTION>
Very recently, in 1983 to be precise, two Australian microbiologists, 
Warren J.R. and Marshall B., Lancet, 1983, 1, 1273-5, identified in 
gastric biopsies from patients affected with gastric dyspepsia some curved 
and spiraliform bacilli which were initially erroneously believed to belong 
to the Campylobacter species. Later, in 1989, Goodwin C.S. et al, Int. J. 
Syst. Bact. 39, 397-405, 1989, made a more precise classification of the 
micro-organism, which had no elements in common with the 
Campylobacter genus, using the name of Helicobacter pylori, deriving 
from the helical form of the bacterium and from its preferred location in 
the pylorus. Marshall B. et al., Med. J. Australia, 142, 436-9, 1985 and 
Morris A., Nicholson G., Am.J. Gastroenterol., 82, 192-9, 1987, 
demonstrated the pathogenic nature of this bacterium which causes 
gastritis in man. Mc Nulty C.A.M. et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 28, (6), 837-8, 
1985 and Shungu D.L. et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 31, (6) 
949-50, 1987, have demonstrated the in vitro activity of numerous 
antibiotics against this bacterium. In particular they demonstrated the vigorous antibacterial in vitro activity 
of beta-lactamic antibiotics: penicillin, ampicillin, cefoxitin and 
imipenem, quinolones: norfloxacin and cyprofloxacin, aminoglycosides: 
gentamicin and erythromycin, and also tetracycline and metronidazole and 
the lack of in vitro activity of other antibacterial agents like sulfa drugs, 
trimethoprim, nalidixic acid. However the proved antibacterial activity in vitro does not automatically 
give the antibacterial agents a therapeutic in vivo activity on Helicobacter 
pylori. Mertens J.C.C. et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 33, (2),  
 
256-7, 1989, in fact clearly demonstrated that norfloxacin, a powerful 
quinolone antibiotic, active in vitro against the bacteria with M.I.C. 90% 
equal to 1 Âµg/ml, is unable to eradicate Helicobacter pylori in 15 out of 
17 patients after a month of treatment. This therapeutic failure, sharply contrasting with the proved in vitro 
activity of norfloxacin against Helicobacter pylori, is attributed both to 
the bacterial resistance, acquired in as many as 9 cases during the 
antibiotic treatment, and to the antibiotic insufficiently penetrating into the 
deeper layers of the gastric mucus harbouring the bacteria. The lack of 
antibacterial action in vivo was further demonstrated by histological data 
and by the symptoms which remained unaltered. It has now been found that rifaximin (INN), an
