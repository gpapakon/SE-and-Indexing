<ABSTRACT>
A two component fibrin-glue composition comprising the components A and B, wherein component A comprises fibrinogen and a protease inhibitor, component B comprises a proteolytic enzyme being capable of cleaving specifically fibrinogen and causing formation of the fibrin polymer and additionally ingredients for culturing embryonic cells of mammals in one or both of the components A and B.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an iso-osmolar two component 
fibrin-glue composition comprising the components A and B 
for improving in vitro fertilization. In 1987 the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) baby was born 
in England. Thereafter, the in vitro fertilization became 
widely used throughout the world. Indications for in vitro 
fertilization include virtually any form of infertility. Since the introduction of IVF the techniques have improved 
in all aspects of this method, for example, induction of 
ovulation, ovum recovery and so on except in one field where 
are still severe problems and complications which is the 
field of implantation of the embryo into the uterus. The 
incidence of implantation of the embryo inside the uterus 
is still 8 to 9 % per embryo or 20 to 30 % rate of 
pregnencies (since 3 to 4 embryos are normally transferred 
in each in vitro fertilization). It can be assumed that the 
transfer of young embryos (2 to 8 cells) to the uterus may 
play an important role in this failure to get higher rate 
of implantations. These embryos are not mature enough for  
 
implantation at this stage. On the other hand culturing the 
embryos outside the uterus for longer time is damaging the 
embryos and only about 30 % of them will develop to the 
blastocyte stadium which is the developmental stage at which 
normal implantation occurs. Attempts for improvement of the 
implantation using a fibrin-glue known in the art failed. 
The idea was to attach the embryo with this fibrin-glue on 
the walls of the uterus (endometrium). EP 0 339 607 discloses a composition for the regeneration 
of articular cartilage and bones by implantation comprising 
cells expressing a chondrocyte phenotype, namely bone marrow 
derived chondrocytes or osteoblasts of autologous or homologous 
origin or homologous committed chondrocytes or autologous 
or homologous muscle fibroblast derived chondroytes 
or any other progenital cells from mesenchymal origin. Such 
cells are embedded in a biodegradable, biocompatible, biological 
resorbable immobilization vehicle consisting of 
fibrinogen, thrombin, CaCl2, protease inhibitor and at least 
10%, preferably 15 - 30% serum. GB 2,102,811 discloses a tissue adhesive and method of 
producing the same. This tissue is based on human or animal 
proteins containing factor XIII, fibrinogen and an antibiotic. 
In order to achieve a high straining capacity of the 
adherences and the retarded antimicrobial efficacy, the ratio 
of factor XIII to fibrinogen expressed in units of fact XIII
