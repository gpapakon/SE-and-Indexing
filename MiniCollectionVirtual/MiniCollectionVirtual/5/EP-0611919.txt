<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for supplying oxygen-containing combustion gas for the combustion of combustible material in the form of separate items, especially rubbish, into a firing chamber with an associated firing grate of an incinerator, in which part of the combustion gas is supplied as a primary gas, at a controlled rate, through the firing grate and the other part of the combustion gas is supplied at least as a secondary gas, at a controlled rate, in at least one stream, and when the combustion gas rate changes, the speed of the secondary gas stream is additionally regulated. In order to adjust the speed of the secondary gas stream to a predetermined momentum of the secondary gas stream when the combustion gas rate changes, the momentum of the secondary gas stream is determined and, when the combustion gas rate changes, the speed of the secondary gas stream is adjusted to a predetermined momentum of the secondary gas stream.
