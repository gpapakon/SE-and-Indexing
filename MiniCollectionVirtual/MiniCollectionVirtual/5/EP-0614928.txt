<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of co-polymers by reacting 
carbon monoxide and one or more ethylenically unsaturated compounds 

under polymerizable conditions in the substantial absence of a 
liquid non-polymerizable diluent and in the presence of a catalyst 

system based on 

(a) a source of cations of one or more noble metals of Group VIII 
of the Periodic Table; 
(b) a source of anions of acids having a pKa of less than 4; 
(c) a source of cations of one of more metals selected from the 
group consisting of nickel, cobalt, manganese, lead, zinc, 

magnesium, iron (II), copper (II), lanthanum and neodymium and 
(d) a source of bidentate ligands.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for the preparation of
co-polymers of carbon monoxide with one or more ethylenically
unsaturated compounds comprising ethene.The preparation of co-polymers of carbon monoxide and one or
more ethylenically unsaturated compounds comprising ethene, in which co-polymers the
units originating from carbon monoxide substantially alternate with
the units originating from the ethylenically unsaturated compounds,
has been described in numerous patent publications.Typically the preparation of the said co-polymers is carried
out as a liquid phase co-polymerization process, whereby the
monomers are contacted with a catalyst composition in the presence
of a liquid non-polymerizable diluent. The formed co-polymers are
isolated, for instance, by filtration or centrifugation. Pure
diluent is recovered from the remaining liquor, suitably by
distillation and can be recycled.A process whereby the polymerization proceeds in solution or
suspension is described e.g. in EP-A-181014. In this process the
monomers react in the presence of a catalyst, being a complex
compound obtained by reaction of a palladium, cobalt or nickel
compound, an anion of a carboxylic acid with a pKa lower than 2,
and a bidentate ligand.Invariably, the anion component of the catalyst composition is
provided as the carboxylic acid.Another liquid phase process for the preparation of the said
co-polymers is described in EP-A-235865. In this process again use
is made of a catalyst composition based on a palladium compound and
a bidentate ligand. However, instead of supplying an acid with a
pKa lower than 2, a non-noble transition metal salt of the relevant
acid is used to form the catalyst composition. It is stated that 
replacement of the acid by the salt in some cases results in a
considerable improvement in catalytic activity of the composition.
Whilst salts of all non-noble transition metals are deemed to be
included, special preference is given to salts of zirconium,
vanadium, chromium, iron, nickel, copper, cerium, thorium and
uranium.It is further known that the preparation of linear,
alternating co-polymers of carbon monoxide and one or more
ethylenically unsaturated compounds can also be carried out in
gas-phase operation. According to EP-A-248483, the gas phase
co-polymerization offers considerable advantages, as regards
reaction rate, molecular weight and bulk density, in comparison
with the liquid phase embodiments of the process. Moreover, the
recovery of the formed co-polymers is simpler, because the
