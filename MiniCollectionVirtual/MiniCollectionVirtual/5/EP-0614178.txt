<ABSTRACT>
A disk player has a magazine for storing disks and a disk transport 
mechanism transporting a selected disk between four positions including an 

eject position, a load position, a playback position, and a store position which 
lie in a single plane. The selected disk is carried on a carriage in a tray from 

the eject position to the load position where the selected disk and carriage are 
partially removed from the tray to the playback position above a disk reader. 

The partial removal of the carriage from the tray to the load position provides 
a required clearance aperture for the disk reader permitting a tray length to be 

minimized. A first transport mechanism transports the tray and carriage 
between said eject and load position. A second transport mechanism transports 

the carriage between the load, playback, and store positions. The first 
transport mechanism enables the second transport mechanism when 

transporting the carriage to the load position. The second transport mechanism 
disables the first transport mechanism and locks the tray at the load position 

when removing a carriage from the load position. The magazine accepts a 
plurality of disks held in carriages. An alignment mechanism provides relative 

movement between the magazine and a plane of transport of the disk transport 
mechanism permitting the selected disk to be inserted or removed from the 

magazine at the store position. The disk reader is positioned to read the 
selected disk overlapping disks stored in the magazine resulting in a smaller 

disk player size. Another embodiment of the invention eliminates the 
magazine and its associated store position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical disk player having a 
magazine for storing disks which permits the playing of selected disks from the 
magazine, and more particularly, to a disk player having a disk reader for 
reading selected disks which are partially withdrawn from the magazine 
thereby permitting a compact construction. Disk players having magazines for storing disks typically provide a 
selecting apparatus for transporting a selected disk from the magazine and 
to a disk reader or an ejection position. One such disk player is disclosed in 
U.S. Patent No. 5,123,001. The disclosed disk player provides carriages for 
holding disks which are transported between independent ejection, playback, 
and storage positions, wherein the storage position has a selected disk 
positioned within the magazine. The disks are arranged in concentrically 
within the magazine and the magazine moves in a first direction perpendicular 
to the disks relative to a disk reader. Disks are transported in a straight line 
in a second direction perpendicular to the first direction. Disks in the 
playback position are completely removed from the magazine and each of the 
positions to which disks are transported, ejection, playback, and storage, are 
distanced from each other. In the above embodiment, the disks are held on carriages within the 
magazine. A selected carriage is transported from within the magazine to a 
playback position outside the magazine where the selected carriage is held on 
a tray. When the carriage holds a selected disk and is in the playback 
position, a disk reader can accept the selected disk for playing. Alternatively,  
 
the tray can then transport the selected carriage to the ejection position outside 
the chassis of the disk player so that the selected disk may be removed from 
the carriage carried by the tray, or, a disk may be inserted into an empty 
carriage carried by the tray The carriage is then transported by the tray to the 
playback position. Once at the playback position, a disk in the carriage is 
played or the carriage is removed from the tray and returned to the magazine. While the above design provides for efficiency in operation, the 
locations of the eject, playback, and storage positions do not permit a compact 
design. The depth 
since transportation of the 
carriage is done in a straight line between three distinct positions. One 
alternative is to position the magazine to the side of the playback position 
instead of in-line with the playback position. This
