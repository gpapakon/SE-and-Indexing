<ABSTRACT>
A heat exchanger includes a heat exchanger 
body (10) from which a connection duct (12) extends. 

The connection duct (12) includes and elastically 
deformable free end and two engaging walls (20) formed 

in respective rectangular apertures (18) proximate the 
free end of the duct (12). A coupling tube (14) for 

coupling the heat exchanger body (10) to a hose of an 
expansion tank includes a first portion (30) 

receivable in the connection duct (12) which includes 
two tangs (34) engageable with the engaging walls (20) 

to secure the coupling tube (14) within the connection 
duct (12), and a second portion (40) connectable to 

the expansion tank hose. A U-shaped recess (22) at 
the free end of the connection tube (12) engages a 

U-shaped locating portion (50) of the coupling tube 
(14) to align the coupling tube relative to the heat 

exchanger body (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heat 
exchanger including a separate coupling tube for 
coupling the heat exchanger to a hose leading to an 
expansion tank. It is known in heat exchangers used in 
vehicle radiators to have a removable coupling tube 
coupled between a port of the heat exchanger and a 
hose leading to an expansion tank. The coupling tube 
may be secured to the expansion tank by means, for 
example, of a bayonet fitting or of a snap-fit 
arrangement whereby lugs on the tube engage the 
opening of the heat exchanger. The present invention seeks to provide an 
improved heat exchanger. According to an aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a heat exchanger as 
specified in claim 1. The claimed arrangement can provide an 
improved connection between an expansion tank hose and 
a heat exchanger. Preferably, a connection duct of the heat 
exchanger includes one or more elongate slots 
extending from the free end of the connection duct. 
Such slots can add elasticity to the free end of the 
connection duct to assist in fitting and removing the 
coupling tube to the connection duct. In an embodiment, the connection duct 
includes one or more apertures, the or each aperture 
including the or a respective engaging wall. 
Preferably, two apertures are provided, disposed 
substantially opposite one another relative to the 
connection duct. Advantageously, the connection duct includes 
a location recess extending from the free end of the 
connection duct, the coupling tube including a  
 
location portion receivable in the recess. The recess 
and location portion ensure that the coupling tube and 
hence the expansion chamber hose are given a 
predetermined orientation relative to the heat 
exchanger, which can be very important in the confined 
space in a vehicle. Preferably, the location recess in the 
connection duct and the location portion of the 
coupling tube are substantially U-shaped. This shape 
facilitates insertion and orientation of the coupling 
tube in the connection duct. An elastomeric seal may be disposed in an 
annular groove proximate an end of the first portion 
of a coupling tube of the heat exchanger, the 
elastomeric seal co-operating with the internal 
surface of the connection duct to provide a 
fluid-tight seal between the connection duct and the 
coupling tube. Preferably, the internal surface of the 
connection duct includes a greater diameter portion at 
the free end of the connection duct and a smaller 
diameter portion at the end of the connection duct
