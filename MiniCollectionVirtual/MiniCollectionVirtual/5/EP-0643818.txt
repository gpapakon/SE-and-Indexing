<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor oven (10) for cooking food products using infrared radiation includes upper and lower etched foil heater (38 and 40) which are disposed above and below the upper flight of a conveyor belt (36) passing therethrough. The oven also includes a controller (18) for governing the speed of the belt (36), the time of exposure to infrared radiation, and a range of radiation wavelength between about 4 and 5 microns for cooking food in the oven (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
 INFRARED CONVEYOR OVENField of the InventionThis invention relates to infra-red ovens and primarily to commercial ovens which are compact in design and intended for rapid cooking of a variety of different food items.Background of the InventionIn smaller commercial establishments, it is often desirable to provide food warmers for the display of food whereby individual orders may be placed for specific items displayed. It has now become feasible to cook food items to order in such establishments utilizing infra-red energy.Infra-red energy is particularly suited for smaller commercial establishments because the energy produced is directional and production does not involve cooking does not require heated air currents which may be released into the ambient atmosphere as with convection ovens and the like. While microwave ovens are also useful in such establishments, microwave ovens have distinct disadvantages relative to the inability to brown bread or rolls and to char the exterior while cooking meat. Microwave ovens, however, are compact and suitable for countertop use.In U.S. Patent No. 4,960,977, assigned to the assignee of this invention, there was described a 

 countertop-type infra-red radiation oven useful, for example, to cook pizza wherein the article to be cooked was disposed upon a mesh turntable. Infra-red emitters were disposed below and above the item to be cooked and on two of its four sides. Accordingly, as the turntable rotated, all sides of the food product were exposed to radiation for cooking.In the case of pizza, the sides, bottom, and top all may have different cooking requirements. In the above-identified infra-red oven, the emitters were separately controlled. In addition, the top emitter was disposed in a movable shroud which could be adjusted in height over the turntable as desired. Shielding for the oven was not necessary because convection currents were not involved in the cooking process and only the directional radiation of the emitters used.This type of oven was particularly suited to the use of etched foil emitters as contrasted to the use of conventional quartz tubes, nichrome wire and the like. The foil emitters use a relatively low wattage, have a rapid warm-up and cool-down, and can be adjusted to the desired medium range wavelength of cooking energy. In addition, a ceramic or other type shield is not necessary.In certain infra-red emitters such as that described in U.S. Patent No. 3,809,859, a refractory cover is provided over the wire heating elements, which cover

Claims
1. A compact, countertop type conveyor oven comprising: a housing defining a cooking chamber having an inlet and an outlet; a conveyor belt extending through the chamber and through the inlet and outlet and drive means therefor; support arms mounted on said housing at the inlet and outlet for supporting that portion of said conveyor belt extending therefrom; top and bottom infra-red heating elements mounted within said chamber a predetermined distance above and below the upper flight of that portion of the conveyor belt disposed in said chamber each element contained in a plane disposed parallel to the upper flight and spaced a predetermined distance therefrom, said elements substantially covering that portion of the flight disposed within said chamber, said elements being etched foil heaters; and control means coupled to said oven for controlling the speed of travel of the conveyor belt through said chamber and the wavelength of the infra-red radiation generated and time of exposure thereto within the chamber to control the range of the wavelength generated between about 4-5 microns by interrupting the operation of said heaters.
2. The oven of claim 1 wherein the heaters have the capacity of about 7-8 watts power per square inch of surface area.
3. The oven of claim 1 wherein the conveyor belt is only about 18 inches wide.
4. The oven of claim 3 wherein the upper heater element is disposed about 3-4 inches above the plane containing the upper flight of said conveyor belt. 


 5. The oven of claim 4 wherein the lower heater element is disposed about 1 1/2 inches below the plane containing the upper flight of said conveyor.
6. The oven of claim 1 wherein said control means in sequence advances said belt into said chamber, stops for a predetermined period of time and then advances said belt again through said chamber so that a food product thereon is indexed into the chamber for a predetermined period of time to cook it and then advanced through the outlet so that it can be replaced in the chamber with another food product to be cooked.
7. The oven of claim 1 wherein said control means advances said belt continuously at a predetermined speed proportional to the residence time of an incremental portion of said conveyor belt within the cooking chamber.
8. The oven of claim 1 wherein the depth of said oven in the direction of said parallel planes is no more than about 24 inches.
9. The oven of claim 8 wherein the inlet and outlets have rectangular dimensions of about 3 by 19 1/2 inches.
10. The oven of claim 1 further comprising optical indicator means for indicating when a food product is disposed on said conveyor at the inlet to said chamber.
