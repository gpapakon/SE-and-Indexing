<ABSTRACT>
An overhead mounted door holder assembly (10) for 
attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door (12), to 

hold the door in an open position, includes a jamb bracket 
(16) attached to the door jamb and a jamb arm (18) 

pivotally attached to the jamb bracket. A-channel assembly 
(22) having a longitudinally extending channel (23) is 

attached to the door, and first and second end caps (24, 
25) are attachable to opposing ends of the channel 

assembly, with each end cap being held by a retaining key 
(60, 61) in locked connection with the channel assembly. 

The first and second end caps are configured to allow 
alternate positioning of the channel assembly inset in a 

top of the door or attached to a side of the door. A hold 
open stop (28) is held in the channel of the channel 

assembly. The hold open stop has a stop element (38) for 
engaging a slide assembly pivotally attached to the jamb 

arm and positioned for longitudinal movement in the 
channel. The slide assembly engages the stop element of 

the hold open stop and holds the door in an open position. 
The force required to engage the hold open stop and the 

slide assembly is determined by the position of an 
adjustment wedge (46).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to overhead door holders 
and, more particularly, to an adjustable overhead mounted 
door holder assembly configured for optional mounting 
either in a door top inset or on the door face parallel to 
a top edge of the door. Temporarily holding a door in an open position is sometimes 
required for convenience and safety. One common method 
uses an overhead mounted door control device that includes 
a pivoting arm attached between an upper portion of the 
door jamb and an upper part of the door. When the door is 
to be held open at an angle less than about 110 degrees, an 
overhead mounted door control device is efficient, 
effective, convenient to install and maintain, less subject 
to damage by vandalism or accidents and does not present a 
potential stumbling hazard. Commonly, a door holder is inset into the top of the door 
or alternatively attached to the face of the door. It 
should be set to permit easy engagement, to hold the door 
against minor amounts of jostling contact without release 
and yet to still permit closing the door without undue 
effort. It is also very desirable that the door holder is 
designed to be adjusted or replaced with minimal effort and 
expertise. Large easily manipulated locking elements that 
hold together the assembly are preferable to small diameter 
pins or other fastening means that require special tools or 
coordination. According to one aspect of the present invention, there is 
provided an adjustable overhead mounted door holder 
assembly, for attachment between a door jamb and a door for 
selectively holding the door in an open position,  
 
comprising a jamb bracket attached to the door jamb; a jamb 
arm pivotally attached to the jamb bracket; a channel 
assembly having a channel therein, a slide assembly 
positioned for movement in the channel, the slide assembly 
being pivotally attached to the jamb arm, characterised in 
that first and second end caps are attachable to opposing 
ends of the channel assembly, each end cap being held by a 
retaining key in locked connection with the channel 
assembly and the end caps are configured to- allow 
positioning of the channel assembly inset in a top of the 
door or attached to a face of the door. According to a second aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a door holder assembly, for attachment 
between a door jamb and a door, comprising means for 
pivotally attaching a jamb arm to a door; a channel 
assembly for attachment to the door, characterised by means

<CLAIMS>
An adjustable overhead mounted door holder assembly 
(10), for attachment between a door jamb (14) and a door 

(12) for selectively holding the door in an open position, 
comprising a jamb bracket (16) attached to the door jamb 

(14); a jamb arm (18) pivotally attached to the jamb 
bracket (16); a channel assembly (22) having a channel (23) 

therein, a slide assembly (26) positioned for movement in 
the channel, the slide assembly being pivotally attached to 

the jamb arm, characterised in that first and second end 
caps (24, 25) are attachable to opposing ends of the 

channel assembly (22), each end cap being held by a 
retaining key (60, 61) in locked connection with the 

channel assembly and the end caps are configured to allow 
positioning of the channel assembly (22) inset in a top of 

the door or attached to a face of the door. 
An assembly according to claim 1 and further 
comprising a hold open stop (28) positioned to engage the 

slide assembly (26) for temporarily preventing movement of 
the sliding element to hold the door in an open position 

and wherein the first end cap (24) further comprises a 
notch (34) for attachment to the hold open stop. 
An assembly according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
retaining keys (60, 61) are in the form of substantially 

flat plates configured to fit into respective notches (62, 
63) in the channel assembly (22).
