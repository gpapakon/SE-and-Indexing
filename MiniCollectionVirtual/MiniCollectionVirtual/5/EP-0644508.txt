<ABSTRACT>
Card (30) includes a substrate (32) which has disposed thereon 
for secure identification 

a diffraction grating strip (34) comprising a pattern of a series 
of diffraction grating elements (40A-D), each 

said diffraction grating element (40A-D) to diffract light, from a 
light source, in one of at least three selected different 

planes; serially illuminating said diffraction grating 
elements (40A-D), detecting changes in plane of diffracted light as 

said diffraction grating elements (40A-D) are serially illuminated, 
and generating first information representative of said 

changes in plane; storing said first information 
representative of said changes in plane; subsequently, 

serially illuminating said diffraction grating elements (40A-D), 
detecting changes in plane of diffracted light as said 

diffraction grating elements (40A-D) are serially illuminated, and 
generating second information representative of said changes 

in plane; and then, comparing the first and second 
information to determine the authenticity or not of said 

article. 
 
In a further aspect of the application, a coded pattern 
is placed on said diffraction grating strip, with one of said 

coded pattern and said pattern of diffraction grating 
elements precessing with respect to the other and the coded 

pattern is read, stored, and compared as part of said first 
and second information, as above.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to secure identification
generally and, more particularly, but not by way of
limitation, to unique identification method and means that
that employ a compound diffraction grating strip.Identification has become increasingly more important
in a variety of settings. For example, employee
identification cards may be used to gain access to security
areas of a facility and/or in time and attendance
reporting. Drivers' licenses are often used to verify the
identification of the possessors thereof. Various types of
credit and debit cards are employed to make purchases,
obtain cash or traveler's checks, and/or to transfer funds,
for example. In all of these settings, forgery and copying
of such identification means result in the compromising of
secret information and the loss of hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of merchandise and cash annually. In many
cases, credit card type identification is verified at the
point of sale; however, as the need for more unattended
credit card use expands, there is a greater need to verify
the authenticity of the credit card to which the transaction
is being charged. One of the major methods used by forgers of credit
cards is to obtain the numbers encoded on a valid credit
card during a legitimate transaction and, at a later time,
to include this number on another credit card. When the
forged credit card is subsequently used on a transaction,
the charge is applied to the valid number and the account of
the owner of the valid credit card is charged accordingly.
The only way to prevent this type of theft is to computer
validate each transaction as the purchase is taking place
and to have a cashier check the identification of the person
purchasing the items against the name returned by the
validation computer. While this procedure is economically
justifiable when the purchase is for a relatively large
amount and there is a cashier present, it is impossible to
use this method for small transactions such as with vending
machines, pay telephones, transit charges, automatic teller
machines, and a host of other unattended charge
applications.There have also been elaborate attempts to create
graphic patterns embellished with holographic photographic
images to prevent forged credit cards from easily being
produced. However, with today's high-tech criminal element,
credit cards and holographic images can be illegally
produced and sold at high profits. In addition, this method 
of security still depends on the human element to inspect the card and identify
