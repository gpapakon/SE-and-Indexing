<ABSTRACT>
A moisture-permeable waterproof fabric comprising a fiber fabric coated, on at least one side thereof, with a 
fluorinated polyurethane resin and a low-polymerization polyurethane resin. The fabric is produced by coating at least 

one side thereof with a solution of both the resins, followed by coagulation, solvent removal, drying and treatment 
with a water repellent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a moisture-permeable,
waterproof fabric and a process for its production. More
particularly, the present invention relates to a water-permeable,
waterproof fabric having high moisture
permeability and water resistance, as well as excellent
washing durability and inhibition of moisture condensation.A known fabric having both water and oil repellency, as
well as desoiling properties, is disclosed in EP-A-0231927.
The fabric is treated with a compound comprising at least two
terminal segments and an intermediate segment connecting the
terminal segments. The intermediate segment has a molecular
weight of 800 - 20,000 and is a urethane oligomer containing
a hydrophilic molecular chain and at least two -CONH- linking
groups connecting to the respective terminal segments. The
terminal segments each contain at least one perfluoralkyl
group.Known processed fabrics having moisture permeability and
water resistance consist of a coating of a polyurethane resin
on a fabric and have cells formed in the resin coating, by
wet coagulation, as disclosed in JP-A-58-144178.However, because moisture permeability and water
resistance are reciprocal functions, in the above-mentioned
prior art where the coating is a polyurethane resin, it is
difficult to improve both functions. For example, when the
moisture permeability was set at 4,000 g/m2/24 hours, it was
not possible to obtain a processed fabric having a water
resistance pressure of 2,000 mmH2O.In order to improve this performance, the use of a film
of a mixture of polyurethane resin and polyamino acid-modified
urethane resin which was wet coagulated after mixing
is proposed in, for example, JP-A-60-173178. According to 
this proposal, a processed fabric is obtained having moisture
permeability of at least 7,000 g/m2/24 hours and a water
resistance pressure of at least 1,500 mmH2O.In addition, the use of a film of a mixture of
fluororesin copolymer, composed of fluororubber for the base
polymer, and polyurethane resin which was wet coagulated
after mixing is proposed in, for example, 
JP-A-02-099671. According to this proposal, a processed
fabric is obtained having a moisture permeability of 9,000-13,000
g/m2/24 hours and a water resistance pressure of at
least 1,500 mmH2O.However, in the technology which uses a resin coating
composed by mixing the above-mentioned polyamino acid
denatured urethane resin and polyurethane resin, although
moisture permeability is 4,000-10,000 g/m2/24 hours, water
resistance pressure is of the order of
