<ABSTRACT>
A protective hat (10) for children and adults comprises a 
head-enveloping member (12) constructed of a core (20,28,30) of impact 

absorbent foam, encapsulated within a shell (50,52,54,56) of textile 
fabric material, the textile fabric material providing 

the inner and outer surfaces of the hat. The core is so 
constructed as to provide for conformity to the shape of 

head of the wearer, and to allow for ventilation. The 
bulk and density of the foam core is such that, in sizes 

for children, the hat provides significant buoyancy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to protective
headwear, and more specifically, to protective hats
suitable for use by children, adolescents and adults.Numerous kinds of protective headwear have
heretofore been proposed. Such headwear includes, for
example, the protective helmet disclosed in
US-A-3,171,133, and is often quite unconventional in
appearance and objectionable for that reason alone.Attempts have been made to provide combined dress
and protective headwear, usually for children. For
example, in US-A-2,717,384, there is disclosed a
combined dress and protective hat including a circular
cap, constructed over a cruciform framework of
protective elements. This device, too, differs greatly
in appearance from conventional headgear, and reveals
itself at once to be a specially constructed protective
device.WO 93/13683 discloses a protective cap having a
hemispherical head shell formed by radially arranged
segmented panels. Each panel consists of a fabric
pocket containing a shock absorbent pad, the panels
being separated from adjacent panels by flexible fold
lines.In US-A-4,581,773,
comprising the futures of the preamble of claim 1
there are disclosed two
embodiments of a protective hat specifically intended
for infants and toddlers, and which provides a 
conventional and unobjectional appearance, while also
comfortably providing a protective function. Such a hat
is constructed using components made up of cores of
resilient shock absorbent foam material, encapsulated in
fabric shells.In attempting to apply the principles of
US-A-4,581,773 to protective hats for larger sizes, such
as for children four years of age and older, adolescents
and adults, it has been found that simply enlarging the
hat and providing thicker foam is not a practical
solution. On the contrary, it has been found that use
of core elements in excess of about 9.5 mm (3/8 inch) in
thickness produces a hat difficult to shape to the head
of a wearer, which is uncomfortable to wear due to poor
ventilation, and which is difficult to fabricate. There
is a need, therefore, to provide an easily manufactured
protective hat which is suitable for use by older
children, adolescents and adults.In one aspect, the present invention provides a
protective hat having shock absorptive and insulating
properties, comprising a head-receiving member adapted
to overlie and protect at least the sides, top and rear
of the head of a wearer, said head-receiving member
comprising an arcuate member adapted to partly encircle
the head of a wearer,
from the region

<CLAIMS>
A hat having shock absorptive and insulating
properties, comprising a head-receiving member (12)

adapted to overlie and protect at least the sides, top
and rear of the head of a wearer, said head-receiving

member (12) comprising an arcuate member (14) adapted to
partly encircle the head of a wearer

from the region above the eyes, over the head and down to the
nape of the neck,

and two
closure members (16,18)

which protect at least the ears of the wearer,
said closure members

(16,18) having edge portions (16',18') thereof
complementary with and fixedly coupled to respective

edge portions (14') of said arcuate member (14) so that
said arcuate (12) and said closure members

(16,18) define a concavity adapted to receive the head
of a wearer, said arcuate (14) and closure (16,18)

members each comprising a core (20,28,30) of resilient
shock absorbent polymeric foam material and a shell of

textile fabric material, said shell (50,52,54,56) being
so constructed and arranged as to fully enclose and

encapsulate said core (20,28,30) so that said hat has a
conventional appearance and surface texture,

characterised in that said core (20,28,30) has a
plurality of generally arcuate slits (24,36,38,40)

therethrough to facilitate conformity of said core
(20,28,30) to the shape of the head of a wearer and to

facilitate ventilation of said concavity.
A hat according to claim 1 wherein said core
(20,28,30) has a plurality of spaced holes (22,32)

therethrough distributed over the surface of said core
(20,28,30) to facilitate ventilation of said concavity.
A hat according to claim 2 wherein at least some of
said holes (22,32) are arranged in arcuate rows, said

slits (24,36,38,40) being disposed between said rows of
holes (22,32). 
A hat according to any preceding claim, wherein said
core (20,28,30) of resilient material has a thickness of

about 9.5 to 25 mm (3/8 to about 1 inch).
A hat according to any of claims 2 to 4, wherein
some of said holes (22,32) in said core (20,28,30), are

so disposed as to overlie the ear of a wearer, at least
one of said slits (36,38,40) being so shaped as to in

part surround the ear of a wearer to facilitate
conformity of said side piece to the shape of the side

of the head of a user.
A hat according to any preceding claim, wherein said
core (20) of said arcuate member (14) has a central

opening (22'), some of said slits (24) being disposed
around said central opening (22').
A hat according to claim 6, wherein at least some of

said slits (24) extend radially from said central
opening (22').
A hat according to any preceding claim, wherein said
hat is provided with a chin strap (68).
