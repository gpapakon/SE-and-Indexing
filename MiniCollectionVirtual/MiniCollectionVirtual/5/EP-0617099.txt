<ABSTRACT>
There has always been a need to reduce friction 
and drag forces while cleaning surfaces with automated 

equipment. Acidic compositions of the present 
invention are suitable for crystallizing calcium 

carbonate-containing surfaces with reduced drag and 
increase gloss of the surface. The compositions 

comprise an oxygenated organic compound, a metal 
hexafluorosilicate, and water. Systems for 

crystallizing calcium carbonate-containing surfaces, 
and methods of using the systems, are also described, 

the systems comprising the compositions of the 
invention and a surface treating article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The subject of this invention is the inclusion of 
an organic solvent in an aqueous composition used for 
crystallizing a calcium carbonate-containing surface 
such as a marble floor in combination with an abrasive 
article. Crystallization is a term used in the marble 
flooring industry to designate a process for improving 
the durability of marble. An aqueous acidic solution 
of a fluorosilicate salt such as magnesium 
hexafluorosilicate is applied to the surface, followed 
by buffing the wetted area with a steel wool pad under 
a rotary floor machine. One theory is that the 
friction-induced heating of the floor combined with the 
presence of the iron in the steel wool pad causes a 
chemical reaction to occur at the calcium carbonate-containing 
surface, changing the calcium carbonate of 
the surface into a calcium fluoride species. Calcium 
fluorides are more durable to wear, more stain 
resistant, and glossier than the original calcium 
carbonate-containing surface. A discussion of the 
crystallization process and the materials typically 
used was incorporated into assignee's U.S. Patent 
Patent No. 5,282,900. In the above-referenced patent, a particular 
nonwoven abrasive pad composition was found to be 
effective as the buffing pad for the crystallization 
process even though it had no iron content. It was 
argued that the industry considers nonwoven articles 
which are not formed from steel wool (i.e., do not 
contain iron) to be non-effective for crystallization 
of calcium carbonate-containing floors such as marble 
floors. It was thus surprising to the inventors to 
find a non-iron containing nonwoven pad construction  
 
which could be used with commonly used crystallization 
chemical such as acidic solutions of metal 
hexafluorosilicates to create the durable, glossy 
surface previously considered to be achievable only 
with the steel wool pads. U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,876 describes the use of a 
glycol ether in a primer composition which is applied 
to a marble surface before the crystallization 
chemical. While there is ample documentation of 
crystallization chemical compositions containing metal 
hexafluorosilicate salts, water and adjuvant chemicals 
such as surfactants or wax emulsions, there is no 
documentation the inventors are aware of for the 
inclusion of an oxygenated organic compound in the 
crystallization chemical. This is rather surprising 
since hard surface cleaning chemicals and floor 
coatings have long been prepared with water and 
oxygenated organic compounds, as well as
