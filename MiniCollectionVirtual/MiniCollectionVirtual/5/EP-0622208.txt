<ABSTRACT>
An ink jet printer (10) includes a movable carriage (12) supported above an ink-receiving 
medium (24) by a 
rail (14) defining a carriage axis, with a cartridge holder 
(16) mounted on said carriage having a plurality of cartridge compartments (18) each 

receiving a respective thermal ink jet printer cartridge (20). Each cartridge is provided 
with three datum surfaces (54, 56, 58) located on the perimeter of a sidewall of the 

cartridge, and sufficiently spaced apart from each other and from the center of gravity 
of the cartridge to provide accurate and stable alignment. More particularly, the 

nozzle plate (30) of the cartridge is attached to a lower surface of snout portion (74) 
such that the Y axis of the nozzle plate is substantially parallel to the first sidewall, with 

the first and second datum surfaces (54, 56) at the front and rear of a lower end of 
the ink reservoir portion (70) straddling the snout and the third datum surface (58) at 

an upper end of the ink reservoir portion. At least the first and second datum 
surfaces are spaced from the Y axis within a predetermined tolerance by a first 

predetermined spacing. The cartridge is also provided with a forwardly facing fourth 
datum surface (44) on a lower end of the ink reservoir portion in front of the snout 

portion, and with a downwardly facing fifth datum (40) surface on the perimeter wall 
(64) of the ink reservoir portion adjacent the fourth datum surface and above said 

snout portion, so as to establish a pivot axis above and in front of the snout, and with 
a rearwardly facing sixth datum (46) surface on an upper end of the ink reservoir 

portion of said perimeter wall. The fourth datum surface is spaced from the X axis of  
 

the nozzle plate within a predetermined tolerance, while the locations of the fifth datum 
surface (which is used to determine the spacing of the nozzle to the print medium) 

and the sixth datum surfaces (which is used to determine angular orientation of the 
cartridge about the pivot point) are somewhat less critical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to inkjet
printers having multiple printing cartridges each having its
own nozzle assembly and ink reservoir, and more particularly
to a cartridge datum scheme for ensuring accurate and stable
alignment of the cartridges when installed in a printer having
a multiple compartment cartridge holder. From US 4 755 836 it is known to provide an inkjet printer with a pair
of replaceable printing cartridges (each having at least one nozzle assembly
and associated ink reservoir) mounted on a common carriage, and to
maintain registration between the cartridges and the carriage by means of
alignment and registration features such as protuberances, shims, opening
and surfaces. A latch mechanism provides a loading force in all three
coordinate axes and cooperates with the registration and alignment features
to prevent pitch, yaw and roll of the cartridge.That prior art registration and latching system was designed for use
with two relatively wide cartridges (one containing three colors of ink, each
in a separate ink reservoir and applied by a separate set of ink nozzles), and
located all the alignment and registration feature in the vicinity of the nozzle
plate assembly. Because it was relatively wide and short, the prior art
cartridge could be maintained in a predetermined spatial orientation within
reasonable limits without imposing exceedingly tight tolerances on the
locations of the various alignment and registrations features, and had
sufficient stability to maintain the cartridge in that predetermined spatial
orientation, even when subjected to sideways inertial forces when the
carriage was accelerated or decelerated; however, especially if used with
more than two cartridges, the prior art design would result in a printer
having a wide footprint, and is not readily adaptable for use with four
relatively tall and narrow cartridges.From US 4 872 026 it is known to facilitate the installation of a single
inkjet cartridge by providing a lower pivot below an electrical interface,
adjacent the intersection of the contact and nozzle planes, with the cartridge
being held in its installed position by an upper latch spring. Although that 
design is intended to provide some wiping action between the electrical
contacts as the cartridge is loaded into position, such wiping is relatively
minimal because of the close proximity of the pivot point to the contact
plane. Moreover, because the pivot of the prior art design had to cooperate
with a corresponding supporting structure on the
