<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to devices
for cleaning storage tanks. In particular, the present
invention is related to devices for removing oil and
other sludge that accumulates in crude oil storage or
process tanks.The accumulation of sludge in crude oil
storage tanks and other liquid storage tanks is a
problem faced by many companies and municipalities
around the world that store crude oil before it is
refined. Oil storage tanks must be cleaned periodically
by manned crews usually shoveling out the sludge which
accumulates on the bottom of the tank.Cleaning oil or other liquid storage tanks is
presently an arduous and hazardous task. As many as 15
or 20 people may be placed inside a tank to clean the
sludge from the tank by hand and prepare the tank with
hand tools for inspection or repair.Placing workmen in a storage tank is very
dangerous due to the flammability and volatility of oil
and other liquids commonly stored in large tanks.
Workers commonly must wear self-contained breathing
equipment because the fumes from the chemicals stored in
the tanks would suffocate or be toxic to the worker.Commonly the access ports in the great
majority of storage tanks are circular hatches or
manholes which are commonly 61 cm (24 inches) in diameter. The
size of the access port limits the size of any equipment
used by the worker in cleaning the interior of a tank. The following patents disclose art related to
the present invention:U. S. Patent 4,770,711 discloses a method for
cleaning chemical sludge deposits of oil storage tanks
with a fluidizing agent, the tank having a floor, a side
wall and a passageway through the side wall positioned
adjacent the floor of the tank comprises a frame having
a central portion and first and second end portions.
The frame is configured and dimensioned to pass through
the passageway. A pair of independently movable endless
chain belts are position on opposite sides of the frame
for selectively moving the frame within the oil storage
tank to selected locations. A hydraulic line coupled to
the central portion of the frame discharges the
fluidizing agent onto an adjacent first portion of the
sludge deposit so as to form a pool of sludge and
fluidizing agent. A suction pump is positioned on the
central portion of the frame for drawing up the poll of
sludge and fluidizing agent.
A
plurality of nozzles disposed adjacent the first end
portion of the frame are in fluid communication with the
suction pump so as to provide pressurized agitation and
discharging of the pool of sludge and

<CLAIMS>
A movable oil and oil sludge removal apparatus (10)
insertable into the
 manhole (82) of a crude oil storage tank
(83) comprising platform means (12), pump means (18)

connected to said platform means (12) for pumping sludge
(21a) out of said tank (83), motor means (26,28) connected to

track assembly means (14) for driving said track
assembly means, and means (70,72) for contacting said sludge

(21a) and forcing said sludge to said pump means (18)
characterized by comprising track assembly means (14)

pivotally connected to said platform means (12) for
supporting said platform means (12) which track assembly

means (14) can be pivoted on said platform means (12) to fold
under said platform means (12).
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said pump means
(18) has an intake means (21) for receiving said sludge and a

discharge means (20) for discharging sludge from said pump
means.
The apparatus of claim 2, wherein hose means (20a)
is connected to said discharge means to convey said pumped

sludge from said tank.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said track
assembly means comprise two track assemblies (16,17) each of

which is adapted to fold beneath said platform means.
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein hydraulic ram
means (84,85) are connected to said track means and said

platform means to selectively pivot said track means beneath
said platform means.
The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said hydraulic
ram means have hydraulic hoses (85a,85b) attached thereto for

selectively actuating said hydraulic ram means which extend
outside of said tank.
The apparatus of claim 4, wherein said motor means
is a hydraulic motor (18).
The apparatus of claim 5, wherein said hydraulic 
motor has hydraulic hoses (18a,18b) attached thereto for

selectively actuating said hydraulic motor which extend
outside of said tank.
The apparatus of claim 1, wherein said means for
contacting said sludge means comprises rotatable auger means

(70,72).
A method for removing sludge from an oil storage
tank (83) having a manhole (82) comprising:


a. providing a sludge removal apparatus (10) having
a pump (18) pivotally connected to two motor driven tacks

(16,17),
b. pivoting said two tracks beneath said pump to
enable said sludge removal apparatus to be inserted into said

manhole,
c. inserting said sludge removal apparatus through
said manhole into said tank,
d. pivoting said tracks outward from beneath said
pump,
