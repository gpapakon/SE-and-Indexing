<ABSTRACT>
A voice processing technique, that may be implemented as an algorithm or logic 
or a method, that electronically determines if a digitized sound source contains a voice 

signal component at periodic instances in time. The present invention uses spectral 
estimation techniques combined with statistical analysis and discrete decision logic to 

determine a voice or no-voice decision. The present invention uses a measurement of 
standard deviation of each energy band combined with a neural network to determine 

which bands may be used to detect voice modulation. Second-order statistics are used 
to determine which energy bands are most reliable for detection of a voice signal. The 

neural network is used to make the decision based on past values of these statistics. In 
addition, the voice decision logic controls the gain of its microphone input to provide a 

superior automatic gain control microphone. The present invention updates the AGC 
gain only during voice modulation. The present invention operates in noisy environments 

while maintaining high accuracy, resulting in very few false activations. The 
present invention adapts to the ambient noise level automatically, eliminating the need 

for a manual level control. The present invention makes decisions quickly, reducing 
problems associated with chopping off the beginning of words. The present invention 

controls the AGC function, and this control eliminates the effects of runaway gain 
when no voice signal is present, saturation when the circuit is reactivated, and also 

ensures consistent gain with speech containing long pauses between phrases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to automatic gain control (AGC) circuits 
and processing methods, and more particularly, to a voice activated transmission 
coupled automatic gain control circuit and processing method. A number of voice activated transmission (VOX) algorithms and circuits have 
been proposed over the past few years. It is believed that none of them has used a 
measurement of standard deviation of each energy band combined with a neural 
network to determine which bands may be used to detect voice modulation. Updating 
the AGC gain only during voice modulation is also not found in prior VOX systems. Conventional voice activated transmission (VOX) algorithms and circuits are 
described in "The ARRL Handbook for the Radio Amateur", published by the American 
Radio Relay League, Sixty-sixth Edition, 1989. Conventional VOX circuitry and 
VOX bias control is generally described in Chapter 12 at page 12-24 and 12-25. The 
voice operate switch (VOX) and its future trends are generally discussed in Chapter 13 
at pages 13-11 and 13-12, while a drawing illustrating a basic VOX system is shown 
on page 13-9. Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a voice activated 
transmission (VOX) circuit and processing method that uses a measurement of standard 
deviation of each energy band combined with a neural network to determine which  
 
bands may be used to detect voice modulation. It is a further objective of the present 
invention to provide a voice activated transmission (VOX) circuit and processing 
method that updates AGC gain during voice modulation. The present invention is a voice processing technique, that may be implemented 
as an algorithm or logic or a process, that electronically determines if a digitized sound 
source contains a voice signal component at periodic instances in time. The present 
invention uses spectral estimation techniques combined with statistical analysis and 
discrete decision logic to determine a voice or no-voice decision. The present invention 
uses a measurement of standard deviation of each energy band combined with a neural 
network to determine which bands may be used to detect voice modulation. While 
there have been algorithms designed to perform this task using averaging, the present 
invention uses second-order statistics to determine which energy bands are most 
reliable for detection of a voice signal. The neural network is used to make the decision 
based on past values of these statistics. In addition, the voice decision
