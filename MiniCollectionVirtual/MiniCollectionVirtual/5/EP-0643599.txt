<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for delivering an agent 
transdermally or transmucosally by iontophoresis. More particularly, 
this invention relates to an electrically powered iontophoretic 
delivery device having electrodes which can be hydrated or otherwise 
activated by the addition of liquid just before applying the device 
to the body. Iontophoresis has in the past been defined as "the 
introduction, by means of electric current, of ions of soluble salts 
into the tissues of the body for therapeutic purposes." 
Iontophoretic devices for delivering ionized drugs through the skin 
have been known since the early 1900's. Deutsch UK Patent No. 
410,009 (1934) describes an iontophoretic device which overcame one 
of the disadvantages of such early devices, namely that the patient 
needed to be immobilized near the source of electric current. The 
Deutsch device was powered by a galvanic cell formed from the 
electrodes and the material containing the drug to be delivered 
transdermally. The galvanic cell produced the current necessary for 
iontophoretically delivering the drug. This device thus allowed the 
patient to move around during iontophoretic drug delivery and thus 
imposed substantially less interference with the patient's daily 
activities. Today, iontophoresis is not limited solely to the delivery of 
ions (e.g., drug ions) into the body by means of electric current. 
For example, it is now recognized that iontophoretic delivery devices 
can be used to deliver an uncharged drug or agent into the body. 
This is accomplished by a process called electroosmosis. 
Electroosmosis is the transdermal flux of a liquid solvent (e.g., the 
liquid solvent containing the uncharged drug or agent) which is  
 
induced by the presence of an electric field imposed across the skin 
by the donor electrode. As used herein, the terms "iontophoresis" 
and "iontophoretic" refer to (1) the delivery of charged drugs or 
agents by electromigration, (2) the delivery of uncharged drugs or 
agents by the process of electroosmosis, (3) the delivery of charged 
drugs or agents by the combined processes of electromigration and 
electroosmosis, and/or (4) the delivery of a mixture of charged and 
uncharged drugs or agents by the combined processes of 
electromigration and electroosmosis. Recently, a number of United States patents have issued in the 
iontophoresis field, indicating a renewed interest in this mode of 
drug delivery. For example, Vernon et al US Patent No. 3,991,755; 
Jacobsen et al US Patent No.
