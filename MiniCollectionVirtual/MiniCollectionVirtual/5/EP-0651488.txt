<ABSTRACT>
An electrical protection device 10 includes a 
detecting means 12 for detecting a fault and for 

generating an output signal upon detection of such a 
fault. A latch device 14, responsive to the output 

signal is provided for disconnecting an electrical 
supply from a load upon receipt of the output signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to a protection device. 
More particularly, the invention relates to an 
electrical protection device. According to the invention, there is provided 
an electrical protection device which includes
 
   a detecting means for detecting a fault and for 
generating an output signal upon detection of such a 
fault; and
 
   a latch device, responsive to the output signal, 
for disconnecting an electrical supply from a load upon 
receipt of the output signal. Preferably, the detecting means and the latch 
device are arranged in a common housing. Then, the 
latch device is operable remote from the housing. In 
addition, the latch device may be operable at the 
housing.  The detecting means may comprise a plurality 
of detecting units for detecting various types of 
faults, the latch device being responsive to an output 
signal from any one of the detecting units. Typically, 
in a circuit breaker-type application, the detecting 
means may comprise an over-current detecting unit, a 
short circuit detecting unit and an earth leakage 
detecting unit. The latch device may be a semiconductor device 
or, instead, the latch device may be an electromechanical 
device. It will be appreciated that, by means of the 
latch device, the need for local operation is obviated 
as the device can be operated remotely by means of a 
suitable switching arrangement. Further, the need for 
additional electrical apparatus to facilitate remote 
operation is obviated. The invention is now described by way of 
example with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic 
drawing which shows a schematic block diagram of an 
electrical protection device, in accordance with the 
invention. Referring to the drawing, an electrical 
protection device, in accordance with the invention, is  
 
illustrated and is designated generally by the reference 
numeral 10. The device 10 includes a detecting means 12 
for detecting a fault and for generating an output 
signal when such fault is detected. A latch device, or 
latch, 14 is responsive to said output signal and 
disconnects an electrical supply 16 from a load 18 upon 
receipt of said output signal. The detecting means 12 and the latch 14 are 
arranged in a common housing 20. The device 10 is intended particularly for use 
in circuit breaker-type applications to replace a 
circuit breaker. Thus, the detecting means 12 comprises 
a plurality of detecting units 22, 24 and 26 for 
detecting various types of faults. The detecting unit 22 
is operable to detect an overcurrent fault,
