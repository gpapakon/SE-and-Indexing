Process for the exploitation of brown coal ash, 
in particular electrostatic precipitator ash arising in 

the dry state, to form building materials, characterized 
in that a coarse fraction (II) having a particle size 

lower limit in the range of about 200 to 500 µm is first 
mechanically separated off, the remaining fraction (I) 

having a corresponding particle size upper limit is used 
for the production of brickworks products as such or as 

the very fine fraction (III) thereof with contents having 
a particle size upper limit in the range of about 40 to 

100 µm which is mechanically separated off from a fine 
fraction (IV) containing essentially fine quartz sand, 

while the fine fraction (IV) is used for the production 
of building materials requiring quartz sand, at least the 

majority of the coal particles, coke particles and wood 
particles still contained in the fractions (I, III, IV) 

so used being removed mechanically if necessary. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the coarse fraction, fine fraction and/or very fine 

fraction (I, II, III, IV) are produced by sieving. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the fine fraction and the very fine fraction 

(III, IV) are separated from each other by sifting. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the coal particles, coke particles 

and wood particles are separated off by sifting. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the coarse fraction (II) is separated 

off with a particle size lower limit about 

>
 350 µm, in particular about 
>
 200 to 250 µm. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the very fine fraction (III) is 

separated off with a particle size upper limit about 
<
 40 
to 70 µm. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the brown coal fly ash from a first 

electrostatic precipitator stage is subjected to the 

separation and the very fine fraction (III) separated off  
 

in this case is processed together with the brown coal 
fly ash arising in further electrostatic precipitator 

stages. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the coarse fraction and/or fine 

fraction (II, IV) essentially freed from coal particles, 
coke particles and wood particles is processed together 

with lime and/or cement with pressing of moulded articles 
and autoclaving of the moulded articles to give calcium 

hydrosilicate-bonded moulded articles. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the coarse fraction and/or fine 

fraction (II, IV) essentially freed from coal particles, 
coke particles and wood particles are ground together 

with lime or hydrated lime and/or cement and a prefabricated 
foam or a pore-forming agent with autoclaving to 

give moulded articles of cellular-expanded concrete or 
calcium hydrosilicate-bonded moulded articles having 

pores. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that inherently stable green bricks are produced by 

adding a heat-activatable rapid bonder leading to solidification 
and passing through the raw mixture formed 

through a continuous extrusion unit heating the raw 
mixture and then dividing the column. 
Process according to one of Claims 8 to 10, 
characterized in that the composition to be shaped, 

formed with the coarse fraction and/or fine fraction (II, 
IV) is coloured with a mineral colouring additive, 

preferably in an amount of 1 to 5% by weight. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the fine fraction (IV), essentially 

freed from coal particles, coke particles and wood 
particles, is used as fine sand for mortars, plasters, 

concretes or as casting sand. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the remaining fraction (I) and/or 

the very fine fraction (III), if required after 
mechanical removal of the coal particles, coke particles  

 
and wood particles, after wetting with about 5 to 7% by 

weight of moisture and mixing with additives necessary 
for the production of brickworks products, is shaped by 

pressing to give moulded articles which are fired. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the mixture produced from the 

remaining fraction (I) and/or the very fine fraction 
(III) and from additives necessary for the production of 

brickworks products is made porous with prefabricated 
foam, from which, using a heat-activatable rapid bonder 

leading to solidification, a column is produced in a 
heatable continuous extrusion unit, which column is 

divided into inherently stable green bricks which are 
fired. 
Process according to Claim 13 or 14, characterized 
in that ground waste glass in an amount of up to 

about 10% by weight is added to the mixture produced from 
the remaining fraction (I) and/or the very fine fraction 

(III) and the additives. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the remaining fraction (I) and/or 

the very fine fraction (III), after removing the coal 
constituents, coke constituents and wood constituents, is 

used as an additive with pozzolanic effect in lime- and 
Portland cement-containing matrices.
