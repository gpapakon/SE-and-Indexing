<ABSTRACT>
A method for setting a plurality of operation constants 
in an inverter device to control variably the speed of an 

induction motor, the method which changes a value representing 
the operation constant on a display stepwise in one direction 

of increase and decrease due to an operation of at least one 
constant operation setting key. The method increases the 

stepwise change of the value gradually corresponding to a 
continuously increasing time of another setting key operation, 

and set the value on the display as an aimed value of the 
operation constant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for setting a
plurality of operation constants in an inverter device to variably control
the speed of an induction motor and to a control system for
setting operation constants in an inverter device in
accordance with claims 1 and 6.Document EP-A-0 124 406 shows a method for
setting operation parameters, for example in a video signal, whereby
the switching speed of the parameter being set is dependent on the time
interval during which a control button is depressed. Conventionally, as an operation constant setting method
of this type, there has been known a method in which, when a
plurality of operation constants having different setting
intervals from each other are set by other setting keys than a
ten key respectively provided on an operation panel of an
inverter device, only one kind of speed is used as a changing
speed of a set value to be set by the setting keys.However, in the above-mentioned conventional operation
constants setting method, on a case that a plurality of
operation constants having greatly different setting intervals
from each other, of example 0 to 100 and 0 to 10,000, are to be
set, if the changing speed of the set value is selected to a
constant adjusted in a narrower setting interval, then a
required setting time for a constant adjusted in a wider
setting interval is increased and, if the changing speed of the
set value is selected to the constant adjusted in the wider
setting interval, then it is difficult to fractionally set the
constant adjusted in the narrower setting interval. The present invention aims at eliminating the drawbacks
found in the above-mentioned conventional operation constants
setting method. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention
to provide a method for setting operation constants in an
inverter device, in which a plurality of constants respectively
having different setting intervals from each other can be set
properly and easily.This object is met by the features of claims 1 and 6.In attaining the above object, according to the
invention, there is provided a method for setting operation
constants in an inverter device in which a plurality of
operation constants of an inverter device to variably control
the speed of an induction motor are set by other setting keys
than a ten key. According to the present method, an up key for
increasing a set value, a down key for decreasing the set value
and a fast feed key, respectively provided on an operation
panel of the inverter device, are combined properly to thereby

increasing step, the stepwise changing speed of said

displayed value is increased every predetermined
period at a predetermined rate corresponding to the 

continuous operation of another operation setting
key (2,3,4,5).
A method according to claim 1, wherein in said
increasing step, the stepwise changing speed of said

displayed value is increased by reducing a period
for a stepwise change of said value during the

continous operation of another constant operation
