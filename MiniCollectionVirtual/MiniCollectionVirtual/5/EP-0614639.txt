<ABSTRACT>
Pressure cooking vessel with pot and lid parts (10, 12) which can be screwed one onto the other and are to be connected to one another in the manner of a bayonet closing system, and pot and lid handles (14, 16) which can be latched to one another, with a residual pressure-locking device with a diaphragm (28) which is sealingly inserted into the pot or the lid part (10, 12), the diaphragm movement transmitting pressure from the interior of the pot outwards, and with a latching element (32) which is connectable to and movable by the diaphragm (28) and when the residual internal pressure acts on the diaphragm (28) directly or indirectly connects pot and lid part (10, 12) to one another so as to be fixed in terms of rotation.

<CLAIMS>
A pressure cooker comprising a vessel and a lid 
(10, 12) rotatable one on another and interconnectable 

after the fashion of a bayonet fastening and having 
interlockable vessel and lid hand grips (14, 16) and 

having a residual pressure locking device having a 
movable locking element (32) which in the presence of a 

residual internal pressure in the cooker so 
interconnects the lid and vessel directly or indirectly 

as to prevent relative rotation therebetween, 
characterised in that the residual pressure locking 

device comprises a diaphragm (28) received sealingly in 
the vessel or lid, the movement of the diaphragm 

transmitting pressure from the vessel interior to the 
exterior, the locking element (32) being connectable to 

and movable with the diaphragm. 
A pressure cooker according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the interlocking element is a 

tilting lever (32) which is mounted on or in one of the 
hand grips, one arm (the actuating arm) (38) of the 

lever (32) being connectable to the outside of the 
diaphragm while the other (locking) arm (40) is 

engageable with the respective other hand grip. 
A pressure cooker according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the tilting lever is pivotally 

mounted in a cavity (30) in the lid hand grip (16), the 
cavity (30) being open towards the vessel hand grip 

(14), and the locking arm (40) of the lever (32) 
responds to an actuation of the lever (32) by diaphragm 

movement by extending from the bottom of the lid hand  
 

grip (16) and engaging in a recess (36) on the top of 
the vessel hand grip (14). 
A pressure cooker according to any of the previous 
claims, characterised in that the diaphragm (28) is 

unitary with a hollow elastomeric member (26) 
introduced sealingly into the lid (12). 
A pressure cooker according to claim 4, 
characterised in that the diaphragm (28) serves as a 

flexible wall closing the hollow elastomeric member 
(26). 
A pressure cooker according to claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the hollow elastomeric member 

(26) has a sealing flange (52). 
A pressure cooker according to any of the previous 
claims, characterised in that the interlocking element 

(32) is releasably connected to the diaphragm (28). 
A pressure cooker according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the interlocking element (32) and 

the diaphragm (28) are interconnected after the fashion 
of a press-stud connection, the diaphragm having a 

thickening (54) formed with a trough into which the 
interlocking element (32) can be pressed. 
A pressure cooker according to any of claims 2 to 
8, characterised in that the two arms (38, 40) of the 

lever (32) are bent downwards.  
 
A pressure cooker according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the actuating arm (38) of the 

tilting lever extends into the elastomeric member (26) 
substantially perpendicularly to the lid (12). 
A pressure cooker according to any of claims 2 to 
10, characterised in that the tilting lever (32) is 

tiltable around a fulcrum (34) and is mounted for 
rotation around its actuating end, the same being 

connected to the diaphragm (28). 
A pressure cooker according to claim 11, 
characterised in that the tilting lever (12) has a U-shaped 

upwardly open deformation (42) at the fulcrum 
(34). 
A pressure cooker according to claim 4 or 12, 
characterised in that the actuating arm (38) of the 

tilting lever (32) is guided for vertical reciprocation 
and for rotation in the hollow elastomeric member (26). 
A pressure cooker according to any of claims 2 to 
12, characterised in that the two arms of the tilting 

lever (32) and the thickness of the diaphragm are so 
dimensioned that a positive pressure of â‰¦ 0.04 bar 

inside the vessel deflects the tilting lever 
sufficiently to interlock the vessel and lid. 
A pressure cooker according to any of the previous 
claims, characterised by an adjustable pressure-limiting 

valve.
