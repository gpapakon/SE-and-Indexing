<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF ORGANIC SALTS OF N-PHOSPHONOMETHYLGLYCINEThe present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of organic salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine.Salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine, such as the isopropylamine and trimethyl sulphonium salts are known as active herbicides and are described for example in United States Patent 3,799,758 and United States Patent 4,315,765 respectively.United States Patent No 4,431,594 describes a process for the preparation of organic salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine which comprises reacting N-phosphonomethylglycine with a compound of formula R R R S+ = ZX~1 2 3 (a) wherein R , R and R are the same or different and are alkyl groups having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms or aromatic alkyl groups, X is chloride, bromide or iodide and Z is an electron pair or oxygen, in the presence of a trialkylamine and isolating the product by phase separation between water and a polar functional solvent which is immiscible with water. Preferred compounds of formula (a) inlcude trimethylsulphonium chloride and preferred trialkylamines include Alamine 336 (Alamine is a trade mark of Henkel Co.).Copending British Patent application No. 91033260.7 describes and claims trimethylsulphonium hydrogen sulphate.The applicants have found a preferred process for obtaining organic salts of N-phosphonomethylglycine which requires simpler and less stringent reaction conditions than previous processes and which minimises problems of plant corrosion.According to the present invention there is provided a process for1 2 3 preparing a compound of formula (I) where R , R , and R are independently1 2 3 selected from alkyl or aralkyl or any two of R , R , and R together form a cycloalkyl ring and Y is S or S(0); which process comprises reactingN-phosphonomethylglycine with a compound of formula (II) where m is 0 or 11 2 3 and Y, R , R , and R are as defined in relation to formula (I), in the presence of a base.1 2 3 Preferably when R , R , or R are alkyl or aralkyl, they contain from1-4 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain. Suitable aryl groups for inclusion in1 2 3 aralkyl groups R , R , or R include phenyl.1 2 3 When two of R , E , and R are joined together to form a cycloalkyl ring, the ring suitably contains from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably 6 carbon atoms. 

 1 2 3 Preferably R , R and R are all methyl in which case the compound of formula (I) is trimethylsulphonium N-phosphonomethylglycine.In a preferred embodiment Y is S.It is possible to employ in the process of the
