<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to new hydraulic binders of the quick-setting and quick-hardening type. These binders contain from 50 to 99 % of a natural cement resulting from the calcination at a temperature comprised between 900 and 1 200  C of a raw material containing sulphurated argillaceous phases and calcium carbonate in intimate mixing relationship, from 1 to 50 % of a pouzzolanic product or a filler, from 0 to 5 % of a mineral adduct and from 0 to 5 % of an organic adduct. The invention also relates to the method of preparation of said binders by dry mixing and simultaneous crushing of the various ingredients. The invention also relates to mixtures of said hydraulic binders with artificial cements.

<CLAIMS>
Quick-setting and quick-hardening hydraulic binder, characterised in 
that it contains 50 to 99% of a natural cement resulting from the calcination, at a 

temperature of 900 to 1,200°C, of a sole and same starting material containing 
sulphured argillaceous phases and calcium carbonate in an intimate mixture, and 1 

to 50% of a pozzolanic product. 
Binder according to claim 1, characterised in that the pouzzolanic 
product is derived from the recovery of industrial waste or from the manufacture 

of an artificial pouzzolane. 
Binder according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
pouzzolanic derivative is composed of silica fumes which are constituted of 

amorphous silica grains of dimensions lower than 1 µm (micron). 
Binder according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that it 
contains 0 to 10% of a inorganic mineral additive of the sulphate type. 
Binder according to claim 4, characterised in that the sulphate-type 
additive is an anhydrous or dihydrated calcium sulphate or a sodium calcium 

double sulphate. 
Binder according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that it further 
contains less than 5% of an organic additive intended for improving the hydration 

of said binder during its use. 
Organic binder according to claim 6, characterised in that said organic 
additive belongs to the group consisting of lignosulphonates, gluconates, 

naphthalene, melamine, polyhydroxycarboxylic products, polyvinylsulphone  
 

products, anhydrous or monohydrated citric acid, plasticisers, and 
superplasticisers. 
Hydraulic binder according to one of claims 1 to7, characterised in that 
it contains, in percentages by weight: 


natural cement:
85 - 95% 
pouzzolanic product
3.9 - 11.5% 
inorganic additive:
1 - 10% 
organic additive:
0.1 - 0.5%. 
Method of preparing a binder according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that it consists in dry mixing the natural cement resulting from a 

calcination step carried out between 900 and 1,200°C and the other ingredients, 
and in simultaneously carrying out, in a crusher, the crushing step and the mixing 

step of said constituents. 
Mixture containing 10 to 90% of a binder according to one of claims 1 
to 8, or resulting from the method according to claim 9 with an artificial cement or 

its clinkers of the Portland type. 
Mixture according to claim 10, characterised in that said artificial 
cement is a cement with a high content of pouzzolanic materials, for example a 

pouzzolaic cement or a slag cement. 
Use of the hydraulic binders according to one of claims 1 to 8, or 
resulting from the method according to claim 9, as well as mixtures according to 

one of claims 10 to 11, for the preparation of mortars or concretes.
