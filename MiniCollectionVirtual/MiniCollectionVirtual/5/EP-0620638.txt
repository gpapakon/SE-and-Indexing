<ABSTRACT>
In a differential amplifier having a pair of emitter 
follower outputs, power saving is obtained by switching the 

pull-down currents so that the emitter followers have to provide 
current to drive the load only in the on direction. The preceding 

stage is a cascode stage, so that the switching signals for 
switching the pull-down currents may be derived from the emitter 

circuits of the cascode stage output transistors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuit
amplifiers
, as known e.g. from US-A-4 928 073 or US-A-4 616 189
and in particular although not exclusively the invention
relates to a preamplifier circuit suitable for prescalers fabricated
on high speed bipolar processes. The proposed circuit is also
suitable as a differential clock (or data) buffer for ECL and CML
logic, limiting amplifier, or LO driver for active mixer circuits
etc.The circuit technique was developed to minimise power
consumption in the preamplifier of low voltage prescalers. In this
application, amplification of low level RF input signals is required
to establish clock drive signals suitable for driving the first
divider circuits.According to the present invention in an integrated circuit
amplifier arrangement comprising a differential cascode stage
followed by a pair of emitter followers to inputs of which the
outputs of said differential cascode stage are connected
respectively, there are provided respective transistor switching
means in the emitter circuits of said emitter followers, said
switching means being controlled in dependence upon signals derived
from said differential cascode stage.Amplifier arrangements in accordance with the present
invention will now be described by way of example with reference to
the accompanying drawings, of which Figures 1 and 2 show two
embodiments.The basic circuit principles are described with reference 
to Figure 1. From this it can be seen that the preamplifier
consists of two sections. The input is a differential cascode
stage, incorporating transistors Q1 to Q4, which provides the main
voltage amplification. A low impedance output drive stage is then
provided by means of emitter followers Q7 and Q8 with a switched
pull down current.Power saving is obtained by the switching of the emitter
follower pull down current. This directly results in a saving of
half the current consumption in this section, the magnitude of this
current being chosen to be sufficient to provide the negative output
slew rates required. Due to the switching of the pull down
current, the emitter follower transistors now only have to provide
current to drive the load (on the output terminals) on the positive
going transitions. Previously the emitter followers would have had
to drive the load and overcome the pull down currents. A benefit
resulting from this reduced loading of the emitter followers is to
reduce their drive requirements on the previous cascode stage, hence
reducing its power consumption.Previously other
