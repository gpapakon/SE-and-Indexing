<ABSTRACT>
A concanavalin A-binding protein found in chondrocytes, but not found in 
dedifferentiated cells from chondrocytes. This protein preferably has a molecular 

weight of about 76kD or of about 67 kD after treatment with endoglycosidase 
according to an analysis by SDS-PAGE and at least one of the amino acid 

sequences as shown in SEQ ID No: 1-5. 
Said protein is the substance that relates to differentiation of chondrocytes and 
also to control of functions by chondrocytes and control of cartilaginous 

osteogenesis, and may be utilized as a new type of therapy, prophylaxis and 
diagnosis of cartilaginous metabolic diseases and metabolic bone diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel glycoprotein which may participate in
differentiation of chondrocytes. The new glycoprotein according to this invention
may be also applied as a marker for differentiation of chondrocytes.Animal cartilage tissues are composed of chondrocytes and matrices. Cartilage
tissues constitute a major portion of skeleton during the embryonic stage and, after
birth, they are replaced by bone through cartilaginous osteogenesis. At the onset
of cartilaginous osteogenesis, cartilage tissues would be transformed from
quiescent cartilage tissues to proliferative cartilage tissues and successively
differentiated to hypertrophic cartilage tissues. As discussed above, it has been
well-known that chondrocytes are essential cells particularly for osteogenesis
during the growth period. However, there remain many aspects not yet elucidated
in regard to differentiation of chondrocytes and cartilaginous osteogenesis.On the other hand, Yan et al. [Yan et al.; J. Biol. Chem. vol. 265, pages 10125-10131,
1990)] and Kato et al. [Kato et al., Japanese Journal of Bone Metabolism,
vol. 10, No. 2, pages 187-192 (1992)] have studied the effect of lectin on
differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes, and, inter alia, elucidated that
concanavalin A, which is a jack bean lectin and has an affinity to α-D-mannose
residues and α-D-glucose residues, can strongly increase synthesis of proteoglycan,
which is a marker of differentiation of chondrocytes. There remain, however, many
unclear points of its mechanism, wherein what receptor molecules concanavalin A
may be bound to on the cell membrane of chondrocytes, how its stimulus may be
transferred to such target sites as the nucleus in the cells and so on.Moreover, it has been reported that chondrocytes, when excess retinoic acid
(identical with Vitamin A) is added, may be modified to the so-called
dedifferentiated type of cells, wherein they may be deformed in morphology from 
the spherical cells peculiar to differentiated chondrocytes to the fibroblast-like flat,
expanded cellular form with an increased expansibility and may biochemically lose
a synthesis ability of glicosaminoglycan (GAG), which is a differentiation marker for
chondrocytes and other [Benya et al., Develop. Biol., vol. 118, pages 296-305
(1986)]. However, there has not yet been reported any relationship between the
reactivity of chondrocytes to concanavalin A and the differentiation of
chondrocytes.Hence the problem of the present invention was to elucidate the substance capable
