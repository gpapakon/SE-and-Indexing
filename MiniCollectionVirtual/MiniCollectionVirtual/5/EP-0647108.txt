<ABSTRACT>
Proposed is a drawer construction set comprising two metal sidewalls (1) and a rear wall (2, 3). The sidewalls (1) are fitted with inwards-pointing flanges (4) at the rear ends and have support flanges (11) for a floor plate (8). The metal rear wall (2, 3) has two hooks (18) which can be inserted into slots (15) in the flanges (4). Also located on the rear wall (2, 3) are positioning studs (19) which project into matching openings (16) in the flanges (4) and prevent vertical movement of the rear wall (2, 3) with respect to the sidewalls (1).
