<ABSTRACT>
A roller press, in particular for processing strongly abrasive substances, has at least two pressing rollers provided each with a wearing coat arranged on a base body. The wearing coat has substantially flat areas made of a highly wear-resistant material whereas the spaces between the highly wear-resistant areas are filled with a material having a different wear resistance. In addition, the material that fills the intermediate spaces is a sinterable composite material and the higly wear-resistant areas are formed of hard bodies produced by high-temperature isostatic pressing. The material that fills the intermediate spaces and the material of the wear-resistant areas are secured to the base body by a high-temperature isostatic pressing process. The wear resistance of the composite material is slightly higher of lower than the wear-resistance of the hard bodies, according to the desired profile to be obtained by wearing. Also disclosed is a process for producing said wearing coat.

characterized in
 that said hard bodies (7) are in the form
of small plates.

characterized in
 that the material for said hard bodies and
the material for said spaces have a carbide content of up

to 65%.
The roll press according to any one of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in
 that said wear layer (4) is applied in
planar fashion to the whole surface of a working area (A)

of said press roll (1).
The roll press according to any one of claims 1 to 10,

characterized in
 that said wear layer (4) is arranged
between surrounding webs (9) which laterally define said

working area (A) and extend radially to the outside
relative to said basic roll body (2).
The roll press according to any one of claims 1 to 11,

characterized in
 that a plurality of pocket-like recesses
which are substantially distributed in a uniform manner on

the circumference and in which said wear layer (4) is
respectively received are formed in the outer casing of

said basic roll body (2) in said working area (A) of said
press roll (1).
