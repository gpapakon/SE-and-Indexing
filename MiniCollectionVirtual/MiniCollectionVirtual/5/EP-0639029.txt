<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to the 
conversion of a frame format of a television signal, and more 
particularly to an apparatus for converting the frame format 
of the television signal in which a scanning format and the 
number of scanning lines of a video signal are converted with 
no degradation of a resolution of a high definition television 
receiver. Recently, a high definition television signal has been 
proposed in U.S.A. to accommodate various frame formats with 
no limitation to a single one. The frame formats of the high 
definition television signal may generally be classified into 
progressive scanning formats with 787.5 vertical scanning 
lines and progressive and interlaced scanning formats with 
1050 vertical scanning lines. For this reason, conversion 
must be performed among the various frame formats. Namely, because a display format is limited to a single 
type depending on a characteristic of a monitor at a receiving 
stage, any one of the various frame formats, as mentioned 
above, transmitted from a broadcasting station must be 
converted into the display format of the monitor.  Therefore, the present invention has been made in view of 
the above problem, and it is an object of the present 
invention to provide an apparatus for converting a frame 
format of a television signal transmitted from a broadcasting 
station into a display format of a monitor with no degradation 
of a resolution of a high definition television receiver. In accordance with the present invention, the above and 
other objects can be accomplished by a provision of an 
apparatus for converting a frame format of a television 
signal, comprising scanning format conversion means for 
converting a scanning format of an input video signal into a 
progressive scanning type if it is of an interlaced scanning 
type; scanning line conversion means for converting the number 
of vertical scanning lines of an output video signal from said 
scanning format conversion means into that of a display 
format, said scanning line conversion means including 3:4 line 
conversion means for converting the number of the vertical 
scanning lines of the video signal from said scanning format 
conversion means into 1050 if it is 787.5, 4:3 line conversion 
means for converting the number of the vertical scanning lines 
of the video signal from said scanning format conversion means 
into 787.5 if it is 1050, 2:1 line conversion means for 
converting the number of the vertical scanning lines of the  
 
video signal from said
