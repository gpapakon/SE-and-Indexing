<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a thermostatic fry pan, its sensor being located at 
the bottom of the pan. A concordant sensory coil (20) or heat producing 

body is attached to the bottom of the pan with allowance made for 
attachment of a sensor (30). Maintenance of tight attachment of the 

sensor (30) is insured by a spring piece (40) and reinforced by an 
electric follow-up sensor, hence attaining the best thermo-sensory, 

thermostatic and safety effects.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is about a type of thermostatic fry-pan 
with an in-built thermo-sensory structure, hence its name the 
botton thermo-sensory thermostatic fry-pan. The goal of this invention is in improving on the 
follwoing defects usually found in a thermostatic fry-pan: 
1. When the food is heated up rapidly, those at the 
bottom tends to be overheated and as a result, get burnt. 2. 
When using a fry-pan made for an electro-magnetic stove, the 
thermo-sensory mechanism in the pan is usually too slow to 
keep up with the all too rapid temperature rise in the mega 
powered electro magnetic stove. 3. The thermo-sensory 
mechanism in the usual thermostatic fry pan is still far from 
perfect and may cause the cook unnecessary troubles with 
temperature control, thus, enhancing the element of risk. The purpose of this invention is to provide a "Thermostatic 
fry pan with bottom sensor", allowing the thermal 
sensory to come into direct contact with the bottom of the 
pan, hereby attaining the best effect in thermal sensory plus 
highest effeciency in thermal feed-back control. Another purpose of this invention is in providing a 
"Thermostatic fry pan with bottom sensor" especially adapted 
for use on a high efficiency electro-magnetic fry pan, 
allowing precise thermal control. One other goal of this invention is in achieving precise 
thermal control plus safety precaution through the thermo-sensory 
resistence built up from a electronic feed back 
circuit. This invention comprises mainly of a concordant sensory 
coil or heat producer at the bottom of the pan, with allowance 
made for a sensor. Maintenance of tight attachment of the 
sensor is ensured by a spring piece and reinforced by an 
electric follow-up sensor, hence attaining the best thermo-sensory, 
thermostatic and safety effects. A secondary characteristic of this invention is that its 
thermal sensor is a heat sensitive resistance or some other 
heat sensory mechanism. Pecision in temperature control is 
achieved by a feed back controlled thermo-sensory resistance  
 
operated via a electronic circuit. The electric circuit 
comprises a constant voltage transistor and heat sensitive 
resistance a differential voltage circuit made up of variable 
resistance; hence motivating the continuous power, the 
electric resonance inducer or heat producing electric current 
in that order. Below are examples and illustrations to demonstrate the 
technique and methods involved plus the functions of the 
instrument. This will aid in the comprehension of above

<CLAIMS>
A thermostatic fry pan with bottom sensor that it 
consists of a concordant sensory coil or heat producer at the 

bottom of the pan, with allowance make for a thermal sensor 
and is attached via a spring-piece, and then, on top of that,the 

thermal sensor is also connected to an electric feedback 
circuit, attaining the best thermal sensory effect, precise 

control of temperature and safety measures. 
According to No. (1), precision in temperature 
control is attained via a electric feedback on the resistance 

of the thermal-sensor. 
According to No (1) or (2), the thermal-sensor is 
a heat sensitive resistor or other heat sensor. 
According to No (1), the electric circuit comprises 
a constant voltage transistor and heat sensitive resistor, 

variable resistor making up a differential circuit, hence 
motivating the continuous electricity, electric resonance 

inducer or electric heat producer. 
According to No (1) there is a contact arm on the 
thermal sensor connected to a angle of micro-switch, hence 

current is only switched on at a certain inclination of the 
pan, attaining precision in thermal control and good safety 

measures.
