A distillation system, particularly useful 
for the cryogenic distillation of feed air, employing a 

first column (1) and a partitioned second column (2) whereby 
three separate product streams (12,13,14,15) may be withdrawn from 

the partitioned column.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to 
distillation, and is particularly useful in carrying 
out cryogenic distillation such as the distillation of 
feed air into product nitrogen, oxygen and crude argon. A major cost in separating a feed into 
product by distillation is the capital cost of 
distillation columns. In the conventional cryogenic 
distillation of feed air to produce product nitrogen, 
product oxygen and product crude argon, three columns 
are used: a first column operating at a higher 
pressure wherein a preliminary separation is made, a 
second column operating at a lower pressure wherein 
product nitrogen and oxygen are made, and a third 
column wherein product crude argon is produced. The Handbook "Tieftemperaturtechnik", H. Hausen, H. Linde, Springer Verlag, 1985, pages 
332 and 333, discloses a three column distillation system for the separation of air into product 
nitrogen, oxygen and crude argon comprising a first column operating at a higher pressure 
wherein a preliminary separation is made, a second column operating at a lower pressure 
wherein product nitrogen and oxygen are made, and a third column wherein product argon is 
produced. US-A-4 230 533 discloses a single distillation column for separating a three-component feed 
mixture, which comprises in its central region a vertical partition dividing the central region 
into first and second columns. It is desirable to have a distillation system 
which can produce three products using only two columns 
as this would significantly reduce the capital cost of 
the distillation system. In the case of cryogenic air 
separation, it is desirable to be able to produce crude 
argon directly from the lower pressure column thus 
avoiding the need for a third column. Accordingly, it is an object of this 
invention to provide a distillation column system 
comprising two columns wherein a product may be 
produced from an intermediate point of the second 
column as well as from the upper and lower portions of 
the second column. It is another object of this invention to 
provide a cryogenic rectification method for processing 
feed air wherein crude argon is produced while 
employing only two columns.  
  
 The above objects will become 
apparent to one skilled in the art upon a reading of 
this disclosure are obtained by the present invention 
one aspect of which is: A cryogenic rectification method comprising: 
(A) passing feed air into a first column and separating the feed air by cryogenic 
rectification within the first column into a
