<ABSTRACT>
A volumetric water meter of the type having an eccentric piston oscillating in a cylindrical chamber has a drive peg (64) on the piston engaging a rotor arm (50) which rotates about the chamber axis to drive an external register or the like. The drive peg is offset from the piston axis by that amount necessary to compensate for the periodic variation in angular velocity of the piston. The likelihood of the peg becoming disengaged from the rotor arm is thus considerably reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
FLUID METERS AND PUMPSThis invention relates to fluid devices and in the most important example to volumetric fluid meters.Typically, a volumetric water meter comprises an eccentric piston oscillating within a chamber which has inlet and outlet ports. The piston moves circumferentially about the axis of the chamber and sweeps a known volume as fluid passes from the inlet to the outlet port. A magnetic or other external connecting element is rotationally driven by the piston through a drive coupling which conventionally takes the form of a peg or post on the piston engaging a radial arm of the connecting element.Because of the nature of the fluid forces acting upon the piston, the angular velocity of its circumferential movement is not constant but varies with the angular rotation. Typically, the angular velocity will vary between one maximum and one minimum in each cycle, the maximum and the minimum being diametrically opposed.This angular velocity modulation can create severe operating difficulties. For example, the driven radial arm can become disengaged from the piston drive peg, when the angular velocity of the piston reduces, as a result of the angular momentum of the connecting element, and of the register or other elements to which it is magnetically coupled. The piston drive peg will then re-engage the radial arm when the piston angular velocity increases. This cyclical disengagement and re-engagement can lead to problems of:- (i) wear or damage to the radial arm and the piston drive peg;(ii) significantly increased operating noise; (iii) abnormal wear to components of the register; (iv) loss of the magnetic coupling. If the magnetic coupling is lost, it may possibly not be re-established until the water flow drops substantially to zero. This loss of coupling of course results in an understatement of the water flow, which may be significant. 

 Certain of these problems have been identified previously and reference is directed to U.S. 4,738,136 which proposes a solution. In the arrangement disclosed in this prior art reference, the radial arm is made convex at the point of driving engagement with the piston drive post, the arc of curvature of the contact surface being essentially complementary to the arc of curvature of the drive post. In this way, it is suggested that the hitherto point contact between the piston drive post and the radial arm is replaced by a more extensive area of contact. It is explained that in addition to dissipating the energy of re-engagement over a wider contact area,

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1 . A fluid device comprising a cylindrical chamber with an axis and having a fluid inlet port and a fluid outlet port; a piston eccentrically disposed within the chamber and having a cylindrical piston wall in sealing engagement with an interior surface of the chamber such that circumferential movement of the piston about said axis sweeps a fixed volume of fluid passing from the fluid inlet port to the fluid outlet port, the angular velocity of the piston in said circumferential movement varying with the angle of rotation; a rotatable drive member extending outwardly of the chamber for external drive connection with the piston and coupling means acting between the piston and the drive member, said coupling means comprising respective abutment surfaces of the piston and the drive member; characterised in that the point of contact between said abutment surfaces is offset radially from said axis in a direction to compensate for said variation in angular velocity.
2. A fluid device according to Claim 1 , wherein the abutment surface of piston is so shaped and positioned that on circumferential movement of the piston, point of driving contact between the respective abutment surfaces of the coupling means follows a circular path eccentric to the axis of the chamber.
