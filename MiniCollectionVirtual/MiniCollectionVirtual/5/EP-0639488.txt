<ABSTRACT>
The locking (chocking) device comprises a sled (3) which can move in both direction along a track (2) beneath the location intended for the vehicle perpendicular to a platform (ramp) (1). On the sled (3), a pulling member (4) is attached to an endless chain (26) actuated by a motor (24), and a pair of arms (5, 6) each pivotably mounted (5a, 6a) between a distal end (5c, 6c) where a wedge (7, 8) is fixed, and a proximal end (5b, 6b) connected to the pulling member by a link rod (15, 16), the pair of link rods converging towards the platform. The arms (5, 6) can thus move angularly between a standby position in which they are parallel to the track (2) with the wedges pointing towards the platform (1) and a deployed position in which, bearing against limit stops (33, 34), they form an angle of approximately 90 DEG in order to bring the wedges (7, 8) in line with the wheels of the vehicle. When the chain (36) pulls the sled (3) away from the platform (1), the arms are in the standby position and can slip between the rear wheels of the vehicle. When the chain (36) pulls the sled (3) towards the platform, the arms (5, 6) are separated and the wedges (7, 8) engage under the wheel.

Apparatus for blocking the wheels (12, 12') of a commercial 
vehicle (10) in combination with a dock platform (1) against which 

the vehicle is backed, to prevent it from moving away from said dock 
platform during loading and unloading, and comprising for that 

purpose wheel chocks (7, 8) at the end of pivoting arms (5, 6), 
characterised in that it comprises a traction member (4) drivable by 

a motor (24) in the two directions along a path (2) perpendicular to 
the dock platform (1), above which path the vehicle (10) is 

positioned, a sled (3) movable along the path (2) with a pair of arms 
(5, 6) mounted pivotably (5a, 6a) on the sled (3) symmetrically with 

respect to the path (2), each extending on respective sides of the 
pivot (5a, 6a) from a proximal end (5b, 6b) to a distal end (5c, 6c), 

the latter bearing a wheel chock (7, 8), and the arms being capable 
of a horizontal angular movement about their pivot (5a, 6a) between a 

waiting position in which they are substantially parallel to the 
path with their distal end (5c, 6c) towards the dock platform (1), 

and a blocking position in which, bearing against abutments (33, 34) 
which are fixed with respect to the sled (3), they are moved apart 

forming an angle of less than 180Â° with the chocks in the tracks of 
the wheels (12, 12'), the proximal ends (5b, 5c) being coupled to the 

traction member (4) by respective links (15, 16) which are convergent 
towards the dock platform (1). 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
traction member (4) is mounted slidably on the sled (3) parallel to 

the path, with a travel (30) which is limited at least in 
correspondence (32) with the waiting position of the arms (5, 6). 
Apparatus according to one of claims 1 and 2 characterised 
in that the sled (3) is fitted with locks (35, 36) for blocking the 

arms (5, 6) in the waiting position.  
 
Apparatus according to claim 3 characterised in that the 
sled (3) is provided with a frame (31) with two longitudinal members 

(31c, 31d) slidable parallel to the path (2) and projecting beyond 
the sled (3) to be connected by transverse members (31a, 31b), 

buffers being disposed respectively close to and remote from the dock 
platform (1) at the ends of the path (2) and capable of moving the 

frame (31), at the end of the movement of the sled (3), respectively 
to unlocking and locking positions, the locks (35, 36) being formed 

in projecting relationship on the longitudinal members (31c, 31d) in 
such a way as each to engage against an inside edge of the proximal 

end (5a, 6a) of the arms (5, 6) in the waiting position, the frame 
(31) being moved into the locking position. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the path (2) comprises a tie (26) in loop form 

which at the ends of the path (2) passes around two return wheels 
(24a, 25) of which the wheel (24a) which is close to the dock 

platform is coupled to the motor (24) of the traction member (4), the 
tie having two ends fixed to the traction member (4), in parallel 

alignment with respect to the path (2). 
Apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in that the tie 
(26) is a calibrated chain and the return wheels (24a, 25) are 

pulleys with recesses therein. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 5 and 6 characterised 
in that the return wheels (24a, 25) are disposed parallel to the 

ground, with their axis vertical. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 5 to 7 
characterised in that the tie forming two runs, a return run (26b) 

and a traction run (26a), the latter is disposed on the axis of the 
path (2) close to the ground.
