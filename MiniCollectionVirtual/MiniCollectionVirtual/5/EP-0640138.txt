<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a DNA fragment
containing a gene for alkaline pullulanase derived from
an alkalophilic strain of the genus Bacillus to a
recombinant vector with said DNA fragment inserted
therein, and further to a transformant microorganism
transformed with said vector containing said DNA fragment.The present invention also relates to alkaline
pullulanase for use as an effective additive in
detergents, which is obtained by a recombinant
technique, and to a method of preparing the
pullulanase.Pullulanase is an enzyme which cuts specifically
the alpha-1,6-glucoside bond present in the molecule of
pullulan to generate maltotriose as the major product.
This enzyme was first found by Bender and Wallenfels
[Biochem. Z., 334, 79, (1961)] in culture of Aerobacter
aerogenes. Since then, various microorganisms have
been reported to produce alkaline pullulanases, which
include Bacillus sp. [J. Jpn. Soc. Starch Sci., 30,
200, (1983)], Bacillusacidopullulyticus [Agric. Biol.
Chem., 52, 2293, (1984)], Bacillusstearothermophilus 
[Eur. J. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol, 17, 24, (1983)],
Streptococcusmitis [Biochem. J., 10, 33, (1968)],
Lactobacillus [Starch Science, 28, 72, (1987)],
Clostridiumthermohydrosulfuricum [Appl. Environ.
Microb., 49, 5, (1985); Biochem.J., 246, 193, (1987)],
Thermus sp. [J. Jpn. Soc. Starch Sci., 34, 1, (1987)],
and Clostridiumthermosulfurogenes [Appl. Microb.
Biotechnol., 33, 511 (1990)].Presently, pullulanase is known to hydrolyze the
alpha-1,6-glucoside linkages not only of pullulan, but
also of starch, glycogen, amylopectin, and branched
oligosaccharides, and is called a "debranching enzyme".
This enzyme is also known to produce glucose, maltose
and maltooligosaccharides (such as maltotriose,
maltotetraose, maltopentaose and maltohexaose), from
starch with high yield when used in combination with
endo-type amylase and with exo-type amylase. In recent
years, therefore, pullulanase is highlighted in starch-manufacturing
industry.Based on the characteristics of the pullulanase, the
inventors of the present invention incorporated
pullulanase and alpha-amylase into detergents. They
discovered that the detergent power of the compositions
was markedly enhanced especially against starch soil,
and filed a patent application (Japanese Patent
Application Laid-open (Kokai) No. 132193/1990).Enzymatic components of detergents must exhibit
their maximal activities in an alkaline pH range, or 
must be resistant to alkaline washwater. However,
almost all pullulanases found hitherto in the

An isolated DNA fragment coding for alkaline pullulanase
obtainable from Bacillus Sp. KSM AP1378 having pullulanase

activity but no alpha-amylase activity which comprises about
6.3 Kb base pairs and has a restriction map shown in Fig. 2.
A recombinant vector containing the DNA fragment as
defined in Claim 1.
A microorganism carrying the recombinant vector as
defined in Claim 2.
Alkaline pullulanase obtainable by culturing a
transformed microorganism which has been transformed

with a recombinant vector containing a DNA fragment
as defined in claim 1, and

having the following enzymological properties:

1) Action:

   Hydrolyze pullulan and amylopectin at the alpha-1,6-glucoside
bond thereof to produce maltotriose, and

also hydrolyze partial decomposition products thereof
at the alpha-1,6-glucoside bond thereof;
2) Substrate Specificity:

   Among saccharides which have a branching structure at
the alpha-1,6-glucoside bond, hydrolyze such branching

structures of maltotriose or of oligosaccharides with a
higher polymerisation degree (pullulanase activity)

but no alpha-amylase activity (1,4-glucoside bond);
3) Working pH and Optimum pH:

   Works in the pH range between 6.5 and 10.5, with
the optimum pH range at 8.5 to 9.5;
4) pH Stability:

   Very stable in the pH range between 6.0 and 10.0,
and retained more than 30% of the original act
icity at 
a pH values between pH 5.5 - 10.5, upon heating at 50°C

for 10 minutes;
5) Working temperature and optimum working
temperature:

   Works in a temperature range of 35 to 60°C, with the
optimum working temperature being at about 50°C;
6) Temperature stability:

   Very stable up to 50°C under treatment at pH 9 for
30 minutes in 10 mM glycine-NaCl-NaOH buffer,
7) Molecular weight:

   115,000 ± 5,000, as judged by sodium dodecyl
sulfate electrophoresis;
8) Effects of metal ions:

   Activity is inhibited in the presence of Hg
2+
 and
Cd
2+
 ions;
9) Effects of surfactants

   Activity is hardly affected by a sodium salt of alkyl
sulfate, a sodium salt of polyoxyethylene alkyl sulfate,

sodium alpha-olefinsulfonate, sodium alpha-sulfonated
aliphatic ester, sodium alkylsulfonate, sodium dodecyl

sulfate, soap or softanol;
10) Effects of chelating agents:

   Activity is hardly affected by EDTA, EGTA, citric acid
or zeolite.
A method of preparing alkaline pullulanase which
comprises culturing a transformed microorganism which has

been transformed with a recombinant vector containing a
