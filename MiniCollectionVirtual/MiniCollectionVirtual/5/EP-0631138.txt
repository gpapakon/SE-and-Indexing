<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed a process for detecting and 
determining an oxidized lipid, which is capable of readily 

and accurately determining a specimen to contain an oxidized 
lipid, and a process for forming a water-soluble oxidized 

lipid having a hydroperoxide group which has specific 
influence on a living body. A specimen is detected and 

determined to contain an oxidized lipid by adding a 
lanthanide shift reagent to a specimen, followed by 

spectroscopic analysis thereof. An oxidized lipid is formed 
by adding superoxide dismutase (SOD) and CuSO₄ to a linoleic 

acid emulsion prepared by dissolving linoleic acid in 
deuterated methyl alcohol and adding the solution to a 

deuterated phosphate buffer under stirring, or to a low 
density lipoprotein solution sufficiently dialyzed against 

an undeuterated phosphate buffer; followed by irradiation 
with long-wave ultraviolet light.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
detecting and determining a water-soluble oxidized lipid,
which is capable of readily confirming a specimen to contain
a water-soluble oxidized lipid.Oxidized lipids are believed to cause adverse
effects in vivo, and are pointed out to be responsible for
arteriosclerosis, cancer, inflammation and the like. It is
also believed that low density lipoproteins which account
for a majority of lipids in blood are greatly related to the
above-mentioned disorders.On the other hand, oxidized lipids which are
controlled and produced by enzymes in vivo, such as
prostaglandin and leukotriene are likely to become
substances having a strong influence on a living body.
Various methods for detecting a stable oxidized lipid or a
final metabolite have been developed. These methods
include, for example, iodine oxidation method which
comprises ionizing iodine by oxidation, followed by emission
spectroscopic analysis on the ionized iodine; TBARS
(thiobarbituric acid reactive substance) measuring method
which comprises producing a pigment by reaction with
malondialdehyde as a peroxide lipid metabolite, followed by 
determination of the pigment by means of an absorption
spectrophotometer or a fluorophtometer; conjugated diene
determination method which comprises determining a
conjugated diene based on the fact that a conjugated diene
is formed by peroxidation of an unsaturated fatty acid; high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method which
comprises separating and determining a peroxide lipid sample
by means of a high performance liquid chromatograph; gas
chromatography method which comprises esterifying a peroxide
lipid sample, followed by separation and determination by
means of a gas chromatography.On the other hand, various methods for producing
an oxidized lipid have heretofore been reported. As these
methods, there may be mentioned, for example, a method which
comprises adding a transition metal such as copper cation
(Cu+) or iron cation (Fe2+) to a lipid sample, and allowing
the mixture to stand at a temperature of about 37°C for a
period of 20 to 30 hours; a method which comprises
irradiating a sample that is preliminarily added with a
photosensitive substance with light; a method which
comprises oxidation by an enzyme such as lipoxygenase or
cyclooxygenase.However, the iodine oxidation method and the
conjugated diene determination method which determine an
oxidized lipid have a drawback in that they are not suitable
for analysis of a sample containing an impurity.
