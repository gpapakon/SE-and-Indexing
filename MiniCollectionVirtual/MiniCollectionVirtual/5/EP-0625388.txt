<ABSTRACT>
Method for the controlled pre-rolling of thin slabs (20) 
leaving a continuous casting plant, whereby the pre-rolling 

is carried out with a plurality of pairs of rolls (14-16) 
grouped together in one or more pre-rolling assemblies (10), 

the first of the pre-rolling assemblies (10) being 
positioned immediately downstream of foot rolls (12) of a 

mold (11), at least one displaceable roll (16) being 
included in the pairs of rolls (14-16), the pairs of rolls 

(14-16) being associated with pressure transducer means (18) 
and hydraulic capsule means (17), position transducer means 

(24) being included, the pressure transducer means (18) and 
position transducer means (24) can be associated with a data 

processing unit (21), at least the first of the pairs of 
rolls (14-16) processing a slab (20) which has just emerged 

from the mold (11) with a thin solidified skin. The method 
achieves a pre-rolling with a reduction of the thickness of 

the slab (20) leaving the last pair of pre-rolling rolls 
(14-16) by at least 10% so as to eliminate the liquid core 

and to bring into contact the zones in a two-phase condition 
in order that the central solidification structure be 

refined and the central separation be minimized.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a method and a device for the controlled pre-rolling
of thin slabs leaving a continuous casting plant,
and the relative device.To be more exact, this invention concerns a method and
relative device for controlled pre-rolling, carried out on
thin slabs leaving a mold for the continuous casting of thin
slabs, immediately downstream of the foot rolls of that mold
and concerns also the device suitable to apply that method.By thin slabs are meant slabs 800 to 2500 mm. wide, or
more, and 25 to 90 mm. thick.The invention is applied advantageously, but not only, to
slabs having a final thickness between 30 and 60 mm. at the
outlet of the continuous casting machine.The invention can also be applied to the continuous
casting of billets, whether the billets be round, square,
rectangular, etc.The invention can be applied to straight and curved
continuous casting plants.Pre-rolling methods are known whereby a thin slab
undergoes a pre-rolling action in a zone distant from the
foot rolls.In the methods of the state of the art disclosed in JP-A-130759,
US-A-3,891,025, US-A-4,056,140 and US-A-4,134,440
the pre-rolling does not give satisfactory results inasmuch
as it is performed in a position of the slab such that the
liquid core or pool is only seldom still present and the
skin of the slab is anyway already thick and is such that it
cannot be readily deformed.Moreover, the skin of one side of the slab is connected to
the skin of the other side by columnar solidification 
elements at an intermediate position between the edges; both
the edges, which contain a consistent solidified thickness,
and also the columnar solidification elements offer a strong
resistance to any alteration of the thickness of the slab.The pre-rolling in the methods of the state of the art,
therefore, has only a marginal and very limited effect,
which does not give the envisaged results.Moreover, the pre-rolling as carried out in the methods of
the state of the art has only the purpose of performing a
marginal superficial work, and the real work of reducing the
thickness of the slab is entrusted to the rolling train
located downstream.Furthermore, in the pre-rolling assemblies of the state of
the art only some pairs of rolls are controlled to check the
pre-rolling parameters, and these pairs of rolls are
controlled in a differentiated or separate manner (see JP-A-130759).
This has the result that the operating method
cannot be conditioned according to specific requirements but
is quite random in some ways.Pre-rolling
