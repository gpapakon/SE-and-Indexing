<ABSTRACT>
An open truss structure includes a plurality of ceramic truss members integrally cast in the form of a three-dimensional, lightweight, monolithic truss. The truss structure may be an integral part of a ceramic mirror substrate that supports a precision mirror surface. A dissolvable core used to form the truss with a slip casting method can be made by forming a plurality of internal passages in a suitably-shaped piece of a nonporous material. The nonporous material becomes the dissolvable core and the internal passages form the integral truss members when filled with a liquid-containing ceramic slip. The nonporous material used to make the dissolvable core is capable of dissolving at a temperature below the freezing point of the liquid in the ceramic slip.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionMonolithic Ceramic Truss StructureTechnical FieldThe present invention is directed to monolithic ceramic truss structures, particularly monolithic ceramic truss structures useful as mirror substrates.Background ArtThe development of space-based imaging technologies has created a need for dimensionally stable, stiff, low mass, high natural frequency, precision mirrors. Such mirrors are also useful for ground-based research, such as laser research, and in commercial imaging technologies where dimensional stability and low weight are important considerations. Mirrors used for these applications should have highly efficient substrates, that is, substrates with low areal densities and high structural stiffness. Areal density is the mirror's weight per unit area of reflective surface.Traditionally, most precision mirrors have been made from glass or glass-ceramics because these materials are easy to shape and polish into optical surfaces. Moreover, glass and glass-ceramics can have low coefficients of thermal expansion, which give them the thermal stability needed for optical applications. These materials, however, have poor structural properties. As a result, mirrors made from these materials must often have a large mass to provide adequate structural support to the mirror's reflective surface. This is evident from the typical areal density of a glass mirror, which can range from about 20 kg/m2 to several hundred kg/m2. 

 Mirrors with a large mass can create many problems, both on the ground and in space. On the ground, the weight of these mirrors poses significant handling problems. Moreover, the force of gravity acting on the mirrors can distort or deform their surfaces, making them dimensionally unstable. In space, where weight is not important, a large mass creates inertia that makes accurate and rapid positioning difficult.Mirrors with a lightweight metal substrate, such as beryllium (Be) , are one alternative to glass mirrors. Such a substrate can support an attached reflective surface or can itself be polished to form a reflective surface. Unlike glass, Be has structural properties suitable for low mass, precision mirrors, such as a high modulus and specific stiffness. For example, Be mirrors made with current manufacturing methods can have areal densities as low as about 15 kg/m2.Silicon carbide (SiC) substrates are another alternative to glass mirrors. Like Be, SiC has a high modulus and specific stiffness and other properties suitable for low mass, precision mirrors. The combination of
