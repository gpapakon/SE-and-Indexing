<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for cleaning in particular PCB-contaminated electric appliances (10) such as transformers filled with a fluid. The device has a fluid circuit (14), a distillator (34) for cleaning the fluid, a mixer (22), in which a headstream coming from the distillator is mixed with the fluid circulating in the circuit and flowing back to the electric device, and a feed pump (26). In order to achieve a reliable decontamination or reclassification with a device having a compact design, the fluid to be cleaned is supplied to the distillator (34) at or almost at the bottom of an evaporator (68), flows in the evaporator through an outer annular space and an inner space separated therefrom, and is heated and at least partially evaporated in the annular space.
