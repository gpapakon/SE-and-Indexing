<ABSTRACT>
A door or window frame hinge comprises two hinge parts (10, 12) each having a bush (14, 18) and a flap (16, 20). A first bush (14) has a cylindrical cavity (24) with a sleeve (28) in which is fitted a pin (22). A second bush (18) has a transversely elongated cavity (26) parallel to a plane of the door or window frame, and a lateral hole (56) for communication with the exterior of the cavity (26). The pin (22) engages the cavity (26) of the second bush (18) with clearance. A threaded diametral hole (54) of the pin (22) is engaged by at least one threaded grub screw (48; 49, 51) transversely whereby to adjust its position with respect to the second bush (18), the opposite ends (48a, 48b, 49a, 51a) of the grub screw abut against opposite faces (50) of the cavity (26) in correspondence with the lateral hole (56). The adjustment means (48; 49, 50) have at least one formation (58; 59, 61) engageable by means of a manipulation tool (T) inserted from the outside through the lateral hole (56) of the second bush part (18).

<DESCRIPTION>
 A hinge for wincr-openable frames, particularly for doors, windows or the likeThe present invention relates to a hinge for wing-openable frames, particularly for doors, windows or the like, comprising: at least two superimposed hinge parts, each having a bush part and a fixing flap for fixing it, respectively, to the fixed frame and to a movable leaf of the door or window frame, in which a first bush part has a generally cylindrical cavity and a second bush part has a cavity the cross-section of which is elongated in a transverse diametral direction which, in the installed condition, is parallel to a general plane of the door or window frame, and in which the wall of the cavity of the second bush part has a lateral hole aligned with the said diametral direction and by means of which the cavity communicates with the exterior of the second bush part, a sleeve inserted in the cavity of the first bush part, a pin extending through the sleeve and into the second bush part, and screw adjustment means which extend transversely in the cavity of the second bush part and engage a threaded diametral hole of the pin to allow adjustment of the position of the pin in the said second diametral direction.A hinge of this general type is known from EP-A-0 271 053.In this known hinge, in the cavity of the second bush part there is located a prismatic insert in the form of a guide slidable in a direction transverse the cavity and which has a cylindrical hole traversed precisely by the pin. 

In the known hinge the transverse screw adjustment means are constituted by a single screw with a head which, in one embodiment, is engaged in a diametral threaded hole of the pin.The prismatic insert is provided with at least one terminal flange interposed between the bush parts of two superimposed hinge parts to guarantee that the axis of the pin and the associated hole of the insert remain always parallel to the axis of the second bush part and the pin is displaced parallel to itself when its position is adjusted by means of the transverse screw.In other words, the flange of the insert has the function of preventing the pin from rocking with respect to the second bush part .The adjustment of the position of the pin to the right or the left in a plane parallel to the general plane of a door or window frame is very useful for allowing the movable leaf of the door or window frame to be positioned squarely with respect to the fixed frame.For example, supposing that the leaf of a door is suspended by means of two or more hinges, the
