<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a distribution chamber of an electric steam iron. According to the invention, the distribution chamber (12) includes two compartments partly separated by a partition (24) whose upper edge (20) is in sealed contact with the cover (13), namely a first compartment (26) connected to the inlet orifice (14) of the reservoir (15) and through which the tap (10) or water-injection device (11) passes, and a second compartment (28) communicating with the first compartment (26) by at least one gulley (30) and capable of constituting a water reserve when the iron is used with its sole in a vertical plane, and into which the orifice (27) of the second water-injection device (21) dips through the cover (13).

Electric steam iron comprising a casing (1) and a sole 
plate (2) extending longitudinally from a tip (3) to a heel 

(4) and separated from the casing (1) by a heat screen (2), 
the sole plate (2) comprising a heating element (7) moulded 

into a protrusion (8) and two vaporisation chambers closed off 
by a cap (5) and separated by a partition (50), that is to say 

a first main vaporisation chamber (9) which is fed with water 
in a first opening (17) in the cap (5) by means of a valve 

(10) of a first water injection device (11) which can be 
actuated by the user, the said valve (10) being mounted in a 

distribution chamber (12) closed off by a cover (13) and 
having an inlet orifice (14) connected to a main water 

reservoir (15), and which is in communication with steam 
outlet orifices (19) formed in the sole plate (2), and a 

second vaporisation chamber (20) which is fed with water by 
means of a second water injection device (21) which can be 

actuated by a user having, on the one hand, an orifice (27) 
connected to the main water reservoir (15) and, on the other 

hand, a water conveyance tube (22) issuing from the second 
water injection device (21) and opening out in the second 

vaporisation chamber (20) through a second opening (23) formed 
in the cap (5), characterised in that the distribution chamber 

(12) has two compartments partly separated by a partition 
(24), the top edge (24') of which is in sealed contact with 

the cover (13), that is to say a first compartment (26) 
connected to the inlet orifice (14) of the reservoir (15) and 

through which passes the valve (10) of the water injection 
device (11), and a second compartment (28) communicating with 

the first compartment (26) through at least one constriction 
(30) and suitable for constituting a water reserve when the 

iron is used with its sole plate in a vertical plane, and in 
which is immersed, through the cover (13), the orifice (27) of 

the second water injection device (21).  
 
Electric steam iron according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the second compartment has the overall shape of a pocket 

whose base (27') is oriented towards the heel (4). 
Electric steam iron according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the distribution chamber (12) also has a 

vent (31) opening out in the first compartment (26) of the 
said distribution chamber (12). 
Electric steam iron according to Claim 3, characterised in 
that the vent (31) is formed in the cover (13) of the 

distribution chamber (12) and is connected by a duct (32) to 
the outside of the casing (1) of the iron. 
Electric steam iron according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the side wall (25) has the 

overall shape of a hook, the free end of which forms, with the 
adjacent wall (38) of the chamber (12), the constriction (30), 

and the foot (39) of which is connected to the wall (38) of 
the distribution chamber (12). 
Electric steam iron according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the two water injection devices are situated on each side 

of the partition (24). 
Electric steam iron according to Claim 5, characterised in 
that the wall (38) of the distribution chamber (12) has an 

ovoidal shape. 
Electric steam iron according to any one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the distribution chamber (12) is 

formed in one piece with the heat screen (6).
