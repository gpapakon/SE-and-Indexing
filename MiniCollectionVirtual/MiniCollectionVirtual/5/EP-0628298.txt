<ABSTRACT>
An ophthalmological surgery system and method for 
performing ablative photodecomposition of the corneal surface 

by offset image scanning. The image of a variable aperture, 
such as a variable width slit and variable diameter iris 

diaphragm, is scanned in a preselected pattern to perform 
ablative sculpting of predetermined portions of a corneal 

surface. The scanning is performed with a movable image 
offset displacement mechanism capable of effecting radial 

displacement and angular rotation of the profiled beam exiting 
from the variable aperture. The profiled beam is rotated by 

rotating the aperture in conjunction with the offset 
displacement mechanism. The invention enables wide area 

treatment with a laser having a narrower beam, and can be used 
in the treatment of many different conditions, such as 

hyperopia, hyperopic astigmatism, irregular refractive 
aberrations, post ablation smoothing and phototherapeutic 

keratectomy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to ophthalmological surgery
techniques which employ a laser to effect ablative
photodecompostion of the anterior surface of the cornea in
order to correct vision defects.Ultraviolet laser based systems and methods are
known for enabling ophthalmological surgery on the surface or
the cornea in order to correct vision defects by the technique
known as ablative photodecomposition. In such systems and
methods, the irradiated flux density and exposure time of the
cornea to the ultraviolet laser radiation are so controlled as
to provide a surface sculpting of the cornea to achieve a
desired ultimate surface change in the cornea, all in order to
correct an optical defect. Such systems and methods are
disclosed in the following U.S. patents and patent
applications:
U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,913 issued May 19, 1987 for
"METHOD FOR OPHTHALMOLOGICAL SURGERY"; U.S. Pat. No. 4,669,466
issued June 2, 1987 for "METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ANALYSIS AND
CORRECTION OF ABNORMAL REFRACTIVE ERRORS OF THE EYE"; U.S.
Pat. No. 4,732,148 issued March 22, 1988 for "METHOD FOR
PERFORMING OPHTHALMIC LASER SURGERY"; U.S. Pat. No. 4,770,172
issued September 13, 1988 for "METHOD OF LASER-SCULPTURE OF
THE OPTICALLY USED PORTION OF THE CORNEA"; U.S. Pat. No.
4,773,414 issued September 27, 1988 for "METHOD OF LASER-SCULPTURE
OF THE OPTICALLY USED PORTION OF THE CORNEA"; U.S.
Patent No. 5,108,388 issued April 28, 1992
for "LASER SURGERY METHOD AND APPARATUS"; U.S. Patent No.
5,163,934 issued November 17, 1992 for "PHOTOREFRACTIVE
KERATECTOMY"; and U.S. Patent No. 4,840,175 issued June 20, 1989 for
"METHOD FOR MODIFYING CORNEAL CURVATURE".In the above-cited U.S. Pat. No. 4,665,913 several
different techniques are described which are designed to
effect corrections for specific types of optical errors in the 
eye. For example, a myopic condition is corrected by laser
sculpting the anterior corneal surface to reduce the
curvature. In addition, an astigmatic condition, which is
typically characterized by a cylindrical component of
curvature departing from the otherwise generally spherical
curvature of the surface of the cornea, is corrected by
effecting cylindrical ablation about the axis of cylindrical
curvature of the eye. Further, a hyperopic condition is
corrected by laser sculpting the corneal surface to increase
the curvature.In a typical laser surgical procedure, the region of
the anterior corneal surface to be ablated in order to effect
the optical correction is designated the optical zone.
