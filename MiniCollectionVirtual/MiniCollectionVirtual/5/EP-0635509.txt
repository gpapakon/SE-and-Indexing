<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel cephalosporin 
compound represented by the following general formula (I) : 
, its pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic salt, physiologically 
hydrolyzable ester, hydrate and solvate, and isomer thereof,in 
which 
R¹represents hydrogen or an amino-protecting group, R² and R³can be identical or different and each represent 
hydrogen or a hydroxy-protecting group, or R² and R³together can form a diol-protecting cyclic group, R⁴represents hydrogen or a carboxyl-protecting group, R⁵represents hydrogen, C₁₋₄ alkyl, alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl or 
sulfomethyl, R⁶represents hydrogen, amino or substituted amino, and  R⁷represents C₁₋₄ alkyl, amino or substituted amino, or R⁵ and R⁶together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached 
may form a 3 to 7-membered cyclic group, or R⁶ and R⁷together with the carbon and nitrogen atoms to which 
they are attached can form a 3 to 7-membered heterocyclic 
ring which may optionally contain additional heteroatoms 
such as nitrogen and/or oxygen and which may be substituted 
with the substituent selected from C₁₋₄ alkyl, amino and 
substituted amino, and Qrepresents CH or N. The present invention also relates to a process for preparation 
of the compound of formula (I), as defined above, and to a 
pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of formula (I) 
as an active ingredient. Cephalosporin antibiotics have been widely used for treating 
diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria in human and animals and 
are paticularly useful for treating diseases caused by bacteria 
which are resistant to other antibiotics such as penicillin 
compounds and for treating penicillin-hypersensitive patients. 
In most cases, it is preferable to use antibiotics which are 
active against both of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. 
However, it has been well known that an antimicrobial 
activity of such cephalosporin antibiotics is greately influenced 
by the substituent on 3- or 7-position of the cephem nucleus.  
 
Accordingly, it has been attempted to develope an antibiotic 
compound which shows a high antibacterial activity against a 
broad range of gram-positive and gram-negative strains and is 
very stable to β-lactamse produced by various gram-negative 
strains and is also very stable in the living tissues. As a 
result thereof, heretofore, numerous cephalosporin antibiotics 
wherein various substituents are introduced into the 7-β 
acylamino moiety and the 3-position of cephem nucleus have been 
developed. For example,
