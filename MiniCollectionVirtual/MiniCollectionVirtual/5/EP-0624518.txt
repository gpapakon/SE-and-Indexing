<ABSTRACT>
A continuous sanitisation method particularly for 
the sanitisation of packs containing sterile containers 

for sterile injectable material so as to prevent cross-contamination 
by the packs of the containers during 

handling of the packs to remove the containers 
therefrom requires sanitisation medium to be admitted 

to and then removed from a sanitisation chamber (31) 
comprised by a sanitisation tunnel for the overall 

handling of the packs in which chamber (31) a relationship 
between concentration of sanitisation medium in the 

sanitisation chamber (31) and time which posses a square 
wave form is maintained. Between each cycle of 

sanitisation operations within a sanitisation chamber (31), 
rinsing with air takes place, which air, when 

withdrawn, is subject to catalytic decomposition of 
vapour phase sanitisation medium entrained therein.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to continuous sanitisation 
system and more particularly to the sanitisation of 
packs themselves containing sterile containers for 
sterile injectable material so as to prevent cross-contamination 
by the packs of the containers during 
handling of the packs to remove the containers 
therefrom. In the medical products industry, pre-packed 
barrels containing vaccine are produced which are to be 
utilised in syringes for injection of the vaccine. 
Prior to filling, the barrels are frequently 
transported in packs holding, say, 100 such barrels 
arranged in an array 10 x 10 such that the barrels do 
not come into contact during transport. The packs for 
transporting the barrels from the barrel manufacturers 
typically consist of a plastics container faced with a 
Tyvek (Registered Trade Mark) panel which can easily be 
pulled off to provide access to the barrels for their 
removal from the pack prior to filling. "Tyvek" is a 
suitable material for a removable cover, insofar as 
preliminary ethylene oxide sterilisation of the entire 
pack of barrels is concerned. Large numbers of such 
packs may need to be produced in a sterile condition 
for despatch for filling by vaccine producers within a 
short time. Influenza vaccines are cultured over a 
short period of time once the required mixture of 
strains has been identified and the product then has to 
be on the market by a particular target date in the 
autumn. This has led to a need for a rapid, reliable 
and environmentally safe means of effecting 
sanitisation of the packs. In this connection, 
sanitisation means reduction in micro concentration to 
no more than 103 microbes/m3. In many circumstances, 
however, a higher degree of microbe kill is desirable  
 
or even required, this being termed sterilisation and 
corresponds to a reduction in microbe concentration to 
below 106 microbes/m3. Sanitisation technology, and sterilization 
technology in which higher standards are set, has 
developed, at least insofar as continuous throughput of 
containers is required primarily in the food processing 
and packaging industry. Examples of developments in 
this field appear in GB-A-669,312. 
The use of isolating chambers in sterilization 
processes is known, inter alia, from US-A-4 707 334 
wherein it is proposed that a barrier be established 
about a conveyor which transports articles to be 
sterilized so that the articles may be conveyed from 
the ambient atmosphere into a chamber where the 
articles are subject to action of a toxic

<CLAIMS>
A continuous sanitisation method which 
comprises supplying a plurality of elements to be 

sanitised, in turn, in batchwise manner to a 
sanitisation tunnel constituted by a series of in-line 

interconnected chambers (2-7) and comprising a sanitisation 
chamber (3) which is flanked by a first air lock chamber (2) with inlet and outlet doors (21, 22) to 

which said elements are initially introduced and by a 
second air lock chamber (4) with inlet and outlet doors (41, 42) so that each element spends a 

predetermined residence time in each of the first air 
lock chamber, the sanitisation chamber and the second air lock 

chamber; 

supplying vapour phase sanitisation medium to the 
sanitisation chamber while at least one said element is 

resident therein, with supply of said sanitisation 
medium to the sanitisation chamber being followed by 

bleeding thereof from the sanitisation chamber and 
being associated with leakage thereof into the first 

and second air locks as communication therebetween and 
the sanitisation chamber is effected, the supply, 

bleeding and leakage of sanitisation medium being 
controlled to be such as to maintain a relationship 

between concentration of sanitisation medium in the 
sanitisation chamber and time which possesses a square 

waveform; 
rinsing with air the interiors of each of the air 
lock chambers after communication thereof with the 

sanitisation chamber; and 
withdrawing said air from the air lock chambers 
and subjecting the air to the action of catalytic 

decomposition means to effect catalytic decomposition 
of vapour phase sanitisation medium entrained therein. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
sanitisation is carried out utilising vapour phase 

hydrogen peroxide. 
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the  
 

temperature within the sanitisation tunnel is 
maintain
ed at from 20 to 60°C, preferably from 35 to 
45°C. 
A method as claimed in claims 2 or 3, wherein 
a relative humidity is maintained within the tunnel 

which is in the range from 10 to 65%, the sanitisation 
medium containing 30% concentration of hydrogen 

peroxide. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 
4, wherein air from the air lock chambers is passed 

over palladium to effect decomposition of hydrogen 
peroxide therein. 
A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 
5, wherein a plurality of notional sanitisation medium 

concentration fronts is provided at each of the entry 
side and the exit side of the sanitisation chamber with 

alternation of phase taking place in respect of each 
front at predetermined intervals. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim 
wherein, while still within the sanitisation tunnel, 

the elements are worked upon in at least one work 
station chamber itself followed by a further said air 

lock chamber. 
A method as claimed in claim 7, wherein said 
elements are empty containers and filling means 

therefor is operated in a said work station chamber. 
A method as claimed in claim 7 or 8, wherein 
manual working of the elements takes place at a said 

work station chamber by means of a glove arrangement 
accessible from outside the work station chamber. 
A method as claimed in claim 8 or 9, wherein 
the alignment of the elements takes place manually in 

an accumulator section preceding the work station 
chamber by means of a glove arrangement accessible from 

outside the accumulator section.
