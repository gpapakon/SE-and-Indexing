<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (101) and technique interactively analyze system 
log-files. System log-files, which are monitored by technical personnel and systems 

specialists to determine system performance, status, and software faults, are often 
generated during various hardware and software monitoring operations. Each log-file 

(120) contains time stamped reports. This technique is especially useful for 
analyzing large log-files. A new release of software may contain many incremental 

versions that must be tested. The testing of each incremental version may generate a 
log-file containing thousands of reports. Using this apparatus (101) and technique, 

reports are correlated, faults are isolated, and temporal patterns are recognized more 
quickly and efficiently than by using conventional, non-graphical techniques.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus having means for storing a plurality of
time-stamped messages, each message having a set of characteristics, and means for
visually displaying a plurality of symbols, with each set of characteristics having at least
three different characteristics, each characteristic of each set of characteristics being
differentiated from other characteristics of the set by variations in form and color of its
respective symbol.Many systems generate log-files as part of their normal operation. Such
files typically contain reports on system performance, system status, and software faults.
These reports are often free-format text. Each report is individually time-stamped
indicating when it was created. By examining a log file, system operators may detect
and correct system and software problems before such problems can affect system
operation.A common trait of log-files is that many unimportant reports are created
along with the important reports. These "noise" reports clutter-up the log-file and
obscure the important reports. For example, a log-file created during a 15 hour test of a
new release of a software program including many incremental versions may contain
55,000 reports comprising 100,000 lines of text which is equivalent to 1600 pages. But
only hundreds of those reports may actually be significant. The "noise" reports in the
log-file may obscure one or more of the important reports and cause it to be overlook by
the operator.In their article entitled, "Visualizing Performance Debugging", appearing
in the October, 1989, issue of COMPUTER, an IEEE publication, Ted Lehr et al.
describe and show displays produced by the operation of their Parallel Programming
and Instrumentation Environment (PIE) visual debugger. PIE is used primarily on
multiprocessor computers to monitor and display the degree of parallel operation of the
multiprocessor. PIE can display activity or non-activity of each processor during a
common interval of time by using one color for activity and another color for non-activity.
The display is a bar chart, with different colored rectangles representing
activity and non-activity. The activity rectangle even has the appearance of being in
front of the non-activity color by perspective shaping and placement. Additionally for 
multiprocessing programs operating on a multiprocessor computer, each process can be
represented by a separately colored activity rectangle. So not only activity is displayed,
but also which activity in regard to what process at what time is

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (101) having means for storing a plurality of time-stamped
messages (120), each message having a set of characteristics, means for

visually displaying a plurality of symbols (103), with each set of characteristics having
at least three different characteristics, each characteristic of each set of characteristics

being differentiated from other characteristics of the set by variations in form and color
of its respective symbol, each symbol (803) corresponding to a respective message

(shown highlighted in 850) of said plurality of messages (120), each symbol (803)
having a position that is determined by a time characteristic which is proportional to the

time-stamp of its respective message (time 22:56:32 shown in 850) and a source
characteristic of the source of the cause of each respective message (ISANBUS shown

in FIG. 8), and a color that is determined by a message type characteristic with each
type of message having a different symbol color, characterized in that:


each symbol is a line-segment (803) varying in inclination according to

at least one more characteristic of its respective message, and
said apparatus has means for displaying the message corresponding to
any symbol (850).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein: each symbol (803) also
varies in texture.
Apparatus according to claim 1, comprising means for displaying
a selector window (705) that allows selected values of an attribute to not be displayed.
Apparatus according to claim 1,2 or 3, comprising:

a random access memory (115), and wherein:
each of said plurality of time stamped messages (120) is an error log file
message,
a relational data base process processes said plurality of error log file
messages into a set of relations (119
1
-119
i
 ) stored in said random access memory (115);
and 
said means for visually displaying a plurality of symbols displays non-textual
representations of said relations derived from said plurality of error log file

messages.
Apparatus according to claim 4, wherein:

said source characteristic of said set of at least three characteristics
designates a processor module of a plurality of processor modules (SM23 and SM25)

etc) that caused the error message, and
said message type characteristic of said set of at least three characteristics
designates a type of error which is described by the error log file message corresponding

to the symbol.
