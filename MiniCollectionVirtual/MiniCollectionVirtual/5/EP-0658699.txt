<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an end-fitting of a friction lining wear detection device, particularly for brake pads, designed to go over the end of an electrically conducting wire and to be inserted in an orifice formed for this purpose in a friction lining or rigidly attached to the lining carrier plate (backing plate). It is made as two half-shells (2, 3), formed by moulding, which can be joined together trapping the end of the electrically conducting wire.

End piece of a device for detecting
friction lining wear, particularly brake pad wear,

which is intended to fit over the end of an
electrically conducting wire and be inserted in an

orifice made for this purpose in a friction lining, or
held firmly on the backing plate of this lining, the

end piece being made as two half-shells (2, 3, 2', 3')
which can be joined together one against the other,

trapping the end of the electrically conducting wire,
characterized in that it comprises means providing a

seal between the two half-shells (2, 3).
End piece according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the sealing means comprise, on

one (2) of the two half-shells, a groove (14) located
along the peripheral edge of its face facing the other

half-shell (3), which groove a rib (15) made on the
peripheral edge of the face opposite belonging to the

other half-shell (3) enters.
End piece according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the two half-shells (2, 3) are

connected by a seal made of silicon mastic or some
other product which fulfils the same sealing function.
End piece according to any one of
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the two half-shells 

(2, 3) are welded together, for example using
ultrasonic or mirror welding.
End piece according to any one of
Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the two half-shells

(2, 3, 2', 3') are connected by a thin strip of
plastic (4, 5, 4', 5') which is preferably obtained at

the time of moulding the two half-shells (2, 3, 2', 3')
in a single operation, this strip (4, 5, 4', 5') acting

as a hinge about which the two half-shells (2, 3, 2',
3') can pivot one with respect to the other to close on

the electrically conducting wire.
End piece according to any one of
Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the two half-shells

(2, 3, 2', 3') each comprise a semi-cylindrical
housing (6, 7, 6', 7') intended to accommodate the

electrically conducting wire, the housing (6, 6') of
each half-shell (2) being located facing the housing

(7, 7') of the other half-shell (3) when these half-shells
are assembled to form the end piece (1).
End piece according to Claim 6,
characterized in that each semi-cylindrical housing (6,

7) ends, on the same side as the wearing face (10, 11)
of the end piece (1), in a cavity (12, 13) of larger

size, intended to accommodate an electric-contact piece
secured to the end of the electrically conducting wire.
End piece according to Claim 6, 
characterized in that each housing is a U-shaped groove

(6', 7').
End piece according to Claim 8,
characterized in that one of the two half-shells

comprises a means (13') for axially holding the
electrically conducting wire in the corresponding

groove (7').
End piece according to any one of
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that it comprises, on

its external lateral face, means (17) of retaining it
in the orifice formed for this purpose in the friction

lining.
