<ABSTRACT>
A shutter intended for use with a light-sensitive 
material. The shutter includes a light-blocking 

disk having a light-passing portion through 
which light can pass to reach a light-sensitive 

material. The disk is rotated to locate its light-passing 
portion in line with the light-sensitive 

material to allow light passing through the light-passing 
portion to advance towards the light-sensitive 

material. The shutter also includes a capping element 
which is moved between a light-blocking position and a 

non-light-blocking position relative to the light-sensitive 
material and the light-passing portion of the 

disk. A single sensor is used to detect a 
predetermined rotational position of the disk and in 

response thereto the capping element is moved from one 
of its light-blocking and non-light-blocking positions 

to the other.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field 
of still video image capture, and, more particularly, 
to a shutter intended for use with a light-sensitive 
material. Japanese Application No. 59-236445 filed in 
Japan on November 9, 1984 and entitled "Fast Mechanical 
Shutter", discloses a fast shutter part which rotates 
continuously. Also included is a photographic shutter 
part which operates intermittently and an electric 
circuit which (1) drives the fast shutter part and 
photographic shutter part by receiving an external 
image pickup command signal and (2) performs fast 
mechanical shutter operation. A slit 5b in the fast shutter part passes by 
a sensor 8 which then sends an indication signal for 
closure to a camera shutter 6. A slit 5c in the fast 
shutter part passes by a sensor 9 which then sends an 
indication signal for opening the camera shutter 6. A 
cut part 5a in the fast shutter part only passes 
through an optical path 10 after the slit 5c passes by 
the sensor 9 and before the slit 5b passes by the 
sensor 8 so that light 10 reaches an element 3'. The 
shutter speed is determined by the rotating speed of 
the disk and the angle of opening of the cut part 5a 
viewed from a center shaft of the disk. The fast mechanical shutter described above 
requires two sensors and two slits in the fast shutter 
part to effect opening and closing of the camera 
shutter 6. Having two sensors increases the cost of 
such a mechanical shutter. When sensor 9 detects slit 5c, cut part 5a in 
the mechanical shutter will have been rotated to a  
 
position almost 180 degrees from its position in Figure 
2. At this point camera shutter 6 will begin to open. 
Camera shutter 6 must be fully open by the time cut 
part 5a begins to sweep past element 3'. The fast 
shutter part is being rotated very quickly and camera 
shutter 6 must open during the time it takes the fast 
shutter part to rotate about 1/2 of a revolution. As a 
result, camera shutter 6 must be opened extremely 
quickly. Such rapid opening of the camera shutter is 
difficult to do and can damage parts due to high impact 
forces. These impact forces can also reduce image 
quality. This same problem exists when camera shutter 
6 is being closed. A further problem with the above described 
fast mechanical shutter is that the fast shutter part 
is not balanced for rotational stability. The fast 
shutter part will experience imbalanced centrifugal 
forces which can effect the rate of rotation of the 
fast shutter part and cause damage to various parts

<CLAIMS>
A shutter intended for use with a light-sensitive 
material, comprising: 

   a light-blocking disk having a light-passing 
portion through which light can pass to reach a light-sensitive 

material; 
   means for rotating said disk to locate its light-passing 

portion in line with the light-sensitive 
material to allow light passing through said light-passing 

portion to advance towards the light-sensitive 
material; 

   a capping element; 
   means, including a single sensor, for moving said 

capping element between a light-blocking position and a 
non-light-blocking position relative to the light-sensitive 

material and said light-passing portion of 
said disk; and 

   sensor means for detecting a predetermined 
rotational position of said disk and in response 

thereto moving said capping element from one of its 
light-blocking and non-light-blocking positions to the 

other. 
The shutter of claim 1, wherein 
detection of said predetermined rotational position by 

said sensor means is used to time movement of said 
capping element from one of its light-blocking and non-light-blocking 

positions to the other, such that said 
capping element has the maximum time to move from one 

of said positions to the other while said disk is 
blocking light from reaching said light-sensitive 

material. 
The shutter of claim 1, wherein 
detection of said predetermined rotational position by 

said sensor means is used to time actuation of a light 
flash such that said light flash is actuated when said 

capping element is in said non-light-blocking position 
 

and when said light-passing portion of said disk is in 
line with the light-sensitive material. 
The shutter of claim 1, wherein said 
disk has a portion removed to counterbalance said 

light-passing portion of said disk such that imbalanced 
centrifugal forces caused by rotating said disk are 

minimized. 
The shutter of claim 1, wherein said 
moving means includes a rotary solenoid, movement of 

said capping element from (1)said light-blocking 
position to said non-light-blocking position being 

caused by energizing said solenoid and (2) said non-light-blocking 
position to said light-blocking position 

being caused by deenergizing said solenoid thereby 
allowing a return spring to move said capping element 

towards said first position, said solenoid being 
momentarily energized as said capping element is moving 

toward said light-blocking position to decelerate said 
capping element and reduce impact forces on the capping 

element.
