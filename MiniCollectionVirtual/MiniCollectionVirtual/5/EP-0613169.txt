<ABSTRACT>
Spurious electrodynamic effects are reduced or 
eliminated by the use of a mechanically compact, low 

capacitance, geometrically symmetric, differentially-driven 
blanker assembly. This eliminates the need for 

internal cables or SMA-type launchers and has a solid 
metal electromechanical contact to system ground.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of minimizing beam jitter 
of an electronic beam in a double deflection beam blanker 
according to the preamble of claim 1, and a double deflection beam blanker 
according to the preamble of claim 5. Beam blanking is a required function for all electron 
beam systems used in lithography, testing, metrology, and 
inspection. Double deflection beam blankers are well 
known in the art, and are described, for example, in U.S. 
Patent 4,445,041 issued April 24, 1984 to Kelly et al. and EP-A-516098 
(U.S. Patent Appl. Serial No. 07/706,612, hereinafter 
Gesley 612). Double deflection beam blankers reduce beam 
positional jitter at the target due to electric field 
effects which occur during blanking. Beam positional jitter is minimized at the target by 
balancing the interaction of the blanker voltage and the 
electron transit time through the blanker. The double 
deflection beam blanker is configured as a matched 
impedance transmission line to minimize voltage 
reflections along the line, thereby reducing the electric 
field effects on the beam. The double deflection beam 
blanker reduces the beam transit time effect on positional 
accuracy at the substrate-target by producing a second, 
delayed impulse to the beam as it passes through the 
blanker assembly. However, a number of electrodynamic effects misplace 
the beam during and after the blanking operation, thereby 
producing spurious exposures in lithography or inaccurate 
measurements during inspection. One of these 
electrodynamic effects is a magnetic field interaction 
typically referred to as eddy currents. Typically, a  
 
blanker driver current indirectly interacts with the beam 
and generates a time-dependent magnetic field. This field 
in turn induces currents in neighboring conductors, such 
as the blanker housing. Eddy currents in these conductors 
then produce another magnetic field, commonly referred to 
as a B-field, which subsequently interacts with the 
electron beam on a much longer time scale, i.e. having 
exponential decay behavior. Even though individual pixel 
exposure times are small for photolithographic 
applications, e.g. with 160 MHz data rates that have 6.25 
nsec pixel dwell times, the induced time-dependent 
magnetic field generated by the eddy currents can have 
serious effects over relatively "long" times compared to 
the blanking transition, i.e. from microseconds to 
hundreds of milliseconds. Thus, these eddy currents 
undesirably influence the beam position at the target 
located
