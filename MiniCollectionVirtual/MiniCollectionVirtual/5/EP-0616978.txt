<ABSTRACT>
In the process for separating off organic pollutants, in particular biomass and non-biodegradable substances, from waste water (effluent), precipitants and flocculants are added to the waste water, the precipitant used being a combination of soluble iron compounds and aluminium compounds. Starting from a waste water having a COD of approximately 1300 mg/l, the precipitant used is a combination of this type of iron(III) chloride and aluminium(III) chloride, with which concentrations of about 650 mg/l of Fe

 ions and about 200 mg/l of Al

 ions are established. Depending on the solids content in the waste water, flocculant is added in an amount corresponding to a concentration in the waste water in the range from 0.1 to 3.0 mg/l, a pH in the region of about 6.0 being established. By the addition of an aluminium compound additionally to the iron compound, the concentration of the iron can be disproportionately reduced with constantly good COD decrease; moreover, the floc structure improves.
