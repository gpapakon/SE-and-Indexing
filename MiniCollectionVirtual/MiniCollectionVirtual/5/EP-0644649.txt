<ABSTRACT>
In a pulse width modulation amplifier used for acoustic 
reproduction apparatuses, an input side operational amplifier of a 

pulse width modulation amplifier is used as an alternating 
current amplifier by grounding its minus (-) terminal through a 

serial circuit formed of a resister and a capacitor.
 

By this circuit constitution, the direct current gain of the 
operational amplifier becomes 1, and the offset voltage decreases 

until inherent offset voltage of the operational amplifier itself. 
Since the operational amplifier has no direct current coupling 

with next amplifying stage, it does not make worse the offset 
voltage after the operational amplifier, so the offset voltage of 

the final output stage becomes smaller. 
Also, the negative feedback circuits connecting from the final 
output stage to the input of the operational amplifier include a 

low-pass filter whose capacitor is grounded and negative feedback 
signal is transmitted through a capacitor to the input of the 

operational amplifier so that direct current is cut.
 

By this circuit constitution, the influence of the carrier and its 
higher harmonics and other noises leaked to the operational amplifier 

through the feedback circuit can be decreased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pulse width modulation
amplifier used for amplifying the output power of acoustic
reproduction apparatuses and provides means for reducing the
output offset voltage and output noise.The conversion efficiency of pulse width modulation amplifiers is
higher than that of typical class A, AB, and B amplifiers. For
example, even the conversion factor of class B amplifiers which is
generally spoken as having good conversion factor, is around 70
%, while, that of pulse width modulation amplifier can be 85 - 90 %.
Accordingly, pulse width modulation amplifiers are widely used as low
frequency amplifiers of acoustic apparatuses for vehicle use or as low
frequency amplifiers for public address.Hereinafter, a conventional example of pulse width modulation
amplifier will be illustrated referring to drawings. Fig. 4 is a
block diagram showing whole constitution of a conventional
pulse width modulation amplifier. Pulse width modulation
signal is generated through comparing, by using a comparator 5,
the input signal amplified by an operational amplifier 1 and the
triangular wave generated by a triangular oscillator 4. This
pulse width modulation signal is amplified by a output stage
driving circuit 6 to drive a final output stage 7. The output of
the final output stage 7 is demodulated removing the carrier and
higher harmonic by low pass filters 8 and the low frequency output
power is supplied to a load 9.
In pulse width modulation amplifiers, FETs having low ON
resistance and low driving current compared with transistors are
widely employed as an amplifying device used in the output stage
driving circuit 6 and the final output stage 7. H bridge connection 
constitution formed by connecting FETs in a H bridge like is
generally employed in the final output stage 7.
Moreover, negative feedback is applied from the final output stage
to the operational amplifier for improving the distortion factor,
noise, etc., as an audio circuit. In these pulse width
modulation amplifiers, the carrier of the same frequency (
hereinafter carrier) as the oscillation frequency of the
triangular wave oscillator 4 must be eliminated before the
negative feedback, thus low-pass filters are included in the
feedback circuits 2 and 3.Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram showing around an operational
amplifier 1 in said conventional pulse width modulation
amplifier. A differential amplifier comprises an operational
amplifier 1, capacitors 13, 15, resisters 12, 14, 16, and 17.
Signal is input to an input terminal 10, passed
