<ABSTRACT>
A mounting arrangement for an ink jet 
printing device has a drop generator (10) for producing 

continuous streams of ink drops from at least one 
orifice in an array. The mounting arrangement 

comprises vertical slots (20) located perpendicular to 
the longitudinal axis of the array and body (16). One or 

more of the slots (20) may include a retaining portion (22) 
near a nodal plane of the resonator body (16). Hollow 

mounting tubes (18) are insertable into the retaining 
portion (22) in a press fit relationship.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to continuous ink jet printing 
systems and, more particularly, to an improved means for constructing 
a resonant body to provide a synchronous break up of jets in an array 
in such printing systems. In continuous ink jet printing, ink is supplied under pressure 
to a manifold region that distributes the ink to a plurality of 
orifices, typically arranged in a linear array(s). The ink discharges 
from the orifices in filaments which break into droplet streams. The 
approach for printing with these droplet streams is to selectively 
charge and deflect certain drops from their normal trajectories. In such continuous ink jet printing systems, graphic 
reproduction is accomplished by selectively charging and deflecting 
drops from the drop streams and depositing at least some of the drops 
on a print receiving medium while other of the drops strike a drop 
catcher device. In order to provide precise charging and deflecting of 
the drops, it is important that the drop break-up process produce 
uniformly sized and timed drops. Drop generators for such printers 
produce the required drop formation by vibrating the orifices from 
which the ink emerges. In the field of ink jet printers, it is desirable from the 
standpoint of throughput to  
 
utilize long arrays of ink jets. For example, U.S. Patent No. 
4,999,647 discloses a system for achieving synchronous stimulation 
across a long array at a low frequency, approximately 50 KHz. The 
system of that patent uses a rectangular solid printhead body of high 
acoustic Q material, stainless steel, with vertical slots perpendicular 
to the array to provide a plurality of approximately identical resonant 
bodies. The slots are spaced equidistant from each other to provide 
for uniform vibrational amplitude across the major surface. The slots 
divide the drop generator into segments so that segment height, in the 
predominant vibration direction, is greater than the other dimensions 
of each segment. As described in the '647 patent, an ink manifold and orifice 
plate are located at one of the longitudinal ends parallel to the 
overall greatest length of the resonant body. The orifice plate 
provides for a continuous stream of jets to form drops at a frequency 
equivalent to the resonance of the body. The resonant body is excited 
by piezoelectric strip pairs mechanically attached to the sides so as 
to expand and contract in the desired direction. The resonator is 
mounted at the nodal plane by means of solid pins that are pressed into 
ho

A mounting arrangement for a drop generator (10) of an ink jet 
printing device, the generator having a resonator body (16) and an 

orifice array having a common longitudinal axis with said body, the 
generator capable of producing continuous streams of ink drops from at 

least one said orifice, the mounting arrangement comprising: 

slots (20) located in the resonant body perpendicular to the 
longitudinal axis of the array and body; and characterised by, 
a retaining portion (22), associated with a nodal plane of the 
resonator body, located in at least one of the slots (20); and 
at least one mounting member (18) insertable into the retaining 
portion and said mounting member is at least partially hollow. 
A mounting arrangement as claimed in claim 1, wherein the at 
least one mounting member (18) comprises a mounting tube, and a solid 

material is provided in an end portion of the at least one mounting 
tube at a clamp point to prevent distortion of the tube during 

clamping.  
 
A mounting arrangement as claimed in any one preceding claim, 
wherein the resonator body (16) has at least one interior segment (24a, 

b, c) defined by adjacent pairs of slots (20), and end segments (26a, 
b) between each end slot (20a, b) and each end of the resonator body, 

each interior segment having a greater width, measured parallel to the 
longitudinal axis of the resonator body, dimension than a height 

dimension, and each end segment being narrower in width than each 
interior segment.
