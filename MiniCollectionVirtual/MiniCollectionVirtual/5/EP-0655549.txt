<ABSTRACT>
A preform element, such as a cutting element for a drag-type drill bit, includes 
a facing table (22) of superhard material having a front face (23), a peripheral surface, 

and a rear surface (27) bonded to a substrate (21) which is less hard than the superhard 
material. The rear surface of the facing table is integrally formed with a plurality of ribs 

(25) which project into the substrate (21) and extend in directions outwardly away from 
an inner area of the facing table towards the peripheral surface thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to elements faced with superhard material, and particularly
to preform elements comprising a facing table of superhard material having a front face,
a peripheral surface, and a rear surface bonded to a substrate of material which is less
hard than the superhard material.Preform elements of this kind are often used as cutting elements on rotary drag-type
drill bits, and the present invention will be particularly described in relation to such
use. However, the invention is not restricted to cutting elements for this particular use,
and may relate to preform elements for other purposes. For example, elements faced
with superhard material, of the kind referred to, may also be employed in workpiece-shaping
tools, high pressure nozzles, wire-drawing dies, bearings and other parts subject
to sliding wear, as well as elements subject to percussive loads as may be the case in
tappets, cams, cam followers, and similar devices in which a surface of high wear
resistance is required.Preform elements used as cutting elements in rotary drill bits usually have a
facing table of polycrystalline diamond, although other superhard materials are available,
such as cubic boron nitride. The substrate of less hard material is often formed from
cemented tungsten carbide, and the facing table and substrate are bonded together
during formation of the element in a high pressure, high temperature forming press. This
forming process is well known and will not be described in detail.Each preform cutting element may be mounted on a carrier in the form of a
generally cylindrical stud or post received in a socket in the body of the drill bit. The 
carrier is often formed from cemented tungsten carbide, the surface of the substrate
being brazed to a surface on the carrier, for example by a process known as "LS
bonding". Alternatively, the substrate itself may be of sufficient thickness as to provide,
in effect, a cylindrical stud which is sufficiently long to be directly received in a socket
in the bit body, without being brazed to a carrier. The bit body itself may be machined
from metal, usually steel, or may be moulded using a powder metallurgy process.Such cutting elements are subjected to extremes of temperature during formation
and mounting on the bit body, and are also subjected to high temperatures and heavy
loads when the drill is in use down a borehole. It is found that as a result of such
conditions spalling and delamination of the superhard facing table can occur, that is to
say the separation and loss
