<ABSTRACT>
Toothbrush in which the height of the bristles, present 
on its head, decreases progressively, from its lateral 

edges (2,2') towards the longitudinal axis, with the result 
that the free tips of the bristles form an elongated 

hollow (3), which runs parallel to the longitudinal axis of 
the head.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a toothbrush the 
structure of which is conceived in such a way as to 
produce a thorough cleaning and massaging action on the 
gingival structures in addition to the customary 
cleaning of the interdental spaces. The results of recent studies indicate that the main 
problem in adults is not so much tooth decay as a 
deterioration of the gum tissue, particularly the 
gingival margin and the alveolar gum. With advancing age 
the gums tend to retract, with consequent greater 
exposure of the crowns and alveolar processes, and the 
end result of such deterioration may be tooth loss. For many years the improvements made to the structure of 
toothbrushes have reflected the greater degree of 
emphasis placed, in oral hygiene, on the treatment of a 
population consisting mostly of young people for whom, 
as mentioned above, the main problem is tooth decay. With such toothbrushes an attempt has therefore been 
made to improve the cleaning of the interdental spaces 
and reach the rearmost molars with greater ease and 
comfort for the user (particularly if very young), even  
 
in subjects with a tight rim of the mouth and cramped 
vestibular space. This result, however, is often 
achieved without producing a proper parallel cleaning 
and massaging of the gums, and even at the expense of an 
abrasive, irritant action on the gingival tissues, which 
dissuades the user from insisting on thorough, 
hygienically correct cleaning. With the toothbrushes currently in use, the situation is 
further worsened when it comes to proper cleaning of the 
rear surface of the dental arch and the corresponding 
internal gingival areas, since the user is "naturally" 
inclined to neglect them, confining the cleaning to the 
brushing of the front surface. This phenomenon is further aggravated in children, who 
may experience unpleasant self-provoked retching by 
prodding the base of the tongue with the plastic part of 
the toothbrush in an attempt to reach the rear surface 
of the teeth in the innermost areas of the mouth, and 
this retching may induce them to neglect the less easily 
accessible zones of the oral cavity. These drawbacks are all overcome by the toothbursh of 
the present invention, which allows not only the 
cleaning of the interdental spaces, but also a thorough 
cleaning, profound massaging and consequent reactivation 
of the circulation of the gum tissues, particularly the  
 
gingival margin and the alveolar gum, even in the 
innermost areas of the mouth without any discomfort to

<CLAIMS>
Toothbrush comprising a head, handle and bristle set, 
characterized by the fact that the bristle set comprises 

two subset of bristles (S,S') in each of which the 
height of the bristles decreases progressively from the 

edges (2,2') of the head (1) towards its longitudinal 
axis, with the result that the tips of the bristles form 

an elongated hollow (3), which runs parallel to the 
longitudinal axis of the head. 
The toothbrush of claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the hollow (3) is rounded. 
The toothbrush of claim 1, characterized by the fact 
that the hollow (3) is flat sided. 
The toothbrush of the foregoing claims, characterized 
by the above descriptions and illustrations.
