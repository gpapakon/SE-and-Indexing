<CLAIMS>
Cooling-air cooling unit for a gas turbine, 
whereby tube sheets (4, 7) are provided to support 

tubes (5) to separate the air to be cooled from a heat-absorbing 
medium, whereby the tube sheets (4, 7) divide 

air-filled chambers (1, 6) from an area filled with the 
heat-absorbing medium, and whereby at least the tube 

sheet (4) facing the inlet side of the air to be cooled 
and bordering an air inlet chamber (1) is fixed on one 

side, in that an annular suspension (2) closed in the 
circumferential direction issues from the edge of the 

tube sheet (4) in the axial direction and connects the 
tube sheet (4) to the casing of the container (3), 

characterized in that the suspension has a clearly 
smaller thickness than the tube sheet (4) and in that 

in the tube sheet (4) itself, next to the contact point 
with the suspension (2), a circumferential groove is 

provided. 
Cooling-air cooling unit according to claim 1, 
characterized in that a cross section enclosed by the 

casing of the container (3) in the region of the 
contact point with the suspension (2) is changed 

gradually, so that between the casing of the container 
(3) on the one hand and on the other hand the tube 

sheet (4) and the suspension (2) an annular area (16) 
is formed. 
Cooling-air cooling unit according to one of 
claims 1 or 2, characterized in that the edge of the 

tube sheet (4) has a circumferential collar extending 
towards the contact point with the suspension (2).
