<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for denaturing allergens in the
environment. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a composition for denaturing
allergens and to the use of a rare earth metal salt for denaturing allergens.A lot of people suffered from allergic diseases like asthma, atopic dermatitis
and so on for long years. Mainly house dust mites that live in the house, hair of pets
and various kinds of pollens can be the substances that cause these allergic diseases.
Recently, during the treatment of those, medicines are applied to allergic patients. On the
other hands, removing allergens which cause allergic disease from the environment
where allergic patients live is also a useful method that protects from the exposure to
allergens. It is reported in Japan, Europe and the United States of America that
removing allergens can improve the condition of patients.Cleaning using a vacuum cleaner or an air conditioner and the use of
high-density covers on the bedclothes are applied for removing allergens. However, a
vacuum cleaner cannot remove all of the allergens that exist in the house, and an air
conditioner can remove allergens that exist only in the atmosphere. Further,
high-density cover merely protects allergens inside of bedclothes and is not useful for
the allergens that come from the environment. Therefore, these methods are not
fully satisfying.Recently the methods for chemically denaturing allergens have been developed.
For example, methods that use tannic acid (JP Hei-02-016731A) and extracts of
tea leaf, gallic acid and so on are proposed. However, it is hard to get steady
effectiveness for denaturing allergens using these proposed methods. Furthermore, these
methods have the disadvantage of causing coloring on the materials treated with the
proposed denaturing agent.Generally acaricides are used for controlling house dust mites. However,
house dust mites, such as Dermatophagoides farinae, Dermatophagoides
pteronyssinus, and so on can be the source of allergens even after death and the
dead bodies of house dust mites gradually decompose and release fine particles of
allergens. As a result, controlling of house dust mites by applying acaricides is not
always useful to remove allergens from the environment.US-A-5,900,257 discloses cosmefic/dermatological/phannaceufical compositions, which are
said to be suited for the treatment of a variety of special mammalian disorders. The
compositions comprise at least one salt of yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium,
neodymium, promethium,
