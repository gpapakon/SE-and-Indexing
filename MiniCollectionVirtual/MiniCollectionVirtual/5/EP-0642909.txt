<ABSTRACT>
A method of forming a component having a metallic 
shell 12 and a plastics insert 34. The component is 

formed by placing the shell 12 inside the mould cavity of 
a mould assembly 10 which forms part of an injection 

moulding machine. Prior to injection of plastics 
material, part of the external surface of the shell 12 is 

spaced from the opposed surface of the mould cavity. The 
open end of the shell abuts the adjacent mould cavity end 

wall so as to form a seal. This end wall is frustoconical 
in shape so that, during injection of plastics material, 

as the shell 12 is reformed by polymer pressure into 
complete engagement with the surface of the mould cavity, 

longitudinal contraction of the shell in response to this 
direct lateral strain is compensated for by the 

frustoconical shape so that the seal is not compromised.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of making a
component of the type comprising a metallic shell closed
at one end and an insert of a polymeric material located
within the shell.In many types of component such as a closure member
for a container, the component comprises simply a
metallic shell or a metallic shell formed with a
relatively thin lining of a suitable material by a
coating process, such as a metal/polymer laminate. For
most purposes, such components are satisfactory. However,
for some types of components, particularly closure
members for high quality containers such as perfume
bottles, the closure member takes the form of a metallic
shell and an insert of substantial thickness which is
formed from a polymeric material and is located within
the shell. Conventionally, the metallic shell and the
insert are formed separately, adhesive is applied to the
shell and/or the insert and the insert is then placed in
position in the shell. However, this method of making a
closure member suffers from the disadvantage that it
requires several manufacturing stages and is
correspondingly expensive.Whilst it is therefore desirable to form the insert
by moulding it in situ within the shell, in a
conventional moulding process it is difficult to maintain
consistent sealing integrity of the shell within the
mould, so as to prevent leakage of polymeric material
during moulding beyond the end of the shell. It is also
difficult to achieve satisfactory location of the insert
in the shell after the polymeric material has cooled and
undergone shrinkage. It may be desired to form relief features on the
shell for decorative or other purposes, but to form such
features as a separate operation on the shell prior to
inserting it into the mould cavity would involve
additional manipulative and manufacturing stages and may
require angular orientation of the shell in relation to
the mould cavity. It has been found that over a wide
range of thicknesses of the shell material the polymer
pressures which are conventionally used in injection-moulding
may be employed to reform the shell outwardly
into one or more recesses which are suitably provided in
the mould cavity wall. Thus at the same time as the
insert is being moulded, the shell may be formed with one
or more relief features (i.e. protuberances) which may
serve both for decorative purposes and for mechanically
locking the insert against substantial movement within
the shell to prevent or reduce relative movement.US-A-2131319 describes a closure cap having a

A method of manufacturing a component by injection
moulding an insert (34) of polymeric material into a

metal shell closed at one end, the shell (12) being
located within a mould cavity (14) and the open end (32)

of the shell (12) engaging a frustoconical portion (33)
of the mould cavity wall (20) to form a seal therebetween

whereby, when polymer is admitted at high pressure to the
interior of the shell (12) to form the insert (34)

therein, longitudinal contraction of the shell (12) is
compensated for by the frustoconical portion (33) of the

mould, thereby maintaining the integrity of the seal.
A method of manufacturing a component by injection
moulding an insert (34) of polymeric material into a

metal shell (12) closed at one end, the shell (12) being
located within a mould cavity (14) and the open end (32)

of the shell (12) engaging the mould cavity end wall (33)
to form a seal therebetween and the shell (12) being

compressed longitudinally whereby, when polymer is
admitted at high pressure to the interior of the shell

(12) to form the insert (34) therein, longitudinal
contraction of the shell (12) releases the compression

without the shell (12) disengaging the cavity end wall
(33) and breaking the seal.
A method according to claim 2, in which the cavity
end wall (33) is frustoconical. 
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3, in
which the open end (114) of the shell (112) is turned

inwardly and engages the mould cavity wall (20) within
the shell (12) for the moulding operation.
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 4,
further comprising relieving the mould cavity (14)

locally at one or more recesses (26, 28) and locating the
shell (12) with the recesses in spaced opposition to the

outside surface of the shell (12), whereby the pressure
of the polymer causes the shell (12) to be expanded into

substantial conformity with the recesses (26, 28) to form
one or more relief features thereon.
