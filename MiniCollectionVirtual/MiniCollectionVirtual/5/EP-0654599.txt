Device for exhaust gas recirculation, with a valve (11) 
and a conduit (15) with a conduit section (16) 

approximately coaxial to the valve (11), said conduit 
section being connected to the end of the valve housing 

(14) via an intermediate piece (21) made of a welding or 
soldering material and connected to the end of the 

conduit section (16) by means of welding or soldering, 
for which purpose the intermediate piece (21) engages on 

the valve housing (14) with an end section or collar or 
ring facing the valve housing (14), characterised in 

that the intermediate piece (21; 121; 221; 321; 421) is 
firmly attached to the end (13) of the valve housing 

(14; 114; 214; 314; 414) such that its end section (24; 
124) is anchored in the valve housing (14; 114) by being 

cast into its material; or that its collar (233; 333) 
positively engages into an approximately corresponding 

annular groove (234; 334) in a cylindrical shoulder 
(231; 331) of the valve housing (214; 314); or that its 

ring (430) is held in press fit on the outer peripheral 
surface of a cylindrical shoulder (431) of the valve 

housing (414).  
 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
intermediate piece (221; 321; 421) is formed from a ring 

(230; 330; 430) having the collar (233; 333) directed 
radially inwards. 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
ring (230) is cast into the annular groove (234) of the 

valve housing (214). 
Device according to Claim 2, characterised in that the 
ring (330) with the collar (333) engages into the 

annular groove (334) because at the end pointing to a 
fastening flange (322) of the conduit section (316), the 

cylindrical shoulder (331) is beaded from the inside 
outwards and thus behind the collar (333). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the 
intermediate piece (21; 121) is formed from a pipe 

portion (23; 123), the end section (24; 124) of which is 
preferably oriented coaxially to the valve housing (14; 

114). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterised in that the 
pipe portion (23; 123) has a flange (25; 125) connecting 

to the end section (24; 124) and directed radially 
outwards. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the conduit section (16; 116; 216; 316; 416) is 

connected to the intermediate piece (21; 121; 221; 321; 
421) by resistance welding. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the conduit section (16; 116; 216; 316; 416) is 

connected to the intermediate piece (21; 121; 221; 321; 
421) by fusion welding.  

 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterised 
in that the conduit section (16; 116; 216; 316; 416) is 

connected to the intermediate piece (21; 121; 221; 321; 
421) by hard soldering. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the intermediate piece (21; 121; 221; 321; 421) 

is formed from alloyed steel. 
Device according to one of Claims I to 10, characterised 
in that the intermediate piece (21; 121; 221; 321; 421) 

is formed from high temperature steel. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised 

in that the valve housing (14; 114; 214; 314; 414) is 
formed from aluminium die casting. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 12, characterised 
in that the conduit section (16; 116; 216; 316; 416) has 

a fastening flange (22; 122; 222; 322; 422) directed 
radially outwards. 
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 13, characterised 
in that the flange (25) of the pipe portion (23) abuts 

against the fastening flange (22) of the conduit section 
(16), and both flanges (25, 22) are connected to one 

another by means of a resistance ring weld (26). 
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 14, characterised 
in that a flange (25, 22), in particular the flange (25) 

of the pipe portion (23), has a circumferential bead 
(27) projecting towards the fastening flange (22), and 

in the region of said bead the resistance ring weld (26) 
is formed, preferably by removal of the bead (27).  

 
Device according to one of Claims 6 to 13, characterised 
in that a further coaxial pipe portion (128) is 

connected in one piece onto the flange (125) of the pipe 
portion (123), said further pipe portion abutting 

axially on the fastening flange (122) of the conduit 
section (116) with its free end edge (129), and being 

connected there to the fastening flange (122) by means 
of welding, in particular resistance welding. 
Device according to Claims 2 to 13, characterised in
