<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for rapping electrodes (6), 
preferably collecting electrodes, in a high voltage supplied 

electrostatic precipitator, which device comprises at least 
one piezo electric element (2) adapted to supply a rapping 

impact to at least one electrode, said piezo electric element 
being connected to a voltage source enabling it to supply an 

impact of a predetermined level and frequency. The invention 
further relates to an electrostatic precipitator comprising 

a housing, a suspension arrangement mounted in the housing, 
discharge and collecting electrodes suspended in said 

arrangement and at least one of the above mentioned devices, 
which device is mounted in the precipitator in a manner so as 

to apply impact or vibration force to at least one electrode 
(6) when a voltage diffential is applied from the voltage 

field, and still further to a method of cleaning electrodes 
in such an electrostatic precipitator by applying a voltage 

differential to each piezo electric element, said voltage 
differential being controllable from the area outside the 

electrostatic precipitator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for cleaning electrodes,
preferably collecting electrodes, of a high-voltage supplied.
electrostatic precipitator comprising a precipitator housing
and a suspension arrangement for the electrodes mounted in
the precipitator housing.The invention further relates to an electrostatic precipitator
using such devices and a method of cleaning the
electrodes in a precipitator of this type. Such precipitators
are used for cleaning smoke gasses from the combustion of
fossil fuels, waste materials and the like in for instance
power supply plants, combustion plants or cement plants.Due to the operation mode of such precipitators dust is
deposited on the electrodes and in particular on the collecting
electrodes during the operation. This is well known in
the art. In order to ensure the efficiency of the precipitator
these electrodes need to be regularly cleaned of the
deposited dust. This is normally effected by rapping or
vibrating the electrodes.The impact required for rapping or vibrating the electrodes
is usually produced by a number of hammers being lifted by a
rotating shaft extending across the precipitator width from
their vertically suspended position and subsequently being
released so as to revert to their vertical position. For each
hammer an impact rod or an impact beam is provided which is
hit by the hammer when the latter reverts to its vertical
position and from the impact rod/beam the supplied impact
energy is transmitted to a section of precipitator electrodes.The collecting electrodes usually consist of vertically 
suspended, narrow and substantially rectangular plates which
at their upper ends are secured to a suspension device in a
precipitator housing containing the electrodes. The latter
may be mounted in mutually parallel rows or precipitator
sections, and the rapping is effected for the separate
sections by means of drop hammers and impact rods for each
section. Rapping devices of this type are known, e.g. from
Duda: "Cement Data Handbook", 3rd. edition, pp. 596-598
(Bauverlag Gmbh - Wiesbaden und Berlin 1985) and from patent
publications Nos. US-A-3,844,742 and EP-A-0398476.In the so-called European type electrostatic precipitators
drop hammers and impact rods connected to the lower ends of
the collecting electrodes are generally used, which is
associated with the drawback that the hammers and their
carrier bridges occupy comparatively much space at the end of
and below the precipitator section which, in turn, requires
an increased length and height of the
