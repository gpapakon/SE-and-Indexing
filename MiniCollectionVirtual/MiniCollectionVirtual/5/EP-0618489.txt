<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic film improved 
in its antistatic property so as to be less affected by the 
change of humidity. It can be used for a magnetic tape, a 
floppy disk, a flexible board, a substrate for a membrane 
switch and a recording sheet for a printer. Since a film 
transparent sufficiently can be made, it can be used for an 
OHP film, a liquid crystal display apparatus, a touch panel 
and a stained glass. In addition, it can also be used for a 
photographic light-sensitive material because the excellent 
degree of clearness of the plastic film does not adversely 
affect the photographic characteristics of the photographic 
light-sensitive material. Because of commonly strong static charge build-up, 
plastic films have been hitherto often limited in their use  
 
other than the use taking advantage of such properties. For 
example, light-sensitive photographic materials commonly make 
use of plastic film as a support having electrical insulation 
properties. Such materials belong to what is called composite 
materials, comprised of a support and a light-sensitive 
photographic material layer. Hence the light-sensitive 
photographic materials tend to be statically charged when, 
during their manufacture and use, they come into contact with 
the surface of a material of the same or different kind or 
they are separated therefrom. Most static charges accumulated 
as a result of static charging cause various difficulties. 
The most important difficulty is what is called static marks, 
which are spots or branch-type or feather-type lines occurring 
during the photographic processing of the light sensitive 
photographic materials whose light-sensitive silver halide 
emulsion layers have been sensitized as a result of the 
discharge of static electricity accumulated before the 
photographic processing. When, for example, this phenomenon 
occurs in medical or industrial X-ray films, it leads to a 
very dangerous determination. This phenomenon becomes known 
only when the photographic films have been processed, and is 
one of very difficult problems. These accumulated static 
charges may also cause troubles such that dust adheres to a 
plastic film surface and no uniform coating on the film 
surface can be carried out.  Such troubles caused by static charging may also occur in 
many cases besides the foregoing. For example, in the course 
of manufacture, the troubles may be caused by contact friction 
between photographic films and rollers, and by separation of 
emulsion sides from
