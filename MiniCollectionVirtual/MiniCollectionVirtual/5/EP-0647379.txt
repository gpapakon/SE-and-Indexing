<ABSTRACT>
In this method of switching digital signals (DS) in a synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH) or plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH), the digital signals are inserted into a DSM base pulse frames (PR1). This pulse frame consists of 9 lines (Z) and 100 columns (S). The DSM data words transmitted each comprise 9 bits, made up of 8 bits of meaningful information and one bit of additional data. By interlacing several DSM pulse frames (PR1), higher-order DSM-N pulse frames (PRN) can be produced.

<CLAIMS>
Method for switching through digital signals (DS) 
in an SDH network (SDH: Synchronous Digital Hierarchy), 

characterized in that the digital signals (DS) are 
inserted into DSM pulse frames (PRN) which have - in two-dimensional 

representation - in each case 9 lines 
(Z1...Z9) and 100 N (N = 1, 2, 3, ...) columns, it being 

possible to transmit a DSM data word comprising 9 bits in 
every position of a column, of which an octet comprising 

8 bits is used for transmitting the digital signal (DS). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a further bit for transmitting monitoring and 

control information is provided for each octet of the 
digital signal. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a DSM base pulse frame (PR1) comprises 9 lines and 

100 columns. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that higher-order DSM pulse frames (PRN, N ≥≥ 2) are 

generated by column-by-column interlacing of DSM base 
pulse frames (PR1). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that digital signals (AU-4) having 

higher data rates of the synchronous digital hierarchy 
are distributed over a plurality of DSM base pulse frames 

(PR1). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the STM-1 signal and each DSM pulse 

frame (PRN) have the same period length (125 µs). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims,  
 

characterized in that the ratio of the system clock 
frequencies of the STM-1 frames and the DSM base pulse 

frames (PR1) is 12 to 5. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that four successive DSM-N pulse frames 

(PRN) form one DSM multiframe.
