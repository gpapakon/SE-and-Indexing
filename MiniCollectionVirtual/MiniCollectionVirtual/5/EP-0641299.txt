<ABSTRACT>
In a process for skeletal isomerization of linear olefins to iso-olefins, e.g., n-butenes to isobutylene, over a catalyst comprising medium pore zeolite, e.g., a zeolite selected from ZSM-22, ZSM-23, and ZSM-35, the zeolite is pretreated with a dicarboxylic acid, e.g., oxalic acid. The pretreatment significantly reduces aging rate and increases cycle length of the catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
skeletal isomerization of n-olefin-containing, e.g., 
n-butene-containing, hydrocarbon streams to 
iso-olefin-rich, e.g., isobutene-rich product streams. The demand for iso-alkenes has recently increased 
in response to a greater demand for oxygenated 
gasoline additives. For example, relatively large 
amounts of isobutene are required for reaction with 
methanol or ethanol over an acidic catalyst to produce 
methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) or ethyl tert-butyl 
ether (ETBE) which is useful as an octane enhancer for 
unleaded gasolines. Isoamylenes are required for 
reaction with methanol over an acidic catalyst to 
produce tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME). With passage 
of the Clean Air Act in the United States mandating 
increased gasoline oxygenate content, MTBE, ETBE and 
TAME have taken on new value as clean-air additives, 
even for lower octane gasolines. Lead phasedown of 
gasolines in Western Europe has further increased the 
demand for such oxygenates. An article by J.D. Chase, et al., Oil and Gas 
Journal, April 9, 1979, discusses the advantages which 
can be achieved by using such materials to enhance 
gasoline octane. The blending octane values of MTBE 
when added to a typical unleaded gasoline base fuel 
are RON = 118, MON = 101, R+M / 2 = 109. The blending 
octane values of TAME when added to a typical unleaded 
gasoline base fuel are RON = 112, MON = 99, R+M / 2 = 
106. Isobutene (or isobutylene) is in particularly 
high demand as it is reacted with methanol to produce 
MTBE. The addition of shape-selective zeolite additives 
such as ZSM-5 to cracking catalysts, e.g. those used 
in fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC), is beneficial 
in producing gasoline boiling range product of  
 
increased octane rating. However, increased amounts 
of olefins result, including n-butenes, creating a 
need for their conversion to higher value products 
such as isobutene which can be used to produce MTBE. Butene exists in four isomers: butene-1, 
cis-butene-2, its stereo-isomer trans-butene-2, and 
isobutene. Conversion between the butene-2 isomers is 
known as geometric isomerization, whereas that between 
butene-1 and the butene-2 isomers is known as position 
isomerization, double-bond migration, or hydrogen-shift 
isomerization. The aforementioned three butene 
isomers are not branched and are known collectively as 
normal or n-butenes. Conversion of the n-butenes to 
isobutene, which is a branched isomer, is widely known 
as skeletal isomerization. The reaction
