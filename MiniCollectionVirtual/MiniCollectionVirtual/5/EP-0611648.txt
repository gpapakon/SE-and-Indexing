<ABSTRACT>
The system of the present invention controls the 
temperature of ink so as to enhance print quality. An 

ink roller has a circulation path therein. A circulation 
system circulates fluid, such as water, through the ink 

roller and through a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger 
is part of a refrigeration and heating system that 

selectively cools and heats the circulating water. The 
refrigeration and heating system uses a compressor, an 

expansion valve and the heat exchanger. To provide 
refrigeration, refrigerant fluid is circulated in the 

refrigeration and heating system through the expansion 
valve and to the heat exchanger. To provide heating, the 

expansion valve is bypassed by a conduit, wherein hot 
fluid from the compressor flows directly to the heat 

exchanger.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to printing presses, 
and more particularly, to systems for controlling the 
temperature of fluids in printing presses. In traditional lithographic printing presses, ink 
and dampening fluid are applied by rollers onto a 
lithographic printing plate. The printing plate is 
mounted onto a plate cylinder which rotates the printing 
plate past the ink and dampening rollers. The printing 
plate contains oleophilic and hydrophilic areas. The 
oleophilic areas are arranged according to the desired 
image which is to be printed onto media such as paper. 
The oleophilic areas attract the oil-based ink. Nonprint 
areas on the printing plate attract the water-based 
dampening fluid and repel the ink. In order to achieve satisfactory printing, a proper 
balance must be achieved between the amount of dampening 
fluid applied to the plate versus the amount of ink that 
is applied. If too much dampening fluid is applied, then 
the print areas look faded, as the dampening fluid begins 
to be applied to the oleophilic areas. If too little 
dampening fluid is applied, then the ink appears in 
nonink areas. Much effort has gone into the systems that 
apply dampening fluid to a plate, in order to achieve 
this balance. One type of inking system that is used is referred 
to as waterless printing by the printing industry. In 
waterless printing, dampening fluid is not used. 
Instead, only special inks are applied to the plate on  
 
the plate cylinder. The nonprint areas of the plate are 
coated with a silicone rubber film, which will not 
attract the ink under normal operating conditions. In 
order to maintain the ink away from the nonprint areas of 
the plate, the ink must be maintained within a certain 
temperature range. For example, some inks must be 
maintained within just a few degrees of 80 degrees 
Fahrenheit. If the ink becomes too cool or too warm, 
then its viscosity changes and the proper application of 
ink to the plate becomes increasingly difficult. Printing presses are subjected to wide temperature 
ranges. For example, when a press is started first thing 
in the morning, it typically is below the desired ink 
temperature range for waterless printing. This is 
because the press has been sitting all night and has had 
a chance to cool off. As the press begins to operate, 
heat is generated by the friction between its rollers and 
also by the electric drive motors. The heat that is 
generated causes the temperature of the ink to increase 
beyond the desired temperature range for
