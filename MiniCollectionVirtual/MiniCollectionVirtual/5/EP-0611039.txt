<ABSTRACT>
A novel process for preparing titanium dioxide from a titanium 
chloride consists of heating an aqueous solution of the titanium 

chloride in the presence of a salt of a polycarboxylic acid. The process 
is useful for producing titanium dioxide having a particle size between 

0.1 and 1 micrometre and a purity which is suitable for more 
demanding electroceramic applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This patent relates to a process for the preparation of titanium 
dioxide and in particular to a process for the conversion of a titanium 
chloride to titanium dioxide by hydrolysis in aqueous solution. Titanium dioxide is a useful material for the preparation of 
electroceramic materials such as barium titanate and lead zirconate 
titanate. It is desirable for the preparation of these electroceramic 
materials to use titanium dioxide with a high level of purity and a 
controlled particle size. High purity titanium dioxide powders are known but, generally, 
the average particle size of available powders is either substantially less 
than 0.1 micrometre or substantially greater than 1 micrometre. 
Titanium dioxide pigments having an average particle size generally 
within the range 0.1 to 1 micrometre are well known but, generally, 
these powders are not sufficiently pure for electroceramic applications 
since additives are normally used to control the particle size. Hydrolysis of aqueous solutions of titanium chlorides to form 
particulate titanium dioxide is well known but the process has not 
hitherto been employed for the preparation of titanium dioxide having 
the controlled particle size and purity required for the more 
demanding electroceramic applications. According to the invention a process for the preparation of 
titanium dioxide comprises heating an aqueous solution of a titanium 
chloride in the presence of a salt of a polymeric carboxylic acid. Surprisingly, this process results in a form of titanium dioxide in 
which any aggregates present are readily broken down to produce a 
powder having an average particle size between 0.1 and 1 micrometre. The process utilises an aqueous solution of a titanium chloride. 
This can be prepared in any convenient manner but typically, it is 
formed by dilution of anhydrous titanium tetrachloride with water or 
hydrochloric acid. The concentration of the titanium chloride solution can vary 
widely and depends, to some extent, on the amount of hydrochloric 
acid, if any, used. Generally, the concentration will be equivalent to  
 
from 100 to 500 grams of TiO₂ per litre and, preferably, the 
concentration is equivalent to from 300 to 500 grams of TiO₂ per litre . The hydrolysis of the titanium chloride is brought about by 
heating in the presence of a salt of a polymeric carboxylic acid. 
Suitable salts include ammonium or alkali metal salts of polycarboxylic 
acids such as sodium polyacrylate, ammonium polyacrylate and sodium 
carboxymethyl cellulose. The
