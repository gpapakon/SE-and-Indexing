<ABSTRACT>
A data switch interconnects a number of data processing
nodes. The switch includes a number of port units for

interfacing with the processing nodes, a number of
multiplexing units for performing the switching, and a

connection control unit. When a port unit wishes to initiate
a connection, it sends a connection command over a command

bus to all the multiplexing units and to the connection
control unit, specifying a proposed data connection. Each

multiplexing unit responds to the connection command by
preparing the proposed data connection. At the same time,

the connection control unit checks whether the proposed data
connection is permissible. If it is permissible, the

connection control unit then sends a GO signal to all the
multiplexing units instructing them to complete the prepared

connection.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to data switching apparatus, for
interconnecting a number of data processing nodes.There is a requirement for a data switch that can reliably
handle connections between a number of data processing nodes,
at high speed.The object of the invention is to provide a data switch of
novel construction, which is capable of solving this problem.According to the invention there is provided data switching
apparatus comprising:
(a) a command bus, (b) a plurality of port units connected to the command bus,
each port unit including means for sending a connection
command on the command bus specifying source and
destination ports for a required data connection,(c) a plurality of multiplexing units connected to the
command bus, each multiplexing unit being arranged to
respond to a connection command on the bus by preparing
a data connection between the ports specified by that
command, and(d) a connection control unit connected to the command bus,
for checking whether the data connection specified by 
the connection command is permissible and, if it is
permissible, sending a control signal to all the
multiplexing units instructing them to complete the
prepared connection.As will be seen, the invention allows preparation of a data
connection to proceed in parallel with checking whether the
connection is permissible, thus leading to faster operation.Figure 1 is an overall block diagram of a data switch
embodying the invention.One data switch in accordance with the invention will now be
described by way of example with reference to the
accompanying drawing.Referring to Figure 1, this shows a data processing system
comprising a data switch 10 which connects up to sixty data
processing nodes 11, allowing the data processing nodes to
exchange data with each other. Each of the data processing
nodes 11 is connected to the data switch by way of a fibre
optic serial data channel 12.The data switch is controlled by a 50 nanosecond system clock
which is distributed to all the units in the switch.The data switch comprises sixty three port units 13. One of
these port units, referred to herein as the control port, is
connected to a switch control processor 14. Another sixty of
the port units are respectively connected to the fibre optic
data channels 12, so that they can receive data from and send
data to the data processing nodes 11. The remaining two port
units are spare. The data switch deals with two different types of connection
between the ports: static and dynamic. A dynamic connection
can be created or

<CLAIMS>
Data switching apparatus comprising:

(a) a command bus (18),
(b) a plurality of port units (13) connected to the command bus
(18), each port unit including means for sending a connection

command on the command bus specifying source and destination
ports for a required data connection,
(c) a plurality of multiplexing units (15) connected to the
command bus (18), each multiplexing unit being arranged to

respond to a connection command on the bus by preparing a data
connection between the ports specified by that command, and
(d) a connection control unit (16) connected to the command bus
(18), for checking whether the data connection specified by the

connection command is permissible and, if it is permissible,
sending a control signal to all the multiplexing units

instructing them to complete the prepared connection.
Apparatus according to Claim 1 wherein:

(a) the connection control unit (16) is connected to the port
units (13) by means of a connection status bus (111); and
(b) the connection control unit (16) comprises means for placing
a status code on the connection status bus (111) in response to

a connection command, said status code indicating to the port
units the status of the requested connection.
Apparatus according to Claim 2 wherein the connection
control unit (16) includes:


(a) a table for storing the current status of each of said
ports, thereby indicating whether each port is busy or not busy;
(b) means for checking said table to determine the status of the
source and destination ports of each requested connection; and
(c) means for sending a status code on the status bus to
indicate that the required connection is not currently

available, if either the source or destination port is already
busy.
A computer system comprising a plurality of processing
nodes (11) interconnected by switching apparatus (10) in

accordance with any preceding claim.
