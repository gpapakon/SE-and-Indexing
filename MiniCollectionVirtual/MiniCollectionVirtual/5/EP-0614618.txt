<ABSTRACT>
The subject of the invention is an apparatus for washing beet which is made up of an elongate rotary drum with a perforated wall and is fitted on the inside with screw conveyors or blades which carry the beet from one end to the other, and with sprinkler pipes having nozzles which spray water under pressure onto the beet. With a view to using an apparatus of this type for the final washing of beet in the washing station of a sugar refinery, and providing better cleaning of the sugar-containing grooves than is obtained with conventional apparatuses, the drum has on its inside surface low humps (48) and the dimensions of the apparatus and its method of operating are chosen to ensure that the beet (26) is conveyed in a single layer.

Apparatus for washing beetroots constituted by an elongated rotary
drum, the wall of which is perforated and which is internally equipped with

means for ensuring the displacement of the beetroots from one of its ends to
the other, and with means for spraying the beetroots with water under

pressure, characterised in that the drum is constituted by a perforated metallic
shell (34) internally lined with rubber panels (36), likewise perforated, and on

which are formed low protuberances (48).
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in that the said
protuberances are constituted by ribs (48) parallel to the axis of the drum.
Apparatus according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the said
panels (36) are constituted by a metallic frame and a lattice both covered with

rubber.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterised in that the said
panels (36) are fixed to the shell (34) by means of clamping claws (40).
Apparatus according to claim 1, 2, 3 or 4, characterised in that a
space (45) is provided between the shell (34) and the panels (36).
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that it comprises a mechanism for rotating the drum equipped

with a variable speed drive that enables the speed of rotation of the drum to be
adjusted as a function of the flow of beetroots so as to ensure that the

beetroots are displaced in a single layer.
Apparatus according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the drum comprises, at is output end, a beetroot draining

area (30).
