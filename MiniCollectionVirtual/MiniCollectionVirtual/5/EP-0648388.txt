<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a quadrature oscillator. US Patent No. 3350659 discloses an oscillator as recited in the preambular portion of claim 1, comprising first 
and second stages, each stage comprising first and second NOR 
gates. NOR gates with two input transistors between a reference potential and an 
output node, and with a current source connected to the output node are known from 
L.A.GLASSER and D.W.DOBBERPUHL: "The design and analysis 
of VLSI circuits", 1985, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 
Reading, Massachusetts, US: pages 34-37, 228-229. European Patent Application Publication No. 0187572, cited in the 
European search report 
discloses a voltage limiter circuit applied to the output of 
a flip-flop to limit the logical voltage swing and thereby 
increase the speed of the circuit. In particular, European 
Patent Application Publication No. 0187572 aims to reduce the 
switch time (tpd) taken up by the rise (tr) and fall (tf) times. According to the present invention there is provided a quadrature 
oscillator comprising first and second stages, each stage 
comprising first and second NOR gates, wherein: the output of the 
first NOR gate of the first stage is connected as an input to the 
second NOR gate of each of the first and second stages; the 
output of the second NOR gate of the first stage is connected as 
an input to the first NOR gate of each of the first and second 
stages; the output of the first NOR gate of the second stage is 
connected as an input to the first NOR gate of the first stage 
and the second NOR gate of the second stage; the output of the 
second NOR gate of the second stage is connected as an input to 
the second NOR gate of the first stage and the first NOR gate of 
the second stage; characterised in that each NOR gate comprises 
first and second input transistors each having a control node for 
receiving an input signal and a controllable path between an 
output node and a reference voltage, a diode-connected transistor 
connected between the output node and the reference voltage, and 
a current source connected to the output node, said current 
source comprising a third transistor having a control node 
connected to receive a control signal whereby the current source 
is controllable to adjust the rising and falling slew rates of 
signals generated by the oscillator.  
 This oscillator is a non-linear circuit which is inherently 
unstable and which cycles sequentially through four distinct 
states at a rate determined by the constitution of the NOR gates. The
