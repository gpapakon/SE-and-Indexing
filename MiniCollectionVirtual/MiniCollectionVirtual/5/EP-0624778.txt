<ABSTRACT>
In such a position measuring device, a periodic measuring division is scanned by a scanning unit by means of two groups (A, B) of in each case four magnetoresistive elements (An, Bn). To avoid crossovers of the connecting conductor tracks of the magnetoresistive elements (An, Bn) and shortwave interference with the measuring accuracy, the magnetoresistive elements (An) of the first group (A) extend over one division period (t1) of the measuring division with a respective mutual spacing t/4, whilst each magnetoresistive element (Bn) of the second group (B) is arranged in the adjacent division periods (tn) of the measuring division with a respective mutual spacing of 3t/4. Starting from the centre (M1) of both groups (A, B), the nth magnetoresistive element (An) of one group (A) is in each case connected without crossover to the nth magnetoresistive element (Bn) of the other group (B).
