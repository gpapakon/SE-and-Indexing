<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to the field of
nuclear power plant inspection devices. In particular, the
present invention is directed to the field of nuclear power
plant steam generator inspection.Nuclear power plants typically contain three major
components as shown in Figure 1: a reactor which produces
superheated water which is transported to one or more steam
generators; and a power turbine, driven by the steam, which
generates electrical power.The superheated water is transported to the steam
generator by a tube sheet. The tube sheet in a nuclear steam
generator typically forms a pair of tube members or tube rows
separated by a lane, and held together by a plurality of support
plates, separated at periodic intervals. The height of each
tube row may exceed 9.8 m (thirty-two feet), and include six to eight or
more support plates, each separated horizontally at 0.91-1.83 m (three to six
foot) intervals. In the steam generator, the tube sheets
carrying the superheated water are quenched with cool water,
which generates the steam which drives the turbine. The water
exits through a plurality of access ports situated at the bottom
of each lane. This procedure for generating steam presents several
problems. First, the water used to quench the tube sheet is
supplied directly from adjacent rivers or reservoirs. Such
water often has impurities or chemicals which may pierce or
corrode both the steam generator tubes and the support plates.
Periodic inspections of nuclear steam generators are required
for obvious safety reasons connected to their operation, and
steam generator cleanliness has been a problem due to such pipe
corrosion and damage. The highly corrosive environment of the
steam generator is particularly problematic for many of the
older nuclear reactors in service throughout the world.Heretofore, the tubes and support plates of these
steam generators were inaccessible from visual inspection.
Information was gathered by complicated systems which could not
adequately inspect all sections of the tubes and support plates.
Because of the highly radioactive environment and the heat of
the pipes, direct human inspection has typically been restricted
to between three and five minutes per man per six month period.
This time period does not provide an ample opportunity for the
careful inspection for corrosion, holes and leaks. It is
particularly difficult to inspect within the narrow lanes and
the tubes at the support plates, because of the heat,
radioactivity and narrowness of the lanes separating the

<CLAIMS>
A device for inspecting the support plates (26) and
tube sheet of a nuclear steam generator comprising:


a first boom (14) coupled by a rotatable
connector (20) to a second boom, said first and

second boom (14, 16) and said rotatable connector
(20) being insertable into an access port (18) of a

steam generator and into a lane separating two
rows of tube members (24, 24a), said rotatable connector being adapted to upright said second boom

(16) within said lane;
video camera means (30) attached to said second
boom (16) for inspecting the tube members (24) and

support plates (26) within said lane when said second
boom is uprighted; characterised in that said second

boom (16) comprises a plurality of telescoping members
(22).
The device of claim 1 characterised in that
said video camera means (30) is a CCD camer
a.
The device of claim 1 further comprising means
(38) for cleaning said tube members (24) and support plates (26).
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3
characterised in that said tube members (24) are supported by

at least one support plate (26) and said rotatable connector
(20) is adapted to upright said second boom (16) to a

position adjacent to said tube members and said at least
one support plate.
A device according to any one of claims 2 to 4
characterised in that said CCD camera is attached to a

pan and tilt mechanism (32) affixed to said second boom
(16). 
The device of claim 5 further comprising means
for controlling the pan and tilt means.
The device of any one of claims 1 to 6 further
comprising means for extending and retracting said

telescoping members (22).
A method for inspecting the tube sheet of a
steam generator comprising the following steps:


inserting first and second rotatably connected booms
(14, 16) through an access port (18) of said steam

generator and within a lane separating two rows
of tube members (24, 24a), said second boom (16)

having a camera (30) attached thereto; and
uprighting said second boom (16) within said
lane,
separating said rows of tube members (24, 24a), such
that said camera (30) is held adjacent to said tube

members (24) and support plates (26) which can be inspected by
said camera (30) within said lane; characterised

in that said second boom (16) comprises a plurality of
telescoping members (22).
