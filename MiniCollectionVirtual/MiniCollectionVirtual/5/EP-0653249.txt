<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an inserter based 
system that performs automated sorting of mailpieces in 

accordance with predetermined postal discount 
requirements. The system comprises an inserter for 

assembling the mailpieces and a sorter coupled to the 
inserter. The sorter includes a sorter controller and a 

plurality of on-edge sorting bins. The system also 
includes means for communicating mailpiece data and 

configuration data to the sorter controller. The sorter 
controller controls the sorting of mailpieces received 

from the inserter into sort groups according to postal 
discount requirements. A turn-up and alignment device 

and a vertical transport are located between the inserter 
and the sorter. The turn-up and alignment device turns 

the mailpieces from a horizontal alignment out of the 
inserter to a vertical alignment. The vertical transport 

transports the mailpieces on-edge to the sorter. The 
sorter further includes a scanner for scanning codes 

printed on the mailpieces. The sorter controller uses 
data from the scanned codes for sorting the mailpieces to 

designated sort bins.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention disclosed herein relates generally to
inserting systems, and more particularly, to apparatus
for processing the output of inserting equipment. In
particular, the invention relates to an inserter based
system for automated sorting of mailpieces in accordance
with predetermined postal discount requirements,
comprising:
an inserter for assembling the mailpieces;a sorter coupled to said inserter, said sorter
including a plurality of sorting bins;a sorter controller; andmeans for communicating mailpiece data and
configuration data to said sorter controller, said sorter
controller being arranged to control the sorting of
mailpieces received from said inserter into sort groups
according to postal discount requirements. Such an
inserter-based system is disclosed in WO-A-93/18480, with
particular reference to Figures 7 and 9.Reference is also made to DE-B-1234629, which
discloses an apparatus for changing mailpieces from a
horizontal alignment to a vertical alignment. High volume mailers receive discounts in postal
rates for meeting certain criteria established by a
postal service. Generally, such criteria relate to a
reduction in the postal service's handling of the mail
from the mailers. The United States Postal Service
("USPS") offers several levels of discounts to mailers.
The level of discount typically is based on the number of
criteria met by the mailer. For example, in order to
maximize such postage discounts, the USPS requires that
high volume mailers presort the mailpieces, apply a Zip+4
bar code to each mailpiece, and package their mail into
trays with each tray tagged in accordance with the
Domestic Mail Manual. Previously, the sorting and
traying processes required to qualify for postal
discounts have not been performed on an inserter system
because inserters having such capability have not
existed. Large volume mailers have performed the sorting
process on conventional off-line sorting equipment;
however, the traying process has been done manually. Smaller
volume mailers may perform both the sorting and traying
processes manually. In any event, the traying process 
has of necessity been done manually because up to now an
automated traying process did not exist.It is well known to couple conventional stacking
equipment to the end of an inserter. Generally, such
stacking equipment is used to perform a basic stacking of
mailpieces assembled by the inserter.Although off-line sorting with conventional sorting
equipment has worked well, basic problems exist which are
typically associated

<CLAIMS>
An inserter based system for automated sorting of
mailpieces in accordance with predetermined postal

discount requirements, comprising:

an inserter (8) for assembling the mailpieces;
a sorter (110) coupled to said inserter, said sorter
including a plurality of sorting bins (120);
a sorter controller (111); and
means for communicating mailpiece data and
configuration data to said sorter controller, said sorter

controller (111) being arranged to control the sorting of
mailpieces received from said inserter (8) into sort

groups according to postal discount requirements;

characterised in that said sorting bins (120) are
on-edge sorting bins, said sorter controller is included

in said sorter and a scanner (22) in said inserter is
arranged to scan codes printed on the mailpieces, said

mailpiece data communicating means comprising an inserter
controller (12) of said inserter arranged to send data

obtained from said scanned codes to said sorter
controller, said sorter controller being arranged to use

data from said scanned codes for sorting the mailpieces
to designated sort bins.
The system of claim 1 further comprising a turn-up
and alignment device (20) and a vertical transport (30 or

100) located between said inserter and said sorter, said
turn-up and alignment device (20) being arranged to turn

the mailpieces from a horizontal alignment out of said
inserter to a vertical alignment and said vertical 

transport being arranged to transport the mailpieces on-edge
to said sorter (110).
The system of claim 1 or 2 wherein said sorter
further includes a sort tag printer for printing a sort

tag when said sort controller determines that a stack of
mailpieces in one of the stacking bins qualifies for a

postal discount.
The system of claim 1, 2 or 3 wherein said sorter
further includes a scanner (22) for scanning codes

printed on the mailpieces, said sorter controller being
arranged to use data from said scanned codes in the

sorting of the mailpieces to designated sort bins.
