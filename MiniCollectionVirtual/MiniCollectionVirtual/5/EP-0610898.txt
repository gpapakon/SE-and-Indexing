<ABSTRACT>
An overvoltage protection device (20) connected 
between an AC plug (12) and an electronic device (11), 

comprises a first AC pattern (22, 32, 42, 52) having 
first and second concave circular arc sections (22a, 

22b) and a first peak point (22c, 32b, 42c, 52b), a second 
AC pattern having third and fourth concave circular 

arc sections (23a, 23b) and a second peak point (23c), 
and a frame ground pattern (24, 34, 44, 54) having a 

fifth concave circular arc section (24a) with the first 
peak point (22c, 32b, 42c, 52b) as a center and a sixth 

concave circular arc section (24b) with the second peak 
point (23c) as a center, both ends of the fifth concave 

circular arc section (24a) being located at centers of 
the first and second concave circular arc sections (22a, 

22b), and both ends of the sixth concave circular arc 
section (24b) being located at centers of the third and 

fourth concave circular arc sections (23a, 23b). If an 
overvoltage is applied to any of the first and second AC 

patterns (22, 23), a discharge occurs across any of the 
AC pattern (22, 23) and the frame ground pattern (24, 

34, 44, 54), allowing the overvoltage to escape to 
ground. It is thus possible to prevent destruction of 

the electronic device (11) resulting from the application 
of the overvoltage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an overvoltage 
protection device which can prevent an electronic apparatus 
from being destroyed due to an overvoltage, such 
as a surge, caused by lightning, etc. Generally, an electronic apparatus is, when being 
used, supplied with a commercial power supply. In the 
case where lightning strikes a generating station, a 
transmission station, a substation, etc., a very high 
overvoltage (surge voltage) is momentarily applied to a 
power supply line through induction, sometimes causing 
the destruction of some element of the electronic 
apparatus. In the prior art, the electronic device 
has been protected by an arrester from such an 
overvoltage. FIG. 1 is a block diagram showing a conventional 
overvoltage protection device using arresters. Power 
is supplied to an electronic device 1 by inserting an AC 
plug 2 of the electronic device 1 into an AC outlet 3 
provided in a wall, a floor, etc., of a room. The AC 
outlet 3 has AC terminals 3a and 3b connected to commercial 
power supply lines (not shown) and a frame ground 
terminal 3c. The AC plug 2 has AC poles 2a and 2b connected 
to AC terminals 3a and 3b of the AC outlet and a 
frame ground pole 2c connected (grounded) to the frame 
ground terminal 3c of the AC outlet 3 through arresters 
4 and 5.  
 In such a conventional device, when any overvoltage 
occurs on the commercial power supply line and is applied 
to any one of the AC poles 2a and 2b of the AC plug 2, a 
corresponding arrester is operated (turned ON), so that 
short-circuiting occurs between the frame ground electrode 
2c of the AC plug 2 and any corresponding one of 
the AC poles 2a and 2b of the AC plug 2 which is applied 
with the overvoltage. As a result, the overvoltage 
escapes to ground and no overvoltage is supplied to the 
electronic device 1. The arrester has the disadvantage of being normally 
expensive and, further, its operation start voltage cannot 
be set at too high a level. Even if, therefore, any 
overvoltage is applied to the electronic device to a 
practically unaffected extent, a power supply to the 
electronic device is sometimes interrupted. This offers 
the disadvantage of the power supply being frequently 
interrupted to an unnecessary extent. Since, as described above, the arrester is employed 
to protect an electronic device from an overvoltage such 
as a lightning surge, the overvoltage protection device 
involves high costs and, further, an unnecessary power 
supply stoppage has been encountered. The power supply 
stoppage
