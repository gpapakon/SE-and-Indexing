<ABSTRACT>
Each of the mobile stations 12₁ to 12₃ sets delay amounts d₁, d₂ and d₃ at random for every message to be 
transmitted on the basis of the symbol timing received from the base station in order to give delay to the transmission 

signal. The base station (11) inversely diffuses the reception signal to extract the standard symbol timing for each of 
the mobile stations, and allows each demodulator to receive the inverted diffusion output at the extracted timing and 

to demodulate the reception signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) random access communication method and mobile station equipment which enable a plurality of mobile stations and a base station to communicate using the same frequency and the same spreading code and permit random access to the base station from the mobile stations.The service area of a mobile communication system called a cellular system is split into a number of cells, each of which is provided with a base station. Each cell is assigned at least one control channel, in the case of heavy traffic, two or more control channels, and a plurality of communication channels and each mobile station perform communication through the base station of the cell to which the mobile station currently belongs. Each mobile station under contract to receive services is assigned an identification number, and for example, in the case of sending a call originating signal to the base station over the control channel or sending a speech signal to the base station over the communication channel, the mobile station adds its identification number to the information to be sent.The code division multiple access (CDMA) system that has been employed in the past is a communication system which multiplexes signals to be transmitted at the same frequency, by spectrum spreading them with spreading codes which differ with channels. The system configuration and capabilities of the conventional system are described in detail in a reference literature (R.C. Dixon, "Spread Spectrum Communication System," Jatec Shuppan). Now, a brief description will be given of a direct spreading CDMA system.in Fig. 1 there is shown the configuration of a base station transmitting device in a typical CDMA communication system. N information sequences S1, S2, ..., SN are provided to multipliers 411, 412, ..., 41N, wherein they are spectrum spread by multiplying each symbol in each information sequence with a corresponding one of spreading codes C1, C2, ..., CN from a spreading code generator 42 which differ from one another. These spread signals are combined by a combiner 43 at the same timing and the combined output is transmitted by a transmitter 44. At the receiving side, though not shown, the received signals are spectrum-despread by the same spreading codes C1, C2, ..., CN as those used at the transmitting side, by which the N information sequences are extracted individually. In this case, pseudo-random noise codes of the same code length (chip number) (hereinafter referred to as PN
