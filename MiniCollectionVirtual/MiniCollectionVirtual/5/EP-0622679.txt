<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a photographic processing 
method for developing a film (5) having been photographed and 

accommodated in a cartridge (10) and set at a predetermined 
position of a photographic processing apparatus, printing 

the developed film (5) on a photographic paper (6) and developing 
the photographic paper. The method including the steps 

of: (a) providing in advance the film (5) with an ID number 
for identifying the film; (b) reading out the ID number of 

the film (5); and (c) providing the ID number of the film to a 
side of the photographic paper (6) opposite to a side thereof 

on which an image of the film is printed. This method 
enables one to easily specify in which film and in which 

frame of the film an image desired to be extra-printed is 
present.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to photographic 
processing methods. More particularly, it relates to a 
photographic processing method by which one is able to 
easily find in which film and in which frame of the film 
an image of a photographic print to be extra-printed is 
present by merely viewing the reverse side of the print. Conventionally, a developed film is divided into 
some pieces and stored in a film sheet. Users can know 
contents of the film stored in the film sheet by checking 
prints, to which the film is printed, one by one, or by 
holding the film directly to the light. Recently, if a film is subjected to simultaneous 
printing which performs development of a film and printing 
of the developed film at a time, there are some cases 
where each print of the film shows the corresponding frame 
number on the reverse side thereof. However, brightness and hue of the developed 
film is reverse of those of the printed photographic paper 
so that users cannot easily know images of negatives, 
especially for colour photograph. When users wish to make 
extra prints, therefore, it takes much time for them to 
know the specific image and is difficult to distinguish 
the specific image among the other images if images 
similar to the specific image exist in the film. 
Consequently, wrong film numbers might be selected for 
extra prints. Further, where many films are deposited at a 
time for simultaneous printing, even if they are returned 
to the customer together with their photographic prints 
each showing the corresponding frame number on the reverse 
side thereof and sorted for each of the films, enjoying 
the prints by many people or arranging them on an album 
would lead to a difficulty in identifying each print 
with its corresponding film. This results in the 
aforementioned problem that one has to hold the film  
 
directly to the light for collation between the prints and 
the films. Still further, in case that a developed film is 
stored in a film sheet, a problem arises that not only 
time and labor are needed to cut the film into pieces but 
also the operations for extra-printing the film are 
rendered troublesome since the film is divided into some 
pieces. In addition, a film being stored in the film 
sheet is likely to be folded. Furthermore, a used 
cartridge is not reused and hence must be disposed of. In view of the foregoing circumstances, it is an 
object of the present invention to provide a photographic 
processing method by which one is able to easily specify 
in which film and
