A method for reducing the coking of heat-exchange
surfaces in a tubular heat exchanger made of a boiler

steel, which effects rapid cooling of the cracking
products in particular within a plant for the thermal

cracking of hydrocarbons to form alkenes after the
cracking furnace, producing steam,

characterised in that the sides of the heat-exchange
surfaces which come into contact with the cracking

products, once cleaning has been effected, before reuse
of the tubular heat-exchanger, are treated under

reducing conditions until as extensive as possible a
reduction of Fe
2
O
3
 on the surface to Fe
3
O
4
 has taken
place, without submicron Fe powder being formed in so

doing.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that after the cleaning, in particular after cleaning

by means of a hot steam/air mixture, a mixture of hot
steam and hydrogen is passed through the tubular heat-exchanger

on the side which comes into contact with the
cracking products.
A method according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the steam/hydrogen mixture is at a temperature in

the range from 400 to 550Â°C.
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 3,
characterised in that the action of the steam/hydrogen

mixture on the heat-exchange surfaces is maintained for
a period of 1 to 6 hours.
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 4,
characterised in that the content of hydrogen in the 

steam/hydrogen mixture is 5 to 20% by weight, in
particular 5 to 10% by weight.
A method according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that the steam/hydrogen mixture is

passed through the tubular heat-exchanger at a pressure
of 0.5 to 20 bar, in particular of 1.5 to 2.5 bar.
