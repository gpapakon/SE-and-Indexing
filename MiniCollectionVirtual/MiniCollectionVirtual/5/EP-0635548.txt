<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic resin
composition comprising a polyphenylene sulfide resin and a
polyphenylene ether resin, and more particularly to a
thermoplastic resin composition which provides molded
articles with excellent mechanical strength, thermal
rigidity, and appearance and which is useful as engineering
plastics for machine parts, e.g., connectors, ignition
manifolds, gears, bumpers, and coil sealants.Polyphenylene sulfide resin (hereinafter abbreviated
as PPS) is known as a high-melting and heat resistant
crystalline resin with excellent fluidity, organic solvent
resistance, electrical characteristics, and flame retardance.
However, for use as a molding material for such articles as
sliding parts and carriages for optical discs, PPS has poor
stability in extrusion and injection molding due to the low
degree of polymerization reached. Further, since the glass
transition temperature of PPS is about 90Â°C, which is not
very high, PPS molded articles undergo a considerable
reduction in rigidity at high temperatures. Thermal rigidity
of PPS can be improved by compounding with inorganic fillers,
such as glass fiber, carbon fiber, talc, and silica, as
suggested in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,737,539 and 4,009,043. 
However, molded articles obtained from PPS compositions
containing these inorganic fillers tend to suffer from
deterioration of appearance or warpage.In order to prevent warpage and to improve hue, U.S.
Patent No. 5,185,392 proposes a polyarylene sulfide
composition comprising (A) 100 parts by weight of a
polyarylene sulfide, (B) 0.01 to 10 parts by weight of an
organic bisphosphite having the formula:

wherein R1 and R2 each is an alkyl group, an alkyl group
having at least one substituent, an aryl group, an aryl group
having at least one substituent or an alkoxy group, (C) 0 to
400 parts by weight of an inorganic filler, and (D) 0.01 to
5 parts by weight of at least one alkoxysilane selected from
the group consisting of aminoalkoxysilanes, epoxyalkoxysilanes,
mercaptoalkoxysilanes, and vinylalkoxysilanes. The
molded articles obtained from this composition have poor
appearance while having improved flexural strength.On the other hand, a polyphenylene ether resin
(hereinafter abbreviated as PPE) is recognized as an
engineering plastic with heat resistance, dimensional
stability, non-hygroscopicity, and excellent electrical 
characteristics. However, PPE has poor moldability due to
its low melt-flow characteristics and also has insufficient
oil resistance and insufficient impact
