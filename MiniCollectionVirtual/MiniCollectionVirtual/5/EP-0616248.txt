<ABSTRACT>
An image printer includes a projection-exposure 
section for projecting an image born on a film onto a 

photosensitive material, an image-exposure section for 
exposing the photosensitive material based on image 

information comprised of a plurality of image areas 
each including color data relating to a plurality of 

colors, and a transport device for transporting the 
photosensitive material through the projection- 

exposure section and the image-exposure section. The 
image-exposure section includes an exposure device for 

dividing the image information into a plurality of 
lines and exposing the photosensitive material with 

switching exposing colors corresponding to the 
plurality of color data by switching over a plurality 

of color filters, and a moving device for moving the 
exposure device and the photosensitive material 

relative to each other in a direction perpendicular to 
the lines. The image-exposure section further 

includes an exposure control unit for controlling 
operations of the exposure device and the moving 

device. The control unit effects a moving exposure 
control for exposing the photosensitive material by 

switching over the exposing colors while the 
photosensitive material and the exposure means are 

being moved relative to each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
printer, and more particularly to an image printer
including a projection-exposure section for projecting
an image born on a film onto a photosensitive
material, an image exposure section for exposing the
photosensitive material based on image information
comprised of a plurality of image areas each including
color data relating to a plurality of colors, and
transport means for transporting the photosensitive
material through the projection-exposure section and
the image-exposure section.Such image printer as described above may be used
for a variety of purposes. For instance, the printer
allows the projection-exposure section and the image-exposure
section to be utilized independently of each
other. The printer is also usable for a multiple 
exposure operation. In this case, the projection-exposure
section effects an exposure of the film image
onto a certain portion of the photosensitive material
and also the image-projection section effects a
further overlapping exposure of another image onto the
same portion of the photosensitive material while the
photosensitive material is being transported by the
transport means through the projection-exposure
section and the image-exposure section.Conventionally, the image-exposure section of the
above-described image printer effects an exposure of a
video image displayed on a CRT monitor onto the
photosensitive material, the video image being
comprised of a plurality of image areas each including
color data relating to a plurality of colors.According to the above conventional art, however,
the image-exposure section including the CRT monitor
tends to be large and complicated, such that it has
been difficult to form the entire printer apparatus
simple and compact. Thus, there remains room for
improvement in this respect.The document EP-A-0 615 154 (publication date 14/09/94, priority date: 10/03/93) discloses
a method and an apparatus for printing
images wherein when printing images on a photosensitive material, not only ordinary
prints but index prints are automatically printed in the same size as the
ordinary prints for higher work efficiency. The exposure is made for ordinary
prints by the exposure means including a light source, a lens and a shutter. This 
apparatus for printing images comprises a projection exposure means for exposing
a film image to a photosensitive material, a reading means for scanning data
of said projected film image and means for scanning data of said projected film
image and converting them to

<CLAIMS>
An image printer comprising an image exposure section (S) for exposing a
photosensitive material (3) based on image information comprised of a

plurality of image areas each including color data relating to a plurality of
colors;

wherein said image exposure section (S) includes:

a print head (34) for effecting linewise exposure of said image information with respect
to each one of
exposure color components (R; G; B);
moving means (T) for effecting a relative movement between said print
head (34) and said photosensitive material (3); and
exposure control means (E) for controlling said print head (34) and said
moving means (T) so that an image in accordance with the image

information is provided on a predetermined area of said photosensitive
material (3) through a light beam irradiated from said print head (34),
characterized in that

said exposure control means (F) is adapted to selectively provide a stationary exposure
mode for effecting linewise exposure by said print head (34) while said print

head (34) and said photosensitive material (3) are at a standstill, and a
moving exposure mode for effecting the line exposure by said print head

(34) while said print head (34) and said photosensitive material (3) are
moved relative to each other.
An image printer as defined in Claim 1, characterized in that said exposure
control means (E) reverses a direction of said relative movement between

said print head (34) and said photosensitive material (3) each time the
switchover of sa
id exposure color componenets (R; G; B) is effected. 
An image printer as defined in Claim 1, characterized in that said exposure
control means (E) returns said print head (34) and said photosensitive

material (3) to respective home positions each time the switchover of said
exposure color components (R; G; B) is effected, and that said plural times

of line exposure scanning operations are effected in one direction of said
relative movement between said print head (34) and said photosensitive

material (3).
An image printer as defined in any of the preceeding claims, characterized
in that said one of exposure color components (R; G; B) is selected by

controlling a rotary member (33) having a red color filter (33a), a green
color filter (33b) and a blue color filter (33c) arranged side by side along a

periphery of said rotary member (33).
An image printer as defined in any of claims 1 through 3, characterized in
that said one of exposure color components (R; G; B) is selected by

controlling sliding of a filter mount (110) having a red color filter (110a), a
green color filter (110b) and a blue color filter (110c) disposed side by side

along a sliding direction of said filter mount (110).
An image printer as defined in claims 4 or 5, characterized in that an
optical fiber (122) guides light from a light source to said print head (34)

through a filter for said one of exposure color components (R; G; B).
An image printer as defined in any of the preceding claims, characterized in
that said image printer further includes: a projection-exposure section (P)

for projecting and exposing an image born on a film onto said photosensitive
material (3); and transport means (H) for transporting said photosensitive

material (3) through both said projection-exposure section (P) and said
image exposure section (S) so that exposure is adapted to be effected onto

said photosensitive material (3) by both said projection-exposure section (P)
