<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a photomultiplier in which a 
transmittance of an incident light and a photosensitivity 

is high and a hysteresis characteristic is excellent. 
Therefore, in the present invention, a photocathode 16, 

dynodes 17a to 17c and an anode 18 are supported between 
insulating material substrates 12a and 12b provided in a 

glass bulb 11. A transparent conductive film 19 is formed 
on an inside wall surface of a light entrance portion 15. 

The transparent conductive film 19 electrically contacts 
with a pad 20 which is led through a terminal 14 to the 

outside. The same potential as the photocathode 12 is 
applied through the pad 20 to the transparent conductive 

film 19. The incident light directly impinges on the 

photocathode 16 through the glass bulb 11 and the 
transparent conductive film 19 at a place corresponding to 

the light entrance portion 15. As a result, the incident 
light reaches the photocathode 12 with not being interfered 

at all, and the transmittance of the incident light is 
improved. Since a predetermined potential is applied to the 

transparent conductive film 19, the change of the potential 
of the inside wall surface of the glass bulb 11 is performed 

at high speed, and the hysteresis becomes extremely small.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a side-on type photomultiplier. Fig. 1 is a side view, partly in vertical section, of a 
conventional side-on type photomultiplier which is 
generally used, and Fig.. 2 is a cross-sectional view of the 
photomultiplier. In this photomultiplier, light to be 
measured enters through a side of a glass bulb 1 which is a 
transparent closed container. The incident light passing 
through the glass bulb 1 impinges on a photosurface of a 
reflection type photocathode 2, whereby photoelectrons are 
emitted from the photosurface. The photoelectrons are then 
delivered to an electron multiplying unit constituted of 
plural stages of dynodes 3a, 3b, 3c ···. The electron multiplying 
unit successively multiplies the photoelectrons, and 
the multiplied electrons are collected as an output signal 
in an anode 4. A grid electrode 6 is provided between a light entrance 
portion 5 of the glass bulb 1 and the photocathode 2 so as 
to guide the photoelectrons emitted from the photocathode 
2 to dynode 3a of the first stage. The potential of the grid  
 
electrode 6 is set to be equal to that of the photocathode 
2. There are various types of grid electrodes which may be 
employed as the grid electrode 6. For example, the grid 
electrode 6 may be a grid electrode (not shown) constituted 
in a manner that fine conductive wires are placed in a grid-shaped 
configuration, or a grid electrode constituted in a 
manner that one fine conductive wire 6c is helically wound 
around two supporting rods 6a and 6b as shown in Fig. 1. There is also known a side-on type photomultiplier 
disclosed in JP-B-53-18864. As shown in Fig. 3, in this 
side-on type photomultiplier, a glass plate 7 on which a 
transparent conductive film is formed is employed instead 
of the grid electrode 6. There is also known a side-on type photomultiplier 
disclosed in JP-A-4-292843. JP-A-4-292843 discloses a 
structure in which a conductive portion such as an aluminum-evaporated 
film is formed on an inside wall surface of a 
glass bulb except for a light entrance portion. Further, 
JP-A-4-292843 also discloses that the conductive portion is 
formed also on the light entrance portion when the 
conductive portion is transparent. The conductive portion 
reduces a resistance of the inside wall surface of the glass 
bulb, so that a time constant formed by stray capacitance 
and the surface resistance of the inside wall surface of the 
glass bulb is small. Since the time constant is small, the 
unstableness of the potential on the inside
