<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a class of surface-active 
siloxane compounds useful as surface coatings or useful for modifying 
surface coatings, such as, water repellent treatment or coatings on 
concrete, as additives in paints for metallic surfaces, and as 
hydrophobizing agents for inorganic fillers, and a method for preparing 
such surface-active siloxane compounds. There is an ongoing need to provide surface-active 
siloxane compounds for use in surface coatings to impart properties 
such as water repellency, spreadability, low friction coefficient, reduced 
brittleness, and high gloss to a variety of surfaces such as wood, metal, 
and concrete. There has correspondingly been a need to control these 
properties at a molecular level so that undesirable effects, such as 
excessive surface migration, poor paintablility, and areas of high 
localized cross-link density do not adversely affect a surface coating in 
its properties such as consistency, performance, or esthetic surface 
appearance. Surprisingly, the present invention provides a class of 
siloxanes, each having a single reactive alkoxysilane moiety, which 
siloxanes are reactive to moisture and compositions having hydroxyl-functionality, 
including polymers of various kinds and inorganic 
substrates, such as silica fillers, and which siloxanes are stable and 
have long term storage capabilities.  The present invention provides a class of siloxane 
compounds having the general Formulae I (linear) or II (cyclic):
