A method for receiving teletext data being contained in a 
television signal and being repeated within one or more cycles, in 

which 

the teletext data are separated from the television signal, 
data related to each one teletext page are collected, and 
the teletext pages being combined to magazins of each 100 pages 
are intermediately stored, 
 
and in which 


at least one Basis TOP Table being transmitted within a magazin 
in form of a special teletext page is evaluated to determine which 

teletext pages are actually present, whereby in accordance with 
the evaluation of the Basis TOP Table a selected teletext page is 

only searched for if its presence is indicated by the Basis TOP 
Table, 
characterised in that
 
in case of parallel transmission of two or more magazins each in 

form of a separate cycle within the same television signal and in 
case of a transmission of one, two or more Basis TOP Table(s), each 

of them being correlated to a magazin or to a group of magazins, 
an additional list is evaluated which is contained within one Basis 

TOP Table and which indicates in coded form 

(a) the number and indexing of the provided maximum number of 
magazins, 
(b) the relationship(s) of the Basis TOP Table to the correlating 
magazins, and 
(c) the number(s) of the magazin(s) where the related Basis TOP 
Table(s) is (are) transmitted, 
  
 

wherein the evaluation of the additional list is performed to 
determine 


how many and which magazins can be actually received, and 
whether the receivable magazins are combined with and, if any, 
with which other receivable magazins in a joint Basis TOP Table. 
A method in accordance with claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
list further indicates to which magazines no Basis TOP Table is 

related. 
A method in accordance with claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 
the list further indicates which magazins of the provided maximum 

number of magazins are not transmitted.
