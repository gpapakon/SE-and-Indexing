second aspect comprises a heat-resistant airtight 
container (111) for raw sewage, and an induction heating 

device (119) disposed under the container (111). The

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a raw sewage 
disposal apparatus. The raw sewage discharged from humans 
is typically discharged into a sewage system by a flush 
toilet or the like and then flows into a river after 
purification in a holding tank. However, at events such as 
festivals, athletic events, fairs, meetings and the like, 
temporary toilet facilities must be provided for disposal 
of raw human waste. Employed conventionally are movable temporary 
toilets, most of which have a tank for temporarily storing 
the raw sewage therein. However, temporary toilets require 
the raw sewage contained in the tank be sucked into a 
vacuum truck, and the collected raw sewage must then be 
transferred to a sewage purifying facility. This is 
laborious and time consuming and is unhygienic. Transportation vehicles such as trains and 
buses, which operate over long distance, are provided with 
a tank exclusively for storing the discharged raw sewage. 
The raw sewage in this tank is subjected to a chemical 
deodorizing treatment and is thereafter collected by a 
vacuum truck at a terminal or collection point. The storing, collecting and disposal methods are 
thus not modern and are very unhygienic. If the temporary 
toilet has been used for a long period of time, the raw 
sewage in the tank causes a bad smell, and operators 
dislike disposing of the raw sewage.  
 In an attempt to ameliorate the above problems, 
there have been proposed several hygienic disposal methods. 
In one method, chemicals are introduced into the raw sewage 
storage tank to prevent the generation of the bad smell and 
to effect sterilization of the sewage. This method, 
however, cannot be used for a long period of time because 
the chemicals become diluted, and costs are high, though 
this method is often employed in transportation vehicles. In another method, the raw sewage is contained 
in a bag made of vinyl or the like to prevent the diffusion 
of the bad smell. This method, however, requires a vinyl 
bag of large size and involves a high cost for disposal 
thereof, and it is troublesome to separate the raw sewage 
from the bag. A large-scale disposal facility is also 
required. In still another method, the discharged raw 
sewage is directly dried by use of heat from a burner, etc. 
Since the primary component of raw sewage is liquid, a 
large amount of heat energy is required to remove the 
liquid and it takes a long period of time to effect 
disposal of the raw sewage. In view of the drawbacks of the above 
conventional methods, the
