<ABSTRACT>
The non-recursive half-band filter processes a complex-valued input signal with reduced sampling rate to form a complex-valued output signal. The filter contains only one individual half-band filter arrangement into which the real and imaginary part are supplied with a temporal offset. The number of delay elements is doubled for sequentially admitting and intermediately storing the alternate real and imaginary part.
