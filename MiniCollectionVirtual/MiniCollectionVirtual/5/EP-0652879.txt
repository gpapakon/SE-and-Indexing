<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical
agents (compounds) which act as 5-HT4 agonists or
antagonists and/or 5-HT3 antagonists in mammals. As 5-HT4
agonists, these compounds are gastrointestinal
prokinetic agents useful for the treatment of human
gastrointestinal (GI) hypomotility disorders such as
reflux esophagitis, gastroparesis, nonulcer dyspepsia,
ileus, constipation and irritable bowel syndrome
(constipation predominant). As 5-HT4 antagonists these
compounds are useful in the treatment of motility
disorders of the GI tract such as diarrhea and
irritable bowel syndrome (diarrhea predominant). As 5-HT3
antagonists these compounds are useful in slowing
colonic transport and therefore are useful in the
treatment of diarrhea predominant irritable bowel
syndrome. The 5-HT4 agonists or antagonists and/or 5-HT3
antagonists are also useful in the treatment of
emesis, anxiety, visceral pain, substance abuse (either
cravings or withdrawal syndrome), cognitive disorders
and other CNS disorders wherein treatment with a
serotonin 5-HT4 agonists or antagonists and/or 5-HT3
antagonists would be indicated.Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) functions as
a neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous
system (CNS) and in the periphery. Serotonin is
unsurpassed among monoamine neurotransmitters in the
number of receptor subtypes identified. To date, the
number of subtypes is into the teens, including the
major subtypes 5-HT1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 2A, 2B, 3
(perhaps subtypes), 1P, serotonin transporter, etc.
Because of the multiplicity of serotonin receptor
subtypes, the identification of which serotonin 
receptor subtype is correlated to various
physiological/pharmacological actions is complicated.Serotonin has been known for some years to promote
peristalsis in the GI tract in various animal models.
During the mid 1980s, several specific antagonists to
the 5-HT3 receptor subtype were identified from
independent laboratories. These 5-HT3 antagonists were
shown to be prokinetic in various rodent models.
Hence, many publications and patents have issued
wherein 5-HT3 antagonists are claimed to be useful as
GI prokinetic agents to treat various human
hypomotility states: reflux esophagitis, nonulcer
dyspepsia, gastroparesis, ileus, irritable bowel
syndrome.Gunning and Naylor (J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1985, 37,
78) reported that metoclopramide (a 5-HT3 antagonist
which blocks the 5-HT3-mediated Bezold Jarisch reflex)
enhanced electrical-field stimulated contractions in
guinea pig stomach strips. Simultaneously,
