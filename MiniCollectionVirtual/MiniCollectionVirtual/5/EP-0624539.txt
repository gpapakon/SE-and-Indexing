<ABSTRACT>
A rotatable reel apparatus (10) for use in association 
with an axle (100) and the like, for operably winding, storing, 

transporting and unwinding various windable materials. 
A core member (12), having an inner peripheral surface (23) 

and an interior region (24), is operably sandwiched between 
a first (14) and second (16) corrugated paper platform member. 

The platform members (14,16) include a spindle region (18,18'), a 
plurality 

of core attachment flaps (31-34,36-39) and a plurality of spaced 
apart apertures (41-45). Each of the apertures (41-45) include distal 

edges (61-64) and proximal edges (56-59) wherein each of the proximal 
edges (56-59) are operably positioned adjacent the peripheral 

surface (23) of the core member (12), and each of the distal edges 
(61-64) collectively serve to define the outer periphery of the 

spindle region (18). The core attachment flaps (31-34,36-39) operably 
depend from each of the proximal edges (56-59) of the spaced 

apart apertures (41-45) and are folded inwardly toward, and into 
operable secured contact with, a corresponding portion 

of either the inner or outer peripheral surface of the 
core member. A concentrically positioned circular slot (50,50') 

is integrally formed within the spindle region of each 
of the platform members (14,16) to facilitate operable and 

aligned cooperation with, and rotation about the axle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reels, and, more 
particularly, to a rotatable reel apparatus for use in 
association with an axle and the like, for operably 
winding, storing, transporting and unwinding various 
windable materials. Reels used in cooperation with an axle and the like 
have been known in the art for many, many years. Typically, 
such prior art reels have been constructed from 
relatively rigid material, such as plastic, wood and/or 
steel, wherein the platforms of the reel are either 
molded with, nailed or welded to the core portion of 
which the windable material is actually wound around. 
Although such prior art reels have been adequate from a 
functional standpoint, their deficiencies have resulted 
from their relatively heavy weight, expensive cost 
associated with their manufacture and replacement, and, 
in many cases, with respect to the potential pollutants 
which occur during their manufacture, as well as their 
potentially poor recyclable characteristics after such 
reels have been discarded. Furthermore, although such prior art reels have 
been constructed with a core member sandwiched between a 
first and second platform, few, if any, of such prior 
art devices utilize platforms constructed from corrugated 
paper material which provides adequate structural 
integrity at a relatively low cost, and which, in addition 
to light weight, is environmentally desirable due 
to the recyclable nature of the material from which it 
is constructed. Additionally, although such prior art  
 
has disclosed attachment of the platforms to the top and 
bottom edges of the core member, few, if any, of such 
prior art devices teach, much less disclose, the use of a 
corrugated paper platform having integrally attached core 
attachment flaps which are inwardly folded from the 
platform from which they depend, toward, and into, 
operable contact with either the inner or outer 
peripheral surfaces of the core member to, in turn, 
provide operable securement of the platforms to the core 
member. In the specification of United States patent number 
3,093,343, which was published on June 11 1963, there was 
proposed a paperboard reel, which it was said could 
readily be disassembled and assembled, and which would 
include multi-ply end discs, and a core consisting of at 
least three plies, the radially innermost of the plies 
having two sets of a given number of tabs, one set being 
integral with and folded laterally inwardly from the 
laterally innermost ply of one end disc and the other set 
being
