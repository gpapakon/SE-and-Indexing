<ABSTRACT>
Cold-drinks dispensers for providing refreshing drinks impregnated with carbon dioxide are usually connected to the public water mains; in hygienically sensitive regions, such as, for example, hospitals, they require special measures for ensuring a low count of pathogenic bacteria contained in the refreshing drink. For this purpose, provision is made for sinking a dispensing orifice (61) for such a refreshing drink in the extraction shaft (62) of the cold-drinks dispenser and for lining it in such a way that it cannot be touched by the fingers of a user of the cold-drinks dispenser and is protected against dirt settling on it, for providing a water filter (22) which guarantees a specific sterilization of the fresh water (21), through which minerals dissolved in the fresh water (21) can pass, for a sampling of the unfiltered and filtered fresh water (21) to be possible and, alternatively, for a disinfecting fluid to be capable of being fed into the water circuit; the cold-drinks dispenser comprises an ice-cube preparer (7), into which filtered fresh water (21) can be fed and the ice cubes (21c) of which can be conveyed into the extraction shaft, the associated conveying orifice being provided with an automatic closure (78), counter to the closing force of which the ice cubes (21c) can be conveyed.
