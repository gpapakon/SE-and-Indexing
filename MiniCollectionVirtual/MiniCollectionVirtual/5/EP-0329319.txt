<ABSTRACT>
A highly efficient process is disclosed for the 
production of substantially amorphous ethylene-propylene 

copolymers which are useful as hot melt adhesives, as 
blending components in roofing materials, and as cable and 

wire flooding agents. The process involves reacting from 
70 to 96.5 wt. % propylene and from 3.5 to 30 wt. % 

ethylene at a temperature between 55°C (130°F) and 80°C 
(175°F) and at a reactor pressure sufficient to maintain 

propylene in the liquid phase, in the presence of from 0.7 
to 3.0 mol % hydrogen based on the monomer feed to the 

process and employing as catalyst a composition comprising: 

(a) a solid catalyst component obtainable by 

(i) co-comminuting magnesium halide support 
base and aluminium trihalide in a molar ratio from 8:0.5 to 

8:3 in the absence of added electron donor and 
(ii) then co-comminuting the product of step (i) 
in the absence of added electron donor with sufficient 

titanium tetrahalide to provide a molar ratio of magnesium 
halide to titanium tetrahalide from 8:0.4 to 8:1 and 
(b) a co-catalyst component comprising a mixture 
of from 15 to 100 mol % of trialkyaluminium having from 1 

to 9 carbon atoms in each alkyl group and 85 to 0 mole % of 
an alkylaluminium halide having at least one halide group 

 
 

per molecule and from 1 to 9 carbon atoms in the alkyl 
group in a sufficient quantity to provide an Al/Ti ratio in 

the range from 50:1 to 600:1; 
 
and recovering a substantially amorphous, random 

ethylene-propylene copolymer having a tacticity index m/r 
in the range of from 2.5 to 4 as determined by ¹³C NMR 

spectra.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing substantially amorphous ethylene-propylene 
copolymers having an ethylene content of not more than 15% by weight. In the manufacture of propylene homopolymers and 
copolymers, conventional polymerisation techniques using 
unsupported catalysts result in the simultaneous production 
of substantial quantities of atactic polymer in addition to 
the desired product of high crystallinity and isotacticity. 
Various methods have been employed for the purification and 
separation of these two polymers. The by-product, i.e., 
the atactic polymer of low crystallinity is being utilized 
commercially as a component in various adhesive 
compositions, roofing materials, caulking compounds etc. Recently, developments have been made of new 
catalysts which are highly active and more stereospecific 
than the aforementioned conventional catalysts. The 
proportions of atactic polymer in the polymers produced 
employing these catalysts are substantially reduced and 
therefore the polymer product generally does not require 
any purification for removal of the atactic or low 
crystalline polymer. Because of the rapid adoption in 
existing polymer production facilities of these new 
catalysts, there has been generated a serious shortage of  
 
low-crystalline, atactic polymers. U.S. Patent No. 3,789,036 to Longi et al. 
discloses a process for the production of 
ethylene-propylene elastomers containing between about 20 
and 70 wt. % ethylene using a magnesium-supported titanium 
catalyst, e.g., a co-ground mixture of titanium 
tetrachloride and magnesium chloride. It has been found 
that this catalyst is not very active and, therefore, the 
polymer produced in the process contains undesirably large 
quantities of catalyst residues. Secondly, the polymer is 
more crystalline than desired as measured by the m/r ratio 
described in detail hereinafter. Finally, because of the 
low catalyst activity, the catalyst costs become 
prohibitive. EP-A-0251771 describes the production of amorphous 
ethylene-propylene random copolymers using a magnesium 
halide catalyst support base and an aluminium trihalide 
and titanium tetrahalide catalyst with a mixed trialkylaluminium/alkylaluminium 
halide co-catalyst. This 
catalyst system permits formation of products having a 
m/r ratio below 4. However it is unable to provide 
products meeting the requirements for softening point, 
open time, needle penetration and/or heat of fusion when 
the ethylene content is very low.  
 It is
