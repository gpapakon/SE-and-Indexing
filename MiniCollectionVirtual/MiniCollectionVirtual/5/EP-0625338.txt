<ABSTRACT>
A dental handpiece contains a sleeve (13) for 
rotatably accommodating and securing a dental treatment tool 

(9) therein bearings (15, 15') for rotatably holding the 
sleeve (13) with respect to stationary handpiece casing 

members (11, 17), a rotatable rotor (14, 14') fixed to the 
sleeve (13) for rotating the sleeve under action of a 

compressed fluid, and stationary convexed and concave 
protective members (18, 18') for sheathing the bearings (15, 

15') exposed to an annular spacing (23) defined by the 
bearings (15, 15') and the rotatable rotor (14, 14'). The 

rotatable rotor (14, 14') contains rotatable concave and 
convexed disc portions (20, 20'). The rotatable concave and 

convexed disc portions (20, 20') are arranged in proximity to 
the stationary convexed and concave protective members (18, 

18') in a mating relation therewith for defining therebetween 
at least a first gap (19, 19') and a second gap (21, 21') 

communicating with the first gap and disposed radially 
outwardly of the first gap (19, 19').

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dental handpiece and,
more particularly, to a dental handpiece having a bearing
protective member capable of preventing bearing oil shortage
and terminating the suction of tooth debris into the inside of
the bearing.A dental handpiece as defined in the preamble of claim 1 is
generally known.Up to now, a dental handpiece having a dental tool
mounted thereon has been used extensively for tooth treatment.
The conventional dental handpiece of the angle type is shown
as an example in Fig.5.A angle type dental handpiece 50 has its foremost
part constituted by a head housing 51 for loading a dental
treatment tool 9 therein and a head housing jacket 52
connected to the head housing 51.Within the head housing 51 at the foremost part of
the dental handpiece is removably mounted a casing 57 made up
of a cartridge casing 57a and a casing lid 57b. Within the
casing 57 are arranged a bur sleeve 53 for receiving the
dental treatment tool 9 via a reception opening 53a for
securing the tool in position, a rotor 54 for rotationally
driving the bur sleeve 53, an upper bearing 55 and a lower
bearing 55' for rotatably supporting the bur sleeve 53 with
respect to the head housing 51. A head cap 56 is threadedly
mounted on the top of the head housing 51. Within the head 
cap 56 is mounted a chuck device, not shown, for removably
holding the dental treatment tool 9 on thrusting or releasing
a pushbutton 56a. Within the head housing jacket 52, there
are an air supply passage 52a for supplying compressed air to
the rotor 54 and an air discharge passage 52b for discharging
the compressed air supplied into the inside of the head
housing 51.Radially outwardly of the bur sleeve 53 is mounted
the rotor 54 in a spacing 58 between the upper bearing 55 and
the lower bearing 55'. The rotor 54 acts as an air turbine
rotated with the bur sleeve 53 by the compressed air supplied
from the air supply passage 52a.The above-described dental handpiece 50 has,
however, a drawback that compressed air supplied via the air
supply passage 52a for rotationally driving the rotor 54 is
discharged to the outside of the head housing 51 via small
gaps around the bearings 55, 55' exposed to the spacing 58, so
that oil shortage tends to be produced in the regions of balls
55a, 55a' and retainers 55b, 55b'. Thus, it becomes necessary
to replenish oil such as by oil spraying for lubricating or
washing the bearings 55, 55' suffering from oil shortage.
Although grease may be used in order to combat the problem of
oil shortage,

<CLAIMS>
A dental handpiece comprising:

sleeve means (13) for rotatably accommodating and
securing a dental treatment tool (9) therein,
bearing means (15, 15') for rotatably holding the
sleeve means (13) with respect to stationary handpiece casing

members (11, 17),
rotatable rotor means (14, 14') fixed to said sleeve
means (13) for rotating said sleeve means under action of a

compressed fluid, characterised by

   stationary convexed and concave protective members
(18, 18') for sheathing said bearing means (15, 15') exposed

to an annular spacing (23) defined by said bearing means (15,
15') and said rotatable rotor means (14, 14'),

   said rotatable rotor means (14, 14') comprising
rotatable concave and convexed disc portions (20, 20'), said

rotatable concave and convexed disc portions (20, 20') being
arranged in proximity to said stationary convexed and concave

protective members (18, 18') in a mating relation therewith
for defining therebetween at least a first, axially extending gap (19, 19') and a

second, axially extending gap (21, 21') communicating with said first gap and
disposed radially outwardly of said first gap (19, 19').
The dental handpiece as claimed in claim 1 wherein
said rotor means (14) comprises a main rotor body and said

rotatable concave and convexed disc portions (20, 20')
separate from and secured to said main rotor body. 
The dental handpiece as claimed in claim 1 wherein
said rotor means (14') comprises a main rotor body and said

rotatable concave and convexed disc portions (20, 20') formed
integral with said main rotor body.
