<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a mast assembly, having a telescopic mast (M) consisting of a plurality of telescopic tubes (R1, R2) which can be pushed into one another and of an antenna supporting tube (S) on which the payload is arranged and which is connected to the telescopic mast (M). In this case, the antenna supporting tube (S) is connected to the first (topmost) telescopic tube (R1) via a first rotation point (G1). In addition, there is a lever (H) which connects a second rotation point (G2) to a third rotation point (G3), the second rotation point (G2) being permanently connected to the second telescopic tube (R2), and the third rotation point (G3) being permanently connected to the antenna supporting tube (S).
