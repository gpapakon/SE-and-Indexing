<ABSTRACT>
A method of controlling gate oxide thickness in the 
fabrication of semiconductor devices wherein a sacrificial 

gate oxide layer is formed on a semiconductor substrate 
surface. Nitrogens ions are implanted into select locations 

of the substrate through the sacrificial gate oxide layer, 
and the substrate and the gate oxide layer are then 

thermally annealed. The sacrificial gate oxide layer is 
then removed and a gate oxide layer is then formed on the 

substrate layer wherein the portion of the gate oxide layer 

formed on the nitrogen ion implanted portion of the 
substrate is thinner than the portion of the gate oxide 

layer formed on the non-nitrogen ion implanted portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the
manufacture of semiconductor devices, and more particularly,
to methods of controlling gate oxide thickness in the
fabrication of semiconductor devices.Semiconductor chips typically have gate oxide layers of
a single thickness. However, it is sometimes preferable to
have gate oxide layers of varying thicknesses on a single
chip. For example, input-output drivers normally are
subjected to a higher supply of voltage entering externally
to the chip. The use of thicker gate oxides would prevent
these devices from having unacceptably short time dependent
dielectric breakdown (TDDB) characteristics, and also reduce
the possibility of needing to add circuitry to the chip to
avoid early TDDB failure. Current methods require a complicated procedure in
order to produce a semiconductor chip having varying gate
thicknesses. First, a gate oxide layer is grown on the
semiconductor chip surface. A portion of this gate oxide
layer must then be masked. The mask can be used either to
slow the growth of the gate oxide layer on the masked
portion of the chip surface or to isolate the masked area
while the unmasked portion of the gate oxide layer is
further reduced.Two major problems are associated with the use of this
masking technique to produce different gate oxide
thicknesses on a single chip. First, the use of the mask
can cause contamination problems in the gate oxide layer.
Any impurities in the gate oxide layer may affect the
performance of the gate oxide layer and consequently the
performance of the entire chip. Second, the use of a
masking technique requires additional process steps which
are costly and time-consuming. Accordingly, there is a need
for a process of controlling gate oxide thickness in the
fabrication of semiconductor devices which overcomes the
above-mentioned deficiencies.The control of gate oxide layers using selective
nitrogen implantation is known from EP-A-0 366 423 and JP-A-58 054 638.The present invention provides a method of controlling
gate oxide thickness in the fabrication of semiconductor
devices according to claim 1. The invention in its broad form resides in a
method of controlling gate oxide thickness in the
fabrication of semiconductor devices, as recited in claim 1.
More particularly, the method involves forming a sacrificial
gate oxide layer on select locations of a silicon
semiconductor substrate surface, known as the gate oxide
area. Nitrogen ions are then implanted into select
locations of the gate oxide area through the gate
sacrifi
