<ABSTRACT>
A reagent housing for use with sampling systems comprises a hollow 
compartment, 2.2, which has an inlet port, 2.3, and an outlet port, 2.4, 

a plurality of reagent containers, 2.1, sized and shaped to fit within 
the compartment, 2.2, the containers, 2.1, comprising receptacle means 

and have a releasable lid, 2.7, the containers, 2.1, being able to be 
opened so that reagents can be placed therein, the containers being 

provided with aperture means, 2.8, so that fluid flowing through the 
hollow compartment, 2.2, can dissolve the reagents contained within the 

containers, 2.1. The reagent containers, 2.1, can be adapted so that 
they can take the reagents either in pellet form or in powdered form. 

Ideally, the hollow compartment, 2.2, is tubular in shape, the inlet 
port, 2.3, and outlet port, 2.4, being located in ends of the tube. A 

suitable shape for the cross section of the hollow compartment, 2.2, is 
that of a circle. The reagent containers, 2.1, are located linearly 

within the hollow compartment, 2.2, each being able to contain a 
different pre-selected reagent. The reagent containers, 2.1, can 

further comprise a sintered disk located behind the aperture means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the packaging or presentation of a reagent in a
sensor system and, particularly, but not exclusively, a flow-through
sensor system.The determination of substances, additives or contaminants within a
sample solution frequently requires conditioning the solution prior to
the taking of any readings. The term reagent mentioned above is
therefore meant to include ligand, salts and other species which affect
the characteristics of a given sample. For example, it is known that
where the presence of a metal ion is to be detected, the addition of a
ligand which binds specifically with the ion to be detected, can
increase the sensitivity of a sensor system by at least one order of
magnitude. In addition, the use of the salt trisodium phosphate may be
used as a reagent to buffer aqueous solutions to values of pH in excess
of pH10. Thus the use of these and other reagents may be desirable in a
sensor system.One sensor system based upon well-known and well-established
voltammetric techniques, Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (ASV), employs the
use of such reagents. Hitherto, ASV has involved discrete sampling
techniques. To analyse a sample solution, a single pre-determined
volume of that sample solution is taken, pre-determined amounts of
appropriate reagents are then added to provide a solution of known
specification and a measurement is then taken. The disadvantage of this 
system is that it requires an operator to periodically, and often
frequently, visit sites to collect samples before taking readings. This
can be a costly and time consuming procedure, especially when the sites
are in remote and/or hostile environments. However, the inventor has
developed a flow-through ASV system whereby sampling can take place
either continuously or at pre-determined intervals so as to determine at
given instances in time the composition of a sample solution. This new
technique is highly advantageous in that in enables operators to view
dynamically the constituents of a sample and so observe variations in
readings over a given time. Further, the system can be installed in a
pre-determined location and, under suitable programming, left to perform
a number pre-programmed operations.However, there are significant difficulties associated with this
flow-through system in that reagents may have to be continually added to
the sample solution if recordings are to be taken. It follows therefore
that for each given reagent the function of the system is limited to the
dissolution properties of each reagent.In
