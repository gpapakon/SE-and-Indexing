<ABSTRACT>
Flexographic press structure and operation which 
includes a plurality of decks (12) each removably supporting a plate 

roll (15) and an anilox roll (14) with each roll including a sleeve 
(24;51) rotatably mounted on a stationary mandrel (23;58) and 

supported at the 
ends thereof, the press is equipped with a lifter (37-40) at one end to 

free each roll from its support at the other end whereby the 
sleeve can be removed over the other end.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a deck for, and a method of operating
a flexographic press, as set out in the pre-characterizing
part of claims 1 and 8 below. When changing to the next print job on a flexographic
printing press, the plate rolls and often the anilox (inking)
rolls need to be replaced. This is because the new plates
replace those previously mounted on the plate rolls and, in many
cases, the ink cell volume on the anilox roll needs to be
adjusted for the new print job.Traditionally, flexographic presses support the inking
roller (anilox roller) and plate roller on bearings which open
to release the rolls for job change. Once open, the rolls are
lifted out of the press using a chain hoist or custom designed
robot.The market for just-in-time print jobs has continued to
increase the demand for shorter change times on presses.
Likewise, the average job size is rapidly decreasing. This has
spawned a new class of press which is narrower than the typical
wide-web ¾ to 1½ metres wide (30 to 65 inch wide), long run press. The new press is
also intended to be quickly changed from one job to the next by
only one person.One solution to fast roll change which is possible on
medium width presses  2 / 5 to ¾ metre wide (16 to 30 inch wide) is to use plate
sleeves instead of plate rolls (i.e., plate sleeves fit over a
mandrel whereas plate rolls have bearing journals). Because of
the narrower width, these sleeves can be of a weight which can
be lifted by hand ½ to 1 Kg (10 to 25 lb.). Two types of sleeves have
been used. The first style is the "simply" supported plate
roller.In this style, the plate roll consists of a sleeve
which is locked onto a mandrel. During printing the roll is 
rotatably supported in bearings at each side of the press. For
sleeve removal, the mandrel is cantilever supported from one
side while the opposing bearing is dropped away from the
mandrel. This is analogous to unchucking a mandrel in a center
winder such as that seen in co-owned patent No. 2,769,600. The
plate sleeve is then released from the mandrel and slid sideways
to remove it from the press.The problem with this arrangement is that the deck
designs to allow the bearing and support to drop away (giving
clearance for removal) are bulky, complex and costly. The
problem is aggravated by the operator requirements to connect
register control actuators to the roll.The second style is the "cantilever" supported plate
roller. Recently, a press has been developed which only
supports the plate and anilox mandrels from one side of the
pr

<CLAIMS>
A deck for a flexographic press comprising a deck
frame (12) adapted to be mounted on the press (10) for movement

relative to a central impression cylinder (11), a plate roll (15)
and an anilox roll (14) each rotatably mounted on said deck frame

characterized by each of said rolls having an axially-extending
stationary mandrel (23, 58) and a sleeve assembly (24, 51)

rotatably mounted on said mandrel and concentric thereto, gearing
means (32, 34) mounted on each of said sleeve assemblies for

rotating said sleeve assemblies, saddle means (43, 45) on said
frame for supporting each mandrel adjacent each mandrel end, and

lift means (37-40) on said frame adjacent one end of each mandrel
for cantilever raising each mandrel while freeing the mandrel other

end from the saddle means (43) whereby the associated sleeve
assembly can be removed for replacement.
The deck of claim 1 in which said other end saddle
means (43) is equipped with closure means (54-60).
The deck of claim 1 in which each sleeve assembly is
equipped with position hub means (31, 52), said frame including a

hub holder (46, 53) removably receiving said hub means.
The deck of claim 1 in which said lift means includes
a pressure fluid cylinder and piston roll unit (40, 61) fixedly

carrying bracket means (37), said mandrel being rigidly coupled to
said bracket means. 
The deck of claim 1 in which said frame includes a
pair of side wings (12a, 12b), a saddle (43, 45) mounted on each of

said side wings, the saddle (43) ont he other (12a) of said side
wings being equipped with closure means (54, 55) to cooperate with

said lift means in maintaining said mandrel fixed in place during
press operation.
The deck of claim 1 in which each sleeve assembly
includes inner and outer sleeves (28, 25) and end plate means (26,

27) coupling said inner and outer sleeves.
The deck of claim 6 in which said inner sleeve
includes bearing means (29, 30) outboard of said end plate means,

said mandrel being received in said bearing means.
A method of operating a flexographic press comprising
the steps of


providing a press frame having a plurality of deck frames
(12) each removably supporting a plate roll (15) and an anilox roll

(14), each roll including a sleeve assembly (24, 51) rotatably
mounted on a stationary mandrel (23) and supported at the ends

thereof characterized by
providing lift means(37-40) on each deck frame adjacent
one end of each mandrel for cantilever raising each mandrel while

freeing the mandrel other end from the support,
elevating (61, 40) one of said rolls to free it from
support at one end,
removing the sleeve from the mandrel over said one end,
and
replacing the first mentioned sleeve with another sleeve.
The method of claim 8 in which said steps include
providing a deck frame and providing gearing on said sleeve inward

of said frame.
The method of claim 8 in which said steps include
replacing the sleeves of both of said rolls.
