<ABSTRACT>
A clock supply system for electronic devices that require 
various operating clock signals of different frequencies, for 

instance a computer, uses a single quartz oscillator (1, 204) 
to generate a low-frequency (e.g. 32.768 kHz) base clock 

signal which is supplied to plural PLL circuits (11 - 16) 
that generate the required operating clock signals fed to 

various units (5 - 10) of the electronic device (4). The PLL 
circuits are independent from but preferably arranged near to 

the units they supply. The quartz oscillator is part of a 
real-tim
e clock module (2) or a clock generator module.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clock supply system for electronic devices, e.g. computers, that 
require a variety of operating clock signals of different frequencies. Fig. 8 shows one type of a conventional clock supply system for a computer. The computer shown 
in Fig. 8 comprises several units like a CPU unit 102, an FDD (floppy disk drive)/HDD (hard disk 
drive) unit 103, a bus control unit 104, a VGA (video graphics array) unit, a keyboard unit and 
others. A plurality of quartz oscillators 101 are provided, i.e. each unit has at least one quartz 
oscillator for its own to receive the required operating clock signal or signals. In this prior art, each 
quartz oscillator includes a CMOS-type IC chip and a quartz resonator. This imposes considerable 
cost and size limitations on products using this system. Further, at least some of the individual 
quartz oscillators have to generate high frequency operating clock signals. They require AT-cut 
quartz resonators which are expensive, especially in the high frequency range from 40 MHz to 80 
MHz. Fig. 9 shows another type of a conventional clock supply system used in a computer. Except for the 
clock supply system, the computer shown in Fig. 9 has the same structure as that of Fig. 8 and the 
same reference numerals are used to denote the same units. In the clock supply system of Fig. 9 a 
multi-output clock generator 105 is used to generate the various operating clock signals required for 
the individual units of the computer. Clock generator 105 comprises a quartz oscillator having a 
quartz resonator 106, and several PLL (phase locked loop) circuits each of which provides one of 
the required operating clock signals of different frequencies. The clock generator 105 supplies the 
individual operating clock signals to the respective units of the computer. Clock supply systems of 
this scheme have become widespread. In this clock supply system, however, clock lines are necessary 
to supply the operating clock signals from the common clock generator 105 to the individual 
units and at least some of these lines may extend over a substantial distance. Because of the high 
frequencies of the operating clock signals transmitted via these clock lines, EMI (electromagnetic 
interference) noise is generated which propagates over the whole circuit board forming the 
computer system and possibly even to the outside of the computer. This noise causes phase-shifted 
clocks and impulse clocks to enter the phase comparators of the PLL circuits included in the
