<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to crosslinkable aqueous coating dispersions
in which the basis of the crosslinkability is provided by the reaction in an
applied coating between epoxy groups and certain polymer-bound
epoxy-reactive groups, and to coating processes using such dispersions.Polymeric film coatings are well established in the technology of
protection of surfaces, and are frequently required to become cross-linked
for certain applications. Thermal curing (often referred to as stoving) is
widely used, especially in the case of melamine-formaldehyde cured coating
systems. However, such systems suffer the disadvantage of release of
formaldehyde on curing. They also require a high stoving temperature
(typically about 150°C) which can be somewhat reduced by use of strong acid
catalysts but at the expense of impairment of the coating performance. Such
disadvantages are overcome by the present invention.Epoxy-cured aqueous coating systems in which epoxy groups and epoxy-reactive
groups are present in separate particles of an aqueous dispersion
are known from PCT Application No. W091/14715 and US Patent No. 4,367,298.
However, these are expensive to produce and present difficulties in the
maintenance of storage stability.When high temperature applications are envisaged for coating
dispersions, as for example in the coating of heated substrates, a
relatively high minimum film forming temperature (MFT) for the
dispersion can be tolerated, provided that such MFT is the same as, or
less than, the temperature of the substrate. This is quite a common
situation for stoving applications on metallic substrates. However, in
low temperature applications, for example room temperature, it is
necessary to depress the MFT of the coating composition, for example by
the addition of a co-solvent (acting as a coalescing solvent). However,
care is required in the choice of such MFT depressants. A cosolvent
Which partitions strongly in the polymer phase of the aqueous polymer
dispersion can itself depress the glass transition temperature (Tg) of
the polymer in the dispersed particles and which therefore, in certain
instances (notably when the depressed polymer glass transition temperature 
is lower than the storage temperature to which the dispersion is exposed),
may lead to premature cross-linking in the polymer system.We have discovered that certain water-soluble or water-dispersible
polymers are particularly effective in depressing the MFT of crosslinkable
compositions without significantly affecting the storage stability
