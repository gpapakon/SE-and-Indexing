<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus is indicated for continuous communication between a path and vehicles (FZ) moving on it. Control commands and status messages are exchanged between the vehicles and an area control centre (Z1, Z2) via a leaky cable (LKA1, LKA2) laid along the path. The feeding into/out of the leaky cable is performed at feed-in/feed-out points disposed at predefined intervals by radio transceivers (FSE1...FSE4) which all transmit at the same radio frequency and are connected via a modulation line (FB1, FB2) to the area control centre. The leaky cable sections in each case between two feed-in/feed-out points are fed from both ends using time division multiplexing. For this purpose, the transceivers are divided into groups which transmit at different times. Consecutive transceivers in this case belong to different groups. Signals from on-board transceivers (S/E) at a different radio frequency are received via the leaky cable and forwarded via the modulation line to the area control centre.

System for continuous information exchange between a
track and vehicles running thereon and equipped with radio

transceivers and on-board controllers, comprising a leaky
cable which is laid along the track, is divided into

sections, and has feed-in/feed-out points at predetermined
intervals at which trackside radio transceivers connected

by a data line to an area control centre feed transmitted
signals of a first radio frequency intended for the

vehicles into the leaky cable and feed incoming signals of
a second radio frequency received from the vehicles and

intended for the area control centre out of the leaky
cable, characterized in that each of the leaky-cable

sections (LKA1, LKA2) is disposed between two feed-in/feed-out
points and is fed alternately from both sides, in that,

to this end, the trackside transceivers (FSE1...FSE3) are
divided into at least two groups which transmit in

different, successive time intervals and the transceivers,
disposed along the track at successive feed-in/feed-out

points, belong alternately to one group or the other, and
in that, at each feed-in/feed-out point, the same

transmitted signal is in each case fed into both leaky-cable
sections meeting there.
System according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
feeding of transmitted signals into the leaky-cable

sections and the feeding of the received signals out of the
leaky-cable sections at the respective feed-in/feed-out

points takes place via a common hybrid (H).
System according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that a time frame (ZR) with a number of time slots (ZS) is

provided for the trackside radio transceivers, in that the
groups of transceivers occupy the individual time slots for

transmission in cyclic succession, and receive signals
transmitted by the vehicles (FZ) in time slots not occupied 

for transmission, in that the time slots occupied by the
individual groups of transceivers for transmission are

assigned cyclically and sequentially to the individual
vehicles reported in the area, and are occupied by control

information intended for the respective vehicles, and in
that the duration of the time slots is known to the on-board

controllers (BSG) of the vehicles, and each vehicle,
starting from the beginning or end of a time slot assigned

to it, defines a time slot in which it transmits, via its
transceiver (S/E), signals intended for the area control

centre (Z1, Z2).
System according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
time interval (VZ) between the end of a time slot assigned

to a vehicle and the beginning of a time slot defined by
the on-board controller of said vehicle for the

transmission of signals intended for the area control
centre is adapted to the time required to process the

control information received by the vehicle.
