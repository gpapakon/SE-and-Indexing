<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the glueing of paper and/or plastic or mixed products, especially sealing flaps for envelopes, paper bags and the like, with a contact adhesive, and for the application of a protective strip which covers the contact adhesive until it is used. The core of the invention lies in a) using a material web having non-stick properties as starting material and b) first applying a non-stick means to the material web, c) then applying the contact adhesive onto the non-stick means or onto the material web, d) cutting the material web, after the application of contact adhesive, into individual strip-shaped elements serving as protective strips and e) finally placing the protective strip having the contact adhesive, serving simultaneously as contact adhesive carrier, directly onto the paper and/or mixed product, respectively, or onto a web-shaped material, product or intermediate product.

A method of glueing products (2) of paper and/or plastics, in
particular closure flaps for envelopes, paper bags and the like, with a

contact adhesive (4), and applying a protective strip which covers the
contact adhesive until use, in which a web of material (15) with anti-adhesion

properties or a web of material (15) which is initially coated with
an anti-adhesion agent is advanced, then the contact adhesive (4) is applied

to the web of material (15) or the anti-adhesion agent and the web of
material (15) with the contact adhesive (4) is cut through to form

individual strips (3) which serve as protective strips and which by being
applied directly with the contact adhesive (4) to the advanced products (2)

or a product web (2b) adhere thereto, characterised in that prior to being
applied to the products (2) or the product web (2b) the strips (3) are cut

off the web of material (15) along their longitudinal edge extending
transversely with respect to the longitudinal extent of the web of material

(15), that the cut-off strips (3) are advanced in their transverse direction
and that during said advance movement the strips (3) are applied to the

product web (2b) or products which are advanced in the same direction.
A method according to claim 1 characterised in that a silicone
paper web is used as the web of material (15) with the anti-adhesion

coating.
A method according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the
contact adhesive (4) is applied to the web of material (15) over the surface

thereof and in the form of spaced surface portions.
A method according to one of claims 1 to 3 characterised in that
the contact adhesive (4) is applied to the web of material (15) at a spacing

from at least one edge (43). 
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to one of claims 1
to 4 comprising a conveyor arrangement (8 to 13) for the web of material

(15), having guide, pulling and direction-changing rollers, an applicator
arrangement (5 to 7, 40a) for applying the contact adhesive (4) to the

advanced web of material (15), a cutting apparatus (16) for severing the web
of material (15) transversely with respect to its direction of travel, a

transport arrangement (26) for advancing the products (2) or the product web
(2b) and a feed apparatus (21) with which the contact adhesive (4) applied

to the web of material (15) is brought into contact with the advanced
products (2) or the product web (2b), characterised in that the cutting

apparatus (16) is arranged upstream of the contact location (24) in the
direction of travel of the web of material (15), that the cutting apparatus

(16) is provided for severing the web of material (15) with small cutting
spacings corresponding to the width of the strips (3) and that the feed

apparatus (21) is designed for further transportation of the cut-off strips
(3) in the direction of the width thereof until they are applied to the

products (2) or the product web (2b).
Apparatus according to claim 5 characterised in that the cutting
apparatus (16) is at the same time in the form of a feed apparatus (21).
Apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6 characterised in that the
applicator apparatus (5 to 7) for applying the contact adhesive (4) to the

web of material (15) has a trough (5) for the contact adhesive (4), an
applicator roller (6) which dips into the trough (5) or the contact adhesive

(4) and a doctor device (7) associated with the applicator roller (6).
Apparatus according to claim 7 characterised in that the web of
material (15) which is drawn off a roll (20) is guided firstly downwardly

and then under the trough (5) for the contact adhesive (4) and then on the
side thereof and there upwardly again and then is guided on to the 

applicator roller (6) to and away therefrom and finally to the cutting
apparatus (16).
Apparatus according to one of claim 5 to 8 characterised in that in
the region of the applicator arrangement (5 to 7) the web of material (15)

is guided around a pressure roller (10) which can be pivoted away and which
is mounted on a lever arm (17) and which serves at the same time as a

pulling roller.
Apparatus according to one of claims 7 to 9 characterised in that
the applicator roller (6) has surfaces (31) arranged in a strip

configuration with recesses (32) arranged in a grid configuration in the
manner of an intaglio printing cylinder.
Apparatus according to claim 5 or claim 6 characterised in that
the applicator arrangement is in the form of an intermittently operating

nozzle (40a) for applying the contact adhesive (4) to the web of material
(15a).
