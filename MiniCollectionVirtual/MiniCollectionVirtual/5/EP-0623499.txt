<ABSTRACT>
A method for clear track signalling is disclosed in which axle count pulses which are acquired at counting points of a route area which comprises several sections of track are fed to a computer and stored thereby for each counting point in a direction-related fashion, in which method clear track signalling occurs for a track section if the same counter state is stored for the counting points which bound the track section and in which method correction of a counter state is performed when the counter states stored for the next two counting points in the direction of travel are the same and higher than the counter state to be corrected or when the counter states which are stored for the two directly succeeding counting points in the direction of travel are the same and lower than the counter state to be corrected. The correction takes place by approximating the counter state to be corrected and the counter states of the respectively significant adjacent counting points.

A method of indicating a track section in a railway 
installation as unoccupied, wherein the number and 

direction of movement of passing axles are determined as a 
count of axle-counting points arranged in the track, 

wherein by comparing the counts determined at axle-counting 
points following each other in the direction of running, 

the unoccupied condition of the track section located 
between said axle-counting points is determined if the 

comparison indicates agreement, and wherein to correct 
counting errors, use is made of a computer to which the 

counts obtained at all counting points of a track area 
comprising two or more track sections are fed, wherein for 

each counting point along the route of a train, count 
pulses provided by said counting point are counted by the 

computer relative to the direction of running and stored as 
a count, characterised in that, to correct counting errors, 

an erroneous count is only adapted to the counts of two 
counting points if the latter are the counting points 

following in the direction of running and their counts are 
equal and higher than the count to be adapted, or if said 

two counting points are the immediately preceding counting 
points in the direction of running and their counts are 

equal and lower than the count to be adapted. 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the route travelled by a train is recorded in the computer, 

and that to this end, for each counting point influenced by 
the train, the count determined by said counting point is 

stored and is deleted as soon as the respective axle-counting 
point following in the direction of running has 

determined an equal count, and that counting points for 
which a count was stored and then deleted remain marked and 

mark the route travelled by the train in the computer.
