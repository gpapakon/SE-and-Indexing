<ABSTRACT>
A. A radio card capable of being associated with a computer 
and comprising a PLL device and a digital control apparatus, 

both being directly driven by said computer. It further 
comprises an FM tuner controlled by the PLL, at the output of 

which there are provided an RDS recording device and a decoder 
of the stereo/mono signal, which latter in turn is connected 

to said digital control apparatus. This latter is connected to 
an amplifier comprising two stereo channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a radio card which is 
capable of being associated with a computer. Computers are presently used in several fields where 
they accomplish various calculation and control functions in 
systems and processes. Further to being employed as 
calculating means, computers are being integrated into 
telecommunication technologies, thus becoming capable of 
placing telephone calls, transmitting data or telefaxsimile, 
receiving radio and television signals, linking themselves 
with multimedial and interactive data bases anywhere in the 
world. Several so called interactive "personal media" have 
become widely spread, such as home videophone, radio receivers 
incorporated in a personal computer, interactive compact 
discs, and others from which new technical solution and 
therefore new products are generated. The main object of the present invention, is to allow 
the direct control of the tuning and decoding operations 
concerning standard RDS (Radio Data system) signals and the 
direct control of the audio functions in a personal computer, 
contrarily to what takes place in the known devices. In order to accomplish the above object, the present 
invention consists of a radio card capable of being associated  
 
with a computer, characterized in that it comprises a PLL 
device and a digital control apparatus, both being directly 
driven by said computer, an FM tuner controlled by said PLL, 
at the output of said tuner there being provided an RDS 
recording device and a decoder of the stereo/mono signal, said 
decoder being connected to said digital control apparatus 
which in turn is further connected to an amplifier comprising 
two stereo channels. The construction and the functions, as well as the 
advantages of a radio card in accordance with the present 
invention will be better understood from the following 
detailed exemplary but not-limiting description, with 
reference to the accompanying drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a block diagram of a first embodiment of a 
radio card capable of being associated with a computer; Figure 2 is a block diagram of a second embodiment of a 
radio card according to the present invention. The access to the various functions of the card is 
accomplished by means of memory addresses through which the 
Input/Output functions can be programmed with a suitable 
communication protocol. With reference to Figure 1, there is schematically 
illustrated a first embodiment of the present invention. The 
illustrated embodiment consists of an internal radio
