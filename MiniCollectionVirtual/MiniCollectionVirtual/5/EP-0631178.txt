<ABSTRACT>
A coating composition for a conductive layer is detailed. The novel 
composition provides for excellent coating quality without the necessity 

for surfactants. Also advantageous is the absence of salts which may be 
detrimental to subsequent coats. These advantages are provided in a 

coating composition for forming a conductive layer on a substrate 
comprising; a conductive crosslinkable polymer; a volatile amine; a 

crosslinking means.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antistatic coating composition and to 
materials comprising antistatic coating compositions. More specifically 
this invention relates to improved antistatic compositions which can be 
coated with a minimal salt content and with minimal added surfactant. Permanent antistatic coating compositions are well known in the 
art. For example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,225,665; 4,701,403 and 4,859,570; 
disclose particularly useful antistatic layers for photosensitive elements. 
Auxiliary layers for use with antistatic coatings are described in U.S. Pat. 
Nos. 4,585,730; 4,940,555; 4,891,308 and 5,128,233. The essential elements of a suitable antistatic coating include 
an electrically conductive polymer having integral groups which can be 
crosslinked; a crosslinking, or hardening compound; and an optional, yet 
preferred plasticizer. Widely used conductive polymers are those with a sulfonate, or 
sulfonic acid as the charge carrying group and a carboxyl as the group to 
be crosslinked. These polymers have shown great utility as an antistatic 
coating yet several problems still exist in practice. The polymer is typically available in the acid, or low pH form, or in 
the basic, or high pH form. In the basic form the carboxyl groups and 
sulfonate groups are predominantly ionic with a counter ion such as 
sodium or potassium. Due to the ionic charge these materials act as a 
surfactant in water and lower the surface energy. Several problems 
occur with basic, or ionic antistatic polymers. The predominant problem with the basic, or high pH, form of the 
conductive polymer is the propensity to grow organisms. This problem is 
particularly bothersome when the solid conductive polymer must be 
stored for long periods of time.  Another problem with the basic form of the conductive polymer 
occurs when subsequent coats are added over the antistatic layer. It is 
well known in the art that the surface energy of a coating solution must 
be lower than the surface energy of the surface being coated. Therefore, 
a substrate with a high surface energy and a solution with a low surface 
energy is most desirable. Ionic antistatic polymers act as a surfactant, or 
soap, in solution which is highly desirable for coating. The problem 
occurs when subsequent coats are applied supra to the ionic antistatic 
polymer layer. The low surface energy is never lost and therefore any 
subsequent coating must be applied over a low energy surface which is 
undesirable. If other layers are to be coated supra to the
