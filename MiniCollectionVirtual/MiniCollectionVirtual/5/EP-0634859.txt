<ABSTRACT>
A portable telephone set (2b, 2c, 3b, 4b, 4c) is 
provided with a remote control button for remotely controlling 

the base station telephone set (3a) by operating 
the button. If the portable telephone set (2b, 2c, 

3b, 4b, 4c) is out of the service area of the base station 
set (3a) when the remote control button is 

operated, the portable telephone set (2b, 2c, 3b, 4b, 
4c) calls the base station set (3a) by using the telephone 

numbers of the base station set (3a) stored in the 
RAM (37; 41, 57) of the portable telephone set (2b, 2c, 

3b, 4b, 4c) to connect it (2b, 2c, 3b, 4b, 4c) to the 
base station set (3a) by way of a line and thereafter 

transmits a remote control signal for the operated 
remote control button to the base station set (3a). If 

the portable telephone set (2b, 2c, 3b, 4b, 4c) receives 
control information from a radio base station as it 

enters the service area of the radio base station from 
outside the service area, the speaker (24; 54) of the 

portable telephone set (2b, 2c, 3b, 4b, 4c) sounds to 
notify the user of the situation. If the destination 

telephone set (2a, 3a, 4a, 2b, 2c, 3b, 4b, 4c) does not 
respond to a call of the portable telephone set (2b, 2c, 

3b, 4b, 4c), using the transceiver function with which 
it is provided, it automatically calls the destination 

telephone set (2a, 3a, 4a, 2b, 2c, 3b, 4b, 4c) with the 
telephone number.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable
telephone set and a portable telecommunication
apparatus to be suitably used for a second generation
cordless telephone system and, more particularly, it
relates to a telephone set and a portable telecommunication
apparatus having a function of automatically
determining if it is in or out of the service area.
Such a telephone set is known from US-A-5 127 042With the rapid development of digital technologies
in recent years, mobile telecommunication systems using
digital communication scheme are becoming more and more
popular instead of those using analog communication
scheme. The mobile telecommunication system necessarily
involves exchange of control signals between radio base
stations connected to a telecommunication network and
portable telecommunication apparatuses belonging to the
system. A basic system for realizing high efficient and
high quality radio communications can be constructed by
using digitized control signals. With the application
of digital technologies to the mobile telecommunication
system, both the radio base station and the portable
telecommunication apparatuses can be downsized so that
the portable telecommunication apparatuses may provide
an enhanced level of portability.Thus, the number of subscribers of portable
telephone sets which is a kind of the portable
communication apparatus utilizing digital technologies 
are remarkably increasing. The digital communication
system is free from the problems that conventional
analog communication systems are hard to meet the
increasing number of subscribers for mobile telecommunication
systems because of restricted frequency allocation
and has a deficiency of limited confidentiality.
Recently, a second generation cordless telephone system
utilizing widely such digital technologies has been
intensively developed.In the second generation cordless telephone system,
a vast number of channels is created by limiting the
effective area of each single portable telephone set to
a small zone called micro cell and allocating repeatedly
a single frequency band to different subscribers through
the time division multiplex so that the limited number
of frequency resources available for telecommunications
can be effectively exploited. Since each zone (or cell)
is made small, only a low output is required for the
portable telephone set so that it may consume power at a
reduced rate and can be constructed to be compact.
Hence the telephone set can operate for a prolonged
period and it can use a small size
