<ABSTRACT>
A multicycle refastenable tape closure system (10) is disclosed. The tape closure system comprises a fastener tape component (12) having double-coated surfaces of pressure sensitive adhesive and preferably also a release tape component (14) having opposing surfaces of pressure sensitive adhesive and a low adhesion release layer. The fastener tape component and the release tape component are capable of firmly adhering to opposing body coverings or along opposing edges of one body covering and capable of releasably adhering to each other to provide a multicycle refastenable contact of opposing body coverings or closure of the body covering opposing seams in an overlapping, low profile manner. A method of using a multicycle refastenable tape closure system is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to multi-cycle refastenable 
pressure-sensitive adhesive tape closure systems, methods of use, 
and articles incorporating such tape closure systems thereon. Coverings have been used to protect and otherwise 
serve mammalian bodies for centuries. Body coverings have been 
constructed with portions thereof requiring closure. A myriad of 
fastening devices have been employed to permit opening and closing 
of body coverings. Among these include drawstrings, snaps, 
hook-and-loop fastening systems, pins, buttons, and the like. 
Ease and multiple cycling of various refastenable systems varies 
according to integrity of seams surrounding such closures, 
integrity of a fastening means, and manual dexterity required for 
fastening and unfastening through multiple cycles. For example, 
use of buttons or drawstrings on a hospital gown for a human 
patient requires considerable manual dexterity with often 
unacceptable and uncomfortable results. Body coverings are integral or multi-component 
materials and can include without limitation garments, medical 
drapes, medical gowns, medical smocks, footwear coverings, ostomy 
appliances, incontinence products, diapers, feminine hygiene 
products, industrial clean room garments, and other components, 
(such as splints or arm boards), capable of being joined together 
or with other components to function in close proximity with at 
least a portion of a mammalian body. In recent years, disposable body coverings have become 
increasingly popular. Among disposable body coverings enjoying 
considerable popularity are children's disposable diapers. 
Refastenable pressure sensitive adhesive tape closure systems have 
become common in use with children's disposable diapers where back 
and front sections of a diaper are closed in a refastenable 
manner. Single-coated pressure sensitive adhesive tape tabs on 
the back portion of the diaper are releasably fastened to a 
release strip resident on the back portion of the diaper using the 
single-coated adhesive surface. These tabs are unpeeled and 
applied in a releasable fashion using the single-coated adhesive 
surface to a release surface on the front portion of the diaper.  
 
The same single coating of pressure sensitive adhesive both 
releases from the back portion of the diaper and adheres to the 
front portion of the diaper. Such tabs strategically placed on 
the front portion of the diaper create a snug-fitting diaper where 
portions of the back of the diaper overlap portions of the front 
of the

<CLAIMS>
A multi-cycle refastenable tape closure system (10), 
comprising a fastener tape component,
 
   said fastener tape component (12) comprising 


(a) a first field (26) of pressure sensitive adhesive 
coated on a first surface (22) of a first backing (20), and 
(b) a second field (28) of pressure sensitive adhesive 
coated on a second surface of said first backing or coated on a 

second backing adhesively laminated to said second surface of said 
first backing, wherein surface area of said first pressure 

sensitive adhesive field is larger than surface area of said 
second pressure sensitive adhesive field, wherein the system is 

characterized by 
 
   said first field and said second field being acrylate 

pressure sensitive adhesives comprising the same or similar 
pressure sensitive adhesive formulations having the same or 

similar tack per unit area;
 
   said first field of pressure sensitive adhesive 

capable of firmly adhering along a first edge (16) of a body 
covering and second pressure sensitive adhesive field capable of 

releasably adhering to a second body covering or along a second 
edge (18) of the body covering opposing the first edge of the 

first body covering in a multi-cycle, refastenable manner to 
contact opposing body coverings or to close the opposing first and 

second edges of the body covering to form an overlapping, low 
profile seam which has a high dynamic shear force against 

unintended reopening but a low peel force for intended reopening 
in the axis of the seam; and
 
   wherein the tape closure system remains functional after 

exposure up to at least 50 kGys of gamma radiation. 
The tape closure system (10) according to Claim 1, 
wherein the system is further characterized by a release tape 

component (14) comprising a backing (30) having first and second 
opposing surfaces, said first surface of said release tape 

component covered with a low adhesion release layer (38), said 
second surface of said release tape component coated with a third 

field (36) of acrylate pressure sensitive adhesive,
 
   said third pressure sensitive adhesive field capable 

of firmly adhering to the second body covering or along the second 
edge of the first body covering opposing the first edge of the 

body covering, and said second pressure sensitive adhesive field 
capable of adhering to said low adhesion release layer in a multi-cycle, 

refastenable manner to contact opposing body coverings or 
to close the opposing edges of the body covering to form an  

 
overlapping, low profile seam. 
The tape closure system (10) according to Claim 2, 
wherein said first pressure sensitive adhesive field (26) has a 

higher peel force from the body covering than a peel force of said 
second pressure sensitive adhesive field (28) from said low 

adhesion release layer (38), and wherein the tape closure system 
(10) has a higher dynamic shear strength than the body covering to 

which the tape closure system is adhered. 
The tape closure system (10) according to Claim 2, 
wherein said second pressure sensitive adhesive field (28) peel 

force from said low adhesion release layer (38) ranges after 
initial fastening from about 9 to about 280 Newtons/meter, and

covering comprises a natural or synthetic material having at least 

one edge (16) capable of forming a seam.
