<ABSTRACT>
A system for the sorting of parcels as they move on a conveyor in a sorting 
establishment of a Post Office or of a parcel delivery company. The system 

is capable of locating the label on the parcel bearing data of the adressee, 
and establish its dimensions. The coordinates of the label are determined by 

a low magnification camera, and scanning cameras are used for a sharp line 
scan of the data on the label, means being provided for desplaying the data 

and for ultimately sorting the parcels according to the said data. 
There is also provided a method for sorting parcels moving on a conveyor 
belt by acquiring the data on the relevant label and using the data for the 

sorting of the parcels according to their destination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system and method for automatic 
detection and high resolution display of parcel labels 
scanned from a moving conveyor belt. It is primarily 
suited for automatic parcel sorting in depots. The system, 
working at high speed, automatically detects the relevant 
parcel label, by means of a two stage inspection technique, 
from a large scope of label colors, contrasts, sizes and 
positions. In addition, the system automatically measures 
the length, width, and height of the parcel. The system of 
the invention can be interfaced to a commercially available 
optical character recognition (OCR) system and/or bar code 
decoders (when the parcel has a bar code label). This 
parcel information can be transmitted to the sorting 
machine or to the depot database for follow up. The system can deliver the high resolution image of the 
label to an operator for manual keying of the parcel label 
as remote video encoding (RVE) that will increase the speed 
and reliability of the sorting process. Depot parcel sorting is generally done manually by the 
depot employees. By automating the process, one can reduce 
the number of employees in the depot as well as increase 
speed and reliability. In the late 80's, optical character recognition systems 
were introduced to read the zip code on evelopes in major 
post office facilities.  The problem of reading the label on parcels has not been 
satisfactorily solved due to the fact that the parcel size 
can vary in a relatively large range, and the label 
position can be arbitrary, therefore, there is a problem 
imaging labels with a high resolution of up to 400 DPI that 
is required for OCR. Moreover, the label color and 
contrast is in a wide range. The invention relates to a system and to a method for the 
location of a relevant label on a package while this is 
moving on a conveyor. The invention further relates to a 
system and method for determining the dimensions of such a 
parcel. The main feature of the novel system and method is 
the ability to determine the location of the relevant label 
(which bears the address of the receiver of the parcel) and 
to focus on same so that its image can be projected to a 
desired location. In the presence of more than one label 
on the upper surface of the parcel, the system either 
recognizes which of these is the relevant one, or if this 
is not within the capability of the system, it projects the 
images of the labels which may be relevant to the desired 
location, where these images can be scanned and

<CLAIMS>
A system for locating a relevant label bearing data 
of the addressee on a parcel and for its high resolution 

display, while said parcel moves on a conveyor belt, and 
for optionally determining the dimensions of such parcel, 

which comprises the stages of: 

a. determining the coordinates of the outline of the 
parcel and the outline of the relevant label by means of a 

low magnification camera and determining the height of the 
parcel by a suitable sensor; 
b. actuating one or more high resolution scanning cameras 
according to the determination of the label location and 

speed of movement on the conveyor so as to provide a sharp 
line scan of said label, and displaying the image thereof 

at any desired location. 
A system according to claim 1, where the surface of 
the moving conveyor band is scanned by means of a scanning 

mirror, picture acquisition of the relevant label being 
actuated when required according to the determination of 

label position on the moving parcel. 
A system according to claim 1 or 2, where the height 
of the parcel is determined by means of an ultrasonic 

sensor. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 3, which 
comprises a CCD camera for label coordinate detection, an 

acoustic sensor for height determination and a high 
resolution camera enabling a high resolution line scan 

imaging the area of the relevant label. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
comprising means for acquiring at a short time interval two 

images of the parcel moving in a linear motion on the 
conveyor, means for obtaining a subtration image of said 

images, and means for deducing from said subtraction image 
the outer edges of the parcel and the location and size of 

the relevant label, and means for providing a high 
resolution image of said label. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 5, 
interfaced with a OCR system. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 6, 
comprising means for reading a bar code, if present on the 

parcel. 
A system according to any of claims 1 to 7, provided 
with means for remote video encoding. 
A system for the determination of the location of a 
relevant label on a parcel moving on a conveyor, for 

determining parcel dimensions and for forming a sharp image 
of such l
abel at a desired location, substantially as 
hereinbefore described and with reference to the Figures. 
A method for locating a relevant label at the upper 
surface of a parcel moving on a conveyor and for optionally 

determining the dimensions of the parcel which comprises 
determining the level of the said upper surface above the 

level of the conveyor, focusing a camera on the surface of 
the parcel, acquiring at the correct moment the image of 

the said relevant label and scanning the label, resulting 
in a high resolution image of the label, and evaluating the 

data on said label. 
A method according to claim 10, which comprises 
scanning the surface of the parcel by a moving mirror, and 

projecting the image of the label at the correct instant to 
suitable display means.
