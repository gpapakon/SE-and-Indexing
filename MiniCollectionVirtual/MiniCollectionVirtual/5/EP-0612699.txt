<ABSTRACT>
A mold cooling apparatus comprising a pair of complementary 
mold arms (10), each arm supporting mold halves (13) such 

that when the arms are moved toward one another the molds 
halves form plural cavities (C). Each mold arm (10) 

supports a first air chamber (15) to which air under 
pressure is supplied and a second air chamber (16) 

communicating with the first chamber and having an opening 
(28) facing substantially the entire length of each mold 

half (13). A diffuser plate (18) closes each second chamber 
(16) and is positioned in close proximity with its 

respective mold half (13). The diffuser plate (18) has 
openings (19) for directing air from the second chamber 

(16) against the mold half (13). Each mold half has axial 
exhaust openings (20) extending from the space (24) between 

the mold half (13) and the exterior. The mold cooling 
apparatus can be applied to individual cavity as well as 

multi-cavity mold equipment. When a multi-cavity 
configuration is used, supplemental cooling is utilized 

through introduction of compressed air from a secondary 
source to axial and interconnected passages within the mold 

halves.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to mold supporting and cooling
apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a
method of cooling a mold in an apparatus for a glass forming
machine particularly to apparatus for cooling multiple
cavity molds.It has long been known that various arrangements can be
provided for cooling either single or multiple cavity molds
as shown, for example in US-patents 3 027 685, 3 094 404,
3 133 807, 3 137 560, 3 536 469, 3 586 491, 3 888 647,
4 067 711, 4 070 174, 4 388 099 and 4 668 269.Conventional I.S. type of glass ware forming machines
have a plurality of independent sections operated in timed
relationship to one another. Gobs of molten glass are
delivered from a glass feeding mechanism to upwardly open
blank molds where parisons are formed which are thereafter
inverted to deliver the formed parisons into blow molds for
final forming. Such machines are shown, for example, in US-patent
1 911 119.The blank and blow molds comprise complementary mold
halves which define the cavities. Where the molds are in a
multiple cavity configuration, supplement cooling is
required from a secondary source of compressed air. The
conventional or heretofore standard method for cooling I.S.
machine mold equipment has been with low pressure cooling
wind from a stationary distribution point directing the wind
to the external surfaces of the mold equipment. The
conventional cooling is limited by the changing position of
the mold equipment during the glassware forming process and
directional interference from the mold arms used to support
the mold equipment which are between the stationary wind
distributor parts and the mold equipment.An apparatus referred-to above is known from US-A-3
586 491. Here, the cooling wind is conducted through the 
mold arms to a central annular section around the mold where
the mold arms grip and support the mold. Between diffuser
plate and mold halves extends a space which is open at the
upper and lower ends of the mold halves. It is difficult to
deliver cooling air from a further source to such
configuration of the space.Vertically exending cooling channels through the walls of a
mold are already known (US-A-4,388,099). With such
construction, any additional cooling cannot be provided, nor
differential cooling between central and end sections of the
mold.It is already known from GB-A-2 256 868 to connect
vertically extending cooling passages to a distributing
passage midway between top and bottom of the mold and blow
air therethrough. Here, the cooling effect is evenly
