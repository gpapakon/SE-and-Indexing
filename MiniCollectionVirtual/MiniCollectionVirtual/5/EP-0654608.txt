<ABSTRACT>
In a rodless fluid pressure cylinder, in order to increase the speed it is proposed not to effect the braking by the flow resistance of the fluid medium flowing out of the front end of the housing but to introduce compressed air into this end space during the braking. Faster braking is thereby effected. The faster braking enables the cross-section of the fluid-medium outlet to be increased so that the flow resistance becomes smaller. The smaller flow resistance, which acts as a counterforce during the entire movement of the piston, permits a higher speed of the piston.

Method for the control of the movement of the piston (5) of a pressure 
medium cylinder, wherein by introducing a pressurized fluid into the partial 

inner space (2a, 2b) of the cylinder upstream of one end face (6) of the 
piston (5), the latter is driven, during the movement of the piston (5) the 

inner space (2b, 2a) of the cylinder upstream of the other end face (6) of the 
piston (5) is vented, characterized in that shortly before reaching the end of 

the movement the inner space (2b, 2a) upstream of the other end face (6) of 
the piston (5) is placed under pressure by introducing the pressurized fluid. 
Method according to claim 1, wherein both partial inner spaces (2a, 2b) of 
the cylinder are vented in the stationary state. 
Method according to one of the claims 1 or 2, wherein the particular drive 
inner space (2a, 2b) is vented prior to the stationary state and optionally 

simultaneously with the ventilating of the in each case other inner space 
(2b, 2a). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the counterventilation 
is initiated in time-dependent manner. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the position 
and/or speed of the piston (5) is measured and preferably the counterventilation 

is initiated as a function of the position and/or speed of the piston 
(5). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein after the start 
of braking a check is made to establish whether the piston (5) has reached the 

end of the path and optionally the counterventilation is interrupted. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, wherein the movement of 
the piston (5) at the end of the casing (1) is additionally decelerated by a 

shock absorber. 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder having a casing (1) provided with  
 

an inner space (2), a piston (5) displaceably located in the inner space (2) 
and which divides the latter into two mutually sealed partial spaces (2a, 2b), 

in the vicinity of each end of the casing (1) is in each case provided at 
least one pressure medium passage (7), which is connected to in each case one 

valve (9), as well as with a control device (12) for controlling the valves 
(9), which for moving the piston (5) connects the valve (9) associated with 

one partial space (2a, 2b) to a pressure medium source and the valve (9) 
associated with the other partial space (2b, 2a) is opened to the atmosphere, 

characterized in that the control device (12), shortly before reaching the end 
of the movement of the piston (5), connects said partial space (2b, 2a) to a 

pressure medium source by switching over the associated valve (9). 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder according to claim 8, in which, 
in the stationary state, the control device (12) opens the valve (9) associated 

with the two partial spaces (2a, 2b). 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder according to one of the claims 8 
or 9, wherein the control device (12) opens the valve (9) responsible for the 

drive prior to the stationary state and optionally simultaneously with the 
start of counterventilation. 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder according to one of the claims 8 
to 10, wherein the control device (12) has a timer (17), which initiates 

counterventilation at the end of a set time. 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder according to one of the claims 8 
to 11, having a measuring device (14) for measuring the position and/or speed 

of the piston (5). 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder according to one of the claims 8 
to 12, wherein the control device (12) is constructed in such a way that it 

can operate the valves (9) in synchronized manner. 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder according to one of the claims 8 
to 13, having a shock absorber for decelerating the piston (5) at the end of 

the casing (1).  
 
Piston rod-free pressure medium cylinder according to one of the claims 8 
to 14, having an input device (13) for fixing and/or modifying the counterventilation 

conditions.
