<ABSTRACT>
A plastic nut (1) for attachment to a threaded stud (12) so 
that the threaded portion (14) is screwed into the aperture (4) 

through the nut (1) in which edges formed by means of ridges (5) or 
grooves scrape off during screwing coating (13) covering the 

periphery of the threaded stud (12); the sides of the nut being 
formed with openings (7) extending outwardly from the edges of 

the aperture (4) to remove coating (13) scraped from the threaded 
stud to the outside.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a plastic nut 
which is capable of being attached to a threaded stud so 
that the threaded portion is screwed into an aperture formed 
through the nut in which edges are formed by means of ridges 
or grooves to scrape off during screwing a coating covering 
the periphery of the threaded stud. There is a known plastic nut which is capable of 
being attached to a threaded stud so that the threaded 
portion is screwed into an aperture formed through the nut 
in which edges are formed by means of ridges or grooves to 
scrape off during screwing a coating covering the periphery 
of the threaded stud. Such a nut is widely in use for 
attaching various components to a threaded stud welded e.g. 
to a vehicle body panel. When such a plastic nut is used, a 
coating formed by paint applied to the threaded stud is 
scraped off by the edges formed in the aperture but scraped 
coating can lodge in spaces in the aperture or get in roots 
of the inner threaded portion of the nut and this results in 
unsatisfactory fastening of the nut. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a plastic nut which is capable of 
maintaining satisfactory fastening of the nut even when the 
coating of threaded stud is scraped off. According to the present invention, we provide a 
plastic nut which is capable of being attached to a threaded 
stud so that the threaded portion is screwed into an 
aperture formed through the nut in which edges are formed by 
means of ridges or grooves to scrape off during screwing a 
coating covering the periphery of the threaded stud;
 
characterised in that the sides of the nut are formed with 
openings extending outwardly from the edges of the aperture 
to remove the scraped coating of the threaded stud to the 
outside. In order that the invention can be better 
understood, a preferred embodiment will now be described in  
 
greater detail by way of example with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which:- 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a plastic nut 
according to the present invention; Figure 2 is a plan view of the nut of Figure 1; Figure 3 is a front view of the nut of Figure 1; Figure 4 is a bottom view of the nut of Figure 1; Figure 5 is a side view of the nut of Figure 1; Figure 6 is a sectional view taken along the line 
A-A of Figure 2; Figure 7 is a sectional view taken along the line 
B-B of Figure 2; Figure 8 shows a threaded stud covered by a 
coating, and Figures 9 and 10 illustrate how the coating is 
removed by the use of the
