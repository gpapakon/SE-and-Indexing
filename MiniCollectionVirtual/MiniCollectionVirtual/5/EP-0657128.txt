Cold counter, in particular for shops, with a cold table (1) forming a
plinth, with a cooling device (6) arranged on the table plate (2) of the

cold table and having an evaporator (12) and a fan (14) delivering
cooling air through the evaporator, and with a plate-shaped cover or

lid (3), 
characterised in that
 the cooling device (6) is in the form of
a compact unit and is mounted on the table plate in a way such as to

be capable of being retracted from its operative position and lifted
away from the table plate (2).
Cold counter according to claim 1, characterised in that a work plate
(4) supported on the table plate (2) in the operative position of the

cooling device is secured to the cooling device (6).
Cold counter according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the
cooling device (6) has a box-shaped housing (7) formed in the

manner of a cover or lid and containing a channel (11) with an
evaporator (12) built into it, with which there is associated at least

one fan (14) for circulating cooling air.
Cold counter according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
a guide element (22) is provided at the outlet end (19, 20) of the

cooling device (6) for diverting the cooling air delivered to the
cooling device through the channel (11).
Cold counter according to claim 4, characterised in that the guide
element (22) is a flap which is pivoted to swing about a horizontal

axis and which in the operative position of the cooling device (6) has 
an end (26) which seals against the underside (27) of the work plate

(4).
Cold counter according to claim 5, characterised in that at least one
adjusting screw (23) serving for engagement by the flap is provided

for adjusting the position of the flap (22) in the operative position.
Cold counter according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that
the cooling device (6) is supported pivotally on levers (9, 10; 36).
Cold counter according to claim 7, characterised in that the levers
(10) which support the rear end of the cooling device (6) are longer

than the levers (9; 35) which support the front end.
Cold counter according to claim 7 or 8, characterised in that the
levers which support the front end of the cooling device (6) are

formed as cranked levers (9) or as straight levers (35) which pass
through a dead centre position on movement of the cooling device.
Cold counter according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that
a sprung shock absorber (38) is pivotally connected to at least one of

the levers (9, 10; 35).
Cold counter according to claim 10, characterised in that the shock
absorber (38) is a cylindrical air spring.
Cold counter according to claim 11, characterised in that a
compression spring (43) is mounted on the free end of the piston rod

(40) of the air spring (38) and in the lowered position of the cooling 
device (6) it puts the cylindrical housing (39) of the air spring (38)

under pressure.
Cold counter according to one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that
the cooling device (6) together with an under-structure (8) arranged

below it as well as the levers (9, 10; 35) which support the cooling
device on the under-structure are made in the form of a modular unit

capable of being installed and removed as a whole.
Cold counter according to claim 13, characterised in that the shock
absorber (38) is pivotally connected at one end to the tray-shaped

under-structure (8) and at its other end to a respective one of the
longer levers (10).
Cold counter according to claim 14, characterised in that the longer
levers (10) contain a number of holes (44) for selective engagement

of the shock absorber (38).
