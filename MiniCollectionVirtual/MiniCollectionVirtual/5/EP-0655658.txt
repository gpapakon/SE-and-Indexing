<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a carrier, conveyor 
member such as development sleeve and doctor blade and other 
friction charge-providing members for providing friction charge 
to a dry toner for use in the development of an electrostatic 
latent image in electrophotography, electrostatic recording, 
etc. In the electrophotographic image formation process, an 
electrostatic latent image is formed on an inorganic 
photoreceptor such as selenium, selenium alloy, cadmium sulfide 
and amorphous silicon or an organic photoreceptor comprising a 
charge-generating agent and a charge-transporting agent. The 
electrostatic latent image thus formed is developed with a 
toner, transferred to a paper or plastic film, and then fixed 
to obtain a visible image. Photoreceptors can be charged positively or negatively 
depending on their configuration. Photoreceptors which allow a 
printed area to be left as an electrostatic latent image are 
developed with an oppositely-chargeable toner while those which 
allow a printed area to be destaticized to effect reversal 
development are developed with a toner chargeable to the same 
sign as the printed area.  
 
In other words, if a negatively-chargeable photoreceptor is 
developed with an oppositely-chargeable toner and a positively-chargeable 
photoreceptor is subjected to reverse development, 
a positively-chargeable toner is used. A toner comprises a binder resin, a colorant, and other 
additives. In order to have desirable friction chargeability 
(charging rate, charging level, charging stability, etc.), age 
stability and environmental stability, the toner normally 
comprises a charge-controlling agent incorporated therein. 
Examples of the charge-controlling agent to be incorporated in 
the positively-chargeable toner include azinic dyes such as 
nigrosine, basic dyes such as triphenylmethane dyes, laked 
colors of basic dyes, metal complex dyes comprising quaternary 
ammonium residues incorporated in its skeletone, quaternary 
ammonium salts, laked compounds of quaternary ammonium salt, 
imidazole compounds, vinyl polymers containing an amino 
group(s), and condensed polymers containing an amino group(s). However, dry toners have varieties such as unitary, 
binary, magnetic and nonmagnetic toners depending on the 
development process. Charge-controlling agents capable of 
providing satisfactory chargeability to these toners have been 
rarely found and put into practical use. Even charge-controlling 
agents which are possibly fit for practical use 
preferably
