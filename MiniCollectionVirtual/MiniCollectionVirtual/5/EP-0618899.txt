<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain phenylene-dialkanoate 
esters which are useful as inhibitors of human 
neutrophil elastase (HNE) or equivalently human leukocyte 
elastase (HLE). HNE is a degradative enzyme implicated in a significant 
number of human disease states such as adult respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), emphysema, inflammatory bowel 
disease, ischemia reperfusion injury (myocardial 
infarction), periodontal disease, dermatitis, psoriasis, 
cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, artherosclerosis, 
Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. There is a need for 
effective inhibitors of HNE as therapeutic and as 
prophylactic agents for the treatment and/or prevention of 
elastase-mediated problems. Typical prior efforts to deal 
with elastase inhibition are disclosed in the patent  
 
literature, for instance U.S. Patents 4,683,241, 
4,801,610 and EP-A- 0465802. The principal object of the present invention is to 
provide certain new compounds which are useful as human 
neutrophil elastase inhibitors. These compounds are 
characterized by their relatively low molecular weight, 
high potency and selectivity with respect to HNE. They can 
be used effectively to prevent, alleviate or otherwise 
treat disease states characterized by the degradation of 
connective tissue by proteases in humans. The novel compounds of the invention may be 
structurally illustrated by the following formulae (I-III): 
 
or  
 
 
wherein: 
R₁, R₂, R₃ and R₄, which may be the same or different, 
are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl 
of 1-6 carbons, cycloalkyl of 3 to 6 carbons, alkenyl of 
2-6 carbons, or together represent methylene groups -(CH₂)n-where 
n is a whole number from 1 to 6, provided that R₁ and 
R₂ or R₃ and R₄ are not both hydrogen; R₅ and R₆, which may be the same or different, are 
selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, halogen (F, 
Cl, Br), nitro or -S(O)nR₇ where n is 0, 1 or 2 and R₇ is an 
optionally substituted alkyl of 1-12 carbons including for 
example, lower alkyl (1-6 carbons) bearing a carboxylic 
acid group such as -CH₂CO₂H, -C(CH₃)₂CO₂H or especially 
-CH₂C(CH₃)₂CO₂H or the corresponding ester group, i.e., 
-CH₂CO₂R₆, -C(CH₃)₂CO₂R₆ or -CH₂C(CH₃)₂CO₂R₆ where R₆ is lower 
alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl; and both Ar substituents are optionally substituted 
heteroaromatic rings or one Ar is an optionally substituted 
heteroaromatic ring and the other is optionally substituted 
phenyl, the optional substitution for Ar being halogen, 
nitro or -S(O)nR₇
