<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluoromonomer 
polymerization process conducted in the presence of an 
initiator and in a solvent which contains only C, F and 
H and optionally ether oxygen or alcohol, and which does 
not cause appreciable chain transfer or otherwise 
interfere with the polymerization of fluoromonomers. The 
polymers obtained are useful as thermoplastics and 
elastomers. Solvents are useful components of free radical 
catalyzed fluoromonomer polymerization processes. Even 
if the polymerization is not carried out in an organic 
solvent, for example in aqueous emulsion, small amounts 
of organic solvents are often useful, for example for 
adding organic soluble components such as initiators. 
Polymerization of monomers containing vinylic fluorine 
is often difficult, for example undergoing chain 
transfer or termination reactions in the presence of 
many organic compounds that contain hydrogen bound to 
carbon. The presence of such compounds results in 
polymers with lower molecular weights than desired 
and/or a lowered yield of polymer. Various compounds 
have been proposed as solvents for such polymerizations. Among the solvents which have been disclosed for 
fluoromonomer polymerizations are compounds containing 
(besides carbon): chlorine, fluorine and hydrogen (see 
for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,499,249, 4,714,756, 
3,635,926, 4,029,868, 3,528,954, and Re. 32,199); 
fluorine (see for example U.S. Patent Nos. 3,635,926,  
 
Re. 32,199, 4,499,249, and 4,948,844); and chlorine and 
fluorine (see U.S. Patent No. 4,948,844). None of these 
patents mentions the use of solvents containing only C, 
F and H. U.S. Patent No. 3,616,371 discloses the use of 
various fluorinated solvents, including C2H3F3 and 
C2H4F2, for use in polymerizations to form homo- or 
copolymers of vinylidene fluoride. No other solvents 
containing only carbon, hydrogen and fluorine are 
mentioned. U.S. Patent No. 4,123,602, at Col. 5, lines 52-60, 
discloses the use of various fluorocarbon type solvents. Japanese Patent Application 1/151,293 discloses the 
use of compounds of the formula CH3R, where R is 
perhaloethyl or perhalomethyl ("halo" including 
fluorine) as solvents for the production of fluorine 
containing polymers. This application states that the 
groups -CH2F and -CH2 ".... have substantial chain 
transfer capability to fluoroolefins, ...". No other 
compounds, aside from CH3R, are mentioned as useful 
solvents for the polymerization. U.S. Patent No.4,243,770 discloses a process for 
producing an easily
