<ABSTRACT>
Each of even series outputs of a CCD (11) is clamped by a 
third capacitor (C3) and a fifth transistor (ASW5) in a high 

precise mode of a reader. Each of odd series outputs of the CCD 
is clamped by a first capacitor (C1) and a second transistor 

(ASW2). The clamped odd and even series outputs are converted 
to digital signals by a first AD converter (AD1). In a high 

speed mode of the reader, odd series outputs of the CCD are 
clamped in a unit of one line period by first and second 

capacitors (C1, C2) and the second transistor. In the high speed 
mode, even series outputs of the CCD are clamped in the unit of 

one line period by third and fourth capacitors (C3, C4) and a 
fifth transistor. The clamped odd and even series outputs are 

respectively converted to digital signals by individual first 
and second AD converters (AD1, AD2). In this reader, the high 

precise mode or the high speed mode can be selected in 
accordance with necessity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a reader using an image
sensor such as a CCD (charge coupled device) sensor.Recently, a reader using a CCD sensor has been widely used
as a means for inputting documents and graphic data to a
computer, or an inputting means of each of a digital copying
machine and a facsimile telegraph.Fig. 9 is a block diagram of a CCD sensor used in such a
reader. In this reader, signals of odd series analog shift
registers and even series analog shift registers are finally
synthesized in a line and outputted. Each of S1, S2, ---, SN
designates a light receiving portion. Each of OSR1, OSR2, ---,
OSRN/2 designates an odd side shift register for shift-out of
an analog output of each of odd side light receiving portions
arranged in an odd series. Each of ESR1, ESR2, ---, ESRN/2
designates an even side shift register for shift-out of an
analog output of each of even side light receiving portions
arranged in an even series. BUFF designates a buffer
amplifier. SH designates a start pulse for starting a shifting
operation of each of the shift registers. Each of 1 and 2
designates a transfer pulse. R designates a reset pulse. 
CCDOUT designates an output of a charge coupled device (CCD).Fig. 5 shows a CCD sensor having two output channels.
This CCD sensor can perform a scanning operation at a speed at
least two times in comparison with the charge coupled device
(CCD) shown in Fig. 9. Each of S1, S2, ---, SN designates a
light receiving portion. Each of OSR1, OSR2, ---, OSRN/2
designates an odd side shift register for shift-out of an
analog output of each of odd side light receiving portions
arranged in an odd series. Each of ESR1, ESR2, ---, ESRN/2
designates an even side shift register for shift-out of an
analog output of each of even side light receiving portions
arranged in an even series. OBUFF designates an odd side
buffer amplifier. EBUFF designates an even side buffer
amplifier. SH designates a start pulse for starting a shifting
operation of each of the shift registers. Each of 1 and 2
designates a transfer pulse. Each of RE and RO designates a
reset pulse. OCCDOUT designates an output of a charge coupled
device (CCD) in each of the odd side light receiving portions.
ECCDOUT designates an output of a charge coupled device (CCD)
in each of the even side light receiving portions.US-A-4 772 958 discloses an image reader using such a CCD sensor having
two output channels. In this image reader, each of an odd side
output and an even side output is converted to a digital signal
