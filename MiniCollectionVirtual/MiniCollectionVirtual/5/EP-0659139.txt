<ABSTRACT>
The device for the automatic adjusting, according to the pressure, of the length of the connection rope between a buoy and a skin-diver comprises a means (1) for winding and unwinding a rope (C) for the connection between a floating buoy and an immersed skin-diver, for determining the automatic adjusting of its length following to the indications supplied by a sensor (6) for the taking of the pressure, provided on the skin-diver himself or on his spear gun or on any other housing. The information about the reached depth is transmitted to said means (1) by means of an emitter (4) of acoustic waves with a relative receiver (5) or, in a variant, by means of electric impulses through an electric cable (8) for the connection between a skin-diver and a buoy (B).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device for the automatic 
adjusting, according to the pressure, of the length of the 
connection rope between a buoy and a skin-diver. The present invention takes its origin from the need to 
take the exact position of skin-divers with repect to the 
floating indicator buoy, so as to reduce the dangers 
deriving from incidents caused by arriving floating means. At present, the connection rope between said buoy and the 
skin-diver has always the same length, thus representing 
only the limit of the reciprocal distance. It is the aim of the present invention to determine the 
unwinding of a wound-up rope and therefore its 
differential elongation according to the taking of the 
hydrostatic pressure reached by the immersed skin-diver. The aim set forth is reached by means of the device 
according to claim 1 of the present invention.  
 Of course, the device for unwinding the rope may be 
provided, according to the present invention, in 
correspondence with the buoy, and in that case the 
connection with the pressure sensor is realized with an 
acoustic emitter, of the sonar kind, or by means of an 
electrical connection obtained inside said rope, or said 
device - in a possible variant - may be carried by the 
skin-diver, may be applied to the spear gun or in any 
other place. The present invention will be explained more in detail 
hereinbelow according to the enclosed drawings, in which 
some preferred embodiments are shown. 
Figure 1shows a scheme of a device for the automatic 
adjusting, according to the hydrostatic pressure, 
of the length of the connection rope between a 
buoy and a skin-diver. Figure 2shows a block scheme of the functioning of the 
device according to the present invention.  
 Figures 3 and 4show some possible variants of the device 
according to the present invention. The figures show a device for the automatic adjusting, 
according to the pressure, of the length of the connection 
rope between a buoy and a skin-diver, of the kind that can 
be inserted during the realization into floating buoys B 
of new kind, or also applied to the lower ring of already 
existing buoys B, comprising: 
a mechanism 1 for winding and unwnding a rope C, that 
can supply the length of the rope according to the 
values of the hydrostatic pressure taken by a sensor 2 
inserted inside a watch, or otherwise carried by the immersed skin-diver; an electric motor 3, or any other kind of motor, for the 
operating of the mechanism 1; a pressure sensor 6 for transforming the
