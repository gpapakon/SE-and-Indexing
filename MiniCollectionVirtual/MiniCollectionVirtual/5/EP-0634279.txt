<ABSTRACT>
A printing apparatus capable of printing by moving 
a carriage (2) mounting a printing head (1) to a recording paper (8) 

detects a movement of the carriage (2) for a predetermined 
distance by an encoder, clocks the time for the carriage (2) 

to move in the distance, and obtains the moving speed of 
the carriage (2) in accordance with the clocked time. Time 

interval for printing by the printing head (1) is determined 
by the carriage moving speed, and a printing is 

performed at a constant printing density in an 
acceleration/deceleration area in addition to the area 

when the carriage is moving at a constant speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a printing
apparatus and printing method which moves a printing
head to a printing medium.Conventionally, in a serial-type printer which
performs printing by scanning a printing head in the
main scanning direction, and by moving a recording
medium such as a recording paper in the sub-scanning
direction, printing is performed by moving a carriage
mounting the printing head by a carriage motor. In this
case, the printing is performed in synchronism with the
moving of the carriage while a position of the carriage
is being detected by an encoder. Fig. 8 is a diagram
showing the position relationship between the printing
area of the printing apparatus and the carriage moving
range in the main scanning direction (speed, range in
the main scanning direction). The
carriage moves at a constant speed in the printing area,
and an acceleration and a deceleration are
respectively provided before and after the printing area
for acceleration and deceleration based on the
characteristic of the carriage motor. 
Accordingly, in the conventional printer apparatus, the
acceleration/deceleration area needs to be provided on
the both sides of the printing area, the total scanning
distance of the carriage in the main scanning direction
becomes longer than the length in the printing area.
Accordingly, a problem arises in that the apparatus
become large in size. Particularly, in a color printing
apparatus having a plurality of printing heads in the
main scanning direction and a cartridge containing ink
used for printing, not only the moving distance of the
carriage becomes longer, but also the acceleration area
to accelerate the carriage speed to a predetermined speed
and the deceleration area to decelerate and suspend the
carriage movement need to be longer due to the increase
of the carriage weight. Accordingly, the length of the
carriage scanning direction becomes longer, and this is
a main problem in minimizing the entire apparatus in
size.EP-A-491957 discloses a printing control system
capable of printing at a given density even during the
acceleration or deceleration of a carriage of a printer.
The control system emits pulses indicating the position
of the carriage at predetermined distances. The running
speed of the carriage is measured based on the time
intervals between the pulses. The system estimates the
time at which the carriage will reach a position for
printing based on the measured running speed and drive 
the print head to perform printing at the estimated time.EP-A-0390125
