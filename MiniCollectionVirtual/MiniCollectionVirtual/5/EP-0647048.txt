<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a base/portable terminal assembly in which the base is linked (1) to a telephone (TEL) and to a telephone line (L), the link between the terminal and the line being provided when the terminal is placed on the base by opposing, visible contacts. Four contacts (4a1-4a4) are provided on the base and four (4b1-4b4) on the terminal. The base comprises switches (S1-S4) which are actuated together by the weight of the terminal in order, when the terminal is placed on the base, to link the four contacts of the base to the two wires (T1,T2) of the telephone and to the two conductors (L1,L2) of the line, and when the terminal is raised from the base, to establish a link between each wire of the line and each wire of the telephone, the contacts of the base (4a1-4a4) then no longer being connected.

<CLAIMS>
A base/portable terminal assembly in which the
base (1) is connected to a telephone set (TEL) and to a telephone

line (L) and in which the connection between the terminal and the
telephone line is ensured when the terminal is laid on the base

with coinciding apparent contacts, characterized in that it
includes, to ensure said connection, four contacts (4a1-4a4) on

the base and four contacts on the terminal (4b1-4b4), and in that
the base includes switching means (S1-S4) driven together by the

weight of the terminal for,

when the terminal rests on the base, connecting the
four contacts of the base, and thus of the terminal, respectively

to the two wires of the telephone set (T1, T2) and to the two
conductors (L1, L2) of the telephone line, and
when the terminal is lifted up from the base, establishing
a connection between each wire of the line and each wire

of the telephone set, the base contacts (4a1-4a4) then no longer
being connected.
The base/portable terminal assembly of claim 1,
characterized in that the switching means include four switches

that include:

a first and a second one-way switch (S1, S2) between
the wires (T1, T2) of the telephone set and the first and second

contacts (4a1, 4a2), these first and second switches being open
in the absence of the terminal, and
a third and a fourth two-way switch (S3, S4) having
their fixed terminals connected to the line conductors (L1, L2)

and their mobile terminals connected either to the terminals (T1,
T2)of the telephone set, or, in the presence of the terminal, to

the third and fourth contacts (4a3, 4a4).
The base/portable terminal assembly of claim 2,
characterized in that the portable terminal includes fifth and

sixth two-way switches (S5, S6) having their common terminals
connected to the third and fourth contacts (4b3, 4b4) and having

their mobile terminals connected either to a line transformer 
(13), or to the first and second contacts (4b1, 4b2), this terminal

further including a signal detector (11) interposed between
the first and second contacts and the mobile terminals of the

fifth and sixth switches, a line connection circuit (12) and a
central processing terminal and a modem (14).
