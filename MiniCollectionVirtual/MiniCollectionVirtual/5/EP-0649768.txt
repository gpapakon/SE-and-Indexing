<ABSTRACT>
A dynamic braking grid arrangement for reducing 
EMI generated by dynamic or partial regenerative 

electrical braking of an electric traction motor 
powered vehicle coupled to a wayside power source by 

a third rail or catenary. The grid arrangement 
comprises a high-power dissipation resistance grid 

having a plurality of separately defined resistance 
elements, each having a generally elongate 

configuration. Mounting means support each of the 
grid elements adjacent to and parallel with each 

other of the elements. A plurality of electrical 
conduction devices connect the elements into an 

electrical circuit such that current passes through 
at least one element in a first direction and 

through at least one adjacent element in a second 
opposite direction such that EMI generated by any 

one element is substantially cancelled by EMI 
generated by an adjacent element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electric power 
systems for electrically propelled and retarded 
vehicles and, more particularly, to a method and 
apparatus for reducing EMI during electrical dynamic 
braking of electric traction motor powered vehicles. Electric power conversion systems are used to 
condition the electric power supplied to motor load 
circuits from a direct current (DC) source of 
relatively constant voltage. If supplying DC 
motors, such a system will include an electric power 
"chopper" that is suitably controlled to vary the 
magnitude of load current and/or voltage as desired. 
Alternatively, in the case of alternating current 
(AC) motors, the system will include an electric 
power "inverter" that is suitably controlled to vary 
the amplitude and frequency of load voltage as 
desired. In either case, electric power flows from 
the DC source terminals to the load terminals of the 
controllable converter during "motoring" operation  
 
or in a reverse direction during "electrical 
braking". Such a system is useful for propelling a rapid 
transit vehicle, in which case the source comprises 
a wayside conductor and the load comprises windings 
of at least one traction motor whose rotatable shaft 
is mechanically coupled through torque-increasing 
gearing to an axle-wheel set of the vehicle. The 
wayside conductor is typically energized by a 
relatively low voltage DC power generating plant 
located near the right of way along which the 
vehicle travels. In its motoring or propulsion mode 
of operation, the converter is so controlled that 
the DC voltage applied to its source terminals is 
converted into adjustable voltage at its load 
terminals, and the traction motor(s) responds by 
producing torque to accelerate the vehicle or 
maintain its speed as desired. In the alternative electrical braking or 
retarding mode of operation of the power conversion 
system, the converter is so controlled that each 
motor acts as a generator driven by the inertia of 
the vehicle and supplies electric power which flows 
in a reverse direction through the converter and 
appears as direct and unipolarity voltage at the 
source terminals. As this electrical energy is used 
or dissipated, the traction motor(s) responds by 
absorbing kinetic energy and slowing the vehicle. 
Electrical braking is achieved by a combination of 
dynamic braking and regenerative braking. Dynamic 
braking is effected by connecting a dynamic braking 
resistance between the DC source terminals. This 
resistance receives current from
