Seat accessory (1), viz. for forming an upholstery capable of being
placed at the level of the back (14b) and the seating (14a) of the seat (14), comprising

a cover (2) inside which is placed a filling liquid, characterized in that:

the structure (3) of the cover (2) comprises means (4) formed of a network
of transversal cells (5; 26-33) communicating with each other,
the cells (5; 26-33) have a size varying according to a predetermined distribution,
in order to confer a profile to the structure (3) of the cover (2),
the transversal cells (5; 26-33) of the seating portion (12; 17) and of the
back portion (11; 36) communicate with each other at the level of the line of

folding (13; 35) of the structure (3) through a communicating hole (34),
the structure (3) of the cover (2) has a peripheral rim formed of four
rims (15, 16, 18, 19; 51-54), i.e. an upper rim (51), a lower rim (52) and two side

rims (53, 54),
each rim (51-54) is formed by a cell,
the cells of the rims (51-54) communicate with each other and with the
network of transversal cells (5; 26-33) through the holes (41, 42), the cells of

the side rims (53, 54) ensuring a communication between the seating portion
(12; 37) and the back portion (11; 36),
the communication between all the cells, both those of the back portion
(11; 36) and those of the seating portion (12; 37) allows an automatic compensation

of the movements and distortions of the spinal column and the sacrum
and the moulding of the lumbo-gluteal structures maintaining their anatomo-physiologic

relationship peculiar to each individual through controlled
distribution and conveying of the liquid.
Accessory according to claim 1, characterized in that the network of
cells (5) communicate with each other via baffles formed through at least one

hole (34) provided for at at least one of their ends.
Accessory according to claim 2, characterized in that the intercellular
communicating holes (34) have a vertical bulge (43).
Accessory according to claim 2, characterized in that the intercellular
communicating holes (34) are alternately arranged in order to ensure a zigzag

circulation of the fluid.
Accessory according to claim 1, characterized in that the filling liquid
includes additives in order to have an appropriate viscosity. 
Accessory according to claim 1, characterized in that the structure (3)
includes elements (21, 22, 23) for maintaining the liquid at a desired temperature.
