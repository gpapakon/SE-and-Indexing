<ABSTRACT>
Composite chemical barrier films and fabrics that are particularly useful in protective garments. The composite barrier material may be made by laminating a barrier film (22) to a flexible substrate (24) using a thermoplastic resin (23) and topcoating the barrier film with a similar or dissimilar thermoplastic resin (21) to allow fabric seaming when the fabric is fabricated into a protective garment. Protective garments made from the materials are lightweight while maintaining an adequate balance of strength and chemical protection.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLECOMPOSITE CHEMICAL BARRIERFABRIC FOR PROTECTIVE GARMENTSFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a composite material particularly useful in making chemical protective garments. In particular,, this invention relates to a composite film suitable for use in protective garments. In addition, this invention relates to a lightweight composite fabric, comprised of a flexible substrate laminated to this composite film. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn particular situations people may encounter harmful concentrations of hazardous chemicals. In such situations, it is necessary to wear chemical protective garments of special composition and construction. These protective garments are necessary for providing an effective barrier between the wearer and the chemicals encountered. However, as pointed out in U.S. Patent 4,855,178 (Langley) , in addition to providing an effective chemical barrier, materials for chemical protective garments should meet practical requirements for amenability to fabrication by existing me-thods (e.g., heat bonding of seams) as well as for providing sufficient strength to prevent tearing and the resulting loss of protection. General practice in the protective garment trade is to construct chemical protective garments by seaming together panels of chemical protective garment material. These seams may be formed in a number of ways . The seams may be formed by traditional methods of sewing and then covering the seam with a layer of heat sealing tape. Alternatively, the seams may be 

formed by heat or ultrasonic welding of the garment material. These seams may utilize adhesives.Suitable chemical protective garment materials must be flexible to allow manipulation during seaming on standard seaming equipment, whether it be by sewing, adhesives or heat sealing. The chemical protective garment materials must also be of a composition that allows the formation of strong sealed seams, whether these seams are sewn and taped, adhesively joined or whether they are welded by heat or ultrasonic energy.In addition, chemical protective garments must be durable in use. The garments must not develop structural failures during use which would expose the wearer to hazardous chemicals. Thus, the chemical protective garment materials and the seams created in constructing the garments must be strong and resistant to structural failure (e.g., to tearing, cracking or shrinking) . In many situations, it is not feasible to decontaminate chemical protective garments after exposure to hazardous
