<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLETechnetium-99m Complexes with N-substituted 3-Hydroxy-4-pyridinonesBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to cationic radiopharmaceutical complexes of technetium-99m (Tc-99m or 9 mrpC) ancj particularly to cationic complexes of Tc- 99m with N-substituted 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinones . Such cationic complexes are useful in diagnostic scintigraphic imaging.Other heterocyclic complexes of radioactive metals have previously been reported in patents and scientific literature. For example:Baker et al., in U.S. Patent No. 3,981,980, disclose a diagnostic substance for cholescintigraphy which is formed by the reaction of pyridoxal and amino acids, labelled with a radionuclide, in pyrogen-free water, the reaction product being adjusted to a pH of 8 to 9 and then autoclaved and cooled to produce a sterile, pyrogen-free non-antigenic solution for injection for biliary scanning.Frank et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,193,979 disclose complexes of the compound sodium 3- [ [2- (2-methyl-5- nitro-lH-imidazol-1-yl) ethyl]-amino] carbonyl] -2-pyridine carboxylic acid (and related compounds) with radioactive technetium-99m. These complexes are disclosed for use as radiopharmaceutical imaging agents, and in 

 particular, these complexes are useful as gallbladder and liver imaging agents.Thakur, in U.S. Patent No. 4,443,426, discloses an agent for labelling blood cells comprising a complex of a radioactive metal (e.g., Tc-99m) with an N-oxide of pyridine. This complex is disclosed for use for the j i vivo imaging of blood cells for diagnostic purposes.Feld et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,714,065, disclose technetium-99m labeled dioxime complexes for imaging the myocardium, brain and hepatobiliary systems of humans and other mammalian species .Srivastava et al. , in U.S. Patent No. 4,764,598, disclose a class of radiolabeled compounds as imaging agents with rapid brain uptake, good brain/blood radioactivity ratios, and long retention times. The imaging agents comprise radioiodinated aromatic amines attached to dihydropyridine carriers.Benedict et al., in U.S. Patent No. 4,830,847, disclose diphosphonate-derived macromolecules, such as proteins, as being suitable for use as technetium-99m based scanning agents. The scanning agents are prepared by combining Tc-99m in a +3, +4 and/or +.5 oxidation state with the diphosphonate derivatized macromolecules . Also disclosed are pharmaceutical compositions containing these diphosphonate derivatized macromolecules and methods for scintigraphic imaging using these
