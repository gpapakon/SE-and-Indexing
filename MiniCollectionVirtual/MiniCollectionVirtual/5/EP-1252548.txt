<ABSTRACT>
A method of and apparatus for creating a second order non-linearity profile along a waveguide. The method comprises: thermally poling a waveguide structure to generate a second order non-linearity; placing a mask adjacent to the waveguide structure; and exposing the waveguide structure with UV light through the mask to selectively erase the second order non-linearity along the waveguide structure. The mask may be an amplitude mask or phase mask. In a preferred embodiment an amplitude mask is used in combination with an incoherent UV light source to produce selective erasure of a thermally poled second order non-linearity. Apparatus for carrying out this method and devices based on waveguide structures fabricated using the method are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONPERIODIC OPTICAL POLING OF WAVEGUIDES FOR QUASI PHASE MATCHINGBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to methods and apparatus for inducing a varying second-order non-linearity profile in optical fibres and other waveguides, and to waveguides having such a varying second-order non-linearity profile.Waveguides with periodically varying second-order non-linearities are of interest, since they can be used to provide quasi-phase matching (QPM). In non-linear glasses, QPM is usually achieved by periodically alternating regions with non-linearity (poled sections) and regions without non-linearity (unpoled sections). In this way the phase-mismatch accumulated in each poled section is reset in the unpoled one (where the absence of the non-linearity prevents back conversion), so that in the next poled section the fields have the right phase relation for constructive growth of the generated signals.QPM devices have potential applications for optically integrated frequency conversion of coherent light sources, wavelength routing in telecommunication systems, all-optical switching via cascading of second-order non-linearities, parametric fluorescence for quantum applications (such as cryptography and metrology), and high speed modulation.Since its proposal [1] QPM has been implemented in many materials including lithium niobate, semiconductors and polymers. Several configurations have been employed to achieve efficient second-order non-linear optical interactions. QPM allows one to access new wavelengths and to provide higher efficiency and non- critical interaction geometries. QPM also provides flexibility and new possibilities for phase-matching, especially in materials where the birefringence is not high enough to compensate for the dispersion and where modal phase-matching is not desirable in order to avoid the generation of light in higher order modes. 

 QPM devices can be fabricated by periodic poling of waveguides. Here and throughout this document the term "periodic poling" is used to mean a varying second- order non-linearity profile, not necessarily of a single frequency. Periodic poling exploits the potential of the QPM technology to extend the possibility of efficient frequency conversion to materials, which are in widespread use in optical applications, such as silica and germanosilicate optical glass. This is advantageous since silica and some other optical glasses exhibit high transparency, are low cost, have high optical damage thresholds, and are
