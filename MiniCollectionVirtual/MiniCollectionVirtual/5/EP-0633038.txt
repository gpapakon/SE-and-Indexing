<ABSTRACT>
The invention specifies a tube connector for connection of tubing lines for medical purposes, comprising a first coupling member (3) with an internal cone (24) and outside projections (25) lying diametrically opposite and representing a fragment of a double external screw thread, and a second coupling member (2) with an external cone (9) and a freely rotatable connection member (4) whose tube socket (28), which is open in the direction of the first coupling member (3), has an internal screw thread (26) for reception of the external screw thread formed by the projections, and having a rotation-preventing mechanism. The latter is formed by locking strips (27) which are arranged diametrically opposite in the central region of the first coupling member (3), project radially and whose functional surfaces interact with engagement projections (29) or their functional surfaces (30, 31) arranged diametrically opposite on the inner casing of the elastically deformable tube socket (28).

<CLAIMS>
Tube coupling for the connection of tube lines
for medical purposes, comprising a first coupling part

(3) with an inner cone (24) and diametrically opposite
projections (25) on the outside, which represent a

fragment of a two-turn external thread, and a second
coupling part (2) with an outer cone (9) and a freely

rotatable connection part (4) whose pipe connector (28)
which is open in the direction of a first coupling part

(3) has an internal thread (26) to receive the external
thread formed by the projections (25), characterized in

that a rotational latching mechanism is provided, which
is formed by radially projecting locking webs (27)

which are located diametrically opposite one another in
the central region of the fir
st coupling part (3) and
whose functional surfaces interact with latching

projections (29) or their functional surfaces (30, 31)
located diametrically opposite one another on the inner

surface of the elastically deformable pipe connector
(28).
