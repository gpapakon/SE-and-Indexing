<DESCRIPTION>
A method for packaging a product for sterilization and a sterilized package manufactured by the methodThe invention relates to a method for packaging a product for sterilization effected by irradiation, wherein the product is enclosed in a substantially gas impermeable package. The invention also relates to a sterilized package manufactured by the method.Sterile packages, such as packages for hospital equipment, are often bag-like, airproof, or air per¬ meable but bacterium impermeable packages in which the equipment to be packaged is placed before the packages are sealed. Sterilization is effected by irradiating the package by ionizing radiation, such as gamma radiation, ultraviolet light or by some other means. The products to be packaged may be surgical textiles, surgical instruments, various tubes, syringes, cannulae, etc.The problem with packages of this type is that when opened, they give off a strong odour. Radiation causes the oxygen within the package to be converted into ozone, which reacts with the molecular chain of the product, which is usually plastic-based, to form bad- smelling compounds, such as acetic acid and butanal. Moreover, an oxidizing environment reduces the mechan- ical strength of the plastic products placed in the packages. This problem has been discussed e.g. in European Patent No. 218 003. The package disclosed in this reference comprises a deoxidizer, such as activated iron oxide, for the elimination of odour. The solution requires, however, a two-layer package: a breathing inner layer and a tight outer layer, between which the deoxidizing - and thus deodorizing - agent is posi¬ tioned. The disadvantages of such a package are that it is complicated and that iron oxide must be separately added thereto. 

 The object of the present invention is to provide such a method for sterilizing a package, and a sterilized package manufactured by the method, by means of which the product can be easily and securely packaged for sterilization, and in which the problem of odour caused by radiation in the corresponding known products has been minimized. To achieve this, the method accord¬ ing to the invention is characterized in that the product is placed in the package, the package is de- aerated and filled with a protective gas, whereafter the package is sealed for sterilization by irradiation.The invention has the advantages that, in addi¬ tion to being odourless, the package is uncomplicated, and the different steps of manufacture can be rapidly taken. The same nozzle can be used both

Claims
1. A method for packaging a product for steril¬ ization effected by irradiation, wherein the product (1) is enclosed in a substantially gas impermeable package (2), c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the product (1) is placed in the package (2), the package is deaerated and filled with a protective gas, whereafter the package is sealed for sterilization by irradiation. 2. A method according to claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the protective gas is nitrogen. 3. A method according to claim 1, c h a r a c ¬ t e r i z e d in that the protective gas is carbon dioxide. 4. A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the package is de¬ aerated in such a manner that the amount of residual oxygen does not exceed 1% of the amount of gas contained in the package after the addition of the protective gas. 5. A substantially gas impermeable package (2) sterilized by irradiation, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that it comprises a package containing a product (1), the package (2) being substantially deaerated and filled with a protective gas for sterilization by irradiation. 6. A package according to claim 4, c h a r ¬ a c t e r i z e d in that the protective gas contained in the package is nitrogen.
