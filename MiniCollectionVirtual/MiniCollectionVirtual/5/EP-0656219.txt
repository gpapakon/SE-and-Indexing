<ABSTRACT>
An analysis device (36) for identifying abnormal conditions 
in a heart (4), retrograde conduction and tachyarrhythmias 

in particular, is described. The analysis device (36) comprises 
a differentiating circuit (42) in order to differentiate 

ECG signals from the heart (4). The differentiated 
signal is plotted against the ECG signal, and the radius in 

the resulting curve is calculated in a calculator unit (44). 
The radius obtained is then compared with a threshold value 

in a comparator (46), and a sequence for the radius' progression 
in relation to the threshold value is obtained and 

compared with previously sequences stored in a sequence 
analyzer (50).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an analysis device for
analyzing electrical signals from a heart comprising a
measurement unit for generating a measurement signal related
to the electrical activity of the heart and an evaluation
unit for identifying abnormal conditions in the heart on the
basis of the measurement signal.The present invention also relates to a heart stimulator for
detecting and treating tachyarrhythmias in a heart.In the diagnosis and treatment of patients with various
defects in their cardiac function, the ability to make
reliable distinctions between normal and abnormal events in
the heart is important. The heart's intrinsic signals, i.e.
the ECG signals, have long been used for distinguishing
between normal and various abnormal conditions. From the document "Phase Plane Plot of Electrograms as a Marker of Ventricular Electrical
Instability During Acute Ischemia: Initial Experimental Results and Potential Clinical
Applications" (H. S. Karagueuzian et al.: PACE, 1992, Part II, 2188-2193) it is known, that
abnormal heart conditions can be identified by analysing the shape of plots which ensues
when the electrogram of the heart and the derivative of the electrogram are used as
coordinates in a coordinate system. The ability to distinguish normal heart conditions from
abnormal conditions is especially important when it comes to
tachyarrhythmias. Examination of the heart rate alone is not
enough for reliable determination of whether a tachyarrhythmia
is present or not. Some hearts manage to operate normally
at rates up to about 200 beats a minute, whereas other
hearts develop unstable tachyarrhythmias at rates of only
100-120 a minute. So the use of parameters other than the
heart rate is necessary for establishing whether a heart is
afflicted by unstable tachyarrhythmia.Retrograde conduction from a ventricle to an atrium is
another cardiac defect whose identification is important.
Retrograde conduct-on impairs the heart's pumping capacity
and can trigger PMT's (pacemaker mediated tachycardia), i.e. 
a tachycardia evoked and sustained by a heart stimulator.The invention aims to achieve an analysis device for reliable
identification of abnormal conditions in a heart.The invention further aims to achieve a heart stimulator
which can be used for diagnosing and treating tachyarrhythmias.One such analysis device is achieved in accordance with the
invention in that the device of the preamble is devised so
the device further comprises a differentiating circuit which
is connected to the
