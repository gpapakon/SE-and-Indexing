<ABSTRACT>
An ultrasonic probe is housed in a probe 
housing filled with fluid under pressure. The probe 

provides ultrasonic sound through the fluid to a bladder 
(17) which presses against the interior of a rotor wall. 

Located along the periphery of the bladder, a fluid wiper/soaker 
conduit (16.1) provides droplets of fluid to the 

wall of the rotor bore to minimize friction between the 
bladder and the rotor bore wall and provide an ultrasonic 

path between the bladder and the rotor bore wall.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to techniques for 
inspecting rotor bores and, in particular, the use of a 
ultrasonic booted-head probe for rotor bore inspection. For many years, there has been increasing interest 
and a growing demand for equipment and methods that can be 
used to inspect power generation turbine and generator 
rotors for material discontinuities and degradation, which 
can lead to premature and possible catastrophic rotor 
failure. Through the use of these inspection techniques, 
rotor life can be extended. The center portion of the 
steel forging, from which the rotors are made, are the 
regions most susceptible to rotor discontinuity and other 
forms of material degradation. In fact, one reason that a 
central bore hole is machined in most rotors is to provide 
the capability to remove suspicious material. Moreover, 
the operating conditions in the region of the central bore 
holes in these rotors can produce thermal creep, fatigue 
and thermal embrittlement, particularly, if there are 
forging discontinuities. It is with these problems in mind 
that there is a great interest in developing techniques for 
enabling accurate rotor inspection, especially techniques 
using non-destructive inspection methods. Ultrasonic inspection within the. bore is a process 
that has been used since the early to mid-1980's with 
fairly wide acceptance as a practical high volume inspection  
 
technique. Ultrasonic inspection, also known as boresonic 
inspection, uses ultrasonic transducers that are 
transported through the central bore hole by any convenient 
method. The transducers generate ultrasonic beams that are 
directed from the bore surface into the rotor material, 
producing an ultra sonic wave that penetrates the rotor 
material. By collecting, processing and observing the 
reflective characteristics of the wave within the forging, 
the integrity of the material can be deduced. An entire 
rotor is inspected by placing the transducers around the 
rotor's inner circumference and along the length of the 
bore and directing the ultrasonic beam into the material. Some traditional methods of ultrasonic rotor bore 
inspection employ a "contact" probe, which nothing more 
than a transducer housed on a rigid shoe that slides along 
the bore surface on a layer of oil. The profile of the 
shoe is matched to the bore curvature. Though this inspection 
technique has been widely accepted as a near industry 
standard, it presents some serious drawbacks. The "contact 
probe" provides low resolution and
