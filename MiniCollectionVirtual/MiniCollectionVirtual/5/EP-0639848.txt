<ABSTRACT>
In an oxide cathode comprising a metal base, an electron emissive 
material layer containing at least Ba formed on the metal base, and a means 

for heating the electron emissive material layer, the electron emissive material 
layer further comprises at least one of a lanthanum oxide and a terbium oxide, 

and forms a needle-shaped crystal structure, or the electron emissive material 
layer further comprises at least one of a lanthanum oxide and a terbium oxide, 

and the metal base is subject to a heat treatment under vacuum. The oxide 
cathode has an effect on lengthening the lifetime, and has a manufacturing 

procedure interchangeable with a conventional one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxide cathode 
such as a cathode ray tube or image pickup tube, and more particularly, to a 
novel oxide cathode for an electron tube having a long lifetime. For a conventional thermoelectron emitting cathode for an electron 
tube, there is an "oxide cathode" which includes an alkaline earth metal 
carbonate layer formed on a metal base containing Ni as a main component. 
Such an alkaline earth metal carbonate is converted into oxide during an 
evacuating process and is therefore termed an oxide cathode. An oxide 
cathode works at relatively low temperatures (700-800°C), since its work 
function is low. However, oxide cathodes have the problem of relatively short 
lifetimes. FIG.1 is a schematic sectional view illustrating a structure of a 
conventional oxide cathode. A conventional oxide cathode comprises a disk-shaped 
metal base 2, a cylindrical sleeve 3 supporting the metal base 2, a 
heater 4 for heating the cathode, and an electron emissive material layer 1 
which is formed on the metal base 2 and is made of an alkaline earth metal 
oxide as a main component. Such a conventional oxide cathode is 
manufactured by closing up one end of the cylindrical sleeve 3 with the metal 
base 2, inserting the heater 4 in the sleeve 3, and forming the electron  
 
emissive material layer 1 which is made of a mixture of at least two alkaline 
earth metal oxides on the surface of the metal base 2. The metal base 2 is located on the sleeve 3 and supports the electron 
emissive material layer 1. It is made of a refractory metal, such as nickel (Ni) 
or platinum (Pt), and contains a reducing element to facilitate the reduction of 
an alkaline earth metal oxide. As a reducing element is typically used a 
reducing metal, such as tungsten (W), magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si) or 
zirconium (Zr). The reducing metals are generally used in combination with 
each other. The sleeve 3, which supports the metal base 2 and has a heater 4 
therein, is typically made of a refractory metal, such as molybdenum (Mo), 
tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W) or stainless steel. The heater 4, which is located inside the sleeve 3, heats an electron 
emissive material layer 1 through the metal base 2. It is made of a tungsten 
wire coated with alumina et al. The electron emissive material layer 1, which emits thermoelectrons, is 
formed on the metal base 2 as an alkaline earth metal oxide layer. A 
suspension of a carbonate of an alkaline earth metal (Ba, Sr, Ca etc.) is 
sprayed on the metal base 2. After the
