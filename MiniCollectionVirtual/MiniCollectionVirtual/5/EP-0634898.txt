<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for packing bakery products such as sponge-cakes and similar products in a gas tight wrapper of foil material or the like, whereby the baked product first is cooled down before it is arranged within the wrapper. The method is characterized in that the cake immediately after leaving the oven is cooled down in an enclosure having an atmosphere of carbon dioxide or nitrogen at a temperature below 273 k.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for packing bakery 
products such as sponge-cakes and similar products in a gas 
tight wrapper of foil material or the like, whereby the baked 
product first is cooled down before it is arranged within the 
wrapper. Such a method is generally known. When the bakery product leaves the furnace it generally 
has a temperature of slightly more than 100 Â°C. The cells of 
the product are then essentially filled with carbon dioxide 
and water vapor. The carbon dioxide has been developed during 
the rising of the product. At the moment the hot cake is leaving the furnace the 
cake is essentially free of oxygen and of microorganisms, 
what would be an ideal situation for packaging. During the cooling down in the atmospheric air, however 
several effects occur, e.g.: The carbon dioxide and water vapor disappear partly from 
the product as a result of the differences between the concentration 
of water and carbon dioxide in the cake and the 
surrounding atmosphere. The atmosphere of the pores of the 
cake cells will due to diffusion after cooling down be replaced 
by an atmosphere corresponding to the composition of 
the surrounding air. Due to cooling down in atmosphere the pores of the cake 
will contain about 20 percent of oxygen and the cake itself 
will in most cases be contaminated with traces of bacteria or 
fungi. From the Dutch Patent Specification 176,131 it is known 
to cool down bakery product not in air but in vacuum. The 
above-mentioned effects will occur then partly. From for instance the European Patent Application A1-0,313,168 
it is known to cool down bakery products in an 
environment of carbon dioxide gas with the purpose to saturate 
the product with this gas. In practicizing this method 
the carbon dioxide, as is expressly stated, is not used as a 
coolant. Thus, carbon dioxide must be absorbed during the  
 
total cooling down of the product. The present invention has as one of its aims to speed up 
the time interval from taking out the cake from the furnace 
till the cake is placed in a package wrapper. Another purpose of the invention is to prolong the shelf 
live of the product. These objects are achieved in accordance with the invention 
with a method for packing bakery products such as 
sponge-cakes and similar products in a gas tight wrapper of 
foil material or the like, whereby the baked product first is 
cooled down before it is arranged within the wrapper. The 
method is characterized in that the cake immediately after 
leaving the oven is cooled
