<ABSTRACT>
A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism, which 
comprises a slider (50) provided to be movable along a barrel (2), a 

movable member (54;65) provided between a bullet holding chamber (4a) 
provided at the back of the barrel (2) and a pressure chamber (56;62) 

with variable capacity provided in the slider (50), and a gas passage 
controller (25) provided to be movable in the movable member (54;65), 

wherein the gas passage controller (25) is operative selectively to 
control a first gas passage (21) extending from a pressure accumulating 

chamber (33) through the movable member (54;65) to the bullet holding 
chamber (4a) to be open so that gas discharged from the pressure 

accumulating chamber (33) is supplied through the first gas passage 
(21) to the bullet holding chamber (4a) and to control a second gas 

passage (22) extending from the pressure accumulating chamber (33) 
through the movable member (54;65) to the pressure chamber (56;62) to be 

open so that gas discharged from the pressure accumulating chamber (33) 
is supplied through the second gas passage (22) to the pressure chamber 

(56;62) to cause each of the slider (50) and the movable member (54;65) 
to move back for making preparations for supplying the bullet holding 

chamber (4a) with a sham bullet (BB) from a magazine (31) for 
containing sham bullets.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a model gun with
automatic bullet supplying mechanism, and more particularly to an
improvement in a model gun having an automatic bullet supplying
mechanism which is operative to supply automatically a bullet holding
chamber provided just at the back of a barrel with a sham bullet which
is to be shot with gas pressure.A model gun which is often called an air soft gun is made to
imitate a real gun in not only its color and shape but also its
apparent operations. As for one of these model guns, which is made to
imitate a real gun having a slider provided to be able to move back and
forward along a barrel thereof in accordance with triggering action, it
has been proposed to make such an arrangement that gas pressure is used
for supplying a bullet holding chamber provided just at the back of a
barrel with a sham bullet and further for shooting the sham bullet put
in the bullet holding chamber, as shown in, for example, Japanese
utility model application published before examination under publication
number 3-38593. According to the arrangement thus proposed, a pressure
accumulating bomb in which compressed air is contained and which has an
air leading passage controlled to be open and closed selectively by an 
operation valve, a magazine for containing sham bullets, first and
second valves, first and second air passages and a bullet supplying
lever are provided in a grip, an air cylinder is positioned in a slider
which is provided to be able to move back and forward along a barrel to
be opposite to the rear end of the barrel with a magazine plate between,
and a rotary cam engaging with the magazine plate to move the same
upward and downward and a spring guide member which moves together with
the slider are further provided, so that each of the sham bullets
contained in the magazine is supplied to the inside of the barrel and
then shot through the barrel with the compressed air discharged from
the pressure accumulating bomb.In a model gun to which the above mentioned arrangement is
applied, when a trigger is pulled, the first valve is caused to operate
for permitting the compressed air discharged through the air leading
passage opened by the operation valve from the pressure accumulating
bomb to be introduced through the first air passage into the inside of
the air cylinder and a piston provided in the air cylinder is moved with
the pressure of the compressed air to cause the slider to move back.
The air cylinder is shifted into the air exhausting condition after

<CLAIMS>
A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism, which
comprises a magazine (31) for containing sham bullets (BB) provided in a

grip (6), a pressure accumulating chamber (33) provided in the grip (6)
for accumulating gas pressure, a bullet holding chamber (4a) provided at

the back of a barrel (2) to be close to one end of the magazine (31), a
slider (50) provided to be movable along the barrel (2), and a pressure

chamber (56;62) with variable capacity provided in the slider (50) to
be positioned at the back of the barrel (2), characterized in that a

movable member (54;65) is provided between the bullet holding chamber
(4a) and the pressure chamber (56;62), and in that a gas passage

controller (25) is provided to be movable in the movable member (54;65)
for controlling a first gas passage (37,36,38,23,21) extending from the

pressure accumulating chamber (33) through the movable member (54,65) to
the bullet holding chamber (4a) and a second gas passage (37,36,38,23,22) extending

from the pressure accumulating chamber (33) through the movable member
(54;65) to the pressure chamber (56;62) to be open or closed,

said gas passage controller (25) being operative
selectively first to control the first gas passage (37,36,38,23,21) to be open so that gas

discharged from the pressure accumulating chamber (33) is supplied
through the first gas passage (37,36,38,23,21) to the bullet holding chamber (4a)

and then to control the first gas passage (37,36,38,23,21) to be closed and keep the second gas passage (37,36,38,23,22) open so that gas
discharged from the pressure accumulating chamber (33) is supplied

through the second gas passage (37,36,38,23,22) to the pressure chamber (56;62) to
cause the slider (50) and the movable member (54;65) to move

back for making preparations for supplying the bullet holding chamber
(4a) with a sham bullet (BB) from the end of the magazine (31). 
A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism according
to claim 1, wherein said gas passage controller (25) comprises a movable

valve member (27) for controlling each of the first and second gas
passages (37,36,38,23,21;37,36,38,23,22) to be open and closed selectively.
A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism according
to claim 1, wherein each of the first and second gas passages (37,36,38,23,21;37,36,38,23,22) is

divided into sections so that the gas in the pressure chamber (56;62)
is exhausted through the second gas passage (37,36,38,23,22) divided into sections

and thereby the movable member (54;65) is moved back and the gas passage
controller (25) is operative to make preparations for supplying the

bullet holding chamber (4a) with the sham bullet (BB) from the end of
the magazine (31) when the slider (50) reaches to the rearmost position.
A model gun with automatic bullet supplying mechanism according
to claim 1 further comprising a spring member (18) provided in relation

to the slide (50) for charging elastic force when the slider (50) moves
back and causing each of the slider (50) and the movable member (54;65)

to be moved forward with the elastic force after the preparations for
supplying the bullet holding chamber (4a) with the sham bullet (BB) from

the end of the magazine (31) have been done, wherein said movable
member (54;65) moving forward is operative to carry the sham bullet

(BB) from the end of the magazine (31) to the bullet holding
chamber(4a).
