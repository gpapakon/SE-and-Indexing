<ABSTRACT>
A circuit for generating an output pulse Iout which is stabilised in length comprises a capacitor (C1) polarised by two completely independent voltages, the polarisation levels of which, fixed by a current generator via current mirrors (M3, M0; M11, M4, M1; M12, M5, M2 and M6; M8) are therefore very stable.

A circuit for generating a width-stabilised output pulse 
(Iout), of the type comprising a capacitor (C1) 

connected, firstly, to a charging circuit (M5, M2), and, 
secondly, to a discharging circuit (M9), the said 

charging and discharging circuits being controlled by an 
input pulse (Iin),
characterised in that t
he said generating circuit 
comprises a comparator (COMP) formed: 


by a first transistor (M10) biased by the said 
capacitor (C1), the capacitor being, firstly, 

discharged through the circuit (M9) for a first 
level of the input pulse (Iin), and, secondly, 

charged for a second level of the input pulse, 
through the charging circuit (M5, M2) under a fixed 

current (I1) supplied by a first current mirror (M2) 
of a current generator (GC). 
by a second transistor (M8), in series with the 
first transistor (M10), the said second transistor 

being, firstly, inhibited for the first level of the 
input pulse (Iin) and, secondly, biased for the 

second level of the input pulse, by a fixed bias 
defined by a current supplied by a second current 

mirror (M1) of the said current generator (GC), the 
said comparator (COMP) supplying an output signal 

having, for the second level of the input impulse 
(Iin), a variable level component, corresponding to 

the charge of the capacitor (C1), and the variations 
of which are defined by the intensity (I1) of the 

charging current of the capacitor (C1) and by the 
bias of the second transistor (M8), so that, the 

said output signal of the comparator (COMP) being 
applied to logic means (INV, NOR) for comparing the 

input pulse (Iin), the width of the output pulse is  
 

determined by the said intensity (I1) of the 
charging current of the capacitor (C1) and the said 

bias of the second transistor. 
A generating circuit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the said current generator (GC) is 
formed by a control transistor (M0) configured as a 

diode. 
A generating circuit according to one of Claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the said bias of the second 
transistor (M8) of the comparator (COMP) is a threshold 

voltage of a biasing transistor (M6) supplied by the 
current (I2) provided by the second current mirror (M1). 
A generating circuit according to any one of Claims 1 to 
3,
characterised in that
 the first and second current 
mirrors each comprise a transistor (M2, M1) biased by the 

said control transistor (MO).
