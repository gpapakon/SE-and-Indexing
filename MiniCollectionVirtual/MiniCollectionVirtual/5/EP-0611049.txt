<ABSTRACT>
A lubricant which comprises a polyether polyol 
which is a reaction product of 


i) one or more C₂₋₄-alkylene oxides and 
ii) a polyhydroxy compound selected from pentites, 
hexites, monosaccharides or disaccharides is used for 

lubricating an elastic fibrous material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
lubricating an elastic fibrous material and to an 
elastic fibrous material incorporating a lubricant. In the commercial production of yarns, such as 
continuous-filament yarns, it is common practice to 
apply lubricants to filaments to reduce the tendency 
towards breakage of the individual filaments when they 
are subjected to various mechanical strains. Excessive 
broken filaments result in a loss of yarn strength or 
even cause interruption of the manufacturing process. 
The lubricants are commonly applied during the 
spinning, twining, knitting or weaving process. Due to 
the ever-increasing processing speed sought by textile 
fiber manufacturers and processors, very efficient 
lubrication of the fibers is required to minimize fiber 
or yarn breakage. Various compositions have been 
suggested as textile lubricants. U.S. patent 3,341,452 discloses a high 
temperature lubricant composition for textile fibers 
comprising 40 to 60 weight parts of coconut oil, 5 to 
20 weight parts of a soft hydrocarbon-wax and 25 to 50 
weight parts of a nonionic emulsifier. The soft wax is 
of mineral oil origin. Disclosed as a non-ionic 
emulsifier is a condensate of 10 mols of ethylene oxide 
and 1 mol of nonylphenol and a mixed oleic/lauric acid 
ester of the condensate of 30 mols of ethylene oxide 
and 1 mol sorbitol. The lubricant composition is 
dispersed in water to form an aqueous emulsion which is 
then applied to textile yarns. It is said that the  
 
treated yarn has outstanding high-temperature 
processing properties. After the yarn has been processed in various 
steps to an article, such as cloth etc., the lubricant 
is usually removed from the article. Coconut oil and 
hydrocarbon-waxes are water-insoluble and can only be 
removed from the article with considerable effort. 
Furthermore, mineral oil is hardly biodegradable and 
contaminates water which is usually used for washing 
the article. U.S. patent 3,338,830 discloses a textile 
lubricant containing, on a weight basis, 50 to 80 parts 
of a polyoxyalkylene diol, a polyoxyalkylene monoether 
or a polyoxyalkylene monoester which contains 
oxyethylene groups and oxy-1,2-propylene groups in a 
ratio between 3:1 and 1:1 and has a molecular weight of 
at least about 5,000, 10 to 40 parts of an ester having 
a smoke point above 150°C and a viscosity at 25 °C 
between 25 and 400 poises, and 10 to 40 parts of an 
emulsifier. The U.S. patent discloses that the 
polyoxyalkylene preferably is a diol containing 
oxyet
