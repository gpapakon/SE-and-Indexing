<ABSTRACT>
Spring-hydraulic chain tensioner (K) with a cup-shaped housing (G), manufactured from reinforced plastic, for a spring-loaded and hydraulically pressurizable tensioning piston (B), with a steel running sleeve (H) which is fixed positively on the inner wall of the housing (G) and is formed in the housing as a steel tube produced beforehand without the need for finishing and then hardened. An embodiment of the subject-matter of the invention is illustrated by Figure 1 of the drawing.

<CLAIMS>
Spring hydraulic chain tensioner (K) having a pot-shaped 
housing (G) made from reinforced plastic for a 

spring-loaded and hydraulically loadable tension piston 
(B), having a steel sliding sleeve (H) fixed positively 

to the inner wall of the housing (G) and which is moulded 
into the housing as a prefabricated and hardened piece of 

steel pipe (21) which does not need reworking. 
Chain tensioner according to claim 1, having a 
displacement body (V) extending from the pot base (4) of 

the housing (G) in the direction towards the housing 
opening, characterised in that the housing (G) is 

designed to be integral with the displacement body (V) 
made from the reinforced plastic. 
Chain tensioner according to claims 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the housing (G) is an injection 

moulded plastic moulding. 
Chain tensioner according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the housing (G) consists of fibre-reinforced, 

preferably glass fibre-reinforced plastic, 
such as polyamide. 
Chain tensioner according to one of claims 1 to 3,
 
characterised in that the housing (G) consists of 

plastic, such as polyamide, reinforced by incorporated 
spherical particles, preferably glass balls.
