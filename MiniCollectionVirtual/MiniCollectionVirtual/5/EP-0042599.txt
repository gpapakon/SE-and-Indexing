<ABSTRACT>
A programme journal contains record carrier parts, which can be separated from the journal, particularly in strip shape. These contain in data blocks the data for the programme contributions printed in the programme journal, which are required for storage in a programming device for automatically operating a receiver in dependence on programme contributions selected by the user, and also a marking field for the individual programme selection and in each case an allocation identification which can be read by the user. This provides the possibility of a simple transmission of the mechanically readable data of the marked data into the programming device.
