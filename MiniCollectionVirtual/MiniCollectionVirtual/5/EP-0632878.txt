<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to heat
exchangers, and more particularly, to an improved heat
exchanger tube for use in oil coolers or radiators.
Typical heat exchangers are often employed to remove
excess heat produced during operation of engines. Such
heat exchangers often include a series of heat exchanger
tubes through which a hot fluid flows. The heat
exchanger tubes operate to reduce the temperature of the
hot fluid which is then recirculated back into the
engine.Such heat exchanger tubes often comprise a finned
section, hereinafter defined as that portion of a flow
tube having fin elements, as well as adapter portions
for insertion into a heat exchanger. Existing fin
elements are generally rectangular and are attached
along the flow tube. The heat from the hot fluid is
transferred via the heat exchanger tubes to the
surrounding atmosphere by the passing of air over the
exterior surface area of the heat exchanger tubes. The
fin elements increase surface area over which air may
flow to maximize heat removal. The fin elements may be
individual or they may take the form of corrugated fin
strips attached laterally along the flow tube. As the
surface area of the fin elements is increased, greater
heat transfer occurs between the heat exchanger tube and
its surroundings via the air flow, and therefore, a
greater cooling effect of the fluid is achieved.A problem encountered with existing heat exchanger
tubes is that the length of the fin elements positioned
laterally along the flow tube often exceed the diameter
of the flow tube thereby creating a gap which tends to
collect debris deposited by the flowing of air. Debris
also collects on, and in between, the rectangular fin
elements themselves, especially when corrugated fin 
strips are used. The build up of debris often
interferes with the transfer of heat from the heat
exchanger tube to the surroundings resulting in
inefficient cooling of the fluid. A heat exchanger tube
is therefore desirable which minimizes build up of such
debris resulting in more efficient heat transfer and
easier cleaning and maintenance of the heat exchanger.US-A-4,171,015 (over which claim 1 is
characterised), GB-A-864,946 and DE-C-886,919 disclose
known examples of heat exchanger tubes.According to the present invention, there is
provided a heat exchanger tube comprising, a
substantially oblong flow tube having a lateral axis
transverse to the length of the flow tube along which
the dimension of the flow tube in cross-section is at a
maximum, the flow tube being provided with

provided with two sets fin elements (32) positioned
laterally along opposite sides of the flow tube, each of

the fin elements being of uniform thickness and having a
