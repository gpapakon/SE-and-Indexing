<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to louse repellent compositions.US 2 400 006 describes the use of ortho and para
alkoxyphenylalkyl alcohols of specified structure as repellent for
Trombiculidae, Aedes aegypti, Aedes taeniorhynchus and Anopheles
quadrimaculatus.We have surprisingly found that a range of methoxy aromatic
compounds have louse repellent and pediculicidal properties.According to the invention there is provided the use of a
compound of general formula I in the manufacture of a medicament having
pediculicidal or louse repellent properties.

   A is -CH2OR, -CHO, -CC2R1
wherein
   R is H, C1 to C5 alkyl or

and
   R1 is H or C1 to C3 alkylThe para isomer is often somewhat preferred on cost grounds
but ortho and meta isomers are both usable.Some of the compounds such as p-anisaldehyde have 
agreeable odours and may be preferred.Preferred compounds of the invention include 4-methoxybenzaldehyde
(II), 4-methoxybenzoic acid (III), 4-methoxybenzyl
alcohol (IV) and p-anisyl p-anisicate (V)
At least some of the compounds are readily
available commercially. Those skilled in the art will
readily be able to obtain others.The active ingredient is conveniently applied
directly to the hair. Those skilled will readily be able
to devise vehicles for doing this. Convenient forms
include lotions gels and mousses which may be prepared in 
a manner familiar to those skilled in the art.Preferably the compounds are presented in
alcoholic solution. The alcohol may be ethanol, propanol
especially isopropanol, other alcohols or mixtures
thereof. Preferably aqueous alcohol is used to reduce
the possibility of skin irritation.The efficiency of the composition may be enhanced
by ensuring that it has a tendency to coat the hair. This
can be achieved by incorporating spreading film formers
such as silicones, soluble lanolin or soluble polymers
such as PVP optionally copolymerised with vinyl acetate.Many of the compounds of the invention are solid
at room temperature and may have a tendency to
crystallise from alcohol solution at low temperature eg
about 0°C. The crystals may block the dispenser. This
problem can be substantially reduced by incorporating an
emulsifier.Preferably two emulsifiers are employed. A, the
or each emulsifier may be an nonionic emulsifier such as
alkoxylated fatty alcohol or fatty acid. The emulsifier
keeps the active ingredient in solution and deters
crystallisation. Where two emulsifiers are used the
solubilisation appears to be increased synergistically. 
Where emulsifier is present the active ingredient
