Method for launching and controlling at a target (4), from a moving vehicle (1), 
at least one non-vertically guided projectile (2,3) with a mixed trajectory (25), 

with a free portion, with an adjustable duration (TB1), then with a braked 
trajectory (TB2), in which, in an initial approach phase before the launch, and for 

each of the various sucessive positions of the vehicle (1), 

1. The position of the target (4) is determined in a three dimensional reference 

linked to the vehicle (1). 
2. The said adjustable duration is fixed at a maximum value and the virtual 
anticipated trajectory of the projectile (2,3) and the maximum range are 

calculated taking into account the speed of the vehicle (1) and the said references. 
3. The distance from the target (4) to the said virtual anticipated trajectory (6) 
having a maximum range is calculated and, 
 
The projectile (2,3) is launched after the said distance is exceeded by a minimum,
 
characterised in that
 
in a second approach phase, the position 
of
 the target (4) is determined, an 
anticipated virtual trajectory of the projectile (2,3) is calculated as for the initial 

approach phase, but by replacing, in the calculation, the minimum distance having 
being exceeded, the maximum range (6) of the trajectory with a mixed trajectory 

(25) whose travelling duration (TB1) of the portion of the free trajectory (26) is 
subject to the minimum of the said distance of the target (4) so that, for each of 

the various positions of the vehicle (1) during this second approach phase, the 
distance from the target (4) to the trajectory of the projectile (25) is equal to this 

minimum and, before the said travelling duration expires (TB1, TB2), a travelling 
duration for the free trajectory portion (26) is transmitted to the projectile (2,3). 
Procedure according to claim 1, in which the angle of impact (A) at the base of 
the trajectory of the projectile (2,3) is calculated during the initial phase (6) as 

well as during the second approach phase (25) and the launch is banned until a 
projectile trajectory (25) has, with the horizontal, an angle of impact (A) greater 

than a determined value (AO). 
Procedure according to one of claims 1 and 2 in which, several projectiles (2,3) 
are launched giving them respectively several points of impacts (4) on the target 

and a duration of the free trajectory portion (TB1,TB2) is transmitted to each 
projectile (2,3) depending on the position of the corresponding point of impact 

(4).  
 
Procedure according to one of claims 1 to 3, in which the said travelling 
duration (TB1 TB2) is compared to a threshold value and a signal to ban the 

launch of the projectile is brought about (2,3) when it is less than the said 
threshold value. 
Guiding procedure after the launch according to the procedure in one of claims 
1 to 4, in which, to prevent the passage of the projectile (2,3) in a space to be 

avoided, 

the position of the space is determined 
the distance is calculated between a summit of the space and the mixed 
trajectory (25) and, 
the projectile (2,3) is only launched after the said distance is exceeded by a 
minimum. 
Guiding procedure after the launch according to the procedure in one of claims 
1 to 5, in which, the projectile (2,3) comprises a receiver for data equipped to 

cooperate, following the launch, with an emitter of the vehicle (1), a calculation is 
made after the launch of a virtual trajectory (6;25) of the projectile (2,3) 

coinciding with its actual trajectory and signals which correspond to the travelling 
duration of the portion of the free trajectory (26) are sent to the projectile (2,3).
