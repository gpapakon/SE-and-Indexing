<ABSTRACT>
A method of identifying an object and determining in which of at least 
two areas the object is located is disclosed. The method includes the steps of: 

focusing a first directional antenna (
18
) on a first area (
28a
), focusing a 
second directional antenna on a second area (
28b
), transmitting a first field 
strength pulse (
44
) from said first directional antenna (
18
), transmitting a 
second field strength pulse (
46
) from said second directional antenna (
18
), 
and comparing in a transponder (
14
) the first field strength pulse (
44
) to the 
second field strength pulse (
46
) to determine in which of the two areas 
(
28a
,
28b
) the transponder (
14
) is located. Other devices, systems and 
methods are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to a transponder arrangement in
which an interrogator or reader unit communicates with a remote tag or
transponder. Particularly,
this invention relates to a vehicle identification
system as defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 1 and to a
method as defined in the precharacterizing portion of claim 12.A vehicle identification system of the type mentioned above
is known from EP-A-0 401 192. The interrogators are mounted
for overhead or side detection, each interrogator covering
one traffic lane. The transponder is mounted on a vehicle.
One interrogator may communicate with more than one
transponder simultaneously present in its field of view
using randomized time division multiplexing. To ensure good
coverage even if lane disciplines are not complied with, two
interrogators may be provided for each lane, wherein
adjacent interrogators have partially overlapping fields of
view and are activated alternately during each
interrogation cycle.The article "Automatic Vehicle Identification on Busy
Multilane City Roads" by M. A. Do et al. in Vehicle
Navigation & Information Systems Conference Proceedings
1991, IEEE US, discloses an Automatic Vehicle Identification
(AVI) system which employs a single beam antenna to cover
the whole width of a multi-lane road over several car
lengths. To avoid collision of replying signals, these
replies are separated in time domain, instead of by the
locations of the vehicles in the road, using randomized time
division multiplexing which is carried out by the
identification tag attached to the vehicle. The roadside
equiment includes a station computer, a signal processor, a
microwave transceiver and a wide beam antenna.The article "IVHS Applications of Smart Cards" by Mark R.,
Komanecky and David M. Claus in Vehicle Navigation &
Information Systems Conference Proceedings 1991, IEEE US,
describes using smart cards in an Electronic Toll &
Traffic Management system with Automatic Vehicle
Identification (AVI) for automated payment of tolls via a
two-way RF link between a toll plaza and an in-vehicle unit
which contains the card. The roadside equipment comprises
one pre-plaza interrogation unit, which is located 100 to
1000 meters before the toll plaza and which is continuously
polling to awaken the in-vehicle unit, and two toll lane
interrogation units, which are located within the toll lanes
for communication with the in-vehicle unit and which the
vehicle passes successively.In automatic toll booth systems
