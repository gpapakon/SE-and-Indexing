<DESCRIPTION>
The invention described and claimed herein relates to 
the design and use of nucleic acid probes capable of 
detecting organisms of the genus Ureaplasma, and known 
strains or serotypes of the species Ureaplasma 
urealyticum, in test samples, e.g., from urogenital and 
endocervical specimens, tissue samples, amniotic and other 
body fluids, and from cultures. Two single strands of deoxyribo- ("DNA") or ribo- 
("RNA") nucleic acid, formed from nucleotides, (including 
the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), thymidine (T), 
guanine (G), uracil (U), or inosine (I)), may hybridize to 
form a double-stranded structure held together by hydrogen 
bonds between pairs of complementary bases. Generally, A 
is hydrogen bonded to T or U, while G or I are hydrogen 
bonded to C. Along the chain, classical base pairs AT or 
AU, TA or UA, GC, or CG are present. Additionally, some 
mismatched base pairs (e.g., AG, GU) may be present. Bringing together two single strands of nucleic acid 
containing sufficient contiguous complementary bases, 
under conditions which will promote their hybridization, 
results in double-stranded nucleic acid. Under 
appropriate conditions, DNA/DNA, RNA/DNA, or RNA/RNA 
hybrids can form. A probe is generally a single-stranded nucleic acid 
sequence complementary to some degree to a nucleic acid  
 
sequence sought to be detected ("target sequence"). A 
probe may be labeled with a reporter group moiety such as 
a radioisotope, a fluorescent or chemiluminescent moiety, 
or with an enzyme or other ligand which can be used for 
detection. Background descriptions of the use of nucleic 
acid hybridization to detect particular nucleic acid 
sequences are given in Kohne, U.S. Patent No. 4,851,330 
issued July 25, 1989, and by Hogan et al., International 
Patent Application No. PCT/US87/03009, entitled "Nucleic 
Acid Probes for Detection and/or Quantitation of Non-Viral 
Organisms," both references hereby incorporated by 
reference herein. Hogan et al., supra, describe methods 
for determining the presence of a non-viral organism or a 
group of non-viral organisms in a sample (e.g., sputum, 
urine, blood and tissue sections, food, soil and water). The genera Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma are prokaryotes 
and comprise the taxonomic Mollicutes class. Mollicutes 
lack a bacterial cell wall and have a small genome size. 
They are considered one of the smallest of the free-living 
microorganisms. Ureaplasma are unique among Mollicutes 
because of their characteristic ability to metabolize 
urea. There are
