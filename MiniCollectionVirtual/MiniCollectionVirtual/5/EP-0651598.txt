<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electronic circuit module having a printed circuit board (1) with an electrically insulating layer (2), which has a first metal layer in order to form conductor tracks and in order to support surface-mounted components (surface-mounted devices, SMDs). In order to reduce the space requirement for the electronic circuit module, it is proposed that the printed circuit board (1) have at least one bent edge on which the electrically insulating layer has a depression and around which a section of the printed circuit board is curved.
