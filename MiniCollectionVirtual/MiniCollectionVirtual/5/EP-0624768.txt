<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus has a container (3), in the inner space (11) of which an essentially funnel-shaped wall (12) coaxial to the container axis (4) is arranged. The wall (12) has a top, conical section (13) tapering towards the bottom. A cylindrical wall section (14) adjoins the wall section (13). In addition, a shaft (15) coaxial to the container axis (4) leads through the sectional space (11a) defined by the funnel-shaped wall (12). In this arrangement, the bottom section (15a) of the shaft (15) is provided with a conveying member, namely a worm helix (16), and the top section (15b) of the shaft (15) is provided with mixing members (17). To mix the stock, the shaft (15) is rotated about the container axis (4) so that a portion of the stock to be mixed is continuously drawn off from the bottom area of the outer sectional space (11b) and conveyed through the cylindrical wall section (14) into the conical wall section (13), is agitated and mixed in the latter by the mixing members (17), and is then conveyed back again into the outer sectional space (11b). With the apparatus according to the invention, substances which are added during the mixing operation to stock predetermined in the container (3) are already uniformly distributed in the predetermined stock during the feeding.

Apparatus for the batchwise mixing and/or drying of a
material, having


a container (3) with a vertical axis,
a top material inlet (8), which opens out into the
interior of the container (3), and a bottom material

outlet (9), which leads out of the container interior,
a funnel-shaped wall (12) which is arranged coaxially
to the container axis (4), in the interior of the

container (3), and has a conically downwardly
tapering, top wall section (13) and a cylindrical,

bottom wall section (14) adjoining the top wall
section, and
a conveying element which is routed through the
cylindrical wall section (14),

characterized in that at least one rotatable mixing element
(17) is arranged within the conical wall section (13), in

that there is a shaft (15) which is coaxial with the
container axis, in that the conveying element and the at

least one mixing element (17) are arranged on said shaft
(15), and in that the outlet (9), which is arranged at the

bottom end of the container (3), has an outlet element (10)
which can be optionally shut off, it also being possible for

the shaft (15) to be rotated about the container axis (4)
during removal of the mixed material, and the shaft, for this

purpose, remaining mounted on the outlet element (10), with
the result that the mixed material can run out uniformly and

in its entirety.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the shaft (15) is routed through the two wall sections (13,

14), which form the funnel-shaped wall (12). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the two ends of the shaft (15), routed through the inner

part-chamber (lla), are mounted in a rotatable manner.
Apparatus according to Claim 2 or 3, characterized in
that the conveying element is formed by a screw helix (16).
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in that,
at least on its end section which projects out of the

cylindrical wall section (14, 114), the conveying element has
a second screw helix (117), which is arranged in an axially

symmetrical manner in relation to the first-mentioned screw
helix (16, 116).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the container (3) has a cylindrical

wall (5) which is adjoined at the bottom end by a conical,
downwardly tapering wall part (6).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that the length of the essentially

funnel-shaped wall (12, 112) is such that the funnel-shaped
wall (12, 112) extends over more or less 3/4 to 2/3 of the

height of the interior (11).
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the cylindrical wall section (114) of

the funnel-shaped wall (112) comprises a first and a second
half-shell (114a, 114b), the first half-shell (114a) being

connected fixedly to the conical wall section (113), and the
second half-shell (114b) being arranged on the first

half-shell (114a) such that it can be pivoted by rotary and
closure means (118, 119) arranged on it and on the first

half-shell (114a).
