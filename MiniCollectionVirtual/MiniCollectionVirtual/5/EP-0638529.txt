<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a precursor which can be 
used in the production of a high performance amorphous carbon 
molded article, a process for molding the precursor, a resin 
molding material used in the molding of the precursor, and a 
process for producing an amorphous carbon molded article from 
the precursor. Amorphous carbon molded articles are widely used, for 
example, as crucibles or Raschig rings in the fields of 
metallurgical and chemical industries for their 
impermeability and chemical stability, and as plasma etchers, 
susceptors, or substrates of electronic parts in the 
electronic industry for their high purity and excellent 
electrical characteristics. Amorphous carbon molded articles are usually obtained 
by burning into carbonization of a precursor of amorphous 
carbon molded articles (hereinafter simply referred to as a 
precursor) which comprises a non-thermoplastic polymer, such 
as cellulose, or a thermosetting resin, such as a phenolic 
resin or a furan resin. Of these resin materials for preparing a precursor, 
phenolic resins have been used most often because they are  
 
easy to carbonize, exhibit high efficiency in burning, and 
provide high performance carbon moldings. A precursor comprising a phenolic resin is generally 
produced by a composite thermosetting resin molding method, 
in which a liquid phenolic resin combined with a reinforcing 
material or a filler, such as paper, cloth, glass fiber or an 
inorganic filler, is molded and heated to cure. However, the 
amorphous carbon molded article obtained by burning the thus 
prepared precursor in vacuo or in an inert gas atmosphere 
unavoidably contains voids and has poor adhesion on the 
interface between amorphous carbon (a thermal decomposition 
product of the phenolic resin) and the reinforcing material 
or filler. Thus, this conventional method cannot be expected 
to provide an amorphous carbon molded article with excellent 
characteristics and has not been utilized for the production 
of high performance carbon moldings. In recent years, a new method of molding a phenolic 
resin has arisen, in which a particulate phenolic resin 
molding material having thermal plasticity is molded under a 
highly flowing state by transfer molding, injection molding, 
injection compression molding or extrusion as well as 
conventionally employed compression molding (hot press 
molding), as disclosed, e.g., in JP-B-53-43191 (the term 
"JP-B" as used herein means an "examined Japanese patent 
publication").
