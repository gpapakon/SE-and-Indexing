<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for a scanning-head printer (20) 
in which a single motor (118) is used to provide movement 

to a print head carriage (120) and to advance the paper 
(128) along a paper path. The single motor is coupled to 

the print head carriage to provide movement of the carriage 
back and forth across the width of the paper. As 

the carriage is moved across the paper, the print head 
(126) applies print to the paper. An advancement mechanism 

(64, 78, 144) is located near the edge of the paper 
path. As the print head carriage reaches the edge of the 

paper, the carriage contacts the advancement mechanism 
which, in turn, causes the paper to be advanced along the 

paper path. Thus, a single motor advances the paper and 
moves the carriage across the paper.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
scanning-head printers, and more particularly to the
movement of the print head and the advancement of the
paper in scanning-head printers.Scanning-head printers typically maintain a
print head within a movable carriage. A paper drive is
used to deliver paper to a position next to the carriage.
The carriage is repeatedly moved back and forth, or
"scanned", across the surface of the paper, with the
print head applying print to the paper. After each pass
of the carriage across the surface of the paper, the
paper drive advances the paper to present a new region,
or line, of the paper to the print head.Conventional scanning-head printers use multiple
motors to accomplish the printing process, since
there is an inherent incompatibility of moving parts with
respect to both the direction and timing of the movement.
For example, a first motor provides a periodic, linear
motion to the paper drive components for paper advancement,
while a separate second motor is used to provide a
substantially continuous, reciprocating motion to the
carriage, with the reciprocating motion of the carriage
being perpendicular to the direction of paper advancement.The use of multiple motors achieves a cooperation
of components for operating the printer, but increases
the size, mass, and cost of the printer. Each
motor requires electrical controls and gears to insure
that the carriage or paper is moved an appropriate distance.
These motors, controls, and gears add to the
size, the mass, and the cost of the printer. Additionally,
the housing of the printer must be sufficiently 
large to accommodate the above-mentioned components.
Furthermore, because power must be supplied to multiple
motors and electrical controls, power consumption is also
increased in multiple motor scanning-head printers.The drawbacks associated with scanning-head
printers are especially problematic in the field of portable
scanning-head printers, which ideally are in as compact
a form as possible in order to enhance mobility. As
with the size, it is desired to minimize the mass or
weight of a portable printer. Multiple motors, electrical
controls and gears, however, increase the size and
weight of the printer.Additionally, portable printers often function
using finite power sources, such as batteries. Therefore,
it is further desired to keep the power consumption
of the printer at a minimum. The use of multiple motors
and electrical controls, however, tends to guickly deplete
limited power supplies.Therefore it is an

A scanning-head printer (20) comprising:

a paper feed path;
a carriage (120) movable in a direction perpendicular to said paper feed
path between a first extreme position and a second extreme position of carriage

travel;
a printhead (126) connected to said carriage for travel therewith;
a motor (118) connected to drive said carriage; means responsive to
movement of the carriage in the end region of the first extreme position to

produce displacement of a slidable member (64) substantially in the direction
parallel to the paper feed path; and
means for advancing paper along said paper feed path in response to
displacement (114) of said slidable member;

characterised in that said means responsive to carriage movement

   comprises a hinge (78) having a fixed first end (94) and a displaceable second
end (96), said hinge having a pivot axis (90) between said first and second ends,

said pivot axis being displaceable substantially in the direction of movement of
the carriage, and said hinge having a first disposition in which said hinge extends

into the path of said carriage in said end region such that movement of said
carriage in said end region displaces said pivot axis and causes said hinge to

pivot to a second disposition in which the hinge is straighter than in its first
disposition and to displace said slidable member.
The printer of claim 1, wherein said hinge (78) comprises a first bar
element (80, 82) and a second bar element (84), the first bar element extending

between said first end (94) and said pivot axis (90), the second bar element
extending between said second end (96) and said pivot axis, and the first and

second bar elements being rotatably interconnected at said pivot axis. 
The printer of claim 1 or 2, wherein said means for advancing paper
includes a ratchet wheel (114) operatively associated with said slidable member

(64) to be rotated upon displacement of said slidable member.
The printer of claim 3, wherein said ratchet wheel (114) and said slidable
member (64) are connected by means of a tab (76) secured to said slidable

member.
The printer of any of claims 1 to 4 and further comprising means (34,100)
for limiting the extent of pivot of said hinge.
The printer of claim 4 comprising means (100) for biassing said hinge (78)
into its rest position when said carriage (120) is not in said end region.
The printer of any preceding claim, further comprising a second paper
advancement assembly for advancing the paper along said paper feed path when

said carriage (120) is in the end region of the second extreme position, said
second paper advancement assembly including a second hinge (78) and a second

slidable member.
