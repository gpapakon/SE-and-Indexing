<ABSTRACT>
A system for treating effluents such as sewage includes a mixing chamber and a separation chamber. In the mixing chamber various chemical additives are introduced into the effluent and thoroughly mixed to act as a flocculent to extract the solid materials in the separating chamber. In the separating chamber the mixed materials are caused to flow longitudinally in a laminar flow condition to allow stratification of the liquid from the solid materials. In the mixing chamber there is provided a plurality of transverse baffles spaced longitudinally and rotated angularly relatively to a longitudinal axis of the tube. Each baffle has tapered holes to act as a venturi to mix the materials. In the separation chamber there is provided an auger flight rotating slowly which has holes through the flight thus generating a laminar flow to provide improved separation of the solid and the liquid components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for treatment of effluent of the
type in which treatment chemicals are added to the effluent in a mixing chamber, the
chemicals being of a type which acts to flocculate the solid contaminants following
which the mixed effluent and chemicals are applied to a separating chamber which acts
to stratify or separate the flocculated solids from the clear liquid.At present treatment of effluent for example household sewage is either
carried out centrally in a large capacity effluent plant generally run by a government
organization or alternatively such effluent is treated by a conventional septic tank
arrangement in which natural bacterial action is used to separate solids from an effluent
liquid which is then dumped into a septic field.Various attempts have been made over many years to generate a septic
or effluent treatment system which is of a size suitable to be used in a relatively small
location for example one household or a group of households or by for example a
relatively small industrial process in which clear liquid basically suitable for human
consumption can be extracted from the effluent or sewage leaving solids in sludge form
which can be disposed of separately.While the treatment chemicals have been available for many years which
act as flocculents, up till now no suitable apparatus has been available which provides
the necessary mixing chamber and the subsequent separating chamber in an efficient
and effective manner at a cost of the apparatus which enables it to be supplied
economically for individual use such as that described above.Examples of apparatus proposed for this process are shown in U.S.
Patent 3,886,073 and U.S. Patent 4,710,290, both by Raymond P. Briltz. However
the apparatus shown in these patents are relatively complicated and expensive to 
manufacture and has accordingly achieved little success.One object of the present invention, therefore, to provide an improved
apparatus for treatment of effluent.According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided apparatus
for treating effluent comprising a mixing chamber having an effluent inlet, at least one
inlet for treatment chemicals and an outlet arranged such that the effluent enters at the
effluent inlet and moves through the chamber to the outlet and is mixed in the chamber
with the treatment chemicals, and a separating chamber having an inlet, a clear liquid
outlet and a sludge outlet, means for communicating the effluent from the mixing
chamber outlet to the separating chamber

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for treating effluent comprising a mixing
chamber having an effluent i
nlet, at least one inlet for treatment chemicals
and an outlet arranged such that the effluent enters at the effluent inlet and

moves through the chamber to the outlet and is mixed in the chamber with
the treatment chemicals, and a separating chamber having an inlet, a clear

liquid outlet and a sludge outlet, means for communicating the effluent from
the mixing chamber outlet to the separating chamber inlet such that the

effluent passes through the separating chamber and separates into clear
liquid and sludge for extraction separately at said clear liquid outlet and said

sludge outlet respectively, characterized in that the mixing chamber
comprises an elongate channel having a plurality of stationary baffles

extending across the channel, the baffles having holes therethrough through
which the effluent passes, at least some of the holes being tapered from an

inlet end to an outlet end to define a venturi effect in the effluent passing
therethrough.
The apparatus according to Claim 1 wherein each
baffle extends across a part only of the cross sectional area of the channel,

each baffle being longitudinally spaced from the next adjacent baffle and
being angularly offset relative to the next adjacent baffle.
The apparatus according to Claim 2 wherein the
channel is cylindrical having a circular cross section, each baffle comprising

a plate member defining a sector of the circular cross section which is less
than 50% thereof with a straight line forming one edge of the sector shape

defined by the plate of one baffle being angularly offset from that of the
next adjacent baffle. 
The apparatus according to Claim 3 wherein the
lines are offset by 120°.
The apparatus according to Claim 1, 2, 3 or 4
wherein the taper of the holes is of the order of 10°.
The apparatus according to Claim 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5
wherein the separating chamber comprises an elongate duct having said

inlet at one end of the duct and said clear liquid outlet and said sludge outlet
at an opposed end of the duct, said clear liquid outlet being arranged at an

upper part of said opposed end and said sludge outlet being arranged at a
lower part of said opposed end, and means moveable in the duct to apply

longitudinal movement to the sludge and the liquid in the duct tending to
move the sludge and the liquid longitudinally of the duct toward said

opposed end, said moveable means being arranged to generate a
substantially laminar flow of the sludge and the liquid for stratification

thereof in the duct.
The apparatus according to any one of Claims 1 to
5 wherein the separating chamber comprises an elongate duct having said

inlet at one end of the duct and said clear liquid outlet and said sludge outlet
at an opposed end of the duct, said clear liquid outlet being arranged at an

upper part of said opposed end and said sludge outlet being arranged at a
lower part of said opposed end, an auger flight mounted within the duct and

rotatable about an longitudinal axis of the duct, the flight having a cross
section substantially filling the cross section of the duct and having a

plurality of holes therein, the flight tending to move the sludge and liquid
toward said opposed end for stratification thereof in the duct.
The apparatus according to Claim 6 or 7 wherein
the duct is substantially horizontal and wherein the clear liquid outlet 

comprises a substantially vertical duct portion coupled to said duct at said
opposed end and extending upwardly therefrom and wherein said sludge

outlet comprises a substantially vertical duct portion coupled to said duct at
said opposed end and extending downwardly therefrom.
The apparatus according to Claim 6, 7 or 8

The apparatus according to Claim 9 wherein the
outlet header comprises a transverse duct, wherein the clear fluid outlet

vertical duct portion extending downwardly from said transverse duct and
wherein is provided an auger flight in the transverse duct tending to move
