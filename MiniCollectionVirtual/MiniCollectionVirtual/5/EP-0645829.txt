An AlGaAs chip 10 which has an n-type layer 11 and a p-type 
layer 12 is immersed in an aqueous solution containing 0.2-0.6 

wt% of ammonia and 25-35 wt% of hydrogen peroxide to form a 
primary protective layer 20, and after drying the AlGaAs chip 

10, the AlGaAs chip 10 is for a second time immersed in an 
aqueous solution containing 0.2-0.6 wt% of ammonia and 25-35 

wt% of hydrogen peroxide to form a secondary protective layer

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims the priority of Japanese Patent
Application No. 5-261903 filed on September 24, 1993.This invention relates to a method of manufacturing a light
emitting device, and more precisely to a method of manufacturing
a light emitting device wherein deterioration of brightness
is effectively prevented by forming a protective layer on the
AlGaAs chip surface.A light emitting device generally comprises an n-electrode
and a p-electrode provided on a compound semiconductor chip
which has a pn junction, and the chip is molded entirely with
epoxy resin. Figure 4 shows an example of the structure of a
conventional light emitting device. In this light emitting
device, an AlGaAs chip 10 which comprises an n-type layer 11 
and a p-type layer 12 has an n-electrode 13 on the n-type layer
side and a p-electrode 14 on the p-type layer side, and the
chip 10 is fixed to a base 16 by silver paste and such. The
chip 10 is sealed entirely with epoxy resin mold 15.In general, epoxy resin is hygroscopic and is poor in an
effect of moisture prevention. Therefore, under high humidity,
moisture in the air penetrates into the epoxy resin mold 15 and
reacts with AlGaAs, particularly when an electric current flows
in the light emitting device during operation, changing in
quality of the surface. As shown in Figure 5, an opaque
altered layer 17 is generated on the top surface and the side
surfaces of the n-type layer 11. When this opaque altered
layer 17 is generated, the light extraction efficiency decreases
and hence the brightness of the light emitting device
decreases.Because of this, a method has been proposed in which a
translucent protective layer 18 primarily composed of aluminum
oxide is formed on the top surface and the side surfaces of the
AlGaAs chip 10 (the 42nd Japan Society of Applied Physics and
Related Societies, pp 600, 9a-D-3, 1981, and the 44th Japan
Society of Applied Physics and Related Societies, pp 485,
28a-H-3, 1983).This method utilizes the fact that an aqueous solution
containing ammonia and hydrogen peroxide reacts with AlGaAs 
mixed crystals to form an aluminum oxide coating layer. That
is, the AlGaAs chip 10 is immersed in said ammonia-hydrogen
peroxide aqueous solution to form a protective layer 18
primarily composed of aluminum oxide on the light extracting
surface (hereafter referred to as the "upper surface") and the
side surfaces so that the AlGaAs chip 10 is protected from the
penetrating moisture. The thickness of this protective layer
18 is preferably 100 nm or more.Also,
