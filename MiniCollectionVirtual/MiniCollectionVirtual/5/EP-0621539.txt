<ABSTRACT>
Burst SRAMs designed for operation at a given data 
rate corresponding to the frequency of a first clock 

signal but capable of operation using a higher 
frequency clock signal. The burst SRAMs are preferably 

incorporated into the cache memory of a second level 
cache coupled to the processor bus in a computer 

system, where the computer system is preferably based 
on a 66-MHz P5 microprocessor. A cache controller, 

preferably incorporated within a memory controller, 
controls operation of the second level cache memory by 

providing the address load and address advance signals. 
The burst SRAMs are capable of recognizing the faster 

clock pulses, as well as the shorter pulses asserted on 
the address load and address advance signals. The 

address control signals are asserted and then negated 
during consecutive clock cycles of the faster clock 

signal, so that the burst SRAMs effectively operate at 
the same data rate corresponding to the lower frequency 

clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to burst SRAMs
designed to operate at a given data rate corresponding
to a first clock signal on a second, faster clock
signal.The consumers constantly demand faster and more
powerful computers from the computer industry. A major
bottleneck in computer speed has historically been the
speed with which data can be accessed from memory,
where this speed is referred to as the memory access
time. The microprocessor, with its relatively fast
processor cycle times, has generally had to wait during
memory accesses to account for the relatively slow
memory devices. Therefore, improvement in memory
access times has been one of the major areas of
research in enhancing computer performance.In order to bridge the gap between fast processor
cycle times and slow memory access times, cache memory
was developed. A cache is a small amount of very fast,
expensive, preferably zero wait state memory that is
used to store a copy of frequently accessed code and
data from system memory. The microprocessor can
operate out of this very fast memory and thereby reduce
the number of wait states that must be interposed
during memory accesses.The i486 microprocessor by the Intel Corporation
(Intel) uses a 32-bit data path and includes a version
which operates with 33 or 50 MHz clocks. The C5 or 
cache controller and compatible C8 or 82490 cache
static random access memories (SRAMs) are designed for
use with the i486 microprocessor to provide a
relatively high performance microprocessor/cache system
operating at 33 or 50 MHz. Another memory chip
compatible with the i486 microprocessor is the
MCM62486A 32k X 9 BurstRAM synchronous SRAM from
Motorola, Inc., which is designed for use in a
burstable, high performance, secondary level cache for
the i486 microprocessor. This particular burst SRAM
was designed to operate with a 33 MHz clock.The P5 or Pentium microprocessor from Intel is a
next generation microprocessor offering very high
performance features, including superscaler
architecture and integrated and separate code and data
caches. One version of the P5 operates at a clock
speed of 66 MHz and uses a full 64-bit data path,
thereby providing significant performance improvements
over the 32-bit, 33 MHz i486 microprocessor. Intel
provides a C5C cache controller with corresponding C8C
SRAMs, which provides an optimal second level cache
system for use with the P5 microprocessor. The C5C
cache controller and C8C SRAMs, however, are very
costly. Furthermore, other design considerations and
limitations

signal, the memory system operating with a second,
higher frequency clock signal, comprising:


a bus;
a burst SRAM (B) coupled to said bus, comprising:

a memory array (34) for receiving and
providing data at the predetermined data rate; and

detecting means and said burst SRAM (B) for asserting said

address advance signal (ADV*) during clock edges of the second
clock signal corresponding to the predetermined data

rate, and negating said address advance signal (ADV*)
otherwise.
