<ABSTRACT>
Various systems for attaching flexible fabric 
material (14) to rigid vanes (12) in the construction of window 

coverings are disclosed. The various systems for attaching 
the fabric material to the vanes create varying aesthetic 

patterns while providing long-term durability. The systems 
described can be used to connect single or double sheets of 

fabric material to the faces of rigid vanes while enabling 
the vanes to be oriented vertically or horizontally.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to window
shades.US-A-4450027 discloses cellular window
coverings which may be made of fabric or film
materials. A flexible strip of material is folded
into a continuous longitudinal tube and the
longitudinal folds thus created are permanently
set by passing the tube around a heat setting
wheel. Adhesive is applied along one side of the
flattened tubular material which is subsequently
stacked by winding onto a rack having flat
surfaces. The winding in this manner presses the
adhesive to the next layer wound onto the rack to
form a bonded unitary stack of closed tubular
cells. When the ends are cut from the rack, the
stack may be expanded and the permanently set
creases provide a neat and uniform outward
appearance.US-A-4732630 discloses a modification in
which hot melted adhesive is applied to one side
of the tubular material. After the flat tubular
strips have been stacked and cut, they are placed
in an oven under pressure and the hot melted
adhesive is activated to bond the layers together. Both of the above window coverings have
a softer appearance than conventional venetian
blinds and good insulating properties. However,
they do not have the ability to control the amount
of light admitted through the window covering,
similar to a traditional venetian blind.US-A-3384519 attempts to overcome this
and discloses two cloth layers spaced apart by
moveable parallel and flexible fabric vanes having
each of their marginal edges heat welded to one of
the moveable cloth layers. With this window
covering, relative movement of the two cloth
layers in a direction perpendicular to the vanes
changes the angle of the vanes and thus controls
the amount of light admitted through the article.
Heat welding necessarily requires a melting of at
least some of the fibres of the materials bonded,
thus providing an uneven outer appearance along
the heat welds and producing unwanted crimps or
creases in the materials which can result in
failure of the fabric fibres. Further, heat
welding is a relatively slow process which may
require six or more seconds to create a bond over
an extended length, which is unacceptable for
commercial production. Furthermore, the heat
welds are limited in strength and it is difficult
to achieve uniformly straight heat-welded joints
over an extended length.US-A-2865446 discloses a window covering 
in which a long rectangular piece of fabric is
doubled back upon itself and a plurality of
accordion-pleated fabric elements are placed
between the folded-over sheets. Such a

<CLAIMS>
A shade (10,15,36,38,42,46,48) comprising at least a
first sheet (14) of flexible material having an inner face

(32); a plurality of elongate substantially rigid vanes (12)
having substantially planar faces (16) and opposite

longitudinal side edges (20,21) defining a given thickness;
said vanes (12) each being operatively connected in spaced

parallel relationship along one of their longitudinal side
edges (20) to the inner face (34) of said first sheet (14) to

provide a flexible attachment; and operating means (24-27) to
rotate said vanes (12) about parallel longitudinal axes (27);

between a closed position wherein said vanes extend
substantially parallel to said first sheet and an open position

wherein said vanes extend substantially perpendicular to said
first sheet, characterised in that the inner face (32) of said

first sheet (14) defines spaced elongate areas of attachment
which are each attached to an associated one of said vanes (12)

along a marginal area (18) of one of the planar faces (16) of
an associated one of said vanes (12), said marginal area

extending longitudinally adjacent one of the side edges (20) of
each vane and having a width larger than said given thickness.
A shade according to claim 1, characterised in that the
first sheet (14) is itself directly attached to the marginal

area (18) of each vane to provide said flexible attachment. 
A shade according to claim 2, characterised in that the
first sheet (14) is folded back and bonded to itself along said

spaced elongate areas of attachment.
A shade according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
the first sheet (14) is discontinuous and comprises a plurality

of contiguous strips (14S) of flexible sheet material, and in
that one marginal edge part (40,41) of each strip (14S) is

attached to the marginal area (18) of an adjacent one of said
vanes (12) and an opposite marginal edge part (40,41) of each

strip (14S) is attached to a next adjacent strip (14S) near the

area of attachment of said next adjacent strip to the adjacent
one of said vanes.
A shade according to claim 4, characterised in that said
one marginal edge part (40,41) of one of said contiguous strips

is attached to an adjacent one of said vanes by means of a
separate connector (44).
A shade according to claim 1 characterised in that the
first sheet (14) is a continuous sheet defining a length and a

width of one shade, and in that the spaced elongate areas of
attachment of said first sheet are each formed by a separate

flexible connector (44).
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the first sheet (14) is formed with a

crease (52) which points outwardly from said vanes (12) between
adjacent ones of said vanes, said crease extending parallel to 

the side edges of said vanes.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that said vanes (12) are made of plastic or

aluminium.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that the first sheet (14) is translucent and

each vane is opaque.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 9
characterised in that said vanes (12) extend vertically.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 10,
characterised in that the vanes (12) are attached to said first

A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that a plurality of cords (56) are attached to

the opposite longitudinal side edges (21) of the vanes (12)
opposite to said first sheet.
A shade according to any one of claims 1 to 11,
characterised in that a second sheet (14) has its inner face

(32) flexibly attached along spaced elongate areas of
attachment, at the opposite longitudinal side edge (21) of each

vane.
