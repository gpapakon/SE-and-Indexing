<ABSTRACT>
The device for assembling a bumper of a land motor vehicle on the structure of the latter has the general configuration of a deformable polygonal support clamp (20) which comprises faces (21) and at least four apices (22) which are joined by articulations (23) obtained by local thinning of the material of the apex (22) relative to the faces (21) which frame it. Application to front and/or rear bumpers.

Apparatus (20) for mounting a bumper (10) for a 
terrestrial motor vehicle on the structure (S) of the 

latter, which has the general configuration of a 
deformable polygonal support bracket (20) and which 

comprises surfaces (21) and at least four vertices (22), 
which is characterised in that the apparatus comprises 

articulations (23) obtained by local thinning of the 
material of each vertex (22) relative to the surfaces 

(21) which enclose it. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the support bracket (20) comprises a bridge (211), 

two opposing branches (212), one end of each branch 
being connected to the bridge (211) by an articulation 

(23), and two edge portions (213), each connected to the 
other end of one of the branches (212) by an 

articulation (23). 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the edge portions (213) are substantially parallel 

to the bridge (211). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 or 3, characterised 
in that the edge portions (213) extend in opposite 

directions. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the support bracket (20) is 

pierced through by an opening (2110). 
Apparatus according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the opening (2110) is oblong. 
Apparatus according to one of claims 5 and 6, 

characterised in that the opening (2110) is located on 
the bridge (211).  

 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 7 for 
a bumper (10) which comprises a covering, in particular, 

characterised in that the support bracket (20) is 
carried by this covering (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 8, characterised in 
that the support bracket (20) projects over one side of 

the covering (11) of the bumper and is aligned with an 
opening (111) provided in this covering (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 9, characterised in 
that the support bracket (20) is reversible by being 

passed through this opening (11) so as to project over 
the other side of the covering (11). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 10, 
characterised in that the support bracket (20) is made 

of a synthetic material. 
Apparatus according to claim 11, for a bumper the 
covering (11) of which is made of a synthetic material, 

characterised in that the support bracket (20) is fixed 
to the covering (11).
