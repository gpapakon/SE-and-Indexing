<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrolysis apparatus
for producing hydrogen by decomposing electrolytic
liquid into hydrogen and oxygen in a pressurized
electrotytic cell.Hydrogen is an ideal and non-polluting source of
energy in special applications in which no conventional
energy sources are available. Therefore, for instance in
devices using electric current and located in sparsely
populated and rough regions photovoltaic modules can
be used for producing electric current. Such installations
are frequently unmanned and require automatic or remole
control operation. Also such installations have to
be operated when there is no sunlight. Storing electricity
merely in batteries would require a large number of batteries,
which are heavy in weight and require maintenance.Using hydrogen for storing energy is one of the
means to recover the surplus energy produced by solar
cells, whereby water is decomposed into hydrogen and
oxygen. Thereby, electricity may, if needed, be produced
with the aid of a fuel cell from hydrogen. In order
to reduce the size of the hydrogen storages required,
the hydrogen must, however, be pressurized, and additional
energy must be used in the pressurization.It is known in the art to accomplish the decomposition
of water into hydrogen and oxygen in electrolytic
cells operating under pressure and thus producing hydrogen
directly in pressurized form, so that no separate
pressurization is needed. However increased leackage
is a drawback of pressurizing electrolytic cells.It is also known in the art to place an electrolytic cell
into a separate pressure shell, whereby the differential
pressure between the inside and outside of the electrolytic
cell substantially reduces and the leakages decrease.
Thus, in an apparatus as for instance in patent
publication FR-2466515, the pressure shell is pressurized
with the aid of nitrogen gas, and the apparatus
comprises members for maintaining the pressure within
the electrolytic cell lower than the pressure of the pressure
shell. Use of separate pressurizing gas requires,
however, containers for the pressurizing gases and
need for supplementing the pressurizing gas. Thus the
system disclosed in the patent is not suitable for installations
operating e.g. automatically in remote areas.It is known from GB patent No. 1518234 to place
the electrolytic plates inside a pressure shell, whereby
the pressure of hydrogen gas prevails inside the pressure
shell. However, in the design according to said patent
there is not a closed electrolytic cell placed
