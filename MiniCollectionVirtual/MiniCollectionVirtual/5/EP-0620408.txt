<ABSTRACT>
With the device with conveying surfaces arranged in a layered manner above one another and acted upon by heating or cooling fluid, a solution is to be produced, with which, as a result of compact construction, the required construction area is greatly reduced with great throughput capacity and the discharge of emissions to the environment or to the foundations is reduced considerably. This is achieved   - by there being provided one above another as conveying surfaces at least four vibrating conveying channels (5) of equal mass which are inclined alternately in relation to one another and which form a closed conveying path (arrows 11) for the bulk material, - by in each case two superposed conveying channels (5a, 5b) being provided in pairs with a vibrating drive (9) in the same direction, - by the vibrating conveying channels (5a, 5b) driven in the same direction being fastened on individually movable guiding rods (4a, 4b) which are inclined in opposite directions and - by the vibrating drive of the pair of vibrating conveying channels (50b, 50d) following one pair of pairs of vibrating conveying channels (50a, 50c) takes place with a phase displacement of 180@.

Apparatus (1) for heating or cooling bulk materials, in 
particular a brown coal preheater, comprising conveyor surfaces (5) which 

are acted upon by a heating or cooling fluid respectively and which are 
arranged in mutually superposed relationship in a tier arrangement and 

comprising a product feed (11a) at the beginning of the conveyor surfaces 
and a product discharge (11b) at the end of the conveyor surfaces and a 

feed and a discharge (13a, 13b) for the fluid producing the heating or 
cooling effect respectively, wherein 


at least four oscillating conveyor channels (5) which are of the 
same mass and which are inclined alternately relative to each other are 

disposed in superposed relationship as the conveyor surfaces, said 
channels forming a closed conveyor path (arrows 11) for the bulk 

material, 
each two conveyor channels (5a, 5b) disposed in mutually 
superposed relationship are provided in pairs with an oscillating drive 

(9) in the sane direction, 
the oscillating conveyor channels (5a, 5b) which are driven in 
the same direction are fixed to individually movable links (4a, 4b) which 

are inclined in opposite relationship, and 
the oscillating drive of the pair of oscillating conveyor 
channels (50b, 50d) which follows one pair of pairs of oscillating 

conveyor channels (50a, 50c) is effected with a phase displacement of 
180°, 
 
   characterised in that 


the heat treatment fluid, after acting upon a conveyor channel 
(5a or 5b), is fed to the next-but-one conveyor channel and after acting 

thereon is fed to the conveyor channel which is in turn next-but-one, and 
the heat treatment fluid is simultaneously fed from below 
upwardly by way of two inlets (13a, 13b) to the last and the penultimate 

conveyor channel and is removed at the upper ends of the second and the 
first conveyor channels (5b and 5a respectively) in such a way that a 

pair of conveyor channels (5) which is driven in the same direction is 
acted upon by the fluid once in counter-flow relationship and once in co-flow 

relationship, in each case in relation to the direction of conveying 

movement of the bulk material. 
Apparatus according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
heating or cooling fluid flows in the form of liquid through flow 

passages (12) on the oscillating conveyor channels (5). 
Apparatus according to claim 2 characterised in that the side 
walls of the oscillating conveyor channels (5) are provided with flow 

passages (12a). 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the oscillating conveyor channels (5) are of 

substantially rectangular configuration with drives (6) at the outside 
edges in the edge regions of a narrow side. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that all oscillating drives (9) disposed in superposed 

relationship are respectively provided on a common shaft (8) with drive 
motor (6a), wherein with two drive shafts (8) at the outside edges said 

drive shafts are synchronised relative to each other. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised by a plurality of double pairs of oscillating conveyor 

channels (50a, 50b/50c, 50d) in a common frame (2) wherein adjacent 
double pairs of oscillating conveyor channels are in turn driven with a 

phase displacement of 180°. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims for use in 
brown coal power stations characterised in that the flow passages (12) 

are acted upon by process condensate. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the flow passages (12) are provided with flushing 

connections for the removal of deposits or the like by means of a 
flushing fluid.  

 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that provided in the flow passages (12) at least at the 

feed and the discharge are distributor devices such as screen members 
which are formed therein for positively distributing the fluid. 
Apparatus according to one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the conveyor surfaces are made from a stainless 

steel with a small depth of roughness in particular to prevent sticky 
bulk material from caking on the oscillating conveyor channels (5).
