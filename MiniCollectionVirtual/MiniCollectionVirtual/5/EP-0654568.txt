<ABSTRACT>
Figure 1 shows a sectional view of a single-string load-bearing structure 1 which is suitable for a flight of stairs and exhibits a multiplicity of horizontal load-bearing strings 2 which are arranged in the form of steps one behind the other in a row and are supported on one another by a sleeve 5 in each case. As connecting element, use is made, in this arrangement, of load-bearing bolts 7 which act as tie rods and of which the shanks 11 engage through bores 6a, located in the load-bearing strings 2, and the sleeves 5 and are braced by means of screws 10. The external diameter a of said load-bearing-bolt shanks 11 is, in this arrangement, smaller than the internal diameter d of the sleeves 5, such that the latter can be displaced in the radial direction with respect to the load-bearing-bolt shanks 11.

<CLAIMS>
Supporting structure for a flight, with at least one capping piece and formed of many 
adjacent, interconnected and stepwise staggered supporting members which on one hand 

consist of the support of the horizontal supporting capping pieces used as step plate and on 
the other hand consists of two of the carrying supports each interconnecting these supporting 

capping pieces and which are formed as pipe sections, sleeves or the like, while the 
horizontal supporting capping pieces and the vertical carrying supports are braced by means 

of vertical supporting studs acting as tie rod and gripping through the carrying supports; the 
inside diameters of the pipe sections, sleeves or the like are larger than the outside diameters 

of the supporting studs
characterized in that
 
the pipe sections, sleeves or the like are at least partially staggered laterally opposite the 

supporting studs (7) gripping through them and are arranged eccentrically opposite the 
center line of these supporting studs (7). 
Supporting structure acc. to claim 1, characterized in that the pipe sections, sleeves (5) and 
the like are made of timber and are composed of bonded sections (15). 
Supporting structure acc. to claim 1 and/or 2,
 
characterized in that
 
each of the sections (15) extend across a sector of the circumference of the pipe sections or 

sleeves (5). 
Supporting structure acc. to claim 2 and/or 3,
 
characterized in that
 
the sections (15) are connected by tongue-and-groove joints (22/23). 
Supporting structure acc. to claims 2 to 4,
 
characterized in that
 
pipe sections, sleeves (5) or the like are composed of 12 sections (15) each.
