<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tensile force measuring apparatus for the measurement of tensile forces of running endless materials, especially threads or webs. This tensile force measuring apparatus is seated on a mandrel clamped in a fixed location and has a clamping region and a bearing region which can be moved freely with respect to the mandrel in the force direction. Clamping region and bearing region are connected to each other by means of bending springs.
