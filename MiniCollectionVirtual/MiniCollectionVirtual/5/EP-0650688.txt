<ABSTRACT>
A suction member for use with a vacuum cleaner 
is provided which includes a suction member body 1 having 

substantially centrally thereof a connection pipe to be 
connected to the vacuum cleaner 1, air inlets defined in 

lower portions of the outer periphery of the suction 
member body 1 on both sides of the suction member body 1, 

and rotatable members 8 defining a multiplicity of 
perforations and each rotatably provided around the outer 

periphery of the suction member body 1 on either side of 

the suction member body 1. The provision of the rotatable 
members defining the multiplicity of perforations and 

each rotatably provided around the outer periphery of the 
suction member body on either side of the suction member 

body allows the suction member body to exhibit improved 
mobility and the suction member to enjoy improved cleaning 

operability.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements in
suction members to be attached to vacuum cleaners for use
in cleaning, for example, bedclothes and curtains.Among conventional suction members of this type,
there are known suction members of the type having a
rotatable member with a multiplicity of perforations
rotatably mounted on a cylindrical suction member body, as
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
158068/1979 (92(3)D101.9) and Japanese Unexamined Utility
Model Publication No. 79761/1977 (92(3)D101.9). These
suction members are adapted to draw in dust from an air
inlet defined in a lower portion of the outer surface of
the suction member body through the rotatable member and
thereby to collect dust into a vacuum cleaner through a
pipe connected to a side of the suction member body.The suction member disclosed in Japanese Utility
Model Publication No. 79761/1977 (92(3)D101.9) comprises
a suction member body defining air inlets in a lower
portion of the outer surface thereof, a suction member
cover fitted around and bonded to a lateral side of the
suction member body with a pipe to be connected to a
vacuum cleaner being force fitted thereinto, and a
rotatable member with a multiplicity of perforations
rotatably covering the outer surface of the suction member
body, the rotatable member being supported at the outer
surface of a pipe support portion of the suction member
cover so as not drop out.The rotatable member of the suction member
disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No.
158068/1979 comprises an annular one-piece mesh covering
the entire outer surface of the suction member
body. This impedes easy changes of the moving direction
of the suction member body, resulting in poor cleaning
operability.Further, since the rotatable member is of a 
simple mesh structure, hair and waste thread are likely to
be caught by the rotatable member and, hence, a difficulty
exists in cleaning a surface of an object.Still further, since the rotatable member abuts
the entire outer surface of the suction member body, the
rotatable member has an increased friction resistance
against the suction member body and hence suffers poor
mobility and poor cleaning operability.Furthermore, the rotatable member comprises the
annular one-piece mesh covering the entire outer surface
of the cylindrical suction member body and an air inlet
is defined by notching a portion of the cylindrical
body of the suction member body. For this reason, the
suction member body is likely to sink into bedclothes or
