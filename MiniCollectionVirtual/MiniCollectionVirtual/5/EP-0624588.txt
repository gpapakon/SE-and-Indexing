<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new quinoline derivatives which are 
potent platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonists and/or 5-lipoxygenase 
enzyme inhibitors. The invention also relates to a process for their 
preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use 
in the treatment of diseases in which PAF and/or 5-lipoxygenase are involved. The platelet activating factor (PAF) or (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glyceryl-3-phosphorylcholine), 
also called acetyl glyceryl ether phosphorylcholine 
(AGEPC) or PAF-acether, is a natural phospholipid synthesized by different 
cells (basophiles, macrophages, neutrophiles, platelets) and tissues (heart, lung 
and kidney) of the organism. PAF was described for the first time as a potent platelet aggregating 
agent. Later on it was demonstrated to have other biological activities in vivo, 
such as peripheral vasodilatation, increase of the vascular permeability, 
induction of bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivity of the respiratory tract. 
PAF also produces immediate hypotension followed by pulmonary and renal 
hypertension in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs, and it has been rated as the 
most potent ulcerogenic agent described until now. Consequently, PAF is a mediator that is implicated in a large set of 
pathological processes such as asthma, septic shock, transplant rejection, 
thrombosis, ulceration, inflammation and renal diseases. On the other hand, other cellular mediators such as the leukotrienes 
have been implicated as important mediators in several inflammmatory 
diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and inflammatory 
bowel disease. The leukotrienes are the resulting products of the oxidation of 
arachidonic acid through the action of the enzyme 5-lipoxygenase. It has been 
postulated that compounds that act as inhibitors of this enzyme thereby 
preventing the synthesis of leukotrienes could offer great promise as 
therapeutic agents in the treatment of those disorders. In light of this, compounds that exhibit a dual activity as PAF 
antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors could be extremely useful 
therapeutic agents in the treatment of complex pathologies such as asthma, 
allergic disorders and other inflammatory diseases. The closest prior art from the structural point of view is believed to be 
the compounds disclosed in patent application EP 367110, which relates to 
diazepines with PAF antagonist activity, different from the compounds of the  
 
present invention. The present invention describes new
