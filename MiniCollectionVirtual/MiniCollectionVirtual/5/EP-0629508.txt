<ABSTRACT>
A recording head comprises a linear array of light-emitting 
diodes (LEDs) on a common thermally conductive 

LED carrier bar (30). The carrier bar carries a series 
of modules, each module containing N LEDs with their 

associated drivers. The carrier bar is provided with a 
cooling means in thermally conductive contact therewith. 

The cooling means comprises a U-shaped duct inside a 
thermally conductive body (50) in thermally conductive 

contact with the carrier bar (30), said duct extending 
between a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet. The duct (57) 

has flowing therethrough a cooling fluid such as water.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a temperature-conditioned 
LED recording head comprising light emitting 
diodes (LEDs) and an electrophotographic printer 
containing one or more of such recording heads for image-wise 
exposure of photoconductive member(s) of the 
printer. In electrophotographic printing an overall 
electrostatically charged photoconductive dielectric 
recording member is image-wise exposed to conductivity 
increasing radiation producing thereby a "direct" or 
"reversal" toner-developable charge pattern on the 
recording member. "Direct" development is a positive-positive 
development, and is suited for producing 
pictures and text. "Reversal" development is a "positive-negative" or vice 
versa development process and is of particular interest 
when the exposure derives from an image in digital 
electrical form, wherein the electrical signals modulate 
a laser beam or the light output of light-emitting diodes 
(LEDs). It is advantageous with respect to a reduced 
load of the electrical signal modulated light source 
(laser or LEDs) to record graphic information (e.g. 
printed text) in such a way that the light information 
corresponds with the graphic characters so that by 
"reversal" development in the exposed area of a 
photoconductive recording layer, toner can be deposited  
 
to produce a positive reproduction of the electronically 
stored original. In high speed electrophotographic 
printing the exposure derives practically always from 
electronically stored, e.g. computer stored, 
information. In the electrophotographic art multi-colour printers are 
known that produce a plurality of colour toner images on 
a photoconductive drum or endless belt wherefrom the 
toner images are transferred directly onto printing stock 
material such as a paper sheet or paper web material. In 
an alternative embodiment the toner images formed on a 
photoconductive recording member are transferred 
subsequently to an intermediate insulating belt from 
distinct image forming stations and are then transferred 
simultaneously to a receiving sheet or web that 
eventually is cut into sheets containing a desired 
printing frame dimension. At present, more and more use is made of LED arrays at 
the exposure station of electrophotographic printers, the 
light from the LEDs being focused by an optical system, 
e.g. by a rod-like lens array, onto the photoconductive 
drum or belt, taking advantage of the fact that LED 
exposure stations have no moving parts and that no 
complicated optics are required,
