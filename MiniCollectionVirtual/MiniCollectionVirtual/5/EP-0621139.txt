For the fabricating or finishing (individualisation) of cards such as credit cards or the like, wherein corresponding data, including an image, are applied to a subsequent card layer in mirror-image fashion by means of a video printing method and the card consisting of this and at least one other layer is laminated, it is proposed that the card layer submitted to video printing be designed as a double layer (10) consisting of film (11, 11') which is to be printed and carrier layer (12, 12'), and that score lines or perforations be made on the latter, at least one of which corresponds to the later useful format.
