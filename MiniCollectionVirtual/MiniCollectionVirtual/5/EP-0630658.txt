<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus to establish access into the uterus and 
the fallopian tubes of a female for diagnostic or 

therapeutic procedures includes a cervical access catheter, 
an ostial access catheter insertable through the cervical 

access catheter, and a fallopian access catheter insertable 
through the ostial access catheter. The cervical access 

catheter incorporates a distally located intrauterine 
balloon which is inflatable after insertion into the 

uterus. The cervical access catheter also incorporates a 

cervical retention disk which can be slid into position 
against the anterior lip of the cervix to anchor the 

cervical access catheter into the cervical canal between 
the intrauterine balloon and the cervical disk. Once the 

cervical access catheter is properly anchored, the ostial 
access catheter is inserted through the cervical access 

catheter. The ostial access catheter has a guidable distal 
portion which, after the distal portion has passed through 

the cervical access catheter, can be positioned into the 
ostium of the fallopian tube. If desired, a contrast media 

can then be injected through the ostial access catheter. 
Further, if additional information is required, the 

fallopian access catheter can be inserted through the 
ostial access catheter and advanced into the fallopian tube 

for injection of a contrast media directly into the 
fallopian tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains generally to catheters
and medical devices which are useful for diagnostic and
therapeutic procedures involving the uterus and fallopian
tubes of a female. More particularly, the present
invention pertains to a system of catheters which interact
to precisely establish an access path into the uterus and
fallopian tubes for insertion of medical instruments or for
the injection of a contrast media or other fluids. The
present invention is particularly, but not exclusively,
useful for hysterosalpingography and selective
salpingography procedures.Hysterosalpingography is a well known medical
procedure which involves recording images of anatomical
structures of the uterus and fallopian uterine tubes. More
specifically, during the procedure, an opaque or contrast
media fluid is injected into the uterus and the fallopian
tubes. Hysterosalpingography is used quite extensively to
examine the uterus and fallopian tubes of a female for
obstructions or anatomical abnormalities which might impair
and prevent insemination or fertilization. It is a
frequently performed procedure and to be effective it must,
like other medically probative procedures, provide a high
degree of accuracy in the resultant diagnosis.There are, of course, other medical procedures wherein
it is necessary to establish access or fluid communication
with the uterus or the fallopian tubes. For instance, it
is sometimes possible to inject fluid medicaments into the
uterus or fallopian tubes for therapeutic purposes.
Further, the insertion of instruments into the uterus or
fallopian tubes may be indicated for procedures such as a
biopsy. In any case, there are numerous procedures wherein
it is desirable or necessary to establish access or fluid 
communication with either the uterus or the fallopian
tubes.Devices and systems which are presently being used to
gain access for medical instruments into the uterus and
fallopian tubes, or which are being used for the injection
of a fluid contrast media into the uterus and fallopian
tubes for a hysterosalpingography procedure, must pass
through the cervix. Most incorporate a catheter which must
somehow be anchored to the uterus to prevent dislodgment of
the catheter during the procedure. How this is done, of
course, differs from device to device. Several examples
can be cited.U.S. Patent No. 5,104,377 which issued to Levine for
an invention entitled "Uterine Access Device with Automatic
Cervical Adjustment" discloses a device for accessing the
uterus to either manipulate the
