<ABSTRACT>
A full metal jacket hollow point bullet (110) is disclosed which has a portion of the jacket (120) extending within the hollow open front end (116) of the bullet. The portion of the jacket in the hollow front end has a plurality of radial slits and reinforced pointed prongs (126) therebetween. An empty blind bore (128) extends from the tips of the prongs (126) axially rearwardly into the bullet core (114). The base of each of the prongs is reinforced at the mouth of the front end by a fillet (130). These prongs (126) project generally radially outward upon upset of the bullet in soft tissue after passing through barrier materials such as clothing and deer hide. The jacket has a coating of copper oxide (123) on its inner and outer surfaces which bonds the soft lead core to the jacket and minimizes lead wash and lubricates the bullet.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to bullets and
more particularly to a small caliber projectile having a
hollow point and a full metal jacket.A bullet in accordance with the pre-characterizing part of claim 1
is known from US-A-5,101,732.Jacketed bullets are well known in the art. The
bullet typically is made of a lead alloy and has a
jacket typically made of a copper alloy and covers at
least part of the ogive and the cylindrical body
portions of the bullet. This type of jacketed bullet
gives a more controlled expansion in soft body tissue
than an unjacketed lead bullet. Further expansion can
be obtained upon initial target penetration by providing
a hollow in the front end of the bullet. The front end
may also be formed with cuts and/or ribs in the jacket
or with cuts or ribs in the core within the hollow tip
to further control the expansion upon upset of the
bullet in soft tissue.One typical hollow joint jacketed bullet is
disclosed in US-A-3,157,137, assigned to the
assignee of the present invention. This patent
discloses a jacketed bullet with a rosette type of
hollow point formed entirely from the open jacket end.
Another is disclosed in US-A-3,349,711 which has external
cuts in the ogive portion of the full metal jacket
around the hollow tip. Another example is
US-A-4,550,662. In this patent, the hollow tip is formed
with axially extending ribs in the soft metal core.Another hollow point jacketed bullet, using
aluminum for the jacket, is disclosed in US-A-4,610,061, 
assigned to the assignee of the present
invention. In this patent, the jacket extends only part
way into the hollow and partial cuts are made in the.
jacket at the rim of the hollow point.All of these bullets provide relatively
predictable curling back of the. jacket upon upset of the
bullet in soft tissue. The petals formed by the jacket
segments peeling back curl beyond 180Â°, folding under
the expanding head of the bullet, along the cylindrical
portion thereof. Thus the cutting swath in soft tissue
is generally determined by the outer diameter of the
expanded head of the upset bullet.Maximum expansion of the head is desirable to
maximize hemorrhaging and tissue damage. This maximized
expansion maximizes the lethality in game animals.
However, if the head expands too much, the bullet will
separate into segments which limits the penetration.
Accordingly, to obtain significant depth of penetration,
the mass of the bullet must remain behind the head.When a particular projectile is designed for law
enforcement use consideration must be

A bullet (110) comprising:

a malleable metal body (114) symmetrical about an axis
therethrough, said body (114) having a forwardly open recess (118)

in one end, said recess (118) having a forward divergent portion
(121), said divergent portion (121) terminating in a mouth (119) at

said end; and
a metal jacket (120) over a major portion of said body (114)
enclosing said one end, said jacket 
(120) extending fully into said
divergent portion (121) of said recess (118) over said mouth (119),

said jacket (120) in said divergent portion (121) having a plurality
of circumferentially spaced radial slits (122) forming pointed prongs

(126) therebetween, said prongs (126) each having a hardened
transition region about said mouth (119),
characterized in that
said recess (118) has an coaxial extension portion (128) joining said
divergent portion (121) at an annular base (124) therebetween, and

that at least one reinforcing rib (130) is provided on at least one of
said prongs (126) about said mouth (119).
The bullet according to claim 1 characterized in that each of said
slits (122) extends completely through said jacket (120) in said

recess (118).
The bullet according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in that each of
said prongs (126) has two ribs (13) at the mouth (119) of said

recess (118).
The bullet according to any one of claims 1 to 3 characterized in
that said ribs (130) extend from the tip of the prong (126) to a point

on an outer forward side (116) of the bullet (110). 
The bullet according to any one of claims 1 to 4 characterized in
that the bullet (110) has a copper oxide coating (123) on its

exterior.
The bullet according to any one of claims 1 to 5 characterized in
that said rib (130) is an inwardly bent edge portion of the prong

(126) of said jacket (120) adjacent said slit (122) at said mouth
(119) of said recess (118).
The bullet according to any one of claims 1 to 6 characterized in
that said extension portion (128) is a cylindrical hole extending

rearwardly from said base (124) having a generally curved bottom.
The bullet according to any one of claims 1 to 7 characterized in
that said jacket (120) further comprises an oxide coating (123) on

the inside surface of said jacket (120) frictionally bonding with said
body (114).
