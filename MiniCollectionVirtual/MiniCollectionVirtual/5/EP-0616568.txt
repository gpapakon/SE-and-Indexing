<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related generally to material used 
for packaging, or dunnage, and, more particularly, to 
free-flowing dunnage materials and methods and apparatus 
for their manufacture. Free-flowing packaging materials, or "dunnage" or 
"loose fill" as otherwise known, involve pieces varying 
greatly in size and shape. That is, some free-flowing 
dunnages are pieces shaped like peanut shells, while 
others are rings and still others are other dish-shaped 
pieces. Whatever the form and material used, the quality 
of any free-flowing dunnage for packaging purposes is 
dependent on certain characteristics.  
 Among the desirable qualities in any free-flowing 
dunnage material are structural strength, low density and 
volume maintenance. Ideally the material should also be 
light in weight, easy to use, versatile for use with any 
packaged product or with any type of container, non-settling, 
reusable and static-free, and should prevent 
movement of products packed within a container and 
contact between a product's surfaces and interior 
surfaces of the container. Foamed plastic materials have dominated the market 
for free-flowing dunnage, and are made in pieces of 
various shapes and sizes. Free-flowing dunnage of foamed 
plastic tends to be light in weight but also tends to 
have certain disadvantages in handling, such as excessive 
static problems. Furthermore, environmental concerns 
have raised considerable questions regarding the use of 
foamed plastic as a dunnage material, given that plastics 
which have been used are not biodegradable. There are many examples of inventions involving 
plastic free-flowing dunnage, including those disclosed 
in the following United States patents: Patent No. 5 151 312 (Boeri), 
3,723,240 (Skochdopole et al.), Patent No. 3,855,053 
(Fuss), and Patent No. 3,933,959 (Skochdopole et al.). 
While free-flowing dunnage of plastic has been most 
widely used, there are prior disclosures of free-flowing 
dunnage of other materials, including materials involving 
use of pulp fiber. However, despite the disadvantages 
and concerns of using foamed plastic as a free-flowing 
dunnage material, foamed plastic has continued to 
dominate in this field. Among prior disclosures showing use of pulp fiber 
are United States Patent No. 4,997,091 (McCrea), which 
teaches manufacture of free-flowing pulp dunnage by 
extruding pieces of paper fiber and allowing them to dry 
into solid shapes. However, this material, while it is 
biodegradable, is disadvantageous in that the heavy

<CLAIMS>
Free-flowing dunnage packaging material 
comprising a free-flowing multiplicity of pieces (10) of 

molded pulp wherein the pieces form dish shapes each 
having a hollowed surface defining a central void (12) 

surrounded by an edge (14), the edges and central voids of the 
pieces being randomly shaped. 
The dunnage packaging material of claim 1 
wherein lateral cross-sections of each of the pieces of 

molded pulp vary randomly in size and shape along the 
length thereof. 
The dunnage packaging material of claim 1 
wherein, on at least one lateral cross-section of each 

piece of the material, the central void and the edges are 
such that the space between the edges is less t
han the 
cross-dimensional space at the widest part of the central 

void on such cross-section. 
The dunnage packaging material of claim 1 
wherein the edges are beaded, thereby providing greater 

strength in the edges than in the hollowed surface.  
 
A method for manufacture of a free-flowing 
dunnage comprising: 


mixing pulp fibers with water to form a water-based 
pulp-stock slurry; 
capturing damp pulp fibers from the slurry onto a 
screen; 
partially drying the pulp fibers on the screen to 
form individual dish-shaped intermediate pieces; 
form-free removing of the partially-dried 
intermediate pieces from the screen; and 
thereafter drying the intermediate pieces free of 
form support; 
 
thereby to form random dish-shaped dunnage pieces which 

resist nesting with each other. 
The method of claim 5 wherein the form-free 
removal step includes blowing the intermediate pieces 

from the screen to land prior to further drying, the 
blowing and landing altering the shapes of the 

intermediate pieces thereby to enhance randomness in the 
shapes of the dunnage pieces. 
The method of claim 6 wherein: 

the screen overlies a backing plate which with the 
screen determines shapes of the intermediate pieces; 
the backing plate has a plurality of apertures 
through which such blowing occurs to remove the 

intermediate pieces; and 
the partial drying step includes drawing air by 
vacuum through the damp pulp fibers, the screen, and 

the apertures, the apertures being used both for 
partial drying and for removal by blowing. 
The method of claim 7 wherein the partial drying 
step further includes providing a source of heated air 

adjacent to the screen, drawing such heated air through 
the damp pulp fibers, the screen, and the apertures.  

 
An apparatus for manufacture of a free-flowing 
molded pulp dunnage comprising: 


a backing plate and a screen overlying such backing 
plate together forming a plurality of die-sites 

shaped for dunnage pieces; 
means to capture damp pulp fibers on the screen in 
the die-sites; 
means to partially dry the pulp fibers on the 
screen to form individual dish-shaped intermediate 

pieces; 
form-free means to remove the partially-dried 
intermediate pieces from the screen to positions 

which are free of form support; and 
means to dry the intermediate pieces free of form 
support; 
 
thereby causing contortion of the intermediate pieces 

into random dish-shaped dunnage pieces which resist 
nesting with each other. 
The apparatus of claim 9 wherein the removal 
means comprises means to blow the intermediate pieces 

from the screen to land prior to further drying. 
The apparatus of claim 10 wherein: 

the blowing means includes a plurality of apertures 
in the backing plate through which such blowing 

occurs to remove the intermediate pieces; and 
the means to partially dry includes vacuum means 
for drawing air through the damp pulp fibers, the 

screen, and the apertures, the apertures being used 
both for partial drying and for removal by blowing. 
The apparatus of claim 11 wherein the means for 
partial drying further includes means to heat the air 

adjacent to the screen, whereby heated air is drawn 
through the damp pulp fibers, the screen, and the 

apertures.
