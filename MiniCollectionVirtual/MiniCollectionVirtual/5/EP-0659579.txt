<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a protective layer transfer sheet which can be transferred
easily onto an image by heat during printing, thereby obtaining an excellent
printed matter excellent in durability, particularly friction resistance, luster,
color formability and without generation of curl by a simple operation. In the prior art, many cards such as identification
certificates, driving licenses, membership cards, etc.
have been used, and on these cards are recorded various
informations for clarifying identification, etc. of the
owner. Particularly, in ID card, etc., face photograph
is the most important.A classical method for imparting face photograph to
various cards is a method to plater a face photograph to
a predetermined portion of a card substrate by use of an
adhesive, but this method is very cumbersome in its
operation, and also has the drawback that unevenness is
created on the card surface to lose flatness.Whereas, in the prior art, there has been developed
an image forming method according to the sublimation
transfer method. The sublimation transfer method is a
method in which a sublimation transfer sheet having a
layer containing a dye which is sublimation transferred
by heat on the surface of a substrate film and an image
receiving sheet are superposed, and a desired image is
formed on the image receiving sheet by heating with a
thermal head according to an image information from the
back of the sublimation transfer sheet, and there is the
advantage that it can be practiced by a simple heat
transfer printer.Whereas, when the sublimation transfer system is
applied to a card medium such as ID card, the card
substrate is demanded to have sufficient dyeability for a
sublimable dye. However, most of the card substrates of 
the prior art have no sufficient dyeability for
sublimable dyes, and therefore no image formation can be
effected thereon as such. As the method for solving such
drawback, a method of previously forming an image
receiving layer excellent in dyeability for a sublimable
dye may be conceivable, but formation of such image
receiving layer on a card substrate is cumbersome in
steps, whereby there is the problem of increasing the
production cost of the card substrate. Further, when an
image receiving layer is provided separately on the
surface of a card substrate, there will ensue such
problems that the card substrate may be curled or the
image receiving layer may be peeled off as caused by the
heat applied during image formation.The present invention has been accomplished in
