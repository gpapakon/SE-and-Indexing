<ABSTRACT>
A ball joint, which essentially consists of a ball (13) at the end of a ball rod (14), a lower ball cup (16) adjacent to the ball neck (19) and an upper ball cup (17) associated with the ball head (20), which contain the ball (13) between them so that it can slide, a ball (13) and ball cups (16, 17) and a casing (11) surrounding a closure cover (22) and a compression spring in contact under the cover (22) and holding the ball cups (16, 17) and the ball (13) in position, has the special feature that the upper ball cup (17) itself takes the form of a compression spring like a cup spring and is permanently in direct contact with both the cover (22) and the ball (13). Operating forces can therefore cause only a distortion of the compression spring but cannot cause two components not previously in position to strike each other. A further advantage lies in the simplified layout and the elimination of a component, for, in the invention, the upper ball cup is itself a compression spring, and the prior art spiral compression spring is no longer needed.
