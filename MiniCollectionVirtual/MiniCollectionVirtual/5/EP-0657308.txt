<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to paillettes which are suitable for the decoration of articles made from glass, porcelain and ceramic with vertical walls. The paillettes essentially comprise an organic binder system and a vitrifiable inorganic substance which forms the decoration, in general from 10 to 40% by weight of binder, from 50 to 90% by weight of an inorganic substance based on a glass-forming product and/or pigment and/or metal oxides, and from 0 to 10% by weight of additives. The production of the paillettes comprises preparing a paste, forming a film or flakes, polymerisation and cutting. For the decoration, the paillettes are applied to the articles to be decorated and fired (baked) at temperatures between 500 and 1450 DEG C.

<CLAIMS>
Paillettes for the decoration of glass, porcelain and
ceramics,

characterised in that

they consist substantially of an organic binder system
and of a decorative vitrifiable inorganic substance

and are obtainable from a film or from sheets of the
above-mentioned composition.
Paillettes according to claim 1,

characterised in that

the organic binder system consists substantially of
one or more polymers or copolymers from among the

polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyvinyl acetates
or polyvinyl butyrates, which may also be to some

extent cross-linked by means of multifunctional vinyl
compounds.
Paillettes according to claim 2,

characterised in that

the vitrifiable material is in the form of an opaque
or transparent glass frit, which may be coloured or

colourless.
Paillettes according to claim 3,

characterised in that

the decorative inorganic substance contains in
addition one or more inorganic pigments and/or metal

oxides, metal phosphates or metal silicates.
Paillettes according to one of claims 1 to 4,

characterised in that

they have a thickness of from 25 to 1000 x 10
-6
 m and
contain substantially 10 to 40 wt.% of an organic

binder, 50 to 90 wt.% of an inorganic decorative
substance and 0 to 10 wt.% additives. 
Process for the production of paillettes for the
decoration of glass, porcelain and ceramics according

to one of the preceding claims,

characterised in that

an organic binder which is liquid or paste-like or
dissolved or suspended in a solvent system and is

based on polymer resins or copolymer resins and/or
polycondensation resins and/or polyaddition resins, or

intermediates of the binder systems, is or are
homogeneously mixed with a decorative vitrifiable

inorganic substance and, if necessary, with additives,
such as plasticisers, drying accelerators,

photoinitiators, solvents and agents for adjusting
viscosity, this mixture is converted into a film or

sheet (flakes) and from these paillettes of the
required form are obtained after the polymerisation.
Process according to claim 6,

characterised in that

a mixture of at least one or more glass frits and one
or more inorganic pigments and/or metal oxides, metal

phosphates or metal silicates is used as the
decorative inorganic substance.
Process according to claim 6 or 7,

characterised in that

a system based on acrylic resin and/or methacrylic
resin is used as organic binder and, if cross-linking

is required, a di- or trimethylacrylate or di- or
triacrylate is used as cross-linking agent.
Process for decorating glass, porcelain and ceramics
by application of solid substances in the form of

small particles to the surface to be decorated and
subsequent firing at a temperature of from 500°C up to

1430°C,

characterised in that
 
paillettes according to one of claims 1 to 5 are used

as solid substances in the form of small particles.
Process according to claim 9,

characterised in that

first of all an adhesive solution, which is completely
vaporised during the firing, is applied to the surface

to be decorated, and then the paillettes are applied
to the adhesive.
