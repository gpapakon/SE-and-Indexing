<ABSTRACT>
A digital answering system (100 ) automatically answers incoming
calls from a telephone network and records audible messages. The answering system

includes a calendar memory (110) which stores the present time-of-day and day-of-year.
The answering system also includes stored playback commands which instruct

it to generate telephone ringing signals at a predetermined time and then play back a
recorded audible reminder message. The answering system may be a stand-alone

unit which is parallel-connected to the telephone network and which generates
an audible alerting signal at the predetermined time. Alternatively, the answering

system (100) may be series-connected between the telephone network and a pair of
conductors to which one or more extension telephones are connected in parallel. In

the latter case, recorded audible reminder messages are delivered to an extension
telephone after the answering system causes them to ring at the predetermined time.

The playback command and audible reminder message are simultaneously entered,
either remotely or locally, into the answering system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to telephone answering machines, and 
more particularly to the delivery of recorded messages. Reminder services are available in a variety of forms that have become 
increasingly more convenient to users since the time when roosters were relied upon 
to announce the dawn. Perhaps the most familiar product is an alarm clock which 
mechanically or electrically generates an alerting signal at a predetermined time. 
Indeed, radios, television sets, and even coffee pots are now programmable to turn 
ON at selected times. However, because of the vast number of activities that people 
are now scheduling into their lives, it may not be obvious to most people why an 
alarm clock is ringing at 2:15 in the afternoon. One solution to the above problems was provided in a product sold by 
AT&T known as the GENESIS Telecommunication System. A programmable 
Electronic Reminder Cartridge was plugged into the Telecommunications System that 
recorded up to 40 appointments and daily reminders by selecting from a menu of 24 
fixed messages. On the specified day, one of the messages would appear on a visual 
display and an audible alarm would ring. Unfortunately, such products are relatively 
expensive, programming is not intuitive, and the variety of messages is limited. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide an inexpensive system that 
delivers messages to users at one or more predetermined times in the future. A telephone answering system includes apparatus for recording audible 
messages, a calendar memory which stores the present time-of-day, and a playback 
memory which stores a predetermined time when the recorded audible message is to 
be played back. Moreover, at the predetermined time, the answering system generates 
an alerting signal which must to be acknowledged before the recorded audible 
message is played back. In one illustrative embodiment of the invention the answering system 
is series-connected between the telephone network and a pair of conductors to which 
one or more extension telephones are connected in parallel. Audible reminder 
messages are transmitted to an extension telephone, following a ringing signal, in 
response to an extension telephone entering the off-hook state.  In another illustrative embodiment of the invention, the answering 
system is parallel-connected to the telephone network and includes a tone ringer 
which responds either to conventional ringing signals from the telephone network or 
to a playback command signal which is generated at the

<CLAIMS>
An answering system (100, 200) for automatically answering 
incoming calls from a telephone network and for storing (150) audible messages, the 

system including a calendar memory (110) for storing data representing the present 
time-of-day 

   CHARACTERIZED BY 
   means (110) for receiving and storing a playback command which 

includes time-of-day data indicating when a particular stored audible message is to be 
played back; 

   means (110) for comparing the time-of-day data stored in the calendar 
memory with the time-of-day data contained in the playback command; 

   means (119, 230) for generating an alerting signal when there is 
correspondence between the time-of-day data in the playback command and in the 

calendar memory; and 
   means (160, 170, 190, 290) for playing back the particular stored 

audible message in response to an acknowledgment of the alerting signal. 
The answering system (100, 200) of claim 1 further including 
microphone means (180, 280) and digital message recording means (170, 160, 150) 

for converting audible sounds, presented to the answering system, into a digitally 
recorded message, the answering system further including keypad means (140, 270) 

for entering the playback command. 
The answering system (100, 200) of claim 1 wherein the calendar 
memory and the playback command further include day-of-year data. 
The answering system (100) of claim 1 wherein said system is 
series connected between the telephone network and a pair of conductors to which one 

or more extension telephone sets are parallel-connected. 
The answering system (100) of claim 4 wherein the alerting signal 
(119) is applied to the pair of conductors for causing an extension telephone set to 

ring. 
The answering system (100) of claim 5 wherein the extension 
telephone set has an active (off-hook) state and an idle (on-hook) state, and wherein a 

change from the idle state to the active state constitutes acknowledgment of the 
alerting signal. 
The answering system (100) of claim 6 further including current 
detecting means (120), responsive to the flow of electrical current on the pair of 

conductors, for 
   detecting the change from idle to active state of one of the extension 

telephone sets. 
The answering system (200) of claim 1 wherein said system is 
parallel-connected to the telephone network. 
The answering system (200) of claim 8 further including 
microphone (280) and loudspeaker (290) means interconnected to the telephone 

network for enabling operation as a standard telephone set. 
A method for providing audible reminder service using a telephone 
answering system (100, 200) comprising the steps of: 

   recording an audible reminder message in a digital memory (150) of 
the telephone answering system; 

   entering into the digital memory a playback command, comprising the 
time-of-day, indicating when the reminder message is to be played back; 

   periodically updating a calendar memory (110) within the telephone 
answering system to stor
e information indicating the present time-of-day; 
   generating an alerting signal when the present time-of-day is 

substantially equal to the time-of-day information within the playback command; 
   sensing an acknowledgment of the alerting signal; and 

   playing back the audible reminder message in response to said 
acknowledgment.
