<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for determining and processing movement data of a rail vehicle, in particular relating to its position and speed, the said vehicle having a radio link to a satellite which transmits signals to a receiver located on the rail vehicle, these signals being input in a microprocessor or into a computer in order to calculate corresponding values. So that the movement data can be determined and calculated with sufficient accuracy in one overall system, it is proposed according to the invention that it should be possible to optimise the travel of the rail vehicle (1) by using algorithms, and that data relating to the movement dynamics of cranes (6) travelling ahead and/or behind be included in the control algorithm of a CPU (7) which is located either on the earth or in the satellite (2).

Apparatus for optimizing the travel of a rail
vehicle (1) having a microprocessor (9, 10, 13) which

is associated with the rail vehicle and which by way of
a receiver (5) of the rail vehicle (1) obtains signals

transmitted from a satellite (2) for the calculation of
the position and speed of the rail vehicle (1), and in

conjunction with a stored line map ascertains
appropriate values for the control of driving and

braking forces of the rail vehicle, 
characterized
in that
 data pertaining to the dynamics of
movement of trains travelling ahead and/or

following are included in an algorithm of a
central computer (7), and
in that
, moreover, travelling-resistance forces,
that are determined by way of the line map and the

current position of the rail vehicle (1) and

result from the line profile, the track geometry
and the line configuration, enter into the

ascertainment of the driving and braking forces,
and
in that
 a strategy proposal is laid before the
operator of the rail vehicle (1) by the central

computer (7), in which the respective current
position of the rail vehicle (1) is compared with

one that corresponds to the operation and as a
result of this the application of braking or

driving force or travel without braking and driving
force can be predetermined for the train's travel

by means of signals to a movement controller (14)
in the rail vehicle (1).
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterized in 
that
 the central computer (7) is located either on the
ground or in the satellite (2).
