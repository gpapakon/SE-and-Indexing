<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a procedure for transferring non-self-rolling interchangeable containers (1) between vehicles and/or storage stations conversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the interchangeable container (1) using a displacement device, the said procedure being characterised in that transfer devices (10) are moved out of a position of rest into an initial operating position. The said transfer devices (10) are moved as required over a support and are positioned under the interchangeable container (1), the interchangeable container (1) is raised perpendicularly with respect to the displacement device with lifting devices attached to the transfer devices (10), the interchangeable container (1) with the transfer devices (10) (engage with the underside of the interchangeable container (1) and produce an advancing movement by virtue of rolling or sliding friction parallel to the displacement direction) [sic] is transferred from the initial operating position into a final operating position in the displacement direction and the intermediate container (1) is deflected again in the final operating position, the transfer device (10) returning to the position of rest.

A transfer apparatus for transferring interchangeable containers 
which are not self-rolling between vehicles and/or storage stations with a 

direction of displacement transversely to the longitudinal axis of the 
interchangeable container, 


comprising transfer devices (10) which are movable from a rest 
position (R) into a starting operative position (B), 
on the transfer devices (10) lift devices (20) are actuable 
perpendicularly to the direction of displacement, 
wherein in the starting operative position (B) with lift devices 
actuated interchangeable container advance elements (30) on the transfer 

devices (10) are actuated, which by virtue of rolling or sliding friction 
in parallel relationship to the direction of displacement (V) produce an 

advance movement in the direction of displacement and transpose the 
transfer device (10) into a final operative position, and 
the lift devices (20) can be lowered in the final operative position, 
characterised in that the transfer device (10) has as interchangeable 

container advance elements (30) roller chains which circulate around at 
least two respective rollers (14, 16) arranged on a rigid roll frame, 
and the lift devices (20) are fixed to the roll frame and the lift 
devices (20) comprise at least two scissor-type lifters which are arranged 

symmetrically on the frame. 
Use of an interchangeable container upon transfer between vehicles 
and/or storage stations together with a transfer apparatus according to 

claim 1 characterised in that the interchangeable container has downwardly 
open openings which are fixedly disposed at its underside and which extend 

in the direction of displacement and in which the advance elements or the 
lift elements engage. 
Use according to claim 2 characterised in that the interchangeable 
container has downwardly open U-shaped rails as downwardly open openings.
