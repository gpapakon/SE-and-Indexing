<ABSTRACT>
An electric power steering apparatus having a 
compact and inexpensive backlash mechanism is provided 

by arranging its structure to easily adjust the 
backlash of the bevel gear mechanism, and at the same 

time, to pre-press the bearings (14,15) so that the movement of 
the shaft (3) in the axial direction can be regulated. The 

rotational shaft having a small gear (21) coupled thereto 
which constitutes a bevel gear mechanism on one side is 

rotatively supported by a housing (1), but disabled to 
shift in the axial direction. The large gear (13) which 

constitutes the bevel gear mechanism on the other side 
is coupled to the output shaft (3) of a steering system so 

that it can shift in the rotational direction and axial 
direction together with the shaft (3). The output shaft (3) is 

rotatively supported by bearings (14,15) with respect to the 
housing (1) with a movable sleeve (19) which abuts upon the 

outer ring (14a) of the bearing (14). The movable sleeve (19) can be 
driven in from the outside by means of an adjustment 

screw (16) so that the backlash between the small (21) and large 
gears (13) can be adjusted, while the inner ring (15b) of the 

bearing (15) can be driven in with respect to the output 
shaft by means of a lock nut (17) to tighten the bearing 

which abuts upon the outer ring of the output shaft (3). 
In this way, the inner rings of the bearings are 

pressed inwardly themselves, hence removing the play 
thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a power
steering apparatus.For vehicles and the like, there is known an
electric power steering apparatus which detects by
means of a torque sensor the steering torque generated
in the steering system, and outputs an auxiliary torque
to the steering system in accordance with the detected
value by driving an electric motor connected to the
steering system.Among such electric power steering apparatuses,
some of them are arranged to position the rotational
shaft of an electric motor in the direction at right angles
to the output shaft of the steering system due to the
limited space or the like for the motor to be
installed. In an electric power steering apparatus of
the kind, the rotational shaft of the electric motor
and the output shaft of the steering system are coupled
by use of a bevel gear or hypoid gear mechanism in
order to transmit the driving power while reducing the
speed.In the electric power steering apparatus described
above, one problem is encountered that the backlash 
must be set appropriately between the engaging gears in
the bevel gear or hypoid gear mechanism. If the
backlash is too small, the engaging gears are caused to
compete with each other. On the other hand, if the
backlash is too large, the surfaces of the engaging
gears are caused to collide with each other due to the
abrupt variation of torque. As a result, there is a
possibility that not only the hammering noises are
generated, but also, the teeth of the gears are damaged,
thus making it difficult to transmit the torque
smoothly.In the conventional technique, therefore, the
structure is designed for a gear mechanism of the kind
to adjust the backlash by installing the gears on one
side in the bevel gear or hypoid gear mechanism to a
shaft member, while supporting these gears by means of
bearings to make them correlatively movable with
respect to the gears on the other side by use of
spacers of a given thickness provided to intervene
between the shaft member and the bearings. However,
according to the structure thus designed, the assembly
is carried out by measuring the dimensions before the
assembly so that the backlash can be estimated or the
backlash must be measured once after the assembly in
order to make the adjustment by trial and error by
replacing spacers again. It takes a considerable time
and labor to execute these types of work. In the meantime, there is a structure disclosed in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application No. 4-5168
whereby to adjust the backlash in such a manner that
the gears
