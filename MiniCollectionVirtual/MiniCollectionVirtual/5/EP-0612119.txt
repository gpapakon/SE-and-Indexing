<ABSTRACT>
A motor car window (18) is provided, on one of its faces, with electrical conductors (19) which are printed on and baked into place. A prefabricated element (20) is bonded to this surface fitted with the conductors (19) and has a multilayer structure and comprises insulating layers and at least one electrical conductor (24, 25, 26) placed on an insulating layer. The prefabricated element (20) is placed on the conductors (19) baked into place. It is provided with a mounting surface (21) intended for an electronic module and with a mounting surface (22) intended for a plug for connecting to a miniature cable.

Car glazing having a system of conductors placed on a glass surface (1,
18) and comprising


a first series of conductors (2, 19), which are printed and baked in situ
on said glass surface (1, 18) an
d a second series of conductors, which are
printed and baked in situ on said glass surface or at least one electronic

module fixed to said glass surface,
crossing conductors (7, 24, 25, 26, 29, 32) placed in a different plane
from that of the conductors (2, 19) of the first series and constituted by

conductive, metal strips or wires permanently fixed by an adhesive coating
(13, 35) to said glass surface (1, 18) and which pass above the conductors

(2, 19) of the first series, whilst being electrically insulated from the
latter, 
characterized in that
the crossing conductors (7, 24, 25, 26, 29, 32) are used for electrically
connecting the conductors of the second series to a conductive, in situ

baked, terminal, connection system or are used for electrically connecting
the electronic module to a connection cable,
the crossing conductors (7, 24, 25, 26, 29, 32) are located within a
multilayer, prefabricated element (6, 20) comprising on the one hand an

insulating sheath (8, 34) surrounding said crossing conductors, at least in
the crossing region with the conductors (2, 19) of the first series and on

the other hand appropriate connection surfaces for the electrical connection
between the crossing conductors and the conductive, terminal, connection

structure and/or to the connection cable.
Car glazing according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the prefabricated
element (20) comprises metal, conductive strips or wires (24, 25, 26, 29, 32)

located in several planes and separated from one another by the interposing
of insulating layers (27).
Car glazing according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the metal
strips (24, 25, 26, 29, 32) have a thickness of 30 to 80 Âµm and a width of 1

to 10 mm.
Car glazing according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

the adhesive coating (13, 35) is based on isoprene or acrylate.
Car glazing according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in
that
 the prefabricated, multilayer element (6) is provided, at least at one
of its ends, with an eyelet (11) for the connection by tin welding to a

conductive layer (15) baked in situ on the glass surface. 
Car glazing according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that

the prefabricated, multilayer element (20) is provided, at one of its ends,
with a mounting surface (22) intended for a plugging element for connection

to a compact cable.
Car glazing according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that

the prefabricated, multilayer element (20) is provided, at one of its ends,
with a mounting surface (21) for the connection of an electronic module.
Car glazing according to one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that

the prefabricated, multilayer element (6, 20) is provided, at one of its
ends, with a plugging element integrated into the element (6, 20).
Car glazing according to one of the claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that

the prefabricated, multilayer element (20) is provided with an electronic
module integrated into the element (20).
Car glazing according to one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that

the prefabricated, multilayer element (6, 20) is implemented in the form of a
multilayer strip, flat cable.
