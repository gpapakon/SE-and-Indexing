<ABSTRACT>
A discharge regulator (20), in particular for a rainwater-retention tank (10), has a throttle device which is formed by a valve (30) which is controlled automatically in dependence on the filling height and has a throttle element which changes the outflow opening (21) of the retention tank (10). Said throttle element is designed as a flap (25) and is connected to springs (31,32) provided in the valve (30). In this arrangement, the flap (25) is pushed, by the respective water column pressure, against said springs (31,32), it being displaced into an approximately fully open position when the retention tank (10) is empty and, pushing against the springs (31,32) as the water column pressure increases, being displaced in the closing direction until, in the case of the maximum filling level, the outflow opening (21) is reduced to a minimum dimension. Preferably, the automatically controlled valve (30) is designed such that, with each filling level, an approximately constant amount of water flows out of the retention tank (10) per unit of time. This design, according to the invention, of the discharge regulator (20) achieves a solution which is extremely simple in terms of structure and in the case of which an optimum and very operationally reliable discharge of rainwater is ensured.

Discharge regulator especially for a rainwater-collecting reservoir, with at least
one throttle device on the discharge ofthe reservoir, which serves to achieve a reduced

discharge quantity per unit of time with increasing fill level of the rainwater in the
reservoir in comparison with a discharge without throttle device, wherein the throttle

device consists of an automatically controlled valve depending on the fill level (30, 50)
with a throttle element which alters the discharge opening (21) of the reservoir (10)

characterised by the fact that the throttle element in the form of a flap (25) or a plate
(52) is arranged in such a way that it is pressed in the direction of closure by the

pressure of the respective water column and that the throttle element also works
together with a spring element provided in the valve (30, 50) in such a way that when

the reservoir (10) is empty it is displaced into a roughly fully-open position and as the
pressure of the water column increases, moves against the spring element, pressing it

in the direction of closure.
Discharge regulator according to Claim 1, characterised by the fact that the
automatically controlled valve (30, 50) is designed in such a way that an approximately

constant quantity of water per unit of time is discharged from the reservoir (10) at any
fill level.
Discharge regulator according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised by the fact that
the valve (25, 52) or the plate (52) is displaced with increasing water column pressure

against the spring element in the direction of closure until at maximum fill level the
discharge opening (21) is reduced to a minimum size.
Discharge regulator according to Claim 3, characterised by the fact that the
spring element comprises several springs (31, 32, 56, 57, 58, 59), which are

dimensioned in such a way that the flap (25) or the plate (52) moves in the direction of
closure such that it decreases in proportion to the water column pressure for the

purpose of achieving a constant discharge quantity per unit of time.
Discharge regulator according to one of the claims 1 - 4, characterised by the
fact that the flap (25) is held pivotably to the side of the discharge opening (21) and

can be moved into the corresponding throttle position opposite the valve (30)
displaying four springs (31, 32).
Discharge regulator according to one of the claims 1 - 4, characterised by the
fact that the valve (50), its springs (56, 57, 58, 59) and the plate (52) connected with

these via a connecting element (63) are arranged concentrically to the discharge
opening (21).
Discharge regulator according to Claim 6, characterised by the fact that the
connecting element (63) on the front side (66) lying opposite the plate (52) is also

impinged upon by the water column pressure. 
Discharge regulator according to one of the preceding claims, characterised by
the fact that a device (40) for the fastening and releasing of the discharge regulator

(20) is provided on and by a discharge pipe (12) fitted in the reservoir (10), by means
of which this discharge regulator (20) can be fastened from outside the reservoir (10)

on this discharge pipe (12).
Discharge regulator according to Claim 8, characterised by the fact that the
device (40) demonstrates an erection rod (42) which can be coupled with it, and which

serves in the insertion and removal of the discharge regulator (20) and in the fixing of
the same on the discharge pipe (12).
Discharge regulator according to Claim 9, characterised by the fact that the
erection rod (42) demonstrates a coupling which can be actuated from its upper side

via an adjustment knob (41), with a coupling part (45) working together with the
device (40).
Discharge regulator according to Claim 8, 9 or 10, characterised by the fact
that a shaft (43) protrudes from the coupling part (45) of the device (40) through the

discharge regulator (20) and on both sides is provided with an externally-located fixing
element (46) which, by means of turning the erection rod (42) and thereby also the

coupling part, (45) engages with a retaining bolt (47) on the discharge pipe (12).
Discharge regulator according to Claim 11, characterised by the fact that the
fixing elements (46) each work together with the retaining bolt (47) in such a way that

when these are closed, in the manner of a knee lever effect, an elastic sealing ring (49)
between the discharge regulator (20) and the discharge pipe (12) is compressed and on

attaining the final position is then released slightly, while when both are released the
fixing element (46) is turned in the opposite direction via the erection rod (42) and

after a turn of approximately 90Â°, an external curved path (46') from it comes into
contact with the retaining bolt (47), and in this way the discharge regulator (20) is

forced away from the discharge pipe (12), thus guaranteeing a secure separation of the
two.
