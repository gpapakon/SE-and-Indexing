<ABSTRACT>
Process for continuous impregnation of absorbent dry webs, in particular those of paper, nonwoven or fabric, in which the web is loaded with impregnating liquid and is guided past a suction zone and, in so doing, the impregnating liquid is sucked through the web, characterised in that the suction zone is arranged in a suction roll, the roll peripheral speed of which is matched to the web speed, the suction roll rotating in a container of impregnating liquid and the web being deflected around this suction roll, a fixed suction zone being located in the interior of the suction roll in the deflection region in which the web rests on the suction roll, and the impregnating liquid level in the container being above the suction zone.

<CLAIMS>
Method for the continuous impregnation of 
absorbent dry webs (3), especially those made of paper, 

non-woven or fabric, in which the web (3) is loaded with 
impregnating liquid, guided past a suction zone (5) and, 

in so doing, the impregnating liquid is sucked through 
the web (3), characterized in that the suction zone (5) 

is arranged in a suction roll (2) whose roll peripheral 
speed is coordinated with the web speed, the suction roll 

(2) rotating in a container (1) of impregnating liquid 
and the web (3) being deflected around this suction roll 

(2), there being a stationary suction zone (5) inside the 
suction roll (2) in the deflection region in which the 

web (3) is against the suction roll (2), and the level of 
the impregnating liquid in the container (1) being above 

the suction zone (5). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the suction roll (2) runs so easily that the running 

web (3) deflected around it rotates the suction roll (2) 
at the same speed of its roll periphery as that at which 

the web (3) moves, without requiring an additional 
synchronization measure. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the rotation of the suction roll (2) is actively 

synchronized with the web speed. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that a surplus of impregnating liquid is subsequently 

removed in a squeezing station and optionally fed back 
into the container (1) with the impregnating liquid.
