<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting breast disorders 
administering to a human in need of treatment an 

effective amount of a compound having the formula 

   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine, hexamethyleneamino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
In the United States, one in every four women require 
medical attention for breast symptomatology. While much rarer, 
males also encounter breast disorders. Such disorders include 
galactorrhea, gynecomastia, hypertrophy, polythelia, 
mastodynia/mastalgia, hyperprolactinemia, and generally non-fibrocystic, 
non-cancerous mascopathias. Breast pain is common and estimated to be present in 
50% of women. Normally the etiology is unclear. The discomfort 
generally is classified as (1) cyclic mastalgia or mastodynia 
occurring immediately prior to the menses; (2) changes in the 
breast such as duct ectasia and sclerosing adenosis, or (3) 
referred pain such as costochondritis. Gynecomastia is enlargement of the glandular breast 
tissue in male humans (the female counterpart is hypertrophy). 
This enlargement is localized to the aureoles and can be 
unilateral or more commonly bilateral. The condition is usually 
benign in nature; however it can be the source of severe 
psychological disturbance to the patient. Gynecomastia is most 
commonly found in males at the time of puberty, but can occur at 
any age. Gynecomastia can have many underlying causes, e.g., 
Klinefelter's syndrome (XXY chromosomal abnormality), liver 
disorders, estrogen therapy for prostatic carcinoma, tumors of 
various endocrine organs, and certain drugs (digitalis and 
Dilantin). The common relationship between all these causes and 
the resulting gynecomastia is the production of abnormal amounts 
of estrogens. Currently, treatment of this disease is limited 
to three therapies: 1) Determination and treatment of the 
underlying cause. 2) Surgical removal of the breast tissue. 3) 
Treatment with diethylstilbestrol and radiation. Determination 
and treatment of the underlying cause of gynecomastia is not 
always possible. Surgery and treatment with diethylstilbestrol 
and radiation is not always successful and entails great expense 
and risk. Clearly, a more effective and safer therapy would be 
useful. Galactorrhea is the production of breast milk in the 
male or female when not immediately associated with pregnancy.  
 
The highly inappropriate and rare response in the male breast is 
accompanied by severe psychological discomfort to the male 
patient. It is thought to be caused by an overproduction of 
estrogen and prolactin excess. Surgical treatment is usually 
the therapy of choice if the underlying cause can not be 
determined or treated. A safer and less costly therapy would be 
useful. This invention provides methods for
