<ABSTRACT>
The present invention refers to elastic elements - springs - in a convenient form, produced by injection moulding, of plastic, non-metallic materials and their support, interconnection and reinforcement components configurating the "Framework" of a mattress or chair, totally made of plastic, replacing metallic wire springs. With the advantages of: manufacturing, assembling and their respective cost, lightweight, non-oxidation, the possibility of manufacturing all framework sizes with only one model.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to elastic elements and the respective components, 
which are manufactured by injection of plastic materials and are intended to form the 
structure of mattresses, chairs and similar objects. Most known mattresses are manufactured based on a framework of metal springs 
covered with an adhesive material, such as felt or jute. These traditional mattresses, by 
virtue of their composition, are heavy, noisy and liable to rust. In the manufacture of 
mattresses based on a framework of metal springs, there is also another problem which is 
difficult to resolve - the padding or lining next to the springs, usually felt or jute, so that 
the person using the mattress does not feel the hardness or unevenness of the wire springs. Attempts have also been made to manufacture mattresses based on synthetic 
elements instead of the traditional metal springs. Thus, there are some documents which describe new processes for manufacturing 
mattresses or similar objects. DE-A-2015659 describes a mattress or similar object 
manufactured with layers of springs containing elements which are connected to each 
other and which are made of synthetic material. NL-A-8502589 relates to support plates 
and springs. The present invention proposes a new frame or structure for a mattress or similar 
product that is efficient, lightweight, non-degradable by oxidation, is easy to manufacture 
and does not require specialised personnel to assemble it. This makes it possible to mass 
produce mattresses at a low cost. The fundamental basis of a mattress which defines its quality is its frame or 
structure. It is this base which makes the mattress or similar product a homogenous, solid 
and elastic whole capable of supporting the human body.  
 The present invention is essentially characterised by an elastic element of a suitable 
shape and dimensions, made of a suitable non-metallic plastic material, by injection, and 
support plates also made of a plastic material obtained by injection, allowing the 
aforementioned elastic element to be assembled in such a way that the whole can 
withstand compression. The resistance, flexibility and strength of this elastic element is identical to a 
conventional steel wire spring. The abovementioned characteristics of this new elastic 
element can be altered according to the type of plastic material used. The abovementioned elastic elements are suitably attached to an upper plate and a 
lower plate respectively, for example by fitting them together. Furthermore, the support

<CLAIMS>
Elastic element (1) and the respective upper and lower support plates (5,6), 
both elastic element and support plates being manufactured by injection moulding of 

plastic materials and intended to form structures or frames for mattresses or similar 
objects, characterised in that, said elastic element (1) consists of a single element 

comprising two parts, an upper part (2) and a lower part (3), each of which parts (2,3) has 
a flat area (4) in the shape of a flattened arch, through which area (4) the elastic element 

(1) is connected to said upper (5) and lower (6) support plates by appropriate means such 
as fixing pins, in order for the elastic element (1) to assume a working position 

substantially perpendicular to the plane of the support plates (5,6), the structure resulting 
from the elastic element (1) and associated support plates (5,6) being able to withstand 

compression, the elastic and resilient capabilities of the resulting structure being varied 
only by variation of the plastic materials utilised during the manufacturing process by 

injection moulding. 
Elastic element and the respective support plates according to claim 1 
whereby the abovementioned upper and lower parts may vary in width and/or thickness, 

in order to ensure different types of flexibility and resistance. 
Elastic element and the respective support plates according to claim 1 which 
may also have restrictors which limit their path, i.e. elements which limit the elastic 

deformation of the elastic element (1) in order to avoid excessive compression. 
Elastic element and the respective support plates according to claim 1, 
wherein the support plates (5, 6) comprise orifices that ventilate and air the structure and 

reduce the weight thereof. 
Elastic element and the respective support plates according to any of claims 
1 to 4, comprising connecting elements for interconnecting the support plates ,consisting 

of lugs (8) which protrude from the sides of the support plates and allow them to be 
connected to adjacent plates, these connecting elements either forming or not forming 

part of the plates and being fitted into place, either by welding or by glueing. 
Elastic element and the respective support plates according to claim 1, 
which, when assembled in accordance with any one of the previous claims with an  

 
appropriate number of elements and plates, form structures or frames for mattresses or 

similar objects, which have a parallel upper and a lower covering consisting of a suitable 
number of support plates, between which a suitable number of elastic elements are 

assembled depending on the desired flexibility and resistance.
