<ABSTRACT>
A new stable solid composition suitable for oral administration comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of selegiline is achieved by reducing the destabilizing effect of the conventional lubricant present in such compositions, magnesium stearate, either by replacing all or a substantial part of the magnesium stearate by other lubricants such as fatty acid esters and vegetable oils and/or by adding a pharmaceutically acceptable acid to the selegiline-containing tablets.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A new composition containing selegiline.The invention relates to a new stable composition suitable for oral administration comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of selegiline e.g. the hydrochloride.5 Selegiline ((-) N-(1-phenyl isopropyl)-N-methyl-N-propionyl amine) is aMAO-B inhibitor. It has been available for more than ten years as an anti- Parkinson's disease drug.The most common composition of selegiline is a tablet having the following main constituents: selegiline hydrochloride, a diluent e.g. lactose o and starch, a binder such as polyvinyl pyrrolidone and a lubricant, usually a stearic acid salt e.g. magnesium stearate (EP 146363, WO 90/019289).Australian Patent No. 71541/87 lists a large number of auxiliary agents useful in a synergic composition of selegiline and amantadine. Among these are mentioned vegetable oils (e.g. arachis oil, castor oil, olive oil, sesame oil, 5 cotton seed oil, corn oil, wheat germ oil, sunflower seed oil, cod liver oil , mono-, di-, and triglycerides of saturated fatty acids C12 to C-|8). The only solid composition described contains 0.1 kg of magnesium stearate to 0.75 kg of selegiline hydrochloride.European Patent No. 294 441 discloses a composition to prevent 0 seasicknes which comprises an active ingredient such as selegiline hydrochloride. The composition may contain an acceptable lubricating agent, such as stearic acid or a salt thereof, and may contain flavourants which are conventional additives of sweet industry, such as citric acid, tartaric acid and lactic acid. Example 1 describes pastilles weighing 1.3 g and containing 10 5 mg of selegiline hydrochloride, 7 mg of magnesium stearate and 13 mg tartaric acid.The invention relates to a new stable solid composition suitable for oral administration comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of selegiline e.g. selegiline hydrochloride. It was observed during long term o stability studies of different formulations of selegiline hydrochloride that tablets containing magnesium stearate are not stable. Under stressed conditions i.e. heat (60 °C) combined with humidity (relative humidity of 75 %), the instability increases i.e. the content of selegiline hydrochloride decreases. 

 The present invention overcomes the destabilizing effect of stearic acid salts by decreasing the amount of magnesium stearate below a certain level, e.g. by replacing all or a substantial part of the magnesium stearate with another lubricant such as a fatty acid ester, polyethylene glycol, colloidal

CLAIMS
1. A solid composition suitable for oral administration, comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of selegiline, and at least 0.1 weight percent of a lubricant based on the total weight of the composition characterized in that the total amount of stearic acid salts present is not more than 1 part by weight per 10 parts of the selegiline hydrochloride or equivalent amount of the other acid addition salt of selegiline. 0
2. The composition according to claim 1 in which the total amount of stearic acid salts present is not more than 1 part by weight per about 25 parts of selegiline hydrochloride or equivalent amount of the other acid addition salt of selegiline. 5
3. The composition of claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the lubricant is a fatty acid ester, polyethylene glycol or a vegetable oil.
4. The composition according to claim 3 characterized in that the o lubricant is a fatty acid ester.
5. The composition according to claim 4 characterized in that the fatty acid ester is a triglyceride ester of a saturated fatty acid.
5 6. The composition according to claim 5 characterized in that the ester is glyceryl tribehenate.
7. The composition according to claim 3 characterized in that the lubricant is a vegetable oil. 0
8. The composition according to claim 7 characterized in that the vegetable oil is cotton seed oil.
9. A solid composition suitable for oral administration, comprising a 5 pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of selegiline, and a lubricant, characterized in that it also comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable acid with the proviso that the lubricant is not magnesium stearate when the acid is tartaric acid. 


 10. The composition according to claim 9 characteri¬ ze d in that the acid is a di- or tri-basic organic acid up to 10 carbon atoms.
