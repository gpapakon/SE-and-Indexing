<ABSTRACT>
The process for the production of a flexographic printing plate proceeds from a plate blank having a base (polyester film) and a soft rubber composition (polymer) containing an increased concentration of photoinitiators which is arranged on the base. The film holding the motif to be printed is attached to the surface of the rubber composition in registration. In order to enable arrangement and installation with the aid of known installation rails using register pins and corresponding stamped holes, as known in offset or intaglio printing processes, the novel process operates as follows:   a) the rubber composition (1) is removed from the base (2) at the edges (3) intended for the fixing; b) the base is provided with register holes (4) in the region of these exposed edges and placed by means of these holes on register pins (5) of an installation rail (6); c) spacers (7) whose height corresponds to the height of the removed rubber composition are placed on the uncovered edges; d) the film (8) having corresponding register holes (9) is placed on the register pins; e) the exposure, washing and installation in the printing machine are then carried out in a conventional manner.   This enables production of the plate with accurate registration for a flexographic printing process. At the same time, precise installation in the printing machine is possible. This installation can be carried out as so-called "stress installation", i.e. the installation can be carried out under pressure, so that height tolerances can be compensated for. This further increases the print accuracy.
