<DESCRIPTION>
 SYNTHESIS OF HALOENONES AND ARYL OR ALKYL SUBSTITUTED ENONES OR ALKENESFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the field of synthetic organic chemistry. More particularly, the present invention involves alternative methods for synthesizing haloenones and haloalkenes, as well as for synthesizing alkyl and aryl substituted enones or alkenes, including tamoxifen and tamoxifen analogs, using haloenones or haloalkenes as starting or intermediate materials.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONPresent methods for synthesizing stereospecific aryl or alkyl substituted alkene or enone compounds, such as tamoxifen and tamoxifen analogs, suffer from problems such as relatively low overall yields, low specificity, lack of stereospecificity, and high cost of starting compounds. GB patent 1,013,907 discloses the synthesis of alkene derivatives according to the formulaR1R2N(CH2)nO-φ-CR3=CR4R5 ("φ" hereinafter stands for phenyl), wherein R1 and R2 are C,_6alkyl radicals; or wherein the -N-R1_R2 group is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic radical, where n is 2-6, R3 and R4 are aryl radicals, optionally substituted by one or more alkyl, alkoxy and/or dialkylamino-alkoxy radicals and/or one or more halogen atoms; and wherein R5 stands for an alkyl, alkenyl or aralkenyl radical . A process for synthesizing a compound according to the above formula is also disclosed including (1) dehydration of an alkanol derivative of formula R!R2N(CH2)n0-φ-R, wherein R is CR3(OH) CHR4R5 or CHR3C(OH)R4R5-Rebrovic and Koser, J. Orα. Chem. 49:4700-4702 (1984) disclose that various terminal alkynes are found to react with (hydroxy(tosyloxy) iodo)benzene (HTIB) in CHC13to give either aryl {β - (tosyloxy)vinyl) iodonium tosylates, or alkynylaryliodonium tosylates or a mixture thereof; however the HTIB is not disclosed, taught or suggested to function as a catalytic agent Miller and Al-Hassan, J. Org. Chem. 50:2121-2123 (1985) disclose a method for the stereospecific 

synthesis of (Z) -tamoxifen via carbomethylation of phenyl (trimethylsilyl) acetylene with diethylaluminum chloride-titanocene dichloride. However, such a synthetic scheme does not provide a commercially suitable method for synthesizing stereospecific tamoxifen for pharmaceutical preparation.Coe and Scriven, J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1:475-477 (1986) discloses the synthesis of tamoxifen by low valent titanium-mediated crossed coupling of substituted benzophenones according to the formula 4-RφC0φ, where φ is phenyl, R=MeO, C1CH2CH20, BrCH2CH20, CF3C6H40 ar.d Me2NCH2CH20, where the
