<ABSTRACT>
A scanning tunnel microscope is arranged by a combination 
of an optical microscope and a tunnel scanning 

unit. The scanning tunnel unit includes a probe held to 
be spaced apart from a samp
le placed on a sample table 
by a predetermined interval in an axial direction, and 

an actuator for axially moving the sample table and the 
probe to a tunnel region and relatively and three-dimensionally 

driving the sample table and the probe. 
An objective lens and the probe are arranged such that 

the axis of the probe of the scanning tunnel unit is 
aligned with an optical axis of the objective lens of 

the optical microscope. The sample and the probe are 
axially moved and brought into the tunnel region, and 

the sample is scanned in its surface direction while the 
sample and the probe are finely moved in the axial 

direction and a tunnel current is kept constant, thereby 
performing an STM observation of an observation surface 

of the sample. The objective lens of the optical 
microscope is axially moved to obtain an in-focus state, 

and the field of the STM observation surface is observed 
as an optical microscopic image through an eyepiece 

lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a scanning tunnel microscope (STM)
according to the preamble of claim 1 as well as a method for measuring the
surface of a sample using a scanning tunnel microscope according to the preamble
of claims 8 and 17 for causing a metal probe to come close
to an observation surface of a sample as much as
possible, e.g., 50 Å or less to detect and measure a
tunnel current flowing between the metal probe and the
sample, and imaging the tunnel current.Unlike a conventional microscope, the STM can
detect electrons constrained in a sample. In recent
years, the STM has received a great deal of attention
as a typical surface observation apparatus capable of
observing atomic alignment in a real space. The
principle of operation of such an STM will be described
below.A probe having a sharp tip comes close to a sample
surface by an z-direction actuator such that electron
clouds smeared out from the sample surface slightly
overlap each other, and a voltage (tunnel voltage) is
applied between the probe and the sample to cause a
tunnel current to flow from the probe to the sample.
The z-direction actuator is servo-controlled to keep
this tunnel current constant. At the same time, the
probe and the sample are relatively moved in a surface 
direction by an xy-direction actuator to perform
two-dimensional scanning. At this time, a servo voltage
applied to the z-direction actuator which servo-controls
the probe is read, and the read voltage is displayed as
an image, thereby observing the surface of the sample.
That is, the probe scans the sample surface. When a
scanning position reaches a step on the sample surface,
a tunnel current is increased. The probe is separated
from the sample by the z-direction actuator until the
tunnel current reaches a constant value (initial value).
Since this probe movement corresponds to the step on the
surface, this scanning operation is repeated to read
servo voltages, thereby obtaining a surface image of the
sample.The tunnel current JT is represented by the
following relation:
JT ∝ exp(-A·1/2·S)
where
   A: a constant
      : an average of work functions of the probe and
the sample
   S: a distance between the probe and the sampleThe tunnel current JT therefore changes in
accordance with a change in distance S with high
response, and a resolution of an atomic scale can be
obtained.As described above, the STM can obtain a surface
image of a substance with a high resolution. Unlike
a reciprocal lattice space image obtained by a method
such as electron beam
