<ABSTRACT>
A method for the flocculation of wastewater comprising a 
block copolymer having the formula: 


wherein E is a polymeric segment obtained from the polymerization 
of hydrophobic monomers, x when present is a nonionic monomer, 

y is a cationic monomer, R₁ and R₂ are the same or different 
and are H or a lower alkyl group from C₁ to C₃ and F is a 

salt of an ammonium cation. The block copolymer is added to the 
wastewater, particularly oily wastewater, to flocculate 

contaminants.

<DESCRIPTION>
Water soluble block copolymers containing water soluble
and water insoluble monomers prove useful as flocculants for
oily wastewater treatment.There is an increasing usage of water soluble polymers
and copolymers in wastewater treatment industries. These
compounds have shown desirable utility for the purpose of
flocculating contaminants from contaminated water.The efficacies of the polymers or copolymers used will
vary depending upon the type of monomers chosen to form the
polymer or copolymer, the molecular weight of the synthesized
molecule and, in the case of a copolymer, the placement of the
selected monomers on the backbone of the copolymer. It is the
latter characteristic that is the focus of the present invention. Copolymers may be synthesized without attention to the
distribution of the two base monomers along its backbone
resulting in a random distribution of these monomers. Synthesis
may be controlled, however, to form a copolymer having long
sequences of monomers, e.g. A and B, as follows:
This formation results in compounds referred to as block
copolymers.Block copolymers exhibit unique properties and as a
result are more desirable than random copolymers or a blend of
the two homopolymers synthesized from the respective monomers.
The industrial importance of block copolymers has increased
markedly in recent years for these reasons.The present invention relates to treatment of oily wastewater
utilizing water soluble block copolymers containing water soluble
and water insoluble monomers. These polymers provide effective
flocculation specifically for induced air flotation and dissolved
air flotation processes. U.S. Patent No. 5,182,331 teaches treatment of wastewater
utilizing a block copolymer containing a polymeric segment
obtained from polymerization of hydrophobic or water insoluble
monomers attached to a polymer chain obtained from polymerization
of one or more water soluble monomers.U.S. Patent No. 4,521,580 and 4,528,348 disclose a method
of using surfactants to solubilize water insoluble monomers such
as octyl acrylamide in order to copolymerize with acrylamide.U.S. Patent No. 4,906,716 discloses a process of
incorporating hydrophobic water insoluble monomers, such as alkyl
acrylamides which are solid at room temperature, with acrylamide
into a water soluble copolymer. The process involved heating the
hydrophobic water insoluble monomers to above their melting point.U.S. Patent No. 4,835,234 discloses hydrophobically associating
terpolymers containing acrylamide, cationic monomer and
wat
