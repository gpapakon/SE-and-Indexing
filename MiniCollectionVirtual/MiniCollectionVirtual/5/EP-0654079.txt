<ABSTRACT>
A stable reagent for the analysis of an analyte. The reagent includes an enzyme, a phenazine derivative, a tetrazolium salt, and a divalent metal salt to stabilize the reagent. Importantly, the inclusion of the divalent metal salt in the reagent stabilizes the phenazine derivative/tetrazolium salt system at pHs from about 5.5 to about 7.8, thereby permitting the optimal functioning of certain enzymes in the assay of an analyte. The reagent may be provided in solution form or may be incorporated into a film, a fabric mesh, a glass fiber matrix, or a paper matrix.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the chemical analysis of an
analyte by the formation of a colored indicator.A common way of indirectly measuring the amount of
analyte in a sample is to involve the analyte in a
sequence of reactions that lead to the generation of
color, wherein the intensity of the color generated is
proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. A
known method of performing this type of chemical assay
utilizes reagents that include a phenazine derivative and
a tetrazolium salt (the phenazine derivative/tetrazolium
salt system). The phenazine derivative/tetrazolium salt
system may be schematically depicted by the following
scheme for glucose analysis:
Further illustrations of the phenazine derivative/tetrazolium
salt system in chemical analysis may be found

and Self, U.S. Patent 4,598,042, issued July 1, 1986. JP-A 51 063 688 and US-A 4,427,771 disclose reagents comprising an enzyme, a
tetrazolium compound or salt, phenazine methosulphate and a bivalent metal salt
which is a magnesium salt. This magnesium salt functions only as an enzyme
cofactor.US-A 4,748,115 and US-A 4,946,776 describe compositions comprising a
tetrazolium salt and magnesium chloride. These references however are silent with
respect to the presence of a phenazine derivative.US-A 4,892,817 teaches a composition comprising a tetrazolium salt and a water-soluble
ferricyanide/ferrocyanide salt or manganate (VII)/manganate (IV)
combination. This reference also does not describe the presence of a phenazine
derivative. Preferred compositions contain no metal ions other than potassium or
sodium. A problem with the phenazine derivative/tetrazolium salt system is the
stability of the phenazine derivative
and the tetrazolium salt, particularly when the phenazine
derivative and tetrazolium salt are included in a single
reagent or a film at pHs above about 5.5. At pHs above
about 5.5, photochemical degradation of the phenazine
derivative and autoreduction of the tetrazolium salt
become significant and interfere with accurate and
precise correlation of formazan to the analyte being
measured. Because many assays involve the use of enzymes
that function best at pHs from about 5.5 to about 7.8, it
is
