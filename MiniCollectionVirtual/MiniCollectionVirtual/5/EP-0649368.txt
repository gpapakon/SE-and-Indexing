<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of preparing a homogeneous particle board having considerably increased strength and resistance against moisture as well as the use thereof.Particle boards have been produced for a very long time. Usually they serve their purpose in a very good way. However there is a problem with these known particle boards. Thus they are sensitive to moisture and swell easily in a moist environment. In addition the strength and the hardness are rather moderate..There is a need for particle boards having a better strength, resistance against moisture and surface hardness. For instance these particle boards are needed as a carrier for so-called laminate floorings. Usually these floorings consist of a particle board having a thin decorative thermosetting laminate glued to its upper side. A balanced laminate is usually glued to the lower side of the carrier to give a dimensionally stable and even flooring material.The carrier has usually a thickness of about 6-9 mm and the two laminate sheets a thickness of about 1 mm together. Accordingly the complete flooring material has a thickness of about 7-10 mm.The laminate coated particle board is sawn up into a number of flooring boards which are provided with groove and tenon in the long sides and the short sides.Bar patterns are very usual for such laminate floorings. The decorative thermosetting laminate is produced in the usual way. Usually you start with a base layer consisting of a number of paper sheeets impregnated with phenol-formaldehyde resin and a decor paper sheet impregnated with melamine-formaldehyde resin. Possible there is also an overlay of α-cellulose impregnated with melamine-formaldehyde resin. These sheets are bonded together to a laminate by pressing under heat and pressure.Due to the fact that it has not been possible before to produce particle boards with enough strength, resistance against moisture and surface hardness it has not been possible to make laminate floorings which can stand a long time use in a public environment. In such spaces the floors are usually exposed to a higher moisture charge and a greater mechanical strain.The surface hardness of the particle board is important for the resistance of the laminated floor against impression marks.A high bending strength and internal bond of the particle board are important for obtaining a strong and resistant laminate floor.Normally particle boards are manufactured by building up a mat of particles in several layers on a forming belt. Than the central layer
