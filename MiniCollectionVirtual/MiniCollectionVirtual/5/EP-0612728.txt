<ABSTRACT>
Anisomycin derivatives which are stable in the body and have 
strong cytotoxicity, as well as highly therapeutic anticancer 

agents, antifungal agents and antiprotozoan agents which contain 
them or their salts, are provided. The anisomycin derivatives are 

represented by the general Formula : 

wherein R is hydrogen or an acyl group of 1-18 carbon atoms, and X 
is either a carbamoyl group represented by 
the formula: 

-CONR¹R²
wherein R¹ and R² are each hydrogen, a linear or cyclic alkyl group 
of 1-6 carbon atoms which may have a substituent or a phenyl group 

which may have a substituent,
 

or an alkyl group represented by the formula: 

-CH₂R³
wherein R³ is hydrogen, an alkyl group of 1-6 carbon atoms or an 
alkoxy group of 1-6 carbon atoms which may have a substituent. 
The invention also provides an anticancer agent, an 
antifungal agent and an antiprotozoan agent containing such an 

anisomycin derivative.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel anisomycin derivatives 
and to anticancer agents, antifungal agents and antiprotozoan 
agents which contain these compounds as effective ingredients 
thereof. Anisomycin is an antibiotic having the structure 
shown below (Formula I), which is produced 
by actinomycetes, and it is known to have 
strong cytotoxic activity due to its inhibitory 
effect on protein synthesis (J. Biol. Chem., 
vol.242, p.3226, 1967). 
The application of anisomycin or derivatives thereof as 
anticancer agents, antifungal agents, antiprotozoan agents and the 
like has been attempted, and for example there is a description in 
Japanese Patent Application Laid Open No. 62-89659 regarding the 
anticancer effect of a 3- or 4-acyloxy substituted anisomycin. 
However, these derivatives have a low effect in vivo compared with 
their strong cytotoxic activity in vitro, and thus they have not 
been practical for use as medicines.  An object of the present invention is to provide 
novel anisomycin derivatives which may have strong 
antitumor activity in vivo. We the inventors of the present invention have carried out 
research with doubts about the reduced antitumor effect of anisomycin 
in vivo, and have discovered that anisomycin is extremely unstable 
in the blood and is rapidly hydrolyzed causing deacetylization 
thereof, by which it loses its activity. This instability has not 
been overcome even for the compounds described in the above 
mentioned publication. The present inventors have conducted much diligent research 
in order to overcome this problem, and as a result we have 
discovered that a compound represented by the general Formula II 
below in which the 3-acetyl ester group of anisomycin is converted 
to a carbamic ester or ether group and the 4-hydroxyl group is 
modified, is more stable in the blood in comparison with anisomycin 
and has a strong activity. 
In Formula II, R is a hydrogen atom or an acyl group having 
1 to 18 carbon atoms; and,
 
X is either a carbamoyl group of the formula: 
-CONR¹R²wherein each of R¹ and R² is a hydrogen atom, a linear or cyclic 
alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a phenyl group, wherein 
the alkyl group and/or the phenyl group are optionally substituted, 
or an alkyl group of the formula: 
-CH₂R³wherein R³ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon 
atoms, or an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, wherein the 
alkoxy group is optionally substituted. In the Formula II, the acyl group represented by R is a 
saturated or
