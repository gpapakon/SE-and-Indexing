<ABSTRACT>
Corrosion, scale-formation, or other deleterious 
processes are inhibited in an oil well by installing 

within the oil well (10) fluid-permeable elements, such 
as tubular filters (20), which comprise a suppressing 

material. Each filter (20) comprises two tubular filter 
screens (24) between which is a bed (26) of particles 

comprising suitable inhibitor material. The particles 
might for example be porous ceramic spheres impregnated 

with the inhibitor material. The inhibitor material 
gradually dissolves in the well fluids during operation, 

and may for example inhibit corrosion and/or scale 
formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for treating an
oil well so as to inhibit scale formation, corrosion
and/or other deleterious processes, and to an apparatus
for performing this method.For many oil wells the composition of the fluid or
fluids in or adjacent to the well is such that it is
beneficial to add to the fluid a material to inhibit
deleterious properties which the fluid would otherwise
exhibit. For example the fluids may be corrosive to the
well casing so a corrosion inhibitor would be added; the
fluids might form solid hydrates, or emulsions, for which
suitable inhibitors might be added; or the fluids might
form scale deposits, so a scale inhibitor would be added.
The principal constituents of scales are carbonates or
sulphates of calcium, barium or strontium, and such scale
materials may precipitate as a result of changes in
pressure or temperature of produced fluids, or when
connate water mixes with injected water during secondary
recovery operations. A variety of scale inhibitors are
known. However injected inhibitors do suffer some
disadvantages; and in the case of sloping or horizontal
wells the known techniques of injection are difficult to
apply successfully, partly because sand or other
sediments tend to collect on the lower side of the bore,
and because injected liquids flow into the rock strata
preferentially in the regions nearest to the well-head.The use of a corrosion inhibitor in solid form
enclosed within a porous cloth bag is described in US-A-760
584 (Rohrback). The inhibitor may be mixed with 
other materials and gradually dissolves into the well
fluids. There may be a stack of such bags, so that as
the inhibitor dissolves and the bags collapse, other bags
in the stack are exposed to the well fluids.According to the present invention there is provided
a method of treating an oil well so as to inhibit
deleterious processes, the method comprising (a) forming
a multiplicity of rounded beads of an insoluble porous
oxide or ceramic material with a porosity between 10% and
30%; (b) then causing a material to suppress the
deleterious processes to be precipitated within the
beads; and (c) then installing the beads as a fluid-permeable
bed within the oil well.In a preferred method the beads are installed within
a tubular filter. Such a filter may comprise two
generally coaxial tubular filter screens defining a
region between them, the region containing the fluid-permeable
bed of the beads. The beads may be bonded
together to form a coherent, permeable, tubular element,
in which case

<CLAIMS>
A method of treating an oil well (10) so as to
inhibit deleterious processes, the method comprising (a)

forming a multiplicity of rounded beads (42) of an
insoluble porous oxide or ceramic material with a porosity

between 10% and 30%; (b) then causing a material to
suppress the deleterious processes to be precipitated

within the beads (42); and (c) then installing the beads
(42) as a fluid-permeable bed within the oil well (10).
A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the
suppressing material is an inhibitor material, which

gradually dissolves into the well fluids during operation.
A method as claimed in Claim 2 wherein the inhibitor
material includes at least one material selected from

scale inhibitor and corrosion inhibitor.
A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein the inhibitor
is scale inhibitor and is precipitated within the beads

(42) in the presence of calcium ions.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding
Claims wherein the beads (42) are of silica- or alumina-based

material of size in the range 0.3 mm to 5 mm,
preferably between 0.5 and 2 mm.

Claims wherein the beads (42) are installed within a

tubular filter (20,30).
A method as claimed in Claim 6 wherein the filter
(20,30) comprises two generally coaxial tubular filter

screens (24,36,40) defining a region (26,38) between them, 
the region (26,38) containing the fluid-permeable bed of

the beads (42).
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims
wherein a tubular filter screen is installed within the oil

well, the method comprising injecting the beads into a gap
outside the filter screen.
A method as claimed in Claim 7 or Claim 8 wherein the
fluid-permeable bed contains different types of particles,

some of which do not incorporate any suppressing material.
A method as claimed in any one of the preceding Claims
wherein the beads are subjected to evacuation to remove any

fluids from the pores prior to being contacted by the
suppressing material.
A tubular filter (20,30) for use in the method as
claimed in Claim 6, comprising two generally coaxial

tubular filter screens (24,36,40) defining a region (26,38)
between them, the region containing a fluid-permeable bed

of the beads (42).

means (22) at each end for connection to another such

filter (20).
