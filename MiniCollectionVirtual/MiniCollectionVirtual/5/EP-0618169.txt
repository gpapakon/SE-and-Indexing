<ABSTRACT>
A padded element of a motor-vehicle seat is made 
applying a cover (1) onto a padding body (2) by 

pressing with simultaneous application of steam. The 
covering fabric (1) is provided on a lower mould (3) 

with the back side thereof facing upwardly and the 
padding body (2) is pressed against this back side by 

an upper mould (10). The upper mould (10) includes a 
plurality of cannulae (11) for steam injection, which 

project downwardly from the upper mould (10) and are 
introduced through the padding body (2) and have their 

steam outlet lower ends located inside this body (2) 
adjacent to the surface thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally refers to padded 
elements used in motor-vehicles, comprising a padding 
body, usually made of foamed plastic material, and a 
cover applied thereon. The invention particularly 
relates to a method and apparatus for manufacture of a 
padded element, particularly for a motor-vehicle seat, 
of the type wherein a cover is applied onto a padding 
body and the cover is formed according to the shape of 
the surface of the padding by pressing in a mould and 
simultaneous application of a flow of steam. The 
invention however applies also to other padded elements 
used in motor-vehicles, such as door panels, roof 
panels, dashboard panels. By the term "padded element" of a motor-vehicle seat, 
reference is made in the present description and in the 
following claims either to the seat portion or the 
backrest portion of the seat. This element is formed by 
a padding body, usually made of foamed plastic 
material, on which there is applied a cover (made of 
fabric, skin, or synthetic material) which may be 
provided on its back with a relatively thin and soft 
layer of foamed plastic material. According to the most conventional technique, the 
padding body of the seat element is covered with a  
 
fabric which is secured to the body of foamed plastic 
material by sewing or by means of an adhesive material 
or by fixing elements which connect the cover to the 
body of foamed plastic material. This last two 
techniques have the advantage, with respect to the most 
conventional technique which provides the sewing of the 
cover, to be more adapted to a gross production and to 
allow in particular the manufacturing process to be 
automated, while enabling the production of complex 
anatomical shapes, which answer to ergonomic and 
comfort needs. On the other hand, said known process 
imply the risk which following the connection of the 
covering fabric to the surface of the padding element, 
the fabric is torn, if it is not elastic. In order to solve this problem, it has been proposed to 
use a thermo-formable material for covering the padding 
of foamed plastic material. This fabric is initially 
heated and then formed according to the desired shape 
by cold pressing in a mould. The fabric formed thereby 
is then connected to the body of foamed plastic 
material. This known method however has the drawback of 
requiring the use of a thermo-formable fabric, which is 
of a relatively high cost, and to prevent the use of 
fabrics having decorative designs, since such designs 
are deformed

Method for manufacture of a padded element, 
particularly for a motor-vehicle seat, in which a cover 

(1) is applied on a padding body (2) and in which the 
cover (1) is formed according to the shape of the 

surface (5) of the padding by a pressing operation in a 
mould (3, 10) and simultaneous injection of a flow of 

steam, 

wherein the cover (1) is initially applied on a lower mould 
(3) with the back side thereof facing upwardly, and 
wherein the padding body (2) is pressed against the back side 
of said cover (1) by lowering onto the lower mould (3) 

an upper mould (10) on which said padding body (2) has 
been previously positioned, adhesive means (9) being 

interposed between said cover (1) and the padding body 
(2),
 
Characterized in that 
simultaneously with the pressing of the padding body 
(2) against the back side of the cover (1), steam is 

injected through cannula means (11) projecting 
downwardly from the upper mould (10), which are 

arranged through the padding body (2) and terminate 
inside this body, adjacent to the surface of the 

latter. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
during said steam injection operation, steam is taken  

 
from a reservoir of steam under pressure (15) located 

remote from said cannula means (11) in such a way 
however that it enables a heat transmission from the 

wall of said reservoir (15) to said cannula means (11). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said cover (1) is kept in tight contact with the lower 

mould (3) by applying a vacuum. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said cannula means (11) are arranged to hold said 

padding body (2) on the upper mould (10) when they are 
inserted through the padding body (2). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
said adhesive means (9) are constituted by a sheet of 

the "hot-melt" type to provide a reversible glueing of 
the cover. 
Apparatus for use in the manufacture of a padding 
element, particularly for a motor-vehicle seat, 

comprising a lower mould (3) and an upper mould (10) to 
provide forming of a cover (1) according to the shape 

of a padding body (2) and means for injecting steam in 
the pressing area during the pressing operation associated with the 

upper mould (10), 
characterised in that: 


said means for injecting steam 
comprise cannula means (11) 

projecting downwardly from the upper mould (10) and 
arranged to be inserted through the padding body (10) 

with the lower outlet ends terminating inside said padding body (2) 
adjacent to the surface (5) thereof. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that said cannula means (11) are connected to a 

reservoir of steam under pressure (15) by an 
intercepting valve (14), said reservoir (15) being 

remote from said cannula means (11), with an 
arrangement however which enables heat transmission 

from the wall of said reservoir (15) to the wall of 
said cannula means (11). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that the lower mould (3) has an upper wall (4) with 

holes (8) which can be connected to a vacuum source to 
suck the cover (1) against said wall (4). 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that a line of lower moulds (3) is provided, according 

to a linear or circular arrangement, a station to apply 
the padding bodies (2), comprising an upper mould (10), 

means for bringing the lower moulds (3) in sequence at 
said station.
