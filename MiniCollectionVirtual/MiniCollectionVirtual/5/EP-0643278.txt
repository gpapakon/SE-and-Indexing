<ABSTRACT>
An evaporator comprising a plurality of unit heat 
exchangers (A, B) each of which has a circuit formed 

therethrough for a heat exchanging medium and a connecting means 
(220, 230) for connecting the circuits in fluid communication with 

each other, each of the unit heat exchangers comprising a 
plurality of tubes (1) arranged in parallel with each other, a 

plurality of fins (2) each interposed between the two adjacent 
tubes (1) and a pair of hollow headers (3, 23 and 4, 24) to 

which both ends of each tube (1) are connected in fluid 
communication. The unit heat exchangers (A, B) are arranged 

fore and aft in a direction of air flow so that one of them faces 
windward, with the other lying leeward and unit air flow paths 

are defined between the adjacent tubes (1) and separated by the 
fins (2), such that a cross-sectional area of each unit air flow 

path in the leeward unit heat exchanger is larger than that in 
the windward one, whereby an amount of condensed water on the 

leeward unit heat exchanger is prevented from being scattered 
therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns an evaporator comprising a 
plurality of unit heat exchangers for use in car coolers. EP-0 401 752 discloses a condenser for a refrigerant of a 
vehicle air conditioning system having adjacent assemblies which 
are mechanically connected via their ribbed portion, the mean 
thermal conductance λ m lies, however, 20% below the thermal 
conductance λ of the material of the ribbed portion of the two 
adjacent assemblies in a connection zone between every two 
adjacent assemblies. US-A-3229760 comprises a heat exchange apparatus more 
particularly a radiator structure provided with cooling fins 
mounted in a main housing provided with a plurality of spaced 
apart fluid conduits and a guard structure being provided to 
protect the fins. US-A-4531574 provides a mounting for attaching an oil 
cooler to a radiator so as to be in series therewith in the path 
followed by the coolant air. A multi-flow type heat exchanger is disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication Kokai 63-34466 and has a structure such that a 
plurality of parallel flat tubes are connected to a pair of hollow 
headers at their opposite ends, respectively, with a corrugated 
fin interposed between one such flat tube and the next. In 
operation, heat exchange occurs between coolant and ambient air 
which flows through spaces defined between the tubes while the 
coolant flows through a coolant circuit composed of the flat 
tubes. The known multi-flow type heat exchanger can be made 
thinner than the other known heat exchangers in its dimension in 
a direction of air flow, without affecting the efficiency of heat 
exchange. Therefore, the multi-flow type heat exchanger has 
proved itself better in performance than the other known heat 
exchangers of some types such as the serpentine type. An object of the present invention is to provide an 
evaporator which is adapted to increase the heat transfer 
capacity thereof without necessitating an excessively wide space.  
 According to the present invention an evaporator comprises 
a plurality of unit heat exchangers, each of the unit heat 
exchangers having a circuit formed therethrough for a heat 
exchanging medium, and a connecting means for connecting the 
circuits in fluid communication with each other, each of the unit 
heat exchangers comprising a plurality of tubes arranged in 
parallel with each other, a plurality of fins each interposed 
between the two adjacent tubes and a pair of hollow headers to 
which both ends of each tube are connected in fluid 
communication,
