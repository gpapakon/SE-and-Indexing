<ABSTRACT>
A nozzle for a tub comprises a nozzle body (4) which can be inserted in a borehole in the tub and has a flange (14) in the region of the tub inner surface (12), as well as an insert element (24) which can be connected to the nozzle body (4). This nozzle is to be developed further such that it only has a minimal height in the region of the tub inner surface and permits high throughput of air. It is proposed that the insert element (24) have a smaller diameter (30) than the flange (14) of the nozzle body (4) and that the surface (34) of the insert element (24) essentially lie in the same plane as the surface (36) of the nozzle body (4). On its outer surface the insert element (24) has slots (46) which are directed radially inwards towards the longitudinal axis (2) which extend from the back (50) of the insert element (24) to the surface (34).
