<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for crushing and/or cutting material, 
which is provided with a frame having coupling means by which said frame 

can be coupled to the jib of an excavator or the like. A first jaw 
occupying a fixed position with respect to the frame during operation is 

connected to the frame, as is a second jaw cooperating with said first 
jaw. The second jaw is pivotable about a pivot pin with respect to the 

frame by means of a setting cylinder in a direction towards the first jaw 
and in a direction away from the first jaw. The first jaw is detachably 

connected to the frame by means of said pivot pin and a second pin located 
at some distance from said pivot pin, and the second jaw is detachably 

connected to the frame by means of said pivot pin and a pin coupling the 
second jaw to the setting cylinder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for crushing and/or
cutting material, said device being provided with a frame having
coupling means by which said frame can be coupled to the jib of an
excavator or the like, whilst a first jaw occupying a fixed position
with respect to the frame during operation is connected to the frame,
as is a second jaw coooperating with said first jaw, said second jaw
being pivotable about a pivot pin with respect to the frame by means
of a setting cylinder in a direction towards the first jaw and in a
direction away from the first jaw and wherein said first jaw is
detachably connected to the frame by means of said pivot pin and a
second pin located at some distance from said pivot pin, and the
second jaw is detachably connected to the frame by means of said pivot
pin and a pin coupling the second jaw to the setting cylinder.Such a device is known from EP-A-0 435 702. In said known
device both jaws are pivotable with respect to the frame whereby for
each jaw there has been provided a separate setting cylinder extending
substantially parallel to each other. Thereby it has been noted in
EP-A-0 435 702 that one of said cylinders could be replaced by a rigid
link so that the corresponding jaw will be stationary with respect to
the frame.Now according the invention said first jaw has been
provided with coupling means near said pivot pin, which coupling means
cooperate with coupling means secured to the frame so that said
coupling means may be hooked together in order to couple the jaws to
the frame and whereby said coupling means are constructed in such a
manner, that the jaws coupled to the frame by te coupling means are
pivotable relative to the frame at the location of the coupling means,
about a pivot axis extending parallel to the pivot pin.By using a construction of this kind it is possible to
exchange the jaws coupled to the frame, which are very well suited for
carrying out a particular activity, for jaws which are very well
suited for a different activity. Thus this device can be optimally
adapted for carrying out different activities, such as for example
crushing concrete, cutting iron sections and/or scrap iron, cutting
and splitting wood etc., by exchanging the jaws whilst using one and
the same device. Whilst using one and the same device it is thus only
necessary to purchase a number of different pairs of jaws for carrying
out different activities, which will involve a considerable saving in
comparison with purchasing a number of complete, mutually different
devices,
