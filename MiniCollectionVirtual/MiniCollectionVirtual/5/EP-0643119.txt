<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to trans-olefin 
compounds useful as an ingredient of liquid crystal 
composition, trans-olefin compounds useful as intermediate 
of pesticides, medical drugs, liquid crystal 
materials and the like, a process for producing those 
trans-olefin compounds, a liquid crystal composition 
containing the trans-olefin compound as an active 
ingredient, and a liquid crystal element using said 
liquid crystal composition. With the recent progress in information 
society, a variety of display devices are getting an 
increasing importance as one of machine interfaces. Of 
such displays, planar displays and particularly liquid 
crystal displays (LCD) have rapidly been distributed 
because of their small thickness, lightness in weight, 
low driving voltage, and small consumption of electric 
power. Among the liquid crystal elements represented 
by liquid crystal display, the matrix type liquid crystal 
elements large in the amount of information are classified 
into active matrix type and simple matrix type from  
 
the viewpoint of method of driving. In the active matrix type, thin-film transistors 
or diodes made of polysilicon, amorphous silicon 
or the like are set as non-linear elements by every image 
element. However, the active matrix type is complicated 
in the process of production and low in product yield, so 
that it is inferior from the viewpoint of enlargement of 
area, reduction of cost and enhancement of density. 
Thus, at the present time, the simple matrix type is 
advantageous over the active matrix type so far as price 
and productivity are taken into account. As the liquid crystal element of simple matrix 
type which is in practical use currently, those using TN 
type and STN type liquid crystals are predominant. The 
optical response of these elements utilizes orientation 
of the average liquid crystal molecular axis in a 
particular direction in an electric field, which is based 
on the dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal molecules. 
Accordingly, the limit of optical response speed of these 
elements is of milli-second order, which is insufficient 
in the light of the increasing amount of information of 
the current time. Although a variety of driving methods 
have so far been proposed with the aim of overcoming this 
difficulty, none of those proposals can give an essential 
solution to the problem, so that enlargement of capacity 
and enhancement of density are difficult to realize by 
those proposals. Further, these liquid crystals are so 
restricted in the
