<ABSTRACT>
A device for data exchange is specified, having a portable data carrier 1 and a fixed station 2, in which the data carrier 1 has an energy source 10, by means of which an oscillator 18 can be supplied. The latter generates, in the means for transmitting data and energy in the data carrier 1, preferably in a coil 20, a signal corresponding to that of the fixed station 2 in operation. By this means, the fixed station 2 does not need to be continuously in operation, but rather the data carrier 1 can actively begin a data exchange, to which the fixed station then reacts, preferably with a transmission of high-frequency energy, by means of which the data carrier can be switched over into passive operation.

<CLAIMS>
A data exchange system, including a fixed station (2) and a portable data
carrier (1) which are coupled to one another by means (20, 30) for establishing a wireless

connection for the transmission of high-frequency energy and data, the data carrier (1)
including at least an electric circuit (16) with a supply device (12) for generating the

operating voltage for the circuit (16) from the high-frequency energy received or from an
energy source, 
characterized in that
 the data carrier (1) is provided with an oscillator (18)
which can be operated as desired by the energy source (10), via a switch (28), and feeds the

means (20) in the data carrier (1) for the wireless connection during operation, that the
fixed station (2) includes means (36) for receiving high-frequency energy from the data

carrier (1) in order to start the transmission of high-frequency energy in the fixed station
(2), and that the data carrier includes detection means (14) which detect the power received

by the data carrier and subsequently initiate the switching of the oscillator (18) in the data
carrier, the data carrier then operating in the passive mode by means of the high-frequency

energy transmitted by the fixed station (2).
A data exchange system as claimed in Claim 1, in which the means for the
wireless connection include at least a pair of coils (20, 30), one coil (30) thereof being

arranged in the fixed station (2) whereas the other coil (20) is arranged in the data carrier
(1) and forms part of a resonant circuit (20, 22), 
characterized in that
 the resonant circuit
(20, 22) constitutes a frequency-determining part of the oscillator (18).
A data exchange system as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the
energy source (10) is a solar cell.
A data exchange system as claimed in one of the Claims 1 or 2,
characterized in that the energy source (10) can be recharged.
A data exchange system as claimed in Claim 4, including means in the data
carrier (1) which respond to the high-frequency energy received in order to switch over the 

supply device (12) to generating the operating voltage from the energy received,

characterized in that
 the detection means (14) apply, when a power value is exceeded, the
operating voltage from the supply device (12) to a supply output (15) for charging the

energy source (10).
A data exchange system as claimed in Claim 5, 
characterized in that
 the
energy source (10) can be connected as desired, via a switch (50), to the oscillator (18) or to

the supply output (15).
A data exchange system as claimed in Claim 6, 
characterized in that
 the
switch (50) can be controlled by the means (14) for detecting the power.
