<ABSTRACT>
A multi-stage telecommunications switching means, such as a "rotator", has 2
n
 input ports 
and 2
n
 output ports, 'n' being an integer greater than 1, and is formed from a number n x y
(n-1)
 of 
y x y switching elements where 'y' is an integer greater than 1 and the elements are arranged in n 

stages wherein each switching element within a stage x, where 'x' is an integer between 1 and n, 
changes state every y
(x-1)
 timeslots to provide switching only in the space domain. The switching 
elements may be electrical or optical devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telecommunications switching element referred to as
a "rotator" and described in patent applications nos. GB2258360, GB2258366, GB2258581 and
GB2258582.Tamg C-L et al: 'Fairness and Priority Implementation in Non-Blocking Copy Network',
Communications - Rising to the Heights, Denver, June 23-26,1991, vol. 2, 23 June 1991, pages
1002-1006, XP000269635, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers discloses non-blocking
copy networks where the copy process is normally achieved by first assigning incoming
packets a set of monotone address intervals which correspond to the output ports of a multi stage
interconnection network, and routing the packets through the network for replication. A new
analytical method is developed to evaluate the exact blocking probabilities of these networks.GB 2 258 582 describes an ATM telecommunications switch comprising a plurality of
parallel data switching planes and a parallel central plane, each plane having an equal number
of input ports and output ports and a central switching unit to switch each input port to any output
port. The switch further includes rotator means to connect each input port cyclically to each
timeslot of the central switching unit and a second rotator means to connect each timeslot of the
central switching unit cyclically to each output port.According to the present invention there is provided a multi-stage telecommunications
switching means according to claim 1 having 2n input and 2n output ports, where 'n' is an integer greater than 1, 
characterised by comprising a number n x y(n-1) of y x y switching elements where 'y' is an integer
greater than 1 arranged in n stages wherein each switching element within a stage x, where x is
an integer between 1 and n, changes state every y(x-1) timeslots to provide switching only in the
space domain.Further there is provided a multi-stage telecommunications switching means as above,
having 2n inputs and 2n outputs, and wherein y is equal to 2, whereby there are n x 2(n-1) switching
elements arranged in 'n' stages and each switching element within a stage 'x', where x is an integer
between 1 and n inclusive, changes state every 2(x-1) timeslots.Further there is provided a processing means as in
claim 5.The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the
accompanying drawings, in which:-
Figure 1 shows a rotator input channel map;Figure 2 shows a rotator output channel map;Figure 3(a) shows a basic 2 x 2 switching device;Figure 3(b) shows
