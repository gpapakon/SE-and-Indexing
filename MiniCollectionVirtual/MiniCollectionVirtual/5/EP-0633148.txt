<ABSTRACT>
Cam-operated cover (lid) for a paint can equipped with a seal clamped over the upper part of the can by means of cams controlled by levers, at least the said crown being lined on the inside with a friction-sensitive material, characterised in that each cam is connected to each control lever by a spindle, a spring being connected to the said spindle in order to cause it to slide in the direction in which the cam is clamped against the crown (3), causing the seal (7) of the cover to be pressed against a rim (6) of the said crown; means are provided for holding each cam at a distance from the bearing surface (5) of the crown (3) so that the said cams apply only a compressive force, without friction, to the friction-sensitive lining.

A cam-operated cover for closing a paint can and similar
purposes, in which the cover (8) is provided, on its

underside, with a seal (A) clamped on an edge (6) of a rim
(3) bordering the upper portion of the can (1) by means of

pivoting cams (16) placed underneath said cover and
controlled by levers (17) placed above the cover, at least

said rim (3) being coated inside with a friction sensitive
material, each cam (16) is further connected to each of the

control levers (17) via a spindle (20), and a spring (28) is
mounted on said spindle (20) for biasing it to slide in the

direction for which the cam (16) is clamped against the
bearing surface (5) of the rim (3) by making the seal (7) of

the cover to be pressed against the edge (6) of said rim,
characterized in that means (26) are provided for

maintaining each cam (16) at a distance from the bearing
surface (5) of the rim (3) in any position of said cams

except a position for which said cams extend outwardly from
the cover, said means for maintaining said cams at a

distance from the bearing surface (5) of the rim (3)
comprising a ring (26) protruding from the inside of the

cover, and in that said ring (26) has a notch (27) extending
radially with respect to the cover, whereby said cams apply

to said friction sensitive coating only a compression force
when they are in the closing position of the cover. 
Cover according to claim 1, characterized in that the
top of each cam in vault or wedge shaped for bearing against

the bearing surface (5) of the rim (3) only after having
been engaged in the notch (27).
Cover according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterized
in that the spring (28) mounted on the spindle (20) of each

cam is placed for maintaining the top of the cam applied on
the ring (26).
Cover according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the spring (28) is interposed between a boss (18a)

protruding from the cover (8) and the bottom (22a) of a
sleeve (22) formed integrally with the lever (17) that

actuates the spindle (20).
Cover according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized
in that the seal (7) of the cover is a flat seal (7) that

bears on the edge (6) of a can of varying diameter, and in
that the cams have a length so as to compensate the varying

diameter of the bearing surface (5).
