<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an internal combustion engine with double intake ports (6) provided in a cylinder head (1), which can be divided by a rotary slide valve (10) into a primary port (1) and a secondary port (9) without the rotary slide valve (10) causing flow resistances or swirling in the double intake port (6), as a result of which the charge cycle can be optimally adjusted to the operating condition of the internal combustion engine.

Internal combustion engine with in each case a double 
inlet channel (6) provided in a cylinder head (1) for gas 

to be supplied to a cylinder chamber, which communicates 
with an intake pipe (14) and which is divided into a 

primary channel (8) and a secondary channel (9) by a 
separating element in the region of two inlet openings (4, 

5) which are opened or closed in controlled fashion by 
inlet valves (2, 3), wherein in each double inlet channel 

(6) or in the intake pipe (14) in the region of the 
connection with the double inlet channel (6) are arranged 

means for controlled distribution of the gas to be supplied 
to each cylinder chamber to the respective primary channel 

(8) or secondary channel (9), characterised in that the 
cross-sectional area of each double inlet channel (6) is 

approximately constant over its length, each double inlet 
channel (6) is associated with the inlet openings (4, 5) in 

such a way that approximately the same flow conditions 
occur at the two inlet openings (4, 5) and in that in each 

double inlet channel (6) is arranged a rotary roller slide 
valve (10; 22) which in an open position opens towards the 

centre of the double inlet channel (6) and in certain 
regions simulates the walls of the respective double inlet 

channel (6) without substantially influencing the flow 
conditions in the double inlet channel (6) in the process, 

and which by rotation about an axis (11) lying more or less 
in the direction of flow can be transferred to a closed 

position in which it divides the double inlet channel (6) 
over nearly its whole length into the primary channel (8) 

and the secondary channel (9), wherein the secondary 
channel (9) can be opened or closed towards the intake pipe 

(14) by a closure element. 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double 
inlet channel (6) for gas to be supplied to a cylinder 

chamber according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
rotary roller slide valve (10; 22) consists of a thinwalled  

 
cylinder section of which the cross-sectional area 

is defined by two arc sections with the same centre, 

wherein the axis (11) of the rotary roller slide valve (10; 
22) passes through this centre. 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double 
inlet channel (6) for gas to be supplied to a cylinder 

chamber according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
the rotary roller slide valve (10; 22) contains a partition 

wall in its region facing towards the inlet openings (4, 
5). 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double 
inlet channel (6) for gas to be supplied to a cylinder 

chamber according to one or more of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the closure element is a flat slide 

valve (15, 23) by which the secondary channel (9) defined 
by the walls of the double inlet channel (6) and by the 

rotary roller slide valve (10; 22) can be completely closed 
off from the intake pipe (14) and by which the double inlet 

channel (6) can be completely opened towards the intake 
pipe (14), which takes place by transverse displacement 

relative to the double inlet channel (10; 22). 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double 
inlet channel (6) for gas to be supplied to a cylinder 

chamber according to one or more of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that rotation of the rotary roller slide 

valve (10; 22) about its axis (11) and movement of the flat 
slide valve (15, 23) take place by actions of actuating 

means, as a function of operating characteristic values of 
the engine and/or of characteristic values of the vehicle. 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double 
inlet channel (6) for gas to be supplied to a cylinder 

chamber according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the flat slide valve (15) is  

 
connected to the rotary roller slide valve (10) rigidly, 

forming a structural unit, or by gearing techniques by the 
actuating means (16), and at the same time as rotation of 

the rotary roller slide valve (10) about its axis (11) is 
slidable relative to the double inlet channel (6). 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double 
inlet channel (6) for gas to be supplied to a cylinder 

chamber according to claim 6, characterised in that the 
actuating means (16) contain a servo motor which is 

connected by gearing techniques to the flat slide valve 
(15) and/or the rotary roller slide valve (10), and by 

whose force rotation of the rotary roller slide valve (10) 
and displacement of the flat slide valve (15) take place 

when signals controlling the servo motor signal certain 
operating conditions of the engine and/or certain 

characteristic values of the vehicle. 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double

chamber according to one or more of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the rotary roller slide valve (22) 

and the flat slide valve (23) are coupled to actuating 
means which can be driven independently of each other and 

hence closure of the secondary channel (9) by the flat 
slide valve (23) takes place simultaneously or non-simultaneously 

with division of the double inlet channel 
(6) into the primary channel (8) and the secondary channel 

(9) by the rotary roller slide valve (22). 
Internal combustion engine with in each case a double
