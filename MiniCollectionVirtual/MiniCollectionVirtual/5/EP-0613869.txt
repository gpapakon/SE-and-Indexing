<ABSTRACT>
Ceramic products consisting principally of cordierite 
and a method for making them are provided, the method 

employing batches comprising a mineral component and a 
chemical component, the mineral component comprising clay 

and talc and the chemical component consisting essentially 
of a combination of the powdered oxides, hydroxides, or 

hydrous oxides of magnesium, aluminum and silicon. 
Ceramics made by extrusion and firing of the batches can 

exhibit low porosity, high strength and low thermal 
expansion coefficients.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to cordierite ceramics, 
and more particularly to cordierite ceramics produced by 
the firing of chemically modified mineral batches for such 
ceramics. The production of cordierite (2MgO-2Al2O3-5SiO2) 
ceramics from mineral batches containing mineral sources of 
magnesia, alumina, and silica such as clay and talc is well 
known. Such processes are described, for example, in 
US-A-2,864,919. The manufacture of thermal-shock-resistant 
cordierite honeycomb ceramics from clay/talc 
batches by extruding the batches and firing the extrudate 
to provide ceramics with very low thermal expansion 
coefficients along at least one axis, is disclosed in US-A-3,885,977. The selection of mineral batch materials to be used in 
the production of cordierite ceramics by extrusion has been 
found to significantly affect the final properties of the 
resulting ceramics. For example, US-A-4,280,845 
describes the effects of varying the particle size and 
porosity of talc on the thermal shock resistance and 
porosity of the resulting cordierite ceramics. It has been proposed to utilize extruded honeycomb 
materials composed of cordierite in rotary heat exchangers 
(regenerators) for gas turbine and other heat engines. 
For best performance as a regenerator, high strength in 
combination with low porosity and high thermal shock  
 
resistance are required. US-A-4,877,670 and US-A-5,030,398 
describe cordierite ceramics exhibiting improved 
characteristics for these applications, produced by 
utilizing mineral (talc and clay) batch components of small 
and carefully defined particle sizes. The products 
provided in accordance with these patents reportedly 
exhibit thermal expansion coefficients (CTE values) in the 
5-12x10-7/° C range, typically with total porosities of 25-35 
volume percent. While such ceramics represent an improvement in 
properties over extruded cordierite ceramics produced using 
more conventional mineral sources, still further 
improvements in these products, particularly with respect 
to thermal expansion, porosity and strength, would be 
desirable. This is because heat regenerators and other 
components exposed to continuous heating and cooling in 
normal use must exhibit exceptionally high thermal 
durability in order to ensure that reasonable service life 
will be attained. One of the problems with existing extruded cordierite 
ceramics is that they exhibit only limited thermal 
durability under repeated thermal cycling. Hence, when 
thermally cycled within and above the
