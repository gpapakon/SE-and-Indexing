<ABSTRACT>
There is mentioned a device in an instrument for cleaning within the oral cavity, comprising a handle (16) and a means for cleaning within the oral cavity on the one end of the handle (16). The device is characterised in that the means (12) comprises a first side surface (28) provided with upwardly projecting bristles (26), and a second side surface (30) defining a scraping edge. According to one embodiment the elongate edge (36), which is defined between/by the belly surface (32) and the second side surface (30), forms the scraping edge (36) of the instrument. According to another embodiment the scraping edge is defined by a ridge (37) formed at the second side surface (30), said ridge being elevated upwardly from said surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device in an
instrument for cleaning of the oral cavity as will be
evident from the introduction of the following claim 1.
Thus the invention relates to a cleaning instrument which
comprises a handle element and a cleaning member connected
to this comprising a scraping edge and a bristle portion.With the present invention the aim is to alleviate
the problem which many people have with bad breath.The oral cavity (cavum oris) consists of teeth,
cheeks, soft palate, tongue, mouth floor, transition folds
and cheek mucous membranes. All these components can
collect bacteria/-plaque, food residues and dead skin
cells. With toothless people the roof of the mouth/the
palate and floor of the mouth including the lower jaw
(mandibula) can be a deposit for this collection of
material. Several investigations have shown that thorough
cleaning of the tongue and particularly its rear portions
will reduce the afore-mentioned frequency of bad breath,
that will increase the sense of taste and have the effect
of refreshing the oral cavity. Thorough cleaning of the
teeth is normal to-day in the population, but large
geographical and social variations exist. Concerning other
cleaning of the oral cavity then the western world is
to-day little focussed on other than the brushing of teeth
and interdental cleaning with tooth floss and tooth picks. 
The phenomenon of bad breathe can stem from the
afore-mentioned conditions, but a series of research
workers have published investigations where the main
problem is the rear portions of the tongue. As regards
persons without teeth collections of dead skin cells,
fungi and bacteria will not only occur in the prosthesis
itself, but also in cheeks and portions of the palate. It
is also known that dead skin cells in the mucous embranes
can influence the aroma of the air from exhalation.A series of instruments are known for the removal of
accumulations of odour-forming material on the tongue, and
reference shall be made here to GB-patent specifications
2.027.347, 2,234,903, 2.260.905 and 2.265.831. These
patent specifications show a U-shaped bow which comprises
a scraping edge and two handles which the user grips on,
after which he can scrape the tongue with the scraping
edge of the bow. However this scraping does not give a
sufficient cleaning of the tongue and there is no
discussion either of cleaning portions of the oral cavity
as is mentioned above. In addition a cleaning instrument
is known from US patent specification 1.891.864 which
comprises a
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Device in an instrument for cleaning within the oral
cavity, especially the tongue, comprising a handle element

(16) and connected to this a cleaning member (12), the
cleaning member being formed by a substantially straight or

slightly arcuate, or U-shaped, bow, thus defining a belly
side (32) and a back side (34), and comprising a first side

surface having two or more rows of upwardly projecting
bristles (26) installed in the first side surface (28), and

the cleaning member (12) comprising a scraping edge (36,37),

characterised in that
 the first side surface (28) and a second
side surface (30) of the cleaning member head portion (12)

respectively, form convex surfaces resulting in an
approximately cigar-shaped head portion and the second side

surface (30) defining the scraping edge (36,37).
Device in accordance with claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 the bristles (26) have a height of up to 8 mm
(millimetres), preferably about 3 mm.
Device in accordance with claim 1 - 2, 
characterised
in that
 bundles of bristles are utilised of dissimilar
hardness.
Device in accordance with any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the first side surface (28) comprises
regions without bristles (26).
Device in accordance with any of the preceding claims,

characterised in that
 the scarping edge is defined by a
ridge (37) formed at the second side surface (30) and of an

extension of the belly side (32), said ridge (37) being
elevated upwardly from the second side surface (30) and

extends along the arcuate shape of the bow. 
Device in accordance with claim 5, 
characterised in
that
 the ridge top edge being rounded in order not to
effect cut injuries in the tongue in use.
Device in accordance with claim 5-6, 
characterised in
that
 the ridge is elevated from the second surface in a
range of approximately 1-3 millimetres.
