<ABSTRACT>
The device for magnetising or demagnetising a metal product (1) in relative movement along an axial direction (2) includes:   - at least one set (3) of magnetising sources (4) distributed along the axial direction in proximity to a region (6) through which the product will pass, each magnetising source (4) comprising at least one electrical conductor fed with direct current, and configured to generate, in the region through which the product will pass, a magnetic field (B) of predetermined strength and of constant predetermined direction, two successive magnetising sources of the same set being configured in such a way that the respective magnetic fields generated by these magnetising sources are of different orientation, sense and/or strength, - and movement means for continuously moving the said product with respect to the magnetising sources along the said axial direction,   the number of these magnetising sources, and their distribution along the axial direction, being such that, when the product is moving past, any point on the surface of the product is subjected to a field of variable direction, strength and/or sense. Application particularly to the demagnetisation of a steelmaking object or product, or to the magnetisation required for magnetoscopic checks.
