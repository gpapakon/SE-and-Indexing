<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for decreasing the content of triglycerides in egg yolk and in egg yolk-containing products, which is characterised in that     a) egg yolk is diluted with water or an aqueous salt solution,   b) at least one cyclodextrin is added to this solution, c) the cyclodextrin/triglyceride complex is separated off from this mixture and d) the added water or the added salt solution is separated off to the respective desired extent from the egg yolk thus treated.

Process for reducing the content of triglycerides 
in egg yolk and in products containing egg yolk, 

characterized in that 

a) egg yolk is diluted with water or an aqueous 
salt solution, 
b) at least one cyclodextrin is added to this 
solution, 
c) the cyclodextrin/triglyceride complex is 
separated off from this mixture and 
d) the added water or the added salt solution is 
separated off to the respective desired extent 

from the egg yolk thus treated. 
Process for reducing the content of mixed 
glycerol esters containing saturated fatty acids in egg 

yolk and in products containing egg yolk, characterized 
in that 


a) egg yolk is diluted with water or an aqueous 
salt solution, 
b) at least one cyclodextrin is added to this 
solution, 
c) the cyclodextrin/triglyceride complex is 
separated off from this mixture and 
d) the added water or the added salt solution is 
separated off to the respective desired extent 

from the egg yolk thus treated. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the egg yolk is diluted with water or an aqueous 

salt solution in the ratio 1:1 to 1:6, based on the egg 
yolk weight used, and the cyclodextrin is added in an 

amount greater than 3 % by weight. 
Process according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the aqueous salt solution used is 

a solution of salts which decompose into volatile 
components on heating. 
Process according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the cyclodextrin used is β- and/or 

γ-cyclodextrin.  
 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that β-cyclodextrin is used in an amount of up to 80 % by 

weight and/or γ-cyclodextrin is used in an amount of up 
to 120 % by weight. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that β-cyclodextrin is used in an amount of 70 to 80 % by 

weight. 
Process according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that γ-cyclodextrin is used in an amount of 90 to 120 % 

by weight.
