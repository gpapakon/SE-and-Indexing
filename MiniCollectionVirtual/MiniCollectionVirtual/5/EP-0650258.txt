<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a driver circuit for generating a switching voltage, particularly a negative switching voltage which is suitable for GaAs technology. In this arrangement, FETs are used, the electrical characteristics of which can be spread within a wide range, and ohmic resistors which do not need to be calibrated subsequently. The driver circuit is particularly suitable for driving RF components.

Drive circuit for producing a switching voltage, wherein

a semiconductor amplifier, which converts an input signal into an output signal, is
present and
for the output signal the associated output voltage is so regulated by a
temperature-compensating circuit that temperature fluctuations have no undesired

influence on the output voltage, characterised in that
at least three field effect transistors (A3, A4, A5) are present which have the same
conductance type and are characterised by an actual cut-off voltage (U
p
),
the actual cut-off voltage (U
p
) is measured by a source-follower circuit (A5, R7 to
R10), consisting of the third field effect transistor (A5),

the drain (D5) of which is connected to one pole (M) of a voltage source (SP),
the voltage source (S5) of which is connected with an end terminal of a resistive

source voltage divider (R7, R8), wherein the other end terminal of the source
voltage divider (R7, R8) is connected to the other pole (-) of the voltage source

(SP) and

the gate (G5) of which is connected to the centre terminal of a resistive gate
voltage divider (R9, R10), the end terminals of which are connected to the poles

(-, M) of the voltage source (SP) and which produces at the gate (G5) a voltage
corresponding with the nominal cut-off voltage of the field effect transistors (A3, A4,

A5),
the first field effect transistor (A3) is connected by source (S3) with the centre
terminal of the source voltage divider (R7, R8) in such a manner that a source

voltage (U
s3
) corresponding with the actual cut-off voltage arises at source (S3) of
the first field effect transistor (A3),

lies by drain (D3) at the one pole (M) of the voltage source (SP) by way of the
second field effect transistor (A4), which is connected as a non-linear resistance

and the gate (G4) and source (S4) of which are connected with one another and
with the drain (D3) of the first field effect transistor (A3), and

is connected by gate (G3) with the other pole (-) of the voltage source (SP) by way
of a resistive impedance (R3), the input signal (U2) being additionally connectible

with the gate (G3) by way of a further resistive impedance (R2) and the resistive
impedances (R2, R3) forming an input divider for the input signal (U2), and 
drain (D3) of the first field effect transistor (A3) is connected with a terminal (P2), at
which, referred to the one pole (M) of the voltage source (SP), the output signal

(U
s1
) can be tapped.
Driver circuit according to claim 1, characterised in that the associated saturation
currents (I
dss
) for the first and the third field effect transistors (A3, A5) are substantially
greater than the saturation current of the second field effect transistor (A4).
Driver circuit according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in that in addition an
inverter stage (A6 to A8, R11, R12) is present, the input (G6) of which is connected with

the non-inverting output (P2) and at the inverting output (P3) of which an output signal
(U
s2
), which is inverted with respect to the output signal (U
s1
), can be tapped.
Driver circuit according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
inverter stage is connected with the source voltage divider (R7, R8) and is controlled in

correspondence with the cut-off voltage (U
p
) measured there.
Driver circuit according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that a level
converter, which includes a constant current source (A1, A2), is connected upstream of the

resistive input divider (R2, R3).
Driver circuit according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that merely
a single voltage source (SP) is present.
Driver circuit according to one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the
field effect transistors (A1 to A8) used have the same conductance type and are produced

in the same manufacturing process and thereby have production tolerances characterising
this.
