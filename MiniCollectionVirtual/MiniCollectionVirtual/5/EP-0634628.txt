<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates in particular to a method for monitoring land available for agriculture. In this case, the cultivated areas are accurately, quickly and cost-efficiently evaluated with the aid of aerial pictures and a downstream data-processing system in a versatile manner. The invention also relates to an arrangement for carrying out the method.

<CLAIMS>
Method of monitoring areas located on the earth surface, especially agriculturally
usable areas, through evaluation of at least one aerial image which is generated by means

of a camera and which is produced from a predetermined region in predeterminable scale
of reproduction, wherein


the aerial image is converted into a digitalised form and read into a data processing
apparatus,
an orthographic representation is generated from the digitalised form as
predeterminable cartographic representation,
at least one area is selected in the orthographic representation and the surface
area is determined of this area,

characterised thereby

that for the aerial image, in which the selected area is contained, a height model is
ascertained, read into the data processing apparatus in digital form and stored

there,
that from the digitalised aerial image at least for the selected area the associated
orthographic image is computed by means of the digitalised height model as well

as a transformation matrix containing the positional parameters, which determine
the aerial image, of the camera,
that in the computed orthographic image for the selected area at the edge region
thereof a reference cross-section, which is typical for the edge region by virtue of

the brightness and/or contrast and/or colour difference present there, is selected,
that in the computed orthographic image starting from the reference cross-section
and in accordance with the scale thereof the selected area is rounded off at its

edge region so that a closed boundary line surrounding the area arises and 
that in the completed orthographic image the surface area, which is established by
the boundary line, of the selected area is ascertained.
Method according to claim 1, characterised thereby that on a topographic map,
which is used as an identification map, initially an area of which the area parameters are to

be determined is marked and that according to the scale of the identification map at least
one aerial image which contains the area is created on a colour film.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that the
aerial image is created with the aid of an aircraft, the flight path of which is determined by

satellite navigation.
Method according to one of the preceding claims, characterised thereby that the
height model is created with the aid of a radar and/or laser scanning of the terrain

containing the area.
Method according to one of the preceding claims 2 to 4, characterised thereby that
the identification map is created on the basis of a satellite survey and/or aerial images that

are present.
Method according to one of the preceding claims 2 to 5 characterised thereby that
the identification map is digitalised and that for the area marked thereon an estimated

value for the associated surface area is created.
