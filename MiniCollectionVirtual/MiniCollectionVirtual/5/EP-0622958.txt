<ABSTRACT>
Before transmission of motion image data, the period of 
a frame of the motion image data is counted using a clock 

signal used for the transmission to produce a frame count. 
The motion image data is then transmitted along with the 

frame count so that it can correctly be timed in frames at 
receiver.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data transmitter
apparatus and a data receiver apparatus between which desired
data of e.g. motion image is transferred at real time.As digital communication technologies being advanced,
a variety of transmitter apparatus have been developed for
transferring digital data of motion image through a transmission
channel. Fig. 5 shows one such prior art for transmitting
motion image data through a digital transmission
channel, in which a transmitter 501 in a data transmitter
apparatus 1 is coupled by a digital transmission channel 502
to a data receiver apparatus 2. The data receiver apparatus
2 comprises a clock reproducer 503 and a receiver 504.In operation, the motion image data in digital form is
transmitted as a stream of bits from the transmitter apparatus
1 via the transmission channel 502 to the clock reproducer
503 in the receiver apparatus 2. At the clock reproducer
503, a clock signal synchronized with the bit stream
is reproduced from the transmitted data. The transmitted or
input data is processed by the receiver 504 with synchronization
with the clock signal to reconstruct an original
image.  In such a manner, any motion image data can be transferred
through the digital transmission channel.However, the processing of the input image data at the
receiver apparatus 2 shown in Fig. 5 is controlled by the
clock signal which is synchronous with a clock signal for
data transmission through the transmission channel 502.
More particularly, a frame synchronizing signal for reproducing
the motion image is timed with the transmission clock
signal. Accordingly, a frame synchronizing signal at the
transmitter apparatus 1 has to be synchronous with the
transmission clock signal.When the transmission channel 502 is connected to a
plurality of asynchronous motion image data output apparatuses,
its clock signal can be synchronized with only one of
the apparatuses thus allowing the remaining apparatuses not
to be simultaneously operated.In document "Video, Sampling and Network Synchronization in a
TV codec" written by Manuela S. Pereira, et al. and published
at the 6th Mediterranean Electrotechnical Conference, 22-24 May
1991, is a video system described comprising a coder and a
decoder wherein the coder is transmitting encoded data to a
decoder apparatus via a digital transmission channel with a
video data rate of 140 Mbit/s. Since sampling and network
clocks are a synchronous a frequency accommodation scheme using
two video line memories is used. While one of these memories
