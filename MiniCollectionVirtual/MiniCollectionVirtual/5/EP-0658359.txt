<ABSTRACT>
The catalytic dehalogenation (or hydrodehalogenation) of halogen-containing compounds of elements of the 4th main group in the presence of hydrogen is made possible by using as catalyst a catalytically active system comprising silicon and at least one transition metal. Such catalytically active systems have a high activity and mechanical stability. For example, the process can be used for the synthesis of compounds or else for decomposing halogen-containing compounds, for example in the context of wastewater or waste gas purification processes. It is also suitable for the dehalogenation (hydrodehalogenation) of halogen-containing silane compounds, for example of silicon tetrachloride or alkyltrichlorosilane compounds. Thus, tetrachlorosilane can be converted into trichlorosilane. The original purity of the silanes used as starting material is maintained in the process. Also described is a finely divided, catalytically active system comprising silicon and at least one transition metal.
