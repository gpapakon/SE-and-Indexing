<ABSTRACT>
A backlight display includes a case having an optical window through which displayed information may be viewed. In addition it includes an electroluminescent panel for providing the backlight. It further includes a structured surface material between the electroluminescent panel and the optical window. The structured surface material has the property of reflecting light entering it while making an angle in a first predetermined group of angles with the axis of the display back to the electroluminescent panel. It further has the property of refracting light entering it while making an angle in a second predetermined group of angles to the axis of the display such that a majority of the light in the second group will exit it an output wedge that is smaller than the input wedge.

<DESCRIPTION>
A wide variety of illuminated electronic displays are currently in
common use. Perhaps the most familiar of such displays are cathode ray tubes
(CRT's). CRT's are popular because they have many advantages. They produce
bright, high resolution, color images. They do, however, have significant
disadvantages in certain situations. Compared with alternatives such as liquid
crystal displays (LCD's) and electroluminescent displays (ELD's) they are bulky
and consume large quantities of power. In contrast, LCD's are much thinner and
consume much less power. This makes LCD's preferable for applications where
space or energy consumption is important. Examples of applications where such
considerations are important are lap-top computers, where both energy
consumption and space are critical, and automobile dashboard displays, where the
volume is of particular importance.Because LCD's are not light emitting, they require a light source.
Although they may use ambient light, an internal light source typically placed
behind the display usually provides greater readability, especially in a dark
environment. As a result, there is a minimum thickness necessitated by the
illumination source.An alternative type of display is electroluminescent. In an
electroluminescent display, electroluminescent materials may be used as a light
source for another type of display, such as an LCD, or may be both the light
source and the display itself. Electroluminescent displays have the advantage of
being thin, cool, and highly efficient. One problem with electroluminescent
displays, however, is a lack of brightness. This is often overcome by increasing
the voltage applied to the electroluminescent material. While this will increase the
brightness of the display, it reduces the displays reliability and lifetime. A second problem with electroluminescent displays is
that they are inherently grainy in appearance. This
graininess reduces readability and increases operator
fatigue especially when such displays are used for
extended periods of time. The increase of voltage that
will produce brighter intensity still does little or
nothing to overcome the problem of the grainy appearance.From US-A-4 580 877 a combined display panel of LCD
display and an backlit EL display is known, in which the
glass substrate of the EL display is made rugged, so that
the radiation passing through the LCD display and the
electroluminescence from the EL layer are highly scattered.
Also from US-A-4 500 173, it is known to use an EL
layer for backlighting a LCD

Backlit display comprising:

a case (12) having an optical window and an axis
normal to said window,
an electroluminescent panel (16) in said case
(12),
a first structured surface material (18) between
said electroluminescent panel (16) and said

optical window, said first structured surface
material (18) being provided with a first smooth

surface (20) confronting said electroluminescent
panel (16) and a second structured surface (22)

opposite to the smooth surface, said structured
surface including multiple protrusions regularly

recurring and said structured surface material
(18) having the property that light entering it

while making an angle in a first predetermined
group of angles with said axis will be reflected

and light entering it while making an angle in a
second predetermined group of angles with said

axis will be refracted such that the majority of
the light in said second group of angles will form

an output wedge that is narrower than its
associated input wedge, said angles in said second

group of angles being greater than said angles in
said first group of angles.
Backlit display of claim 1 further comprising a light
gating means (26) between said first structured surface

material (18) and said optical window.
Backlit display of claim 2 wherein said light gating
means (26) is a liquid crystal display. 
Backlit display of claim 1 wherein said structured
surface (22) of said first first structured surface material (18)

has a plurality of triangular prisms thereon.
Backlit display of claim 4 wherein said triangular
prisms have included angles in the range of 70

degrees to 110 degrees.
Backlit display of claim 5 wherein said triangular
prisms have included angles substantially equal to 90

degrees.
Backlit display of claim 1 further comprising a
diffuser (62) between said electroluminescent panel

(16) and said first structured surface material (18).
Backlit display of claim 1 further comprising a
second structured surface material (18') between said

electroluminescent panel (16) and said optical
window, said second structured surface material (18')

being provided with a first smooth surface (20)
confronting said first structured surface material

(18) and a second structured surface (22) opposite to
the smooth surface (20), said structured surface (22)

including multiple protrusions regularly recurring
and said second structured surface material (18')

making an angle in a first predetermined group of

angles with said axis will be reflected and light
entering it while making an angle in a second pre-determined

group of angles with said axis will be
refracted such that the majority of the light in said

second group of angles will form an output wedge that
is narrower than its associated input wedge, said

angles in said second group of angles being greater
than said angles in said first group of angles. 
Backlit display of claim 8 wherein each of said
structured surfaces (22) of said structured surface

materials (18,18') has a plurality of triangular
prisms thereon.
Backlit display of claim 9 wherein said triangular
