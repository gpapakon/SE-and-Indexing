<ABSTRACT>
A fork lift truck loading mechanism (16; 116) 
mounted on a chassis (18; 118) of a movable truck (11; 

111) for loading a self-propelled fork lift truck (21; 
121) by connection to the forks (27, 28; 127, 128) of 

the fork lift truck (21; 121) so as to hold the fork 
lift truck (21; 121) and turning of the forks (27, 28; 

127, 128) together with the fork lift truck (21; 121) 
onto a bed (15; 115) of the truck (11; 111). The fork 

lift truck loading mechanism (16; 116) comprises a 
holding arrangement (35, 36; 135, 136) which is 

supported by the chassis (18; 118) of the truck (111) so 
as to be movable therewith and turned from substantially 

a horizontal position to a substantially perpendicular 
or forwardly inclined position so as to hold the forks 

(27, 28; 127, 128) of the fork lift truck (21; 121), and 
a rotary drive (44; 145, 146) interposed between the 

truck (11; 111) and the holding arrangement (35, 36; 
135, 136) for turning the holding arrangement (35, 36; 

135, 136).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fork lift truck 
loading mechanism mounted on a vehicle body for loading 
a fork lift truck which is self-propelled and used for 
loading and unloading operations. A fork lift truck is widely used for carrying or 
lifting a heavy object or a pallet in a warehouse, 
factory or office. This fork lift truck has wheels and 
is self-propelled, and can carry a heavy object without 
resorting to manpower, i.e. another operator, thereby 
contributing to ease of loading and unloading. Since 
this fork lift truck is required to lift the heavy 
object, it has a mast mechanism or counterweight 
thereon, which makes it heavy, thereby preventing it 
from traveling fast on a highway. Accordingly, the fork 
lift truck travels only within a limited area such as a 
factory or warehouse. As a result, the traveling speed 
of the fork lift truck when it carries the heavy object 
thereon is about 20 to 30 km/h which is relatively slow 
compared with other vehicles. When it is self-propelled 
for a long distance, it takes much time. If the loading 
or unloading operations are performed at other 
locations, another fork lift truck is required.  If the fork lift truck travels on a public road, it 
is necessary to obtain permission (such as a vehicle 
number plate) from a competent authority. However, when 
the fork lift truck is used only in the factory or 
warehouse, such permission is not necessary in many 
cases. Accordingly, when the fork lift truck is moved 
from one factory or warehouse to another factory or 
warehouse, it is customary to load the fork lift truck 
on a bed of a truck which is qualified to travel legally 
on a highway. Furthermore, when the fork lift truck is carried to 
a destination while loaded on the truck, if another fork 
lift truck is not provided at the destination, the 
carried fork lift truck must be unloaded from the truck 
with the help of other operators. However, due to 
shortage of manpower, the freight or cargo often cannot 
be unloaded from the truck. In such case, the fork lift 
truck is located on the truck bed together with other 
freight and the fork lift truck and other freight are 
unloaded from the truck bed at the destination, which is 
effective and reduces the burden imposed on the 
operator. As mentioned above, if the fork lift truck can be 
loaded on the truck bed, it is very convenient since it 
can be useful for loading or unloading other freight or 
cargo. However, since the fork lift truck per se is 
relatively large in bulk and has the

A fork lift truck loading mechanism (16; 116) 
comprising connecting means mounted on a movable truck (11; 

111) for connecting to forks (27, 28; 127, 128) of a fork 
lift truck (21; 121) to hold the fork lift truck, said 

connecting means being operable to turn the forks so as to 
turn the fork lift truck onto a bed (15; 115) of the truck.
