Compositions 
characterized in that
 they contain 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane
and ethanol in proportions for which they form a binary

azeotrope or pseudoazeotrope, said azeotrope or pseudoazeotrpe consisting of from
0.25 to 7.5 g of ethanol per 100 g of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane.
Compositions according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 they contain
from 0,5 to 7 g of ethanol per 100 g of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane.
Compositions according to claim 1 or 2, comprising at least 75% by
weight of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane.
Compositions according to anyone of claims 1 to 3 comprising
optionally an additive in a quantity of not more than 20% by weight of the

composition.
Composition according to claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that
 they contain
from about 93,5 to 99,5% by weight of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane and from about

6,5 to 0,5% by weight of ethanol.
Composition according to any one of claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that

it consists essentially of approximately 98.4% by weight of 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluorobutane
and approximately 1.6% by weight of ethanol, the boiling point

of which is approximately 39.2Â°C at a pressure of 995 mbar.
Use of the compositions according to any one of claims 1 to 6 as
cleaning agents.
Use of the compositions according to any one of claims 1 to 6 as
degreasing agents for solid surfaces.
Use of the compositions according to any one of claims 1 to 6 as
cleaning agents for printed circuit boards contaminated by a pickling flux and

residues from this flux.
Use of the compositions according to any one of claims 1 to 6 as
desiccating agents for removing the water adsorbed at the surface of solid objects.
