<ABSTRACT>
In an axial-flow or semi-axial-flow turbine having a rotationally symmetrical water feed ring (2), the curvature of the latter is maintained in the planes of section through the turbine axis (3) in such a way that as it continues to move closer to the impeller (1) it fits the direction of the turbine axis (3). The contour of the internal boundary surface (4) of the water feed ring (2) is formed from a plurality of concentric annular members (9, 10, 11) mounted one inside another. The annular members can be displaced towards the impeller, in order by blocking the contour to reduce the cross-section of the water feed ring (2) and to produce a better partial load efficiency. In the case of an extreme partial load, the impeller is then loaded only in an annular fashion in the outer region, whereas in the inner region an air cushion is produced in order to improve the separation at the interrupted contour.

An axial or semi-axial turbine having a blade wheel (1)
with a rotationally symmetrical water supply ring (2),

the curvature of which in cutting planes, which contain
the turbine axis (3), with increasing proximity to the

blade wheel (1) matches up with the direction of the
turbine axis (3), wherein the water supply ring (2)

comprises an inner limiting face (4) to the rotor disk
centre (5) and an outer limiting face (6) to the blade

wheel periphery (7) and wherein several concentric
annular members (9, 10, 11) form a part of the contour of

the inner limiting face (4) and are adjustable in the
direction aid the turbine axis (3),
characterised in that
 concentric annular members (9, 10,
11) are mounted directly in front of the blade wheel (1)

and with their contours can be delivered to the blades of
the blade wheel (1) right up to a minimum spacing (12,

13),

and in that at least one of the annular members (9, 10 ,
11) having the smallest diameter lies inside the blade

diameter (7) to produce better part-load efficiency by
moving the contour.
A turbine according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 each annular member (9, 10, 11) -
beginning with the innermost annular member (9) - can be

axially delivered to the blade wheel (1) in combination
with the annular members outwardly following it right to

the minimum distance (12, 13) typical for it.
A turbine according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 an axially moved annular member (9,
10, 11) in each case comprises an axial adjustment range

having axial limit stops (35) for the next innermost 
annular member, with it being possible to achieve the

minimum spacing (12, 13) typical for it to the blade
wheel only if annular members mounted inwardly in front

of it have already achieved their minimum spacing (with
respect) to the blade wheel.
A turbine according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 a packet of annular members (9, 10,
11) which can move axially towards one another can be

adjusted via a control element (33), which acts on the
outermost annular member (8).
A turbine according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that
 the outermost annular member is
constructed as an annular sliding valve (8) with which

the water supply can be prevented.
A turbine according to one of Claims 2 to 5,
characterised in that
 before achieving the minimum
spacing (12, 13) of an annular member (9, 10, 11), on its

inside a ventilation duct (14, 15, 16) is opened, through
which air can continue flowing in order to improve the

separation of the inlet flow in the event of part-load.
A turbine according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the annular members (9, 10, 11) are
mutually guided in the axial direction and under

gravitational force can be delivered to the blade wheel
(1) by slackening a hoistin
g device (17).
A turbine according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that
 the annular members (9, 10, 11) are
mutually guided within the limits of their axial movement

on helical lines. 
A turbine according to one of Claims 1 to 8,
characterised in that
 a rigid guide blade grid (19) with
guide blades (20) is mounted in front of the water supply

ring (2).
