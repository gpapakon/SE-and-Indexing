<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce this fluoride glass fibre amplifier, doped so as to amplify a light signal (S), an optical multiplexer (4) is fabricated which comprises, on the one hand, two silica fibres (6,8) and, on the other hand, a fluoride glass fibre (2), at least a segment of which is doped, and optical coupling is produced between the fluoride glass fibre and at least one other silica fibre (12,14).   Application to optical telecommunications.

Optical fibre incorporating a fluoride glass optical fibre 
doped in such a way as to be able to amplify a light signal (S) when 

a pumping radiation (P) is injected into the fibre, said amplifier 

being characterized in that it also comprises: 

a 2 to 1-type optical multiplexer (4) having on the one hand two 
silica optical fibres (6, 8) and on the other a single fluoride glass 

optical fibre (2, 30-28-32),
 
whereof at least one section is doped in such a way as to constitute 

said doped fluoride glass fibre, said multiplexer adapting the mode 
diameter of the silica fibres to the mode diameter of its fluoride 

glass fibre, 
at least one other silica optical fibre (12, 14) and 
an optical coupling means (10) between the latter and the 
fluoride glass fibre, said coupling means serving to adapt the mode 

diameter of said other silica fibre to the mode diameter of the fluoride 
glass fibre, the light signal (S) passing from a silica fibre located 

on one side of the amplifier to a silica fibre located on the other side 
thereof, whilst the pumping radiation (P) is injected by at least one 

silica fibre of the amplifier, which is not said latter silica fibres. 
Amplifier according to claim 1, characterized in that the optical 
coupling means is another 2 to 1-type optical multiplexer (10) having on 

the one hand two silica optical fibres (12, 14) and on the other the fluoride 
glass fibre (2, 30-28-32). 
Amplifier according to either of the claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that the core of said section is doped by ions of at least one 

rare earth. 
Amplifier according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the fluoride glass optical fibre (2) is doped over its 

entire length.  
 
Amplifier according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the fluoride glass optical fibre comprises a 

fluoride glass optical fibre section (28) doped in such a way as to 
be able to amplify the light signal and, on two sides of said section, 

two other undoped, fluoride glass optical fibre sections (30, 32). 
Process for the production of an optical amplifier incorporating 
a fluoride glass optical fibre doped so as to be able to amplify 

a light signal (S) when a pumping radiation (P) is injected into the fibre, 
said process being characterized in that it comprises the following stages: 


a 2 to 1 optical multiplexer (4) is produced having on the one hand 
two silica optical fibres (6, 8) and on the other a fluoride glass 

optical fibre (2, 30-28-32), whereof at least one section is doped so as 
to constitute said doped fluoride glass fibre, said multiplexer serving 

to adapt the mode diameter of the silica fibres to the mode diameter of 
its fluoride glass fibre and 
an optical coupling is brought about between the fluoride glass 
fibre (2, 30-28-32) and at least one other silica optical fibre (12, 14), 

said coupling being carried out in such a way as to adapt the mode diameter 
of said other silica fibre to the mode diameter of the fluoride 

glass fibre. 
Process according to claim 6, characterized in that a standard 
silica optical fibre is welded to each of said silica optical fibres 

and another standard silica optical fibre is welded to said other silica 
optical fibre, the mode diameter of the fluoride glass optical fibre 

being equal to the mode diameter of said silica optical fibres and said 
other silica optical fibre and smaller than the mode diameter of the 

standard silica fibres. 
Process according to either of the claims 6 and 7, characterized 
in that the ends of the fluoride glass fibre are polished perpendicularly 

or obliquely to its axis.
