<ABSTRACT>
The machine for manufacturing vulcanized-rubber tubes 
has a pair of heads (10,11) arranged oppositely with 

respect to mandrels (13,14) which rotate two or more 
tubular cores (15,16), supported by supporting elements 

(17,18) with fixed rollers on a supporting frame (19). The 
tubular cores are contained in a thermally insulated box-like 

container (20), wrapped in the tubes to be vulcanized 
and unloaded by transfer means. The container has heads for 

supplying electrical power to the cores. Devices are 
provided for removing the cores from the container. The 

machine also has a carriage (23) which can move along 
guides (22) which are parallel to the cores, and a 

mechanism (24-33) for wrapping the cores simultaneously 
with spirals of the materials to be used to manufacture 

tubes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved machine
for manufacturing vulcanized-rubber tubes.A machine disclosed in EP-A-0 410 367 in the name of
the same Assignee and defined in the precharacterizing
portion of the appended claim 1 is currently used to
manufacture vulcanized-rubber tubes.Said machine comprises a pair of heads arranged
oppositely with respect to mandrels which rotate two
tubular cores supported by supporting elements with fixed
rollers on a supporting frame.The tubular cores are flanked by a thermally insulated
openable box-like container suitable to contain said cores
when they are surrounded by the tubes to be vulcanized and
after the unloading thereof, which is performed with
transfer means.The heads of the container are provided with terminal
strips for supplying electrical power to the cores and for
heating them by means of the Joule effect.Means for removing the cores from the container are
provided.Wrapping of the cores with spirals of the materials to
be used to manufacture the tubes is performed with the aid
of a carriage which can slide along rails arranged on the
ground parallel to said cores.An operator is carried on board the carriage from one
end of the machine to the other and holds the various coils
of material to be wrapped in his hands.Naturally, the operator is capable of performing a
single wrapping operation at a time on a single core at a 
time.This constitutes a considerable operational limitation
for the machine as regards its production rate, which is
consequently limited.It should also be noted that in order to achieve
qualitatively good production of the tubes, the various
spirals obtained from the ribbons being wrapped must
mutually overlap in a preset and constant manner.The presence of an operator, onboard the carriage, who
distributes the materials, introduces in the evaluation of
qualitative results the variable constituted by the skill
of said operator in keeping the reels from which the
materials are unwound during carriage movement in the
correct position with respect to the machine.EP-A-0 231 154 discloses a strip-dispenser carriage
for use in the production of tubular elements by winding a
flat strip helically onto a rotating core. The strip-dispenser
includes a carriage frame movable in a direction
parallel to the extension of the rotating core, and a slide
which is slidably mounted on the carriage frame for
displacement with respect to the carriage frame parallel to
the direction of movement of the carriage frame. The slide
carries a flat coil of
