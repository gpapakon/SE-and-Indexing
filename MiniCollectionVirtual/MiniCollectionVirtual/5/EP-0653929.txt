<ABSTRACT>
A method of analysing astigmatism is disclosed which enables surgeons to ascertain what surgery may be required subsequent to initial surgery to achieve the preoperative aim of the initial surgery and to provide data amenable to statistical analysis which enables meaningful comparison of both multiple surgeries and techniques. The method includes determining a preoperative astigmatism (1), defining an aimed astigmatism (2) and determining an achieved astigmatism (3) following initial surgery. The astigmatism values are initially determined in a 0 to 180  range and are doubled to convert them to a 360  range. An aimed induced astigmatism vector (AIA), a surgically induced astigmatism vector (SIA) and a difference vector are calculated and angle values are halved to return the angle values to a 0  to 180  range. Magnitudes and angles of the vectors can be calculated to provide astigmatism magnitude values and angle values for modifying parameters of future surgery for improved performance of future surgery and for statistical analysis. The method also provides a rationale for determining a treatment parameter when spectacle and corneal astigmatism do not coincide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for performing corneal
surgery. A method of analysing astigmatism
is disclosed to provide information to enable surgeons
to correct astigmatism in patients and also to provide data
relating to surgical operations for correcting astigmatism
which surgeons can use to improve techniques and surgical
success.Current methods of analysing astigmatism are confined to
calculation of the vector of change surgically induced in
attaining the post-operative result from the pre-operative
state.This ably allows determination of total induced astigmatism
and the direction of the vector force acting in the eye.
It also enables calculation of the mean total surgical
astigmatism induced when a series of operations are
compared and analysed. However, the axes of surgically
induced astigmatism (SIA) generally varies considerably
within the 180° arc of range. This makes it extremely
difficult to make meaningful comparisons of astigmatic
change for a series, as one cannot obtain an average
directional change of vectors, as vectors in opposing or
partly opposing directions cancel each other out in varying
amounts.One practice carried out by some surgeons is to resort to
the sole option of tabulating each patient's results
individually, leaving it to the reader to estimate any
trend. Some surgeons attempt to provide an overview of
results, but lack the means to deduce a trend in induced 
astigmatism vectors as a group, because they have variable
orientation.Taking a mean of the angles has no validity in determining
the trend for axes, nor does it address the change in axes
from their pre-operative to post-operative astigmatic
status. It does not assess the success or desirability of
the achieved result; furthermore, it does not indicate the
extent to which the surgical aim was achieved. An attempt
has been made to address the complexities of correcting the
magnitude for the degrees of axis change by introducing the
approximation that this component varies as the cosine of
the difference between the attempted and the observed
(achieved) axes. This corrected value of magnitude was
substituted as the amount of surgically induced cylinder
90° to the axis of the incisions, the so-called "proper"
axis. It has been proposed to program so called Naylor's
equations into a computer program that requires slight
modifications to resolve the ambiguity and essentially
reproduce the Naylor table.The formula for calculation of SIA is derived from the
resultant of two plano-cylindrical lenses with axes
