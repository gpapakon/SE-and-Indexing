<ABSTRACT>
Procedure for production of a chemical-resistant halogenous plastic. Reactive groups are added to a halogenous polymer and the polymer is cross-linked by reaction with a multifunctional organic compound under the influence of heat during or after the processing of the material. PVC is a favoured polymer, but the method is also applicable to the production of cross-linked products from other halogenous polymers. The invention also concerns a chemical-resistant cross-linked plastic consisting of 20-98 % copolymer of vinyl chloride and a glycidylic monomer, 0-80 % of plasticizer, 0.05-10 % of a multifunctional organic cross-linker, 0.1-10 % of stabilizer and 0-3 % of lubricant. The use of this plastic in oil-resistant and chemical-resistant products, especially foils, is also covered by the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method for productional thermostable chemical resistant plastiThe invention concerns a procedure for the production thermostable chemical-resistant plastic. Extremely hi resistance to chemicals can. be achieved if a strong, homogeno cross-linked network is introduced into the polymer. This type polymer will be particularly suitable for applications where oi resistance is important, for example in oil booms. It is al suitable for foils, tarpaulins, membranes and as a hard-weari top layer for floor coverings. Cables, pipes and rainwear c also be mentioned as potential application areas.In the case of PVC in particular, cross-linking has long be considered a good method of improving the mechanical properti of this plastic at high temperatures. Many attempts ha therefore been made to find technical solutions to this proble The introduction of cross-linking with the aid of so-calle reactive plasticizers, such as difunctional and trifunctiona acrylates or methacrylates, has had some commercial success These reagents are added in quantities of 20-50 pph (pph = part per hundred parts of polymer) , and they are cross-linked b exposure to radiation or free radicals. The network that i formed is strong and heterogeneous, which leads to a considerabl more brittle finished product. At the same time this techniqu can easily reduce the ther ostability of the product because o the degrading effect of the radiation or the free radicals (se for example W. A. Salmon & L. D. Loan; J. Appl. Polym. Sci., .16 671, (1972)).A homopolymer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) has a certain conten 

 of reactive groups, inasmuch as the carbon-chlorine bond is pol and may be attacked by nucleophilic compounds. In particula thiolate ions have proved to be good nucleophiles (see f example. K. Mori & Y. Nakamura; J. Macromol. Sci. Chem. A12, (2 209, (1978)).In a number of articles and patents, Mori and Nakamura ha described cross-linking of PVC with various types of dithi triazines.There are several reasons why the above method has not been commercial success, despite its many attractive aspects, sin the cross-linking in this case is triggered by heat, t reactivity of the system must be so good that the cross-linki can be done without breaking down the polymer. At the same ti there are many processing techniques which require that th cross-linking is only done after the actual processing of th material is concluded. All this means that a very difficul balancing act is necessary to create a functional system. further complicating factor is
