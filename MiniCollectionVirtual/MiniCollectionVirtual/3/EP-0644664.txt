<ABSTRACT>
A system for processing a plurality of signals in 
parallel by a plurality of working-system processing 

units (1). A protection-system processing unit (2) is provided 
as a substitute for one of the working-system processing 

units, and switch units (3, 4) are provided for switching the 
routes of the signals so that the signals are processed 

by the protection-system processing unit instead of the 
substituted working-system processing unit. The 

characteristic of the protection-system processing unit (2) 
can be varied automatically under control of a 

characteristic control unit (8) so that the characteristic 
of the protection-system processing unit becomes the 

same as the characteristic of the substituted working-system 
processing unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
adjusting a characteristic of a protection unit when
switching from one of a plurality of working units
having different characteristics to the protection unit,
typically, an N-to-one protection switching system which
activates a protection unit instead of one of N working
units when said one of the N working units fails, where
N is an integer more than one.The system containing a plurality of working units
and a protection unit as above, is usually used in
terminal stations in transmission systems. In the
terminal stations, conventionally, a plurality of pieces
of terminal equipment are provided for receiving and
transmitting transmission signals transmitted through a
plurality of transmission lines, and at least one
protection unit is provided for substituting for one of
the plurality of working units which fails.Although the above plurality of working units and
the protection unit have substantially the same
construction, the respective working units are usually
preset in different ways. Therefore, when one of the
plurality of working units is substituted by the
protection unit, the protection unit must to be set in
the same manner as the substituted working unit.Conventionally, there is no technique for
automatically setting the protection unit when the
protection unit substitutes for one of the plurality of
working units. Therefore, the setting of the protection
unit must be performed manually, except in the case 
wherein all of the plurality of working units and the
protection unit are set in the same manner.Document Patent Abstracts of Japan vol. 010 no. 039 (E-381),
15 February 1986 & JP-A-60 194839 (Fujitsu KK) 3 October 1985
discloses a line switching system having multiple channel
lines M1 - Mn with a spare channel line P. In each channel is
a transmitter 2-1 to 2-n, 2-P which transmits to a respective
receiver 3-1 to 3-n, 3-P. Furthermore, a first switching unit
comprising respective channel switches 1-1 to 1-n, 1-P is
connected at the input side to the corresponding channel
transmitter and a second switching unit comprising respective
channel switches 5-1 to 5-n, 5-P is connected to the output
side of each channel receiver. A fault in any channel is
detected by a respective controller 4-1 to 4-n, to cause
controller 9 to selectively operate the second switches 5-1
to 5-n, 5-P to select a correction line corresponding to the
faulty active line Mi. An equal characteristic is obtained
for each active line and the line is stably switched.Document
