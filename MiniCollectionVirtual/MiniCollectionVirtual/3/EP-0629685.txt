<ABSTRACT>
The process produces a stream of hot clean gas 
substantially free from particulate matter, ammonia, 

alkali metal compounds, halides and sulfur-containing gas 
for use as synthesis gas, reducing gas, or fuel gas. A 

solid carbonaceous fuel with or without liquid or gaseous 
hydrocarbonaceous fuel and containing halides, alkali 

metal compounds, sulfur, nitrogen and inorganic ash, is 
reacted by partial oxidation to produce a hot raw gas 

stream comprising H₂, CO, CO₂, H₂O, CH₄, NH₃, HCl, HF, H₂S, 
COS, N₂, Ar, particulate matter, vapor phase alkali metal 

compounds, and molten slag. The hot raw gas stream is 
split into two streams which are separately deslagged, 

cleaned and recombined. Ammonia in the gas mixture is 
catalytically disproportionated into N₂ and H₂. The 

ammonia-free gas stream is then cooled and halides in the 
gas stream are reacted with a supplementary alkali metal 

compound to remove HCl and HF. Alkali metal halides, 
vaporized alkali metal compounds and residual fine 

particulate matter are removed from the gas stream by 
further cooling and filtering. The sulfur-containing 

gases in the process gas stream are then reacted at high 
temperature with a mixed metal oxide sulfur sorbent 

material to produce a sulfided sorbent material which is 
then separated from the hot clean purified gas stream 

having a temperature of at least 540°C.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a partial oxidation process for
producing hot clean synthesis, reducing, or fuel gas substantially
free from entrained particulate solids and gaseous impurities
including ammonia, halides, vapor phase alkali metal compounds, and
sulfur.The partial oxidation process is a well known process for
converting liquid hydrocarbonaceous and solid carbonaceous fuels
into synthesis gas, reducing gas, and fuel gas. See coassigned
U. S. Pat. Nos. 3,988,609; 4,251,228, 4,436,530, and 4,468,376 for
example, which are incorporated herein by reference. The removal
of fine particulates and acid-gas impurities from synthesis gas is
described in coassigned U. S. Pat. Nos. 4,052,175, 4,081,253, and
4,880,439; and in 4,853,003; 4,857,285; and 5,118,480 which are all
incorporated herein by reference. However, the aforesaid
references, as a whole, do not teach nor suggest the subject
process for the production of hot clean synthesis gas, reducing
gas, and fuel gas which are substantially free from particulate
matter, ammonia, halides, alkali metal compounds, and sulfur-containing
gases. By the subject process, synthesis gas, reducing
gas, and fuel gas having a temperature in the range of about 540°C to 700°C (1000°F
to 1300°F) are produced. Gas produced by the subject process for
burning, e.g., fuel gas in the combuster of a gas turbine, will not
contaminate the atmosphere. Gas produced for use as a synthesis
gas will not deactivate the synthesis catalyst. The subject process relates to a partial oxidation
process for the production of a stream of hot clean gas
substantially free from particulate matter, ammonia, halides,
alkali metal compounds, and sulfur-containing gases for use as
synthesis gas, reducing gas, or fuel gas comprising:
(1) reacting a hydrocarbonaceous fuel comprising a solid
carbonaceous fuel with or without liquid hydrocarbonaceous fuel or
gaseous hydrocarbon fuel, wherein said fuel contains halide, alkali
metal compounds, sulfur, nitrogen and inorganic ash containing
components, and said fuel is reacted with a free-oxygen containing
gas in a free-flow vertical refractory lined partial oxidation gas
generator to produce a hot raw gas stream having a temperature in
the range of about 980°C to 1650°C (1800°F to 3000°F)and comprising H2, CO, CO2, H2O,
CH4, NH3, HCl, HF, H2S, COS, N2, Ar and containing particulate
matter, vapor phase alkali metal compounds, and molten slag;(2) splitting the stream of hot raw gas from (1) into two separate
gas streams A and B; preferably wherein the
