<ABSTRACT>
A rubber composition which is the vulcanization reaction product of a rubber, sulfur or a sulfur donor, particular anti-reversion coagents, and specific additive components, is disclosed. The invention also relates to a sulfur-vulcanization process which is carried out in the presence of an anti-reversion coagent and an additive component and the use of an anti-reversion coagent in combination with an additive component in a process for the sulfur-vulcanization of rubber. The resulting sulfur-vulcanized rubbers have significantly improved physical properties.

<DESCRIPTION>
Sulfur-vulcanized Rubber CompositionThis invention relates to a sulfur-vulcanized rubber composition having improved physical properties. More particularly, it relates to a sulfur-vulcanized rubber composition which is vulcanized in the presence of an anti-reversion coagent and an additive component comprising a thiol and an electron donor group. The invention also relates to a sulfur-vulcanization process which is carried out in the presence of an anti-reversion coagent and an additive component comprising a thiol and an electron donor group and the use of an anti- reversion coagent in combination with an additive component comprising a thiol and an electron donor group in the sulfur-vulcanization of rubber. Finally, the invention also relates to rubber products comprising rubber vulcanized with sulfur in the presence of an anti- reversion coagent and an additive component comprising a thiol and an electron donor group.In the tire and belt industries, among others, better mechanical and heat resistance properties are being demanded. In order to improve these properties, it has been proposed to use other agents than sulfur in vulcanization systems or to add such an agent to sulfur- vulcanization systems. One known type of agent are the malei ides. Maieimide-vulcanization systems are disclosed in, "Vulcanization With Maleimides," Journal of Applied Polymer Science, Vol. 8, pp. 2281-2298 (1964).Some articles relating to the sulfur-vulcanization of rubbers disclose the use of bismaleimides as coagents. Such articles include Chavchich, T.A., et al., Kauchuk i Rezina, vol. 4, pp. 20-3, 1981; Krasheninnikov, N.A., et al., Kauchuk i Rezina, vol. 3, pp. 10-12, 1974; Krasheninnikov, N.A., et al., Kauchuk i Rezina, vol. 3, pp. 16-19, 1975; Prashchikina, A.S., et al., Kauchuk i Rezina, No. 10, pp. 15-19, 1985. Even more recently, Japanese patent applications J6 

3286-445 and J63312-333 disclosed the vulcanization of rubber with sulfur and an aliphatic bis-maleimide or N,N'-toluene bis-maleim de.Several patent publications exist which disclose sulfur-vulcanization systems wherein maleimides are used as coagents in combination with other components. Such patent publications include Japanese patent publication J6 1014-238, European patent applications 0 191931, 0345825 and 0410 152.However, despite the fact that some of the above publications claim to improve rubber properties with the reduction in reversion by addition of a bismaleimide, in actual practice the reduction in reversion achieved with the bismaleimides
