<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to infusion devices.
More particularly, the invention according to claim 1 concerns an elastomeric
bladder type infusion device which is used for delivering a
beneficial agent to a patient at a substantially constant rate.
The device uniquely includes means for intermixing a first
compound, such as a drug, with a second component such as a
parenteral liquid prior to delivering the solution thus formed
to the patient.Many types of infusion pumps embodying an elastomeric
balloon or bladder for delivery of a quantity of pharmaceutically
active material to a patient have been suggested in the
past. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,915,693 issued to Hessel
discloses an infusion pump comprising an elastomeric bladder
having at least an open end, and an elongate stress member
extending concentrically within the entire length of the hollow
portion of the bladder and having a fluid tight seal therewith.
Both a filling port and an exit port are provided in the stress
member, each in fluid communication with the interior of the
bladder by way of an influent and an effluent lumen, respectively.
The stress member has a diameter that is greater than
the relaxed internal diameter of the bladder, and has a length
that exceeds the relaxed internal length of the hollow portion
of the bladder, so that it prestesses the bladder in both the
axial and radial directions when disposed therein, substantially
filling the bladder in its unfilled state. The Hassel
device also includes a one-way valve on the stress member 
which permits flow in the influent lumen only in the direction
of the interior of the bladder.Another type of balloon type infusion device is disclosed
in U.S. Patent No. 4, 386,929 issued to Perry, et al. The
Perry, et al. device has spaced apart inlet and outlet means
and the bladder which is capable of expanding and contracting
radially and axially upon inflation and deflation. When deflated
the lumen of the bladder is substantially completely
filled by lumen filling means which protect the bladder from
being punctured by the hypodermic needle used to fill and
inflate the bladder. The lumen filling means resists the
compressive load applied during insertion of the needle and
maintains the inlet and outlet means in spaced apart relationship
while providing substantially no resistance to the axial
expansion of the bladder. By having the lumen of the bladder
filled with the lumen filling means when the bladder is deflated,
before its subsequent inflation and deflation,
