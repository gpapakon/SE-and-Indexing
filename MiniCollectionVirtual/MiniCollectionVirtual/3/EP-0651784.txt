<CLAIMS>
Yeast strains 
characterized in that
 they comprise at least one copy of a gene
coding for a lactic acid bacterium lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), under the control of

sequences regulating the expression of said gene in yeast.
Strains according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said yeast is of the genus

Saccharomyces.
Strains according to any one of claims I or 2, 
characterized in that
 the expressed
gene is the gene of 
Lactobacillus casei
 LDH.
Expression cassette 
characterized in that
 it comprises the gene of a lactic acid
bacterium LDH associated with regulatory sequences which are active in yeast.
Expression vectors, 
characterized in that
 they comprise an expression cassette
according to claim 4, for use in producing the transformed yeast strains according to

claim 1.
Vectors according to claim 5, 
characterized in that
 they are shuttle vectors, further
comprising a bacterial origin of replication and a marker which is selectable in a

bacterium.
