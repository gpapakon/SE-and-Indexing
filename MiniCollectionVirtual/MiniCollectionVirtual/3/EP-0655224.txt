<ABSTRACT>
A spring loaded screw and an associated driver for use 
in orthopedic applications, particularly for temporarily 

securing cutting guides and the like to the tibia and femur 
for preparation of the bone surfaces in a total knee 

replacement. A slidable sleeve on said screw is spring 
biased away from the driver. As the screw sleeve seats, the 

sleeve slides upwardly against the compression spring to 
disengage the driver from the proximal end of the screw. The 

driver contains a slidably disposed central cylinder which 
can be axially moved by sliding an externally mounted 

sleeve. To retract the screw, the driver sleeve is advanced 
toward the screw to urge the cylinder toward the proximal end 

of the screw sufficiently far to enable grasping of the 
proximal end of the screw for retraction thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the fixation of
orthopedic prosthetics, and more particularly to a screw and
complimentary driver/extractor for temporary attachment of
cutting guides and other apparatus to a bone for preparation
of a bone surface for attachment of a prosthesis.Prosthetic joint components have long been known and
used in the art. Examples include knee, hip and elbow
replacements. Prosthetic components are available from
manufacturers such as Zimmer, Inc. of Warsaw, Indiana. To
prepare the bone surfaces for attachment of the prosthetic
components, it is often necessary to make a series of cuts in
the bone or to remove portions of the bone to cause the bone
to conform to the size and shape of the components which are
to be attached thereto. Every surgeon strives for precise
cuts, since the more precise the cut, the more likely is the
prosthetic component to be anatomically correct. An
anatomically correct component provides a superior result and
will last longer than one that is not anatomically correct.One situation in which such bone cutting is required is
in the preparation of the femur and tibia for a total knee
replacement. Exemplary knee replacements are available from
Zimmer, Inc. under the trademark MGII. In particular,
implantation of press-fit non-cemented total knee components
requires very precise bone cuts. In some prosthetics, an 
exact fit is required for the successful bone-ingrowth
fixation of joint replacement components.Typically, bone cuts are made by an oscillating saw or a
reciprocating saw utilizing cutting guides or jigs stabilized
by pinning and clamping. Various guides and methods for
temporarily but rigidly securing these guides to the bone
surfaces have been developed. Examples are found in U.S.
Patent Nos. 4,787,383; 4,825,857; and 5,129,909. In
particular, in U.S. Patent No. 5,129,909, screws are utilized
for securing the guides to the bone so that the guide is held
in compression against the bone. Proper and rigid affixation
of the guides to the bone are required to assure reproducibly
accurate bone cuts, prosthetic seating and lower limb
alignment. However, some existing guides have been found to
be undesirable because there was inadequate rigid fixation of
the cutting block to the bone. As a result, in some cases,
it was difficult, if not impossible, to predictably achieve a
precise fit of the femoral component on the distal femur.When cutting the bone, it is important that the guides
be secured immovably to the bone and that the guides be
secured with

A screw (10) adapted to be driven by a driver (20) for removably securing an
orthopaedic device to a bone surface, characterised in that said screw comprises:


a central shaft (11) having a proximal end (13) and a distal end (22) and a central axis
extending from said proximal end (13) to said distal end (22).
a continuous thread (12) disposed on said central shaft (11) and extending to said distal
end (22) of said shaft (11);
a coupling (14) disposed on said proximal end (13) of said shaft (11) adapted to be
engaged by the driver (20) in torque transmitting relation therewith for rotation of said screw

(10);
a sleeve (15) disposed about said shaft (11) of said screw (10), said sleeve (15) being
generally coaxial with said shaft (11) and being movable in an axial direction with respect to said

shaft (11), said sleeve (15) having a lower surface (18) facing said distal end (22) of said shaft
(11); and
a spring (16) for biasing said sleeve (15) away from said proximal end (13) of said shaft
(11);

wherein advance of said screw (10) in a distal direction into the bone surface after seating
of said lower surface (18) of said sleeve (15) causes said sleeve (15) to ride toward said proximal

end (13) of said shaft (11) against the bias of said spring (16) to terminate a torque transmitting
relationship between the driver (20) and said coupling (14) on said proximal end (13) of said

shaft (11).
The screw (10) as recited in claim 1 characterised in that it further comprises a lip
(19) disposed on said sleeve (15) and a ridge (17) disposed on said shaft (11), said lip (19) and

said ridge (17) cooperating to limit axial movement of said sleeve (15) toward said distal end
(22) of said shaft (11). 
The screw (10) as recited in claim 1 characterised in that said spring (16) is
compressed as said screw (10) advances into the bone after seating of said lower surface (18) of

said sleeve (15).
The screw (10) as recited in claim 3 characterised in that said spring (16) provides
a predetermined load when it is sufficiently compressed that there is no longer a torque

transmitting relationship between the driver (20) and said coupling (14).
Apparatus for removably securing an orthopaedic device to a bone surface,
characterised in that said apparatus comprises:


a screw (10) having a proximal end (13), a distal end (22), an axis extending from
proximal end to said distal end, and a continuous screw thread (12) extending about said screw

(10) to said distal end (22);
a driver (20) having a proximal end (64) and a distal end (62), said distal end (62) of said
driver (20) having a recess (80) configured to receive said proximal end (13) of said screw (10)

by a spring (16), said sleeve (15) having lower surfaces (18) facing said distal end (22) of said

screw (10), said sleeve (15) moving axially along said screw (10) toward said proximal end (13)
against the bias of said spring (16) when said lower surfaces (18) of said sleeve (15) are seated

to remove said distal end (62) of said driver (20) from said proximal end (13) of said screw (10)
so that said proximal end (13) of said screw (10) is not received in said recess (80) to prevent the

further transmission of torque from said driver (20) to said proximal end (13) of said screw (10).

The apparatus as recited in Claim 8 characterised in that said shaft (70) includes
an extension (93) of said slot (92) extending at an angle with respect to the direction of

elongation of said slot (92), whereby as rotational torque is applied to said proximal end (64) of
said driver (20) to drive said screw (10) into the bone, said pin (88) is urged into said extension

(93) and against end surfaces thereof to prevent unwanted axial movement of said cylinder (72)
