<ABSTRACT>
A warehouse (1) and a commissioning device (2) are arranged so close to one another that a single handling device (3) can be used for supplying articles to the warehouse (3) and the commissioning device (2), and also for removing articles from the warehouse (1). Client orders can thus be worked out in a fully automatic manner, avoiding long paths of transport, which is particularly important in the mail-order business.
