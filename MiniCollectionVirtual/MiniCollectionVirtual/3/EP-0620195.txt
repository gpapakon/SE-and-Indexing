<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatically operated mechanism for a glassware forming 
machine is located in an aperture in a top plate of the 

machine and comprises entry ports in a downwardly facing 
surface which mate with exit ports for air supplies located 

in an upwardly facing surface of the top plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with machines for the
manufacture of glassware.One of the most widely used types of machines for the
manufacture of glassware is the so-called I.S. machine,
which machine comprises a plurality of identical sections
arranged side by side, the sections operating continuously
out of time with each other to produce glassware. The I.S.
machine has developed over the last sixty years from the
original machine of this type described in US Patent 1911119
- Ingle.While during this period of sixty years there have been
many improvements in I.S. machines, e.g. increased number of
sections, increased numbers of moulds in each section,
electronic control mechanisms replacing mechanical
controls, the basic mechanical structure of the I.S. machine
has remained unaltered.Among the features which are common to almost all
existing I.S. machines are the following;
1. The various mechanisms of the machine are integrated
into a machine frame, and access to repair such mechanism is
difficult.2. The various mechanisms are generally pneumatically
operated, and a complex array of piping is necessary to
provide the required supplies of compressed air. This
piping is very time consuming [and thus expensive] not only
to assemble in manufacture but also to repair.3. If any substantial repair is necessary to a section,
the whole I.S. machine [i.e. all the sections] has to be
shut down while the repair is carried out.4. The various sections are mounted side by side in a
machine frame, having upright frame members which support
ancillary mechanisms, for example gob distributors. Air
supplies to the various sections are provided from piping 
leading from these upright frame members. Consequently
there is a risk of different pneumatic conditions obtaining
in sections remote from the upright frame members and those
close to them, a risk which increases with the number of
sections in the machine which is now frequently 12 or more.EP-A-184394 describes a fluid operated individual section
glassware forming machine. The intention is that the
machine should be capable of adaptation for either pneumatic
or hydraulic operation, and to avoid the proliferation of
pipes which would result, the machine is so constructed that
fluid under pressure to operate the various mechanism of the
machine is provided through passageways formed in the plates
providing the framework of the section. While the
possibility of utilizing these passages for pneumatic
operation is mentioned, it is not described; the description
is of use of

<CLAIMS>
A glassware forming machine comprising

a box like frame comprising parallel side walls and a
top plate (178) which is provided with
an aperture (268) having a periphery with locating
faces
a pneumatically operated mechanism (360) located in the
aperture (268) comprising a downwardly facing surface which

engages an upper surface (236) of the top plate (178) and
with vertical locating surfaces (385) which engage the

locating faces of the top plate
the top plate (178) being provided in its upper surface
with a series of exit ports (e.g. 392) which are connected

to a source of operating air
the mechanism being provided in its downwardly facing
surface with a series of entry ports (e.g. 396,412),
the arrangement being such that when the mechanism is
located in the aperture (268) the upper surface of the top

plate (178) engages the downwardly facing surface of the
mechanism, thus to determine the vertical position of the

mechanism, the locating faces of the top plate engage the
vertical locating surfaces (385) of the mechanism, thus to

determine the horizontal position of the mechanism, and the
exit ports (e.g. 392) in the top plate mate with the entry ports

(e.g. 396,412) in the mechanism thus to enable the supply of
operating air to the mechanism.
A glassware forming machine according to claim 1

wherein the downwardly facing surface of the mechanism and
the upper surface (236) of the top plate (178) engage in a horizontal

plane. 
A glassware forming machine according to claim 1
wherein the locating surfaces (385) of the mechanism (360) and the

locating faces of the top plate (178) are circular.
A glassware forming machine according to claim 1
wherein the locating faces of the top plate (178) are provided

around the aperture (268).
A glassware forming machine according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein the mechanism (360) is secured to the top

plate (178) by a series of bolts (386) passing through a flange portion (364)
of the mechanism.
A glassware forming machine according to any one of the
preceding claims wherein an upper portion of the mechanism (360)

extends above and a lower portion extends below the top
plate (178), the contour of the mechanism below the top plate

being such that the mechanism can be located on the top
plate by passing the lower portion through the aperture (268).
