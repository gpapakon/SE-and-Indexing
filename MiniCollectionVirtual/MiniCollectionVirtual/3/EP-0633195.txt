<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a closure for a container comprising 
essentially a main valve body (3) adaptable on a container 

neck (5) and comprising a valve means (33,33') sealingly 
engageable, by gravity optionally assisted by a spring 

means (36), in a corresponding valve seat (37,37'), a 
retention means (41,36,41') for the valve means and tamper 

evidence means (11,13) between the main valve body (3) and 
the container neck (5) characterized in that it is 

associated with a flow control element (51) which comprises 
an essentially cylindrical extension (53) of the main valve 

body (3), which extends into the container and which 
comprises, at the end opposite to the valve body, a product 

flow orifice (55), at least one air flow orifice (57), and 
optionally, at the valve body end, one or at least two 

spaced drain holes (59).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved reusable 
closure, intended for returnable and reusable containers 
for liquid, such as containers for herbicides, insecticides 
or other regulated products. In general, the chemical industry is looking for more 
environmentally friendly packs and for a reduction in the 
consumption of synthetic materials such as plastic 
materials in the packaging of different products including 
herbicides, insecticides .....etc. Moreover, relevant authorities more and more discourage the 
users of such packs from burning the residual empty packs 
and/or more and more encourage or even oblige the supplier 
of such packs to accept empty packs returned to them by the 
users. As a consequence the industry has started to turn 
its attention to reusing empty packs rather than destroying 
them or recycling the pack material. One problem posed by the repeated use of such packs or 
containers, relates to the closure system used on the pack 
or container. Single trip closure systems (used only once) 
are generally not suitable. Furthermore, the closure 
system needs to remain integral once the pack or container 
has been opened if it needs to be reused later. In 
addition, the closure system should be suitable for 
repeated uses during the lifetime of the returnable 
container.  
 Another problem relates to the possible contamination of 
the returned pack or container by products for which the 
said pack or container was originally not intended. The 
industry may of course, foresee a cleaning and/or rinsing 
of the pack or container, before refilling with the same 
liquid product it was originally intended for, in order to 
comply with regulations in that respect. Such cleaning 
and/or rinsing processes are, however, expensive and 
require the industry to invest in cleaning and rinsing 
equipment which increases the total cost of packaging, and 
hence of the product sold to the customer. There is thus a need for improved closure systems that are 
suitable for repeated uses of the said closure system 
during the lifetime of a returnable and reusable container, 
and that prevent contamination of the container during 
repeated uses thereof, with products said container was 
originally not intended for. Moreover, such an improved closure system should allow for 
rapid emptying of the product from the returnable 
container, preferably without splashing of liquid during 
the pouring operation, and possibly with controlled air 
entry to prevent or reduce glugging. The aim of the present

<CLAIMS>
A closure for a container comprising essentially a 

main valve body (3) adaptable on a container neck (5) 
and comprising a valve means (33,33') sealingly 

engageable, by gravity optionally assisted by a spring 
means (36), in a corresponding valve seat (37,37'), a 

retention means (41, 36,41') for the valve means and 
tamper evidence means (11, 13) between the main valve 

body (3) and the container neck (5) characterized in 
that it is associated with a flow control element (51) 

which comprises an essentially cylindrical extension 
(54) of the main valve body (3), which extends into 

the container and which comprises, at the end opposite 
to the valve body, a product flow orifice (55), at 

least one air flow orifice (57), and optionally, at 
the valve body end, one or at least two spaced drain 

holes (59). 
The closure of claim 1 characterized in that it 
further comprises a cap (9) which is adaptable on the 

main valve body (3), by a thread means, ratchet means 
or other suitable means known per se. 
The closure of claim 2 characterized in that it 
comprises tamper evidence means (11, 25) between the 

cap (9) and the main valve body. 
The closure of either of claims 2 and 3 characterized 
in that the cap (9) comprises an abutment means (45) 

intended to maintain the valve means (33,33') in firm 
sealing engagement with the valve seat (37,37'), in 

any position of the container.  
 
The closure of any of claims 2 to 4 characterized in 
that the cap (3) comprises a sealing means (47) which 

acts in association with corresponding parts (49) of 
the main valve body (3). 
The closure of any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the valve means consists of a 

ball valve (33) and the valve seat (37) consists of a 
circular opening, the rim of which is provided with 

sealing means (39). 
The closure of claim 6 characterized in that the ball 
valve (33) may be guided along a track consisting of 

at least three preferably regularly spaced ribs (35) 
integral with the wall of the main valve body (3). 
The closure of claim 7 characterized in that the track 
is contoured and ramped with regard to the center line 

of the closure, in the sense of guiding the ball (33) 
away from the product flow passage. 
The closure of any of claims 6 to 8 characterized in

orifice (67) which is smaller than the seal size (39) 
of the main valve body, the base of the said
