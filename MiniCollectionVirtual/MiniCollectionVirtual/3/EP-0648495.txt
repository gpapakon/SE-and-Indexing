<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a novel, water-insoluble, cation-complexed anionic 
polysaccharide that is readily dispersible into aqueous media to provide an ingestible 

composition having a low viscosity. An important aspect of the present invention is that 
it provides such compositions that are heat sterilizable. Furthermore, the water-insoluble, 

cation-complexed anionic polysaccharide of the present invention cause no 
or minor increases to the viscosity of such liquids that contain at least one member 

selected from the group consisting of proteins, peptides and amino acids. Another 
aspect of the invention concerns a method for administering an antidiarrheal 

composition to a human, said antidiarrheal composition comprising at least one water-insoluble, 
cation-complexed anionic polysaccharide dispersed in an aqueous medium. 

These compositions are useful as a nutritional means of improving gastrointestinal 
function including bowel function and increasing absorption of organic nutrients, 

inorganic nutrients and water by the gastrointestinal tract. 
In another aspect of the present invention is provided a novel method of 
preparing a water-insoluble, cation-complexed anionic polysaccharide comprising 

wetting a starting anionic polysaccharide with water to a total solids content of about 30 
to 70%, adding a cation and then milling. 
In yet another aspect of the present invention is provided a composition 
comprising a water-insoluble, cation-complexed anionic polysaccharide. 
This invention also provides a low viscosity, feeding composition providing an 
individual's requirements for carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals and at 

least one substantially water-insoluble, cation-complexed anionic polysaccharide in an 
aqueous medium. This same composition may be prepared in a dehydrated state and 

then subsequently rehydrated when ready for use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to improved ingestible liquids. More specifically,
this invention relates to such liquids that provide a low viscosity composition
which among other things is useful in normalizing bowel function in individuals
consuming such compositions. In addition, this invention relates to novel cation-complexed
polysaccharides, methods for making the same and their use in the
above described ingestible liquids.Nutritional therapy (including use as nutritionals or pharmaceuticals) is a
means for improving and/or maintaining the nutritional and health status of both
normal and medically compromised mammals, including humans. It is well known
that the administration of liquid nutritional therapy to mammals is often
accompanied by various gastrointestinal disturbances referred to as intolerance.
The most prevalent of these is irregular bowel function such as constipation and
diarrhea. Diarrhea can lead to fluid or electrolyte imbalance and malnutrition.
Abnormal bowel function would include unbalanced nutrient and water absorption
which could result in constipated or diarrheal responses. Various means have been
recommended for normalizing gastrointestinal function and reducing diarrhea
disturbances associated with liquid nutritional therapy. These include
pharmacological, surgical and nutritional means. However, diarrheal disturbances
are still a common side effect accompanying liquid nutritional therapy despite the
use of any of these means to reduce diarrheal disturbances.A nutritional means for normalizing gastrointestinal function includes the
enrichment of liquid nutritionals with plant derived dietary fiber. Numerous types
of dietary fibers are currently available. Basically, dietary fiber passes through the
small intestine undigested by enzymes and is a kind of natural and necessary
laxative. Dietary fiber is a term that is well understood by those skilled in the art
and includes nonstarch polysaccharides and lignin that are not digested by the
enzymatic secretions of the gastrointestinal tract. Examples of these fibers are 
celluloses, hemicelluloses, pectin, gums, mucilages, lignin and lignin material
varying in different plants according to type and age. Plant derived dietary fiber
compositions which have been suggested for enrichment of liquid nutritionals
include four classes of fiber differentiable by their solubility in water and
fermentability by colonic microflora. These classes of fiber described in the prior
art include soluble-fermentable, soluble-nonfermentable,
