<ABSTRACT>
A dosing and dispensing device for washing powder or the 
like, in automatic washing machines, comprising a container 

(1) for washing powders or other kinds of powder compounds 
for washing, which is intended to be placed directly 

together with the linen in the drum of the automatic washing 
machine and is reusable for an indefinite number of 

subsequent washings. The container (1) is realized of a 
material permeable to water and to said powder compounds in 

their dissolved form, as well as insoluble in water and 
being provided of openable closure means (2, 3, 4) that keep 

the container (1) in closed condition during the whole 
washing step, so that the washing powder or other kinds of 

compounds are progressively discharged, in their completely 
dissolved condition in water, only through the walls of the 

container (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a dispenser for washing 
powders, or the like, in automatic washing machines. Presently, in automatic washing machines the washing 
powders and others additives are supplied to compartments, 
from which they are entrained and supplied to the drum of 
the machine by the washing water that flows through the 
compartments before being suppliede to the drum. However, 
this way of proceeding presents the drawback that the 
washing water is not able to entrain the whole amount of 
powder compond, thus leaving in the said compartments, 
residual amounts of solids consisting in powder compound 
agglomerations adhering to them. Besides the dirtying of the 
compartments, that must be cleaned before every subsequent 
washing, the required compound concentration in the drum to 
obtain the optimum actives principles exploitation is not 
achieved. The dissolution of the compound results even 
incomplete and often a certain amount of not dissolved 
powder settle on the drum bottom. In order to obtain the 
sufficient concentration of compound in the washing 
solution, users are compelled to considerably increase the 
detergent doses or powder additives, with a greater use of 
them. To avoid such drawbacks, some users put the washing 
powder or additives directly in the drum together with the 
linen. Even in this case the exploitation of compounds is 
not the best and it is possible to damage fabrics, 
particularly colored ones, because powder is directly in  
 
contact with fabrics before dissolving in water. The 
solution concentration is not uniform during washing, but it 
is particularly high in contact zones of single compound 
grains adhering to fabrics. An object of the invention is to realize a dispenser for 
washing powders or the like that enables the elimination of 
the above disadvantages and an optimum exploitation of the 
washing powder and additives, by creating best distribution 
and dissolution conditions. The present invention achieves said object by providing 
a dispenser for washing powders or the like, in automatic 
washing machines, consisting of a container for the washing 
powders or other kinds of powder compounds for washing, that 
is intended to be placed directly in the drum of the washing 
machine together with the linen and that is reusable for an 
indefinite number of subsequent washings, the container 
being realized in a material permeable to water and to the 
powder compounds in their dissolved form, as well as 
insoluble in water and being provided with

A dosing and dispensing device for washing powder or 
the like, in automatic washing machines, characterized in 

that it is formed by a container (1) for washing powders or 
other kinds of powder compounds for washing, which is 

intended to be placed directly together with the linen in 
the drum of the automatic washing machine and is reusable 

for an indefinite number of subsequent washings, the 
container (1) being realized of a material permeable to 

water and to said powder compounds in their dissolved form, 
as well as insoluble in water and being provided of openable 

closure means (2, 3, 4) that keep the container (1) in 
closed condition during the whole washing step, so that the 

washing powder or other kinds of compounds are progressively 
discharged, in their completely dissolved condition in 

water, only through the walls of the container (1). 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that 
is realized as a floppy bag (1) which can be made of any 

usual fabric, nonwoven fabric, either of natural or 
synthetic fibers or of a combination thereof, or of sheets 

of fibrous material, either synthetic or natural, the wefts 
of which present by themselves a sufficient porosity, or 

which are provided with microholes or normal holes with a 
predeterminated size lesser than the granulometry of the 

powder compounds and with a predeterminated ratio between 
the pores total area and the walls area. 
A device according to claims 1 or 2, characterized in 
that the openable closure means (2, 3, 4) are formed by 

 
closure strings guided around the opening of the small bag 

(1). 
A device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the small bag (1) presents a tubular 

edge (2) which surrounds the opening and is open on 
diametrically opposed sides and inside which are arranged 

strings (3, 4) closed on themselves, and which both surround 
the opening, so that the closing take place pulling the 

strings in opposite directions. 
A dispenser according to one or more preceding 
claims, characterized in that the small bag (1) is realized 

as a flat envelope which is open at a peripheral edge of its 
faces.
