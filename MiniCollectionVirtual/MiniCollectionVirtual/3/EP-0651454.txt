<ABSTRACT>
Polymer-based amorphous compositions are extruded by a molten process in the form of thin films directly onto the positive electrode of an entirely solid lithium battery. This procedure has numerous advantages compared with the solvent method (speed, cost, interface quality, no recycling and environmental problems).

Process for coating a solid polymeric electrolyte 
onto the positive electrode of an entirely solid lithium 

battery, characterized in that an extrudable electrolyte 
composition, which is at least partially amorphous, based 

on homopolymers, copolymers or terpolymers with or 
without lithium salt and without liquid plasticizers, is 

introduced into an extruder, the said composition is 
melt-extruded in the form of a thin film of electrolyte, 

with a uniform thickness of between about 10 µm and about 
30 µm, and the said thin film is spread directly, at the 

extruder outlet, onto a positive electrode film prepared 
beforehand. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the positive electrode film is passed under the 

extruder die during spreading of the said thin film of 
electrolyte. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the positive electrode film is passed through at a 

speed of between about 5 m/min and about 10 m/min. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the positive electrode film passes through at a 

speed of about 10 m/min. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the extruder is heated to a temperature of between 

about 50°C and about 200°C. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the extruder temperature is about 160°C for crystalline 

polymer/salt mixtures and about 80°C for amorphous 

polymer/salt mixtures. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the said composition is extruded through a die 

capable of producing a film which is between about 10 µm 
and about 30 µm in thickness. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the positive electrode is prepared separately, for 

example via a solvent route. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that the extruded composition contains a copolymer of 
ethylene oxide and of an amorphous cyclic ether oxide in 

the presence or absence of a suitable lithium salt. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the extruded composition contains at least one 

crystalline polymer with a suitable added salt or a 
suitable solid additive which can make the polymer 

partially amorphous. 
Process according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that a lithium salt which is electrochemically compatible 

and which presents no handling risks is added to the 
crystalline polymer. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the extruded composition consists of homopolymers or 

copolymers derived from one or more monomers comprising 
at least one hetero atom capable of giving bonds of 

donor-receptor type with the cation of a suitable lithium 
salt. 
Process according to Claim 12, characterized in 
that the lithium salt is chosen from lithium terfluorosulphonimide 

(TFSI) or lithium bis perhaloacyl or -sulphonylimide 
(TFSM). 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the positive electrode film is passed through at a 

slightly higher speed than the speed of the film leaving 
the extruder so as to obtain, by drawing, a thin film of 

polymer of desired thickness on the positive electrode 
film. 
Process according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that the thin film leaves the extruder at a speed of 

between about 5 m/min and about 10 m/min. 
Process according to Claim 15, characterized in 
that the said speed is about 10 m/min. 
Process according to Claim 15, characterized in 
that the thin film leaves the extruder at a speed slightly 

less than 10 m/min, whereas the positive electrode 
film passes through at a speed equal to at least 

10 m/min.
