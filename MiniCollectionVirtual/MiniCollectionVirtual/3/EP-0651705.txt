<ABSTRACT>
In order to increase the reliability of a braking system with electronic control of the braking-force distribution, the invention calls for the front wheels (VR, VL) to be acted on, during braking, by a short pressure-reduction pulse which is negligible for the braking process, and the reaction of the front wheels to the pressure-reduction pulse is determined. If the reaction indicates an imbalance between, or a fault in, the front-wheel brakes, the limitation on the pressure increase in the brakes on the rear wheels (HR, HL), which is a result of the control of the brake-force distribution, is removed. The rear wheels thus provide, in this situation, an increased contribution to the braking process.

A method of enhancing the reliability in operation of a brake 
system with electronic brake force distribution (EBKV), in 

which the difference between the slip of the front wheels and 
the slip of the rear wheels serves as a control quantity, and 

in which the pressure rise in the rear-wheel brakes is 
limited,
characterized
 in that the reaction of the front 
wheels (VR, VL) to a variation in the pressure introduced 

into the front-wheel brakes is tested in regular intervals or 
in dependence on recurrent events, and in that when a 

reaction occurs which is below a predetermined limit value, 
the limitation of the pressure rise in the wheel brakes of 

the rear wheels (HR, HL) as an effect of the electronic brake 
force distribution control is eliminated. 
A method as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that, during a braking 
operation, the braking pressure at a front wheel (VR, VL) is 

reduced by one or several short braking pressure reduction 
pulses, and the change in the wheel rotational behaviour as 

a reaction to this pressure reduction is determined and is 
evaluated to judge the function of the brakes. 
A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized
 in that test pulses or braking 
pressure reduction pulses are applied consecutively to both 

front wheels (VR, VL) and the reaction of the wheel 
rotational behaviour to the pulses is evaluated.  

 
A method of enhancing the reliability in operation of a brake 
system with electronic brake force distribution (EBKV) 

including a control threshold for the commencement of the 
electronic brake force distribution control, in which the 

difference between the slip of the front wheels and the slip 
of the rear wheels serves as a control quantity, and in which 

the pressure rise in the rear-wheel brakes is limited,
characterized
 in that the reaction of the front 
wheels (VR, VL) to a variation in the pressure introduced 

into the front-wheel brakes is tested by means of test pulses 
in regular intervals or in dependence on recurrent events, 

and in that on occurrence of a reaction which is below a 
predetermined limit value, the slip threshold, i.e. the 

difference between the brake slip of the front wheels and the 
brake slip of the rear wheels which determines the 

commencement of the electronic brake force distribution 
control, is raised by a predetermined, invariable amount or 

by a value which depends on the reaction of the front wheels 
to the braking pressure variation. 
A method as claimed in claim 4,
characterized
 in that the control thresholds 
for the commencement of the electronic brake force distribution 

control are varied in dependence on the reaction of 
the wheel rotational behaviour to the test pulses, and in 

that the electronic brake force distribution control is 
disabled when a predetermined limit value of the reaction of 

the wheel rotational behaviour to the variation of the 
pressure introduced into the front-wheel brake is exceeded, 

i.e. upon total malfunction of a front-wheel brake or 
considerable reduction of the brake effect.
