<ABSTRACT>
An optical hybrid switch is specified which, under voltage control, conducts a light flux fed via an incoming passive optical waveguide (1) to at least one of two outgoing passive optical waveguides (1, 1a). The hybrid switch according to the invention preferably uses an NLO (non-linear optical) polymer as electrooptically active component. The increased attenuation connected with the use of NLO polymer is kept low in this case by feeding the incoming optical waveguide (1) further as one of the outgoing optical waveguides without interruption. In the event of driving the light flux over to the other outgoing optical waveguide (1a), the light is coupled out by means of an adjustable coupler (6) into an electrooptically active waveguide structure (5) and, after the shortest possible guide path, coupled into the other outgoing passive waveguide (1a) via a further coupler (8) adjusted in a fixed manner.

<CLAIMS>
Optical hybrid switch for the voltage-controlled 
transfer of light of the visible or nonvisible spectrum 

supplied via an incoming passive optical waveguide to at 
least one of two outgoing passive waveguides, comprising an 

electrooptically active waveguide structure deposited on a 
substrate and coupled to the passive waveguides and which 

has at least one coupler which can be adjusted by applying 
an electrical voltage and acts as an optical splitter,
 
characterized in that the incoming passive optical 

waveguide (1) is continued without interruption as one of 
the outgoing waveguides, in that the electrooptically 

active waveguide structure (5) forms, on the one hand, with 
the continuous passive optical waveguide (1), a coupler (6) 

which functions as optical splitter and can be adjusted by 
applying an electrical voltage and, on the other hand, with 

the other outgoing waveguide (1a), a permanently adjusted 
coupler (8). 
Optical hybrid switch according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the electrooptically active structure 

(5) is composed of NLO polymer. 
Optical hybrid switch according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
 
characterized in that the passive waveguides (1, 1a) are 

embedded in the substrate (9, 10) and the electrooptically 
active structure (5) is deposited on the substrate (9, 10) 

as ribbed waveguide (12) and is so disposed thereon that, 
in the areas in which couplers (6, 8) are to be formed, it 

extends above the passive optical waveguides (1, 1a) and in 
areas in which adjustable couplers (6) are to be formed, it 

is additionally flanked by coplanarly disposed electrodes 
(14). 
Optical hybrid switch according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
 
characterized in that the passive optical waveguides are  

 
embedded in the substrate with the electrooptically active 

structure so as to lie in one plane and in that electrodes 
are deposited above and below the optically active 

structure. 
Optical hybrid switch according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it is used within a 

multiplicity of further similar optical hybrid switches 
which are connected together in a cascade-like manner.
