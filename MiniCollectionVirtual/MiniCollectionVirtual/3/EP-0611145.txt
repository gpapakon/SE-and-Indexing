<ABSTRACT>
A first region diffused with a first diffusion 
material containing at least one element and a second 

region diffused (3c,3d) with a second diffusion material 
containing at least another element are formed in a 

substrate. At least part of the second region overlaps (3a,3b) 
part of the first region. A region of the first region 

which does not overlap (4) the second region has a 
refractive index higher than that of a region where the 

first region overlaps the second region and that of the 
substrate. The region of the first region which does 

not overlap the second region serves as a core (4) for 
propagating a light beam. The region where the first 

region overlaps (3a,3b) the second region and the region of the 
substrate (1a) not diffused with the first and second 

diffusion materials serve as a clad.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical 
waveguide. In recent years, optical waveguides have received 
a great deal of attention in various application 
fields. This is because use of an optical waveguide 
can provide a smaller and lighter optical system and 
eliminate the necessity of adjustment of the optical 
axis. Optical waveguides are classified into a single 
mode waveguide, a double mode waveguide, and a 
multimode waveguide in accordance with a difference 
between the refractive index of a core and that of a 
clad, the width and depth of the waveguide, and a 
refractive index distribution. In a single mode 
waveguide, only a 0th-order mode is excited. In a 
double mode waveguide, two modes, i.e., 0th- and 
1st-order modes are excited. In a multimode waveguide, 
three or more modes (0th-order mode, 1st-order mode, 
2nd-order mode and more) are excited. In an optical waveguide having a waveguide 
structure both in a direction of width and in a 
direction of depth, these modes are individually  
 
excited in the direction of width and in the direction 
of depth in the order of 0th-, 1st-, 2nd-order 
modes.... Conventionally, in a known waveguide, a region 
having a high refractive index is formed by diffusing 
an element in part of a substrate, the region having a 
high refractive index is used as a core, and the 
substrate is used as a clad. However, in the optical waveguide having a core 
formed by diffusing an element in part of the 
substrate, the width and depth of the core are 
determined by the diffusion rate of the element. For 
this reason, it is difficult to manufacture a waveguide 
having arbitrary maximum mode number in both the 
direction of width and the direction of depth. For example, when diffusion progresses at the same 
rate in the direction of width and in the direction of 
depth, a waveguide having a narrow and deep core cannot 
be manufactured. It is thus hard to manufacture a 
waveguide having two modes in the direction of depth 
and one mode in the direction of width. In applications of optical waveguides to various 
apparatuses, use of a double mode waveguide capable of 
utilizing the interference of the 0th- and 1st-order 
modes allows wider applications. However, because the 
maximum mode number in the width and depth directions  
 
of the waveguide can hardly be controlled, the 
waveguides cannot be easily applied to apparatuses. The present invention has been made in 
consideration of the above situation, and has as its 
object to provide an optical waveguide
