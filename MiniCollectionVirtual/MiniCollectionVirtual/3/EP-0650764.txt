<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a spray device intended to be mounted on a fluid dispenser connected to a reservoir; of the type comprising a head (1) provided with an expansion chamber (10) into which emerges the ejection orifice of the said dispenser; and which communicates via at least one outlet conduit (11) with a nozzle (2). According to the invention, the said nozzle consists of an articulated internal element (21) which is, at least partially, housed in the outlet conduit (11) and of an external element (22) fixed so as to bear in a sealed manner against the said internal element (21) in order to define, between their respective surfaces in contact, a system of swirling (turbulence-creating) channels communicating with the outlet conduit (11) and emerging on the outside via a spray orifice (220) made through the external element (22).

A spray device for mounting on a fluid dispenser connected to a
tank; the device being of the type comprising a head (1) provided

with an expansion chamber (10) into which the outlet orifice of said
dispenser opens out; the expansion chamber (10) communicating with a

nozzle (2) via at least one outlet duct (11);

   the device being characterized in that said nozzle is
constituted firstly by a hinged inner element (21) which is at least

partially received in the outlet duct (11) and which comprises a
central core (211) and a peripheral sleeve (212) disposed coaxially

and defining between them a dispensing enclosure (110) inside the
outlet duct (11), said core and sleeve being interconnected by at

least one transverse fin (210) that is elastically deformable to
enable said core (211) to move relative to said sleeve, and secondly

by an outer element (22) fixed to bear in sealed manner against said
inner element (21) so as to define between their respective

contacting surfaces a network of swirl-inducing channels
communicating with the outlet duct (11) and opening to the outside

via a spray orifice (220) formed through the outer element (22).
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that said
dispensing enclosure (110) is annular in section.
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that said
peripheral sleeve (212) is cylindrical, at least in part.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
said peripheral sleeve (212) is constituted by a cylindrical front

portion (212a) extended towards its back by a radial annular shoulder
(212b) that bears against the inside of a corresponding recess (111)

formed in the inner wall of the outlet duct (11).
A device according to claim 4, characterized in that the inside
face of the radial shoulder (212b) of the sleeve (212) is chamfered.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
said central core (211) is cylindro-conical. 
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
said central core (211) includes a front end (211a) provided with a

contact face for contacting the outer element (22) which extends in a
plane that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis

(X) of the inner element (21), and a back end (211b) having a profile
that is tapering and/or convex.
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
transverse fins (210) symmetrically interconnect the respective front

portions (211a, 212a) of the core (211) and of the sleeve (212).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
said outer element (22) is formed by a cup whose plane back face

comes into bearing contact against the respective front faces of the
core (211) and of the sleeve (212).
A device according to claims 4 and 8, characterized in that said
outer element (22) includes a cylindrical inner housing (221) adapted

to receive the front portion (212a) of said sleeve (212); the side
wall of said housing (221) terminating towards its back end in a

collar (222) which is for fixing against the inside wall of the
outlet duct (11) and which comes into abutment against the radial

shoulder (212b) of said sleeve of the inner element (21).
A device according to claim 10, characterized in that the outside
face of the front portion (212a) of the sleeve of the inner element

(21) fits closely in leakproof manner against the inside face of the
housing (221) of the outer element (22).
A device according to any preceding claim, characterized in that
said network of swirl-inducing channels is defined firstly by the

front and back faces respectively of the inner element (21) and of
the outer element (22), and secondly by an axial ring (20) split up

by grooves (200) formed on the front face (211a) of the core (211) of
the inner element (21) or on the back face of the outer element (22). 
A device according to claim 12, characterized in that said ring
(20) forms a contact abutment between the inner element (21) and the

outer element (22) and surrounds a central cavity (12) which is fed
from the outlet duct (11) via said grooves (200), and which opens

directly to the outside via the spray orifice (220).
A device according to claim 13, characterized in that said
grooves (200) pass through said ring (20) in such a manner as to

produce turbulence inside said central cavity (12).
A device according to claim 13 or 14, characterized in that said
axial ring (20) is made on the front face (211a) of said core of the

inner element (21) and the end wall of the central cavity (12) is
