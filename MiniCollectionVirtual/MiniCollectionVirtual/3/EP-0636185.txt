<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for denaturing native double-stranded nucleic acid material into its individual strands in an electrochemical cell. The process is an electrical treatment of the nucleic acid with a voltage applied to the nucleic acid material by an electrode. The process employs a promoter which is an inorganic multivalent cation such as magnesium ions to speed denaturation. The process may be used in the detection of nucleic acid by hybridrising with a labelled probe or in the amplification of DNA by a polymerase chain reaction or ligase chain reaction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for the treatment of
nucleic acid material in order to effect a complete or partial
change from double stranded form to single stranded form and
to processes of amplifying or detecting nucleic acids
involving such denaturation processes.Double stranded DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and DNA/RNA
(ribonucleic acid) and RNA/RNA complexes in the familiar
double helical configuration are stable molecules that, in
vitro, require aggressive conditions to separate the
complementary strands of the nucleic acid. Known methods that
are commonly employed for strand separation require the use
of high temperatures of at least 60° celsius and often 100°
celsius for extended periods of ten minutes or more or use an
alkaline pH of 11 or higher. Other methods include the use of
helicase enzymes such as Rep protein of E.coli that can
catalyse the unwinding of the DNA in an unknown way, or
binding proteins such as 32-protein of E.coli phage T4 that
act to stabilise the single stranded form of DNA. The
denatured single stranded DNA produced by the known processes
of heat or alkali is used commonly for hybridisation studies
or is subjected to amplification cycles.US Patent No 4683202 (Kary B Mullis et al, assigned to
Cetus Corporation) discloses a process for amplifying and
detecting a target nucleic acid sequence contained in a
nucleic acid or mixture thereof by separating the
complementary strands of the nucleic acid, hybridising with
specific oligonucleotide primers, extending the primers with
a polymerase to form complementary primer extension products
and then using those extension products for the further
synthesis of the desired nucleic acid sequence by allowing
hybridisation with the specific oligonucleotides primers to
take place again. The process can be carried out repetitively
to generate large quantities of the required nucleic acid
sequence from even a single molecule of the starting material. 
Separation of the complementary strands of the nucleic acid
is achieved preferably by thermal denaturation in successive
cycles, since only the thermal process offers simple
reversibility of the denaturation process to reform the double
stranded nucleic acid, in order to continue the amplification
cycle. However the need for thermal cycling of the reaction
mixture limits the speed at which the multiplication process
can be carried out owing to the slowness of typical heating
and cooling systems. It also requires the use of special heat
resistant polymerase enzymes from thermophilic
