<ABSTRACT>
Game apparatus has a transparent enclosure (1) 
containing a die (2) having distinct faces (21). The die 

can be thrown in the enclosure to tumble freely and fall 
on any one of its faces (21). The floor of the enclosure 

has a sensing surface (31) having radiation 
emitters/sensors (A-E) aligned with possible locations of 

distinguishing spots of the die faces. By reading the die 
face which lands against the sensing surface (31), the 

orientation of the die (2) and in particular the value of 
its displayed upper surface can be identified and 

displayed electronically. Also disclosed is the use of 
sloping guide plates (50) to guide the die (2) down into 

alignment with the sensing surface. Such guides may be 
used also with other forms of face identification, using 

e.g. capacitive or inductive face identification.

<DESCRIPTION>
This specification relates to devices and machines 
incorporating a game in which one or more dice are 
involved. In particular aspects, the disclosure is concerned 
with methods and devices for sensing the condition of a 
die automatically after the die has been thrown. UK-A-2147510 describes a game machine incorporating a 
die which is read electronically. To enable reading, the 
die is constrained by mounting it on a vertical shaft. 
This spoils the effect of free tumbling which is desired 
with dice The value shown on the die is measured 
indirectly, using an indicator which rotates with the 
shaft. EP A 426301 describes an amusement machine in which a 
die is tumbled by an upward air flow in a translucent 
tube. Each face of the die carries a resonant circuit of 
a characteristic frequency, and the die is read by 
identifying the resonant frequency of the downward face 
using a variable-frequency coil. In this application, we describe some new 
developments and techniques relating to games using dice, 
and method and means for reading dice. In one general aspect, this application relates to a 
game device which has a die enclosure, a die in the 
enclosure, means for throwing the die in the enclosure so 
as to change its orientation on a random or quasi-random  
 
basis, and means for determining the orientation or 
condition of the die in the enclosure after the throwing. In one independent aspect, we propose a method of and 
apparatus for reading a die in which radiation reflected 
from a surface of the die, and most preferably that 
surface of the die which faces downwardly after throwing, 
is sensed to identify that surface and hence identify the 
displayed surface (usually the uppermost surface after 
throwing). This may be done in various ways, depending on the 
nature of the die. In one technique, a sensor surface 
against which the thrown die lies has a plurality of 
radiation sensors at predetermined positions, to detect 
selectively whether radiation - e.g. IR or visible light - 
is reflected at those positions. This technique is 
particularly suitable for a die which has characteristic 
surface patterns, such as the conventional patterns of 
from one to six spots on surfaces of a cube. Radiation 
sensors are positioned at sufficient of the locations 
corresponding to such spots or other markings as will 
enable every face of the die to be distinguished. One or more radiation emitters may also be provided, 
to direct radiation at the die face. In one preferred 
version, each sensor is

Game apparatus comprising an enclosure (1), a die (2) 
in the enclosure, means (40,41) for tumbling the die (2) 

in the enclosure to fall on any one of a plurality of 
distinct faces (21) thereof, and sensing means (31) for 

Sensing radiation reflected from a said face (21) of the 
fallen die (2) to distinguish that face and give a 

corresponding output signal identifying the orientation of 
the fallen die (2). 
Game apparatus according to claim 1 in which the 
sensing means (31) comprises a sensor surface on which the 

die (2) falls, the sensor surface having one or a 
plurality of radiation sensors (A-E). 
Game apparatus according to claim 2 in which the 
faces (21) of the die (2) are mutually distinguished by 

different patterns of markings, the markings having 
reflectivity different from the face background, and 

plural radiation sensors (A-E) are at respective positions 
on the sensor surface corresponding to possible locations 

of those markings. 
Game apparatus according to claim 3 in which the die

five and six reflectivity contrasting spots respectively, 
each spot being aligned with one of nine possible spot 

 
positions relative to the face shape.
