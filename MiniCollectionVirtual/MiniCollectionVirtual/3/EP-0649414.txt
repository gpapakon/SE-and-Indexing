<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to diarylmethyl piperazine and diarylmethyl
piperidine compounds having utility as receptor-binding species, e.g., as
conjugates in agonist/antagonist pairs for verifying/assaying receptor and
neurotransmitter function. The compounds of the invention include benzhydryl
piperazine compounds useful as mu and/or delta receptor opioid compounds
mediating analgesia, as well as compounds having utility in combatting drug
addiction, alcohol addiction, drug overdose, mental illness, urinary incontinence,
cough, lung edema, diarrhea, depression, and cognitive, respiratory, and gastrointestinal
disorders.In the study of opioid biochemistry, a variety of endogenous opioid
compounds and non-endogenous opioid compounds has been identified. In this
effort, significant research has been focused on understanding the mechanism of
opioid drug action, particularly as it relates to cellular and differentiated tissue
opiate receptors.Opioid drugs typically are classified by their binding selectivity in respect of
the cellular and differentiated tissue receptors to which a specific drug species
binds as a ligand. These receptors include mu (µ), delta (δ), sigma (σ) and kappa
(κ) receptors.The well-known narcotic opiates, such as morphine and its analogs, are
selective for the opiate mu receptor. Mu receptors mediate analgesia, respiratory
depression, and inhibition of gastrointestinal transit. Kappa receptors mediate
analgesia and sedation. Sigma receptors mediate various biological activities. The existence of the opioid delta receptor is a relatively recent discovery
which followed the isolation and characterization of endogenous enkephalin
peptides which are ligands for the delta receptor. Research in the past decade has
produced significant information about the delta receptor, but a clear picture of its
function has not yet emerged. Delta receptors mediate analgesia, but do not
appear to inhibit intestinal transit in the manner characteristic of mu receptors.Opioid agents frequently are characterized as either agonists or antagonists.
Agonists and antagonists are agents which recognize and bind to receptors,
affecting (either initiating or blocking) biochemlcal/physiological sequences, a
process known as transduction. Agonists inhibit or suppress neurotransmitter
outputs in tissues containing receptors, e.g., inhibiting pain responses, or affecting
other output-related phenomena. Antagonists also bind to receptors, but do not
inhibit neurotransmitter outputs. Thus, antagonists bind to

organometallic reagent, and

reacting said intermediate arylmetallic compound with an alkylating agent to yield a
compound of formula (IA) wherein Y is alkyl or acyl; and
(M) converting a compound of formula (IA) wherein Y is carboxylic acid to a
compound of formula (IA) wherein Y is alkoxyaminocarbonyl, by a Curtius

rearrangement reaction;

and thereafter, or simultaneously therewith, effecting one or more of the following
optional conversions:


(i) removing any remaining protecting groups;
(ii) when a compound of formula (IA) is formed, converting it into a
pharmaceutically acceptable ester, amide, or salt ther
eof;
(iii) when a physiologically functional derivative of a compound of formula
