coated on at least one side with (a) a laminar grain 

silver halide emulsion and (b) a separate hydrophillic 
colloid layer containing a developing agent for silver 

halide in an amount corresponding to at least 0.5 moles 
per mole of the silver coated on that side of the base.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to medical X-ray films and to
their processing. In particular the invention relates to
medical X-ray films having significantly reduced
processing time.Medical X-ray films typically comprise a transparent
substrate coated on one or both sides with a light
sensitive silver halide emulsion. Exposure is effected
by means of fluorescent screens placed in contact with
the emulsion-coated side(s) of the film. The screens
absorb a proportion of the X-rays impinging on them and
re-emit the energy as visible light, normally in the
green portion of the spectrum, and the emulsions are
sensitised accordingly. Laminar grain emulsions are
increasingly used for X-ray films because of their
ability to reduce crossover, i.e. the exposure of an
emulsion on one side of the base by light emitted by the
screen on the other side of the base. Although crossover
decreases the overall exposure required to achieve a
given Dmax, it degrades significantly the image
resolution. Laminar emulsions have the desirable
properties of reducing crossover without undue loss of
speed. Even in the case of single-sided X-ray films,
laminar emulsions are preferred because they enable the
use of reduced amounts of silver. Dye-containing
underlayers situated between the base and the emulsions
are also frequently used to reduce crossover and halation
in double-sided films. In single-sided films, an
antihalation layer is normally coated on the back.
Protective layers, e.g. of hardened gelatin, are normally
coated on top of the emulsions to improve the durability
of the film.The exposed films are typically processed by
immersion in warm (about 35°C) alkaline developer
solution containing developing agents e.g. hydroquinone,
phenidone etc., stabiliser e.g. sulphite ion,
antifoggants and a hardener e.g. a dialdehyde, such as,
glutaraldehyde. Thereafter, the film is fixed, washed 
and dried, the entire process taking in the region of 90
to 110 seconds dry-to-dry, or longer. There is
increasing interest in reducing this time to less than 60
seconds, preferably less than 45 seconds, in the
interests of improved productivity, especially during
mass screenings. Possible means for reducing the
processing time include the use of more concentrated
developer solutions and/or higher temperatures, both of
which are undesirable from an environmental point of
view.The incorporation of developing agents into
photographic elements is disclosed widely in the
literature. In most cases the developers are
incorporated in the emulsion layer itself,
