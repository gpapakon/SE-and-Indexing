<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for producing 
fluorine-containing copolymers, which can be used for 
fluorine-containing copolymers free from coloration and are 
soluble in organic solvents and quickly curable at ordinary 
temperature. It also relates to fluorine-containing 
copolymer compositions and more particularly to fluorine-containing 
copolymer compositions which can be used as 
coating capable of forming coating films excellent in 
adhesion to substrates. In the fields of applications of exterior coatings to 
architectural structures, wheeled vehicles, ships, 
aircraft, etc., there are utilized high-quality polyester 
or acryl type exterior coatings, since the coatings used 
for the purpose intended are required to have excellent 
weathering resistance and performance properties. However, 
outdoor durable years of the coatings are short and even  
 
the above-mentioned high-quality coatings will lose their 
fine appearance and substrate protective properties in 
several years. Because of their being excellent in thermal and 
chemical stability, weathering resistance, water 
resistance, chemical resistance, solvent resistance, non-adhesive 
properties, low friction characteristics and water 
repellency, fluorine containing polymers are suitable for 
use as surface treatment agents for various kinds of 
substrates or base materials. However, on account of their 
excellent properties as mentioned above, conventional known 
fluorine-containing polymers are difficult to use as 
coating materials because they are difficultly soluble in 
organic solvents and hard to form films thereof. For 
instance, most of coating materials of fluorine-containing 
polymers known at present are powder coatings except for 
PVdF (polyvinylidene fluoride) which is used as an organic 
solvent dispersible type coating by utilizing its 
properties of being soluble in specific solvents at 
elevated temperatures. Moreover, since coating materials 
of fluorine-containing polymers mentioned above require 
high temperature baking at the time when their films are 
formed, the field in which they are used is limited to such  
 
places where heating equipments can be arranged. 
Furthermore, such heating equipments and baking step as 
required for the utilization of these coating materials are 
undesirable from the standpoint of the safety of workers 
engaged in the coating operation or the work environment. 
Under the circumstance, various attempts have been made in 
recent years to develop fluorine-containing polymers which
