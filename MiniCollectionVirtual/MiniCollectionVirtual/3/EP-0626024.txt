<ABSTRACT>
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system as illustrated, consisting of a hitch body (4) which is locked onto the bucket or accessory (5). This is carried out by means of the locking of a half tube section (8) and the end plate (7) against and between the tubular chassis section of the bucket (1), and the locking plate (6). Two locking pins (9) are powered through the two holes in the locking plate (6) to lock the hitch body to the bucket. Subsequent different buckets can be easily fitted to the same excavator by unlocking the hitch from the bucket and then locking the hitch on to the new bucket.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coupling system for attaching different digging 
buckets and accessories on to an excavator. EP-A-0 273 828 for example discloses an excarvator bucket attachment 
coupling system, where the hitch part is wedged between a locking plate and a 
tubular chassis of the bucket. On all excavators there is a requirement to attach different sizes and shapes 
of digging buckets and other attachments. Usually only one of these is 
attached to the machine at any time. The traditional method of attaching 
these excavator buckets is by removing the main two connecting pins ("Bucket 
pins"), and re-positioning the arm of the excavator in line with the new 
attachment or bucket, and re-fitting and securing these bucket pins. Depending upon the nature of the work that the excavator is involved with, 
this changing process could be carried out up to 10 times in any one day. 
This process is awkward, time consuming and often results in damage to that 
part of the excavator and bucket. In addition, buckets manufactured to fit one make and size of excavator will 
not usually fit any others (this is due to different bucket pin sizes and 
widths and geometry of the bucket rotation mechanism). With a "Bucket 
coupling system", once this has been fitted to the excavator, all sizes of 
bucket can be fitted to all makes of excavator, (provided that it is in the 
same weight class). This is of considerable assistance and saves stocking 
many different sizes and type of buckets. There is therefore a requirement for a quick and easy method of changing 
excavator buckets, or 'bucket hitch'. Other types of coupling systems have 
been designed and produced in the past, in an attempt to find a solution to 
this problem.  
 The MASTERHITCH excavator bucket coupling system as described is a simple, 
quick and easy method of attaching and removing different buckets to the same 
excavator. The MASTERHITCH works by having the main top chassis member of 
the bucket or attachment made in the form of a tubular section. There is a 
back plate welded to this tube, forming the back of the bucket. There is a 
slot of fixed dimensions cut into the back plate in the centre of the bucket 
and adjacent to the tube. The hitch part attached to the excavator has a 
fixed length of steel tube, cut in half down its length fixed to it. It is 
mounted between two hook sections, which locate in to the fixed slot in the 
back plate of the bucket. This half steel tube is rotated around the steel tubular section of the 
bucket until

<CLAIMS>
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, where the hitch part (4), 
incorporating a steel tube (8) cut in half down its length, locates over the 

main tubular chassis of the bucket (5), two hook sections (3) of the hitch (4) 
locate into a rectangular hole of fixed dimensions on the bucket (5), the 

hitch (4) is locked into place by rotating the hitch around the tubular 
chassis (1) until the end plate of the hitch (4) lines up with the locking plate (6) 

fixed to the bucket (5) or attachment, two locking pins (9) are then powered 
through holes in the end plate (7) and locking plate (6), this wedges the hitch (4) 

between the locking plate (6) and the tubular chassis (1). 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where the hitch is guided on to the bucket by two tapered curved hooks 

which locate into a slot in the bucket. 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where the locking pins (9) are powered hydraulically by a self contained 

hydraulic ram (12), fed from the hydraulics of the excavator. 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where the locking pins are prevented from accidental withdrawal by a 

locking bar inserted manually. 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where the whole mechanism is totally sealed against all ingress of 

dirt, water and the like.  
 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where the hitch has an integral tested hook (13) for the attachment of 

lifting chains and slings. 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where there are two guiding "Wings" fixed to the tubular section of 

the bucket to enable simple location of the hooks on the hitch body (4) into 
the rectangular hole in the bucket. 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where location and sideways movement of the hitch body against the 

bucket is prevented by the extension of the hitch body (4) on either side of 
the locking plate (6). 
An excavator bucket and attachment coupling system, as claimed in claim 
1, where an electronic switch senses the movement of the locking pins and 

moving plate, and sends an electric signal to the instruments mounted in 
the cab of the excavator.
