<ABSTRACT>
Injection units of die-casting machines operate as hydraulically driven multi-phase injection systems, exerting different pressures on the cast material in different phases of the casting process. The casting plunger of an injection unit according to the invention is driven by at least one electric motor. The drive is preferably provided by means of a multi-stage servo motor interacting with a multi-roller spindle.

<CLAIMS>
Injection unit for a die-casting machine,
with a plunger for pressing the casting material

into the mould, which plunger is driven by an
electromotor 
via
 a spindle which cooperates with a
nut, characterised in that the nut (25) for the

spindle (13) is connected securely to the rotors
(23, 24) of the electromotor (20) and is in

engagement with a threaded section (14) of the
spindle (13); and in that the rotors are formed as

a protective casing which surrounds the threaded
section (14) of the spindle (13) completely.
Injection unit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the spindle (13) is a

circulating ball spindle.
Injection unit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the piston rod of the

plunger is formed as a spindle (13).
Injection unit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the spindle (13) extends

through an aperture (15) of a casing (11) of the
casting chamber and is connected axially to a

piston rod (16), which is connected to the
plunger. 
Injection unit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the spindle (13) is disposed

coaxial to the axis of the rotors (23, 24) and is
conducted to the exterior in a sealed manner

through an aperture (30) in the face of one of the
rotors (24).
Injection unit according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the axial length of the

inner hollow chamber of the rotors (23, 24) is
coordinated with the maximum stroke of the spindle

(13) in such a manner that the threaded section
(14) of the spindle (13) always remains inside the

protective casing which is formed by the rotors
(23, 24).
Injection unit according to any one of
Claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a gear

reducer is provided, this being connected between
the electromotor (20) and the plunger.
Injection unit according to any one of
Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the

electromotor (20) is formed as a multiple stage
drive. 
Injection unit according to any one of
Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that a water

cooler is provided for the electromotor (20).
