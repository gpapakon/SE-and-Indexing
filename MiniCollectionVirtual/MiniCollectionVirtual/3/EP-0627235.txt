<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a medical system (2) in which 
information and energy are transmitted between a medical 

device (4) and living tissue or between medical devices (4, 
12) in a safe and noise-free manner when at least one 

optical conductor (10, 22) is connected to the medical 
device (4) and the living tissue (6) or an additional 

medical device. With the aid of conversion means for 
converting optical signals into electrical signals and vice-versa, 

energy and information can be transmitted by optical 
signals in the optical conductor (10, 22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a medical system, intended to be
connected to living tissue, comprising a medical device.A plurality of different medical devices, such as pacemakers
and defibrillators, are currently employed in systems for
connection to living tissue for sensing tissue function or
treating said tissue. The devices can be implantable or
extracorporeal. The devices are connected to living tissue
by metallic conductors. When a plurality of devices are
utilized in a system connected to the living tissue, the
incorporated devices can even be interconnected with metallic
conductors so information can be exchanged by the
devices.Metallic leads can cause problems, especially in implanted
systems. A pacemaker conductor could e.g. pick up a defibrillation
pulse, resulting in spurious detection or even
damage to pacemaker electronics. The metallic conductors are
usually arranged in insulated sheaths made of a polymer,
such as silicone, to keep them from having any effect on
surrounding tissue which is not to be sensed or stimulated.
This means that such leads cannot be made as thin as would
be desirable.One object of the present invention is to achieve a medical
system, as noted above, in which the number of metallic conductors
is minimized.One such medical system is achieved in accordance with the
invention in that the medical system further comprises at
least one optical conductor with a proximal end and a distal
end, connected to the medical device at the proximal end, a
first conversion means, located at the proximal end of the 
optical conductor for converting optical signals into electrical
signals and/or electrical signals into optical
signals, a second conversion means, located at the distal
end of the optical conductor, for converting optical signals
into electrical signals and/or electrical signals into optical
signals, and a function unit, connected to the distal
end of the optical conductor, whereby signals are transmittable
between the medical device and the function unit
via the optical conductor.By employing an optical conductor for carrying signals and
energy, metallic conductors will not be needed for most
connections between medical devices and living tissue and
between different medical devices.A refinement of the system is achieved in accordance with
the invention in that the function unit comprises a first
electrode surface and a second electrode surface, connected
to the second conversion means so electrical signals generated
by the second conversion means are delivered to the
living
