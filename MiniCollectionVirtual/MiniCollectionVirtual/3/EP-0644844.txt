<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and a vessel for 
offshore oil loading, wherein the vessel comprises a number of 
centre tanks arranged in the longitudinal direction of the 
vessel, and a number of wing tanks located in pairs on either 
side of respective centre tanks, a loading line being connected 
to the centre tanks via respective valves, and adjacent centre 
tanks being connected to each other via bulkhead valves. In connection with offshore oil loading a part of the 
load will be lost to the atmosphere because of de-gassing from 
the liquid surface. As an example, in a typical buoy loading in 
the North Sea, there may be lost approximately 200 tons per 
loading of tankers of about 120 000 tons. The release of gas 
mainly is due to splashing and stirring of crude oil in the 
loading tanks, and occurring pressure drop in the hydrocarbon 
load during the handling thereof. Measurements have shown that the extent of the de-gassing 
is proportional to the time before the tanks are full, 
and the period of the condition of standing waves (resonance) in 
the tanks. In addition, loads on the tank structure will be 
increasing with the period of standing waves. It is therefore 
essential to fill the individual tanks as quickly as possible, 
both to reduce the de-gassing period and therewith the total 
spill of gases, and to reduce loads on the tank structures during 
loading. Thus, the object of the invention is to provide a 
method and a vessel resulting in a substantial reduction of the 
degassing during loading, and also in a substantial reduction of 
loads on the tank structures. It is also an object of the invention to provide a 
vessel having a tank arrangement which has technical and economic 
advantages, especially with direct loading of tankers on the 
field. For the achievement of the above-mentioned objects 
there is provided a method of the introductorily stated type 
which, according to the invention, is characterized by the steps 
of  
 
a) firstly effecting filling of a desired number of the 
centre tanks, these being substantially narrower and having a 
correspondingly smaller volume than the wing tanks, b) thereafter opening bulkhead valves between a centre 
tank and an appurtenant wing tank pair and sluicing out oil from 
the centre tanks into the two wing tanks by means of the static 
pressure from the centre tanks, the bulkhead valves between the 
centre tanks being open, so that the wing tank pair is filled as 
quickly as possible by suitable operation of the bulkhead valves 
between
