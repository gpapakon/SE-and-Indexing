<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of a composition comprising 
cationic fabric softeners, preferably quaternary ammonium 

esters and (C₃-C₁₀) alkyl/aryl polyammonium salts. 
These polyammonium salts are used to replace partially or 
fully calcium chloride to aid the cationic fabric softeners 

in depositing on fabrics while reducing the inter-cationic 
interferences usually leading to low deposition densities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of a composition 
comprising cationic fabric softeners, preferably quaternary 
ammonium esters and (C₃-C₁₀) alkyl/aryl polyammonium salts. These polyammonium salts are used to replace partially or 
fully calcium chloride to aid the cationic fabric softeners 
in depositing on fabrics while reducing the inter-cationic 
interferences usually leading to low deposition densities. Compositions containing polyammonium salts and conventional 
fabric softeners are disclosed in US application 07/88/979. 
However, no mention of the use of these polyammonium salts 
as deposition density aid is disclosed in this document. 
FR-A-1581392 discloses diamine salts falling within the 
definition of the polyammonium salts of the present 
invention. However, these diamine salts are disclosed in 
the context of washing powders including anionic 
detergents. GB-A-2006237 discloses polymers comprising a monomere of 
alky-diamines. These monomeres also fall within the 
definition of the polyammonium salts of the present 
invention. The compositions disclosed are used in hair care 
formulations and the polymers derived from the polyammonium 
monomeres are said to have improved compatibility with 
anionic surfactants.  EP-A-69948 and JP-A-90012203 disclose polyammonium 
compounds in the context of fabric treatment compositions. 
However, no indication of these compounds falling within 
the definition of the present invention has been found. 
The problem underlying the present invention is to provide 
viscosity control and stability of fabric softening 
compositions, to increase the density of cations which can 
be deposited on a fabric fiber and, at the same time, to 
perform anionic scavenging for carry-over detergent from 
the main wash. These problems had all been solved 
individually before, however, their combination with the 
additional condition that no adverse effects in other 
characteristics of a fabric softener composition would be 
acceptable is the main objective of the present invention. It now has been found surprisingly that the use of soluble 
carbohydrate polyammonium salts replacing calcium chloride 
does satisfy the complex objective of the present 
invention. Therefore, the present invention relates to the 
use of soluble polyammonium salts for viscosity control, 
deposition density aid and anionic scavenging in rinse 
added fabric softening compositions. The fabric softening compositions comprise insoluble fabric 
softening agent and, at least 0.1 % by weight of a
