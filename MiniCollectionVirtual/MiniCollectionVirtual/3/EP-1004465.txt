<CLAIMS>
Side intrusion beam for impact protection of motor
vehicles, for example for doors or side walls or

bumpers, comprising a hollow profile with a
compression flange (1) and a tension flange (8),

the tension and compression flanges (1, 8) being
connected to each other by lateral webs (4, 5) of a

concave shape, the tension flange (8) being made
wider than the compression flange, and the

compression flange (1) having a concave shape,
characterized

in that
 the beam is produced by roll-forming from a
metal strip and the transitions between the tension

flange (8) and the webs (4, 5) are formed by
rounded portions (6, 7).
Side intrusion beam according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the transitions between the
compression flange (1) and the webs (4, 5) are

formed by rounded portions (2, 3).
Side intrusion beam according to Claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that
 the seam connecting the side
edges of the metal strip lies in the central region

of the compression flange (1). 
Side intrusion beam according to one of Claims 1 to
3, 
characterized in that
 the metal strip consists
of sheet of the same thickness.
Side intrusion beam according to one of Claims 1 to
4, 
characterized in that
 the metal strip consists
of steel sheet.
