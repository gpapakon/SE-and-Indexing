<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a fuel cell with a solid body (SOFC) or molten-salt electrolyte (MCFC). The anode of the fuel cell consists, according to the invention, of a solid mixture of tungsten carbide and an ionically conducting oxide such as yttrium-stabilised zirconium oxide (zirconium oxide fully stabilised by yttrium) or a doped alkaline earth cerate or thorate. The invention furthermore relates to a method for producing the anode. In order to form the solid mixture, a mixture of YSZ powder and WO3 is produced and this mixture is converted in a CO/CO2 atmosphere in the temperature range of 600-1000 DEG C into a YSZ-WC mixture.
