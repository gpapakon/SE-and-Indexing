<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new and improved 
drive mechanism whereby a motor driven drive roller 
frictionally engages a flat surface of an elongated driven 
member. A pressure roller is spring biased to bear against 
the driven member directly opposite the drive member. This invention comprises an improvement on US-A-4,539,854. 
In this reference there are two support rollers 
spaced longitudinally relative to the driven member on 
either side of the drive roller, one of the support rollers 
being spring biased. US-A-4378709 discloses the features of the preamble of claim 1 and shows a friction drive converting rotary 
to linear motion comprising a drive roller, first and 
second back-up rollers, a pressure roller and a driven 
member having a flat surface perpendicular to the line 
joining the axis of the drive and pressure rollers. The 
pressure roller is urged against the driven member by a 
spring. The present invention provides a friction drive 
converting rotary to linear motion comprising 
a housing, a drive roller mounted in said housing, first and second back-up rollers mounted in said 
housing, bearing against said drive roller on first and 
second lines, respectively, each parallel to the other and 
located on opposite sides of said drive roller, said drive 
roller and said back-up rollers having opposite ends 
rotatably mounted in said housing about axes fixed relative 
to each other drive means for turning said drive roller, a pressure roller having opposite ends,  
 a driven member having at least one flat surface 
perpendicular to a line joining axes of rotation of said 
drive roller and said pressure roller and parallel to said 
first and second lines and a second surface opposite said 
one flat surface, said drive roller frictionally engaging 
said one flat surface and said pressure roller engaging 
said second surface to cause reciprocable motion of said 
housing and said driven member relative to each other as 
said drive means turns said drive roller,  
   characterised in that there is provided a yoke within 
said housing having a pair of parallel arms in which said 
opposite ends of said pressure roller are rotatably 
mounted, pivot means pivoting said yoke to said housing 
about a single pivot axis parallel to the axis of rotation 
of said pressure roller, and resilient means comprising a 
single spring applying substantially equal pressure against 
both arms of said yoke at points remote from said pivot 
means. The present invention comprises an improvement on 
the prior art

<CLAIMS>
A friction drive converting rotary to linear motion 
comprising 


a housing (11,12,13) 
a drive roller (16) mounted in said housing 
(11,12,13), 
first and second back-up rollers (26) mounted in said 
housing (11,12,13), bearing against said drive roller (16) 

on first and second lines, respectively, each parallel to 
the other and located on opposite sides of said drive 

roller (16), said drive roller (16) and said back-up 
rollers (26) having opposite ends rotatably mounted in said 

housing (11,12,13) about axes fixed relative to each other 
drive means (17) for turning said drive roller (16), 
a pressure roller (28) having opposite ends, 
a driven member (18) having at least one flat surface 
perpendicular to a line joining axes of rotation of said 

drive roller (16) and said pressure roller (18) and 
parallel to said first and second lines and a second 

surface opposite said one flat surface, said drive roller 
(16) frictionally engaging said one flat surface and said 

pressure roller (18) engaging said second surface to cause 
reciprocable motion of said housing (11,12,13) and said 

driven member (18) relative to each other as said drive 
means (17) turns said drive roller (16), 
 
   characterised in that there is provided a yoke (31) 

within said housing (11,12,13) having a pair of parallel 
arms in which said opposite ends of said pressure roller 

(18) are rotatably mounted, pivot means (32) pivoting said 
yoke (31) to said housing (11,12,13) about a single pivot 

axis parallel to the axis of rotation of said pressure 
roller (18), and resilient means (33) comprising a single 

spring (33) applying substantially equal pressure against 
both arms of said yoke at points remote from said pivot 

means (32).  
 
A friction drive as claimed in claim 1 in which said 
second surface of said driven member (18) is flat and 

parallel to said one flat surface. 
A friction drive as claimed in any preceding claim in 
which said housing (11,12,13) comprises a plate (11) formed 

with a slot (14) parallel to said driven member (18) and 
which further comprises a connector (21) attached to said 

driven member (18) and extending through said slot (14). 
A friction drive as claimed in any preceding claim 
which further comprises a guide mounted in said housing 

(11,12,13) shaped to receive and support at least a portion 
of said driven member (12).
