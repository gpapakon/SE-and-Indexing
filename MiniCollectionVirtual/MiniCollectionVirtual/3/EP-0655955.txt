<ABSTRACT>
Sludges and slurries (e.g. oil, grease or paint based) are encapsulated into Fly Ash or similar particulate material by adding solvents to effect the encapsulation and absorption of the sludge. Subsequently, the particulate material is heated to remove the solvent, leaving a dry powder which may then be used as a filler for various applications, production of breeze blocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for encapsulating waste material, in particular an
oleophilic waste material.Examples of waste materials with which the invention is concerned include such
materials present in a sludge. Sludges are generated in various industrial processes. For
example, the cleaning of metal parts to remove grease may involve soaking the part in an
organic solvent with the result that the grease removed (i.e. the waste material) forms a
sludge with the organic solvent,. Sludges may also be produced, for example, from dye,
ink, and paint industries in which paint, ink or dye is dissolved in an organic solvent. The
organic solvents may be chlorinated solvents, e.g. trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene etc.,
or aromatic solvents, e.g. toluene. The sludges generally have no value.Examples of other waste materials with which the invention is concerned include
oil, tar or the like provided for example in the form of oil (or tar) contaminated sand.Problems can be encountered in the disposal of the above types of waste material
to ensure that they do not adversely affect the environment.It is an object of the present invention to obviate or mitigate the above mentioned
problems.JP-A-63/067595 discloses the treatment of waste organic phosphates by mixing the
phosphates including an organic solvent with a solidifying agent such as an alkaline earth
metal hydroxide and heating to form solids and calcining.FR-A-2591513 discloses a solidification process for waste tributyl phosphate, in
which the phosphate is diluted using a hydrocarbon such as dodecane.According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for
encapsulating oleophilic waste material, comprising providing the waste material in
association with a vaporisable organic liquid, admixing the waste material/liquid
composition with fly ash and heating the admixture to remove the liquid.The use in the invention of fly ash (available as a waste-product from coal-burning
power stations) solves the problems both of putting this waste product to economic use and
of avoiding the use of alkaline earth metal hydroxide. Preferably, the fly ash has a particle size of 10-40 microns. An example of a fly ash
is so called mechanical fly ash.Ideally, the waste material is substantially completely dissolved in the vaporisable
liquid which may, for example, be an aliphatic or aromatic solvent. The solvent may be a
chlorinated solvent. e.g. a perchlorinated solvent. Examples of solvents include
trichloroethylene,
