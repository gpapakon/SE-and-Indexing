plurality of electrical device comprises a common wire 

electrically connected to the power source, and a junction 
connector for connecting the common wire to the electrical 

devices at predetermined position of the common wire. The 
junction connector (21) includes a branch terminal (22) having a 

fitting terminal portion (22b1) at one end, and a pressing terminal 
(22a) portion on the other end. The pressing terminal portion (22a) has

junction connector further includes a casing having a wire 

supporting cylinder (21a) into which the common wire is inserted, 
and a terminal supporting hole (21c) into which the branch terminal (22) 

is inserted beginning with the pressing terminal portion (22a).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to junction connectors and bulb sockets for mutual connection, a
wiring system, and methods of manufacturing a wiring system. More particularly, this
invention relates to a junction connector which may be suitably employed for a sub
wiring harness or the like in a vehicle, and to a wire harness and a manufacturing
method of the wire harness which is suitable for manufacture of sub harnesses for
vehicle lamps.For instance, in the case of rear combination lamps on a vehicle, a sub harness is
employed to connect them to the power source. The sub harness has electrical wires
which are to be connected to the positive terminals of the lamps. And the sub harness
also has electrical wires branched from one common electrical wire which are to be
connected to the negative terminals. The electrical wires are branched from the common
electrical wire as follows: First the insulator is removed from the middle of one
electrical wire to expose the core wire, and similarly the insulator is removed from the
end portion of another electrical wire to expose the core wire. Those exposed core wires
are wrapped together with a metal piece, and crimped, and covered with an insulating
tape.And, in manufacturing a wire harness by connecting engaging terminals to the common
electrical wire, the following two methods are employed: In one of the methods,
branching points are determined by marking the electrical wire, and branching wires are
connected to the electrical wire at the branching points thus marked, and engaging
terminals are connected to the branching wires thus connected. In the other method, 
branch terminals are directly connected to the electrical wire being pushed against it at
the branching points.The above-described wire connection takes time and labor including the step of
removing the insulator from the electrical wires; that is, the connection is low in work
efficiency.However, in FR-A-2626124 is a connecting device for a telephone control member
disclosed in which a contact fork provides an electric connection to a wire by pressing
the contact fork to the wire in a right angle within a casing. The connecting device
comprises the contact fork having a cut which is opened in the direction of the axis
thereof and the casing including a wire supporting cylinder into which an insulated wire
is inserted. The casing further includes a terminal supporting hole into which the contact
fork is inserted and which communicates with the wire supporting cylinder in a right
angle. This connecting device
