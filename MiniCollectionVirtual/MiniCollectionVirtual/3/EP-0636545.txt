<ABSTRACT>
The palletised container (1) used as a reusable container for transporting and storing liquids of different types has, as its main components, an outer casing (2) of intersecting vertical and horizontal grid bars (3, 4) made of metal, a supporting insert (5) which can be inserted in the outer casing and consists of smooth wall parts made of plastic for an exchangeable, thin-walled inner container (6) made of plastic with a rectangular contour and rounded corners, which container is fitted with a filling nozzle (7) which can be closed by a screw cap (8) and an emptying nozzle (9) for connection of a removal tap (10), a closure cap (11) made of plastic or sheet metal which is fitted onto the grid casing (2) and the supporting insert (5), and a steel pallet (12) which can be handled by means of a fork-lift truck, storage shelf operating device or the like with length and width dimensions corresponding to eurostandards for bearing the inner container (6), the supporting insert (5) and the grid casing (2). The steel pallet (12) contains a storage space for the grid casing (2) and the supporting insert (5) in a collapsed state for the purpose of transportation and storage when empty.

<CLAIMS>
Pallet container (1) for use as a single- and multi-way
container, with a base trough (19) of sheet metal or plastic

having a base (20) in the form of a discharge base and secured to
a pallet frame (18) of metal, plastics or timber which can be

handled by a fork-lift truck, a shelf-servicing apparatus or the
like, and with a collapsible outer covering (2) detachably

securable to the pallet (12) comprising a metal lattice of sheet
metal and a support insert (5) abutting on the outer covering (2)

comprising wall portions (21-24) collapsible into a package, the
pallet container (1) being optionally usable for transport or

storage of liquids, with a thin-walled plastic inner container
(6) abutting on the support insert (5), and which has a discharge

base (17) and is accommodated in a positive-locking fashion by
the base trough (19) of the pallet (12) or which may be used for

transport and storage of bulk materials, with an inner bag of
plastic film or textile fabric, and which may be used after

extraction of the inner container (6) with the support insert (5)
for conveying and storage of bulk material, characterised in that

there is secured to the outer edge (34) of the flat base trough
(19) of the pallet (12) a mounting frame (35) of sheet metal or

plastic, which contains a stowage space (36) for the outer
covering (2) and the support insert (5) in the collapsed

condition (2', 5') for empty transport and storage of the pallet
container (1).
Pallet container according to claim 1, characterized by a
lid (11) of plastic or sheet metal for closing the transport and

storage space in the operative condition of the container (1) and
formed by the outer lattice (2) and the support insert (5), and

for closing the stowage space (36) of the pallet (12) in the
collapsed condition of the container (1). 
Pallet container according to claim 2, characterised by a
surrounding groove (42) integrally formed in the upper side of

the closure lid (11), for receiving the pallet frame (18) of a
stacked, collapsed container unit.
Pallet container according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the smooth wall portions (21-24) of the

support insert (5), made from plastic, are connected together by
flexible hinge strips (25), which adapt to the rounded corner

regions (26) of the thin-walled plastic inner container (6), and
the forward (21) and the rear wall portion (22) are in addition

foldable in the middle.
Pallet container according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the four lattice walls (27-30) of the outer

covering (2) are connected together by rounded corner plates (31)
with hinges (32) attached thereon, the shape of the corner plates

(31) being adapted to the rounded shape of the corner regions
(26) of the plastic inner container (6) and the hinge strips (25)

of the support insert (5) abutting thereon.
Pallet container according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the forward and the rear lattice wall (27,

28) of the outer covering (2) are divided in the middle and the
respective wall halves (27a, 27b; 28a, 28b) are connected

together by hinges (37), one side wall (29) of the outer covering
(2) being pivotally secured by means of displaceable hinges (38)

on a long section of the upper edge (39) of the mounting frame
(35) of the base trough (19) of the pallet (12), and the other

side wall (30) or both side walls (29, 30) and the wall halves
(27a, 27b; 28a, 28b) of the forward and of the rear lattice wall

(27, 28) of the outer covering (2) are attached by means of
releasable claws (40) to the two long and two short sections of

the upper edge (39) of the mounting frame (35). 
Pallet container according to claim 6, characterised by
releasable locking means (41) for the forward (27) and rear wall

(28) of the lattice covering (2) on the upper edge (39) of the
mounting frame (35).
Pallet container according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterised by an insert trough of plastic for transporting

bulk material.
Pallet container according to one of claims 1 to 8,
characterised by a plate (45) or a flap for closing the access

opening (43) provided for the discharge cock (10) of the plastic
inner container (6) in the mounting frame (35) of the pallet

(12) , and of the forwardly open central foot (44) of the pallet
frame (18) in the discharge area beneath the discharge cock (10)
