<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a homogeneous, aqueous, cleaning composition which comprises surfactant and solvent, and is characterized in that it forms a solvent-water emulsion on evaporation of at least a portion of the solvent. In such systems the solvent system is selected such that it comprises: a first solvent component in an amount such that it is present at a level above the miscibility limit of that component with water, and, a second solvent component which is sufficiently volatile that, in use, it evaporates from the composition to leave a mixture of the first solvent component and water, said second solvent component being present at a level such that first solvent component is solubilised in the composition. By using the second solvent to assist in the solution of the first solvent it is possible to obtain compositions which are clear, stable, isotropic compositions. In use, the second, volatile solvent component evaporates from the overall composition and the remaining first solvent component and water phase-separate, thus forming an emulsion, whereby the cleaning action of the first solvent component is potentiated. The emulsion formed generally has a coarse dispersed phase. This yields the advantages of a stable non-emulsion product as regards storage, dosing and manufacture, employs a relatively low level of solvent and provides the cleaning benefits of a free-solvent system.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improvements relating to 
cleaning compositions and in particular to improvements 
relating to cleaning compositions comprising surfactants and 
solvents. Many cleaning compositions for use in cleaning of household 
and industrial hard surfaces comprise solvent components, in 
addition to surfactants. These solvents are generally 
intended to improve cleaning performance by assisting in the 
removal of greasy or waxy soils. The advantages associated 
with the presence of solvents in such compositions are 
particularly marked at low surfactant levels, such as are 
found in compositions for use on highly reflective surfaces 
upon which high levels of surfactant residues cannot be 
tolerated. Many of these solvent components are immiscible with water or 
have a relatively low level of miscibility above which they 
form emulsions and therefore those compositions which 
comprise levels of solvent above the miscibility limit either 
need to be shaken vigorously prior to use or the solvent 
needs to be present as a stable emulsion. One such emulsion is disclosed in US-A-4689168 (The Drackett 
Company) which discloses anisotropic hard surface cleaning 
compositions containing volatile silicones, a non-volatile 
surfactant preferably selected from amongst anionic, nonionic 
surfactants and mixtures thereof and a polar organic solvent 
having a boiling point in the range 75-250°C which is 
preferably ethyl, propyl or butyl alcohol and water.  
 On shaking these compositions form semi-stable emulsions 
which break on contact with a hard surface to release the 
components. Stable emulsions can be difficult to prepare and are prone to 
phase-separation. As consumers prefer stable, single phase 
systems and single phase systems are more readily formulated, 
processed, stored and dispensed than emulsions, the use of 
immiscible solvents in single phase compositions has been 
limited to relatively low levels. Compositions comprising a binary solvent system of terpenes 
and polar solvents are described in EP-A-0040882 and 
EP-A-0080749. Typical compositions for cleaning glass are described in 
EP-A-261874 (The Procter and Gamble Company: 1986/87). In 
that document are described cleaning compositions which 
comprise a specific isomer of n-butoxy propan-2-ol, available 
commercially as 'DOWANOL PnB' (RTM, from the DOW Chemical 
Company). n-butoxy propan-2-ol is miscible with water up to 
a level of around 6% dependent on temperature and levels of 
isomers. In that specification it is
