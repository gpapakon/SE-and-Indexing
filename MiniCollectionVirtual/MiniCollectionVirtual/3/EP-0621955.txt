<ABSTRACT>
A control system for a gradient field generator, suitable for example for an NMR apparatus, includes filters which modify the field demand signal. The modification shapes the gradient field profile typically to compensate for the response characteristics of the NMR apparatus. Current generators (3a, 3b) supply currents to a plurality of individually magnetisable windings. The filters include different filters (F0, F1) corresponding to matrix currents (I0, I1) of different orders. The outputs of the different filters are summed to provide a control input for one of the current generators, and subtracted to provide the control input for the other of the current generators. The system thereby provides substantially decoupled control of the different field orders.

<DESCRIPTION>
 GRADIENT FIELD CONTROLTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a method and apparatus for controlling the gradient field in an NMR apparatus. It is applicable to any type of NMR apparatus including superconducting, resistive electromagnetic or permanent magnetic systems.BACKGROUNDIn typical NMR imaging and spectroscopy apparatus a main magnet is provided for generating a homogeneous steady axial field. In addition, a number of gradient coil sets are also provided. These superimpose gradients on the main field in order to localise a working volume of uniform magnetisation within the apparatus for investigation of the sample at that position.In use, a pulse is applied to the gradient coils and the subsequent free induction decay (FID) signal from the sample is sensed. While ideally the output of the coil would vary as a step function, in practice imperfections in the dynamic response of the gradient coils means that the shape of the output field pulse tends to be degraded. In particular, it may be found that a large z0 term, equivalent to a time-varying shift in the main magnetic field B0, is generated as a result of eddy currents in the apparatus. These fields occur, for example, in the metal components making up the coil housing or NMR apparatus.It has previously been proposed to use compensation techniques of the type known in control engineering as "feedforward" in order to compensate for these imperfections in the dynamic response of the gradient field coils. This is widely known as pre-emphasis where the flux lags the current and emphasis is needed on the current to give a flat flux response. At their simplest, these techniques might involve the insertion of a multi- exponential signal shaping network in the feed to the 

 existing gradient coil. Typically between two and five time constants are set based on a mixture of measurement and empirical methods.US-A-4585995 in the name of Flugan, for example, discloses a system in which an overshoot current is provided to a gradient coil during gradient switching. The shape of the pre-emphasis signal is determined by a time constant network.With simple pre-emphasis techniques of the type described above, it is not possible fully to compensate for the imperfections in the response of the gradient coil. This results, in part, from the cross-coupling of the different spatial orders of the field in the gradient coils. This means, in a z gradient for example, changes in the z field will also alter the z0, X, Y fields and even higher field orders.In an
