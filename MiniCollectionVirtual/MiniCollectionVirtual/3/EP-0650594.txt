<ABSTRACT>
The increased use of reusable bottles is linked with effective purification prior to refilling. Unfortunately, a considerable number of reusable containers are sent back with urine and hydrocarbon contamination (solvents/fuels). Detection of hydrocarbons is done using photoionization detectors or mass spectrometers, which permit a reliable selection. These measuring techniques are not applicable to urine, or only so with serious limitations. The method described here ensures that containers with residual urine can be reliably identified and sorted out. Depending on the age of the urine, ammonia (NH3) is released into the atmosphere, with detected quantities ranging from 3 to about 35 ppm in fresh or 14-day-old reference samples. The method used to measure these is based on the recognition of NH3, with the ammonia being burned catalytically or in a high-temperature converter to produce NO (nitrogen monoxide), which is then reacted with ozone. The energy released in this consequent reaction takes the form of light (chemiluminescence). This light is measured and provides a mesure of the ammonia present. The field of applications is that of monitoring sanitation with respect to reusable bottles and containers in the food and drink industries.

Method for determining the amount of residual urine in reusable bottles and 
containers wherein the ammonia released from the urine is burned in a connverter 

to produce nitrogen monoxide, which is then reacted with ozone in a chemiluminescent 
reaction which then provides a measure of the ammonia present. 
Method according to claim 1 wherein the air is exhausted from the containers 
and the ammonia/air mixture is converted into nitrogen monoxide (NO). 
Method according to claim 1, wherein the air mixture exhaused from the containers 
is converted into nitrogen monoxide (NO) in a high-temperature converter. 
Method according to the preceding claims 1 to 3, wherein the nitrogen monoxide 
(NO) is reacted with ozone in a chemiluminescent reaction to produce nitrogen 

dioxide. 
Method according to the preceding claims 1 to 4, wherein the light produced in 
the chemiluminescent process serves the detection of ammonia. 
Method according to claim 2, wherein the catalyst consists of platinum, a platinum-iridium 
compound, a platinum-rhodium compound on a carrier material, 

especially silica- or alumina pellets or gauze. 
Method according to the preceding claims 2 and 3, wherein the energy of an 
infrared radiator is focussed on the converter with a reflector for heating the catalyst. 
Method according to claim 7, wherein the converter may be designed as capillary 
tube.  

 
Method according to the preceding claims 1 to 8, wherein the capillary tube has 
the double function of a converter and flowmeter and - due to its small volume - 

restricts the rinsing time of the analyzer and, by this, the testing time to 140 - 
200 msec. 
Method according to the preceding claims 6 to 9, wherein the capillary tube 
consists of a material as described under claim 6. 
Method according to the preceding claims 1 to 10, wherein a gas phase titration 
with ozone can be interposed for the control of the original stability.
