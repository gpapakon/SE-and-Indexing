<ABSTRACT>
An aircraft (10, 10' or 50) capable of sustained flight including a fuselage 
(12 or 52) and a spiral-formed flat-section right hand and left hand wing (14 and 

16) positioned in generally horizontally opposing relation along either side of the 
fuselage. Each wing is formed of an elongated flat panel or plate having 

generally parallel leading (14c and 16c) and trailing edges (14d and 16d), the 
length of the panel being substantially greater than its width, the width being 

substantially greater than its thickness. The forward (1 4a and 1 6a) and rearward 
(14b and 16b) ends of each wing are movably connected within forward and 

rearward longitudinal channels of the fuselage. By appropriate controlled linear 
and rotational movement of the wing ends, in combination with a conventional 

rudder (20) of an upright rear stabilizer fin (18) of the fuselage, all aerodynamic 
flight path variable control is accomplished. Both single (14 and 16) and 

multiple (54 and 56) spiral-turned wings are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to aircraft having a unique wing configuration, 
and more particularly to an aircraft for sustained flight which includes a pair 
of spiral wound wings which extend along either side of the fuselage. In additional to conventional Bernoulli-effect type or planar-type wings for 
aircraft wherein lift is achieved by creating a lower pressure on the upper 
surface of the conventional wing, a number of uniquely configured lifting 
members for aircraft are disclosed in prior art. A uniquely configured wing arrangement known as a "ring airfoil" is well 
known. The ring airfoil is constructed as a body substantially presenting 
rotational symmetry, i.e. being substantially cylindrical. One such devices is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,017,139 invented by Binder. Another ring or "annular" 
winged airplane is disclosed in a model form invented by Howell in U.S. Patent 
3,903,639. In this invention, two separate annular wings, one at each end of the 
fuselage, are disclosed. Bruning, in U.S. Patent 3,653,609 teaches a lifting body for an aircraft in 
the form of an inverted horizontally oriented semi-cylinder connected over a 
fuselage. A flying toy, including an annular or tubular aerodynamic member, is 
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,248,007 invented by Gamburd. A self-propelled 
lighter than air airship is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,967,983 to Motts having an 
annular or toroidal airfoil fuselage which houses elongated gas cells for lift. A number of other uniquely configured, but less related wing structures for 
aircraft are disclosed in the following U.S. Patents:

includes a pair of side-by-side spiral wound wings each of which are formed of 
an elongated semi-flexible flat panel or plate which provide both necessary flight-sustaining 
lift and maneuverability. Maneuverability is achieved by the unique 
linear and rotational movement of each end of each wing structure, in  
 
combination with a conventional rudder arrangement. By this invention, extreme 
simplicity, compactness for storing small aircraft in relatively small enclosures 
without disassembly and which will maneuverably fly at safe low levels, landing 
in relatively short runways. This invention is directed to an aircraft capable of sustained flight including 
a fuselage and a spiral-formed flat-section right hand
