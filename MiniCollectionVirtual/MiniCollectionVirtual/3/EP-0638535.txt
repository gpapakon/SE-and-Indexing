<ABSTRACT>
Process for preparing pentafluoroethane (HFC-125) wherein 
1,1,1-trifluorodichloroethane (HFC-123) is reacted with HF 

at a temperature from 310° to 380°C, in the presence of a 
catalyst comprising Cr₂O₃ supported on preformed AlF₃. HFC-125 

is obtained with high yields (up to 60-70% and over), 
high conversions (over 80%) and high selectivity, i.e. 

formation of by-product in very low amounts (5% by moles at 
most) Moreover, the catalyst maintains a high activity for 

a long time also with high organic charges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
preparing pentafluoroethane (HFC-125). More particularly,
the present invention relates to a process for preparing
HFC-125 by catalytic fluorination with HF of 1,1,1-trifluorodichloroethane
(HCFC-123).It is known that HFC-125, since it does not contain
chlorine, has no destructive potential towards the
atmospheric ozone and therefore it is an excellent
substitute of the conventional chlorofluorocarbons (CFC),
which, as known, will be subjected within a few years to
severe restrictions both for the production and for the use,
according to what provided for by the Montreal Protocol. It
is therefore evident the utility of disposing of a process
for the manufacture of HFC-125 on industrial scale.Fluorination processes of tetrachloroethylene with HF
in the presence of a catalyst based on an oxide of a
transition metal, such as chromium, nickel, cobalt,
manganese, etc. (see for isntance US Patents 3,258,500,
3,755,477 and 4,766,260), are known in the art. Such
processes lead to the achievement of mixtures of more or 
less fluorinated saturated products, among which 1,1,1-trifluorodichloroethane (HCFC-123),
1,1,1,2-tetrafluorochloroethane
(HCFC-124) and HFC-125. An inconvenience
common to such processes is the poor selectivity obtainable
in the reactions conditions necessary for producing HFC-125
with satisfactory yields: as a matter of fact, remarkable
unrecoverable fractions of disproportionation by-products
form, such as CFC-113 (CCl2F-CClF2 and CFC-114 (CClF2-CClF2).
There is also the formation of chloroolefinic by-products,
in particular CFC-1112 (CFCl=CFCl) and CFC-1112a (CF2=CCl2),
which, as known, cause problems of toxicity and chemical
stability, whereby they must be successively removed. If
one tries to optimize the conditions (for instance by
falling the reaction temperature) so as to increase the
selectivity, the production of HFC-125 decreases
unacceptably for an application on industrial scale.
Moreover, such processes have the great inceonvenience of a
quick decay of the catalytic activity after 70-90 hours of
maximum reaction, activity which, even after regeneration of
the catalyst, according to known techniques, cannot be
restored to the initial values. They are therefore
unsuitable processes for continuous productions on
industrial scale.The same problems of decay of the catalytic activity 
were found by the Applicant for the process described in the
patent application EP 349,298, wherein HCFC-123 and/or HCFC-124
are prepared by fluorination of
