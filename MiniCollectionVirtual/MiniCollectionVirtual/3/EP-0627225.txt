<CLAIMS>
Superabsorbents which can be obtained by reacting
powdered chitosan suspended in an organic acid,

with the exception of carboxylic acids having a substantial
hydrophobic portion, and removing the powdery

reaction product from the suspension.
Superabsorbents, characterized in that chitosan
is reacted with a hydroxycarboxylic acid.
The superabsorbents according to claim 2, characterized
in that the hydroxycarboxylic acid is lactic

acid, hydroxybutyric acid and/or glycolic acid.
The superabsorbents according to any of claims
1 to 3, characterized in that the amount of acid is

from 1 to 30 mmol/g chitosan.
The superabsorbents according to any of claims
2 to 4, characterized in tha
t the chitosan reacted with
a hydroxycarboxylic acid is crosslinked with a cross-linking

agent.
The superabsorbents according to claim 5, characterized
in that the crosslinking agents are dicarboxylic

acids, dianhydrides, dicarboxylic acid chlorides,
diepoxides, or dialdehydes.
The superabsorbents according to any of claims
5 or 6, characterized in that the amount of crosslinking

agent is from 0.0001 to 10 mmol/g chitosan.
A process for producing superabsorbents, characterized
in that 


powdered chitosan is suspended in a mixture of an
organic solvent and an organic acid,
the suspended chitosan reacts with the organic
acid, and
the powdery reaction product is removed from the
suspension.
The process according to claim 8, characterized
in that the weight ratio of solvent to chitosan is from

1:1 to 100:1, preferably from 5:1 to 20:1.
The process according to claim 9, characterized
in that the amount of acid is from 1 to 30, preferably

from 2 to 10 mmol/g chitosan.
The process according to any of claims 8 to 10,
characterized in that powdered chitosan in an organic

solvent is reacted with an organic acid, and crosslinking
with a crosslinking agent is effected simultaneously

or subsequently.
The process according to claim 11, characterized
in that the organic acid is a hydroxycarboxylic

acid, preferably lactic acid, hydroxybutyric acid
and/or glycolic acid.
The process according to claim 11 or 12, characterized
in that the amount of crosslinking agent is

from 0.001 to 10 mmol/g chitosan.
Use of the superabsorbents according to claims
1 to 7 in hygiene articles.
