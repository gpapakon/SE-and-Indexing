<ABSTRACT>
The magnetic field assembly of a magnetic resonance imaging device includes an 
annular superconducting magnet (10) which is mounted within a toroidal vacuum vessel (24). 

A cylindrical member (26) defines a central bore through which the superconducting magnets 
generate a temporally constant primary magnetic field. A cylindrical, dielectric former (46) 

is mounted in the bore displaced a small distance from the cylindrical member. A radio 
frequency coil (32) is mounted within the cylindrical member defining a patient receiving 

examination region. An RF shield (34) is mounted around and exterior peripheral surface of 
the former. Primary gradient coils (40) are mounted around and potted to the exterior of the 

dielectric former around the RF shield. Gradient shield or secondary coils (44) are potted 

around an exterior of the cylindrical member within the vacuum chamber. As illustrated in 
FIGURE 3, when unshielded gradient coils are used, the primary gradient coils and the RF 

shield are mounted around the outer diameter of the cylindrical member (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetic resonance gradient coil and RF screen. It finds
particular application in conjunction with self-shielded gradient and RF coil assemblies for
magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and will be described with particular reference thereto.
However, it will be appreciated that the present invention will also find application in
conjunction with magnetic resonance spectroscopy systems and other applications which
require RF fields and gradient magnetic fields.Heretofore, magnetic resonance imagers have utilized a cylindrical superconducting
magnet assembly which generates a temporally constant primary magnetic field axially
through a room temperature bore or central cylinder of the magnet assembly. The magnet
windings are maintained at liquid helium temperatures in a cryostat. This structure is double
walled to provide a vacuum space, intermediate cold shields, and room for superinsulation.
Cryostat construction is optimized to minimize helium boil-off. The room temperature bore
of the magnet provides space for gradient magnetic field coils, RF coils, and, of course, the
object or person to be imaged. The gradient coils generate axial fields which have gradients in three mutually
orthogonal directions, x, y, and the axial direction z. Current waveforms are applied to the
gradients during the MR process. The gradients in turn induce eddy currents in the metal
structures of the magnet cryostat. The magnetic fields of the eddy currents then become part
of the magnetic fields seen by the object being imaged. To the extent that the eddy currents
mimic the gradient that caused them, they could be corrected by pre-emphasis. In general,
it helps to maintain some spacing between the gradient and magnet structures that might
sustain eddy currents. More recently, self shielded gradients have been developed that
eliminate the eddy currents in the magnet structure (GB-A-2 259 773, WO 91/19209).Self shielded gradients consist of a primary set of coils on a cylindrical former and
a shield set of coils on a second former at a larger radius. At radii outside the shielded
gradient, the magnetic fields produced by the primary coils are substantially cancelled by
those of the shielding coils. The gradient fields of both sets of coils combine to produce axial
directed fields with substantially first order intensity gradients in the x, y, and z-directions.
It is desirable that the primary and shield coils have a radius ratio of 1.3 or more so the shield
coil does not cancel too much of the field
