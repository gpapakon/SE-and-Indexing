<ABSTRACT>
Information cursors are provided for use in an 
operating system and/or application programs. Each 

information cursor includes a pointing portion to point to 
objects displayed on a video display and an information 

portion to display information about an object to which the 
pointing portion points. The information displayed in an 

information cursor may include the name of the object, a 
preview of the contents of the object, or property information 

about the object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to data 
processing systems and, more particularly, to information 
cursors for use on video displays of data processing 
systems. Many operating systems provide a cursor that 
indicates a current position on a video display. The 
cursor is generally manipulable by an input device, such 
as a keyboard or a mouse. In certain operating systems, 
such as the Microsoft WINDOWS, version 3.1, operating 
system, which is sold by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, 
Washington, a window may have a status bar that displays 
information about the object to which the cursor is 
currently pointing. As the cursor is moved to point at 
different objects, the contents of the status bar changes 
accordingly. The status bar is a separate graphic entity 
that is not connected to the cursor and does not move with 
the cursor. The status bar is positioned on the video 
display at a fixed location within a window. As such, a 
user has to look at two separate portions of the screen if 
he wishes to view both the cursor and the status bar. 
This separation of the status bar from the cursor can be 
confusing and burdensome to the user. In accordance with a first aspect of the present 
invention, a method is practiced in a data processing 
system having a video display and an input device. In 
this method, objects, including an information cursor, are 
displayed on a video display. The cursor is positioned 
over at least a portion of one of the objects that is  
 
displayed in response to a user using the input device. 
Information about the object which at least a portion of 
the cursor is over is displayed on the video display. The information that is displayed as part of the 
cursor may include a name of the object, a preview of the 
contents of the object, or property information about the 
object. The property information may include help 
information regarding the object. Furthermore, the input 
device may be a mouse that is used to position the cursor. The information cursor may be displayed as 
having a pointing portion for pointing to objects on the 
video display and an information portion for displaying 
information about the object. The information cursor may 
be specified as "On" or "Off". When the information 
cursor is specified as "On", information about the object 
is displayed as part of the cursor. However, when the 
information cursor is specified as "Off", such information 
is not displayed as part of the cursor. In accordance with another aspect of the present 
inventio

<CLAIMS>
In a data processing system having a video 
display and an input device, a method, comprising the steps 

of: 

(a) displaying objects on the video display, said 
objects including an information cursor; 
(b) in response to a user using the input device, 
positioning the cursor over at least a portion of one of the 

objects that is displayed; and 
(c) displaying information on the video display 
about the object that at least a portion of the cursor is 

over. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the 
step of displaying information on the video display further 

comprises the step of displaying a name of the object that at 
least a portion of the cursor is over. 
The method as recited in claim 2 wherein the 
step of displaying information on the video display further 

comprises the step of displaying a preview of contents of the 
object that at least a portion of the cursor is over. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the 
step of displaying information on the video display further 

comprises the step of displaying a preview of contents of the 
object that at least a portion of the cursor is over. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the 
step of displaying information on the video display further 

comprises the step of displaying property information about 
the object that at least a portion of the cursor is over. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the 
step of displaying property information further comprises the 

step of display help information regarding the object. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the 
input device is a mouse and the step of positioning the cursor 

further comprises the steps of tracking movements of the mouse 
by the user and updating position of the cursor on the video 

display. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the 
step of displaying objects on the video display further 

comprises the step of displaying a cursor on the video display 
having a pointing portion for pointing to an object on the 

video display and an information portion for displaying 
information about the object to which the pointing portion 

points. 
The method as recited in claim 1, further 
comprising the step of determining what information is 

associated with the object that at least a portion of the 
cursor is over. 
The method as recited in claim 1 wherein the 
step of displaying information on the video display further 

comprises the steps of: 

(i) determining whether the information cursor 
is specified as "On"; and 
(ii) in response to determining whether the 
information cursor is specified as "On", displaying 

information on the video display about the object that at 
least a portion of the cursor is over when the 

information cursor is specified as "On". 
In a data processing system having a mouse, 
having at least one button, and a video display, a method 

comprising the steps of: 

(a) displaying a cursor, a source-object icon for a 
source object and a destination-object icon for a destination 

object on the video display; 
(b) in response to movements of the mouse by a 
user, moving the cursor to point to the source-object icon; 
(c) displaying on the video display a name of the 
source object as part of the cursor; 
(d) in response to the user depressing the button 
of the mouse while the cursor points to the source object icon 

and moving the mouse while keeping the button depressed, 
dragging the source-object icon over the video display to 

where the destination-object icon is positioned so that the 

cursor points to the destination-object icon; and 
(e) displaying a name of the destination object 
along with the name of the source object as part of the 

cursor.

(b) displaying information about the object 
associated with the icon to which the pointing portion of the 

information cursor points as part of the information cursor.
