<ABSTRACT>
A lighting system and method with variable light intensity for use in motion picture photography. In the lighting apparatus, light emitted from a source (18) is passed through an aperture (36a) and then through a section of a movable, neutral density filter (50). The preferred filter (50) is specifically designed to have a variable density, continuously increasing from one side of the filter to the other. By changing the position of the filter (50), selectively placing higher or lower density sections in the light path, the intensity of the light emitted by the lighting apparatus may be varied. The neutral density filter (50) is selected to be generally color neutral so that the color quality of the light passing therethrough remains unchanged.

<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the present invention relates to
lighting apparatus such as may be particularly used for
varying the intensity of light produced by a light source
for use in motion picture photography such as film and
video.In a motion picture production, it is often
advantageous to vary the amount of light on a subject.
One such occurrence is when a subject is moved
progressively closer to the camera and light source during
filming. When employing an artificial light source, the
intensity may be varied by changing the power input to the
light such as through a rheostat. However as the
intensity is varied, the color quality or color
temperature is also varied. Though such color change may
not be perceptible to the human eye, color film is easily
affected by color quality change.U.S. Patent No. 4,015,113 discloses a variable
intensity light source in which light from a lighting
element is directed against a reflector. The reflector
has adjustable degrees cf reflectivity being comprised of
a plurality of rotatable cylindrical rollers, each roller
having half of its surface coated with a black,
nonreflective material. As the rollers are rotated, the
intensity of light is varied without changing color
quality. Other devices have included shutter elements
interposed in the light path, the elements opening or
closing to vary the amount of light transmitted or
reflected. US-A-4 984 143 discloses a light filtering
system for use with a spot light. The filtering system
consists of a filter module which includes three colour-specific
filter elements and a colour neutral filter
element. The filter elements can be formed by discs
arranged so that a portion of their area interrupts the
light beam. The filtering can vary circumferentially
around the discs so that they have a clear section, and a
section of gradually increasing density. Thus, rotation
of the discs adjusts the degree of filtering. The discs
are rotated by motors under the control of a computer.US-A-4 890 208 discloses stage lighting
apparatus which, again, includes a filter unit with three
colour-specific filter elements and one colour neutral
filter element. The elements may be strips or discs which
overlap and have a density which varies over their area so
that the degree of filtering can be adjusted by moving the
filter elements. The elements may be motor driven.The present inventors have recognised that some
of these existing designs may have limitations including
size, weight, efficiency, colour control, and/or
versatility and alternate designs would
