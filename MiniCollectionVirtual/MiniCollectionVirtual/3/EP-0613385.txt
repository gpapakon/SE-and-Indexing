<ABSTRACT>
An oral inhaler device having a box member (2) containing a volatile material for inhalation and having inhalation opening(s) (4), at least partly contained within a substantially conforming casing (5A, 5B) which can be slid relative to the box member so as to cover and uncover the inhalation opening(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel device, being an oral inhaler by means of 
which a volatile material may be inhaled. Oral inhalers of this general type are known, for example as used by asthma 
sufferers etc. for the inhalation of a medicament as a vapour or as a stream of air-carried 
particles or droplets. It is desirable that such inhalers are convenient enough to 
be easily carried, for example in a pocket or handbag etc., for use when needed, that 
they should be cheap and robust, and that they should be capable of being closed so as 
to restrict ingress of contamination, or evaporation of volatile contents. One known 
type of inhaler is that described in ES-1007117-U (Calmante Vitaminado S.A.). US-A-2318636 forming the preamble of claim 1 discloses an oral inhaler in 
which inhalation openings in a front wall of the inhaler body are closed by a hinged 
cover which is operated by a casing which slides parallel to a side wall of the body. The present invention provides an oral inhaler which to some extent at least 
provides these desirable features in a particularly convenient form of device. Accordingly this invention provides an oral inhaler comprising the subject 
matter of claim 1. The side walls are suitably parallel and planar, and are suitably rectangular in 
shape. The term "rectangular" used herein includes "square", and also includes shapes 
which are generally rectangular but have rounded or chamfered corners, but which do 
not detract from the generally rectangular shape, for example lozenge shapes. The box member is preferably tetragonal in general shape, although its walls 
may meet its edges with sharp corners, rounded corners or chamfered corners which 
themselves may meet the walls and edges with curves. In such a tetragonal box member 
the front edge, and the opposing edge may for example be profiled though without 
detracting from the overall generally tetragonal shape,. For example these edges may 
be curved, so that a cross section through the walls and these edges may be lozenge-shaped. Suitably the edge distance is substantially less than the length and width 
dimensions of the side walls. Suitably the edge distance may be 0.25 or less, e.g. 0.2 
or less, e.g. 0.1 or less of the length dimension of the box member. Suitable ratios of 
side wall length: side wall width: edge distance of the box member are 6-10 : 6-10 : 1. 
A suitable edge dimension for the box member is around 5 +/- 2 mm. The front edge may be completely open, or it may comprise an edge wall 
having one or

<CLAIMS>
An oral inhaler comprising; a box member (1) having two side walls (2) 
separated by an edge distance less than the length and width dimensions of each side 

wall (2), and having an edge wall (3) as a front edge which has at least one inhalation 
opening (4) therein for inhalation therethrough, said box member (1) containing or 

capable of containing a volatile material (8) for inhalation, the box member (1) having 
at least one additional opening (6) for the ingress of air; said box member (1) being at 

least partly contained within a substantially conforming casing (5A,5B,5C) comprised 
of one or more casing elements (5A) (5B) (5C) which are slideably mounted upon the 

box member (1); 
characterised
 in that the said casing element(s) (5A), (5B), (5C) is/are 
capable of being slid relative to said box member (1) in a direction parallel to the front 

edge (3) of the box member (1) between a first position in which said opening(s) (4) in 
the front edge (3) of the box member (1) is/are covered by (a) slideable casing 

element(s) (5A), (5B), (5C) and into a second position in which the opening(s) (4) 
is/are uncovered by the slideable casing element(s) (5A), (5B), (5C). 
An oral inhaler according to claim 1 
characterised
 in that the side walls (2) are 
parallel, planar and generally rectangular in shape. 
An oral inhaler according to claim 1 or 2 
characterised
 in that the edge distance 
is 0.25 or less of the length dimension. 
An oral inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised
 in 
that the box member (1) is tetragonal in shape. 
An oral inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised
 in 
that the casing (5A,5B,5C) is tetragonal in shape. 
An oral inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised
 in 
that box member (1) is completely contained within the casing (5A,5B,5C) when the 

casing element(s) (5A,5B,5C) is/are slid into its/their first position, and partly 
contained when the casing element(s) (5A,5B,5C) is/are slid into its/their second 

position. 
An oral inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims 
characterised
 in 
that the casing (5C) comprises a single casing element (5C) slideably mounted upon the 

box member (1).  
 
An oral inhaler according to any one of claims 1 to 7 
characterised
 in that the 
casing comprises two casing elements (5A, 5B) slideably mounted on the box member 

(1). 
An oral inhaler according to claim 7 or 8 
characterised
 in that the two casing 
elements (5A, 5B) are independently slideable toward opposite ends of the box member 

(1), so that in their second position the opening(s) (4) in the front wall (3) are located 
between the two casing elements (5A,5B). 
An oral inhaler according to any one of the preceding claims, 
characterised
 in 
that the volatile material (8) is a solid, as a pellet or within an air permeable container 

or capsule, or a liquid impregnated on a wicking material or into a solid matrix.
