has a yoke (2) formed by laminating a large number of steel sheets (4), the yoke has an even number of magnetic poles (5) protruding 

outward, and a permanent magnet (3) for a field is inserted into each, or every other, magnetic poles, the permanent magnet 
rotor of the present invention has a structure in which the permanent magnet for the field is inserted into a slot (6) formed in 

the magnetic pole, and protuberances (9) striking the side surfaces of the permanent magnet for the field are disposed at the right 
and left end portions of the slot. Further, in the present invention, in the brushless motor of this kind, engagement pawls (12) engaging 

with the permanent magnet for the field are so disposed as to protrude, reliefs (13) for absorbing a bend of the engagement 
pawl are formed in those of the steel sheets laminated to form the yoke which correspond to the engagement pawl. The steel 

sheets of the yoke are deviated on one or both ends sequentially in the rotating direction. A bridge width at both ends of the slot is 
set to be greater than the greater one of a width capable of being punched out and a width allowed from a mechanical strength 

due to a centrifugal force between the width capable of being punched out, a width allowed from the number of passing magnetic 
fluxes and the width allowed from the mechanical strength due to the centrifugal force. Further, at least one connecting portion of 

gap is provided to each magnetic pole so as to laminate the steel sheets. The bridge width at both end of the slot is set to be smaller 
than a width from the outside portion of the permanent magnet for the field to the outside edge of the magnetic pole.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a permanent magnet rotor of a 
brushless motor, and particularly to a permanent magnet 
rotor of a brushless motor which has a yoke made by laminating 
a large number of steel sheets, an even number of magnetic 
poles protruding outward on the yoke, and a permanent 
magnet for a field inserted in each magnetic pole or every 
other magnetic poles. Generally known brushless motors consist of a permanent 
magnet rotor which has a plurality of permanent magnets for 
a field inserted in a yoke made by laminating steel sheets 
and a stator which has magnetic poles opposing to the outer 
periphery of magnetic poles of the above permanent magnet 
rotor with a small space therebetween. Fig. 35 is a sectional view in a direction intersecting 
at right angles with the rotatable shaft of a brushless 
motor using a conventional permanent magnet rotor. In this  
 
drawing, a conventional brushless motor 51 consists of a 
stator 52 and a permanent magnet rotor 53. The stator 52 
has the permanent magnet rotor 53 rotatably supported therein 
and many stator magnetic poles 54 protruded inward. The 
stator magnetic poles 54 have a coil (not shown) wound 
thereon. Passing a current through the coil excites a prescribed 
magnetic pole of the stator magnetic poles 54. A 
magnetic pole face 55 at the end of the stator magnetic 
poles 54 is positioned above a cylindrical face at an equal 
distance from the center of a rotatable shaft 56 of the 
motor. The permanent magnet rotor 53 consists of a yoke 57 
made by laminating many steel sheets and a pair of permanent 
magnets 58 for a field. The yoke 57 has four magnetic poles 
59 protruded externally on its outer periphery, and the 
permanent magnets 58 for the field are inserted in every 
other bases of the magnetic poles 59 with N poles opposed to 
each other. A magnetic pole face 60 at the end of each magnetic 
pole 59 is formed to have a curved shape at an equal 
distance from the center of the rotatable shaft 56, and opposed 
to the magnetic pole face 55 at an equal distance at 
every point on the face of the rotatable magnetic pole face 
60. In the above permanent magnet rotor 53, the repulsion  
 
of the N poles of the permanent magnets 58 for the field 
causes the magnetic fluxes to get out of the magnetic pole 
faces 60 without the permanent magnet for the field as shown 
in the drawing, to pass through the stator, and to enter the 
yoke 57 from the magnetic pole faces 60 with the permanent 
magnet for the field. Accordingly, the magnetic poles
