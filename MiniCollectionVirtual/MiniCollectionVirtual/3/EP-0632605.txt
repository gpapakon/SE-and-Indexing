<ABSTRACT>
Radiated from each orbiting satellite of a 
satellite communication network to M cells (M 

representing an integer, such as thirty-seven) covered 
with a predetermined solid angle on the earth, M spot 

beams are identified by M identification codes. In an 
earth station which may be a portable unit, a burst 

signal transmitter device (31) comprises a receiver part 
(35) receiving one of the spot beams as a received beam 

at a reception time, to recognize as a recognized code 
one of the identification codes that identifies the 

received beam, and a transmitter part (45) for 
transmitting burst signals at a transmission time delayed 

from the reception time by an offset amount selected by 
the recognized code from M offset amounts predetermined 

for the identification codes. Preferably, the M offset 
amounts are stored in a memory (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a burst signal
transmission in a satellite communication network for
communication, through a plurality of orbiting satellites
orbiting the earth, among a great number of earth
stations which may be fixed stations and/or selectively
called mobile stations. In recent practice, the orbiting
satellite is often called low earth orbit satellite.
More particularly, this invention relates to a burst
signal transmitting method of transmitting a burst signal
from an arbitrary one of the earth stations to one of the
orbiting satellites that is communicatable with the earth
station under consideration, to a burst signal
transmitter device for use in such an earth station, and
to a transponder for use on each orbiting satellite.For use as a communication satellite in a
multiple access communication network, a geostationary
satellite on a geostationary orbit is in general use.
Whereas, a like communication network was proposed in
about 1950 for communication through an orbiting
satellite. For launching such satellites, large scaled
rockets have recently become available to establish arts
for launching small sized satellites accompanying a large
sized satellite. Furthermore, rockets have been
developed for small sized satellites. This has made it
economic to launch small sized satellites. As a
consequence, attention has been drawn to satellite
communication networks through a plurality of small sized
orbiting satellites on orbits of low and/or middle
altitudes. Such satellite communication networks are
superior to a network through a geostationary satellite
because of a shorter propagation delay between earth
stations and of compact transmission and reception
terminals. As a typical example of communication
networks through orbiting satellites, the IRIDIUM system
of Motorola, Inc., U.S.A., is described as a report in
the Japanese language in a periodical "Nikkei
Kommunikeisyon" (Nikkei Communications), No. 112,
published by a publisher named Nikkei BP on the 21st
October 1991, pages 31 to 32. This report is presumably
based on a paper entitled "Application of Motorola
Satellite Communications, Inc., for a Low Earth Orbit
Mobile Satellite System before the Federal Communications
Commission, Washington, D.C., December 1990", of which
eight pages are available to us, including the title page
and two figure pages 1a and 1b. See as well EP-A-0 365 885
(Motorola).In the manner which will later be described in
greater detail, it has been unavoidable to use a long 
guard time in a conventional burst
