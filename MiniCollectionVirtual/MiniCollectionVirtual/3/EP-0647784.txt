<ABSTRACT>
A hydropneumatic filament-wound pressure vessel (10) is 
disclosed. The vessel (10) includes a split tank closure and 

diaphragm assembly comprising a pair of cup-shaped plastic 
tank liners (12,14) having cylindrical sidewall portions terminating 

in circular open mouth portions. A cylindrical ring (38) is 
interposed between the open mouths of the liners (12,14) and is sealed 

to the liners (12,14) by a fusion welding operation. A cup-shaped 
elastomeric diaphragm (66) is sealed to the cylindrical ring (38) and 

separates the interior of the vessel (10) into a pair of pressure 
chambers. The outer surface of the tank is helically wound 

with a resin-impregnated continuous filament.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a filament-wound
hydropneumatic accumulator tank containing a flexible
diaphragm which separates the interior of the tank into a
compressible gas-containing chamber and a liquid-containing
chamber.Accumulator or pressure-controlled devices,
according to this invention, are especially adapted for liquid
dispensing systems and, particularly, for water systems
dependant upon well water, a pump and, because of intermittent
use, an intermittent source of pressurization for the system.
A simple prior art system for accumulating the pressurization
of a well water system, for example, in a dwelling, comprises
a pipe extending into the underground water supply, a pump,
and a reservoir tank. Frequently, the tank is a metal
container having no valve and in which air is merely trapped.
In some installations, a valve, such as a conventional tire
valve, may be positioned at or near the top of the container,
and an outlet may be provided near the bottom. In many cases,
a diaphragm is not provided, but it is highly desirable to
separate the air from the water and the tank since air will
dissolve in the water and may create a "white water" problem
at the taps. A charge of air is introduced in the tank,
usually occupying about one-half of the volume of the tank and
to a pressure sufficient to force water into the plumbing
system connected thereto. A pressure switch senses the
pressure within the tank or in the water line, as the case may
be, and operates between limits, for example, between twenty
and forty PSI. If the pressure falls below twenty PSI, the
pump is activated and continues to operate until the pressure 
in the system is built up to forty PSI, causing the pump to
be turned off by the pressure switch.Typical prior art accumulators include a pressure
vessel having an expansible bag therein which may be either
an inflatable bag which stretches upon the introduction of
air, or which merely unfolds as the air volume increases, or
the expansible bag may unfold and also expand. An air valve
extends through one end of the tank, and an inlet and outlet
aperture is provided at the other end of the tank for fluid
communication with the water system. As water is pumped into
the tank, the bag is forced upwardly by the incoming water.Separator bags or diaphragms in pressure tanks are
either diaphragm-type separators peripherally sealed, or
otherwise attached to the sidewall of the tank, usually at an
assembly seam wherein the tank is formed by a pair of cup-shaped
halves or comprises a removable

(40,42) of said cylindrical ring (38).
A hydropneumatic filament-wound pressure vessel according to claim 1
or claim 2, characterised in that the diaphragm (66) separates an interior cavity of

said unitary pressure vessel liner into a pair of pressure chambers, one-way check
valve means (20) in said liner being adapted to connect one of said pressure

chambers to a source of pressurized air, and filtering means in said liner being
adapted to connect another one of said pressure chambers to a water source.
