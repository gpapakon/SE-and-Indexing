<ABSTRACT>
A phosphate surface-treatment bath which contains a cationic organic polymeric compound (or salt thereof) that contains at least one cationic nitrogen atom and has a molecular weight of 1,000 to 1,000,000 forms a highly corrosion resistant film on metal surfaces (e.g., iron, zinc, aluminum, etc.) that is also an excellent paint undercoat. The film preferably is one in which the resin composed of the cationic organic compound (or salt thereof) has penetrated into the grain boundaries between phosphate crystals with an accompanying formation of a phosphate crystal/resin composite. A film formed in accordance with the present invention affords a remarkable improvement in corrosion resistance and paint adherence, compared with the phosphate conversion achieved with the same treatment, except for the omission of the organic polymer containing cationic nitrogen. In addition, even when the primer coating step is omitted, the present invention exhibits a performance approximately equivalent to the application of a primer coating on a conventional phosphate film.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DescriptionTREATMENT FOR THE FORMATION OF A CORROSION RESISTANT FILMON METAL SURFACESTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a novel treatment ag¬ ent that forms a strongly corrosion-resistant film on the surface of metals such as iron, zinc, aluminum, and the like. This film is also an excellent paint undercoat. Background ArtAt present, increasingly high levels of corrosion re¬ sistance are being reguired of painted objects such as au¬ tomobile bodies and construction materials. Metal surfaces have heretofore been treated by phosphate treatments, chro- ate treatments, etc.; however, the prior metal surface treatment agents do not always exhibit a satisfactory cor¬ rosion resistance and paint adherence.The art is already familiar with the formation of a phosphate film on a metal surface as a generally applicable pretreatment method when organic films, e.g., paints, ad- hesives, and the like, are applied on the surfaces of met¬ als such as iron, zinc, aluminum, and the like. The cor¬ rosion resistance and paint adherence are improved by this addition of a phosphate film on the metal surface prior to the application of the organic coating (typically paint) . When higher levels of corrosion resistance are required, both a phosphate treatment and a post-treatment (e.g. , sealing with chromic acid and the like) or primer appli- cation are carried out prior to painting. However, these post-treatments (e.g., sealing with chromic acid and the like) contribute only minor benefits. Moreover, while the application of a primer does improve the paintability, this also expands the painting process and thus substantially impairs the workability.Nevertheless, primer application is currently required for painted objects such as automobile bodies and construe-SUBSTITUTESHEET 

 tion materials. In the case of automobile bodies, a zinc phosphate film is formed on the metal surface, which is then immersed in aqueous paint for electrodeposition coat¬ ing. This coating operation is a type of primer coating, and its purpose is to increase the corrosion resistance of the painted surface and to secure corrosion resistance for the interior surfaces of the automobile body, which can be difficult to finish coat. A primer coating is similarly applied on construction materials prior to finish coating in order to increase the corrosion resistance.While improvements in operating efficiency and cost reduction in painting operations require a contraction of the process, a satisfactory response to this goal has yet to be
