<ABSTRACT>
A filler neck (10) includes an internal tube that is movable to open and close the filler neck (10). The movable tube (120) is formed to include a fill passageway (132) that is configured to deliver fuel from a fuel-dispensing nozzle (19) to a vehicle fuel tank (12) when the filler neck (10) is open. The fill passageway (132) is closed when the filler neck (10) is opened. An inlet opening (134) is formed in an outer end (122) of the movable tube (120) and an outlet opening (138) is formed in an inner end (128) of the movable tube (120). A filler passageway closure member (140) is appended to a filler neck conduit (16) and positioned to lie in a filler neck vent passageway (42) in spaced-apart relation to the mouth of the conduit (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assembly 
for controlling the filling of a vehicle fuel tank having 
a filler neck, and particularly to a filler neck without 
a removable outer fuel cap. More particularly, the 
present invention relates to a capless filler neck having 
an internal opening and closing mechanism and a liquid 
fuel and fuel vapor handling system which controls the 
discharge of fuel vapors from the tank and the filler 
neck both during and after the filling operation. A removable fuel cap with a sealing gasket 
typically is used to close the open end of a fuel tank 
filler neck. Once the fuel cap is removed from the 
filler neck, the fuel tank is filled, and the fuel-dispensing 
nozzle is withdrawn from the filler neck, the 
fuel cap is reattached to the filler neck so that the 
sealing gasket forms a seal between the fuel cap and the 
filler neck. Thus, the fuel cap closes the open end of 
the filler neck to block discharge of liquid fuel and 
fuel vapor from the fuel tank through the filler neck. 
It is known, however, to place pressure-relief and 
vacuum-relief valves in fuel caps to permit some 
controlled venting of fuel vapors in the filler neck 
while the fuel cap is mounted on the filler neck. It has been observed that fuel caps are often 
lost or damaged over time and, as a result, the open end 
of the filler neck might not be closed and sealed in 
accordance with the original equipment specifications 
during operation of the vehicle. Accordingly, a filler 
neck configured to "open" automatically as a fuel-dispensing 
pump nozzle is inserted into the filler neck 
during refueling and "close" automatically once the  
 
attendant withdraws the pump nozzle from the filler neck 
without requiring the attendant to reattach a fuel cap to 
the filler neck would be an improvement over many 
conventional capped filler neck systems. Although 
conventional fuel caps function to close filler necks in 
a satisfactory manner, it is thought that a capless 
filler neck could make vehicle refueling more convenient 
for the consumer because no action other than inserting a 
pump nozzle into the open end of the filler neck would be 
required to begin refueling a vehicle. Advantageously, 
such a capless filler neck system would be configured in 
accordance with the present invention to include internal 
liquid fuel and fuel vapor control means. Filler necks with self-closing mechanisms are 
known. A capless vehicle refueling system including a 
closure member that is movable by a fuel-dispensing
