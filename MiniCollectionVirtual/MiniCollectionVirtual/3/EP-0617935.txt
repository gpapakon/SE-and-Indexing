<ABSTRACT>
A relatively massive annular body (10) is driven in radial mode 
resonant oscillation by an ultrasonic driver (20) that is fixed 

to the periphery of the annular body (10), with the axis (21) of 
its ultrasonic drive oriented for intersection with the central 

axis of the annular body (10). A selectable chucking device (12) 
within the bore of the annular body is adapted to engage part of 

a prosthetic device (19), to which the resonant oscillation is 
imparted, for melting surrounding bone cement and for severing 

body ingrowth into the prosthetic, thus permitting retraction of 
the prosthetic from its pre-existing implantation in a living 

bone.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to ultrasonic and means for removing an osteal prosthesis
from cemented installation in a living bone, as in the course of revision arthroplasty.It is known from U.S. Patents 4,248,232 and 5,151,099 that ultrasound may be used to
facilitate removal of bone cement (PMMA) during revision arthroplasty. Local heating, by
preferential absorption of ultrasound energy, raises the temperature of a small volume of the
cement above the glass-transition temperature, thus allowing the cement to flow and to be
manipulated into a shape and form which may be readily removed from the revision site.It has also been claimed (Hood, et al., U.S. Patent 5,045,054) that the application of
ultrasound directly to the prosthesis can break the bond between the prosthesis and
surrounding cement or, in the case of uncemented prostheses, between the prosthesis and in-grown
cancellous bone. The direction of applied ultrasonic energy is in line with the central
axis of an implanted prosthetic devise, such as the axis of stem support for the ball of a hip-joint
replacement. But the in-line application of force, as in the context of the Hood, et al.
system, is to require the patient to oppose the force, with inevitable trauma for the patient.It is an object of the invention to provide improved means for dislodging an
installed osteal prosthesis with a minimum of trauma for the patient who is faced with the
need of revision arthroplasty.A specific object is to meet the above object for the case of revision arthroplasty of a hip-joint
prosthesis that has been implanted and cemented in a femur.It is a general object to meet the above objects with an apparatus of reliably high
performance without a daunting level of operating complexity, which method and apparatus
are applicable to the full variety of currently available prostheses. The invention in its preferred embodiment allows an ultrasonically driven
technique to be carried out
wherein an annular body of relatively great mass is solidly chucked around the
exposed proximal end of a hip-joint prosthesis which has been cemented in the medullary
canal of a femur. In most cases, the exposed proximal end is a sphere or ball at the
projecting end of a stem, all integrally formed with the implanted remainder of the prosthetic
device. The annular body is excited into ultrasonic radial-mode oscillation by a driver having
a directional axis of mechanical oscillation, wherein the said axis is preferably radially inward
through body material, toward the body axis, and

<CLAIMS>
A radial-mode resonant device characterised in that it comprises an annular body (10,40)
having a central axial bore (11) and an ultrasonic driver (20) having a central axis (21)

of mechanically resonant oscillation directed generally radially inwardly with respect
to the central axis of said body (10).
An ultrasonically driven tool comprising a collet means (12) in combination with a radial-mode
resonant device as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the collet means (12)

comprises resiliently deformable means to define an engagement zone whereby energy
from said resonant device may be delivered to a prosthesis.
An ultrasonically driven tool for use in revision arthroplasty as claimed in claim 2,
for removing a prosthetic member at least partially encumbered by bone

cement, characterised in that said collet means (12) is so adapted selectively to engage
an exposed portion of said prosthetic member (19) with said body (10,40),

and in that ultrasonic vibration with said oscillation axis (21) directed generally radially
inwardly may be transmitted to said prosthetic member.
A tool as claimed in either claim 2 or claim 3, characterised in that said body (10,40) is a
cylindrical annulus.
A tool as claimed any one of claims 2 to 4, characterised in that said body (10,40) has a
mean diameter, intermediate an inner diameter and an outer diameter, where said mean

diameter has a circular circumferential extent which is substantially an integral
multiple of wavelengths at the frequency of mechanically resonant oscillation of said

at least one driver.
A tool as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 5, characterised in that said body (40) is a
dished solid having a concave conical first end face at one end of said bore (11) and a

convex conical second end face at the opposite end of said bore, the connection of
said at least one driver to said body (10) being such that the oscillation axis (21) is on 

such an alignment that, in addition to said generally radially inwardly direction, it is
sloped in general to accord with the respective conical slopes of said end faces.
A tool as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that said first end face slopes with a
conical apex angle that is less than that of said second end face, and in that the

oscillation axis (21) is directed inwardly at a slope that is intermediate the slopes of
said end faces.
A tool as claimed in any one of claims 2 to 7, characterised in that said collet (12) is
provided with at least two longitudinally extending finger means (16,17) connected one to

another at one longitudinal end, and arranged to engage at an opposite longitudinal
end a portion of said prosthesis, and in that coacting cam or other formations on outer

zones of said fingers (16,17) or on the surface of said bore (11) are arranged to cause
engagement and releasable clamping of a portion of said prosthesis member.
A tool as claimed in claim 8, characterised in that said body (10) has a generally
cylindrical bore (11), and said coacting cam formation may comprise a frusto-conical

taper of said bore, and/or a radially outwardly directed flange at said one longitudinal
end of said collet (12), or screw means acting on said flange.
