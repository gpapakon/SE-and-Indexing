<ABSTRACT>
A system supports the use of audio information
cursors and Quick Info Windows. The audio information cursors

provide audio information about objects to which the cursors
point. For instance, an audio information cursor may provide

audio output specifying the name of an object to which the
cursor points. Quick Info Windows are windows that are

generated to provide information about objects shown on a
video display. Each Quick Info Window initially includes a

pointer that points to the object associated with the window.
The Quick Info Window provides information such as the name of

the object, the purpose of the object and how to use the
object.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to data 
processing systems and, more particularly, to display of 
objects on video displays in data processing systems. Many operating systems provide a cursor that 
indicates a current position on a video display. The 
cursor is generally manipulable by an input device, such 
as a keyboard or a mouse. In certain operating systems, 
such as the Microsoft WINDOWS, version 3.1, operating 
system, which is sold by Microsoft Corporation of Redmond, 
Washington, a window may have a status bar that displays 
information about the object to which the cursor is 
currently pointing. As the cursor is moved to point at 
different objects, the contents of the status bar changes 
accordingly. The status bar is a separate graphic entity 
that is not connected to the cursor and does not move with 
the cursor. The status bar is positioned on the video 
display at a fixed location within a window. As such, a 
user has to look at two separate portions of the screen if 
he wishes to view both the cursor and the status bar. 
This separation of the status bar from the cursor can be 
confusing and burdensome to the user. The limitations associated with the use of a 
status bar are overcome by the present invention. In 
accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a 
method is practiced in a data processing system having a 
video display, an output device and an input device. In 
this method, objects, including a cursor, are displayed on 
the video display. The cursor is positioned over at least  
 
a portion of one of the objects that is displayed, in 
response to a user using the input device. Audio 
information about the object that at least a portion of 
the cursor is over is output on the audio output device. In accordance with another aspect of the present 
invention, a method is practiced in a data processing 
system having a video display, an audio output device and 
a mouse. In this method, a source object icon associated 
with a source object is displayed on the video display. A 
target object icon associated with a target object is also 
displayed on the video display. In response to the user 
using the mouse, a cursor is positioned to be over at 
least a portion of the source object icon. In response to 
the cursor being over at least a portion of the source 
object icon, audio information is output on the audio 
output device about the source object. In response to the 
user using the mouse, the source object icon is dragged 
across the video display until the

In a data processing system having a video 
display, an audio output device and an input device, a method, 

comprising the steps of: 
   displaying objects on the video display, said 

objects including a cursor; 
   in response to a user using the input device, 

positioning the cursor over at least a portion of a selected 
one of the objects that is displayed; and 

   in response to the cursor being positioned over at 
least a portion of the selected object, outputting audio 

information about the selected object on the audio output 
device and displaying information about the selected object as 

part of the cursor on the video display. 
The method recited in claim 1 wherein the 
information displayed in the displaying information step is a 

name of the selected object. 
The method recited in claim 1 wherein the step 
of outputting audio information about the selected object 

further comprises the step of outputting audio information 
corresponding to a name of the selected object. 
The method recited in claim 1 wherein the input 
device is a mouse and the step of positioning the cursor over 

at least a portion of the selected object is performed in 
response to the user using the mouse. 
The method recited in claim 1 wherein the input 
device is a keyboard and the step of positioning the cursor 

over at least a portion of the selected object is performed in 
response to the user using the keyboard. 
In a data processing system having a video 
display, an audio output device and a mouse, a method 

comprising the steps of: 
   displaying a source object icon associated with a
