<ABSTRACT>
In a telecommunications duplicated synchronous switch where switching in bit 
synchronism is carried out and fault detection is by discrepancy checking between the 

duplicate switch planes, determination of the faulty plane is provided by the data being 
carried in switched bytes grouped into data frames, each frame carrying check data in 

respect of data from an earlier frame. Corruption of data in a frame is thus indicated by 
information in a later frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
Problems are experienced with the operation of a telecommunications duplicated
synchronous switch where switching in bit synchronism is carried out and fault detection is
carried out by discrepancy checking between the duplicate switch planes. The detection of
the existence of a fault is relatively simple, but the determination of which plane is faulty is
more problematical.EP-A-093 523 (PLESSEY) discloses duplicated switch planes in which data is
switched in one plane and data check information is switched in the second plane.Use of a simple priority bit per switch plane replica only allows partial
identification of the faulty switching plane.According to the present invention there is provided a telecommunications switch
fabric for switching data bytes, characterised in that the switch fabric comprises means for
grouping the switched bytes into data frames, wherein each frame comprises check data in
respect of data from an earlier frame.The present invention also provides a method for data transmission in a
telecommunications switch fabric characterised by the steps of carrying data in switched
bytes, grouping the switched bytes into data frames and inserting check data into each
frame in respect of data from an earlier frame. The present invention will now be described by way of example, with reference to
the attached drawings, in which;
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a basic message sequence for carrying
out the present invention;Figure 2 shows examples of multi-frame formats for use in the present invention;Figures 3 to 6 show an example of a Dual Plane Checking Algorithm for use in the
present invention; andFigures 7 to 9 show block diagrams of various examples of options for control of
port access.It is proposed that switch maintenance be carried out using switch check and address
data calculated including at least a part of a previous data frame possibly in 
conjunction with discrepancy checking between duplicate planes. Furthermore it is
proposed that the introduction of errors in the data frames when connections are changed
can be used to a) confirm the changed connection and b) to check routinely error
detection mechanisms during normal operation.This is achieved by using an additional bit per byte switched. This bit is encoded
over a data frame with the input channel address and a parity or CRC check on the
previous data frame. Any data corruption or misrouting will be detected by discrepancy
failure between switch planes. Subsequent failure of the check bit in the multi-frame
