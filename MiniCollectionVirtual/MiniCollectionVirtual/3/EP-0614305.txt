<ABSTRACT>
A voice/image simultaneous communication 
apparatus which can transmit image data while permitting 

talking with higher efficiency by encoding voice and 
synthesizing voice coded data and image data than by 

multiplexing frequencies. The voice/image simultaneous 
communication apparatus is constructed of a voice coder 

(16) for coding an analog voice signal, a voice decoder 
(17) for decoding the coded voice into an analog voice 

signal, a data synthesizer (7) for synthesizing image 
coded data and voice coded data, a data separator (8) 

for separating synthesized coded data into image coded 
data and voice coded data, and a modem (9) capable of 

performing full duplex communication. The data 
synthesizer (7) can change the ratio of synthesis 

between voice coded data and image coded data in 
accordance with the data transmission speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for
transmitting a voice simultaneously with image data and
more particularly to a voice/image simultaneous
communication apparatus which performs communication by
converting a voice into digital data.As a technique of transmitting a plurality of
pieces of information by using the telephone line, a
technique of transmitting a voice simultaneously with
other information signals by securing less deterioration
in voice quality is introduced in JP-B 55-28616.In this prior art, information signals are
transmitted within a central band portion having a flat
characteristic in a telephone transmission band of from
0.3kHz to 3.4kHz and therefore, the quality of
information signals can be maintained and in addition
low frequency components and high frequency components
of a voice can serve to lessen deterioration in voice
quality.However, in an application to, for example,
facsimile wherein a modulation signal having a
modulation band which occupies most of the transmission
band of telephone line is transmitted as an information
signal, the frequency-multiplexed simultaneous
transmission of a voice signal and an information signal 
as in the aforementioned prior art is difficult to
achieve.The present invention intends to solve the
above prior art problems and it is an object of the
invention to provide a voice/image simultaneous
communication apparatus which can transmit an
information signal such as a facsimile and a voice
signal simultaneously.The above object can be accomplished by a
voice/image simultaneous communication apparatus
as set out in the claims. Such an apparatus comprises
image input means, image coder means, image
decoder means, image output means, voice input/output
means, voice coder means, voice decoder means, data
synthesizer means, data separator means, data modem
means, circuit connecting means and system controller
means.Image data read by the image input means is
compressively coded by the image coder means and
inputted to the data synthesizer means. An analog voice
signal inputted through the voice input/output means is
compressively coded by the voice coder means and applied
to the data synthesizer means. The data synthesizer
means synthesizes image coded data and voice coded data
through a predetermined method and delivers resulting
data to the data modem means. The data modem means
modulates the synthesized coded data into an analog 
signal and transmits it to a telephone line through the
circuit connecting means.On the other hand, a signal
