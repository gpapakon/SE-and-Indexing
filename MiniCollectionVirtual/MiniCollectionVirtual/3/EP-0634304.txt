<ABSTRACT>
Method of loading or unloading a container onto a vehicle being a 
truck (1), a trailer of a semi-trailer or a trailer having 

wheels, a support bed for a container (41) and a front end and 
rear end which comprises utilising a lifter mounted to the 

vehicle to lift one end of a container resting on the 
ground, relatively moving the rear end 

of the vehicle and said one end towards one another so that 
said one end locates above said rear end and drawing the 

container over said rear end and onto the support bed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to transporting. In particular aspects, this invention relates to methods 
and apparatus for transporting containers. The use of containers of a standard size for transporting 
goods has become so common that ships, wharves, cranes, 
lifters, fork lifters and other apparatus have been 
specifically designed and built for the purpose of handling 
such containers. However, many problems remain particularly at sites or in 
situations where a small number of containers are dealt 
with as compared with situations in which a large number of 
containers are dealt with. Thus, a wharf may well be able to afford and effectively 
use an overhead lifter costing many millions of dollars for 
the purpose of lifting containers off, and placing 
containers on, trucks but a small business can not afford 
such a lifter or even have the space in which to install 
such a lifter. Next, fork lifters are available but need to work from a 
side of a truck but not all businesses can afford such a 
fork lift or have the land space to enable such a fork 
lifter to work. Further, even in places where substantial lifters are 
available, trucks still need to wait in turn and queue to 
have containers loaded and unloaded from them.  The applicant believes that substantial improvements in 
transporting can be obtained. The present invention provides:-
 
a method of loading a container onto a vehicle being a 
truck, a trailer of a semi-trailer or a trailer which 
vehicle having wheels, a support bed for a container and a 
front end and rear end which comprises utilising a lifter 
mounted to the vehicle to lift one end of a container 
resting on the ground or other substrate, relatively moving 
the rear end of the vehicle and said one end towards one 
another so that said one end locates above said rear end 
and drawing the container over said rear end and onto the 
support bed. The present invention also provides:-
 
a method of unloading a container from a vehicle being a 
truck, a trailer of a semi-trailer or a trailer which 
vehicle having wheels, a support bed for a container and a 
front end and a rear end which comprises utilising a lifter 
mounted to the vehicle to lift one end of a container 
located on the support bed, relatively moving the rear end 
of said vehicle and said one end towards one another so 
that the other end of the container becomes to rest on the 
ground or other substrate, relatively moving the rear end 
of the vehicle and the container away from one another so 
that said one end is

<CLAIMS>
A method of loading a container onto a vehicle being 
a truck, a trailer of a semi-trailer or a trailer 

which vehicle having wheels, a support bed for a 
container and a front end and rear end which comprises 

utilising a lifter mounted to the vehicle to lift one 
end of a container resting on the ground or other 

substrate, relatively moving the rear end of the 
vehicle and said one end towards one another so that 

said one end locates above said rear end and drawing 
the container over said rear end and onto the support 

bed. 
A method of unloading a container from a vehicle being 
a truck, a trailer of a semi-trailer or a trailer 

which vehicle having wheels, a support bed for a 
container and a front end and rear end which 

comprises utilising a lifter mounted to the vehicle to 
lift one end of a container located on the support 

bed, relatively moving the rear end of said vehicle 
and said one end towards one another so that the other 

end of the container becomes to rest on the ground or 
other substrate, relatively moving the rear end of the 

vehicle and the container away from one another so 
that said one end is located rearwardly of said rear 

end and lowering said one end to the ground or other 
substrate. 
Apparatus for loading a container onto a vehicle being 
a truck, a trailer of a semi-trailer or a trailer 

which vehicle having wheels, a support bed for a 
container and a front end and a rear end, the 

apparatus comprising a lifter adapted to be mounted to 
the vehicle for lifting one end of a container resting 

on the ground or other substrate whereby, on relative 
movement of the rear end of the vehicle and said one 

 
end towards one another to being said one end, to 

locate above said rear end and adapted to draw the 
container over said rear end and onto the support bed. 
Apparatus for unloading a container from a vehicle 
being a truck, a trailer of a semi-trailer or a 

trailer which vehicle having wheels, a support bed for 
a container and a front end and a rear end, the 

apparatus comprising a lifter adapted to be mounted to 
the vehicle for lifting one end of a container located 

on the support bed whereby, on relative movement to 
the rear end of said vehicle and said one end towards 

one another, to bring the other end of the container 
to rest on the ground or other substrate and adapted 

after relative movement of the rear end of the vehicle 
and the container away from one another so that said 

one end is located rearwardly of said rear and to 
lower said one end to the ground or other substrate. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 3 comprising means for 
connecting to the upper end of a container, first 

telescopic means for moving the means for connecting 
upwards, second telescopic means connected to the 

first telescopic means and adapted to telescope in a 
direction generally at right angles to the direction 

of telescoping of the first telescopic means and 

wherein the second telescopic means is adapted to be 
mounted to said vehicle for pivoting movement for and 

aft of the vehicle about an axis extending 
transversely of the vehicle. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein mounting 
means is provided for mounting one end of the second 

telescopic means to the vehicle. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5, wherein the first 
telescopic means is located at the other end of the 

 
second telescopic means. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 5 wherein, the means for 
connecting comprises locks which are known. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 wherein, the vehicle 
is provided with a roller or a skid plate at the rear 

end. 
Apparatus as claimed in Claim 8 wherein, if a skid 
plate is provided it is preferred that it can tilt 

about an axis generally transverse of the vehicle. 
Apparatus for loading a container on to a vehicle 
substantially as hereinbefore described with reference 

to any one of the accompanying drawings. 
The steps, features, compositions and compounds 
referred to or indicated in the specification and/or 

claims of this application, individually or 
collectively, and any and all combinations or any two
