<ABSTRACT>
An exercise device for uniformly developing and 
conditioning the parts of the body. The device has a body 

support unit, an exercise loading unit, a leg support unit, a 
knee support unit, a reaction restraining unit and a back 

plate support unit and develops and conditions muscles by 
providing multidirectional exercises, i.e., upward, downward, 

frontward, backward, inward and outward exercises, for the 
upper and lower body. Particularly, this device easily 

efficiently provides a simple walking exercise of legs as well 
as a calf muscle exercise according to an ankle exercise, a 

thigh muscle exercise according to a knee exercise, an 
abdominal muscle exercise according to the thigh muscle 

exercise and etc. The exercise loading unit of this invention 
can be easily
 located at various positions corresponding to 
several kinds of exercises.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to exercise
devices, and more particularly to an exercise device provided
with an exercise loading unit which is generally used for
upward, downward, frontward, backward, leftward, rightward,
inward and outward exercises, thereby allowing the user to
selectively or compositely carry out the upward, downward,
frontward, backward, leftward, rightward, inward and outward
exercises and developing and conditioning various parts of the
body.Known exercise devices generally use loading force
generated by load means, such as a weight, a spring or a
hydraulic cylinder, and provide individual exercises, thereby
having a disadvantage in that they allow the user to develop
and condition his body by only one of three directional
exercises, i.e., frontward and backward exercise, leftward and
rightward exercise and upward and backward exercise.For example, a known weight lifting machine has an
intrinsic use suitable for an upward exercise of arms, a known 
muscling machine has an intrinsic use suitable for an inward
exercise of the leftward and rightward exercise, a known
rowing machine has an intrinsic use suitable for a pulling
exercise of arms and a known running machine has an
intrinsic use suitable for a downward exercise of legs.
Exercise machines for the legs have also been developed for
use in either the sitting or lying flat position. One such
device is disclosed in US Patent No. 4 169 589.In addition, there have been proposed several types
of physiotherapy instruments, a kind of medical instrument.
Like the aforementioned exercise devices, these
physiotherapy instruments allow a unidirectional exercise,
for example, repeated upward and downward exercise in the
case of a known leg physiotherapy instrument.As described above, such known exercise devices and
physiotherapy instruments provide specified directional
exercises and, in this regard, it is required to prepare
several exercise devices having specified uses when the user
intends to develop and condition various parts of his body
by all of the directional exercises. This inevitably causes
difficulty in preparation of several exercise devices, that
is, remarkable capital investment in buying individual
exercise devices and a real problem in locating the exercise
devices in a room of an ordinary home.Because of the above problem, the user who intends to
develop and condition various parts of his body inevitably
use a sport center or a health club which is equipped with
several types of exercise devices.
