<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a photosensitive material for the production of planographic printing plates, which contains   a) a layer support which is suitable for planographic printing plates, b) a hydrophilic layer which contains a crosslinkable organic polymer or is a layer formed by crosslinking such a polymer,   c) a photopolymerisable layer and   d) a transparent top film, where the adhesion of the photopolymerisable layer (c) to the hydrophilic layer (b) and/or the top film (d) is modified by exposure. The material allows the production of high-performance (heavy-duty) planographic printing plates without use of liquid processing agents, for example developers.

layer (c) to the hydrophilic layer (b) and/or the

cover film (d) is modified by exposure to light, is
exposed with an image through the cover film (d) and

is developed by peeling the cover film (d) from the
layer support (a), characterised in that a material

having a hydrophilic layer (b) is used, which layer 
contains a crosslinkable organic polymer and the

polymer crosslinks before or after the exposure to
light.
