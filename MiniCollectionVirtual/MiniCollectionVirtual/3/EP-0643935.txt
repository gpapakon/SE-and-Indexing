<ABSTRACT>
A process control operator workstation (10) 
ergonomically designed to provide a plurality of consoles 

(12,16,18,20) integrally mountable in a substantially part-circular 
configuration wherein the individual operator 

console (12) provides a variable height keyboard countertop 
(38), a video display monitor (14) that is adjustable 

vertically, horizontally and rotationally as well as being 
tiltable, and an integral rotatable side-panel (40) mounted 

to the video display monitor (14) for containing various 
control modules within easy reach of the operator while 

viewing the monitor, thus providing a comfortable 
workstation adaptable to operators in the size range of 5% 

female to 95% male as defined in the anthropometric tables 
of The Human Factors Society Inc.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to process control
workstations and to operator consoles.The science of ergonomics deals with the design of
equipment and tools so as to make the equipment and tools
easily used by the human operator without undue fatigue.
The ease of such use as well as the minimizing of strain
and fatigue involves designing the tool and equipment to
maintain proper orientation with the human operator. As
is readily apparent, the "human operator" is
an extremely variable entity and different
individuals have varying height, reach,
angular movement, and differ in various 
other dimensions all of which must be considered in the
proper design of the equipment that the operator will use
or interface. This variation of human operators has been
outlined in tables created by THE HUMAN FACTORS SOCIETY
INC. which variations are summarized in the table of Fig.
1. In this particular table, various anthropometric data
are provided which represents the U.S. civilian body
dimension for ages 20 to 60 years as determined by J.T.
McConville of Yellow Springs, Ohio in his Anthropology
Research Project and by K.W. Kennedy in his USAF-AMRL-HEG
paper presented in 1985. The later paper is based on
military data excerpted from the McConville Research
Project of 1978.Turning specifically to operator workstations and
their consoles of the type used in process control rooms,
the application of ergonomic design consisted, for the most
part, of an attempt to provide compatibility of the console
with an operator of normal or average anthropometric
values. Adjustability of the video display screens
consisted usually of making the screen tiltable to provide
a good orientation of the video screen to the face of the
operator. The dimensioning of the operator's height with
respect to the console retaining the screen, for the most
part, consisted of a chair being vertically and 
rotationally adjustable. These adjustments, although
providing a certain modicum of compatibility of the
operator to the workstation, left out certain other key
factors dealing with the fatigue of the operator such as
proper angle of the legs with respect to the buttocks in
the seated position as well as the angular orientation of
the wrist with respect to the keyboard.Another problem in operator workstation interfaces
involved the poor or inadequate location of various status
displays and actuators that may have to be operator
actuated in response to conditions viewed on the monitor
screen by the operator while inputting or monitoring
process
