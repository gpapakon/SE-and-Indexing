<ABSTRACT>
The filler piece proposed consists of an elastomer extrusion (1) with several part-cylindrical recesses (3, 4) and a hot-melt adhesive coating (2). This ensures that, when a shrink-fit hose is shrunk on to the assembly of filler piece and cables, the temperature distribution over the cross-sectional area of the filler piece is uniform and the hot-melt adhesive reaches its melting point even in the middle of the extrusion.

<CLAIMS>
Filler piece for sealing cables, comprising an 
elastomeric profiled piece (1) having a plurality of recesses 

(3, 4), in the form of circular-cylinder sectors, and a 
sheathing of a hot-melt adhesive (2), which sheathing in the 

cross-section extends over the profiled piece's (1) total 
circumference. 
Filler piece according to Claim 1, the elastomeric 
profiled piece consisting of SBR/NBR/polychloroprene. 
Filler piece according to Claim 1 or 2, the elastomeric 
material of the profiled piece containing an adhesion-activating 

additive, in particular based on an anhydride-modified EVA 
comonomer. 
Filler piece according to Claim 1 or 2, the surface of 
the elastomeric profiled piece (1) being treated with an 

adhesion promoter. 
Filler piece according to Claim 4, the adhesion promoter 
being a halogenizing preparation with polychloroprene solution. 
Filler piece according to Claim 4, the surface of the 
profiled piece being hydroaromatically cyclized or polarized in 

such a way that, on heating to the melting temperature of the 
hot-melt adhesive, a diffusion crosslinking with the hot-melt 

adhesive occurs. 
Filler piece according to one of Claims 1 to 6, the 
sheathing extending only over part of the length of the profiled 

piece (1).
