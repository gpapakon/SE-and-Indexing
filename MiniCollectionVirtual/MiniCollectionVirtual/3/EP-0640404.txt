<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for producing, on a metal plate, by means of a projecting threaded bolt of said metal plate, a coating-free connection to an attachment part, and the invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out this process. The object of the present invention is thus to provide a process and a covering cap for carrying out the process, in order to avoid the previous disadvantages of such processes and, in particular, to shorten the assembly time which is necessary.

Method for the paint-free, electrically conductive 
fastening of an add-on part (2) to a matching 

location (4) in the case of a threaded stud (3) of an 
otherwise painted metal sheet (1), having the following 

method steps: 

fastening the covering cap (6) to a threaded stud 
(3), 
fastening the threaded stud (3) to a metal sheet 
(1),
 
and then, one after another: 
applying the paint (12) to the covering cap (6) and 
to the metal sheet (1), after the end face (7) of 

the covering cap (6) is resting on the matching 
location (4), 
loosening the covering cap (6) from the matching 
location (4), 
interposing the add-on part (2) and 
pressing the add-on part (2) on the matching location 
(4) by pressing the covering cap (6) onto the 

add-on part (2). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the fastening of the threaded stud (3) on the metal 

sheet (1) is done by means of stud welding. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the fastening of the threaded stud (3) on the metal 

sheet (1) is done by means of riveting. 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the fastening or loosening of the 

covering cap (6) on the threaded stud (3) is done by  
 

means of an internal thread (16) in the covering cap (6). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the fastening or loosening of the 

covering cap (6) on the threaded stud (3) is done by 
means of projections (17) which project into the blind 

hole (18) in the covering cap (6) and engage removably 
into the thread (13) of the threaded stud (3). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the end face (7) is brought to the 

same height as the matching location (4) even before 
fastening the threaded stud (3) on the metal sheet (1). 
Covering cap for covering the area surrounding a 
threaded stud (3) and fastening an add-on part (2), in 

particular according to the method of Claims 1 to 6, 
having 


a blind hole (18), 
a flat end face (7) around the opening (19) of the 
blind hole (18) and 
projections (17) which project from the walls of the 
blind hole (18) into the interior thereof, 

transversally to the longitudinal direction of the 
blind h
ole,
 
characterized in that 


a) the end face (7) has external dimensions which are 
equal to or larger than the bearing surface (20) of the 

add-on part (2) and 
b) a clearance (8) arranged on the inner circumference of 
the opening (19) in the blind hole (18), the said 

clearance being dimensioned such that material (21) 
thrown out from the welding or riveting of the threaded 

stud (3) or of the thread (13) finds room therein. 
Covering cap according to Claim 7, characterized 
in that the projections (17) are an internal thread (16) 

fitting the external thread (13). 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 and 8, characterized in that the covering cap 

(6) consists of a nut part (9) and a cap part (10), the 
nut part (9) having an external contour of a regular 

polygon with mutually adjacent contact faces (15).  
 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 9, characterized in that the contact faces 

(15) of the outer face of the nut part (9) fall away 
towards its contact edges (22). 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 10, characterized in that the tool to engage 

on the outer contour of the nut part (9) is configured 
such that the force transmission to the contact faces 

(15) is not applied in the vicinity of their contact 
edges (22). 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 11, characterized in that the clearance (8) 

has a rectangular cross-sectional contour with the edges 
essentially parallel to the end face (7) and/or the inner 

circumference of the blind hole (18). 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 12, characterized in that 


the projections (17) are arranged only in two 
opposite sectors of the circumference of the blind hole 

(18), and the covering cap (6) can be pressed together 
resiliently to such an extent that the projections (17) 

and the thread (13) come into or out of engagement, 
the cap part (10) and the nut part (9) can be locked 
into one another and the projections (17) are arranged in 

the cap part (10) made of plastic. 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 13, characterized in that the covering cap 

(6) consists of metal. 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 14, characterized in that the covering cap 

(6) has a large and protected surface. 
Covering cap according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 15, characterized in that the opening in the 

add-on part (2) to receive the threaded stud (3) does not 
have a closed circumference but is open to such an extent 

that the add-on part (2) can be pushed along transversely 
to make it rest on the threaded stud (3).
