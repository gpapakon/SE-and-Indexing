<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
ethylene copolymer which exhibits higher melt tension and 
higher transparency than known ethylene copolymers. Ethylene/α-olefin copolymers having a density of 
not higher than 0.940 g/cm³ are known as linear low 
density polyethylenes (LLDPE). Such linear low density 
polyethylenes are superior to high density polyethylenes 
in transparency, impact resistance, and environmental 
stress cracking resistance (ESCR), and are superior to 
high-pressure low-density polyethylenes in impact 
resistance and creep resistance. Therefore, LLDPE's are 
widely used in the fields of packing materials, especially 
as packing films and laminating films. The LLDPE, however, is inferior to high-pressure 
low-density polyethylenes in transparency and melt 
elasticity, therefore having disadvantages of less 
transparency of the film, less stability of the bubble in 
inflation molding, and larger neck-in. Conventional high-pressure 
LDPE's are superior to LLDPE's in transparency 
but are inferior in mechanical strength such as tensile 
strength at break. Moreover, when the ratio of α-olefin 
comonomer is increased to lower the density of 
LLDPE, slip properties of the laminated film are impaired, 
blocking of the film is caused, heat-sealing properties  
 
are limited because of broad distribution of the comonomer 
composition. JP-A-60-88016 discloses improvement of 
transparency, low-temperature heat-sealability, and anti-blocking 
properties by adjustment of composition 
distribution and other characteristics. However, such 
LLDPE is not improved in melt elasticity. It is an object of the present invention to provide an 
ethylene copolymer which is excellent in melt elasticity, 
transparency, and heat-sealability. This object could be achieved on the basis 
of the finding that an 
ethylene/α-olefin copolymer is 
remarkably improved in transparency, heat-sealing 
properties, and melt elasticity without impairing the 
properties of conventional LLDPE, when its activation 
energy of loss elastic modulus is higher than that of 
conventional LLDPE independently of frequency and its 
Mw/Mn ratio is not higher than 3. The copolymer of the present invention is an 
ethylene/α-olefin copolymer formed by copolymerization of 
ethylene with an α-olefin of three or more carbons, 
satisfying the conditions: 
(A) MFR ranging from 0.001 to 100 g/10min,  (B) density (d) ranging from 0.86 to 0.94 g/cm³, (C) ratio (Mw/Mn) of weight-average molecular weight (Mw) 
to number-average molecular weight
