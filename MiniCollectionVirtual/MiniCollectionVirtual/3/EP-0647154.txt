<ABSTRACT>
In a braking device for roller skates (1), especially single-track roller skates, with a brake block (5) which is removably secured to the skate (2) or the boot (1), the brake block (5) is secured to the skate (2) or the boot to pivot against the force of a spring (6), thus permitting gentle application of the brake. At the same time, maximum braking is possible in emergencies owing to an extension or part of the brake block (5) which bears or can be moved against a roller without the risk of unbalancing the skater during braking.

A braking device (4) for roller skates (1), in particular 
in-line roller skates, with a brake block (5) capable of being 

placed on the ground, which brake block is detachably mounted on 
the frame (2) of the roller skate or on the boot (1) and is 

connected to the frame (2) of the roller skate or to the boot 
(1) so as to be pivotable about a pivot axis (10) extending 

substantially in parallel to the axes (9) of the running rollers 
(3), against the force of a spring (6), a running roller braking 

element (15; 22; 25; 30) connected with the brake block (5) 
being pressable to the running surface of at least one running 

roller (3) with frictional contact when the brake block (5) is 
pivoted, characterised in that the brake block (5) or a holder 

part (7) thereof is guided in a guide slot or guideway (18, 19; 
20; 24; 27; 31) located at a distance from the pivot axis (10; 

9; 29) of the brake block (5), the running roller braking 
element (15; 22; 25; 30) being pressable to the running roller 

(3) with the brake block (5) or the holder part (7) being 
supported in the guide slot or guideway (18, 19; 20, 24; 27; 

31), respectively, when the brake block (5) is pivoted. 
A braking device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the running roller braking element (22; 29) has a 

frictional surface having a contour partially surrounding the 
running roller (3). 
A braking device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the guide slot (20; 24; 27) has a slot extending 

inclinedly to the longitudinal direction of the boot, the 
running roller braking element (15; 22; 25) being slidably 

displaceable relative to the running roller (3) with the brake 
block (5) or holder part (7) being supported on a slanted face 

of the guide slot (20; 24; 27), when the brake block (5) is 
pivoted. 
A braking device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the pivot axis (9; 29) of the brake block 

(5) or of the holder part (7), respectively, coincides with the  
 

axis (9) of the rearmost running roller (3) of the boot (1) or 
is arranged behind that axis (9). 
A braking device according to any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the running roller braking element 

connected with the brake block (5) is designed as a braking 
roller (22). 
A braking device according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the axis (23) of the braking roller (22) is displaceably 

arranged in the guide slot (24). 
A braking device according to any one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the spring acting on the brake block (5) 

is a compression spring (6; 28). 
A braking device according to claim 7, characterised in 
that the holder part (7) of the brake block (5) comprises a 

spring plate (13) for one end of the compression spring (6), the 
other end of the compression spring (6) being accommodated in a 

recess (14) on the frame (2) of the roller skate or on the boot 
(1). 
A braking device according to claim 7 or 8, characterised 
in that the compression spring (6; 28) has a progressive spring 

characteristic.
