<ABSTRACT>
A method, and an assembly comprising a printed circuit board (1) 
and at least 

one component (4), a connection leg (3) of the component being 
wave-soldered to the printed 

circuit board (1), while any excess solder between adjacent 
connection legs (3) and between a 

connection leg (3) and the printed circuit board (1) is prevented 
in that the connection leg (3) lies 

against the printed circuit board (1) or in that the connection 
leg (3) comprises an end portion (7) 

connected to the printed circuit board (1) and an intermediate 
portion (8) situated between the 

end portion (7) and the envelope (5), while at least a side of the 
intermediate portion (8) remote 

from the printed circuit board (1) is solder-repellent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an assembly of a printed circuit board and at least 
one component, which component is provided with an envelope and at least one 
connection leg projecting from the envelope and connected to the printed circuit board 
by means of wave soldering. The invention also relates to another, similar assembly and to a method of 
fastening a component to a printed circuit board. In such an assembly, known from US-A 4796796, and such a method, 
components are fastened to a printed circuit board with glue before the printed circuit 
board with the components glued thereto are passed through a wave of solder. During 
soldering of components with connection legs situated at a comparatively small distance 
from one another in this manner, connections are also created between the connection 
legs of one and the same component and between connection legs of components 
situated next to one another owing to the uncontrollable, comparatively large quantity of 
solder which is passed along the connection legs. The solder adheres to the entire 
connection leg and is also caught between the connection legs. After the printed circuit 
board has been passed through the wave, the solder contracts owing to its surface 
tension. The contraction causes an agglomeration of solder. If an agglomeration of 
solder touches two adjacent connection legs, a bridge will be formed between the 
connection legs. The invention has for its object to provide an assembly in which 
components with connection legs situated at a comparatively small distance from one 
another are connected to a printed circuit board by wave soldering, while electrical 
interconnections between the connection legs are prevented. The assembly according to the invention is for this purpose characterized 
in that the connection leg comprises an end portion connected to the printed circuit 
board and an intermediate portion situated between the end portion and the envelope, at 
least a side of the intermediate portion remote from the printed circuit board being free 
from solder.  This is achieved in that, before wave soldering, it is ensured that the end 
portion attracts solder and the side of the intermediate portion remote from the printed 
circuit board repels solder. The intermediate portion limits the height of the solderable 
portion of the connection leg measured from the printed circuit board. Since solder 
adheres to the end portion only, and not to the side of the intermediate portion remote 
from the printed circuit board, the
