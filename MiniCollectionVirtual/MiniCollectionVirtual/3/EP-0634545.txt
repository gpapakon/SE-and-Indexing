<ABSTRACT>
A remote control system (1) wherein a transmitter 
(3), following closure of a push-button switch (16), 

provides for cyclically generating a digital code, which 
cyclic generation of the code is cut off automatically 

at the end of a predetermined time (T) following closure 
of the switch (16); the system (1) also including a 

receiver (5) for detecting the generated code and 
enabling or disabling an alarm system (7) connected to 

the receiver (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an actuator 
remote control system, particularly for vehicles. Actuator remote control systems are known 
comprising a transmitter conveniently housed in a small 
portable casing, and a receiver installed on a vehicle 
and connected to the actuator means of the vehicle alarm 
system. The transmitter generates a digital code which is 
picked up and decoded by the receiver for 
enabling/disabling the alarm system and one or more 
actuators, e.g. for locking/unlocking the vehicle doors, 
luggage compartment door, fuel filler cover, etc. Known transmitters present at least one 
push-button switch on the casing, which, when closed, 
provides for supplying the transmitter and generating 
the code. To re-transmit the code, the button must be 
released and pressed again. As such, in the event the code transmitted the 
first time the switch is operated fails to be picked up  
 
by the receiver, e.g. on account of misalignment of the 
transmitter and receiver, the button must be released 
and pressed again and the transmitter oriented each time 
until the code is finally picked up. This therefore makes enabling/disabling of the 
alarm system and actuators extremely troublesome. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a remote control system featuring a transmitter 
designed to overcome the drawbacks typically associated 
with known transmitters. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a remote control system as described in Claim 
1. The present invention will be described with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 shows an electric block diagram of an 
actuator remote control system in accordance with the 
teachings of the present invention; Figure 2 shows an operating block diagram of the 
Figure 1 system transmitter; Figure 3 shows an operating block diagram of the 
Figure 1 system receiver; Figure 4 shows a time graph of the signal 
generated by the Figure 2 transmitter. Number 1 in Figure 1 indicates an actuator remote 
control system wherein a transmitter 3 supplies a 
control signal S to a receiver 5 connected to a number 
of actuators 6 (shown schematically) and to an alarm  
 
system 7, in particular the alarm system of a vehicle 
(not shown). Actuators 6 may comprise, for example, actuators 
for locking/unlocking the vehicle doors, luggage 
compartment door, fuel filler cover, etc. Transmitter 3 is housed in a small portable casing 
(not shown), and comprises a microprocessor 10 and a 
supply source 9 connected to
