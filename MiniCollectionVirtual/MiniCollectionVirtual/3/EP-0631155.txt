<ABSTRACT>
A prism assembly, particularly for use in deflecting the sightline of an imaging 
device, comprises four prisms each having a pair of orthogonal side faces (ABED, 

ACFD) meeting at a roof edge (AD). The prisms are clustered together with the roof 
edges (AD) lying parallel and adjacent to each other. Each prism further includes a 

pair of end faces (ABC, DEF) through which light rays can enter and exit the 
respective prism. The angles α, β between the roof edge (AD) of each prism and 

each of the adjacent edges (AB, ED, AC, FD) of each of the respective prisms end 
faces (ABC, DEF) are less than 90°.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a prism assembly, and in particular to a prism 
assembly for use in steering the sightline of an imaging device. There is a need for apparatus which can be mounted inline with a TV camera, 
for example, and which can be moved so as to enable the camera to view a large 
area. The need for such apparatus arises particularly with under aircraft pods where, 
for aerodynamic reasons, it is desirable to keep the cross section of the pod as small 
as possible It has been proposed to use a plane mirror located in front of the camera 
which is rotatable about a pair of orthogonal axes. Such an arrangement can have 
an unrestricted field of regard in azimuth, but in elevation the angle is usually limited 
by the mirror size and is typically less than ± 50°. Furthermore using such a mirror 
it is difficult to see straight ahead unless additional fold mirrors are used, which reduce 
compactness. Another arrangement which has been proposed comprises a pair of so-called 
Risley prisms which are essentially axially aligned wedge shaped prisms each having 
a face formed at an oblique angle. Such an arrangement suffers from distortion which 
increases with sightline deviation. The field of regard is accordingly limited by 
distortion to about 60° off axis in any direction. Furthermore, sightline deviation is a 
highly non-linear function of prism movement which complicates the movement control 
mechanism. This invention provides a prism assembly comprising four prisms each having  
 
a pair of orthogonal side faces meeting at a roof edge, the prisms being clustered 
together with the roof edges lying parallel and adjacent to each other, each prism 
further having an end face through which light rays enter the respective prism before 
reflecting from each of the orthogonal side faces and exiting from a further end face 
of the respective prism, the angles between the roof edge of each prism and each of 
the adjacent edges of each of the respective prisms end faces being less than 90°. By way of contrast to the above mentioned systems a prism assembly 
according to the invention can provide a full hemi-spherical field of regard - i.e. at least 
± 90° in both azimuth and elevation. Furthermore, with a reduced ratio of usable 
beam size to prism assembly size, the invention can provide a complete spherical 
field. In order that the invention may be better understood an embodiment thereof will 
now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying 
diagrammatic drawings in which;
