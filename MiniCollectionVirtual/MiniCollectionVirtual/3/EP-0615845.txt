<ABSTRACT>
A page wide ink jet printhead body (12) is formed using 
first and second series of identically configured 

rectangular piezoceramic blocks (18-24) having widths not greater 
than about one inch. The individual blocks are poled in 

widthwise directions and secured to one another and to an 
upper side surface of a non-poled piezoceramic lower body 

section in an orientation in which a first series of the 
blocks extend along the body section surface in a 

side-by-side orientation, a second series of the blocks 
extends along the upper side surface of the first block 

series, and the spaced side junctures of the first block 
series are aligned with the spaced side junctures of the 

second block series. Horizontally equally spaced saw cuts 
are then made downwardly through the first and second block 

series, with the block width being an even multiple of the 
horizontal saw cut pitch, and saw cuts extending vertically 

through the aligned side junctures of each block series. 
A top, non-poled piezoceramic body section is then secured 

to the top side of the second block series, the saw cuts 
forming within the resulting printhead body (12) a spaced series 

of parallel ink receiving channels interdigitated with a 
spaced series of piezoelectrically deflectable sidewall 

actuator sections. A suitable discharge orifice plate (14) is 
then secured to the body, over the front ends of the 

channels, and the rear ends of the channels are 
appropriately sealed off.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to ink jet 
printing apparatus, and more particularly relates to 
the fabrication of piezoelectrically operable ink jet 
printhead assemblies. A piezoelectrically actuated ink jet printhead is a 
device used to selectively eject tiny ink droplets onto 
a print medium sheet operatively fed through a printer, 
in which the printhead is incorporated, to thereby form 
from the ejected ink droplets selected text and/or 
graphics on the sheet. In one representative 
configuration thereof, an ink jet printhead has a 
horizontally spaced parallel array of internal ink-receiving 
channels. These internal channels are  
 
covered at their front ends by a plate member through 
which a spaced series of small ink discharge orifices 
are formed. Each channel opens outwardly through a 
different one of the spaced orifices. A spaced series of internal piezoelectric wall 
portions of the printhead body separate and laterally 
bound the channels along their lengths. To eject an 
ink droplet through a selected one of the discharge 
orifices, the two printhead sidewall portions that 
laterally bound the channel associated with the 
selected orifice are piezoelectrically deflected into 
the channel and then returned to their normal 
undeflected positions. The driven inward deflection of 
the opposite channel wall portions increases the 
pressure of the ink within the channel sufficiently to 
force a small quantity of ink, in droplet form, 
outwardly through the discharge orifice. Under previous methods of constructing 
piezoelectric ink jet printheads the printhead body 
section in which the channels are to be formed is first 
poled, to make it piezoelectrically deflectable or 
"active", by imposing a predetermined voltage widthwise 
across the body section in a selected poling direction 
parallel to the desired piezoelectric deflection 
direction of the internal sidewall sections to be later 
created in the poled body section by forming a spaced 
series of parallel grooves therein. These grooves may 
be formed using a sawing, laser cutting or etching 
process. A typical material used in the formation of 
piezoelectric ink jet printhead bodies is a 
piezoceramic material- commonly referred to as "PZT." 
The proper poling of PZT requires voltages on the order  
 
of 1.18·103 to 2.9·103 volts per mm (30 to 75 volts per mil). 
Accordingly, the widthwise poling of a 25.4mm (one inch) 
wide printhead body section formed from PZT requires a 
poling voltage within the range of from about

A method of fabricating a page wide piezoelectric ink 
jet printhead (16), said method comprising the steps of: 


providing a first series (20) of piezoelectric body
