<ABSTRACT>
In a sheet fed inkjet printer (100) in which liquid ink is applied to a sheet of print 
medium in a succession of horizontal swaths, throughput is increased by a throughput 

enhancement means (129) which changes an actual throughput rate determined by 
the sum of (a) a first elapsed time between the initial positioning of the print head 

adjacent a top portion of the sheet before the first horizontal swath has been printed 
and the final positioning of the print head at a bottom portion of the sheet after the last 

horizontal swath has been printed and (b) a sheet feeding delay equal to a second 
elapsed time between the final positioning of one sheet and the initial positioning of a 

next sheet. The printer has a densitometer means (128) responsive the respective 
locations of the dots for locating a densely printed area of said one sheet and a 

stacking means (121) for stacking successive said sheets after they have been 

printed. The printer also has an anti-smear means (130) responsive to the 
densitometer means for causing the throughput means to maintain the actual 

throughout rate below a value where a next sheet is likely to come into contact with a 
densely printed area of a preceding sheet in the stacking means before the ink in said 

densely printed area of said preceding sheet has dried to a point where it is not 
subject to being smeared by such contact with said next sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to inkjet printers and in
particular to printing high quality images having densely inked areas without
smearing the print media.Inkjet printers operate by sweeping a pen with one or more inkjet
nozzles above a print medium and applying a precision quantity of liquid ink
from specified nozzles as they pass over specified pixel locations on the
print medium.The print medium becomes damper and remains damp for a longer
time as more ink is applied on the same area of the print medium. As a first 
approximation, the drying time, before which the ink is not subject to smearing by
contact with an adjacent sheet, is a linear function of amount of ink applied.
In certain prior art inkjet printers, a fixed delay is introduced between any
physical contact between successively printed sheets, which is greater than
the maximum time required to dry the densest possible image to the point
that it is not susceptible to smearing. However, this unnecessarily restricts
throughput when the printed images on some pages do not contain any
densely inked portions and/or when large unprinted areas appear on
succeeding pages which can be completely bypassed by the print head.Thus, the prior art has failed to provide a satisfactory solution for
printing a high quality graphics image at a high throughput rate, which is
further exacerbated if additional dots of ink are selectively applied between
adjacent pixels, thereby effectively doubling the number of dots of ink, in
order to increase image density and/or to provide smoother boundaries for
any curved or diagonal images ("Resolution Enhancement Technology").EP-A-0 423 820 describes an ink jet printer having a sheet conveying mechanism
which changes the speed of conveyance of a printed sheet through a drying area in
accordance with the density of characters or pattern just printed. Therefore, an overall objective of the present invention is to provide
an improved inkjet printer,
as specified in the claims hereinafter,
whereby a page of high density graphics images
can be printed without smearing by contact with a second page, without
any unnecessary reduction of throughput.In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, throughput
enhancement logic is inhibited during the printing of the second page for a
variable delay related to the image density of the first page. In accordance
with specific aspects of the invention, the variable delay is calculated as a
linear function of both the density (relative to a predetermined grid

<CLAIMS>
A sheet fed inkjet printer (100) in which liquid ink
is applied to at least first and second sheets of print

medium (101) in a succession of horizontal swaths
relative to top and bottom portions of each sheet,

comprising:

a print head having a plurality of print nozzles
(103) arranged in a vertical array relative to the top

and bottom portions of each sheet;
sheet feeding means (121) for advancing each of the
sheets past said print head in a vertical direction

relative to the top and bottom portions of each sheet;
carriage means (122) for traversing said print head
horizontally across successive said horizontal swaths of

each of the sheets at portions of each sheet respectively
vertically-displaced relative to the top and bottom of

each sheet;
print means (123) for printing an image on each of
the sheets by selectively applying dots of said ink to

each sheet through selected ones of said nozzles as said
print head is traversed by said carriage means;
throughput enhancement means (129) for varying an
actual throughput rate determined by the sum of (a) a

variable intra-sheet printing delay equal to a first
elapsed time between the initial positioning of the print

head adjacent a top portion of a sheet before the first
horizontal swath has been printed and the final

positioning of the print head at a bottom portion of the
sheet after the last horizontal swath has been printed

and (b) an inter-sheet feeding delay equal to a second
elapsed time between the final positioning of the print

head at the bottom portion of the first sheet and the
initial positioning of the print head at the top portion

of the second sheet;
densitometer means (128) responsive to the 
respective locations of the dots for determining the

density of a densely printed area of the first sheet;
stacking means (121) for stacking the second sheet
onto the first sheet as the second sheet is being

printed; and
anti-smear means (130) responsive to the output from
the densitometer means for selectively inhibiting the

throughput enhancement means from decreasing the variable
intra-sheet printing delay during the printing of the

second sheet such that the second sheet is prevented from
coming into contact with the densely printed area of the

first sheet in the stacking means before the ink in said
densely printed area of the first sheet has dried to a

point where it is not subject to being smeared by contact
with the second sheet.
A printer according to claim 1, wherein said
densitometer means is responsive to said print means.
A printer according to claim 2, wherein said print
means determines which pixels in a predetermined grid

receive said dots of ink and said densitometer means
counts the number of said dots in each said grid.
A printer according to claim 3, wherein said
predetermined grid has substantially fewer rows and

columns of pixels than are present in a single column of
pixels in each of said horizontal swaths.
A printer according to claim 3, wherein said
predetermined grid overlaps at least half of a

horizontally adjacent grid and at least half of a
vertically adjacent grid.
A printer according to claim 1, wherein said
throughput enhancement means searches for unprinted areas

of each of said horizontal swaths.
A printer according to claim 6, wherein said
throughput enhancement means searches for horizontal

swaths having both printed and unprinted areas and causes 
the print head to traverse at least one of said unprinted

areas at a higher rate.
A printer according to claim 6, wherein said
throughput means searches for horizontal swaths having

only unprinted areas, and causes
successive such unprinted

swaths to be advanced continuously past the print head.
A printer according to claim 6, wherein said
throughput means reduces the number and/or size of said

horizontal swaths that are traversed by the print head.
A printer according to claim 6 wherein the anti-smear
means determines a required delay which must elapse

after the printing of the first sheet before the carriage
means is enabled by the throughput enhancement means

either to traverse across such unprinted areas on the
second sheet at a higher rate, or to not traverse across

such unprinted areas, said required delay being dependent
on at least on the density and location of said densely

printed portion of the first sheet.
