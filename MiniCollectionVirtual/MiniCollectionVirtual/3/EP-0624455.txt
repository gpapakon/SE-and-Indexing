<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to synthetic plastic sheeting which is in the 
form of a flexible 

synthetic plastic film of material which has a biocide incorporated 
therein. The biocide 

can serve to inhibit the growth of different micro-organisms that cause 
bio-deterioration 

and, as such, the film can be used for packaging of or the covering, or 
protection of, 

products and objects that are exposed to bio-deterioration. The sheeting can also be 
provided in a sleeve form (12) permitting fitting on timber poles, for 

covering regions of 
poles to be disposed underground, in use, thereby protecting these regions against 

bio-deterioration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a synthetic plastic sleeve formed of
a synthetic plastic sheeting.Synthetic plastic sheeting has a wide application within the packaging industry, as
well as in various other industries and applications, where it is used for covering
and/or protecting different articles, objects, and other subject matter. Many of the
applications of synthetic plastic sheeting are associated with subject matter that is
exposed to bio-deterioration as a result of the growth of different micro-organisms
and where the subject matter has to be treated with or exposed to, for example,
biocides, in order to inhibit the growth of micro-organisms. Many different
biocides are known for the purpose, biocides being provided in the form of liquids,
pastes, powders, solids, and other forms, in order to facilitate the treatment of
subject matter and/or the exposure of subject matter thereto.When subject matter that is exposed to bio-deterioration is required to be
packaged within, covered by, or protected by synthetic plastic sheeting, the
treatment with or exposure to suitable biocides constitute separate and time
consuming operations. As such, it is an object of this invention to at least alleviate 
this problem and to provide for required biocide treatment an/or biocide exposure
to be facilitated.According to the invention there is provided
a synthetic plastic sleeve formed of a synthetic plastic sheeting which
comprises a liquid impervious, non-biodegradable flexible synthetic plastic
film of material which has a dry-film biocide for inhibiting the growth of
microorganisms that cause bio-deterioration incorporated therein the sleeve
being dimensioned to fit onto a predetermined diameter timber pole for
covering a desired area thereof and having shrinkage properties to permit
secure location of the sleeve on the timber pole by being shrunk onto the
pole through heating.The product of this invention is thus provided in the form of a
liquid impervious, non bio-degradable elongated sleeve that can be fitted onto a
timber pole to be supported in the ground for covering a desired area of the pole,
i.e. the area of the pole that is exposed to sub-soil decay caused by a range of
common and widespread fungi which inhabit the ground.Elongated sleeves provided for the purpose may have predetermined dimensions
and shrinkage properties, permitting the sleeves to be fitted onto poles having
predetermined diameters and to be securely located by being shrunk onto the
poles by heating. The synthetic plastic film forming

being dimensioned to fit onto a predetermined diameter timber pole for
covering a desired area thereof and having shrinkage properties to permit

secure location of the sleeve on the timber pole by being shrunk onto the
pole through heating.
A synthetic plastic sleeve as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the
synthetic plastic film having the dry-film biocide incorporated therein is an

extruded film having the dry-film biocide incorporated into the plastic
material of which the film is formed, prior to the extrusion thereof.
A synthetic plastic sleeve as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the
synthetic plastic material of which the film is formed is provided in granular

form and the dry-film biocide is incorporated therein in a powder form prior
to the extrusion of the synthetic plastic film.
A synthetic plastic sleeve as claimed in Claim 2, characterized in that the
synthetic plastic material of which the film is formed is provided in granular

form and the dry-film biocide is incorporated therein in liquid form prior to
the extrusion of the synthetic plastic film. 
A synthetic plastic sleeve as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the synthetic plastic material of which the film forming

the sleeve is formed is of one of low density polyethylene, linear low
density polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and cross-linked polyethylene.
A synthetic plastic sleeve as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that the dry-film biocide incorporated in the material of the

synthetic plastic film forming the sleeve includes urea derivatives,
isothiazolinone and glycols.
