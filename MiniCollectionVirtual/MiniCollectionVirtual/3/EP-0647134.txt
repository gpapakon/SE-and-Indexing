 METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR TREATING DEPRESSION AND OTHER DISORDERS USING OPTICALLY PURE (-) SIBUTRAMINE1. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to novel compositions of matter containing optically pure (-) sibutramine. These compositions possess potent activity in treating depression. These compositions also possess potent activity in treating depression while avoiding the adverse effects, including but not limited to, significant increases in heart rate, increased blood pressure, psychomotor activity, dry mouth, and nervousness which are associated with the administration of the racemic mixture of sibutramine. The novel compositions of the present invention avoid said adverse effects while exhibiting a more rapid onset of action than that exhibited by racemic sibutramine. Additionally, these novel compositions of matter containing optically pure (-) sibutramine are useful in treating obesity or weight gain in a human. These compositions also possess potent activity in treating obesity and weight gain while avoiding the adverse effects which are associated with the administration of the racemic mixture of sibutramine.In addition, these novel compositions of matter containing (-) sibutramine are useful in treating disorders ameliorated by inhibition of neuronal monoamine reuptake, because (-) sibutramine acts as a neuronal monoamine reuptake inhibitor. Several monoamines, the reuptake of which are inhibited by sibutramine include, but are not limited to, dopamine, noradrenaline (also known as norepinephrine) , and serotonin. (King et al . J. Clin 

Pharmac . 26.'- 607-611, 1989; Rees, United States Patent No. 4,871,774). Disorders ameliorated by neuronal monoamine reuptake inhibition include, but are not limited to, Parkinson's disease and depression. The novel compositions of the present invention also possess potent activity in treating disorders ameliorated by neuronal monoamine reuptake inhibition while avoiding the adverse effects associated with the administration of racemic sibutramine. Furthermore, these novel compositions of matter containing optically pure or substantially optically pure (-) sibutramine are useful in treating cerebral function disorders. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, senile dementia, Alzheimer's type dementia, memory loss, amnesia/amnestic syndrome, disturbance of consciousness, coma, lowering of attention, speech disorders, Parkinson's disease, Lennox syndrome, autism, hyperkinetic syndrome and schizophrenia. Cerebral function disorders may be
