<ABSTRACT>
An electrically balanced wiring device (100) comprises 
first and second rows (110 and 112) of connector blocks 

(108) including beam contacts for transmission lines. A row 
(116) of connecting strips (114) is located between the 

first and second rows (110 and 112) of connector blocks 
(108). The connecting strips (114) include a first and 

second set of contacts co-operating to define defeatable 
electrical connections in said connecting strips. The 

connector blocks (108) and connecting strips (114) are 
mounted on a circuit board (106). A circuitry on the 

circuit board (106) connects the contacts of the connector 
blocks in the first row (110) to the contacts of the first 

set in the connecting strips (114) and the contacts of the 
connector blocks in the second row (112) to the contacts of 

the second set in the connecting strips (114). The 
circuitry on the circuit board (106) is configured so as to 

substantially restore electrical balance to the 
transmission lines wherein cross talk originating from said 

first and second connector means is reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wiring blocks for use 
primarily in the communications industry. More 
specifically, this invention relates to a wiring device 
with break test capability. Communication system and/or network efficiency is 
directly dependent upon the integrity of the connector 
scheme employed. Such connector schemes include, for 
example, standard interfaces for equipment/user access 
(outlet connector), transmission means (horizontal and 
backbone cabling), and administration/distribution points 
(cross-connect and patching facilities). Regardless of the 
type of capabilities of the transmission media used for an 
installation, the integrity of the wiring infrastructure is 
only as good as the performance of the individual 
components that bind it together. By way of example, a non-standard connector or pair 
scheme may require that work area outlets be rewired to 
accommodate a group move, system change, or an installation 
with connecting hardware whose installed transmission 
characteristics are compatible with an existing application 
but are later found to have inadequate performance when the 
system is expanded or upgraded to higher transmission 
rates. Accordingly, connecting hardware without properly 
qualified design and transmission capabilities, can drain 
user productivity, compromise system performance and pose a 
significant barrier to new and emerging applications. Reliability, connection integrity and durability are 
also important considerations, since wiring life cycles 
typically span periods of ten or twenty years. In order to 
properly address specifications for, and performance of 
telecommunications connecting hardware, it is preferred to 
establish a meaningful and accessible point of reference. 
The primary reference, considered by many to be the 
international benchmark for commercially based  
 
telecommunications components and installations, is 
standard ANSI/EIA/TIA-568 (TIA-568) Commercial Building 
Telecommunications Wiring Standard. A supplement Technical 
Systems Bulletin to TIA-568 is TIA/EIA TSB40 (TSB40), 
Additional Transmission Specifications for Unshielded 
Twisted-Pair Connecting Hardware. Among the many aspects of 
telecommunications cabling covered by these standards are 
connecting hardware design, reliability and transmission 
performance. Accordingly, the industry has established a 
common set of test methods and pass/fail criteria on which 
performance claims and comparative data may be based. To determine connecting hardware performance in a
