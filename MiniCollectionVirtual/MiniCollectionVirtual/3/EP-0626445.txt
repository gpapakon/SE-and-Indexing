<ABSTRACT>
Enzyme for inclusion in liquid detergent concentrates 
is provided as a stable dispersion of small particles that 

also include a protective polymeric material which may be 
matrix polymer, a coacervate shell, either of which may be 

present together with a film of polymeric dispersion 
stabiliser, or a film of dispersion stabilizer alone.

<DESCRIPTION>
It is well known to include enzymes in detergent 
compositions in order to improve their performance. The 
enzymes will be de-activated by exposure to other 
chemical components in the detergent, and possibly also 
upon exposure to moisture. It is therefore necessary to 
protect the enzyme, for instance by encapsulation within 
a polymer. Detergent powders therefore frequently 
contain powdered enzyme-polymer compositions. A difficulty that exists with liquid detergents is 
that the liquid phase of the detergent concentrate is 
more likely to attack the encapsulating polymer and does, 
in any event, tend to provide a more rigorous chemical 
and physical environment from which the polymer has to 
protect the enzyme. It has proved difficult to provide 
the enzyme in a protected form and that is stably 
distributed within the liquid detergent. If the enzyme 
is not fully protected then the enzyme activity in the 
detergent, when it is used by the consumer, will be very 
low. In GB 2,186,884 it is proposed to disperse the 
enzyme in a silicone oil and to disperse this dispersion 
in the liquid detergent. Although it is proposed that 
the dispersed particles can have a size as low as 2µm in 
practice they are always very much larger than this. 
This has to follow from the fact that the enzyme, that is 
within the dispersed particles, is stated to have a 
particle size that is preferably above 5µm, with the 
result that the dispersed particles containing the enzyme 
must inevitably be much larger. In practice therefore 
at least 90% of the particles of oil and enzyme will 
always have a particle size substantially above 5µm. In JP-A-63-105098 it is proposed to microencapsulate 
enzyme in polyvinyl alcohol and to disperse the resultant  
 
microcapsules in a liquid or gel detergent. In practice 
any liquid detergents that are used would need to have a 
high viscosity because the microcapsules that are made 
are always relatively large, for instance 150 to 800µm in 
example 1 and so would inevitably settle out from a 
conventional, relatively low viscosity, liquid detergent 
concentrate. One way that is described for making the 
microcapsules involves dispersing an enzyme solution 
containing polyhydroxy compound and polyvinyl alcohol is 
dispersed in hydrophobic solvent as microdroplets and the 
water content is removed by heating or decrease in 
pressure. As mentioned, the particle size is large and 
this process is not exemplified. The commercial reality is that there is no entirely 
satisfactory way of

<CLAIMS>
A liquid composition comprising a substantially stable 
dispersion in a liquid phase of particles which have a size 

below 20 µm and which comprise a detergent enzyme and 
protective polymeric material which is impermeable to 

liquid detergent concentrates but which releases the enzyme 
when agitated in aqueous wash liquor and which consists of 

any one of 

(a) a matrix polymer through which the enzyme is 
distributed, optionally together with an outer shell which 

is a film of polymeric dispersion stabiliser 
(b) an outer shell which is a film of polymeric 
dispersion stabiliser, and 
(c) an outer shell of coacervated polymeric material, 
optionally together with an inner film of polymeric 

dispersion stabiliser and in both cases (a) and (b) the 
particles have been made by a process comprising forming a 

dispersion of an aqueous phase in a water immiscible liquid 
in the presence of polymeric dispersion stabiliser wherein 

the aqueous phase contains the enzyme and azeotroping the 
dispersion.

protective polymeric material is (a) and in which the 

matrix polymer is an addition polymer of ethylenically 
unsaturated ionic monomer optionally with ethylenically 

unsaturated non-ionic monomer. 
A composition according to claim 1 or claim 2 in which 
the protective polymeric material is 


(a) a matrix polymer through which the enzyme is

which the protective polymeric material is (b). 
A composition according to claim 3 or claim 4 in which 
the stabiliser is an amphipathic polymeric stabiliser. 
A composition according to claim 2 or claim 3 in which 
the matrix polymer has been formed by including the polymer 

as a solution or emulsion in the dispersed aqueous phase. 
A composition according to claim 6 in which the matrix 
polymer has been chemically modified during or after the 

azeotroping to render it less permeable to liquid detergent 
concentrate. 
A composition according to claim 1 in which the 
protective polymeric material is (c). 
A composition according to any of claims 1 to 5 or 8 
in which the particles have a size below 3 µm. 
A composition according to any of claims 1 to 5 or 9 

or 10 in which the liquid phase is a liquid detergent.
