<ABSTRACT>
In a telecommunications system in which narrowband or guiding services already exist, 
different service rates, either fixed or variable may be required. A further service switch is 

connected in parallel with the existing narrowband or guiding switch, the further service switch 
being similarly controlled in response to the guiding signalling.

<DESCRIPTION>
Dial-up telecommunication services have been principally concerned with providing circuits between subscribers that are capable of carrying speech, with non-speech traffic being adapted so that it can be carried by the speech circuits. The many signalling protocols, call control and billing methods for the Public Switched Telephony Network (PSTN) have been evolved over many years and now offer a very considerable range of features and facilities. Some other dial-up networks have also been introduced, such as Telex and Packet Switching, which each have their own signalling protocols, call control and billing methods, which give their own features and facilities.In DE-A-4225203, Siemens disclose a digital communications network designed to avoid traffic overload. In particular; a signalling path is used to establish whether a destination subscriber is busy or available. Only if it is established via the signalling path that the destination subscriber is available, is an attempt made to set up a data path through the network.As new dial up services are proposed, either new signalling protocols, call control and billing methods must be introduced, or the existing ones re-used. The object of the present invention is to maximise the opportunity to re-use the existing PSTN signalling, call control and billing methods, thereby greatly reducing the development cycle as well as making it unnecessary to wait for new signalling protocols to be agreed by the standards organisations.The underlying architecture of what is herein termed "harmonic switching" is suitable for controlling the many new proposed dial-up services, an example of which is Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM).According to the present invention there is provided a telecommunications switching system having a first guiding transmission path and a second guided harmonic transmission path whereby harmonic means to providing data of two or more service rates; comprising: an originating subscriber's guiding terminal; an originating subscriber's harmonic terminal; a terminating subscriber's guiding terminal and a terminating subscriber's harmonic terminal; an originating guiding access point on an exchange where the originating subscriber's guiding terminal is connected, the terminal having both supervisory and signalling means; an originating harmonic access point on an exchange where the originating subscriber's harmonic terminal is connected; a terminating guiding access point on an exchange where the terminating subscriber's guiding terminal is
