<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
forming novel Si-O containing coatings. The method 
comprises converting hydrogen silsesquioxane resin into Si-O 
containing ceramic coatings in the presence of hydrogen gas. The use of silica-containing ceramic coatings 
derived from hydrogen silsesquioxane resin on electronic 
devices is known in the art. For instance, U.S. Patent 
No. 4,756,977 describes processes for forming coatings on 
electronic devices which comprise diluting hydrogen 
silsesquioxane in solvents, applying the solutions to 
substrates, evaporating the solvents and heating the coated 
substrates to a temperature of 150 to 1000°C. in air. The conversion of hydrogen silsesquioxane resin to 
a Si-O containing ceramic in other environments is also 
known in the art. For instance, European Patent Application 
No. 90311008.8 teaches the conversion of hydrogen 
silsesquioxane resin to a Si-O containing ceramic by heating 
a substrate coated with the resin in an inert gas 
atmosphere. The present inventors have now found that hydrogen 
silsesquioxane resin can be converted into Si-O containing 
ceramic coatings of improved properties by heating in an 
environment containing hydrogen gas. The present invention introduces a method of 
forming a novel Si-O containing ceramic coating on an 
electronic substrate. The method comprises first applying a 
coating comprising hydrogen silsesquioxane resin on the 
substrate. The coated substrate is then heated in an 
atmosphere containing hydrogen gas at a temperature  
 
sufficient to convert the hydrogen silsesquioxane resin 
coating to a Si-O containing ceramic coating. The present invention is based on our finding that 
heating hydrogen silsesquioxane resin in an atmosphere 
comprising hydrogen gas converts the resin to an Si-O 
containing ceramic coating with properties superior to those 
achieved by heating the resin in conventional gaseous 
atmospheres. For instance, the use of hydrogen can lower 
the dielectric constant of the resultant ceramic coating and 
render it stable. Moreover, such treatment may also 
advantageously affect the physical properties of the coating 
(e.g., stress, cracking, etc.). Because of these effects, the coatings resulting 
from this invention are particularly valuable on electronic 
substrates. Such coatings serve, for example, as protective 
coatings, interlevel dielectric layers, doped dielectric 
layers to produce transistor like devices, pigment loaded 
binder systems containing silicon to produce capacitor and 
capa
