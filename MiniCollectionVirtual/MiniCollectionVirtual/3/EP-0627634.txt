<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle obstruction detection system (15) 
for discriminating between hazardous and non-hazardous 

obstructions (13) within a predetermined zone uses a 
pair of frequency modulated continuous wave radar 

cycles (FM-CW) and a single continuous wave radar 
cycle (CW) in the generation of radar quantities for 

measuring obstruction range and apparent obstruction 
velocity. Measured quantities from the FM-CW and CW 

cycles are compared with predetermined quantities for 
discriminating between hazardous and non-hazardous 

obstructions (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a vehicle
obstruction detection system and to a method of
discriminating between hazardous and non-hazardous
obstructions, for example for discriminating hazardous
objects from various non-hazardous objects and/or
clutter commonly encountered in typical automotive
environments.Many attempts have been made to provide
reliable discrimination of obstructions in the path of
a vehicle. Many of these attempts have used vehicular
radar systems which provide data relating to the range
of the obstruction and relative velocity between the
obstruction and the vehicle. The operating
environment of an automotive radar system presents
many challenges to the system designer, among the most
troublesome being differentiation between hazardous
and non-hazardous obstructions, both of which return
transmitted radar signals. Typical non-hazardous
obstructions include road signs, bridges, fences,
guardrails and the like. Poor discrimination of such
non-hazards from hazards limits the effectiveness and
reliability of such automotive radar systems.Various attempts have been made to remedy
the above shortfalls. One such attempt includes
limiting the range and pattern width of signal
transmission and reception, however, this also
undesirably limits the area of detection. This is an
especially unattractive option where, as in a vehicle
blind-zone detection radar system, a relatively wide
area needs to be covered.Other proposals for solving the above
shortfalls include multiple transmitter and/or
receiver configurations which are complex and costly.Systems with variable transmitted radar
pattern angle and range, responsive to steering input, 
have also been proposed to limit return signals from
non-hazard obstructions of the type which are
tangential to a vehicle's travel around a curve or
bend. This technique may be useful for look-ahead or
look-back radar systems where radar pattern is
substantially aligned with the major axis of the
vehicle but does not address the problems of
blind-zone radar systems where the transmission
pattern is intentionally at an angle from the major
axis of the vehicle.Additionally, relatively complicated return
signal processing to separate multipath signals in
frequency bands have been proposed to discriminate
between several detected obstructions.
FR-A-2255610 discloses a detection system in accordance with the
preamble of Claims 1 and 2.The present invention seeks to provide an
improved vehicle obstruction detection system and a
method of discriminating between
