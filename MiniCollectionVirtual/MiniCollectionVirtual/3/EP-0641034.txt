<ABSTRACT>
To reduce crosstalk in reentrant off-chip RF selectivity, differential 
circuits (402, 415), transmission lines (423, 424), and off-chip filters (422) 

are used in a structure that balances the parasitic capacitances 
associated with all of the differential elements. The structure includes a 

substrate (409) with a differential generating circuit (402) and a receiving 
circuit (415). Two differential transmission lines (423, 424), each with 

constant characteristic impedance, and each with balanced capacitance 
to ground, both being closely spaced for some distance, couple the 

circuits (402, 415) to closely spaced terminating pads (403). A ground 
plane (412) is shared under both transmission lines (423, 424). A second 

substrate (408) having a reentrant RF path (406) with the first substrate 
409) contains an RF function such as a filter or a delay line.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the following U.S. patents:
US-A-5397862 by David E. Bockelman and Douglas H.
Weisman, entitled "A Horizontally Twisted-Pair Planar Conductor Line
Structure," to US-A-5389735 by David E. Bockelman,
entitled "A Vertically Twisted-Pair Conductor Line Structure," to
US-A-5430247 by David E. Bockelman, entitled "A
Twisted-Pair Planar Conductor Line Off-Set Structure," and to
US-A-5459284 by David E. Bockelman and Douglas H. Weisman,
entitled "A Twisted-Pair Wire Bond and Method Thereof," all filed
concurrently herewith and all assigned to Motorola, Inc.This invention relates to miniaturized high frequency circuits and
more particularly to the interconnection of these circuits.Referring to FIG. 1, in a multi-substrate radio frequency (RF)
structure, an RF signal is routed off of one substrate 100 onto another
substrate 200 and then back onto the first substrate 100. For example, in
a radio transceiver, the active RF functions, such as amplifying in a
generating circuit 102 and mixing in a receiving circuit 103, are
fabricated on one semiconductor substrate 100 and a passive band-pass
filter 101 having a certain delay is fabricated on the other substrate 200.
In this case, the main RF signal passes off of the first substrate 100, is
filtered or otherwise simply processed on the second substrate 200, and
returns to the first substrate 100 for further processing.This routing of the RF signal of FIG. 1 and its subsequent
selectivity performance, as seen in FIG. 12, will henceforth be defined as
"reentrant off-chip RF selectivity". RF selectivity is the characteristic
which determines the extent to which the desired signal can be
differentiated from the disturbances of other frequencies or out-of-band
signals. In other words, selectivity is related to the amount of
attenuation of out-of-band signals.Generally, the active RF portion of a radio front-end of the
transceiver is fabricated on a semiconductor substrate that is physically 
small relative to the off-chip or second substrate. This small size of the
active or first substrate requires any electrical connections to be closely
spaced on the semiconductor substrate. Henceforth, "closely spaced
electrical connections" are defined as electrical connections which have
connection areas that are spaced distally on the same order as their side
length.In prior art reentrant off-chip schemes, poor RF selectivity
performance has resulted due to the cross-talk coupling or jumping of
the RF signal from the input to the output of the filter
