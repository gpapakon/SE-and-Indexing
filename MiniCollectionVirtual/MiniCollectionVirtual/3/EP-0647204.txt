<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of and a device for 
suction transporting. More particularly, it relates to a 
transporting method and device which use a suction force for 
transporting solid and liquid particles by a carrying agent. Suction transporting methods and devices are known in the 
art. In known methods and devices air and water from the 
environment are normally used as carrying agents. One example 
of this is a dry-wet vacuum cleaner in which air is used as 
a carrying agent for transporting solid and liquid particles. 
Another example is a suction dredge which uses water as a 
carrying agent for transporting solid particles. A known 
transporting method and device usually utilizes a source of 
suction, for example a fan driven by an electric motor, and 
a transporting line formed as a hollow elongated body. A 
suction nozzle can be attached to the front end of the transporting 
line and adapted to take in the carrying agent with 
the material to be transported. The efficiency of the transportation 
is determined here primarily by a magnitude of a 
suction force which is developed at the surface from which 
the material is taken in by the suction nozzle. The strongest 
suction force in a particular suction-method and device is 
obtained when the edge of the suction nozzle has a good 
contact with the surface. However, due to a strong suction 
force developed by such a nozzle, it sticks to the surface 
and as a result it becomes very difficult and sometimes 
impossible to move the nozzle along the surface. Various means are used to reduce sticking and to achieve  
 
better mobility of a suction nozzle. For example, special cuts 
are made in the edges of the nozzle, or the nozzle is kept 
elevated above the surface. When the cutting or elevating of 
the suction nozzle is not desirable, an adjustable slot with 
a valve body is made in the wall of the transporting line as 
disclosed, for example, in US-A-3,048,876. The above 
means increases the mobility of the suction nozzle, but at the 
same time, permanently reduces the suction force at the surface 
where the material is being taken, and therefore permanently 
decreases the efficiency of the suction transporting.  
 
Another known device having an opening 
in the transporting line which is manually 
adjustable in size to regulate the flow of air 
at a suction nozzle is disclosed in US-A-2176139.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a method 
of and a device for suction transporting, in which sticking of 
a suction nozzle to

A method of suction transporting, comprising the 
steps of applying a suction to a transporting line (1,2) by 

suction means (4) so that a material is transported through 
the transporting line (1,2) from its inlet to its outlet; and 

modulating a suction force of the suction produced in the 
transporting line (1,2) by communicating the interior of the 

transporting line with atmosphere through a passage
