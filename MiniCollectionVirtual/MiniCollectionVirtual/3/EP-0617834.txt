<ABSTRACT>
A switch assembly comprising a housing including a baseplate on which are mounted a magnetic core having a pair of flanges and a winding wound around it, and two switch capsules positioned on either sides of the magnetic core with each capsule being insulated from each flange of the magnetic core by insulating means. Magnets are also positioned to provide either a monostable or a bistable mode of operation as desired. With this construction, the magnetic and electric paths in the assembly are physically separate from one another, thereby allowing the magnetic and electric materials to be chosen independently from each other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mercury wetted 
switch assembly according to the preamble of claim 1 which is capable of operation in any 
position. Such a mercury wetted switch assembly, as exemplified by DE-A-1173162, 
comprises a mercury wetted switch and an 
energizing coil to generate a magnetic field in the 
magnetic conducting parts in order to generate a 
magnetic force to operate the switch. Presently, a 
typical mercury wetted switch comprises a sealed glass 
capsule in which there is mounted a movable armature 
having a pair of pole ends for alternately contacting 
a respective electric contact when the armature is 
pivoting and the surface of the armature is wetted with 
a film of mercury. The switch is operated by the 
magnetic force generated in the magnetic conducting 
parts by the magnetic field produced by an energizing 
coil. The mode of operation, either monostable or 
bistable, is created by externally positioning one or 
two permanent magnets to the capsule. The reeds used in the capsule for making the switching 
contacts are to be made of a material that must be 
carefully chosen in order to meet three requirements : 
1) it must be optimally magnetic conducting,  
 2) it must be optimally electric conducting, 3) it must have an expansion coefficient that is compatible 
with the expansion coefficient of glass. In practice, the choice of the material for the reeds 
is a compromise between the said three requirements and 
can never optimally meet all and each of them. The object of this invention is to provide a mercury 
wetted switch construction in which the magnetic and 
electric paths are as much as possible separate from 
each other thereby allowing the magnetic and electric 
materials to be optimally chosen independently from one 
another. It is another object of this invention to provide a 
mercury wetted switch construction in which the 
magnetic and electric paths are as much as possible 
separate from each other thereby making it possible to 
achieve better magnetic and electrical characteristics. These objects are attained in accordance with the invention 
with a mercury wetted switch assembly as defined 
in claim 1. According to the invention, there is provided a mercury wetted 
switch assembly housed in a housing with terminals projecting 
from the housing and comprising a winding construction, characterised in that 
said winding 
construction includes a magnetic core mounted on a 
baseplate and having a pair of end flanges, and a 
winding wound directly around said

<CLAIMS>
A mercury-wetted switch assembly housed in a housing 
(16) with terminals (15) projecting from the housing (16) and comprising a winding construction, 

characterised in that 

said winding construction includes a magnetic core (11) 
mounted on a baseplate and having a pair of end flanges 

(12), and a winding (17) wound directly around said 
core (11), and in that the mercury-wetted switch 

assembly comprises 
a pair of mercury-wetted switch capsules (20) mounted 
on the baseplate with one capsule (20) being positioned on 

either side of the magnetic core (11), each capsule (20) being 
insulated from each of the flanges (12) of the magnetic core (11) 

by insulating means (13), 
at least one of said capsules (20) having at least one 
magnet (14) externally positioned to the capsule (20), and 

each of said capsules (20) having said terminals (15) connected 
directly to the capsule (20) and projecting from the housing 

(16), whereby said terminals (15) are physically independent 
from the winding construction. 
A mercury-wetted switch assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
each of the switch capsules (20) includes a ceramic plate (21) 

having a recess (22) formed therein for accommodation of a 
cantilever beam (23) mounted such that said beam (23) is capable 

of pivoting movement, said beam (23) having a pair of pole 
ends for alternately contacting a respective electric 

contact when the beam (23) is pivoting, a surface of said 
beam being wetted with a film of mercury. 
A mercury-wetted switch assembly as claimed in claim 2, wherein the 
cantilever beam (23) is provided with a lengthwise groove 

for allowing distribution of mercury to the switching 
areas.  

 
A mercury-wetted switch assembly as claimed in any of claims 1 to 
3, wherein the pole ends of the cantilever beam (23) are 

provided with mercury-wetted contact spots (27).
