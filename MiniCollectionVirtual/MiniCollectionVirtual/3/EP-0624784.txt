<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a density sensor (100) in which the density of a free-flowing medium is measured by means of oscillation techniques. The free-flowing medium flows through parts of the oscillating system which form limbs of a tuning fork. The tuning-fork limbs are formed by U-shaped tubes (16, 17) arranged opposite each other in parallel planes, which tubes are connected at the free ends of two limbs (22, 23) lying opposite each other parallel to the planes, by a tube bend (21) to form an endless double tube loop arrangement (20). Near the tube bend (21) a clamping element designed as an inertial body (26) is provided, in which the ends of the limbs of the U-shaped tubes (16, 17) are held and which forms the base of the tuning fork. The free ends of the U-shaped tubes (16, 17) are displaced using a vibrational drive (11, 32; 50', 51') in reciprocal flexural oscillation in a plane perpendicular to their plane. In order to determine the density of a free-flowing medium, the change in the natural frequency (eigenfrequency) when there is a flow through the tube is measured. By virtue of using an inertial body (26) for clamping the U-shaped tubes (16, 17), the oscillation has a particularly high quality, by means of which particularly high resolution of the measured values and stability of the measurement are achieved and the density sensor is particularly insensitive to external interference.
