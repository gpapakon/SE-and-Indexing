<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle seat (10) which carries a passenger restraint system, namely a lap belt (30) and a shoulder belt (28), with a tension load carrying member (64) being provided to resist forward rotation and bending of the backrest frame (14) during a frontal vehicle collision when the shoulder belt (28) is loaded in tension. The tension load carrying member (64) forms a truss structure with the frame back portion (42) and the frame base portion (36). However, during normal vehicle operation, the tension load carrying member (64) is detached from the frame back portion (42) eliminating the truss structure and the need for a more complex recliner mechanism for adjusting the position of the backrest (14). A grip mechanism (76, 80) is provided to attach the load carrying member (64) in response to a high shoulder belt (28) load to complete the truss. In an alternative embodiment, the load carrying member (130) is released from the backrest (14) only during adjustment of the backrest (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
 VEHICLE SEATBACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a vehicle seat of the type which carries a shoulder belt coupled to the backrest and in particular to such a seat having a load carrying member which couples to the backrest frame to form a truss structure to resist forward rotation of the backrest during a vehicle collision and releases to enable adjustment of the backrest angle.Motor vehicles are typically provided with an occupant restraint system comprised of belts which, for front seat occupants, includes a lap belt and a shoulder belt. These belts restrain an occupant within a vehicle seat. Most often, the belt restraint system is mounted directly to the vehicle structure adjacent to the vehicle seat. The position of the vehicle seat, relative to the vehicle body, is adjustable in at least the fore and aft direction and may be adjustable in other directions as well. When the belt restrain system is mounted to the vehicle, the seat is moved relative to the belt restraint system such that it can become inconvenient or uncomfortable for a seat occupant to use the belt restraint system. For example, if the vehicle seat is moved to its forward most position, it may be difficult to reach rearward to grasp the belt mounted to the vehicle behind the seat. Furthermore, in this forward most position, the shoulder belt may rub across the occupant's neck, creating discomfort.Accordingly, it is becoming more common to mount the belt restraint system directly to the seat so that the restraint system moves with the seat during adjustment. However, with the attachment of the restraint system to the seat, it is necessary to increase the load carrying capability of the seat compared to seats that do not support the restraint system. The result of increasing the seat strength is often an increase in the seat weight. This weight increase is contrary to the desire of vehicle manufacturers to remove weight from motor vehicles and thus improve fuel efficiency. Areas of a vehicle seat which typically need to be strengthened to accommodate the restraint system loads are the backrest frame and the recliner mechanism. Various approaches have been taken to strengthen the backrest and recliner mechanism. An example is shown in U.S. Patent 5,318,341 , commonly assigned with the present application. In that patent, one upright pilar of the backrest frame is reinforced to accommodate the shoulder belt load. In addition, a forward extending brace is attached to the backrest frame and extends
