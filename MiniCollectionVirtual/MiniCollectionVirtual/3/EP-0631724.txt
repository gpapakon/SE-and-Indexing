<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a supply station for pieces of dough for an automatic oven loading device. The supply station is composed of a frame (5) in which a broad endless belt (2) which is provided with an adjustable drive at a comfortable operating height is arranged in such a way that outside the frame (5) there is formed a projecting working surface (23) on which pieces of dough (6) can be placed manually. Removal by the loading tongue (8) of the group of pieces of dough which has been formed is carried out at 90 DEG  to the running direction of the belt (2) inside the frame (5). Above the broad endless belt (2) there is arranged an insertion frame (3) for accommodating raising platforms (4).

<CLAIMS>
A supply station for pieces of dough of a automatic oven loading device,
which comprises a loading tongue (8) equipped with a insertion belt

for the dough pieces (6) to be inserted and the hearths to be charged and
discharged, and which is disposed for displacement before a front of the

oven, characterized in that a continuous wide belt (2) provided with a controllable
drive is disposed at a operating height in a frame (5), which is

designed as a faction of the width of the loading tongue ad the depth of
the hearth, so that a operating desk (23) is formed, standing out outside

the frame (5) for dough pieces (6) to be placed thereon manually, and so
that picking the dough pieces (6) is effected by the loading tongue (8)

within the frame (5) in a manner displaced by 90Â° relative to the direction
of travel of the belt (2), at least one rack (3) being disposed above the continuous

wide belt (2) for fermentation boards (4) to be inserted.
A supply station for pieces of dough according to claim 1, characterized
in that the continuous wide belt (2) is guided over a driving shaft (21) disposed

in the frame (5) ad connected to a motor (12), ad on the opposite
side over a deflection pulley (22) disposed outside the frame (5) by means

of braces (52), cycled conveyance of the continuous wide belt (2) taking
place via the program control of the oven loading device in dependence on

the dressing time for the respective pieces of dough (6).
A supply station for pieces of dough according to claim 1, characterized
in that the continuous wide belt (2) is provided with colored marginal and

crosswise stripes (25) as a marking for the insertion surface. 
A supply station for pieces of dough according to claim 1, characterized
in that the racks (3) are U-shaped sections disposed so that a single deck

can lodge three fermentation boards (4).
A supply station for pieces of dough according to claim 4, characterized
in that bearing shackles (7) are disposed on the frame (5'), facilitating the

threading into the racks (3) of the fermentation boards (4).
