<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for fixing a device unit in a hole (5) of a metal base plate (1). In this process, mutually adjoining marginal areas (5a, 5b) of the hole (5) and the unit (7) are fused together by melting adjacent material areas of base plate (1) and unit (7) by means of a beam of light (laser light) collimated in parallel. A punch (15) is inserted into the hole (5) in which the unit (7) is to be secured in an accurately orientated manner in the x-, y- and z-axis of the base plate. A punch (15) is inserted first of all in the exact x-, y- and z-orientation relative to the base plate (1) in such a way that the hole margin (5a) is pressed up in the punching or z-axis direction at several hole-margin points distributed over 360 angular degrees of the hole margin (5a), as a result of which a protective layer (3) on the base plate (1) is broken up or removed before the fusion operation by this mechanical deformation in the fusion area in such a way that the blank metal is exposed in the fusion area, that the punch (15) is exchanged for the unit (7) to be fastened, and that the light used for the melting directly strikes the exposed metal, melts the latter and fuses it to the likewise melted surface area (7a) of the unit (7) between the pressed-out lugs (21) at the hole-margin points and the unit (7).

A method of securing an apparatus part in a hole (5) in a metal base plate 
(1), adjoining peripheral areas (5a, 7a) of the part (7) and of the hole (5), in which the 

part (7) is to be secured in a precise orientation relative to the x, y and z axes of the 
base plate, being fused to one another by melting adjoining material portions of the base 

plate (1) and the part (7) by means of a parallel beam of coherent light, 
characterised in 
that
 a mandril (15) is first introduced into the hole (5) in the exact x, y and z orientation 
relative to the base plate (1), in that the edge (5a) of the hole is upset in the mandril 

direction or z-axis direction at a plurality of peripheral areas of the hole which are 
equispaced along the 360 angular degrees of the edge (5a) of the hole, as a result of 

which a protective layer (3) on the base plate (1) is broken up or removed by 
mechanical deformation in the fusing area prior to fusing, so as to expose the bare 

metal in the fusing area, in that the mandril (15) is replaced by the part (7) to be 
secured, and in that the light which serves for fusing then impinges directly on the 

exposed metal, melts this metal and fuses with the equally molten surface area (7a) of 
the part (7) between the supports (1c) formed by upsetting at the peripheral areas of the 

hole and the part (7). 
A device for carrying out a method as claimed in Claim 1, comprising 
dies (9a, 9b) which are applicable to the base plate (1) from both sides in such a 

manner that they cover the peripheral area (11) of the hole while leaving the hole (5) 
free, and a mandril (15) which is introducible in a deformation direction from the first 

die (9a) into the second die (9b) through the hole (5) in the base plate (1) with a proper 
fit, the mandril (15) having radially projecting shoulders (19) which are spaced from the 

mandril head (15c), which shoulders are engageable in grooves (10) of the first die (9a) 
and during introduction of the mandril (15) only move into the area of the base plate 

(1), the second die (9b) having chambers (21) in line with the direction of introduction 
(17) of the shoulders (19), into which chambers the sheet material which is displaceable 

by the shoulders (19) can be pressed to form the supports (1c).
