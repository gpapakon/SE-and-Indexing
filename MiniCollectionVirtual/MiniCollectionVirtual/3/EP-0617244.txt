<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an air heater with a housing which is formed by an upper shell and a lower shell. The two shells are brought into engagement by projecting parts on the one shell and correspondingly shaped recesses on the other shell and are held together by resilient catch elements. Mounting and dismounting of the two housing shells can thus be effected without separate tools. Advantageously, inflow and outflow grilles arranged on the housing and also a lid part are also fastened thereto by means of resilient catch connections and serve advantageously, at the same time, for vertically clamping together the two housing shells.

<CLAIMS>
An air heater (1) with, disposed in a housing (2), a 
burner (9) for generating hot combustion gases which, 

in a heat exchanger (5), delivers heat energy to 
heating air which is delivered along the inside wall 

of the housing (2) from an air inlet port (25) to an 
air outlet port (26), whereby, in the longitudinal 

direction, the housing (2) is subdivided by at least 
one horizontally extending joint (28) into an upper 

shell (29) and a lower shell (30), characterised in 
that one of the shells (29) has, projecting in a 

vertical direction in the region of the joint (28), 
parts (31) which engage correspondingly shaped 

depressions (32) on the other shell (30) and in that 
furthermore in a horizontal direction there are catch 

elements (33; 48; 46, 47; 15, 34; 35) adapted for 
movement resiliently in a horizontal direction 

crosswise to the joint (28) and which clamp both 
shells (29, 30) in a vertical direction. 
An air heater (1) according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that the catch elements are formed by parts (33) 

connected to the shells (29, 30). 
An air heater (1) according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the catch elements are formed by 

catch projections (33, 46) provided on a shell (29) 
and catch depressions (47, 48) disposed on the other 

shell (30). 
An air heater (1) according to Claim 3, characterised 
in that the catch projections are constructed as 

calotte-cap shaped studs (46) while the catch 
depressions are constructed as matchingly shaped 

depressions (47).  
 
An air heater (1) according to one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that at least a part of the 

catch elements are formed by separate parts (15, 34, 
35) which clamp together the two shells (29, 30). 
An air heater (1) according to Claim 5, characterised 
in that, as a clamping part, an air inlet (15) and/or 

air outlet grid (34) is used which, at the ends, 
engages around projections (22) provided on the shells 

(29, 30). 
An air heater (1) according to one of the preceding 
Claims, with a cover (35) covering an aperture (36) on 

one of the shells (29), characterised in that the 
cover (35) engages over the top (16) of the shell (29) 

and in that the respective shell (29) and/or the cover 
(35) have resiliently movable catch elements in the 

region of the side walls (17, 41 respectively). 
An air heater (1) according to Claim 7, characterised 
in that the cover (35) engages fully around a shell 

(29), its catch elements engaging those of the other 
shell (30) so that both shells (29, 30) are clamped 

together. 
An air heater (1) according to Claim 7 or 8, 
characterised in that adjacent one of the shells (29) 

around which the cover (35) engages there is adjacent 
the aperture (36) a semi-circular recess (37) which 

together with an oppositely open semi-circular recess 
(38) in the cover (35) forms a circular aperture (39) 

for the passage of a cable (40). 
An air heater (1) according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that on both sides of the aperture (36) and at the 

same height there is a semi-circular recess (37) in  
 

each of the side walls (17) of the shell (29) and in 
that the cover (35) can optionally be so fitted onto 

the aperture (36) that its recess (38), together with 
one of the recesses (37) on the shell (29), forms an 

aperture (39). 
An air heater (1) according to one of Claims 7 to 10, 
characterised in that elements (45) which are under 

the cover (35) and which are accessible through the 
aperture (36) are disposed for adjustment, monitoring, 

diagnosis and/or maintenance of the heater.
