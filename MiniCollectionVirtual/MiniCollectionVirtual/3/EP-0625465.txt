<ABSTRACT>
A method and a device for removing a sheeting (3) serving as protection and/or as a transport safeguard from a product stack resting on a pallet (2) and especially on a standard pallet is proposed. So that the removal of the sheeting, hitherto carried out purely manually, can be executed more efficiently, the product stack (1) provided with the sheeting (3) is delivered to a separating station, in which the sheeting (3) is grasped at at least one point by means of a mechanical device and is first partially lifted off from the surface of the product stack (1) and/or pallet (2). The sheeting (3) is subsequently separated as a whole from the product stack (1) and pallet (2) and delivered by means of at least one gripping device to a collecting container for the purpose of disposal. For drawing off the sheeting (3) from the product stack, there are provided horizontally moveable grippers (8) and separating elements (11) moveable in the gaps between the side walls of the product stack (1) and the sheeting (3).

Method for removing a securing and/or protective 
film from a stack of goods resting on a pallet and in 

particular a standard pallet, in which method the stack 
of goods provided with the film is fed to a separating 

station, in which the film is initially gripped at at 
least one point, is then separated completely from the 

side surfaces of the stack of goods and from the pallet 
and is finally fed to a collecting container for the 

purposes of disposal, characterized in that the film (3) 
is initially gripped by suction elements (25) and is 

partly detached and lifted from the surface of the stack 
of goods (1) and/or from the pallet (2) by withdrawing 

the suction elements (25), in that subsequently at least 
one separating element (11) travels slowly upwards inside 

the gap between the side wall of the stack of goods (1) 
and the film (3), and in that, whilst moving upwards, the 

separating element (11) increasingly detaches the film 
(3) from the stack of goods (1). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the pallet (2) with the stack of goods (1) resting 

on it is freed in the separating station, by means of a 
vertical movement relative to its support, at least to 

such an extent that the underside of the pallet (2), 
covered with film, is no longer resting on the support. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an elongated, rotatable roll is used as separating 

element (11). 
Method according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the roll moves into the spread-out part of the film 

(3), and in that the roll is subsequently moved vertically  
 

and over the entire height of the stack of goods 
(1) and, in so doing, separates the respective film side 

(16a, 16b, 16c, 16d) of the film (3) from the stack of 
goods (1). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the film (3) is weakened, during the 

vertical movement of the separating element (11), by 
supplying heat in the region of the vertical edges of the 

stack of goods (1). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the respective film side (16a, 16b, 16c, 

16d) is held firmly at its lower edge during the vertical 
movement of the separating element (11). 
Method according to one of Claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the film (3) is held firmly on the upper 

side (19) of the stack of goods (1), at least for the 
duration of the vertical movement of the separating 

element (11), by a hold-down means (17, 34, 35). 
Method according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that, following the feeding of the stack 

of goods (1) into the separating station, the individual 
layers of the stack of goods are initially centred before 

the film (3) is separated from the stack of goods, or 
before the film (3) is finally removed in its entirety 

from the stack of goods. 
Device for removing a securing and/or protective 
film from a stack of goods resting o
n a pallet and in 
particular on a standard pallet, having horizontally 

movable means (25) for gripping the film (3) and having 
separating elements (11) for completely separating the 

film (3) from the side surfaces of the stack of goods 
(1), characterized in that the means (25) are suction 

elements for gripping and subsequently partly spreading 
out the film (3), in that the separating elements (11) 

can be moved vertically in the gaps between the side 
walls of the stack of goods (1) and the film (3), and in 

that at least one gripping device (18) is provided, with 
which the film (3) may be gripped as a whole at its upper 

side for the purpose of later disposal.  
 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized by 
rotatable, elongated rolls as separating elements. 
Device according to Claim 9 or Claim 10, characterized 
in that, close to the side surfaces of the stack 

of goods (1), there are arranged lances (43) which may be 
moved vertically and horizontally and whose downwardly 

directed free end is designed as a blade (48) for piercing 
or penetrating that portion of the film (3) partially 

spread out by the suction elements (25). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that grippers (8; 45) for firmly holding 

the lower edge of the film (3) are arranged on all four 
sides of the stack of goods (1). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by at least one heating element (15) which 

can be moved along the vertical edges of the stack of 
goods (1) and is intended for applying heat to the film 

(3) exclusively in the region of these edges. 
Device according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that the location of the application of heat by the 

heating element (15) is in each case located above the 
separating element (11), and the heating element (15) and 

the separating element (11) are designed such that they 
may be moved together vertically along the stack of goods 

(1). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized by aligning elements (11) which are 

arranged parallel to the side surfaces of the stack of 
goods (1), may be moved along these and are intended for 

the lateral centring of the individual layers of the 
stack of goods (1).
