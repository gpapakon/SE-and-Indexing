<ABSTRACT>
A belt conveyor (10) has vertically spaced, oppositely moving, upper (14) and lower (18) load carrying runs having entrance and exit ends (16, 17; 20, 21). A first series of rollers disposed between the exit end (17) of the upper run (14) and the entrance end (20) of the lower run (18) direct the belt downwardly, around a first drive assembly (26), toward the entrance end (20) of the lower run (18) along a first depressed section (37) of belt travel below the level of the lower run (18) and upwardly to the entrance end (20) of the lower run (18) from a static takeup (38) installed below the lower run. A second series of rollers disposed between the exit end (21) of the lower run (18) and the entrance end (16) of the upper run (14) direct the belt downwardly from the lower run exit end (21) along a second depressed section (44) of belt travel below the level of the lower run, around a second drive assembly (48) and upwardly to the entrance end (16) of the upper run (14). Lower run feed (105, 106, 107) and take-away (113, 114, 115) conveyors, respectively arranged above the first (37) and second (44) depressed sections of belt travel, converge into and diverge from alignment with the lower run entrance (20) and exit (21) ends for the in-line transfer of articles to and from the lower run (18). Upper run feed (120) and take-away (122) conveyors are aligned longitudinally with the upper run entrance and exit ends.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a belt conveyor system 
comprising: 
an endless belt; belt support means supporting said belt for travel on 
a load carrying run having an entrance end and an exit end, 
and a series of roller means directing said belt and 
including belt drive roller means, and drive means coupled 
thereto. Such a system is disclosed in U.S. Patent 
5,056,647. In that system, belt conveyors, arranged in 
tandem or end-to-end relation, transport baggage in one 
direction only. In other words, separate conveyors are 
required for outbound and for inbound baggage. According to a first aspect of the present 
invention, there is provided a belt conveyor system as set 
out in the opening paragraph of the present specification, 
in which the belt support means support the said belt for 
travel on an upper load carrying run having an entrance end 
and an exit end, and on a lower load carrying run spaced 
vertically below said upper run, said lower run having 
entrance and exit ends facing oppositely to said upper run 
entrance and exit ends; in which the system further 
comprises : 
a lower run feed conveyor converging laterally into 
alignment with said lower run at the entrance end thereof, 
and a lower run take away conveyor diverging laterally from  
 
alignment with said lower run at the exit end thereof; a first series of roller means directing said belt 
downwardly from said upper run exit, horizontally below 
said lower run feed conveyor, and upwardly to said lower 
run entrance end; a second series of roller means directing said belt 
downwardly from said lower run exit end, horizontally below 
said lower run take away conveyor, and upwardly to said 
upper run entrance end; and in which at least one of said first and second 
series of roller means includes a belt drive roller; dynamic takeup roller means applying tension to said 
belt on the downstream side of said drive roller means. The ability to convey loads in one direction on 
one of the upper or lower runs and in the opposite 
direction on the other of these runs of the belt conveyor 
offers many advantages where the bi-directional movement of 
loads is required, as in the handling of baggage at an 
airport. Each of the first and second series of rollers 
may include a belt drive roller, a drive unit of rollers 
may include a belt drive roller, a drive unit coupled 
thereto, and a dynamic takeup on the downstream side of the 
drive roller for applying tension to the belt. Preferably, one of said first and second series 
of roller means
