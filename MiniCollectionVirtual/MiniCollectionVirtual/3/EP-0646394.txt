<ABSTRACT>
A striding exercise device (10) includes a base (12) 
having two elongated parallel tracks (22) which curve upwardly 

in a constant radial arc, and two footskates (14) which are 
rotatably supported on the tracks (22) for reciprocating 

movement thereon. The radial arc generally corresponds 
to the natural swinging arc of a human leg as the leg 

pivots about the hip. When the operator stands on the 
footskates (14) and reciprocates the footskates (14) back and forth 

along the upwardly curved tracks (22), the operator's torso is 
maintained in a stationary and balanced position over the 

base (12). The reduction in torso movement substantially 
eliminates strain on the leg joints, particularly the 

knee and hip joints, caused by up and down movement of 
the torso and further substantially eliminates back 

strain caused by reaching and bending at the waist.

<DESCRIPTION>
The instant invention relates to exercise apparatus 
and more particularly to a striding exerciser which 
simulates the natural exercise of walking. Walking, jogging, and cross-country skiing have been 
found to be effective activities for exercising the body, 
and in particular, the legs, hear and lungs. However, 
these activities are primarily outdoor activities which 
can be severely limited by adverse weather and geographic 
conditions. The limitations of traditional outdoor 
exercise activities have in some respects been resolved 
by the development of indoor exercise devices which 
simulate particular exercise activities. In this regard, 
a wide variety of walking, striding and cross-country 
skiing devices have heretofore been known in the art. In 
this connection, the U.S. Patents to Dalebout No. 
4,850,585; Hix No. 4,654,200; Bull et al. No. 4,940,233; 
and Friedebach No. 4,804,178 are thought to be 
particularly relevant to the instant invention. The patent to Friedebach discloses a cross-country 
skiing device comprising a pair of parallel horizontal 
rails and a pair of footplates which are movably 
supported on the rails. The Friedebach cross-country 
skiing device further includes a belt mechanism which  
 
causes the footplates to move in unison in opposite 
directions. Still further, the skiing device includes 
two independent hand levers which pivot back and forth to 
simulate the movement of cross-country ski poles. In 
use, the operator stands upon the footplates, and 
reciprocates the footplates back and forth while 
simultaneously pushing and pulling the hand levers. 
While the Friedebach cross-country skiing device is 
capable of providing a significant aerobic workout, it 
has been found that it also places a tremendous amount of 
stress on the operator's back and leg joints. The 
reciprocating movement of the feet along a horizontal 
path causes the operator's torso to move up and down, 
thereby forcing the operator to continuously lift his/her 
body weight with each stride. In addition, the up and 
down lifting motion of the torso increases the stress 
placed on the leg joints, particularly the hip and knee 
joints. Still further, the pushing and pulling of the 
hand levers forces the operator to bend over and reach 
from the waist which unnecessarily stresses the back 
muscles. Accordingly, it has been found that persons who 
have back, knee or hip problems often find it 
uncomfortable, painful, or even impossible to utilize 
ski-type exercise machines. The patents to Dalebout,

<CLAIMS>
A striding exercise device comprising a base (12) including two 
elongated parallel tracks (22), and two footskates (14) which are respectively 

movably supported on said parallel tracks (22), said exercise device being 
characterised in that said parallel tracks curve upwardly in a continuous arc, 

said continuous arc generally corresponding to a natural swinging arc of a 
human leg as said leg pivots around a hip joint. 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 1, in which a mechanism (16) is 
provided for moving the footskates (14) in unison in opposite directions along 

said tracks (22). 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 2, in which said mechanism (16) 
comprises two pulleys(34) which are respectively mounted between said 

parallel tracks (22) at front and rear ends of said base (12), and a cord (38) 
which extends along said tracks (22) and around said pulleys (34) to form a 

continuous loop, said cord (38) being attached to said footskates (14). 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 1, in which the tracks (22) 
includes two spaced parallel grooves (26), and further in which the footskates 

(14) includes spaced wheels (32) which ride in said grooves (26). 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 1, in which two arm levers (60)  
 

are pivotally mounted at opposite sides of said base (12). 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 5, in which a mechanism is 
provided for adjusting a tension level of said arm levers (60). 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 1, in which a handlebar (46) is 
provided for supporting an operator. 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 1, in which said continuous arc 
comprises a constant radial arc. 
An exercise device as claimed in claim 1, in which said base (12) 
includes a contoured upper surface (20), said elongated parallel tracks (22) 

comprising spaced parallel grooves (26) formed in said contoured upper surface 
(20), and further in which the footskates (14) include spaced wheels (32) 

which ride in said grooves (26).
