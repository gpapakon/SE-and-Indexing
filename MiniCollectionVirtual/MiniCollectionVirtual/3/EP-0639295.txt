<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to improved metal hydride cells having
improved cycle life and charge retention. More particularly, the invention relates to the
optimization of the negative electrode alloys and the separator in order to improve cycle
life and charge retention.In rechargeable electrochemical cells, weight and portability are important
considerations. It is also advantageous for rechargeable cells to have long operating lives
without the necessity of periodic maintenance. Rechargeable cells may be used as direct
replacements for primary AA, C, and D cells in numerous consumer devices such as
calculators, portable radios, and flashlights. They are often configured into a sealed power
pack that is designed as an integral part of a specific device. Rechargeable
electrochemical cells can also be configured as larger cells that can be used, for example,
in industrial, aerospace and electric vehicle applications.The best rechargeable cell is one that can operate as an "install and forget" power
source. With the exception of periodic charging, a rechargeable cell should perform
without attention and should not become a limiting factor in the life of the device it
powers.There are two basic types of nickel metal hydride rechargeable hydrogen storage
materials ("Ni-MH materials") the AB2 type and the AB5 type. These types of material
are discussed in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,096,667 to Fetcenko, et. al, the contents of
which are incorporated herein by reference. The term "Ovonic alloy" is frequently used
to refer to all AB2 type materials in deference to their development from amorphous thin
film materials discovered by Stanford R. Ovshinsky. Ovonic alloys are described in U.S.
Patent No. 4,551,400 for Hydrogen Storage Materials and Methods of Sizing and
Preparing the Same for Electrochemical Applications (hereinafter the '400 patent) to
Sapru, Hong, Fetcenko and Venkatesan, the contents of which are incorporated herein by
reference.As used herein, the term "Ovonic Base Alloy" refers to an AB2 alloy having a base
alloy or grain phase (as this term is described in the '400 patent) containing 0.1 to 60 
atomic percent Ti, 0.1 to 25 atomic percent Zr, 0.1 to 60 atomic percent V, 0.1 to 57
atomic percent Ni, and 0.1 to 56 atomic percent Cr.In general, Ni-MH hydrogen storage cells or batteries (referred to collectively as
"Ni-MH cells") utilize a negative electrode that is capable of the reversible
electrochemical storage of hydrogen. Ni-MH cells usually employ a positive electrode of
nickel
