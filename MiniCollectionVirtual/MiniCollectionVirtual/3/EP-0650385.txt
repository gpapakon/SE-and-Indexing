<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for holding a boot on a surfboard, namely a snowboard. The device includes a fastening element (10), associated with the board, and cooperating with a complementary fastening element (11) associated with the boot, the fastening assembly providing a boot/board coupling with different degrees of freedom. The device is characterized in that it includes a groove means (22), for one of the elements, and a rib means (12), for the other, the rib and groove having complementary shapes in order to cooperate in a nesting relationship. The device also includes an engagement means (28) for one of the elements and a locking means (31) for the other element, which form a removable lock for actively maintaining the rib engaged within the groove.

nested in the groove (15, 51, 52, 99) at least along the nesting direction, the latching means

comprising, for one of the elements (10, 11), at least one hooking means (28, 66, 67, 98) and, for the
other element (10, 11), at least one sash bolt (31, 47, 48, 70, 71, 110) or a slide bolt, the latching

means being located towards the middle of the rib (12, 40, 60, 61, 95, 96) and the groove (15, 51,
52, 99) or distributed along the length of the rib (40) and the groove (15, 51, 52, 99), and that it

further comprises a control means (35, 73, 112) to at least open the latching means voluntarily.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the rib (12, 60, 61, 95, 96) and the
groove (15, 51, 52, 99) extend along a principal direction parallel to the upper surface of the board,

and that the latch (28, 66, 67, 98, 31, 70, 71, 110) is located toward the middle of the rib and the
groove.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the latching means comprises at 
least two sash bolts (47, 48) distributed along the length of the rib (40).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the latch (28, 47, 48, 66, 67, 85,
31, 70, 71) retains the rib (12, 40, 60, 61, 95) nested in the groove (15, 51, 52) along the nesting

direction and along the principal direction of the rib.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the rib (12, 40,
60, 61, 95, 96) and/or the groove (15, 51, 52, 99) have inclined sides (17, 18, 19, 20, 91, 92, 93, 94,

101, 102, 103, 104).
Device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the groove
and/or the rib (40) have sides (41, 42) of asymmetrical inclination and/or orientation.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the top (43) of
the rib (40) and/or the bottom of the rib are inclined with respect to a horizontal plane parallel to the

surface of the board.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the rib (12, 60,
61) and the groove (15, 51, 52) extend along a principal direction parallel to the longitudinal and

transverse direction defined by the sole of the boot.
Device according to any of the preceding claims, characterized in that the rib and the
groove extend along a principal direction transverse to the longitudinal and transverse direction

defined by the sole of the boot.
Device according to any of claims 1-8, characterized in that the rib (95, 96) and the
