<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to preservatives for wood
and other cellulosic materials.The use of biocidal metal ions in wood preservation
is well known. There are also many compounds containing
a triazole group which are known to possess biocidal
properties. By way of example, EP-88256 discloses herbicidal compositions containing particular
triazoles along with other active ingredients. There is no suggestion to use the
compositions for wood preservation nor is there any suggestion to make a formulation
claimed by the present application. EP-447756 (relevant art under Article 54(3)
discloses compositions for use in wood preservation including inter alia compositions
containing propiconazole and an aluminium containing compound. However the
maximum ratio of metal:azole contemplated by EP-447756 is around 1:2. According to the present invention there are
provided preservative compositions comprising a synergistic
mixture of a biocidal metal compound and a fungicidal
compound containing a triazole group selected from:
a) compounds of formula (A):

wherein R1 represents a branched or straight chain
C1-5 alkyl group and R2 represents a phenyl group
optionally substituted by one or more substituents
selected from halogen atoms and C1-3 alkyl, C1-3 alkoxy,
phenyl and nitro groups;b) compounds of formula (B):

wherein R3 is as defined for R2 above and R4
represents a hydrogen atom or a branched or straight
chain C1-5 alkyl group; and c) hexaconazole and difenoconazole;
wherein the weight ratio of metal atom: fungicidal
compound containing the triazole group is at least 5:1;
with the specific exception of composition (a) which
contains 1.320% by weight of sodium nitrite, 1.190% by
weight of copper sulphate 5H20, 0.400% by weight of boric
acid, 0.625% by weight of sodium heptonate, 0.390% by
weight of sodium hydroxide, 0.012% by weight of
tebuconazole 0.391% by weight of surfactant blend in
xylene and 95.762% by weight of water.We have found that compositions according to the
invention possess advantageous properties: in
particular, it has been found that the metal compound
and the fungicidal compound containing the triazole
group (hereinafter "the triazole compound") exhibit
synergistic fungicidal activity.It will be understood that the metal compound may
be present in a form such that metal ions are free in
solution or may form part of a complex. Similarly, the
triazole compound may be free in solution or may be
present in the form of a salt or a complex. For
example, the triazole compound could be present in the
form
