<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a silver halide 
photographic element having increased contrast and a 
method of making same. Conventional photographic elements contain 
emulsions of silver halide crystals which, upon 
exposure to light, form images. Silver halide in its 
unfinished or primitive state is only moderately 
sensitive to light in the blue region of the spectrum. 
Therefore, a silver halide emulsion is generally 
chemically modified to adjust its properties and 
optimize it for a particular photographic application. 
For example, chemical sensitizers may be added to 
increase the sensitivity (speed) of an emulsion; 
spectral sensitizing dyes may be added to extend the 
response of an emulsion to wavelengths where the silver 
halide does not normally respond; antifoggants may be 
added to reduce the developability of silver halide 
crystals in unexposed regions; and latent image keeping 
agents may be used to preserve the exposed image until 
it can be processed. Even with all these chemical modifiers, often 
referred to as addenda, it is still sometimes 
impossible to build all of the desired characteristics 
into a silver halide emulsion for a particular 
application. This is because such chemical modifiers 
often interact with each other. For example, spectral 
sensitizing dyes may extend the intrinsic sensitivity 
of the emulsion to other wavelengths, but too much dye 
can cause dye desensitization and loss of speed. 
Antifoggants are effective at controlling unwanted 
development, but they may also cause loss of intrinsic 
speed. This problem is exacerbated in photographic  
 
elements having a high silver chloride content such as 
photosensitive paper used for color prints. Typically, 
silver chloride emulsions, which have a faster 
development rate, exhibit increased fogging 
characteristics and emulsion sensitivity changes owing 
to high temperatures and/or humidity conditions which 
may be incurred during storage. One common problem in optimizing a silver 
halide emulsion is low contrast. Contrast as measured 
by gamma is the slope of the straight-line portion of 
the D-logE curve. Low contrast results in a poor 
discrimination between the highlights and the shadows 
of the developed image. Manipulation of chemical 
addenda may be effective at producing the desired fog 
level, photographic speed, granularity (a measure of 
signal-to-noise), and other properties such as pressure 
sensitivity, but the emulsion will be left with too low 
a contrast for the intended use. A position is often
