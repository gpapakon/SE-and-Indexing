<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to digital phase and timing control and 
particularly to an all digital method and apparatus for controlled 
phase shifting, signal synchronization and data recovery. Reference is made to our copending European patent applications 
being filed concurrently herewith and which relate to a high data rate 
digital data/clock recovery system. The applications correspond to our 
US applications: 
   "All Digital High Speed Algorithmic Recovery Method and Apparatus 
Using Locally Generated Compensated Broad Band Time Rulers and Data 
Edge Position Averaging", serial number 08/021,924; filing date Feb. 
24, 1993; inventor Bin Guo, and 
   "Digital Variable In-Lock Range Phase Comparator", serial number 
08/021,710; filing date Feb. 24, 1993; inventor Bin Guo. The related European Patent documents are EP-A- 0 614 281 and EP-A 0 613 253, respectively. In clock or data recovery and in other phase and timing control 
operations, phase or timing adjustments are usually performed after a 
phase or timing error is detected. Traditionally, a Phase Locked Loop 
(PLL) is employed, in which the frequency of a Voltage Controlled 
Oscillator (VCO) is adjusted to achieve the phase adjustment or 
alignment through a number of cycles. The amount of the phase change 
is the integral of the difference between the VCO frequency and the 
reference frequency. These are generally  
 
analog PLL circuits which contain various lumped capacitors and lumped 
resistors to form the analogue low pass filter function for obtaining a smoothed 
or filtered control signal for VCO. Monolithic circuit integration of the PLL along 
with large scale digital circuitry is difficult, especially using standard 
manufacturing processes for digital circuits. In addition, problems associated 
with phase locked loop design such as susceptibility to digital switching noise 
limits the traditional CMOS analog PLL design to applications, at less than 
100MHZ. In digital data recovery or digital signal synchronization applications, 
digitally controlled delay cell technologies are often utilized. A plurality of such 
delay cells can be cascaded to form a delay line which can then delay a signal, 
whether data, clock or control signal, to provide a plurality of delayed, or phase 
shifted copies of the original signal from the taps of the delay line. These 
delayed signals can then be sampled, or detected, or registered to be analyzed 
in subsequent logic to determine their phase relationship with a reference signal 
or signals to enable
