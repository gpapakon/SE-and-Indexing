<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a coil winding apparatus which is simplified in 
structure, reduced in cost and improved in operation efficiency. The coil winding 

apparatus comprises a housing (43) intermittently rotatable around a fixed axis 
between first and second positions, a plurality of spindles (46) mounted for 

rotation on front and rear faces of the housing (43), a pair of drive sections 
(45A, B) including a bidirectional motor and provided independently of each other 

for transmitting rotation of the motor to rotate the spindles (46), an insulation sheet 
supply section (10) opposed to the spindles (46) on one of the faces of the housing 

(43) when the housing is at any of the first and second positions for supplying 
films (4) to bobbins (2) mounted on the spindles (46), and a wire supply section (9) 

for supplying wires (3) to bobbins (2) mounted on the other spindles (46). Since 
the drive sections (45A, B) are provided independently of each other for the 

different spindles (46), the directions and the speeds of rotation of the spindles can 
be set arbitrarily.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a coil winding apparatus for producing a coil of
the layer type wherein a wire and an insulation sheet are wound alternately on a
bobbin.A coil of the layer type wherein a wire and an insulation sheet are wound
alternately on a bobbin is used, for example, with a flyback transformer for use
with a communication apparatus such as, for example, a television set of the Braun
tube type or a radar.Various coil winding apparatus for producing a coil of the layer type are
known, and one of such coil winding apparatus is disclosed, for example, in
Japanese Patent Laid-Open Application No. Showa 63-164207.The coil winding apparatus includes a frame member mounted for
intermittent pivotal motion by 180 degrees around a pivot shaft, a pair of spindle
trains formed on different faces of the frame member and each including a plurality
of bobbin holding spindles mounted for rotation on the respective face of the frame
member, drive means including a motor for transmitting rotation of the motor to
the spindles of the spindle trains to rotate the spindles, insulation sheet supply
means adapted to oppose one of the spindle trains at a position after the frame
member is rotated and changed over by 180 degrees for supplying insulation sheets
to bobbins mounted on the spindles, and wire supply means for supplying wires to
the bobbins mounted on the spindles. When the insulation sheets are wound onto
the bobbins mounted on the spindles of one of the spindle trains, the wires are
simultaneously wound onto the bobbins mounted on the spindles of the other
spindle train.Then, after winding of the insulation sheets or the wires for a first layer,
the frame member is rotated by 180 degrees so that the spindles of the one spindle
train are now opposed to the wire supply means and the wires are wound onto the
insulation sheets on the bobbins while the spindles of the other spindle train are
opposed to the insulation sheet supply means and the insulation sheets are wound
onto the bobbins. Such a sequence of operations is repeated by a predetermined
number of times, and as a result of such repetition, the insulation sheets and the
wires are alternately wound onto the bobbins to form coils of the layer type.After insulation sheets and wires are wound by the predetermined number
of times onto the bobbins, the bobbins are removed and new bobbins are mounted 
onto the spindles instead, and thereafter, the insulation sheets and the wires are
wound alternately in a similar manner onto the new bobbins.Here in the
