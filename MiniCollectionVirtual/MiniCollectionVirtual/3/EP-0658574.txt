<CLAIMS>
A process for producing a plastisol composition,
characterized in that 0.1 to 5 wt%, based on the weight of

the total plastisol composition, of an adhesion promoter selected
from a group consisting of amido amines, imido amines

and ester amines is added to a plastisol comprising polyvinyl
chloride, polyvinyl chloride copolymers and polyalkylene

methacrylate in a plasticizer in order to form the plastisol
composition, the adhesion promoter being a product from


the reaction of at least one ethylenically unsaturated
compound which is a styrene, an α-olefin, a vinyl ether or an

allyl ether, with at least one monounsaturated carboxylic
acid or monounsaturated carboxylic acid derivative in order

to form a copolymer;
reaction of the copolymer with at least one polyamine
with at least one primary amino group in order to form the

adhesion promoter.
The process of claim 1, characterized in that the α-olefin
has 10 to 24 carbon atoms.
The process of claim 1, characterized in that the
monounsaturated carboxylic acid or derivative thereof is

acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or the methyl or ethyl ester
thereof.
The process of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the monounsaturated carboxylic acid is maleic acid, maleic

anhydride or fumaric acid.
The process of claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the derivative of the monounsaturated carboxylic acid is glycidyl

ester.
The process of any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the polyamine is N-aminoethylpiperazine.
The process of claim 2, characterized in that the
formed copolymer has one of the following formulas: 



where

X = 1; y = 1 - 4; n = 5 - 50;
R

 is a hydrocarbon
residue with 2 to 14 carbon atoms and having one or more

amino groups, or R

 form with the amide nitrogen atom a
piperazine ring:



where
x = 1; y = 1 - 2; n = 5 - 50;
R

 alkyl
R

 is a hydrocarbon residue with 2 to 14 carbon atoms and
having one or more amino groups:


The process of any of the above claims, characterized
in that the adhesion promoter is an imido amine which is the

product from 

the reaction of an α-olefin with 10 to 24 carbon atoms
with maleic acid, maleic anhydride or fumaric acid in order

to form a copolymer; and
the reaction of the copolymer with at least one polyamine
with at least one primary amino group.
The process of claim 8, characterized in that the copolymer
is a reaction product from an α-olefin with 14 to 16

carbon atoms and maleic anhydride, the copolymer then being
reacted with N-aminoethylpiperazine.
