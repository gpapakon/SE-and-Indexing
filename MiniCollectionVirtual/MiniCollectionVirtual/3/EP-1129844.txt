<ABSTRACT>
A composite stratified decorated panel from glass
and/or transparent plastics variously decorated with

one- or full-color decorations, particularly for use in
building, transport, and the like, comprising a first

pane from glass or transparent plastics, a second pane
from glass or transparent plastics or thin film and a

transparent film or plastics sheet, for instance
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), bearing a decoration

obtained with sublimable colors placed between said two

panes from glass and/or transparent plastics, stably
associated to said panes by means of glue or adhesive

layers, for instance polyurethane and heat lamination.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composite stratified
panel from glass and/or transparent plastics, variously
decorated with one- or full-color decorations, in
particular for structural and/or decorative use in'
building, transport, industrial fields, furniture, and
the like.The invention also relates to a process for the
realization of said composite, stratified, decorated
panel.As is known, glazing according to the known art can be
obtained by means of the following technologies:
Silk printing on glass, also with various colors by
means of ceramic coatings (through an appropriate
sequence of frames). Apart from the cost of the
investment, the silk printing process has a very
complex nature, needs high temperatures for the
evaporation of solvents and the ceramization; the
definition is not very high because of the
profilometric roughness (banana-peel), which is typical
of ceramic material silk printing. The utilizable
colors are limited; besides, lead presence often limits
such process for ecological reasons;Chemical engraving of the glass surface with special
aggressive materials. The colors utilizable are very 
limited, as well as the definition and the possibility
of particular scenographies;Coloring the glass surface with aggressive pigments, or
through deposition technologies (e.g., vacuum arc
deposition coating), but coloring is very limited as
concerns the number and the definition;Lamination of colored paper of a decorative type
obtained by printing. The definition of the image is
very poor, especially in case of full-colors, and
therefore decoration is limited to one-color patterns,
also very complex and particularly fancy, such as lace
patterns. The colors utilized may be either light or
dark, but in any case always of one only color; this
lamination technology includes also the decoration made
directly on the adhesive, which however allows only a
limited number of colors and very small images, given
the low definition of the outline of greater decorative
patterns.Other less known technologies are possible, such as the
working of glasses of several colors which may offer in
the mass multicolor glasses similar to those of art-vases
and colored window panes in churches or
buildings.These technologies are very complex, with remarkable
limitations as concerns the range of decorations that 
can be obtained, the colors, the aesthetic aspect and
the applications of the finished product and the cost.Object of the present invention is to realize and
provide a one- or full-color transparent panel
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A composite stratified panel from glass and/or
transparent plastics, variously decorated with one- or

full-color decoration, particularly for use in
building, transport, and the like, characterized in

that it comprises:

a first pane from glass or transparent plastics,
a second pane from glass or transparent plastics,
a film or sheet from transparent plastics bearing
said decoration, placed between said two panes from

glass and/or transparent panes and stably associated
thereto by means of layers of suitable adhesives

through calendering or heat lamination.
The composite stratified panel according to claim 1,characterized in that said second pane from transparent
plastics is constituted by a thin plastic film.
The composite stratified panel according to claim 1,characterized in that said first pane from transparent
plastics is a polycarbonate or polyester pane.
The composite stratified panel according to claim 1,characterized in that said second pane from transparent
plastics is a polycarbonate or polyester pane.
The composite stratified panel according to claim 1,characterized in that said film or sheet from
transparent plastics bearing said decoration is a

polyester film, such as polyethylene terephthalate
(PET).
The composite stratified panel according to claims 1
and 5, characterized in that said decoration on said

film or sheet from transparent plastics is realized'
with sublimable colors, by the transfer technique.
The composite stratified panel according to claim 1,characterized in that said glue or adhesive is selected
from polyvinylbutyrale (PVB) and polyurethane (PU).
The composite stratified panel according to claims 2
and 4, characterized in that a primer is interposed

between said film from polyester such as polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) and said glue or adhesive.
The composite stratified panel according to claim 1,characterized in that said decoration is realized by
means of photo-sensitive colorants, obtaining in this

way a decoration whose intensity and color change
according to the light conditions.
A process for the realization of a composite
stratified panel according to claim 1, characterized in

that it comprises the following steps:

application of a first layer of adhesive, such as
polyvinylbutyrale (PVB) or polyurethane (PU) on a first

pane from glass or transparent plastics;
coating a sheet or film from polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) decorated with sublimable colors on

said first pane;
application of a second pane from glass or
transparent plastics, also provided with a second

adhesive layer such as polyvinylbutyrale (PVB) or
polyurethane (PU), on said sheet or film from decorated

polyethylene terephthalate;
removal of air and possible air pockets from the so
obtained sandwich, placing said sandwich in an airtight

vacuum envelope;
submitting the so obtained sandwich to heat
lamination, at a temperature ranging from 80°C and

130°C, with pressures comprised between atmosphere
pressure and 20 bars.
The process according to claim 10, characterized in
that said sheet from decorated polyethylene

terephthalate (PET) is previously treated with a primer
of the silane, epoxy, acrylic or polyurethane type.
