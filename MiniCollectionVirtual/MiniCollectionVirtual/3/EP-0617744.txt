<ABSTRACT>
In the device described, a traction element (22) is joined to the yarn (6) to be controlled. A coupling (38) links the traction element (22) to a lifting device (32). The coupling (38) includes a link pin (40) which can reciprocate batween a neutral position and a coupling position and which works in conjunction with two piezoelectric switching elements (50, 52) each of which acts alternately as an actuator and a sensor. This not only ensures that the coupling construction is extremely simple but also enables the switching function of the coupling to be monitored, thus avoiding switching faults.
