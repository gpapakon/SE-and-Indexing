<ABSTRACT>
The slide bodies (40) have sections (42,44) of different radial thickness. The thicker section (44) radially opposes a radially thinner section (37) of an associated holder so that an interspace (45) is left free at this point in the radial direction between the sleeve faces (12, 22) of the support body (10) and of the flywheel ring (20). This interspace can only be overcome with increased radial load. In the first stage of the support a low normal force acts on the slide faces in the entire torsional active range of the shock absorber through the low radial force, and friction is kept very low. In the second phase after overcoming the radial interspace the radial stiffness of the entire support is increased.

<CLAIMS>
A torsional vibration damper, especially for the driving 
line of motor vehicles, comprising 


a carrier member (10) which has an outer shell surface (12) 
around a center axis, 
a rotating ring (20) which has an inner shell surface (22) 
radially spaced from the outer shell surface (12) of the carrier 

member (10) and disposed coaxially with the same, 
a plurality of segments (24) of rubber elastic material 

fastened to the two shell surfaces (12, 22), 
a plurality of retainers (30) of rubber elastic material 
fastened to one of the two shell surfaces (12), 
a plurality of slide elements (40) each fastened by a corresponding 
one of the retainers (30) to the one shell surface 

(12) and each having a slide surface (42') for sliding support 
on the other shell surface (22), 
the slide elements (40) including portions (42, 44) of different 
radial thickness, and 
at least one portion (42) of small radial thickness supported 
permanently on a portion (32) which is thick in radial 

direction of the corresponding retainer (30), 
characterized
 in 
that at least one portion (44) of the slide element (40) having 

the greater radial thickness is located radially opposite 
a portion (37) which is thinner in radial direction of the 

corresponding retainer (30) in such manner that a radial interval 
(45) remains free at the location of these portions 

(44, 37) between the shell surfaces (12, 22) of the carrier 
member (10) and the rotating ring (20), this interval being 

overcome only under increased radial load. 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in claim 1,
 
characterized in that 


the slide elements (40) are bridge shaped, as seen in a 
direction parallel to the center axis, having an arch which is 

formed with the sliding surface (42') and two trusses as portions  
 

(44) of greater radial thickness which are held in one 
of the retainers each, 
the arch, as the portion (42) of little radial thickness, 
being disposed substantially free of radial clearance, at 

least in a central region, between a middle piece (32) of the 
corresponding retainer (30) and the opposed shell surface 

(22), 
the bridge trusses and the adjacent parts of the retainer 
(30), on the other hand, being dimensioned such that the radial 

interval (45) between the retainer (30) and the slide 
element (40) is located in the area of each bridge truss. 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that the radial interval (45) is left free 

between a base area (44') each of the bridge trusses and the 
corresponding retainer (30). 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in claim 1 or 
2, characterized in that the radial interval (45) is left free 

between an end each of the sliding surface (42') of the slide 
element (40) and the corresponding shell surface (22). 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in claim 4, 
characterized in that the portion (42) of little radial thickness 

includes a central joint (50). 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in any one of 
claims 2 to 5, characterized in that radially within each arch 

there is at least one lubricant chamber (34) to which is 
connected a lubricant passage (46) leading substantially radially 

through the arch to the outside. 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in any one of 
claims 2 to 6, characterized in that the bridge trusses are of 

dovetail shape in cross section perpendicular to the axis. 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in any one of 
claims 2 to 6, characterized in that the retainers (30) each  

 
comprise a thrust bearing (36) which is elastic in circumferential 

direction and on which the corresponding truss is 
supported. 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the slide elements (40) are L shaped as 

seen in a direction parallel to the center axis. 
The torsional vibration damper as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that the slide elements (40) are T shaped as 

seen in a direction parallel to the center axis.
