<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a binding element, more
specifically to a binding element of the type of which
the inside of the back is provided with an amount of
glue which melts under the influence of heat.Binding elements of the above-mentioned type are widely
known. In order to bind a bundle of sheets or documents
by means of such binding element, the sheets are placed
in contact with the glue in the binding element.
Consecutively, the whole is placed vertically, the back
facing down, on a heating element, so that the glue
melts and the sheets intrude in the glue layer. After
the binding element has been taken off the heating
element, the glue hardens, with as a result that the
sheets are retained in the binding element by means of
the glue.In order to obtain that the heat of the heating element
is fed to the glue in an efficient way, more
specifically is spread very equally, it is also known to
apply an element of a heat conducting material, such as
metal, in the back.It is also known that the above-mentioned element can
consist of a metal U-shaped profile. An example thereof
is disclosed in GB 2.197.156. The use of such U-shaped
profile also offers the advantage that, when laying the
bound bundle open, respectively turning the pages
thereof, the glue connections between the sheets, as
well as the glue connections between the sheets
themselves, is burdened little or not at all, thus
avoiding that the sheets come loose. According to GB 2.197.156, the U-shaped profile is
located at the inside of the file. The binding element
therefore has the disadvantage that it is very
user-unfriendly, as it is very difficult to slide all
sheets into the U-shaped profile, especially with thick
bundles. Indeed, the outer sheets end up on the edge of
the relatively thick metal profile.The invention therefore aims at a binding element
whereby the above-mentioned disadvantage is excluded,
and more specifically at a binding element whereby said
heat conducting element, whether this has a U-shaped
section or not, does not trouble when inserting a bundle
of loose documents in this binding element. To this end the invention relates to a binding element,
consisting of a file which is composed of one or more
parts, the back of which contains an element in a hard and
heat conducting material, and whereby the back is provided
at its inside with an amount of glue which melts under the
infuence of heat, characterized in that the file shows one
or more portions overlapping, at least partially, the side
of said element which is
