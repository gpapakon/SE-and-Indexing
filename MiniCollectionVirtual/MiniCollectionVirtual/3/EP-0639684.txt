<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elongate structural member provided with
an attachment portion at each end for attachment to other elements. Such
members are widely used in buildings and the like as bracing elements, e.g. as
structural ties for roof structures, trusses, stanchions and space frames. Such a
structural member will hereinafter be referred to as a structural member of the
kind specified.It also relates to a method for providing such a structural member and a building comprising such members.A structural member of the kind specified has hitherto comprised a hot
rolled tube provided with an attachment portion at each end. Such members
made of hot rolled tube have generally been relatively expensive and heavy. They
are made by cutting to length from a stock length of tube of a diameter and wall
thickness which approximates as far as possible to that required for the structural
strength. However, because the tube is bought in standard sizes, the tube cross-sectional
dimensions cannot be tailored to each particular application. In
addition, the need to cut to length from a standard length generally leads to a
significant amount of waste.In addition, the steps of welding on a cap plate to each end of the tube
and a T-piece to provide the attachment portions is required followed by shot
blasting and painting.It is also known to provide an elongate structured member comprising
sheet metal components which have been cold formed into the shape required to
form a compound member having a generally "I" - shaped cross-section (GB
1476323 cf. the preamble of claim 1).An object of the present invention is to provide a structural member
of the kind specified whereby the abovementioned disadvantages are overcome
or reduced. According to aspect of the present invention we provide an
elongate structural member comprising an elongate body part made of sheet
metal which has been cold formed into the cross-sectional shape required and
provided with an attachment portion at each end, the member being of closed
hollow cross-sectional shape and characterised in that at least one attachment
portion comprises portions of the member displaced out of their original cross-sectional
positions into face-to-face relationship with one another and adjacent to
one another, the body part comprising wall portions having edge portions
extending lengthwise of the member and lying adjacent to one another, said edge
portions being secured to one another by fastening means provided at least at
spaced intervals along the members, the

An elongate structural member comprising an elongate body part made
of sheet metal which has been cold formed into the cross-sectional shape required

and provided with an attachment portion at each end, the member being of closed
hollow cross-sectional shape and characterised in that at least one attachment

portion comprises portions (16) of the member displaced out of their original
cross-sectional positions into face-to-face relationship with one another and

adjacent to one another, the body part comprising wall portions (21, 22, 104, 105)
having edge portions extending lengthwise of the member and lying adjacent to

one another, said edge portions being secured to one another by fastening means
provided at least at spaced intervals along the members, the attachment portion

being adapted (18) to co-operate with fasteners (38).
A member according to Claim 1 wherein the body part comprises a
unitary member (100) having a pair of side-by-side edge portions which are

secured together by said fastening means.
A member according to Claim 2 wherein the edge portions comprise
two flanges (106, 107) secured together in side-by-side relation.
A member according to Claim 3 wherein the flanges (106, 107) extend
outwardly relative to the interior of the closed cross-section (100).
A member according to Claim 1 wherein the body part is a compound
member, comprising two or more components (10) secured together, each

component affording part of the overall cross-section of the body part. 
A member according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 wherein said
fastening means comprises a weld or means mechanically interfitting with at least

one edge portion.
A member according to Claim 6 wherein said fastening means
comprises clip means (76) with both edge portions, or a formation or formations

on one edge portion (96) interfitting with the other edge portion (97).
A member according to Claim 7 wherein a pressing or like operation
or operations is perforates to deform the interfitting parts into a close-fitting

relationship.
A member according to Claim 1 or any of Claimss 3 to 8 where
wherein the body part is a compound member comprising two or more

components (10) secured together and, to provide the attachment portion at an
end of the structural member, portions (16) of each of said (10) components are

displaced out of their original cross-sectional positions into positions wherein they
will lie in face-to-face relationship to one another and adjacent to one another in

the member, prior to connection of the components to one another to form the
member.
A method of providing an elongate structural member comprising an
elongate body part having an attachment pportion at each end, comprising the

steps of cold forming sheet metal into the cross-sectional shape required for the
body part such that the member is of closed hollow cross-sectional shape,

characterised in that the method comprises the furhter steps of displacing portions
of the member out of their original cros
s-sectional positions into face-to-face
relationship with one another and adjacent to one another, two elongate member

having wall portions having edge portions according lengthwise of the member 
and lying adjacent to one another, securing said edge portions and providing

means for co-operation of said attachment portion with fasteners.
A building structure comprising two spaced apart elements (140)
having a structural member according to any one of Claims 1 to 9 or made

according to Claim 10.
