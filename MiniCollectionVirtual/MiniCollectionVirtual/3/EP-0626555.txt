<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the present invention is that of practice munitions and practice missiles (projectiles). The missile according to the invention is characterised in that it comprises a body (2) formed by the assembly of several sectors (3) and a case (5) having a housing (6) intended to receive the various sectors, the sectors (3) being produced from a plastic, the missile including means which hold the assembly of sectors (3) together during the handling phases, means designed so as to release the sectors as the missile leaves the tube of a weapon when fired. Application to medium-calibre practice munitions.

<CLAIMS>
A practice projectile (1) comprising a body (2) 
formed by assembling several segments (3) and a base (5) 

having a housing (6) designed to accommodate these 
segments, characterised in that the segments are made of a 

thermo-plastic type material and in that it comprises 
means to hold the segment (3) assembly together during the 

handling phases, means designed so as to free the segments 
upon exiting from the barrel of a weapon during firing of 

the projectile. 
A projectile according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the holding means comprise a nose cap (15) 

surrounding a front part of the projectile (1). 
A projectile according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the nose cap (15) has a flange (16) which penetrates 

into a ring-shaped groove (17) arranged on the segments 
(3) thereby fastening the nose cap to the latter. 
A projectile according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the holding means comprise a sleeve (14) surrounding 

a front part of the projectile (1), a sleeve made of a 
heat-shrinkable material. 
A projectile according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the holding means comprise at least 

one protrusion (18) integral with a segment and working in 
conjunction with a groove (19) arranged on a contiguous 

segments to the previous one, a groove of a matching shape 
to that of the protrusion. 
A projectile according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the holding means comprise a central 

section (20) formed in a single piece with at least t
<
o 
segments evenly distributed at an angle and forming a 

first group of segments. 
A projectile according to Claim 6, characterised in 
that the first group of segments marks out housing (21) in 

which the other segments are placed, the latter, which 
form a second group of segments, being joined to the 

former by means of a nose cap (15).  
 
A projectile according to Claim 7, characterised in 
that the second group of segments is formed in a single 

piece with the nose cap (15). 
A projectile according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the holding means comprise at least one spot weld 

(12) between two contiguous segments (3). 
A projectile according to Claim 9, characterised 
in that the segments (3) are welded two by two along their 

outer contact edges (23). 
A production process for a projectile according to 
Claim 10, characterised by the following steps : 


the segments (3) are grouped together so as to form 
the projectile body, 
at least a front section (2a) of the projectile body 
is placed in a tooling (26) designed to heat its outer 

surface to a high enough temperature to make the 
constitutive material of the segments (3) melt locally and 

weld them along their outer contact edges (23), 
the body (2) is cooled, 
the projectile body (2) and the base (5) are 
assembled. 
A production process according to Claim 11, 
characterised in that the various segments (3) are made in 

a single operation by casting and are joined together in a 
star shape by their tips.
