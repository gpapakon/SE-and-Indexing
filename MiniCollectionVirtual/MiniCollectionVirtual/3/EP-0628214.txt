<DESCRIPTION>
 MANUFACTURE OF ETCHED SUBSTRATES SUCH AS INFRARED DETECTORSThis invention relates to methods of etch manufacturing elements such as infrared detector elements, in which at least one narrow aperture is etched in a substrate or body. The body may comprise an infrared-sensitive material, particularly but not exclusively, cadmium mercury telluride. However, it is also recognised by the applicants that such an etching process may be applied to other electronic devices, for example those comprising other semiconductor materials.For many years it has been known to use buffered chemical (iÎµotropic) etchants in the manufacture of electronic devices, including semiconductor devices and infrared detectors. Published United Kingdom patent specification GB-A-1 559 473 describes the manufacture of infrared detector elements of cadmium mercury telluride in which separate body portions are formed for each element by etching slot-shaped apertures through cadmium mercury telluride bodies mounted on a temporary support. On the bodies, an etchant resistant mask of photoresist is provided having windows where the slots are to be etched. In a 

particular embodiment, the width of the slots is 30um (micrometers) as finally etched through bodies which themselves have a thickness of 8um. It is noted that, even if the thickness of the bodies is reduced to 6um, it is not readily possible to achieve a separation of less than 12um using such an etchant treatment- For this reason, the separate detector elements defined by this etching treatment in the embodiment of GB-A-1 559 473 are formed on a temporary support from which they are subsequently removed and assembled, with a closer separation, on a substrate of the detector device.The present invention is based on a recognition that, by using non-buffered etchants and by constraining the etchant flow in the window, narrow and deep apertures can be formed. Thus, the present invention employs a type of preferential (non-isotropic) etching whereby the etchant in a mask window etches at a faster rate adjacent to the side-walls of the mask.According to the present invention, there is provided a method of etching a substrate to form a narrow trough of predetermined width therein, the method comprising the steps of marking said substrate with an etch resistant mark having a thickness, said mark including an aperture in register 

with a location whereat the trough is to be formed, said mask aperture being defined by facing side-walls of height equal to said mask thickness, etching said

 CLAIMS
1. A method of etching a substrate to form a narrow trough of predetermined width therein, the method comprising the steps of marking said substrate with an etch resistant mark having a thickness, said mark including an aperture in register with a location whereat the trough is to be formed, said mask aperture being defined by facing side-walls of height equal to said mask thickness, etching said substrate through said aperture with a non-isotropic etchant providing, adjacent said side-walls, areas of faster etching, and further including the step of forming said mask aperture with said side-walls so spaced that said areas overlap-
2. A method according to claim 1 including the step of controlling the thickness of said mask so that said side-walls are of height sufficient to constrain flow of etchant to ensure said areas of faster etching overlap.
3. A method according to claim 2 wherein said side-wall height is greater than the side-wall spacing.
4. A method according to claim 2 including the step 


of further constraining the flow of etchant with a pad, said substrate and mask being supported in an inverted manner over said pad and being spaced therefrom by spacers, said etchant being provided on said pad between said spacers.
5. A method according to claim 1 wherein the substrate is a semiconductor.
6. A method according to claim 5 wherein the semiconductor is an infrared sensitive material.
7. A method according to claim 6 wherein the infrared sensitive material is Cadmium Mercury Telluride.
8. A method according to claim 1 wherein the etchant is a strong solution of bromine in an alcohol.
9. A method according to claim 8 wherein the alcohol is ethylene glycol.
10. A method according to claim 1 wherein the trough is etched to a depth equal to the thickness of the substrate.
11. A method of manufacturing an infrared detector 


having at least one aperture etched in a body comprising infrared-sensitive material, which method includes the steps of (a) providing on the body an etchant resistant mask having a window where the aperture is to be etched, the mask having facing side-walls at the window, and (b) subjecting the infrared-sensitive material of the body via the window to an etchant which etches at a faster rate adjacent to the side-walls of the mask, wherein the facing side-walls are sufficiently close to each other that the flow of the etchant within the window is constrained by these facing side-walls of the mask and that the areas of faster etching at the facing side-walls overlap within the window to form a narrow and deep aperture in the body adjacent to the window.
12. A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein at the window the mask has a thickness larger than the close spacing of the facing side-walls.
13. A method as claimed in claim 11 wherein the flow of the etchant to and from the window of the mask is constrained by the body being mounted on the underside of a support over a pad on which the etchant is present, the support having a spacer on its underside to determine the thickness of a narrow etchant-filled gap between the pad and the body. 


 14. A .method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the infrared-sensitive material is cadmium mercury telluride, the body of which is present on a substrate of the detector, and the aperture is etched through the thickness of the body to the substrate.
15. A method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the etchant comprises a fresh strong solution of bromine in ethylene glycol.
16. A method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the window is of elongate geometry, and the aperture formed by the etching via this window is a slot which separates two neighbouring portions of the body.
17. A method as claimed in claim 11, wherein the aperture produced by the etching step (b) has a width which is less than twice its depth.
