<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to removable pressure-sensitive
adhesives and more particularly to water
resistant, removable acrylic emulsion pressure-sensitive
adhesives for use with plasticized polyvinyl
chloride and other film facestocks.Removable pressure-sensitive adhesives are used on
a variety of products including labels, tapes, films,
and the like, to enable the product to adhere to a
substrate and then to later be removed from the
substrate without difficulty and without leaving a
stain or residue. Currently, commercially available
acrylic emulsion removable pressure-sensitive adhesives
cannot be used with film facestocks such as plasticized
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) which are used in outdoor
applications. Such outdoor applications include
decorative decals which are applied to substrates such
as glass. The typical technique for applying such a
decorative decal to a substrate is to spray water on
the adhesive and/or substrate so that the decal is
slidingly movable over the substrate for ease of
positioning. Unfortunately, in such a technique, the
acrylic emulsion adhesive film turns milky in contact 
with water. For transparent filmstocks, this results
in an undesirable appearance.For a successful acrylic emulsion removable
pressure-sensitive adhesive to be used with decorative
films and decals in outdoor applications, the adhesive
should exhibit good water resistance along with good
anchorage of the adhesive to the film facestock to
assure clean removability from the substrate. The only
current commercially available acrylic emulsion
pressure-sensitive adhesives which demonstrate good
water resistance are permanent adhesives, i.e. those
that leave an adhesive residue on the substrate if the
facestock is removed. Currently available removable
acrylic emulsion pressure-sensitive adhesives which
demonstrate good anchorage to the film also exhibit
poor water resistance. Accordingly, there is a need
for a removable acrylic emulsion pressure-sensitive
adhesive which combines both good water resistance and
good anchorage to the film facestock.The present invention provides a removable acrylic
emulsion pressure-sensitive adhesive which demonstrates
good water resistance and good anchorage to the
facestock. The adhesives of the present invention are
particularly adapted for use on plastic film
facestocks, particularly PVC.The pressure-sensitive adhesives comprise acrylic
emulsion polymers including from 85 to 97%
by weight alkyl acrylate monomers having from 1 to
12 and preferably from about 4 to about 8
