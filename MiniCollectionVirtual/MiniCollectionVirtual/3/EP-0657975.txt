<ABSTRACT>
A distributed feedback semiconductor laser 
selectively performs one of two oscillations in 

different polarization modes having different 
polarization planes. The laser includes a subtrate, 

a light waveguide formed on the substrate, which 
at least partially includes an active layer, a 

a diffraction grating formed around the waveguide, 
and an injecting unit for injecting a modulation current 

into a portion of the waveguide. The waveguide and the 
grating are constructed such that oscillation 

wavelengths of the polarization modes are 
different from each other and minimum values of 

threshold gain in the polarization modes near the Bragg 
wavelength are approximately equal to each other. 

The semiconductor laser can be driven by a minute 
modulation current and prevents degradation of 

response characteristics due to dynamic wavelength 
fluctuation in a high-frequency range when used in 

optical communication systems in which the switching of 
polarization mode is performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
laser suitable for use as a light source apparatus
in the field of optical frequency division
multiplexing (FDM) communications, for example,
and further relates to an optical communication
system and a light source apparatus which
use the above-mentioned semiconductor laser,
respectively.In recent years, increased transmission
capacity in the field of optical communications has
become desirable, and the development of optical FDM
communications, in which signals at a plurality of
optical frequencies are multiplexed in a single optical
fiber, has been advanced.There are two kinds of optical FDM communication
methods, which are classified by the type of light signal used
in the receiving technique. One method is a coherent optical
communication, in which a beat signal is produced between
signal light and light from a local oscillator to obtain 
an intermediate-frequency output, and that output is
detected. The other method is one, in which only light
at a desired wavelength or optical frequency is selected
by a tunable filter, and the thus-selected light is
detected. The tunable filter used in the latter method
may comprise one of a Max-Zehnder type, a fiber
Fabry-Perot type, an acousto-optic (AO) modulator type,
a semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) filter type
and the like. Especially, in the semiconductor DFB
filter type, the transmission bandwidth can be
narrowed down to less than 0.5 Å and the optical
amplification function (approx. 20 dB) exists, so the
multiplicity of transmission wavelengths of signals can
be increased and the minimum receiving sensitivity
can be improved (i. e. , the minimum receiving intensity
can be reduced). An example of a semiconductor type
filter is disclosed in T. Numai et al. "Semiconductor
Tunable Wavelength Filter", OQE 88-65, 1988. Further,
since this type of filter can be formed with the same
material as a semiconductor photodetector, integration and
downsizing are feasible. From the foregoing, the
suitability of a semiconductor DFB type optical filter
for optical FDM communications is clear.On the other hand, in an optical communication
system using a semiconductor filter as a light
source in an optical transmitter, the semiconductor
laser is required to have stable oscillation and 
polarization direction and to maintain a dynamic single
mode. Therefore, as a semiconductor laser, DFB laser,
distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser, or the like is
used since they radiate only in the transverse electric
(TE) mode.
