<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for positioning antennae including an assembly (130) with an antenna-support mast (131) mounted movably in a reserved area (104) formed between a special-purpose absorbing wall (110) of the measurement chamber (103) and the adjacent wall of the envelope (101) of this chamber; the mast (131) passes through this special-purpose wall (110) via an associated slot (105) so as to extend within the measurement chamber (103), each antenna (50, 51) being mounted so as to slide along the mast (131), without mechanical interference with the other antennae carried by the mast, so as to be able to position the desired antenna at the required site while withdrawing the other antenna or the other antennae into the reserved area (104), behind the abovementioned special-purpose wall.
