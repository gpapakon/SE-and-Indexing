<ABSTRACT>
In a method of coextruding a multi-layered food 
product, a plurality of different food materials are fed 

via a distributor means (4A,4B,5) to an extrusion 
assembly having a multiplicity of juxtaposed channels 

(2A to 2F) which merge to form a common outlet. The 
plurality of different food materials are fed to 

respective inlets of the distributor means from where 
they p
ass through the distributor means into the channels 
(2A to 2F) of the extrusion assembly. The food material 

fed to at least one of the inlets of the distributor 
means passes from there through the distributor means 

into two or more channels, the two or more channels being 
spaced apart from one another by one or more other 

channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for
extruding a plurality of different food materials to form
a multi-layered food product, for example, a
confectionery item.Extrusion is already used in the food industry to
produce a single-layered product. It has also been
proposed, for example, in GB 773,404, to coextrude three
ribbons of ice cream of different colours or flavours.
In that case of course the viscosity of the material in
each layer is substantially the same and is relatively
low, thus facilitating extrusion. Also each individual
layer in a typical three-layer ice cream product is
relatively thick (more than 1 cm thick). In GB 773,404
the different colours or flavours of ice cream are fed
from different reservoirs through different impellers to
different channels of the extrusion apparatus.Where, however, it is desired to form a multi-layered
product with layers of contrasting texture
coextrusion has generally not been the chosen method.
For example, in GB 2 108 363 a multi-layered ice
confection product is formed by extruding individual
layers through respective extruders and spraying food
material (chocolate) onto the surface of each extruded
layer before that surface is covered by the next layer. 
Similarly, GB 1 261 729 describes a method of
manufacturing a confectionery product such as liquorice
in which sheets of different food materials (liquorice
paste and sugar paste) are formed by extrusion of the
individual sheets and the sheets are then placed on top
of one another to form a multi-layered assembly.A problem with arrangements of the kind just
described is that they require an undue amount of
machinery which, when suitably arranged, takes up a large
amount of space, especially when the final product is
required to have many layers.Further examples of prior art include US 4,781,929,
EP 0 128 963 and GB 2 220 164.US 4,781,929 describes a composite food product and
an apparatus for producing such a food product. The
apparatus comprises a central nozzle fed with one type of
food material and two outer nozzles fed with another type
of material. The food materials are co-extruded through
the respective nozzles to form a three-layered food
product.EP 0 128 963 describes an apparatus for producing
and packaging a multi-layered food product. Five
compartments are filled with food materials, the two
outer compartments and central compartment being filled
via three respective pipes with one type of food material
and the two other compartments being filled via two
respective pipes with a

different food materials to an extrusion assembly (6)

juxtaposed channels merge at a common outlet, and the
