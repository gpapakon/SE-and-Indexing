<ABSTRACT>
A seal is described comprising a ring (17) of a resilient 
material intended to be pressed between two parallel, preferably 

flat sealing surfaces (13,16). 
Said seal is preferably intended to be a part of a filtra­
tion and/or diffusion device, comprising a bundle (1) of hollow 

fibers arranged longitudinally within a housing (2) with the 
fiber ends embedded in two end walls (3) and with one sealing 

ring (17) being positioned between the outside (13) of one or 
both said end walls (3) and a lid (14) having an inlet and/or an 

outlet (15) for a liquid intended to flow through the hollow 
fibers of the bundle. 
Said device is preferably intended to be used for dialysis, 
hemofiltration or hemodiafiltration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a seal comprising a ring of 
a resilient material intended to be pressed between two parallel, 
preferably flat sealing surfaces. The seal according to the present invention is preferably 
intended to be a part of a filtration and/or diffusion device 
according to for instance any of the Swedish patents       
(SE appl 87.03366-8) and 454 847 (SE appl 87.03368-4), i e a 
device comprising a bundle of hollow fibers arranged longitud­
inally within a housing with the fiber ends embedded in two end 
walls and with the sealing ring being positioned between the 
outside of one or both said end walls and a lid having an inlet 
and/or an outlet for a liquid intended to flow through the hollow 
fibers of the bundle. In connection with devices of this kind, special advantages 
will be achieved by using seals according to the present 
invention. For the man skilled in the art it will, however, be 
ovbious that seals of this kind also may be used advantageously 
for many other purposes. In the above mentioned patents, some different filtration 
and/or diffusion devices are disclosed, all having a sealing ring 
in the form of an O-ring arranged between an end wall and a cup-­
shaped lid. In practice it has, however, been found that it is 
very difficult by means of such an O-ring to provide exactly the 
desired tightening pressure. This is especially true when the lid  
 
is to be welded to the housing of the device. In order to get the 
desired tightening pressure, the lid has to be placed in a 
special position as regards the housing within very narrow 
limits. One object of the present invention is to solve the above 
problem which we believe is common for many different technical 
fields. The problem is solved in that the sealing ring is given 
a special form characterized in that the dimension of the ring 
perpendicularly to the two parallel surfaces is larger than the 
dimension parallel to said surface and that it is given such a 
form that it is bent in a certain direction in its sealing 
position. Alternatively it may be said that the ring is given such a 
form that it by the compression quickly reaches a knicking or 
bending position from which the compression forces increases 
slowly compared with the initial state of the compression, 
eventually reaching a position from which the compression forces 
once again increases more rapidly. By such a construction you may move the lid as regards the 
housing in a device of the above described kind within wide 
limits and still

<CLAIMS>
1. A seal comprising a ring (17) of a resilient material 
intended to be pressed between two parallel, preferably flat 

sealing surfaces (13,16), characterized in that the dimension of 
the ring (17) perpendicular to the two parallel surfaces (13,16) 

is larger than the dimension parallel to said surfaces and that 
it is given such a form that it is bent in a certain direction in 

its sealing position. 
2. A seal according to claim 1, characterized in that it 
includes beside said two parallel sealing surfaces (13,16) a 

third sealing surface (19), which is perpendicular to the other 
sealing surfaces and encloses the ring (17). 
3. A seal according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
transverse section of the ring (17) is given such a form that it 

is directing a concave surface against said third sealing surface 
(19) in its sealing position. 
4. A seal according to any of the preceding claims, charac­
terized in that the transverse section of the ring (17) has the 

form of a boomerang or a C-form before it is compressed, the 
concave side of the ring being directed outwardly against said 

third sealing surface (19). 
5. A seal according to claim 4, characterized by an 
indentation (20) on the convex side of the ring, having such a 

form that said side (21) of the ring will get an essential flat 
form perpendicular to the two first mentioned sealing surfaces 

(13,16). 
6. A seal according to any of the preceding claims, being a 
part of a filtration and/or diffusion device, comprising a bundle 

(1) of hollow fibers arranged longitudinally within a housing (2) 
with the fiber ends embedded in two end walls (3), characterized 

in that one sealing ring (17) is positioned between the outside 
of one or both said end walls (3) and a lid (14) having an inlet 

and/or an outlet (15) for a liquid intended to flow through the 
hollow fibers of the bundle. 
7. A seal according to claim 6, characterized in that the 
lid or lids (14) has/have a cup-form with a flange which covers 

the outside of the ends of the housing (2). 
8. A seal according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
lid (14) is tightly welded or glued to the housing (2). 
9. A seal according to claim 7, characterized in that the 
lid (14) has a screw connectio
n (18a) with the housing (2). 
10. A seal according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that the resilient ring (17) is made of rubber 

or a similar elastic material. 
11. A seal according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that it is a part of a filtration and/or 

diffusion device according to any of the Swedish patents       
(SE appl 87.03366-8) and 454 847 

(SE appl 87.03368-4). 
12. A seal comprising a ring (17) of a resilient material 
intended to be pressed between two parallel, preferably flat 

sealing surfaces (13-16), characterized in that the ring (17) has 
such a form that it by the compression quickly reaches a knicking
