<ABSTRACT>
An improved method is disclosed for purging a vacuum 
chamber suitable for use in the production of integrated 

circuit structures on semiconductor wafers. The method 
comprises providing the chamber (4) to be purged and 

flowing a heated, non-reactive gas, such as argon gas, 
through the chamber (4). The non-reactive gas is heated to 

a temperature of at least 90°C. Further, the chamber (4) is 
heated to maintain it at a temperature of at least 90°C 

while flowing the gas therethrough. Flowing the heated non-reactive 

gas through the chamber (4) causes released 
impurities or contaminants to be efficiently swept from the 

chamber (4) in the non-reactive gas flow. After flowing the 
heated gas through the heated chamber (4), the flow of gas 

is interrupted and the chamber (4), while still hot, is 
pumped down to a vacuum of about 667 x 10
-7
 Pa (5 x 10
-7
 
Torr) to determine whether or not the chamber (4) has a 

leakage problem. The presence of a leakage problem may be 
determined by comparing the pumping to past pumping of 

similar sized chambers, or by measuring the partial 
pressure of common gases such as nitrogen and/or oxygen. If 

the partial pressure of oxygen is higher than about 667 x 
10
-8
 Pa (5 x 10
-8
 Torr) and the partial pressure of 
nitrogen is higher than 267 x 10
-7
 Pa (2 x 10
-7
 Torr), the 
vacuum chamber (4) can be considered to have a leakage 

problem. Pumping times may, therefore, be shortened by the 
use of such screening for leakage problems while the vacuum 

chamber (4) is still hot.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the purging and pumping of a vacuum chamber, and more
particularly to a method of pumping to ultra-high vacuum, a vacuum chamber suitable
for use in the manufacture of integrated circuit structures.In the prior art, considerable effort has been devoted to providing ultra-high vacuum
capability in thin film processing equipment, for example, for use in the formation
of integrated circuit structures on semiconductor wafers. Ultra-high vacuum is
important for obtaining and sustaining low levels of contamination during production
of the integrated circuit structures. However, in pumping to ultra-high vacuum, for
example, when PVD processing is practiced, it is important to minimize the period
of time required because such time is non-production time. Further, when testing
vacuum chamber equipment for ultra-high vacuum, it is desirable to predict the
integrity of the vacuum chamber during the pump to ultra-high vacuum levels to avoid
wasted pumping time.Various methods have been used for purging or decontaminating vacuum systems,
including electropolishing, baking at elevated temperatures, photon-stimulated
desorption and glow discharge cleaning using oxygen or noble gas. However, these
approaches are not without problems. For example, baking is time consuming
because a molecule released from a surface in the chamber is not efficiently removed
to the chamber exit. Upon release, the desorbed molecule can take what is referred
to as a random path where it can strike other surfaces in the chamber with the chance
of becoming readsorbed. On the other hand, glow discharge cleaning can result in
further contamination by absorption of the cleaning gases into the chamber surfaces. These gases are emitted later which leads to contamination. Also, it has been
reported that glow discharge cleaning may not be uniform, particularly in complicated
chamber geometry.Other systems have been reported which can reach ultra-high vacuum in a matter of
minutes. Such systems employ expensive mirror finishes to minimize contaminants
and water adsorption, glow-discharge cleaning using super-dry nitrogen gas, and
double turbomolecular pumps. However, fabrication of such systems is very costly
and, accordingly, would be impractical.In the AIP Conference Proceedings of the Topical
