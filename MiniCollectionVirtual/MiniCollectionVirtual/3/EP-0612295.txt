<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a poppet valve connected to a key member which retains a 
control valve in the bore of a vacuum brake booster. In brake systems having boosters to assist in operating a master cylinder to supply 
wheel brakes with pressurized fluid, it is common practice to utilize a pressure differential 
created between vacuum produced by the operation of an internal combustion engine and 
presented to a first chamber in the booster and air of the surrounding environment presented to 
a second chamber. The development of the pressure differential occurs in response to an input 
applied to move a control valve which initially interrupts communication of vacuum between 
first and second chambers and thereafter allows air to flow to the second chamber to produce 
the pressure differential across a movable output wall corresponding to the input force. U.S. 
Patent 3,279,327 discloses this well known manner for the operation of a vacuum brake 
booster wherein the hub which carries the control valve has a bore which is connected to the 
first and second chambers. A plunger of the control valve moves past a vacuum port in the 
bore to interrupt communication between the bore and second chamber and thereafter a 
vacuum port is opened to allow air to be communicated to the second chamber for the 
development of the desired pressure differential. In an effort to reduce the time required to effect a brake application, a control valve, of 
the type illustrated in U.S. Patent 3,289,547 was developed to control the development of the 
operational pressure differential. In this type control valve, the passageway for communication 
of vacuum between a first chamber and bore was relocated and a vacuum seat for the control 
valve was created in the bore. A poppet member of the control valve was located in the bore 
and connected to the input push rod attached to the brake pedal. Movement of a plunger 
connected to the push rod allowed a spring to move the poppet member into engagement with 
the vacuum seat to immediately interrupt communication of vacuum through the bore to the 
second chamber. Thereafter, further movement of the plunger of the control valve allowed air 
to be presented through the bore to the second chamber where a pressure differential 
corresponding to a desired braking force is created.. This type of control valve performs in an 
adequate manner to meet most brake applications. U.S. Patent 5,029,515 discloses a brake booster having a first valve activated in 
response to an input force and

<CLAIMS>
In a brake booster (10) having first valve means (50) and second valve means 
(92) located in a bore (30) in a hub (28), said first valve means (50) cooperating with key 

means (64) connected with said hub (28), said key means (64) engaging stop means (15) of the 
booster (10) as said hub moves during a brake release to interrupt fluid communication 

between a first chamber (18) and a second chamber (20) in the brake booster (10) when said 
hub (28) reaches a rest position, said second valve means (92) being characterized by being 

carried by said key means (64) and engaging a seat (33) of said hub (28) to effect said fluid 
communication interruption between said first (18) and second chambers (20). 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 1 wherein said second valve means 
(92) further being characterized by poppet means attached to said key means (64). 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 2 wherein said hub (28) is 
characterized by a cylindrical body (29) having a peripheral slots (36) located thereon, a first 

passageway (32) for directly connecting said first chamber (18) to said second chamber (20) 
and a second passageway (38) connecting said second chamber (20) to the surrounding 

environment through said bore (30), said seat (33) being located on said hub (28) surrounding 
said first passageway (32). 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 3 wherein said key means (64) is 
characterized by a clip (82) connected to said hub (28) for urging said poppet means (92) 

toward said seat (33) to seal said first passageway (32) during a brake apply. 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 4 wherein said key means (64) is 
further characterized by a plurality of projections (78,80) that snap into a slot in said hub (28) 

to maintain said poppet means (92) aligned with said first passageway (32). 
In a brake booster (10) having valve means (50,92) retained in a bore (30) of a 
hub (28) by key means (64), said key means (64) on engaging stop means (15) of the brake 

booster (10) holding said valve means (92) stationary while said hub (28) moves toward a rest 
position during a brake release to change the fluid communication relationship between a first 

chamber (18) and a second chamber (20) from unrestricted to restricted, said valve means 
being characterized by poppet means (92) connected to said key means (64) for engaging a 

seat (33) of a direct passageway through said hub (28) between said first (18) and second (20) 
chambers to effect said restricted fluid communication. 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 6 wherein said key means (64) is 
characterized by a clip (82) connected to said hub (28) for urging said poppet means (92) into 

engagement with said seat (33) during a brake application to effect restricted fluid 
communication between said first (18) and second (20) chambers. 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 7 wherein said key means (64) is 
further characterized by a disc (66) having a yoke (72) which surrounds a groove (58) in a 

plunger (52) of said valve means (50,92), said yoke (72) engaging a land on said plunger (52) 
to limit the axial movement of said plunger (52) in said bore (30).  

 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 8 wherein said disc (66) is further 
characterized by a plurality of projections (78,80) which are located in corresponding slots on 

said hub (28) to align said poppet means (92) with said seat (33) surrounding said passageway 
(32). 
In the brake booster (10) as recited in claim 9 wherein said poppet means (92) 
is characterized by a resilient button (92) located on said disc (66) having a semi-spherical face 

(96) which engages said seat (33) to interrupt communication through said passageway (32).
