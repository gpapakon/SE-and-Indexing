<ABSTRACT>
Dispensing mechanism (10) includes a plurality of storage containers (12), each container having two or more metering pumps (46, 48) associated therewith. The containers and metering pumps are located on a turntable (14) which is indexed to move a particular metering pump to a dispensing station. Automated dispensing equipment (70) operates the metering pump at the dispensing station and the turntable is thereafter indexed a smaller amount to bring the other pump associated with the same container into a dispensing position. In this manner, a single actuator system can be employed for multiple discharge cycles associated with a particular canister, and can accommodate multiple canisters.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to dispensing 
apparatus for livid and pulverulent materials, and 
more particularly to such apparatus which is suitable 
for automated operation. Automated dispensing apparatus for 
pulverulent materials, such as food flavorings, 
chemical additives, paints, paint colorants and inks, 
for example, are becoming increasingly popular. 
Automatic dispensing machines have been developed for 
dispensing a plurality of different materials into a 
common container. These systems typically employ 
separate independent sources of material to be 
dispensed, with individual discharge mechanisms 
associated with their respective materials. Examples of such apparatus are disclosed in 
commonly assigned United States Letters Patent Nos. 
4,967,938 and 5,078,302. Formulations are stored in a 
digital computer or similar control device. Valve 
operating and pump operating equipment is provided at a 
dispensing station, located at a point adjacent a 
turntable carrying containers which hold the different 
materials. The valve operating and pump operating 
equipment is coupled to the computer. An operator 
selects a particular formula (e.g., by name) from a 
list of formulas stored in the computer. When the 
formulation is identified, the computer indicates the 
first canister to be selected. For example, when the 
material being dispensed is a coloring, such as a tint  
 
for a paint base, the computer identifies which color 
tint is to be dispensed first. The container may simply be identified on an 
output device, such as a cathode ray tube, with the 
system pausing until confirmation by the operator that 
the particular canister is in the desired position, or 
alternatively, the control system may index the 
turntable automatically, to bring the canister to the 
dispensing station. An example of a semi-automatic 
dispensing apparatus in which the turntable is manually 
indexed by an operator is described in commonly 
assigned United States Letters Patent No. 5,119,973. 
When the container is in place, the computer then 
directs the valve operator to open necessary valves for 
a dispensing operation and to prepare the pump operator 
for a pumping stroke. Under computer control, the pump 
associated with each container is operated so as to 
discharge an amount called for by the selected formula. 
After the pumping operation is completed, the computer 
calls for closing of the necessary valves, and the 
cycle is repeated for a second container (e.g., a 
second color tint to be added to the

Apparatus for dispensing a target amount 
of a material to a receptacle, comprising: 


at least one material source for holding the 
material to be dispensed; 
at least two discharge means coupled to said 
at least one material source and operable by an 

actuator means, for discharging from said at least one 
material source, preselected different amounts of 

material, each less than said target amount; 
actuator means for actuating said discharge 
means in response to a command signal; 
movable support means carrying said discharge 
means to and from said actuator means; 
drive means for moving said movable support 
means so as to carry preselected ones of said discharge 

means to said actuator means in response to a drive 
signal; and 
control means coupled to said actuator means 
for sending said command signal thereto and further 

coupled to said drive means for sending said drive 
signal thereto, said control means operable: to send a 

first drive signal to said drive means so as to carry 
one of said discharge means to said actuator means, to 

send a first command signal to discharge a first 
preselected amount of material, less than said target 

amount, therefrom, to thereafter send a second drive 
signal to said drive means so as to move said movable 

support means so as to carry the other of said 
discharge means to said actuator means and to send a 

second command signal to said actuator means to 
discharge a different preselected amount of material, 

less than said target amount, therefrom so that the 
amounts of material dispensed combine to achieve the 

target amount with an improved accuracy. 
The apparatus of claim 1 comprising a 
plurality of material sources, each containing a 

material to be dispensed at a dispensing station where 
said actuator means is located; and multiple sets of 

discharge means coupled to respective material sources, 
each set containing a larger and a smaller discharge 

means. 
The apparatus of claim 2 wherein said sets 
of discharge means are spaced apart on said movable 

support means with a preselected minimum spacing, and 
the discharge means of each set are spaced apart from 

one another with a smaller spacing. 
The apparatus of claim 3 wherein said 
control means, for each dispensing operation, issues a 

first drive signal to move a preselected set of 
discharge means to said dispensing station with one of 

said larger and said smaller discharge means positioned 
at the dispensing station, and after issuing a command 

signal to said actuator means, issues a second drive 
signal to position the other of said larger and said 

smaller discharge means at the dispensing station to 
complete the dispensing operation. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said 
discharge means comprise metering pumps. 
The apparatus of claim 5 wherein said 
metering pumps have multiple parts telescopically 

movable with respect to each other and said actuator 
means displaces at least one said part with a 

telescopic movement.  
 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein each 
discharge means is coupled to a respective material 

source. 
The apparatus of claim 1 wherein said 
movable support means comprises a turntable, and said 

sets of discharge means are angularly displaced from 
one another by at least a first amount, with angular 

displacements measured from the center of the 
turntable. 
The apparatus of claim 8 wherein said 
discharge means of each set are angularly displaced 

from one another, with smaller angular displacements 
also measured from the center of the turntable, which 

are smaller than the first amount.
