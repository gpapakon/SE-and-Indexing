<ABSTRACT>
There is described a warmed food server (11) with a housing (13) which has a cutout (19) for receiving at least one food-serving container (21) for food which is to be kept warm and is normally ready-cooked and a heating means in the form of a hot plate(s) (23) for heating the serving container (21). The hot plate(s) (23), which is arranged under the serving container (21), is height-adjustable and may be a radiant hot plate(s) or a hot plate(s) with electrical resistance, induction or halogen-light heating means. Owing to the height-adjustability of the hot plate(s) (23), food-serving containers (21) of varying depth can be used in the warmed food server (11), since the distance between hot plate(s) (23) and serving container (21) can be continuously adjusted to the optimum value in order to be able to keep the food at a specified serving temperature over a long period of time with little expenditure of energy.
