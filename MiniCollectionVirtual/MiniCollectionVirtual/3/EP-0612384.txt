<ABSTRACT>
A torsional damper for a lock-up clutch (4) comprises two coaxial parts (40, 50) mutually mobile against circumferentially acting springs (50). Said coaxial parts consist of an input part forming a guide disc (40) and an output part (60) or plate in which the guide disc (40) has a retaining portion (42, 142...) and support portions (45, 145...) to both retain the springs (50) externally and provide a support for them. The plate (60) also has support portions (65, 165...) to provide a support for the springs (60). Said plate (60) has a retaining portion (61, 161...) in the form of a half-shell. Said retaining portion of the plate (60) carries said support portions of said plate (60), and said retaining portions of the guide disc (40) and the plate (60) are mutually offset axially. Application to motor vehicles.
