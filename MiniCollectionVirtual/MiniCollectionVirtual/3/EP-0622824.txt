<ABSTRACT>
A photomultiplier includes a photocathode and an 
electron multiplier. A typical structure of the electron 

multiplier is obtained such that a dynode unit 
constituted by stacking a plurality of dynode plates in 

the incident direction of photoelectrons, an anode plate, 
and an inverting dynode plate are stacked. The anode 

plate (5) has electron through holes at a predetermined 
portion to cause secondary electrons emitted from the 

dynode unit (13) to pass therethrough. Each electron through 
hole has a diameter on the inverting dynode plate side 

larger than that on the dynode unit side, thereby 
increasing the capture area of the secondary electrons 

orbit-inverted by the inverting dynode plate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electron 
multiplier and to a photomultiplier. Conventionally, photomultipliers have been widely 
used for various measurements in nuclear medicine and 
high-energy physics as a γ-camera, PET (Positron 
Emission Tomography), or calorimeter. A conventional electron multiplier constitutes a 
photomultiplier having a photocathode. This electron 
multiplier is constituted by an anode and a dynode 
unit constituted by stacking a plurality of stages of 
dynodes in the incident direction of an electron flow 
in a vacuum container. A photomultiplier comprises an anode, a dynode 
unit obtained by stacking N stages of dynodes, and 
inverting dynodes. These members are disposed on a 
base member of a vacuum container. In the general 
manufacture of a photomultiplier, when the interior of 
the vacuum  
 
container is to be set in a vacuum state and an alkali 
metal vapor is to be introduced from the base member 
to deposit and activate the photoelectric surface of 
a photocathode and the secondary electron emitting 
layer of each dynode, the alkali metal vapor flows 
from the peripheral portions of the photocathode and 
each dynode to the central portions thereof to deposit 
the photoelectric surface and the secondary electron 
emitting layer. For this reason, if a means for 
passing the metal vapor is not arranged near the 
inverting dynode, the thicknesses of the alkali metal 
layers at the central portions of the photocathode and 
each dynode are smaller than those at the peripheral 
portions. This causes large sensitivity variations 
depending on the positions of the photoelectric 
surface on which light is incident. Assume that the electron capture area of the 
anode exposed with respect to the dynodes is small at 
the position where the secondary electrons emitted 
from the last-stage dynodes of the dynode unit reach. 
In this case, the field intensity at the anode is 
reduced, and the space charge is highly generated at 
this position. Therefore, the secondary electrons 
captured by the anode are reduced, and therefore a 
large pulse output proportional to the energy of 
incident light cannot be obtained.  
 The present invention aims to provide a 
photomultiplier capable of obtaining a uniform 
sensitivity with respect to the positions of a 
photoelectric surface and an output pulse proportional 
to the energy of incident light. According to the present invention there is 
provided an electron multiplier comprising: a dynode 
unit comprising a plurality of dynode plates
