<ABSTRACT>
A specimen-receiving receptacle apparatus (10) for use in minimally invasive surgical procedures can be remotely opened and closed from a proximal end of the apparatus, outside of the patient (30). The apparatus (10) includes a belt (16) having substantial longitudinal rigidity so that the belt (16) can be forced longitudinally into the surgical site to open the specimen-retrieval receptacle (12) from a remote end of apparatus (10). The belt (16) can be longitudinally pulled out of the surgical site to close the specimen-retrieval receptacle (12) from outside of the patient (30). The belt (16) is relatively flexible or easily deformable along an open end (14) of the receptacle (12) without deforming substantially out of the plane of the open receptacle end (14). This is achieved by aligning the belt (16) with the respect to the open end (14) such that a large dimension of the belt (16) is aligned transverse to the plane of the open receptacle end (14). In a preferred embodiment, the belt (16) is extruded from nylon and has an elliptical cross-sectional shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a
reservoir for receiving and containing physiologic
materials from body cavities. The reservoir is
introduced through a surgical access port
percutaneously inserted into a body cavity and directed
to any site in the body cavity. The reservoir can be
opened or closed remotely outside or exterior to the
body cavity, more particularly, the present invention
is directed to a flexible retrieval reservoir that can
be remotely opened and closed from outside the body
cavity by a control mechanism. This control mechanism
can easily open and close the neck of the reservoir and
allow the easy introduction of any specimen and the
easy sequestration of this material so that it can be
easily and safely removed or extracted from the body
cavity. The ability to easily remotely open the
reservoir is essential to the surgeon because his
ability to move instruments and specimens is difficult
and limited. The ability to easily remotely close the
reservoir is just as essential to avoid contamination
from the sequestered specimen. Many of the specimens
are fragile, infected, chemically noxious, or
malignant. Properly encapsulating the specimen in a
closed reservoir is essential in preventing infections,
chemical damage and malignant spread. The advantages of minimally invasive
endoscopic surgical procedures are well documented
throughout the literature. They require substantially
smaller incisions that are less traumatic to the
patient resulting in accelerated patient recovery and
convalescence. Many body cavities can be entered
through small incisions by utilizing fiber optic visual
systems and special surgical instruments. Thoroscopy,
arthroscopy, cystoscopy and laparoscopy are some of the
most common of these surgical procedures. One of the
most common endoscopic surgical procedures is
laparoscopic surgery. The abdominal wall is pierced
with a trocar assembly including a sharp trocar within
a hollow tube or access port. Multiple other ports are
utilized, depending on the operative requirements, to
introduce various other devices, including a light
source and optical instruments to visualize the
operative field and for the purpose of completing the
surgical procedure.Many times during the course of such an
endoscopic surgical procedure, specimens must be
removed from the patient's body through the relatively
small incision. For this purpose, the specimen to be
removed must best be captured in a reservoir so that it
can be sequestered. Many of these specimens are
noxious and should be

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus (10) for receiving and containing and removing a
specimen (32) from a patient (30) and for percutaneous insertion through an access

port (40) during a minimally invasive surgical procedure, comprising:

a receptacle (12) having an open end (14) for receiving a specimen (32)
and a closed portion, extending from said open end (14) for retaining the specimen

(32); and
a rigid guide member (18) for guiding said receptacle (12) to said
specimen (32); characterised in that said apparatus (10) further comprises a

receptacle manipulating means slidably secured about said open end (14) of said
receptacle (12) and extending along said guide member (18) for remotely opening

and remotely closing said open end (14) of said receptacle (12) by actuation of
said manipulating means.
Apparatus (10) as defined in claim 1, wherein the receptacle open
end (14) is substantially disposed in a plane and wherein the receptacle

manipulating means comprises an elongate belt (16) having a first resistance to
bending in a direction normal to the plane and a second resistance to bending, less

than the first resistance to bending, in a direction parallel to the plane.
Apparatus (10) as defined in claim 1 or claim 2, further comprising
a tubular sleeve (31) extending in a distal direction outwardly from said guide

member (18) adapted to contain the receptacle (12) for initially directing the
receptacle (12) into the access port (40).
Apparatus (10) as defined in claim 2, wherein the belt (16) is
disposed in the plane and is formed in an elliptical cross-sectional shape capable of

flexing easily for opening and closing the open end (14) of said receptacle (12)
without bending substantially outside of the plane so that the belt (16) can be

pushed along the guide member (18) to open the receptacle (12). 
Apparatus (10) as defined in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the
receptacle (12) is formed from a waterproof nylon sheet material and further

comprising securing means (19) for slidably securing said manipulating means
about said open end (1
4) of said receptacle (12).
Apparatus (10) as defined in claim 1, wherein said manipulating
means comprises an elongate polymeric belt (16) having one end fixedly secured

to an end of the guide member (18) proximal to said open end (14) of said
receptacle (12) and having an actuating end extending proximal to another end of

the guide member (18).
Apparatus (10) as defined in claim 6, wherein the actuating end of
said elongate manipulating means is secured to an actuating tube slidably

telescoped over said other end of the guide member (18).
Apparatus (10) as defined in claim 6 further comprising a collar
(20) secured about a distal end (22) of the guide tube (18), a distal end (63) of said

belt (16) being secured to said guide member (18) between the guide member (18)
and the collar (20).
Apparatus (10) as defined in any of the preceding claims wherein
said manipulating means is configured to transmit forces alternately in both

directions along its longitudinal axis, respectively to open and alternately to close
said open end (14) of said receptacle (12).
