<ABSTRACT>
Novel monoazo dyes are described of the general formula (1) given and defined below, which have fibre-reactive properties and are used as dyes for dyeing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing material, especially fibre material, such as wool and synthetic polyamide (nylon) and, in particular, cellulose fibre materials such as cotton.
