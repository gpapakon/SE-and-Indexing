<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to body 
implantable devices, and more particularly to 
prostheses and grafts intended for long-term or 
permanent fixation in body cavities. A wide variety of patient treatment and 
diagnostic procedures involve the use of devices 
inserted into the body of the patient, with some of 
these devices being permanently implanted. Among 
these devices are prostheses or grafts for 
transluminal implantation, for example as disclosed 
in U. S. Patent No. 4,655,771 (Wallsten). The 
prosthesis described in Wallsten is a flexible 
tubular braided structure formed of helically wound 
thread elements. Gripping members at opposite ends 
of the prosthesis initially secure it to a catheter, 
with the proximal gripping member being movable 
distally to give the prosthesis the shape of a 
balloon. In deployment, the gripping members and 
catheter are removed, leaving the prosthesis to 
assume a substantially cylindrical shape as it 
slightly expands and substantially conforms to a 
blood vessel wall or other tissue. Another 
prosthesis is disclosed in U. S. Patent No. 4,681,110 
(Wiktor). A flexible tubular liner, constructed of 
braided strands of a flexible plastic, is insertable 
into the aorta, whereupon it self-expands against an 
aneurysm to direct blood flow past the aneurysm. The 
braided stents of Wallsten and Wiktor axially 
contract as they radially expand. Another elastic stent is shown in U. S. Patent 
No. 4,830,003 (Wolff et al). The stent includes a  
 
series of generally longitudinal wires welded 
together in pairs, with the wires in each pair then 
bent into a "V" shape. Like the braided stents, this 
stent shortens axially as it radially expands. Prostheses also have been constructed of 
plastically deformable materials. U. S. Patent No. 
4,733,665 (Palmaz) discloses intraluminal vascular 
grafts radially expanded using angioplasty balloons. 
The grafts are wire mesh tubes, and axially shorten 
as they radially expand. U. S. Patent No. 4,800,882 
(Gianturco) features a stent formed of wire, 
including a plurality of serpentine bends to form 
opposed loops. A balloon is inflated to radially 
expand the stent, without substantial axial 
shortening. Yet another approach to prosthesis design is 
shown in U. S. Patent No. 3,868,956 (Alfidi et al). 
Alfidi et al discloses a strainer or screen with a 
plurality of generally longitudinal wires, bound 
together by a cylindrical sleeve. The wires are 
deformable into a longitudinal, straight-line 
configuration for implantation.

<CLAIMS>
A device for fixation in a body cavity, 
comprising:
 
   a stent (16) including generally tubular 

and coaxial first and second open weave stent 
segments (20, 22) slidably engaged along respective 

first and second axially inward portions overlapping 
one another to form a medial region (24) of the stent 

(16), said stent segments (20, 22) further including 
respective non-overlapping first and second axially 

outward regions (30, 32) including respective and 
opposite first and second ends (34, 36) of the stent 

(16);
 
   said stent segments (20, 22), at least 

along said axially inward portions, having a 
predetermined first diameter and a predetermined 

first axial length, said stent segments (20, 22) 
being radially compressible to a second diameter less 

than said first diameter and to a second axial length 
longer than said first axial length, to facilitate an 

axial insertion of said stent (16) into a body cavity 
for delivery to a selected location therealong and 

subsequent fixation of the stent (16) within the 
cavity by effecting an engagement of the stent 

segments (20, 22) with a tissue wall segment defining 
said body cavity; and
 
   wherein said first and second axially 

inward portions are capable of sliding relative to one another to 
reduce the axial length of said medial region (24) as 

said stent segments (20, 22) radially expand into 
said engagement under positive fixation of said first and second ends (34,36), 

thus to maintain a substantially 
constant axial length of said stent (16) during said 

radial expansion.  
 
The device of Claim 1 wherein:
 
   each of said stent segments (20, 22) is an 

open weave construction of helically wound filaments 
(18) of a resilient, body-compatible material. 
The device of Claim 2 further including:
 
   a means for fixing said first and second 

ends (34, 36) to said tissue wall segment. 
The device of Claim 3 wherein:
 
   said stent segments (20, 22) are flexible 

and have said predetermined first diameter and first 
axial length when not subject to external force, and 

are elastically compressible to said second diameter. 
The device of Claim 4 wherein:
 
   said fixing means comprises first and 

second flared outer end portions of said first and 
second axially outward regions (30, 32), 

respectively, whereby said first and second ends (34, 
36) have diameters greater than said first diameter 

when the stent (16) is in the relaxed state. 
The device of Claim 5 wherein:
 
   the diameters of said first and second ends 

(34, 36) are greater than said first diameter by at 
least five percent. 
The device of Claim 6 wherein:
 
   the axial length of each of said flared 

outer end portions is less than one-third of the 
axial length of its associated one of said stent 

segments (20, 22). 
The device of Claim 4 wherein:
 
   said fixing means comprises elastic 

reinforcing strands connected to said filaments along 
first and second outer end portions including said 

first and second ends (34, 36), respectively. 
The device of Claim 3 wherein:
  
 

   said fixing means comprises first and 
second pluralities of fixation hooks mounted to the 

stent (16) at said first and second ends (34, 36), 
respectively. 
The device of Claim 1 further including:
 
   an elongate, flexible and substantially 

inextensible member running axially and connected to 
said first and second stent segments (20, 22) 

proximate said first and second ends (34, 36), for 
maintaining the axial length of the stent (16) 

constant during said radial expansion.
