<ABSTRACT>
A CD-I system comprises a display; a cursor control means coupled to the 
display for updating a position of a cursor; and a user-interface means being coupled to 

the cursor control means for user-manipulation of the cursor via the cursor control 
means, and being operative to specify respective displacements of the cursor in a 

respective selected one of a given number, preferably 8, of different directions. The 
user-interface means is operative to specify each respective one of the displacements 

having a fixed length, preferably one pixel per update in a particular operating mode of 
the user-interface means. Advantages are that processing time is reduced, the user-interface 

means is simple, and that conventional joystick software can be used in CD-I 
applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a CD-I system comprising a display; a cursor 
control means coupled to the display for updating a position of a cursor; and a user-interface 
means being coupled to the cursor control means for user-manipulation of the 
cursor via the cursor control means, and being operative to specify respective 
displacements of the cursor in a respective selected one of a given number of different 
directions. With the advent of CD-I there has been created a considerably user-friendly 
medium, which enables interactive handling of information in an ergonomic 
manner. CD-I systems are particularly, but not exclusively, designed for consumer 
applications in domestic environments. CD-I applications, e.g., software on compact 
disc information carriers, are available in a large variety of titles, ranging from video 
games and reference books to teaching and training applications. User-interface aspects 
are considered among the key issues that govern the wide acceptance of CD-I. For 
further information on technical issues in general, see "Compact Disc-Interactive; A 
Designer's Overview", Kluwer, Nov. 1988, ISBN 9020121219. In many CD-I applications (programs), user-interaction with the data 
processing system is achieved through cursor control. A cursor is a figure, which is 
displayed on the display screen and whose position can be changed relative to the screen 
by the user manipulating the user-interface means, e.g., a manoeuvring device such as a 
joystick. The user moves the cursor around the screen as in a video game, or positions 
the cursor in a particular area shown on the screen, e.g., to select a particular program 
option as in a menu. The user-interface means may be provided with a manoeuvring 
functionality such as, for example, a plurality of buttons, each for control of the cursor 
movement in a particular direction, a joy-stick, or a single thumb-controlled button for 
selective multiple-direction control of the cursor, or with a mouse. The user-interface  
 
means employed nowadays in CD-I is a pointer device, the so-called thumb-stick, 
permitting the cursor to be controlled in any of 32 directions at a large variety of 
speeds. The CD-I standard defines all I/O functions and I/O devices in the CD-I 
system, and defines the communication protocols. The devices commonly available 
within CD-I, a video device with a display screen, a keyboard device and a pointer 
device for cursor control, each are supervised by one overall driver, called the User 
Communications Manager

<CLAIMS>
A CD-I system comprising: 

a display; 
a cursor control means coupled to the display for updating a position of a cursor; and 
a user-interface means being coupled to the cursor control means for user-manipulation 
of the cursor via the cursor control means, and being operative to specify 

respective displacements of the cursor in a respective selected one of a given number of 
different directions; 

characterized in that 
the user-interface means is operative to specify each respective one of the 
displacements having a fixed length in a particular operating mode of the user-interface 

means. 
The system of claim 1, wherein the given number of directions equals 
eight in the particular operating mode. 
The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the fixed length in the particular 
operating mode equals one pixel per update. 
The system of claim 1 or 2, wherein the user-interface is programmable to 
operate according to a further operating mode permitting a variable-length displacement. 
A user-interface means for use in the system of claim 1, 2, 3 or 4.
