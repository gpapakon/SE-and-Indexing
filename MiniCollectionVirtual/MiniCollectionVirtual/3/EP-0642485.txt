<ABSTRACT>
A process for converting an oxygenate feed to high purity olefins such as polymer-grade propylene (C30/C3=  
<
/=  0.05) at a temperature of about 450  DEG C (842  DEG F), using a molecular sieve catalyst having a high preselected Si/Al2 ratio (such as ZSM-5, ZSM-48) or a preselected Si/Fe2 ratio (such as FeZSM-5), or SAPO-34.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for 
converting an oxygenate to high purity olefins by 
contacting the oxygenate with a molecular sieve 
catalyst. More particularly, the invention relates to 
a process for converting a methanol or methanol-water 
mixture to polymer-grade propylene by contacting the 
feed with zeolite or silicoaluminophosphate catalysts. High purity olefins such as propylene have 
traditionally been produced through the process of 
steam and/or catalytic cracking. Because of the 
limited availability and high cost of petroleum 
sources, the cost of producing high purity olefins 
from such petroleum sources has been steadily 
increasing. Curtailment in the availability of 
inexpensive petroleum raw materials threatens the 
supply of high purity olefins such as polymer-grade 
propylene. Polymer-grade propylene is used in the 
production of many types of plastics such as 
polypropylene. The search for alternative materials for high 
purity olefin production has led to the use of 
oxygenates such as alcohols, and more particularly to 
methanol and higher alcohols or their derivatives. 
These alcohols may be produced by fermentation or from 
synthesis gas. Synthesis gas can be produced from 
natural gas, petroleum liquids, carbonaceous materials 
including coal, recycled plastics, municipal wastes, 
or any organic material. Thus, alcohol and alcohol 
derivatives may provide non-petroleum based feeds for 
high purity olefin production.  
 Molecular sieves, such as crystalline zeolite 
catalysts, are known to promote the conversion of 
oxygenates to olefin-containing hydrocarbon mixtures. 
US-A-4,025,575 and US-A-4,083,889 disclose processes 
for conversion of methanol and/or methyl ether to 
olefin-containing products using ZSM-5-type zeolite 
catalysts. Chang et al., US-A-4,724,270, describe a process 
for converting methanol feedstocks to aromatic 
hydrocarbons using zeolite catalysts (having a silica-to-alumina 
ratio of at least 12) at a temperature of 
at least 725°C (1337°F). By conducting the reaction 
at elevated temperatures, zeolite dehydroxylation can 
occur. This can lead to zeolite decomposition to 
amorphous silica and alumina. US-A-4,433,189 to Young teaches conversion of 
methanol to light olefins over zeolite catalysts 
having a silica-to-alumina molar ratio of at least 12, 
and at a temperature of from about 200°C (392°F) to 
500°C (932°F). The Young patent does not teach 
conversion of methanol to products such as polymer-grade 
propylene. US-A-4,677,243 to Kaiser
