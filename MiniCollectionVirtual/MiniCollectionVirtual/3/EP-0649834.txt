<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel carboxybetaine and 
sulfobetaine, their production processes, and a detergent 
composition and cosmetic using the carboxybetaine or the 
sulfobetaine. More particularly, it relates to a novel 
carboxybetaine and sulfobetaine which is useful as a base 
material and moisture keeping agent of hair cosmetics, skin 
cosmetics and the like, to production processes thereof, and 
a detergent composition and cosmetic using the carboxybetaine 
or sulfobetaine. In general, in order to provide hair and the skin 
with a moist feeling, shampoos, rinses, cosmetics and the 
like are frequently blended with various types of moisture 
keeping agents such as for example glycerol, propylene 
glycol, sorbitol, urea and alkylene oxide addition products 
of saccharides. However, these prior art moisture keeping agents are 
not always satisfactory in terms of their moisture keeping 
ability, sense of touch and the like, and their effects 
cannot be sustained because they are apt to diffuse and 
removed by sweat, water and the like. In addition, in the 
case of wash-off type cosmetics such as a rinse, a body rinse 
and the like, as well as a detergent which contains a surface  
 
active agent in a large quantity, the moisture keeping agent 
contained therein frequently fails to exert its intrinsic 
effects because the greater part of the agent is washed away 
when used. In view of the above, great concern has been directed 
toward the development of a compound which has excellent 
moisture keeping ability, sense of touch and the like and can 
maintain its moisture keeping effect for a prolonged period 
of time even after its exposure to sweat and water or 
rinsing. Taking the aforementioned circumstances into 
consideration, the present inventors have conducted intensive 
studies and, as a result, found that carboxybetaines and 
sulfobetaines specified by the following formulae have an 
excellent moisture keeping ability, can be produced at a low 
cost and are useful as a base material and moisture keeping 
agent for various detergent compositions, hair and skin 
cosmetics and the like. The present invention has been 
accomplished on the basis of this finding. Namely, according to the present invention, there is 
provided a carboxybetaine represented by the following 
formula (1):  wherein Z¹ represents a residue remaining after removal of 
m¹ + n¹ hydroxyl groups from glycerol or a glycerol 
condensate; R¹ and R² are the same or different and each 
represents hydrogen atom or methyl group; A¹
