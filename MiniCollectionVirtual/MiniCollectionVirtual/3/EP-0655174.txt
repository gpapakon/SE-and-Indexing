<DESCRIPTION>
 "TRANSISTOR CIRCUIT FOR POWERING A FLUORESCENT LAMP".Background of the InventionFluorescent lamps operate most efficiently if driven by AC (alternating current) power at a frequency of around 30 KHz (kilohertz). To operate efficiently from standard power distribution systems, an electronic ballast converts AC line power at 50 Hz (hertz) to 60 Hz to higher frequency AC power. The ballast must have a low power factor (PF) and produce little total harmonic distortion (THD) at the input AC line. To accomplish these tasks, an electronic ballasts has a rectifier to convert AC power to DC power, a boost converter for increasing the voltage of the DC power above peak of the line as well as providing power factor correction, and an inverter for converting voltage boosted DC power into AC power at around 30 KHz.The boost converter consists of a boost inductor and a transistor operated as a switch. The output of the boost converter is connected to a half-bridge two transistors inverter. The output of the half-bridge inverter, through a transformer, drives the fluorescent lamps.The usual topology of such a boost converter coupled to an inverter requires three power transistors. The result is a circuit with a large number of parts, and thus increased complexity and increased assembly costs.Brief Description of the DrawingsFig. 1 is a circuit for powering gas discharge lamps. 

 Fig. 2 shows the current envelope for current through boost inductor 108 and collector current for transistor 128.Fig. 3 shows the collector current for transistors 118 an<J 128 when the line voltage is approximately zero. Fig. 4 shows the current through various circuit components when the line voltage is near the maximum.Description of a Preferred EmbodimentReferring to Fig. 1, terminals 100, 102 receive AC power at a first, relatively low frequency about 60 Hz. Rectifier 104 converts the AC power into single polarity pulsed DC power. Rectifier 104 may be a full wave bridge rectifier.Capacitor 106 connects the output terminals of rectifier 104. (Capacitor 106 could also be across terminals 100, 102.)Capacitor 106 is a low impedance current source for boost inductor 108. Boost inductor 108 stores energy and periodically releases the energy into the remainder of the circuit. Blocking diode 110, coupled between boost inductor 108 and node 112 prevents current from flowing in reverse through inductor 108 from the remainder of the circuit.Switching circuit 114 consists of transistor 118 (shown here as a bipolar junction transistor (BJT), but it
