<DESCRIPTION>
 PHENOL DERIVATIVES AS AGONISTS OF A CYCLIC AMP DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASEThe present invention relates to phenol derivatives, processes for their preparation, intermediates in their preparation, their use as medicaments and to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.The compounds of this invention are agonists of a cyclic AMP- dependent protein kinase (cA-PrK) (see J. Biol. Chem., 1989, 264, 8443 - 8446) and are of use in combatting such conditions where such agonism is thought to be beneficial. They are likely to have anti-proliferative, anti-aggregatory, cholesterol-lowering, smooth muscle relaxant, positive lusitropic, anti-allergic or anti-inflammatory activities. They are likely to be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases where there is a component of diastolic failure, cancer, psoriasis, atheroschlerosis, thrombosis, re-stenosis, chronic reversible lung disease such as asthma and bronchitis, allergic disease such as allergic asthma,, allergic rhinitis and urticaria or gut motility disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome.Accordingly the present, invention provides compounds of the formula (1) :or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein :R0 is OH or a bioprecursor thereof,R1 is A°C02H, P(Z) (OH) (OR2), S02H, SO3H or 5-tetrazolyl or a bioprecursor thereof, 

 A0 is CH2, CHF, CF2, CR3 (OR4) , CO or C (OR5) (OR6) ,R2 is phenyl, C3_5C cloal yl, C3_5cycloal lCι_4alkyl, or C]_-8al yl optionally substituted by Cι_4al oxy,R3 is H, methyl or ethyl,R4 is H or C _3alkyl,R5 and R6 are each Cι_3al yl or together form a 1,2- ethanediyl group or 1,3-propanediyl group,Z is 0 or S, andAr is phenyl optionally substituted by one to three groups independently selected from Ci-galkyl, C2-6 lkenyl, C^-galkoxy, C3_galkenyloxy, C3_gcycloalkyl, C3_gcycloalkoxy, Ci-galkylthio, phenyl, phenylthio, benzyloxy, Ci-gpolyfluoroalkyl, Ci-gpolyfluoroalkoxy, halo, N(R7)£ or NHCOR7 wherein R7 is H or Ci-galkyl, or -X(CH2>nY~ attached to adjacent carbon atoms of the phenyl ring wherein X and Y are independently CH2 or 0 and n is 1 to 3, wherein said C^-galkyl, C2-6allcenyl or C^-galkoxy groups can be independently substituted by OH, Ci-galkoxy, C3_ςcycloalkyl, N(R7)2r C02R7 or C0N(R7)2.Bioprecursors of the groups R^ and R^ are derivatives thereof which are convertible in vivo into the groups R^ and R1.A suitable bioprecursor of the group R^ is OR wherein R^ is Cι_4al anoyl (for example acetyl) , arylCι_4alkanoyl (for example phenyl Cι_4al anoyl such as benzoyl) , arylsulphonyl (for example optionally
