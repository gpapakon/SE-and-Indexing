<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to reducing, or preventing, bone 
marrow hypoplasia in a patient at risk of, or having, same. To this end, 

when a glutathione intracellular stimulator is administered to such a 
patient, the risk of bone marrow hypoplasia is reduced or prevented. In 

an embodiment, the composition for stimulating the intracellular 
glutathione levels comprises L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to reducing or preventing bone 
marrow hypoplasia. Presently, 3'-Azidothymidine (AZT) is the primary therapy for the 
treatment of AIDS. AZT is an antiretroviral drug that is active against 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In this regard, AZT is an inhibitor 
of the in vitro replication of some retroviruses, including HIV. AZT is 
marketed by the Burroughs Wellcome Company under the name Retrovir. 
Retrovir is the brand name for Zidovudine (formerly called azidothymidine 
(AZT)). See Physician Desk Reference, 44th Edition, 1990, pg. 799. Recently, attention has been focused on another potential treatment 
for AIDS using DDI. DDI is also an antiretroviral drug. Unfortunately, AZT has a significant dose dependent toxicity. In 
fact, the 1990 PDR bears the following statement:     Therapy with Retrovoir (Zidovudine) is often 
associated with hematologic toxicity including 
granulocytopenia and severe anemia requiring 
transfusions (see warnings). AZT related bone marrow toxicity limits the utility 
of the drug. See, Thompson et al, "Hematologic Toxicity 
of AZT and ddC Administered as Single Agent and in 
Combination to Rats and Mice", Fundamental and Applied 
Toxicity, 17, 159-176 (1991). Although the basis of the 
toxicity is not completely understood, some evidence 
suggests a metabolite of AZT, 3'-amino-3'-deoxythymidine 
(AMT), may be at least partially responsible. See, 
Cretton, "Catabolism of 3'-Azido-3'-deoxythymidine in 
Hepatocytes in Liver Microsomes, with Evidence of 
Formation of 3'-Amino-3'-deoxythymidine, a Highly Toxic 
Catabolite for Human Bone Marrow Cells", Molecular 
Pharmacology, 39:258-266. It has been reported that some 
thiols, including reduced glutathione, can reduce AZT to 
AMT in vivo. See, Handlon et al, "Thiol Reduction of 3'-Azidothymidine 
to 3'-Aminothymidine: Kinetics and 
Biomedical Implications", Pharmaceutical Research, Vol. 
5, No. 5, 1988. Additionally, long term administration of AZT can 
cause mitochondrial mycotoxicity. See, Lamperth et al, 
"Abnormal Skeletal and Cardiac Muscle Mitochondria 
Induced by Zidovudine (AZT) in Human Muscles In Vitro and 
in Animal Model", Laboratory Investigation, 1991, 65:742. 
This results in a myopathy that develops after a mean 
period of 12 months of therapy. Id.Further adverse reactions have been reported with 
AZT. Additionally, DDI has been reported to also cause 
a variety of severe adverse reactions.  Due to the dose dependent toxicity of AZT and DDI 
the effectiveness of these drugs as
