<ABSTRACT>
A known three-phrase rectifier (A) has at least one sub-unit having a first three-phase system and a second three-phase system in parallel line branches (1a, 1b, 1c and 3a, 3b, 3c), which each contain a six-pulse bridge circuit (B) with controllable converter valves. A device produces a phase shift in the voltages of the first three-phase system by 30@ with respect to those of the second three-phase system. Only a single regulator is required to regulate the output voltage of the three-phase rectifier (A). The regulator periodically emits a delay angle which is intended for driving the converter valves of a specific six-pulse bridge circuit (B). The delay angles for the other six-pulse bridge circuits (B) are calculated from the delay angle of the regulator, taking into account the currents flowing out of the six-pulse bridge circuits (i1, i2).

Controlled polyphase alternating current rectifier with at least 
one partial unit with a first and a second polyphase alternating 

current system in parallel conduction branches (1, 2), which each 
comprise a respective six-pulse bridge circuit (B) with controllable 

rectifier valves, and with a device which produces a phase shift of 
the voltages of the first polyphase alternating current system by 30° 

relative to those of the second polyphase alternating current system, 
wherein this device lies in the conduction branch (2) of the second 

polyphase alternating current system and is connected in front of the 
six-pulse bridge circuit (B), which is disposed therein, with respect 

to the direction of energy flow and wherein the positive and negative 
output terminals of all six-pulse bridge circuits (B) are connected 

together directly and form the connecting terminals of the rectified 
output voltage (7), characterised thereby, that in the case of several 

partial units, all partial units are constructed identically and 
connected in parallel, that a respective mains choke (4) is connected 

in front of each of the six-pulse bridge circuits (B) in all 
conductors (1a, 1b, 1c and 3a, 3b, 3c) of the conduction branches (1, 

2), that the output voltage (7) is automatically regulated by a single 
regulator (10), that control angles (α₁) are produced for this purpose 

by this regulator (10) merely for a single fixed six-pulse bridge 
circuit (B) and that the control angles (α₂) for each further six-pulse 

bridge circuit (B) are formed from these control angles (α₁) with the 
inclusion of the current (i₂) flowing out of the respective six-pulse 

bridge circuit (B). 
Controlled polyphase alternating current rectifier according to 
claim 1, characterised thereby, that the regulator (10) produces a 

control angle (α₁) at fixed intervals of time.  
 
Controlled polyphase alternating current rectifier according to 
claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby, that for the resetting of the 

output voltage (7) after each instant (t₁ to t₆) of a natural commutation, 
a reduced control angle is determined for the time-delayed driving of 

the rectifier valves (5) for each six-pole bridge circuit (B), that - 
in the case of a polyphase alternating current rectifier (A) with only 

a single partial unit - a control angle (α₂) for the other six-pulse 
bridge circuit (B) is formed by the control angle (α₁) produced by the 

regulator (10) with the addition of the integral of the difference of 
the current (i₂) out of the positive output (5a) of the respective six-pulse 

bridge circuit (B) and the current (i₁) out of the positive 
output (5a) of the fixed six-pulse bridge circuit (B), that in the 

case of several partial units, the control angles for the six-pulse 
bridge circuits (B) other than the fixed six-pulse bridge circuit (B) 

are formed thereby, that - for each individual one of these six-pulse 
bridge circuits (B) - the integral of the deviation of the current 

from the positive output (5a) of the six-pulse bridge circuit (B) 
concerned from the mean value of the currents from the positive 

outputs of all six-pulse bridge circuits (B) is added to the control 
angle (α₁) produced by the regulator (10), that - between the instants 

(t₁ to t₆) of the natural commutation - reduced control angles are 
computed from the control angles (α₁,α₂) in that the reduced control 

angle assumes only values of 0° to 60° by a single subtraction of 0°, 
60° or 120° from each individual control angle (α₁,α₂), that the 

magnitude of the reduced control angle is proportional to the duration 
from the next instant (t₁ to t₆) of the natural commutation to the 

ignition of those rectifier valves which are determined by an ignition 
pattern formed by an ignition pattern generating unit, that the 

control angles (α₁,α₂) from 0° to 60° are graded into a first range, 
that the control angles (α

α₂) from more than 60° to 120° are graded 
into a second range and that the control angles (α₁, α₂) of more than 

120° are graded into a third range, that the voltage period is 
subdivided into six cycles by the course of a conductor voltage of a 

certain polyphase alternating current system, that an ignition pattern 
is stored with rising index for each cycle in a table, that the  

 
sequence of the ignition patterns to be issued from this table 

individually to the six-pulse bridge circuits (B) depends on the 
ranges, to which two successive control angles are allocated, wherein 

- in the case of like ranges - the ignition pattern with the next 
higher index is delivered at the next instant (t₃ to t₆) of the 

natural commutation and the sequence departs from the sequence in the 
table only when two successive control angles (α₁,α₂) are allocated 

to two different ranges, wherein - in the case of a step from a higher 
range to a lower range - after the next instant (t₃ to t₆) of the 

natural commutation, an intermediate pulse pattern is delivered 
initially, which is stored in the table in front of the actual 

ignition pattern and the actual ignition pattern is subsequently 
conducted to the six-pulse bridge circuit (B) concerned with a delay 

dependent on the reduced control angle.
