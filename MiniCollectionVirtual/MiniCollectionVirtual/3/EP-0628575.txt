<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of highly reactive polyisobutenes having a content of terminal vinylidene groups of greater than 80 mol % and having a mean molecular weight of 500 - 5000 daltons by cationic polymerisation of isobutene or isobutene-containing hydrocarbon steams in the liquid phase with the aid of boron trifluoride as catalyst and at temperatures of from 0@C to -60@C in the presence of boron trifluoride and secondary alcohols having 3 - 20 carbon atoms.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing highly reactive polyisobutenes
with a content of terminal vinylidene groups of

more than 80 mol% and an average molecular weight of
500 - 5000 Dalton by the cationic polymerization of

isobutene or isobutene-containing hydrocarbon streams in
liquid phase with the aid of boron trifluoride as

catalyst and at from 0°C to -60°C, which comprises
polymerizing in the presence of straight-chain or

branched, monohydric secondary alcohols with 3 - 20
carbon atoms and in this instance a boron

trifluoride/secondary alcohol molar ratio of 0.5 to 0.9
is employed.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
boron trifluoride and the secondary alcohol are mixed in

the polymerization apparatus, and boron trifluoride/
secondary alcohol complexes are generated in situ in the

polymerization mixture.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
boron trifluoride and the secondary alcohol are mixed

before they are introduced into the polymerization
apparatus, and the boron trifluoride/secondary alcohol

complexes formed thereby are passed into the polymerization
mixture.
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
secondary alcohol used is isopropanol or 2-butanol.
