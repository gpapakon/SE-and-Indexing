<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to in-ground barriers, of the kind that comprise 
pile-driven elements of sheet material, and the like. Such barriers are often 
required to be watertight, or at least to be leak resistant. Patent publication GB-2228760 (VALES, published 05 Sept 1990) shows an 
arrangement of the interlocking edge forms of the elements of a barrier, the 
illustrated arrangement being highly effective to resist leakage. The present 
invention may be regarded as an improvement to that type of interlocking 
edge-form arrangement. In VALES, one of the key aspects is that a cavity is created in the potential 
leak path that exists between two interlocking elements. The cavity is defined 
by the profiles of the interlocking edge forms. The cavity is large enough that 
a hose pipe may be passed down the cavity, and water then may be flushed 
through the cavity. When the cavity is flushed out, an injecting or dispensing 
pipe may be inserted into the cavity, and a sealant and/or adhesive may be 
injected into the cavity. The present invention is aimed at improving the reliability with which the 
sealed junctions of this general type can be regarded as leak proof. The invention consists in a leak-resistant barrier. Each element of the barrier 
has a senior edge form which interlocks with, and is pile-driven or otherwise 
inserted ahead of, a junior edge form of the next adjacent element.  
 In the invention, the configurations of the interlocking pairs of senior and junior 
edge forms are such that the configurations thereof jointly form the 
circumferences of two enclosed cavities. In respect of each one of the two enclosed cavities, a portion of the 
circumference of the enclosed cavity is constituted by a portion of the senior 
edge form, and another portion of the circumference of that same enclosed 
cavity is constituted by a portion of the interlocking junior edge form. In respect of both cavities, the portion of the circumference of the cavity 
constituted by the junior edge form preferably is the major portion of that 
circumference. The barrier includes means for keeping the said enclosed cavities clear 
of dirt and debris when the barrier is installed. Preferably, this takes the form 
of scrapers attached to the foot of the junior edge form, which act to deflect 
the dirt and debris laterally away from the cavities as the junior edge form is 
driven onto the senior. In respect of each one of the two enclosed cavities, the edge forms are so 
shaped that each enclosed cavity includes a respective

the cavities can be sealed, and the potential leakpaths communicating with that 

cavity can be sealed, from top to bottom, independently of whether the other 
cavity is sealed.

comprised by contacting interfaces between the edge-forms;

tight and tortuous; 
the potential leakpaths are tight and tortuous enough to substantially contain a sealant 
within the cavity. 
Barrier of claim 2, wherein the arrangement of the interlocking edge forms 
is such as to define three of the said tight and tortuous pathways, the first 

being a pathway from one of the cavities to the front of the barrier, the second 
being a pathway from the other of the cavities to the rear of the barrier, and 

the third being a pathway between the two cavities. 
Barrier of claim 1, wherein the inscribed circle is clear and open over a 
diameter of at least 18 mm.
