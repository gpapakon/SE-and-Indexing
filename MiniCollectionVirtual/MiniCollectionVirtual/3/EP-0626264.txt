<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a container
for a recording head as an ink ejecting means, which
is used with an ink jet recording apparatus for
effecting recording by ejecting ink.In the field of an ink jet recording, an ink
jet cartridge has been proposed which integrally has a
recording head portion and an ink container portion,
and which is detachably mountable as a unit on a
carriage movable for recording, from the standpoint of
the downsizing of the apparatus and easy maintenance
and so on.Figure 1 shows an example of such an ink jet
cartridge IJC. In the Figure 1 100 designates a
recording head; 200, ink container. They are integral
with each other. An ink container 200 is provided
with an air vent 23 for opening the inside of the ink
container 200 to the ambiente. The recording head is
provided with an ejection outlet or outlets 9 for
ejecting ink.An ink jet cartridge IJC of this structure is
preferably hermetically sealed at the opening portions
to prevent leakage of the ink therein, when the ink
jet cartridge IJC is transported. In this example,
ejection side surface 26 provided with the ejection 
outlets 9 and the air vent 23 are sealed by a seal 22,
and in addition, the ejection side surface 26 is
pressed by a pressing member 21 having an elastic
portion 21a. The thus sealed ink jet cartridge IJC is
contained in a container 25, and the opening thereof
is covered with a covering member 24. Then, they are
sealed by heat-sealing or the like.When the ink in the ink container 200 is used
up, the recording head 100 is also exchanged.
However, at this time, the recording head 100 may have
sufficient service life, and therefore, it is wasteful
to exchange the recording head 100 also at this stage.Under the circumstances, a proposal has been
made in which the recording head 100 and the ink
container 200 are made separable from each other. In
use, they are integral on a carriage. After the ink
container 200 becomes empty, only the ink container
200 is exchanged.With such a structure, the recording head is
packaged alone. The recording head 100 is filled with
ink or clear ink for the purpose of prevention of
oxidation of its heaters. Therefore, as shown in
Figure 2, the ejection side surface 26 is sealed by a
seal 22, and an opening of ink supply port 2200 for
receiving ink supplied thereto, is covered with a cap
30. Then it is placed in a container, which, in
turn, is capped. Thus, it is packaged. Thus, in packaging the recording head 100 per se,
the ejection side surface and an ink supply port 2200

<CLAIMS>
A container for containing at least an ink jet
head cartridge, characterized in that it comprises:


a main body (25), having an opening, for containing
an article including at least the ink jet head cartridge

(IJHC);
a covering member (24) for covering the opening; and
an ink retaining portion (52) provided in said main body so
as to become adjacent an ink receiving opening (2200) of the ink jet

head cartridge, for retaining, using capillary force, ink
or another liquid leaked out of the article.
A container according to claim 1, wherein said
ink retaining portion (52) is at the bottom of said main

body (25) and a supporting portion (50) is provided
around said ink retaining portion for supporting said

ink jet head cartridge (IJHC) to prevent contact
between said ink jet head cartridge and said ink

retaining portion (52).
A container according to claim 1, wherein said
ink retaining portion (52) has a plurality of fine grooves.
A container according to claim 1 or 2 wherein
said ink retaining portion (52) has a plurality of fine bosses.
A container according to claim 1 or 2 wherein
said ink retaining portion (52) includes a liquid absorbing

material.
A container according to claim 5, wherein said
absorbing material is provided with an opening (52a) for

receiving a member constituting said ink receiving
opening (2000).
A container according to any one of the preceding
claims, wherein said ink jet head catridge is provided

with an ink ejection outlet (26), which is sealed by a
sealing member (22).
