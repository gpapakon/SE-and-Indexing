<ABSTRACT>
2.1 A known valve formed by an end face of a valve element and the mouth region of an opening in a mating piece, has an extension which projects into the opening to ensure a gently sloping characteristic for its initial opening. The opening behaviour achieved in this way is not adequate in all cases of use. 2.2 To make the characteristic for the initial opening slope even more gentle, the invention proposes to make the fit between the extension (12) and the opening (5) a clearance fit which is interrupted by a recess (19) in the extension or the opening (5). The recess (19) is designed and arranged in such a way (e.g. in the form of a groove) that, together with the mating part of the clearance fit, it forms at least one oblique control edge and hence a variable restrictor arranged in series with the valve. 2.3 One special area of application for the invention is in valve arrangements for compressed-air systems in motor vehicles.

Valve (11, 31) formed by an end face (6) of a valve
body (31) and the mouth region (11) of an opening (5) in

a counter-part (1),

wherein

from the end face (6) which in the closed state of the
valve (11, 31) lies on the mouth region (11), forming a

seal, there extends an extension piece (30) engaging the
opening (5),
the opening (5) has a circumferential edge (15),
on the circumferential face of the extension piece (30) a
guide region (10) is formed, which passes the edge (15)

with a loose fit,
the extension piece (30) has at least one countersinking
(33, 34) having an extent leading away from the

end face (6) and having a cross-section that widens with
increasing distance from the end face (6),
the countersinking (33, 34) is arranged so that, with the
valve (11, 31) closed, viewed from the end face (6), it

is located with at least a part on the other side of the
edge (15) and with that part at least partially passes

over the edge (15) as the valve (11, 31) opens,

characterised in that

the countersinking is constructed on the end of the
extension piece (30) remote from the end face (6) in the

form of at least two opposing intersecting terminating 
faces (33, 34) inclined towards the end face (6), the

intersection region forming the region of the terminating
faces (33, 34) furthest from the end face (6).
