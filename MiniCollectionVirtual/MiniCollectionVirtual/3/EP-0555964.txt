<ABSTRACT>
In a terminal assembly (10) for termination of flat 
conductors (16,22) having an initially integral cable-proximate 

member (40) with a hinge section (46). A pair 
of insert members (48,50) are to be secured to cable-remote 

surface (52) of first terminal portion (42), and 
a pair of insert members (56,58) are likewise secured to 

cable-remote surface (60) of second terminal portion 
(44). First and second portions (42,44) of cable-proximate 

member (40) include first and second halves 
(64,66,68,70) joined by pairs of upturned side edges 

(72,74,76,78) at pairs of opposed ligatures 
(80,82,86). The ligatures (80,82,86) surround 

openings (88,90), and a pair of hinge sections (46) form 
an opening (92). The ligatures (80,82,86) can be 

severed to form electrically discrete circuits.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
electrical connectors and more particularly to terminals
for use with flat power cables.A known terminal is described in US-A-4,867,700,
wherein terminals are crimped onto a flat power cable by
penetrating the insulation covering the cable's flat
conductor and also shearing through the conductor at a
plurality of locations.One embodiment of terminal is stamped and formed of
sheet metal and includes a pair of opposing plate
sections disposed along respective major surfaces of the
cable and including opposing termination "wave-shape"
regions extending transversely across the cable. When
the plate sections are pressed against a cable section
disposed therebetween the crests of the wave shapes
initiate cable shearing by their axially oriented side
edges cutting through the cable insulation and into and
through the metal conductor. Further, with regard to
the terminal of the above patent, fastened to the
outwardly facing surface of the plate sections at the
terminating regions are respective inserts of low
resistance copper. The inserts have terminal-facing
surfaces conforming closely to the shaped outer surface
of the terminating region, with alternating wave shapes
and apertures disposed outwardly of and along the
terminal wave shapes and relief recesses. Upon
termination, the wave joints are within the insert
apertures, and the sheared edges of the adjacent
conductor strips and of the terminal wave shapes which
formed the sheared strips are adjacent to side surfaces
of the copper insert apertures.The above described termination has the following
advantages. A contact section is integrally included on
the terminal enabling mating with corresponding contact
means of an electrical connector, or a bus bar, or a
power supply terminal, for example, and can include a
plurality of contact sections to distribute the power to 
a corresponding plurality of contact means if desired.However, on the other hand, the termination of the above
construction has the following disadvantages. The known
device is limited to interconnection as an adapter between a
single-conductor flat cable and a bus bar or electrical
contact means and cannot be used to interconnect two flat
cables with either a single or double conductor cable.
Further, the known device does not provide for an
interconnection between the mid-section of a continuous length
of cable and an electrical contact means for electrical
continuity with other electrical components. Still further,
the known device does not

<CLAIMS>
A terminal assembly (10) for a flat power cable (16)
having at least one insulated conductor (12), comprising a

cable terminal body having upper and lower terminal sections
(42,44) including arrays of wave shaped shearing means (94,96)

for shearing the conductor(s), an opening (88,90) separating
each of said upper and lower terminal sections into first and

second halves (64,66,68,70) which are at least initially
electrically joined by severable ligatures (80,82,84,86)

extending beside the opening, and electrically conductive
first and second insert members (48,50,56,58) secured on each

of said first and second halves of said upper and lower
terminal sections for electrical contact with the sheared

conductor(s), characterised in that the upper and lower
terminal sections (42,44) are pivotally interconnected by

hinge sections (46) enabling movement of the terminal sections
towards the cable, and in that the ligatures (80,82,84,86) are

contiguous with opposing upturned side edges (72,74,76,78)
along the halves (64,66,6
8,70) of each of the terminal
sections, the upturned side edges and the ligatures being

arranged to extend edgewise of the cable for ease in severing
the ligatures.
A terminal assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
openings (88,90) extend partially through the severable

ligatures (80,82,84,86), whereby the ligatures (80,82,84,86)
are narrower than the upturned side edges (72,74,76,78).
A terminal assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein
a single contact section (202) extends from a free edge (225)

of one of the upper and lower terminal sections (206,208) for
forming a common electrical circuit for engagement to other

electrical components. 
A terminal assembly as claimed in claims 1 or 2, wherein
first and second electrical contact sections (334,336) extend

from a free edge (326) of said upper and lower terminal
sections (310,314), whereby upon severing of the ligatures

(82,84,86,88), said first and second electrical contact
sections (334,336) comprise electrically discrete circuits.
A terminal assembly as claimed in any preceding claim,
including a cover (30,32) enclosing the cable terminal body.
