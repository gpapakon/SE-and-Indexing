<ABSTRACT>
Sweet ice stuffs and jellied foods produced in 
accordance with the present invention using trehalose as one of 

raw materials are of low calorie and high-grade feeling, and 
sweet ice stuffs and jellied foods produced by substituting all 

or part of the cariogenic sugar or a substitute therefor as one 
of raw materials in the recipe for prior art products with 

trehalose and water or the like are of low cariogenicity, low 
calorie and high-grade feeling.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to sweet ice stuffs and jellied 
foods whose physical properties such as solubility and 
smoothness in the mouth and the like are improved with the use 
of trehalose. It also relates to sweet ice stuffs and jellied 
foods which are produced by substituting the cariogenic sugars, 
including sucrose and the like, in the recipe of prior art 
products with trehalose and water or the like. Sugars such as sucrose and the like are used in ice 
creams and other sweet ice stuffs having an overrun and quality 
jellies, and their amounts are increased together with other 
components in order to produce further upgraded products having 
an excellent taste, physical properties, shape-holding function 
and the like. However, because of the current inclination toward low 
calorie food, it is desirable to reduce amounts of calorie-rich 
components among the solid contents of ice creams and jellies as 
low as possible, while simultaneously providing a high grade 
feeling. In order to produce such low calorie products, it is 
necessary to use an additive material which shows significant 
physical property-improving effect even in a small amount, and 
such an additive material therefore becomes subject matter to be 
developed.  Also, because of the current inclination toward low 
cariogenic and low calorie food, it is desirable to avoid the 
use of sucrose and the like cariogenic sugars as far as possible 
by substituting other fillers for them and to reduce amounts of 
calorie-rich components such as sucrose as low as possible, 
while simultaneously providing excellent physical properties. In 
order to produce such low cariogenic and low calorie products, 
it is necessary to develop a filler which can hold water well 
and provide excellent physical properties. In an aspect of the present invention, there are 
provided sweet ice stuffs and jellied foods which are produced 
using trehalose as one of the raw materials. In another aspect of the present invention, there are 
provided sweet ice stuffs and jellied foods which are produced 
by substituting trehalose and water for all or part of the 
cariogenic and calorie-rich sugar content as one of the raw 
materials in the recipe of prior art products. Other objects and advantages of the present invention 
will be made apparent from the description. With the aim of overcoming the aforementioned problems 
involved in the prior art, the inventors of the present 
invention have conducted intensive studies and found that the 
addition of a small amount of
