<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns liquid crystal
polymer (LCP) materials and method for preparing same.LCP's are known and are used in the electro-optical
device industry, for example, in optical storage
devices, in non-linear optical devices and in
pyroelectric devices, see for example, GB 2146787 A and
Makromol Chem, 186 2639-2647, 1985.One known type of LCP consists of a polymeric
backbone to which are attached - pendant side
chains which have a chemical structure that is
mesogenic, ie. that induces liquid crystalline
character, these being known as side chain liquid
crystal polymers. Work in this field has identified a
large number of side chain structures which are
suitable, see for example GB 2146787 A. For some
purposes it is desirable that the LCP shows a smectic C
(Sc) or chiral smectic C (Sc*) liquid crystal phase, and
a particularly preferred side chain for acheiving this
is one which contains a laterally fluorinated biphenyl
or terphenyl system. Liquid crystal polyacrylates are known, Polymer
Communications, 24, 364-365, 1988, having a polyacrylate
backbone, eg. polymethacrylate, with pendant side
chains, ie. of general structure:

Where (CH2)m-X is the side chain and R is hydrogen or
alkyl in the case of polyalkylacrylates, being methyl in
polymethacrylates.According to the present invention there is
provided a LCP material based on forked side
chain acrylates having improved liquid crystal properties
over known polyacrylates of similar structure, having a
general formula I;

wherein
W = H, CH3, Cln = 1 or n = 4R1 and R2 may or may not be the same but have the
following general srtucture: 
p = 2 to 14;q = 0 or 1;r =1 or 2;s = 1 or 2;X = O, CO2, O2C, CH2;Y = C2H4, O, CO2, O2C;Z = CN, halogen, R, CO2R, OR, O2CR, wherein R =
chiral or achiral.The general method of preparation of LCP's of
formula I is by polymerisation of a compound of general
structure:
Wherein R1 and R2 have the general structure
defined above. 4-hydroxy-4'cyanobiphenyl was refluxed with
11-bromo-1-undecanol and potassium carbonate in butanone
to 20 hours. The product was extracted from water into
dichloromethane, and purified by recrystallisation from
IMS.The product from step 1 was stirred at room temperature with malonic acid
in the presence of excess dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and dimethylaminopyridine
in dichloromethane for 24 hours. The product was recrystallised from ethanol.The product of step 2 is refluxed for 8 hours with
4-bromobutanol and sodium ethoxide in ethanol. The
product is purified by recrystallisation and/or column
