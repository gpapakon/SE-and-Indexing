<ABSTRACT>
A protecting cap is used for protecting a plurality of 
terminals standing in a cylindrical portion (30) of an 

electrical connector (10) held in a mounting hole (W) formed 
in a panel (P) so that an open end of the cylindrical 

portion (30) faces the mounting hole (W). The protecting 
cap is attached to the open end of the cylindrical portion 

(30). The protecting cap includes a lid portion (41) 
covering the open end of the cylindrical portion (30) of the 

connector (10) and a pair of engagement members (42; 43) 
attaching the lid portion (41) to the cylindrical portion 

(30) of the connector (10). The lid portion (41) has 
inclined faces (41a, 41b) each having a tapered 

configuration in the direction opposite the open end of the 
cylindrical portion. Since the protecting cap is tapered, 

it can be readily inserted into the mounting hole (W). Upon 
insertion of the distal end of the cap into the mounting 

hole (W), the connector can be guided to a normal position 
even when it is shifted relative to the mounting hole (W).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combination of an electrical
connector and a protecting cap for such a connector,
especially a panel-mounted electrical connector including a
cylindrical portion holding therein terminals and mounted
in a mounting hole formed in a panel with an open end of
the cylindrical portion facing the mounting hole, the protecting
cap covering the open end of the cylindrical portion
to protect the terminals therein.Electrical connectors of the art in question are disclosed
in e.g. EP-A-0 323 064, US-A-4,235,502 and US-A-5,139,431.An electrical connector or a combination of such an
electrical connector and a protecting cap therefor is typically
of the kind to be attached to panels composing a door
or a body of an automobile so that electric parts equipped
in the door are connected to the body side. FIG. 8 illustrates
a conventional panel-mounted electrical connector 1,
which has become prior art by common knowledge of an expert
in this art. The connector 1 includes a front bottomed cylindrical
hood 2. A plurality of male terminals 3 are held
on a inner wall of the hood 2 so as to project toward its
front open end. A flange 4 is formed on the outer periphery
near the front end of the hood 2. When the connector 1 is
inserted into a mounting hole W of a panel P, the flange 4
collides against panel P. A pair of slit-like notched portions
are formed in each of upper and lower walls to extend
from the open end toward the inner wall. Two locking arms 5
each formed into the shape of a plate with a small width
and having elasticity are provided between the respective
pairs of notched portions. Each locking arm 5 has a protrusion
6 formed on the outer peripheral side of its distal
end. Each protrusion 6 has an inclined front side and a
rear vertical end. A distance between the rear vertical
wall surface and the front end wall surface of the flange 4 
is so set as to be approximately equal to the thickness of
the panel P.Since the male connectors 3 project in the hood 2,
something foreign invading the hood 2 can strike against
the male connectors 3 during transportation such that some
or all the male connectors 3 bend. To prevent this, a protecting
cap 7 is attached to the open end of the hood 2 to
preliminarily close the end. The protecting cap 7 is inserted
into the open end of the hood 2 so that the connector
1 with the cap 7 being attached thereto can be mounted
on the panel P.When the connector is inserted into the mounting hole W
of the panel P with the protecting cap 7 being attached
thereto,

<CLAIMS>
A combination of an electrical connector and a protecting
cap therefor for attachement to an open end of said

electrical connector (10; 110), said electrical connector
(10; 110) having a cylindrical portion (30; 130) in which a

plurality of terminals projecting towards said open end
stand, said electrical connector furthermore being capable

of being held in a mounting hole (W) formed in a panel (P)
so that said open end of said cylindrical portion (30; 130)

faces the mounting hole (W), said protecting cap (40; 140)
having a lid portion (41; 141) for covering the open end of

the cylindrical portion (30; 130) of the connector (10;
110),

   characterized by

   said lid portion (41; 141) having inclined faces (41a,
41b; 141a, 141b) each having a tapered configuration in the

direction opposite to said open end of said cylindrical
portion (30; 130) and a pair of engagement members (42, 43;

142, 143) attaching the lid portion (41; 141) to the cylindrical
portion (30; 130) of the connector (10; 110).
The combination according to claim 1, characterized
in that each inclined face (41a, 41b) of the lid portion

(41) has a convex portion (46) the height of which is so
determined that the same extends within an outer periphery

of a lowest portion of the lid portion (41), the lowest
portion being opposite a tapered end of the lid portion

(41).
The combination according to claim 2, characterized
in that each convex portion (46) has elasticity such that

the same deforms in a direction in which the connector (10)
is inserted into the mounting hole (W). 
The combination according to claim 3, characterized
in that each convex portion (46) stands on the inclined

face (41a, 41b) so as to be inclined in a direction opposite
the direction in which the connector (10) is inserted

into the mounting hole (W).
The combination according to claim 1, characterized
in that the protecting cap (40) includes a pair of engagement

members (43) each projecting toward the open end of
the cylindrical portion (30) of said connector (10), each

engagement member (43) including an engagement protrusion
(44) projecting peripherally and that the inclined faces

(41a, 41b) formed on the protecting cap are located at
least at the outer peripheral side relative to distal ends

of the engagement members (43).
The combination according to claim 1, characterized
in that the lid portion (41) is swollen into the shape of a

box and the inclined faces (41a, 41b) are formed by notching
