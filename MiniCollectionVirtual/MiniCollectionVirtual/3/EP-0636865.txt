<ABSTRACT>
A lamp unit is provided with a projecting portion 
(128) on the inner wall of a lamphouse (118) in the 

vicinity of the arc portion (120) of a lamp (110). The 
lamphouse is ventilated by a fan (122) provided at one 

end of the lamphouse and a vent (126) provided at the 
other end. The inner diameter of the lamphouse at the 

arc portion provided with the projecting portion is 
smaller than that of the end portions, so that the flow 

velocity of the air passing through the lamphouse is 
higher in the vicinity of the arc portion. Even if the 

lamp (110) is horizontally installed, which lowers the 
heat dissipation efficiency, since the lamp (110) is 

adequately air-cooled, an extreme temperature rise is 
prevented. 
Furthermore a magnet is provided in the vicinity of the lamp to 
stabilize the arc of the horizontal arc lamp. As a bulb material for the 

lamp, quartz glass having a low transmission below 220nm is used. A 
cartridge (of e.g. ceramic) permits easy replacement of the lamp unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lamp unit and, more 
particularly, to an improvement of a cooling mechanism and a lamp 
replacing mechanism for a short arc type lamp. As a light source of an optical analyzer such as a fluorescence 
detector, short arc type lamps such as a xenon lamp, metal halide lamp 
and a mercury lamp are generally used. Fig. 5 shows a general structure of a xenon short arc type lamp 
(hereinunder referred to as "xenon lamp" ). As shown in Fig. 5, a xenon 
lamp 10 is composed of a long and narrow bulb 12, electrode bases 14a, 
14b into which both ends of the bulb 12 are fitted, and electrode cores 
16a, 16b implanted in the electrode bases 14a and 14b, respectively. A spherical bulb portion 13 filled with xenon gas is formed at 
the center of the bulb 12, and the tips of the electrode cores 16a and 
16b are in close proximity with each other in the spherical bulb portion 
13. A high voltage is applied to the electrode bases 14a, 14b so as 
to cause arc discharge between the electrode cores 16a and 16b and to 
light the xenon lamp 10 thereby.  When the xenon lamp 10 is lighted, a large quantity of heat is 
produced between the electrode cores 16a, 16b where arc discharge is 
caused, so that the temperature of the tube wall of the spherical bulb 
portion 13 rises. For example, in the case of a 150-W xenon lamp, the 
pressure in the spherical bulb portion 13 reaches as high as 40 to 50 
atm. Therefore, if the heat dissipation at the tube wall of the 
spherical bulb portion 13 is insufficient, there is a fear of the 
spherical bulb portion 13 bursting due to a temperature rise. If the temperature in the spherical bulb portion 13 abnormally 
rises, there is a fear that the property of the glass constituting the 
spherical bulb portion 13 changes, which may lead to what is called 
devitrification. The rise in the temperature of the tube wall of the spherical 
bulb portion 13 is different between in the lamp (hereinunder referred 
to as "vertically installed lamp" ) which is installed in a lamphouse 
18 in such a manner that the longitudinal portion of the bulb 12 is 
perpendicular to the bottom of the lamphouse 18, as shown in Fig. 6 and 
the lamp (hereinunder referred to as "horizontally installed lamp" ) 
which is installed in the lamphouse 18 in such a manner that the 
longitudinal portion of the bulb 12 is horizontal to the bottom of the 
lamphouse 18, as shown in Fig. 7. When the xenon lamp 10 is lighted, the convection current of the 
xenon gas indicated by the arrows in Figs. 6
