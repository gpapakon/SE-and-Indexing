The invention solves the object of developing a method of processing valuable biological substances by proposing to subject the valuable biological substance, other comminution, to a heat treatment and simultaneous drying treatment, followed by grinding or separating the substance into a waste fraction and into a recyclable fraction. The method according to the invention allows valuable biological substances which are obtained under economically favourable conditions to give recyclable substances.
