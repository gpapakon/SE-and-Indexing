<ABSTRACT>
A silicon nitride-based sinter contains 0.1 to 1.5 % by 
weight of Mg, 0.1 to 3.5 % by weight of Al, 0.01 to 6 % by 

weight of carbon, and 0.2 to 5 % by weight of oxygen, the 
balance consisting essentially of silicon, nitrogen, and 

impurities. This sinter can be obtained by sintering a 
ceramic mixture comprising 0.5 to 6 % by weight of a 

MgO.Al₂O₃ spinel structure, 0.1 to 20 % by weight of silicon 
carbide, not more than 1 % by weight of silicon oxide, and 

carbide substantially of silicon nitride and impurities. 
By incorporating the MgO.Al₂O₃ spinel structure and silicon 

carbide, the silicon nitride-based ceramic products acquire 
significantly improved ability to resist acid and/or alkali 

corrosion but without significantly impairing the inherent 
characteristics of silicon nitride sintered ceramics, such 

as strength, resistance to abrasion, and resistance to heat.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to silicon nitride-based sinters
which provide good resistance to chemicals, and a method for the production thereof as indicated in the appended claims 1-11.Ceramic sinters having silicon nitride as a main
component thereof possess various desirable properties such
as very high heat resistance, a small thermal expansion
coefficient, and excellent resistance to thermal shock.
There are attempts to use these ceramic sinters in engine
parts, machine parts made of steel and the like as high-temperature
structural materials to replace conventional
heat-resistant alloys. Further, since they can have
excellent frictional resistance, efforts continue to make
use of these ceramic sinters in sliding members and cutting
tools.Generally, silicon nitride is a ceramic material of
rather poor sintering properties. Silicon nitride powder
prepared as a raw material for sintering can have improved
sintering properties by including a sintering auxiliary,
such as a rare earth element oxide or aluminium oxide, in a
prescribed amount to permit production of a ceramic sinter
with both high density and high strength. By way of known
examples of sintering composition (i.e. their raw material
composition) for silicon nitride-based ceramics, there are
Si3N4-Y2O3 type compositions, Si3N4-Y2O3-Al2O3-AlN type
compositions, and Si3N4-Y2O3-Al2O3 oxide of Ti,Mg or Zr type
compositions.In the sintering compositions mentioned above, yttrium
oxide and other similar rare earth element oxides and
aluminium oxide improve silicon nitride sintering properties
and enhance densification of silicon nitride sinters.
Silicon nitride-based sinters manufactured from raw
materials incorporating a rare earth element oxide or
aluminium oxide can have a dense texture with attractive
mechanical strength properties. Measures have been adopted
to improve mechanical properties and frictional resistance
of silicon nitride sinters at elevated temperatures, by
incorporating a combination of a plurality of kinds of
compounds such as aluminium nitride and titanium oxide with 
the raw material powder.Silicon nitride-based sinters which have such sintering
compositions as mentioned above, however, are almost
universally deficient in resistance to corrosion caused by
such chemicals as acids and alkalis. When used as
structural materials in an environment exposed or subjected
to such chemicals there is a problem concerning the expected
durability and/or reliability of the sinters. Particularly,
the rare earth oxides are at a disadvantage in
