<ABSTRACT>
A process for preparing fluorocarbon 
fluoroalkanesulfonates comprises (a) forming a mixture 

comprising at least one fluoroalkanesulfonyl halide, 
e.g., perfluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride, at least one 

fluorocarbon-substituted carbinol, e.g., 1,1-dihydroperfluorobutoxyethoxyethanol, 
and at least one 

base, e.g., triethyl amine; and (b) allowing the 
mixture to react in the absence of solvent at a 

temperature below ambient. The process is volume-efficient 
and provides high yields of fluorocarbon 

fluoroalkanesulfonates useful as intermediates in, 
e.g., drug synthesis.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
preparing fluorocarbon fluoroalkanesulfonate esters,
e.g., 1,1-dihydroperfluorobutoxyethoxyethyl
perfluoromethanesulfonate.Fluorocarbon fluoroalkanesulfonate esters
have utility as intermediates, e.g., in the synthesis
of drugs such as antibiotics (see, e.g., S. Sakamoto et
al., J. Antibiotics 37 (12), 1628-34 (1984)). These
compounds have often been prepared by the reaction of a
fluoroalkanesulfonic anhydride with a fluorine-containing
alcohol in the presence of a base such as
pyridine, as described, e.g., by P. G. Gassman et al.,
J. Org. Chem. 1984, 49, 2258-73 (at page 2270).Fluorocarbon fluoroalkanesulfonates have also
been prepared by reaction of a fluoroalkanesulfonyl
halide (rather than the corresponding anhydride) with a
fluorine-containing alcohol in the presence of base, as
described, e.g., by Sakamoto et al., supra, at page
1631, by V. G. DeVries et al., J. Med. Chem. 26, 1411-21
(at page 1417)(1983), and in U.S. Pat. No. 3,419,595
(Hansen). These references disclose the general use of
a solvent such as methylene chloride and the use of
various different reaction temperatures. DE-A-24 40 272 describes perfluoroalkane sulfonic acid
esters of Formula (I)

wherein
R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, optionally
substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl;Rf is perfluoroalkyl or perfluorocycloalkyl;n is 0 or 1;X1 and X2 are independently nitro or halogen, but are not
fluorine, if R1 and R2 are hydrogen;X3 is hydrogen, alkyl or aryl if n is 0, and is nitro or
halogen if n is 1, but is not fluorine if R1 and R2 are
hydrogen;X4 and X5 are independently nitro or halogen, but are not
fluorine, if R1 and R2 are hydrogen.The present invention relates to the subject-matter
disclosed in the claims.Briefly, in one aspect, this invention
provides a process for preparing fluorocarbon
fluoroalkanesulfonates. The process comprises (a)
forming a mixture comprising at least one
fluoroalkanesulfonyl halide, e.g.,
perfluoromethanesulfonyl fluoride, at least one
fluorocarbon-monosubstituted carbinol, e.g., 1,1-dihydroperfluorobutoxyethoxyethanol,
and at least one
base, e.g., triethyl amine; and (b) allowing the
mixture to react in the absence of solvent at a
temperature below ambient. The mixture is preferably
allowed to react at a temperature in the range of from
-40°C to +15°C. As used herein, the term
fluorocarbon includes fluoroalkyl, fluorocycloalkyl,
and fluoroether groups.The process of the invention utilizes
fluoroalkanesulfonyl halides, rather than the higher
