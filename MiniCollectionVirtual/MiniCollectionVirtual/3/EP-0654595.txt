<ABSTRACT>
A piston for internal combustion type alternating engines 
of the type comprising a load-bearing cylindrical body 

with a seat (2,3) for a transverse gudgeon pin (4) which links the 
piston with the small end of the connecting rod, as well 

as with one or more grooves (5,6) in the skirt (9) of the piston to 
receive one or more piston rings. The gudgeon pin seat (3) is 

in such position that the projection of said seat onto the 
skirt (9) of the piston intersects at least one of said 

grooves (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a piston for alternating
type volumetric engines and, in particular, an internal
combustion engine piston with skirt comprising seats on
bosses to support the gudgeon pin linking with the small
end of the connecting rod.In internal combustion engines, as in other volumetric
engines, the force due to the fluid expanding inside the
cylinder is transferred to the crankshaft by the piston.The seal between the piston and the cylinder in which it
moves is ensured by one or more piston rings, lodged in
circumferential grooves on the external surface of the
skirt in the upper part of the piston. The piston is
connected to the connecting rod by a transverse pin which
is generally floating i.e. not bonded to the piston or
connecting rod, in a suitable seat below the grooves.The pin is held in position by a pair of elastic snap
rings, one at each end, such as Seeger type safety lock
rings lodged in circumferential grooves in the pin bore,
or is locked by plugs forced into the ends of the pin
itself.Similar systems of retaining the pin, although widely
used, are the source of drawbacks, especially in high-performance
engines; e.g. the thermal and mechanical
stresses tend to alter the characteristics of the
retention devices and cause them to leave their respective 
seats with consequent irreparable damage to the piston and
cylinder.In recently constructed engines and in particular in high-performance
competition engines, the tendency is to use
light pistons in which there is a reduction in both the
total surface area and the height of the skirt in parts of
the piston not subject to stresses between the piston and
cylinder i.e. in correspondence of the gudgeon pin
bosses.One of the main drawbacks of the presently known pistons
is that the piston in its movement inside the cylinder
oscillates about the gudgeon pin axis because the centre
of mass of the piston is not in line with that axis. This
leads inevitably to some of the power being absorbed in
vibration and friction and/or frictional wear on the
reciprocating parts.The oscillating movement and the consequent vibration
increases as the distance between the centre of mass of
the piston and the axis of the gudgeon pin increases. It
is possible to produce a piston where the centre of mass
is in line with the axis of the gudgeon pin, but this
increases the weight of the piston and reduces the
performance of the engine. GB-A-429070 discloses a piston according to the preamble of claim 1, i. e. a piston
in which at least a part of the

<CLAIMS>
A piston (1) for reciprocating internal combustion engines, of the
type comprising a load-bearing cylindrical body with at least two bosses

(2, 3) forming a seat for a transverse gudgeon pin (4) adapted for
connection to the small end of a connecting rod, as well as one or more

grooves (5, 6) in the piston skirt (9) to receive one or more piston rings (12,
13), at least a part of the gudgeon pin seat being located at a distance

from the upper edge (8) of the piston (1) that is less than the distance of at
least one (6) of said grooves from the upper edge of the piston, and in

such a position that the projection of said seat onto the skirt (9) of the
piston (1) intersects at least one (6) of said grooves, characterised in that it

comprises at least one bored access hole (10) corresponding to the
projection of said seat onto the skirt (9) of the piston (1), and at least one

plug (11) inserted into said at least one access hole (10), said plug (11)
bearing against an extremity of the gudgeon pin (4) to retain said pin in

position into its seat.
A piston according to Claim 1, characterised in that it comprises
two of said access holes (10', 10") in diametrically opposed positions with

respect to the seat of said gudgeon pin (4) and two of said plugs (11', 11")
fitted in a floating manner in said access holes.
A piston according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the outer
surface of said plug or plugs (11; 11', 11") which faces the skirt (9) forms

part of the surface of the skirt itself and comprising a recessed groove
portion in correspondence with the groove or grooves (5, 6) on the skirt

(9). 
A piston according to Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that each of
said plugs (11', 11") bears against one end of the gudgeon pin (4) within

the supporting boss (2, 3) of the pin itself to hold the same in its correct
position.
A piston according to any of the preceding Claims, characterised
by having means (12, 13) for preventing said plugs (11; 11', 11") from

being rotated by said gudgeon pin (4).
A piston according to any of the preceding claims, characterised
by comprising means for holding said plugs (11; 11', 11") inserted into the

respective access hole (10; 10', 10").
