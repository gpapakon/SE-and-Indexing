<ABSTRACT>
A shell-type centrifuge rotor includes a body member (12) 
having an upturned lip (12L) and a plate (24) having a skirt portion 

(24S) attached to the body. The skirt portion has a groove (24G) therein 
that overlies the lip (12L) on the body. The groove defines a 

relatively high stress region of likely failure of the rotor. A 
seal (38) is disposed in the groove, the seal extending between the 

plate and the lip. Failure of the rotor in the vicinity of the 
groove (24G) in the skirt portion (24S) at a first operating 

speed defining 
an opening through which a portion of the seal (38) may protrude. 

The protruding portion of the seal (38) generates a force tending to 
lower the speed of the rotor below the first operating speed. 

The radially inner surface (38I) of the seal ring (38) is 
inclined toward 

the axis of rotation. The radially inner boundary surface (24BI) of the 
groove (24G) is parallel to or inclined radially inwardly toward the 

axis of rotation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a shell-type centrifuge
rotor.So-called shell-type rotors are well known in the centrifuge
art. In the typical instance a shell-type rotor
includes a generally planar body member onto which is
attached an upper plate. The upper plate has an array of
openings sized to accept sample containers. When received
in the openings in the plate the containers project
into an open space defined between the upper surface
of the body member and the undersurface of the
plate.US-A-4,449,965 is believed a representative example of
such a rotor construction. Typically, no seal is provided
between the body and the plate. In the rotor disclosed
in US-A-4,832,679 the radially outer peripheral
region of the body curves inwardly toward the axis of
rotation to define a trough. The trough serves to trap
liquid which may escape from the containers into the
open space.A centrifuge rotor corresponding to the precharacterizing
part of claim 1 is generally disclosed in
EP-A-0 456 898 A3. This rotor has a body member with an
upturned lip, and a mold body situated above the body
member and having a third portion that overlies the lip
of the lower body portion. The lip and the skirt portion
directly engage each other for providing a centering and
sealing contact of both parts. Again, there is no seal
member provided between the body and the upper member. DE-C-36 01 789 describes a shell-type centrifuge rotor
comprising body member having troughs for inserting
centrifuge tubes, and a plate member to be mounted on
the body for covering the body and the centrifuge tubes
supported thereon. The body has at its outer circumference
an upstanding lip having a groove in which a seal
ring is disposed. The upper plate member comprises a
depending skirt that presses against the seal member if
the plate is mounted on the body in position. Thereby,
the gap between the body and the plate is sealed, but
droplets may migrate under the centrifuging force past
the seal ring.Owing to its relatively low cost of manufacture a shell-type
rotor is a popular rotor choice when a clinician is
presented with the task of spinning a relatively small
sized sample (on the order of two milliliters). Moreover,
a shell-type rotor may be used for protocols that
extend into the superspeed regime, with rotational
speeds on the order of fifteen thousand rpm being typical.As with any rotor, there is a possibility that a shell-type
rotor may fail in operation. Typical causes of
failure include fracture due to fatigue or due to excessive
forces

<CLAIMS>
A shell-type centrifuge rotor rotatable about an
axis of rotation (VCL) for use in a centrifuge instrument,

the rotor comprising:

a body member (12) having an upturned lip (12L), and
a plate (24) attached to the body, the plate having
a skirt portion (24S) thereon, the skirt portion

(24S) overlying the lip (12L) on the body,
the skirt portion having an underside with a groove
(24G) formed therein, the groove (24G) having a radially

inner boundary surface (24B-1) with an edge
that is parallel to or inclined radially inwardly

toward the axis of rotation,
characterized in that
a seal ring (38) is disposed in the groove (24G) of
the skirt (24S), the seal ring extending between the

plate (24) and the lip (12L), the seal ring (38)
having a radially inner surface (38I) and a radially

outer surface (38S) thereon, the radially inner surface
of the seal ring terminating in a tip (38T),

the tip extending to the groove (24G) past the edge
of the radially inner boundary (24B-1) surface of

the groove, and the radially inner surface (38I) of
the seal ring (38) is inclined radially inwardly

toward the axis of rotation.
The rotor of claim 1 wherein the radially inner
boundary surface (24-B1) of the groove (24G) is parallel

to the axis of rotation (VCL).
The rotor of claim 1 wherein the radially inner
boundary surface (24-B1) of the groove is inclined

radially inwardly toward the axis of rotation (VCL).
The rotor of claim 1 wherein the radially inner surface
(38I) of the seal ring (38) is inclined radially

inwardly toward the axis of rotation (VCL).
The rotor of one of claims 1-4 wherein the skirt
(24S) has a reduced thickness at the groove (24G),

such that at a first operating speed, sufficient
stress on the groove is generated to cause the rotor

to fail at the groove (24G) and form an opening (46)
through the groove, thus permitting a portion (38P)

of the seal ring (38) to protrude through the opening
(46) to reduce the speed of the rotor below the

first operating speed.
The rotor of claim 5 wherein the protruding portion
of the seal ring (38) contacts against the bowl (B)

of a centrifuge instrument to generate a frictional
force tending to lower the speed of the rotor below

the first operating speed.
