<ABSTRACT>
A multifunction delivery unit for an irrigation pistol 
comprises a supporting casing (17) that can be fastened to one 

end of a delivery pipe (2) of the pistol with a diffusion 
passage of the spray (19) placed in front of a delivery nozzle 

(6) obtained at said end of the pipe (2), a spray selector (21) 
that supports a plurality of delivery elements (26-29) suitable 

for delivering sprays of different shapes and that is mounted 
rotatably on said supporting casing (17) so that it can be 

rotated with respect to it in order to position a delivery 
element (26-29) selected as the case may be at the outlet from 

said passage (19), and means (36-40) for holding said selector 
(21) in the position selected as the case may be.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multifunction delivery
unit for irrigation pistol.It is known that irrigation pistols comprise a delivery pipe
connected to a hollow handgrip through which the irrigation
liquid arrives.The delivery pipe ends at the front with a mouth at the
centre of which there is a nozzle for delivering the irrigation
liquid.Inside the delivery pipe there is a mobile member for
opening and closing the nozzle, which member is operated from
the outside by means of suitable operating levers.The regulation of the flow of liquid is obtained by
operating the member for opening and closing the nozzle.A similar pistol is described in the United States patent
No. 4448355. The spray delivered by this pistol, however, has
a substantially circular shape, with a surface that is larger
or smaller in relation to the degree by which the nozzle is
open.Irrigation pistols are also known on whose delivery mouth it
is possible to manually fit delivery members that are
interchangeable one with the other and that are suitable for
obtaining sprays with a shape other than circular, for example 
like a fan or a sprinkle, so as to allow the use of the pistol
in various situations.To change an irrigation member the user must, however,
proceed to dismantle it manually from the mouth of the pistol
and subsequently mount a different irrigation element.US-A-4903897, US-A-4666089, US-A-5232162 and GB-A-2136710
disclose multifunction delivery units for irrigation guns
substantially as defined in the preamble of claim 1. In view of the described state of the art, the object of the
present invention is to provide an irrigation pistol wherein it
is possible to vary the shape of the delivered spray and wherein the means for holding
the selected spray are of simple construction,According to the invention, such object is attained thanks
to a multifunction delivery unit further comprising the features defined in the
characterizing part of claim 1.Thanks to the present invention, it is possible to provide 
an irrigation pistol wherein the shape of the spray can be
varied by the user himself, simply by positioning the desired
delivery element in front of the nozzle of the pipe of the
pistol and which would be cheap to manufacture.These and other features of the present invention will be
made more evident by the following detailed description of two
embodiments thereof, illustrated as non-limiting examples in
the enclosed drawings, wherein:
