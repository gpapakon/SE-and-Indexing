<ABSTRACT>
A conductive polymer wraparound sleeve (5) is used to enclose a joint between district heating pipes. It is wrapped so that longitudinal edges thereof overlap, and it acts as a source of heat to seal the overlapping longitudinal edges. Elongate electrodes (7, 8), preferably metal bars provided on a carrying strip, are positioned along the overlap (6) and connected to a power source to cause electrical current to flow circumferentially across the overlap region to cause bonding of the overlap.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONThe present invention relates to environmental protection and /or mechanical joining of pipes or cables, particularly thermally-insulated pipes such as district-heating pipes.The product consists of a heat-shrink backing, shrink ratio preferably from 10 - 50% for example about 20%. The backing may be electrically conductive with a resistivity around 1 - 10 ohm cm especially from 2 - 6 ohm cm. Preferably the material comprises a conductive polymeric material. A conductive polymeric material is a composition comprising a particulate conductive, filler, typically carbon black, distributed in a polymer, typically an organic polymer. The filler is preferably provided in an amount of 20-60 parts by weight. The polymer may be for example polyethylene or EVA. A preferred material is 100 - 500%, particularly 300% expanded, 0.75 - 2.5 particularly 1.5 mm thick sheet made in polyethylene or EVA 30 - 50%, particularly 39% carbon filled.The product is wraparound and can be supplied on the roll or cut to length in the field or elsewhere. The product can replace oversized casings used in district heating joints.Thus, the present invention in one embodiment provides the use of a conductive polymer backing sheet in the environmental protection of a thermally-insulated pipe to enclose the pipe and to act as a source of heat to seal overlapping longitudinal edges of the sheet.In another embodiment the invention provides a method of sealing an elongate object which comprises: wrapping a sheet comprising a conductive polymer backing sheet and a bonding layer around the object so that longitudinal edges thereof overlap over a longitudinal region; pressing two electrodes into contact with the sheet so that they extend substantially parallel to each other along opposite edge portions of the sheet; powering the 

electrodes to cause electrical current to flow across the region to fuse the bonding layer.The product can be installed over a cut back between two joined district heating pipes. A support plate or profile can be installed in the cut back area. This plate can support a longitudinal seal formed during installation of the new sheet.The sheet can be wrapped around the cut back and closed with a cotton Tessa or other suitable tape.Two metal bars, e.g. aluminium bars may be used as electrodes. These are typically spaced at 25-45, particularly about 35 mm with electrical isolators. The electrodes are positioned over an overlap of ends of the sheet and optionally over a metal or other support. They

CLAIMS
1. The use of a conductive polymer backing sheet in the environmental protection of a thermally-insulated pipe to enclose the pipe or cable and to act as a source of heat to seal overlapping longitudinal edges of the sheet.
2. The use of a sheet according to claim 1, in which the sheet is coated with a heat-activatable sealing material that can be activated by heat generated within the sheet thereby forming the seal.
3. The use of a sheet according to claim 2, in which the sealing material is reinforced.
4. The use of a sheet according to claim 3, in which the sealing material comprises a fibre-reinforced fusion layer.
5. The use of a sheet according to any preceding claim, in which the sheet is heaf-shrinkable, heat generated within the sheet optionally causing its heat-shrinkage-
6. The use of a sheet according to any preceding claim in a method which comprises
(1) positioning the sheet around the pipe such that longitudinal edges of the sheet overlap one another;
(2) applying electrical power between two regions of the sheet that (a) each extend substantially longitudinally along the sheet and (b) substantially enclose at least part of the overlap.
7. The use of a sheet according to claim 6, in which electrical power is applied by means of electrodes placed over an outwardly- facing surface of an edge of the sheet.

8. A method of sealing an elongate object which comprises: wrapping a sheet comprising a conductive polymer backing sheet and a bonding layer around the object so that longitudinal edges thereof overlap over a longitudinal region; pressing two elongate electrodes into contact with the sheet so-that they extend substantially parallel to each other along opposite edge portions of the sheet; powering the electrodes to cause electrical current to flow across the region to fuse the bonding layer.
9. A method according to claim 8, wherein the two electrodes are secured to an elongate backing sheet, which thereby provides an integral device that on use is applied to the sheet to cause the electrical current flow, and then optionally is removed.
