<ABSTRACT>
An improved electrical connector for use in electronic 
assemblies to link electronic components in order to transmit 

electric signals or current. The connector (10) includes a wafer 
interface connective construction with at least one 

resiliently compressible contact (34) to provide a means across 
which electrical current can flow from one male pin (38) to another 

male pin (56) without placing the pins in direct contact with each 
other. The contact (34) retains its form and resiliency through 

its non-compressive retainment within the aperture of the 
wafer interface connective construction. Engagement and 

disengagement of the connector is facilitated, yet reliability 
and conductivity are enhanced. Further, the size and weight 

of the connector is reduced, and the assembly of the connector 
is facilitated. In addition, the pin contacts and the 

retainment components for the pin contacts are common to both 
halves of the connector which eliminates the need for socket 

contacts and their associated components.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application continues in part subject matter which 
is disclosed in the co-pending application of Richard Jay 
Lindeman, U.S. Serial No. 07/647,907, filed January 30, 1991, 
which is a continuation in part of U.S. Serial No. 518,295, 
filed May 3, 1990, now U.S. Patent No. 4,988,306. This application also continues in part subject matter 
which is disclosed in the copending application of Richard Jay 
Lindeman, Serial No. 07/647,865, filed January 30, 1991, which 
is a continuation in part of U.S. Serial No. 518,295, filed 
May 3, 1990, now U.S. Patent No. 4,988,306. The present invention relates generally to electrical 
connectors and more particularly concerns electrical connector 
assemblies with wadded wire contacts, recessed in apertures in 
an interface module, for the transmission of electric current 
between male pins touching the wadded wire contact on opposite 
sides. Electronic assemblies generally require multiple 
electrical connections such that electrical signals and 
current can flow from either a power source or a component 
with electrical signals to other components of the assembly 
via wires and cables. In those electronic assemblies, and 
particularly those used in the air transportation industry, 
durable and reliable connections must be made between the 
electrical components in order to properly transmit electrical 
signals and current. Many different types of electrical 
connectors have been used or proposed in the prior art. A common type of electrical connector is the pin and 
socket connector. Unfortunately, the pin and socket connector 
has been shown to have certain disadvantages. The pin and 
socket connector lacks the ability to provide efficient and 
reliable transmission of signals. Specifically, auxiliary  
 
contact area between the male and female contacts is critical 
to insure that a reliable connection is sustained in all 
conditions. For example, under conditions of vibration, as is typical 
in the air transportation industry, the need for a large 
contact area between the male and female contacts is 
essential. If contact is lost along one point of the contact 
area due to vibration, the auxiliary contact area assures the 
existence of contact at other points of the contact area. In 
addition, the possible presence of impurities in the contact 
area accumulated either during the manufacturing process or 
from environmental exposure also compels the designer to 
increase the contact area to prevent an interruption in the 
flow of signals or current. The risk
