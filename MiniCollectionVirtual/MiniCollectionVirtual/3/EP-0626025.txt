<DESCRIPTION>
US-A-5,088,214, is not to be regarded as state of the art for the present invention.This invention relates to a lock assembly for a
wearable structure and, more particularly, to a replaceable
assembly consisting of a base part and a wear part for
protecting a face of a structure engageable with abrasive
material. The face so protected is usually flat, i.e., planar
or slightly arcuate, as contrasted to the lip or wing protected
by the wear part in the above-identified application.The invention finds utility in connection, for example,
with excavating equipment, ore chutes used in mining and other
structures subject to abrasive wear.From US-A-4 748 754 an assembly is know which comprises a base part, a wear
and a lock. The base part and the wear part can be coupled together and are
fixedly held in this position by the lock.The continuing problem is
to provide a part that engages the abrasive material which is
securely locked in place during operation yet which is easily
replaced when worn. The locks of the prior art often employed
resilient keepers or plugs engageable with a pin and imposition
of shock loads in combination with abrasion resulted in lock
deterioration. Other locking procedures made replacement more
difficult as did the welded stops of co-owned patent RE 33,454. 
It is an object of the invention to provide an assembly, that allows to replace easily
the wear part when worn and that locks the wear part securely in place during
operation. This object is achieved by the subject matters of independent claims 1,
18 and 19. Embodiments of the invention and improvements are indicated in the
subclaims. The invention is described in conjunction with several
illustrative embodiments, in the accompanying drawing, in which --

opening (141c) between opposite first and second ends of said boss (129) to receive

the lock (40).
The assembly of any of claims 1-9 in which one of said boss or wear
part (330) includes spaced apart boss-like projections (342) each having a portion of

the transverse wall associated with said one boss or wear part (330), the other of
said boss or wear part (329) including a boss-like projection (341) aligned with the

space between the said one boss or wear part boss-like projections (342), said other

with said other boss or wear part (329). 
The assembly of any of claims 1-10 which further includes a keeper (46)
for retaining the lock (40) in said opening (43).
The assembly of claim 11 in which said keeper (46) includes a tab with
