<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for the production of an emulsifiable polypropylene wax having a melt viscosity from 1000 to 5000 cP at 190  C. This process entails reacting at a temperature below 190  C a thermally degraded polypropylene wax having a melt viscosity below 1000 cP (at 190  C) with maleic anhydride in the presence of a f ree radical source. Floor polish formulations containing this polypropylene wax are very clear but yet provide floor finishes that are very tough.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel process for 
producing a maleated polypropylene wax with high melt 
viscosity from which high clarity emulsions can be 
prepared. Grafting of high and low molecular weight polymers 
has been reported often in the literature [see for 
example, polymer textbook "Polymer Chemistry" by M. P. 
Stevens, (Addison-Wesley), 1975, pp 196-202]. Maleation 
is a subgroup of grafting. Those skilled in the art 
recognize the highly individualistic nature of the 
maleation processes which have been patented. For 
example, direct maleation of polyethylenes results in 
cross-linking which increases the molecular weight of 
the polymer [see for example, "Journal of Applied 
Polymer Science", 44, 1941, N. G. Gaylord et al (1992); 
and U.S. Patents 4,026,967, 4,028,436, 4,031,062, 
4,071,494, 4,218,263, 4,315,863, 4,347,341, 4,358,564, 
4,376,855, 4,506,056, 4,632,962, 4,780,228, 4,987,190, 
and 5,021,510]. Often free radical initiated maleation 
of polyethylenes is limited to very low acid numbers in 
order to prevent gelation due to excessive crosslinking. 
Thermal maleations without the use of initiators is also 
employed for maleation of polyethylenes in order to 
minimize crosslinking. Other techniques such as the 
addition of chain transfer agents or special reagents 
have been reported. On the other hand maleation of 
polypropylenes progresses easily with freeradical 
initiation (see U.S. Patents 3,414,551, 3,480,580, 
3,481,910, 3,642,722, 3,746,676, 3,932,368, and  
 
4,613,679). The molecular weight of the products of 
such reactions are lower than that of the starting 
polypropylene due to accompanying degradation reactions. Different techniques of maleation yield different 
product types. Solid state maleations, those carried 
out below the melting point of the polymer, occur on the 
exposed surface of the solid. The acid numbers attained 
are necessarily a function of exposed surface area. 
Solvent based processes dissolve the polymer and produce 
a much more uniform maleated product [see U.S. 
Patents 3,416,990, 3,437,550, 3,483,276, 3,928,687, 
4,078,017, 4,299,754, 4,624,992, and 4,693,838 and 
Japanese Patents 59 105,053, 84 105,053 (1984), 
69 15,422 (1969), 69 15,423 (1969), 77 93,495 (1977), 
80 34,224 (1980), and 82 42,736 (1982). Solvent removal 
and recycling is an added expense of such processes 
however. An extruder serves as the reactor in some 
processes and providessome decrease in the molecular 
weight of the polymer due to mechanical tearing of the 
polymer
