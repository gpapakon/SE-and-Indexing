<ABSTRACT>
A saw (10) comprises a frame, a table (12) mounted in the frame 
and adapted to adopt two positions. A pivot member (14) is on a 

first side of the table and a saw assembly (16) is pivoted (at 18) to 
the pivot member. A blade (26) is journalled in the assembly and a 

motor (22) drives the blade. An upper guard (32) covers an upper 
portion of the blade and is pivoted to the assembly, while a lower 

guard (40) covers a lower portion of the blade. A slot in the table 
permits the blade to protrude through the table. 
In a first of said two positions of the table, the saw assembly is 
above the table and the saw is a chop saw for performing plunge cuts 

on workpieces supported on said first side of the table (Figure 1). In 
a second of said two positions, the saw assembly is below the table 

and the saw is a bench saw for performing cuts on workpieces 
passed through the blade on a second opposite side of the table 

(Figure 2). A parallelogram lever (34) has a pivotal connection to 
the pivot member (at 38) and upper guard (at 36) whereby the 

orientation of the upper guard to the table is maintained. An 
extension (118) of the parallelogram lever has a rack (150) which, in 

bench saw mode, engages a worm gear (152) turnable by a knob to 
effect an adjustment to the depth of cut of the blade.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to circular saws of the type comprising a 
table, a pivot member on the table and a saw assembly pivoted about 
a pivot axis with respect to said pivot member, whereby said saw 
assembly carrying a motor driven blade can be plunged into a 
workpiece supported on the table. Such saws are known and described in published patent 
documents such as EP 0133666 and EP 0450400. These saws are 
useful and have numerous possibilities for enhancement to improve 
the capacity, capability and efficiency, not to mention cleanliness 
and safety of their arrangements. On the other hand, all these 
features add complexity and cost, and may render the saw user 
unfriendly. The present invention particularly relates to saws of the type 
described above but which in addition have the table mounted in a 
frame such that the table may be inverted, as by pivoting about an 
axis, so that the saw assembly is then beneath the table. The table is 
in addition provided with a slot so that the blade can protrude 
through the slot to render the saw a bench or table saw. Such saws 
are known and described in DE 1628992 and EP 0502350. Both EP 0133666 and EP 0450400 mentioned above describe 
saws in which the saw assembly comprises an upper guard and a 
lower guard for the blade. The upper guard is formed from the 
housing of the assembly and permanently covers a top part of the  
 
blade. A bottom part of the blade is covered by the lower guard but 
this must be withdrawn in use so that the blade is exposed when 
required to perform cutting operations. A handle is disposed on the upper guard by means of which a 
user can pivot the saw assembly up and down to perform cutting 
operations on a workpiece supported on the table. The lower guard may be opened entirely by an actuating lever 
disposed on said handle. Alternatively the guard may be opened 
automatically by pivoting of the saw assembly, there being provided 
a connection between the guard and the pivot member for this 
purpose. A further alternative is that the guard may be opened partly 
by either of these arrangements and only further opened by direct 
contact with a workpiece. Although not explicitly described in EP 0450400, the saw to 
which that specification relates employs a parallelogram lever 
arrangement. The upper guard is pivoted with respect to the saw 
assembly. A parallelogram lever extends between the upper guard 
and the pivot member and lies parallel a line joining the pivot axis of 
the guard to the assembly and the pivot axis of the

<CLAIMS>
A saw comprising a frame, a table mounted in the frame and 
adapted to adopt two positions, a pivot member on a first side of the 

table, a saw assembly pivoted with respect to the pivot member, a 
blade journalled in said assembly, a motor to drive the blade, an 

upper guard to cover an upper portion of the blade, which upper 
guard is pivoted to said assembly, a slot in the table through which 

said blade is adapted to protrude, in a first of said two positions of 
the table the saw assembly being above the table, the saw thereby 

forming a chop saw for performing plunge cuts on workpieces 
supported on said first side of the table, and, in a second of said two 

positions of the table, the saw assembly being below the table and 
the saw thereby forming a bench saw for performing cuts on 

workpieces passed through the blade on a second opposite side of 
the table, a parallelogram lever having a pivotal connection to the 

pivot member and upper guard whereby the orientation of said upper 
guard with respect to said pivot member is maintained, and an 

extension of said parallelogram lever which, when the saw assembly 
is in its second position, is adapted to co-operate with said pivot 

member through an adjustment means so that the position of said 
saw assembly with respect to the pivot member is controlled by said 

adjustment means. 
A saw as claimed in claim 1, in which said adjustment means 

comprises a worm gear rotationally mounted in a carrier member,  
 

which carrier member is adjustably connected to said pivot member, 
and said extension has a rack to engage said worm gear, rotation of 

the worm gear when engaged with said rack serving to pivot said 
parallelogram lever about its pivot to the pivot member to alter the 

depth of protrusion of the blade through the slot. 
A saw as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in which spring means are 
provided between the pivot member and saw assembly to bias the 

saw assembly away from the table, and wherein the spring means 
acts on an intermediate element disposed between the pivot member 

and saw assembly, the intermediate element having two dispositions, 
in a first of which dispositions said spring means supports the weight 

of said saw assembly when the table is in its first position and in a 
second of which dispositions said bias is substantially removed. 
A saw as claimed in claim 3, in which said carrier member is 
pivoted to said pivot member and said intermediate element 

comprises a toggle lever pivoted to the pivot member, which toggle 
lever in said first disposition tensions said spring means and, in 

pivoting to said second disposition, releases said tension and pivots 
said carrier into engagement with said extension. 
A saw as claimed in claim 4 in which said carrier and toggle 
lever are pivoted about the same axis in said pivot member. 
A saw as claimed in claim 4 or 5, in which said spring means 
comprises a torsion spring around the pivot axis of the saw assembly 

in the pivot member, one end of said spring pressing against the saw 
assembly and the other end engaging said toggle lever.  

 
A saw as claimed in claim 6, in which an intermediate lever is 
disposed between said other end of the spring and said toggle lever. 
A saw as claimed in claim 7, in which said other end of the 
spring is pivoted to said intermediate lever about a first axis, said 

intermediate lever is pivoted to said intermediate element about a 
second axis and said intermediate element is pivoted to said pivot 

member about a third axis, said axes being parallel and a line joining 
said first and second axes lying to one side of said third axis in said 

first disposition of said spring and to the other side of said third axis 
in said second disposition. 
A saw as claimed in any of claims 3 to 8, in which said spring 
means is neutral in said second disposition.
