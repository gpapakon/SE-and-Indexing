<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing an electrophotographic 
printing-use developer by mixing components of toner 

material, fusing and kneading the toner material, and then 
crushing and classifying the toner material, includes the 

step of arranging carbon black which is one of the 
components of the toner material to contain water before 

the mixing step. This arrangement permits even dispersion 
of water in the mixture of the components, prevents the 

flowability of the mixture from being lowered, and 
achieves stable kneading. Therefore, improved dispersion 

of the components is achieved. Since water adsorption is 
stable, water-treated carbon showing reduced water 

segregation is obtained. Consequently, high quality less 
foggy images with high resolution ar
e obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
preparing an electrophotographic printing-use developer
such as two-component toner and single-component toner
used in an electrophotographic apparatus, for example, a
copying machine.In order to obtain high-quality less foggy images
with high resolution, the electrophotographic printing-use
developer needs to improve the dispersion of components of
toner material such as a coloring agent, a charge control
agent, and of an offset preventing agent in a binding 
resin as a principal material of toner. The dispersion
depends largely on the viscosity of the mixture of the
above agents and the binding agent in fusing and kneading.Specifically, when the temperature of the toner
material rises due to the heat generated by shearing
forces in fusing and kneading, the viscosity is lowered
with a rise of the temperatures. Consequently, the toner
material fails to receive sufficient shearing forces, and
thereby resulting in unsatisfactory kneading.In order to overcome such a problem, for example,
Japanese Publication for Unexamined Patent Application No.
50624/1986 discloses a method for injecting a liquid into
the toner material in the fusing and kneading process.
Fig. 3(a) schematically illustrates an overall structure
of a machine for preparing an electrophotographic
printing-use developer. With the machine, a binding agent
and predetermined amounts of components of toner material
such as coloring, charge control and offset preventing
agents are introduced into a material mixer 21, and mixed
therein. The mixed toner material is supplied to a
material supply device 23 through a pipe 22 and then to a
kneader 25 through a pipe 24. In the kneader 25, the
toner material is fused and kneaded. The resulting toner
material is discharged onto a cooling conveyer 26 from the
kneader 25, and then coarsely crushed by a crusher 27. According to the method disclosed by the
above-mentioned publication, in the processes of preparing
the electrophotographic processing-use developer, fusing
and kneading are carried out while injecting a liquid into
the kneader 25 from a pump 29 through a spray nozzle 28.
More specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 3(b), components
of toner material 31 are sent through a mixing step 32 to
a kneading step 33 in which water 34 as a liquid is added,
and fusing and kneading are performed.In this case, the temperature of the toner material
is lowered since the added liquid component vaporizes by
taking the heat of vaporization from the toner material
and the
