<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed an imaging system forming a pseudoscopic image in focus throughout extended depth of field comprising an input relay lens array, a double integral microlens screen having a median plane on to which the input lens array images an object scene and, on the opposite side of the screen and the same distance therefrom as the input array, an output relay lens array similar to the input lens array.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to imaging systems. In WO 91/11745 an imaging system is disclosed which forms a 
pseudoscopic image comprising an input lens array, a double integral microlens screen 
and an output relay lens array. In such an arrangement, the effect of the microscreen 
texture impairs the quality of the image and that specification discloses an inexpensive 
way to reduce that effect, namely by spreading out the image from the input array which 
would ordinarily fall on the medium plane of the microlens screen, by means of a 
diffraction grating or like device, into a spectral streak. This spread-out image is 
reconstituted by a similar grating or other device at the output lens array. The 
integral screen is one which produces a so-called integral 
image giving depth resolution in any direction by integrating the image components from 
a plurality of directions. The present invention provides an arrangement which reduces vignetting 
and cross-talk between adjacent entrance and exit lenses of the relay arrays of WO 
91/11745 and which avoids the need for the use of the gratings or like devices. The invention comprises an imaging system for forming a pseudoscopic image 
of an object scene in focus throughout extended depth of field, comprising an input relay lens array, a 
double integral microlens screen having a median plane on to which plane the input lens 
array images the object scene and, on the opposite side of the screen and at the same  
 
distance therefrom as the input array, an output relay lens array similar to the input lens 
array, the double integral microlens screen comprising two similar contiguous microlens screens 
each comprising double convex microlenses each having a thickness equal to its focal 
length and being optically coupled so that each lens element of one of the two screens 
faces a corresponding lens element of the other. The relay lenses are substantially larger than the screen microlenses. An optical instrument comprising such an imaging system may have fixed 
components for dedicated use or may be adjustable, the input and output relay lens arrays 
being mounted and having means for equal and opposite adjustment with respect to the 
double integral microlens screen. One embodiment of an imaging system according to the invention will now 
be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:-

and images; Figure 2is an axial view of the input relay lens array of Figure 1; Figure 3is
