<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel vitamin D 
analogues, more particularly to 1α-hydroxy vitamin D₃ 
analogues having a modified side chain at the 17-position 
and exhibiting cell modulating activity. Vitamin D₃, which has the formula 
 
is well known to play a vital role in the metabolism of 
calcium, by promoting intestinal absorption of calcium 
and phosphorus, maintaining adequate serum levels of 
calcium and phosphorus and stimulating mobilisation of 
calcium from the bone fluid compartment in the presence 
of parathyroid hormone. About 20 years ago it was learned that the D 
vitamins undergo hydroxylation in vivo, hydroxylation at 
the 25-position occurring in the liver and hydroxylation 
at the 1α-position occurring in the kidney, the 
resulting 1α,25-dihydroxy metabolite being the 
biologically active material. This discovery led to the 
synthesis of many analogues of vitamin D, evaluation of 
which indicated that hydroxyl groups at the 1α-position 
and at either the 24R- or the 25-position were essential  
 
for a compound or metabolite thereof to exhibit a 
substantial effect on calcium metabolism. While, as 
indicated above, such hydroxyl groups will normally 
ultimately be introduced in vivo, hydroxylation at the 
24R- or 25-position occurring rather more readily than 
at the 1α-position, the use of vitamin D analogues 
already so hydroxylated has proved of substantial 
advantage by virtue of their enhanced levels of activity 
and their rapidity of action and subsequent elimination 
from the body. It will be appreciated that 1α-hydroxylated 
vitamin D derivatives are of especial 
benefit to patients suffering from renal failure. Examples of hydroxylated vitamin D analogues in 
current use include the natural metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxy 
vitamin D₃ and 1α-hydroxy vitamin D₃ (which is 
readily 25-hydroxylated in vivo). Other reportedly 
promising compounds include 1α,24R-dihydroxy vitamin D₃, 
D₂ analogues of the above compounds and 1α,25-dihydroxy 
analogues carrying fluorine atoms at the 24-, 26- and/or 
27- positions (see De Luca and Schnoes, Ann. Rev. 
Biochem. (1983), 52, pp 411-439 and De Luca et al., Top. 
Curr. Chem. (1979), 83, pp 1-65). More recently it has been learned that the natural 
metabolite 1α,25-dihydroxy vitamin D₃ has additional 
effects on cellular metabolism. These cell modulating 
effects include stimulation of cell maturation and 
differentiation (Tanaka et al., Biochem. J. (1982), 204, 
pp 713-719; Amento et al., J. Clin. Invest. (1984), 73, 
pp 731-739; Colston et al.,
