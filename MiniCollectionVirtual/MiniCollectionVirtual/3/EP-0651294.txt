toner free of metal such as chromium. A novel electrostatic 

image developing toner is provided, comprising as a charge-controlling 
agent one or more selected from the group 

consisting of compounds represented by formulae (I) and (II): 

wherein A and B each independently represent a hydrogen atom, 
a halogen atom, an alkoxyl group, a carboxyl group, a hydroxyl 

group, an ester group, a nitro group, an amino group, an 

alkylamino group, an alkyl group which may contain a 
substituent(s) or a phenyl group which may contain a 

substituent(s); R represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group 
which may contain a substituent(s), an alkyl group which may 

contain a substituent(s), a phenyl group which may contain a  
 

substituent(s) or a naphthyl group which may contain a 
substituent(s); m represents an integer of 2 to 16; and n 

represents an integer 4 to 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrostatic image
developing toner comprising a specific compound.In the electrophotographic image formation process, an
electrostatic latent image is formed on an inorganic
photoreceptor such as selenium, selenium alloy, cadmium sulfide
and amorphous silicon or an organic photoreceptor comprising a
charge-generating agent and a charge-transporting agent. The
electrostatic latent image thus formed is developed with a
toner, transferred to a paper or plastic film, and then fixed
to obtain a visible image.Photoreceptors can be charged positively or negatively
depending on their configuration. Photoreceptors which allow a
printed area to be left as an electrostatic latent image are
developed with an oppositely-chargeable toner while those which
allow a printed area to be destaticized to effect reversal
development are developed with a toner chargeable to the same
sign as the printed area.A toner comprises a binder resin, a colorant, and other
additives. In order to have desirable friction chargeability
(charging rate, charging level, charging stability, etc.), age
stability and environmental stability, the toner normally
comprises a charge-controlling agent incorporated therein. This 
charge-controlling agent has a great effect on the properties
of the toner.A color toner requires a charge-controlling agent
having a light-colored, preferably colorless charge-controlling
agent that has no effect on the hue of the image. Examples of
such a light-colored or colorless charge-controlling agent
employable in negatively-chargeable toners include metal
complex salts of hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives as disclosed
in JP-B-55-42752 (The term "JP-B" as used herein means an
"examined Japanese patent publication"), JP-A-61-69073, and JP-A-61-221756
(The term "JP-A" as used herein means an
"unexamined published Japanese patent application"), metallic
salts of aromatic dicarboxylic acids as disclosed in JP-A-57-111541,
metal complex salts of anthranilic acid derivatives as
disclosed in JP-A-61-141453, and JP-A-62-94856, organic boron
compounds as disclosed in U.S Patent 4,767,688, and JP-A-1-306861,
and biphenol compounds as disclosed in JP-A-61-3149.
Examples of such a charge-controlling agent for positively-chargeable
toners include quaternary ammonium salt compounds as
disclosed in JP-A-57-119364, JP-A-58-9154, and JP-A-58-98742.However, these charge-controlling agents have many
disadvantages. For example, some of these charge-controlling
agents are chromium compounds which are
