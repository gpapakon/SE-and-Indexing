<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus in which sheets on 
which image formation has been effected are once 

contained in an intermediate tray for second image 
formation and the sheets contained in the intermediate 

tray are re-fed to an image forming portion to thereby 
effect plural times of image formation on a sheet is 

characterized by counting means for counting the sheets 
contained in the intermediate tray.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image forming
apparatus provided with an intermediate tray, such as a
copying machine, a printer or a facsimile machine.Image forming apparatuses such as copying
machine, printers and facsimile machine include ones
which can effect both-surface image formation, i.e.,
forming images on the front and back surfaces of a
sheet material, and ones of the multiplex type which
effects image formation by superposing images on the
front surface of a sheet material.In an image forming apparatus shown in Figure 3
of the accompanying drawings, originals (not shown) are
successively set at a predetermined position on platen
glass 3 by the use of an automatic original feeding
device 2 provided on top of an image forming apparatus
body 1. One of the originals set on the platen glass
3 is scanned by an optical system 4 and is exposed onto
a photosensitive drum 5 rotating in a clockwise
direction. An electrostatic latent image formed on
the photosensitive drum 5 is developed into a toner
image by toner supplied from a developing device 6.Also, in this image forming apparatus, sheet 
materials S stacked on one of a plurality of sheet
supply portions (a sheet supply cassette and a sheet
supply deck) 7, 8, 9 are successively supplied to the
photosensitive drum 5. The toner image on the
photosensitive drum 5 is transferred onto the sheet
materials S supplied to the photosensitive drum 5, by a
transfer charger 10. The sheet materials S onto which
the toner image has been transferred are sent to a
fixating device 12 by a conveyor 11, and the fixation
of the toner image is effected by the fixating device 12.When the fixation of the toner image is terminated,
the copying on one surface of the sheet materials S is
terminated, but in the case of both-surface copying,
copying on the other surfaces of the sheet materials S
is effected subsequently and therefore, the sheet
materials S are not discharged out of the apparatus,
but are once stacked on an intermediate tray 13 in the
image forming apparatus body 1. That is, in the case
of both-surface copying, the sheet materials S on which
the toner image has been fixated by the fixating device
12 are directed to a reversing path 15 by a reversing
flapper 14 changed over to a position indicated by broken
line, and are conveyed in the direction of arrow a,
whereafter the sheets S are returned in the direction of
arrow b and are directed to an intermediate tray discharge
path 16, and are discharged onto the intermediate tray 13
by a pair of discharge rollers 17

<CLAIMS>
An image forming apparatus in which sheets on which
image formation has been effected are once contained in an

intermediate tray (55) for another image formation, and then
are re-fed to an image forming portion (34) to thereby effect

plural times of image formation on a sheet,

   characterized by

first counting means (65) for counting the sheets
contained in said intermediate tray,
second counting means for counting the number of sheets
on which another image formation has been effected, and
control means (70) for specifying, when an accident
occurs to the re-fed sheets and the re-fed sheets are

removed, the removed sheets on the basis of the count values
of said first and second counting means.
An image forming apparatus according to Claim 1,
wherein said counting means has a circulation path for

returning the sheets fed out of said intermediate tray back to said
intermediate tray, and a counter for counting the sheets

passing through said circulation path.
An image forming apparatus according to Claim 1,
wherein
 said control means controls so that the same images
as the images formed on the removed sheets before contained

in said intermediate tray may be formed on new sheets, and in
place of the removed sheets, said new sheets may be contained

in said intermediate tray. 
An image forming apparatus according to Claim 3,
wherein said control means adjusts its position so that in

place of the removed sheets, the new sheets contained in said
intermediate tray may be re-fed in the same order as the

order during the re-feeding of the removed sheets.
An image forming apparatus according to Claim 4,
further having image reading means for reading the image of

an original and wherein said image forming portion forms on
the sheets the image read by said image reading means.
An image forming apparatus according to Claim 5,
wherein the original is read at the image reading position of

said image forming means, and said apparatus has an original
feeding device for feeding the original to said image

reading position.
An image forming apparatus according to Claim 1,
wherein the sheets contained in said intermediate tray are

re-fed to the image forming portion, whereby image formation
is effected on both surfaces of a sheet.
