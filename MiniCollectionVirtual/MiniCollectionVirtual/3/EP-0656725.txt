<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image-shake
preventing device suitable for use in an image pickup
apparatus, such as a video camera, and capable of correcting
a shake (movement) of an image due to a vibration of the
apparatus, or the like.An electronic correcting system, an optical
correcting system and the like have heretofore been known as
a system for correcting a shake of an image in this kind of
image-shake preventing device. The electronic correcting
system is generally arranged to store in a memory an input
image which immediately precedes the current input image,
detect a shake of an image by detecting a variation of the
image from the current input image and the previous input
image stored in the memory, and vary an image reading
position in the memory from which to read out a cut-out image
so as to cancel the shake, thereby correcting the shake of
the image. The optical correcting system generally includes
a variable angle prism disposed in front of a lens and is
arranged to turn the variable angle prism and bend the
optical axis thereof so as to cancel a shake of an image,
thereby correcting the shake of the image.Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing the arrangement
of a video camera having an image-shake preventing device of
the conventional, electronic correction type. The 
arrangement shown in Fig. 1 includes an optical system 1 made
up of predetermined constituent components, such as a
focusing lens group provided for the purpose of focusing, a
zooming lens group for varying a focal length of the optical
system 1, a compensation lens group, and an iris for
adjusting the amount of light, an image pickup element 2 made
up of, for example, a two-dimensional CCD and provided for
converting an input light signal into an electrical signal
and outputting the electrical signal, a sample-and-hold (S/H)
circuit 3 for sampling and holding the electrical signal
supplied from the image pickup element 2, at intervals of a
predetermined period, and an automatic gain control (AGC)
circuit 4 for controlling the gain of the electrical signal
outputted from the S/H circuit 3.The arrangement shown in Fig. 1 also includes an
analog-to-digital (A/D) converter 5 for converting an analog
signal outputted from the AGC circuit 4 into a digital
signal, a Y/C separation circuit 6 for generating two kinds
of delayed signals, i.e., a 1H delayed signal (H: horizontal
synchronizing period) and a 2H delayed signal, from the
signal outputted from the A/D converter 5 and performing
computations on the 1H and 2H delayed
