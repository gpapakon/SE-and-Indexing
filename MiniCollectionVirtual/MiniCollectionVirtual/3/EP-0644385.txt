<ABSTRACT>
A refrigerator has a freezing compartment (100), a cold 
storage compartment (110), and a refrigerating circuit 

(104, 112, 120) for refrigerating and circulating air to 
keep the two compartments at the required temperatures. 

The efficiency of the refrigerating circuit, which includes 
an evaporator
 (104) to refrigerate the air, is enhanced by 
reducing the moisture content of the circulated air before 

it is returned to the evaporator. In this respect, the air 
exiting both the freezing compartment (100) and the cold 

storage compartment (110) is directed to a return air duct 
(200) connected to deliver air to the evaporator (104). A 

partition (400) extends along the air duct such that air 
from the two compartments flows along opposite sides 

thereof in heat exchange relationship. To reduce the 
moisture content of the air, the partition (400) is made of 

material with a high thermal conductivity and/or 
incorporates a heater (403).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for 
reducing frost in a refrigerator, and more particularly to 
a system which can reduce moisture to be frosted on the 
outside of an evaporator in a refrigerator and thereby can 
improve the refrigeration efficiency or the coefficient of 
performance of the refrigerator. As is well known, a refrigerator is a household 
appliance for freezing or storing goods such as food at a 
cold temperature and/or in frozen by means of refrigerant 
circulating in a refrigeration cycle. That is, after 
compressed in a compressor, the refrigerant is condensed 
and liquified in a condenser, and evaporated in an 
evaporator, and expanded in an expander such as an 
expansion valve, and then flows to the compressor again. In this process, the refrigerant absorbs heat from 
the surroundings in the course of evaporating in the 
evaporator so as to provide the refrigerator with a 
refrigerating force, and air circulates in a freezing room 
and/or a cold storage room after receiving the 
refrigerating force from the evaporator in the vicinity 
thereof, so that it freezes and/or cools the goods stored 
therein. FIG. 1 is a schematic side sectional view of a  
 
conventional refrigerator 1 showing the flow of cold air, 
which deliver the refrigerating force into the freezing 
room and/or the cold storage room, in the refrigerator. As 
shown, refrigerator 1 has a freezing room 2, an evaporator 
4 disposed at the rear of freezing room 2, and a return 
duct 5 disposed between freezing room 2 and cold storage 
room 3. The air cooled in the course of passing through 
evaporator 4 is supplied into freezing and cold storage 
rooms 2 and 3, and then the air is returned to evaporator 
4 after being warmed in the course of circulating in 
freezing and cold storage rooms 2 and 3. In this case, the warmed air after circulating in 
freezing room 2 and cold storage room 3 contains much 
moisture, and this moisture is rapidly frozen and frosted 
on evaporator 4 in the course of passing through 
evaporator 4. When the evaporator is frosted, the thermal 
conductivity of the evaporator decreases and thereby the 
refrigeration efficiency or the coefficient of performance 
of the refrigerator is largely reduced. Therefore, in 
order to prevent this reduction of the coefficient of 
performance, a heater 6 is disposed in the vicinity of the 
evaporator, and the frost frozen on the exterior of the 
evaporator is removed by stopping refrigerator and at the 
same time operating heater 6. However, in this
