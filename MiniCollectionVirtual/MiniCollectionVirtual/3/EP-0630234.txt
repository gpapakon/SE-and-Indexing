<ABSTRACT>
ACTH polymeric controlled release systems are described wherein the ACTH retains good biological activity and is released over an extended period of time following administration by injection. In the preferred embodiment, the ACTH polymeric microspheres are made using very cold temperatures to freeze the polymer-ACTH mixtures into polymeric microspheres with very high retention of biological activity and material. Sustained release of biologically active ACTH is achieved when the mircrospheres are tested in vitro, extending over a period of greater than one day to several months. Altered release can be achieved by inclusion of degradation modifiers, pore forming agents, and stabilizers of the ACTH.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to polymeric 
microspheres for controlled release of ACTH. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a 
polypeptide secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. 
The polypeptide contains 39 amino acids and has a 
molecular weight of about 4500 Daltons. ACTH is 
extracted from the pituitary of mammals, especially 
pigs, for clinical use. The activity of ACTH is 
defined by a USP assay in hypophysectomized rats. ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to synthesize 
and secrete adrenocortical hormones including 
cortisol, corticosterone, several weakly androgenic 
steroids, and, to a very limited extent, aldosterone. 
Under normal circumstances, endogenous release of ACTH 
is stimulated by corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) 
which is secreted by the hypothalamus. Exogenously 
administered ACTH produces all of the pharmacological 
effects usually produced by endogenous ACTH. ACTH is utilized for its anti-inflammatory and 
immunosuppressant properties. In particular, it has 
been used for the following indications: 1) acute 
exacerbations of Multiple Sclerosis, 2) acute 
exacerbations of rheumatic disorders such as 
Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriatic Arthritis, 3) acute 
episodes of Ulcerative Colitis, 4) Infantile spasms 
and 5) acute bouts of Systemic Lupus Erythematous. 
Currently, for clinical purposes, ACTH is available as 
Corticotropin™ for injection, repository 
Corticotropin™ injection (containing partially 
hydrolyzed gelatin) and Corticotropin™ zinc hydroxide 
suspension. Corticotropin injection is rapidly absorbed 
following IM or SQ injection, whereas after injection 
of corticotropin zinc hydroxide suspension or 
repository corticotropin injection, the drug is  
 
absorbed over a period of 4-10 hours, and plasma 
levels return to baseline after 24 hours. ACTH is generally administered once or twice a 
day for up to 7-21 days, necessitating frequent IV or 
IM or SQ injections. The advantages of a controlled 
release formulation for ACTH include increased patient 
compliance and acceptance by reducing the number of 
injections, increased therapeutic benefit by 
eliminating the peak and valley changes in blood 
levels, and potentially lowering the total 
administered amount of drug by reducing peaks and 
valleys. One means for controlling blood levels of a 
compound is to administer it in the form of a 
polymeric matrix that releases compound as a function 
of polymer degradation and/or drug diffusion. A 
variety of biodegradable and non-biodegradable 
polymers have been
