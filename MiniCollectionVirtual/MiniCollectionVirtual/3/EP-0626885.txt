<ABSTRACT>
This invention is a catalyst comprising cerium bromide on a baddeleyite phase zirconia support and a process using that catalyst to form elemental bromine. The figure shows an embodiment of the inventive process wherein HBr and oxygen are mixed to form a reactor feedstream (214) which is then introduced into reactor (216) that contains the catalyst. The reaction product stream (218) is cooled and separated to produce the desired Br2 product stream (258).

<DESCRIPTION>
 CeBr3 CATALYST AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING BROMINEField of the InventionThis invention is a catalyst and a process using that catalyst for oxidizing hydrogen bromide to form elemental bromine. The inventive catalyst composition comprises cerium bromide on certain zirconia containing supports. The zirconia support, preferably largely in the baddeleyite phase, stabilizes the cerium bromide catalyst against cerium oxide formation at operating temperatures and gives the catalyst excellent activity at lower temperatures.Background of the Invention This invention is both a catalyst and a process for producing elemental bromine from hydrogen bromide using that catalyst.Bromine is a chemical feedstock often used for the production of bromoalkanes or olefins from alkanes. Bromine is found in nature only as dilute sources such as seawater or as brine well deposits. The classic process for producing bromine from such sources involves a multistage process involving electrolyzing, chlorinating, or acidifying the brine to release elemental bromine or hydrogen bromide into a solution, aerating or steaming the resulting dilute solution, absorbing the bromine or hydrogen bromide from the aeration effluent, and distilling the resulting adsorbate to recover the bromine. 

 It is, for course, desirable not to be placed in the position of requiring fresh bromine if another suitable bromine-containing source is available from which to produce elemental bromine. Hydrobromic acid or hydrogen bromide (HBr) is a byproduct of a wide variety of chemical processes. This invention is a process utilizing a hydrogen bromide feed in producing elemental bromine.There are a number of processes described in the open literature which produce bromine according to the equation:4 HBr + 02 > 2Br2 + 2 H20.One such process (British Patent 930,341) involves the conversion of hydrobromic acid solutions using dissolved metal ion catalysts. The soluble metal may be gold, cerium, chromium, nickel, platinum, thorium, titanium, or vanadium; but preferably is iron or copper. A gas containing oxygen is passed through the acidic solution containing HBr and the dissolved metal, all at a temperature below the boiling point of the liquid. The gaseous effluent is then separated via condensation and distillation into product bromine, water, and HBr for recycle to the oxidation step.Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 3,179,498, to Harding et al . , discloses a process in which a nitrite catalyst is employed in an acidic, aqueous solution of HBr to effect the oxidation of
