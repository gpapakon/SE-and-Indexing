<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a building for accommodating 
livestock with a roof (1) having two roof parts (3,4) extending 

obliquely downward from a ridge, wherein transparent plate 
material (7) extends parallel to the ridge, the ends edges (8) of 

which plate material close to the ridge form between them a 
ventilation slot. At a distance above the ventilation slot a 

roof cap (21) is arranged with a width greater than that of the 
ventilation slot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a barn for
accommodating livestock, comprising a roof having two
roof parts extending obliquely downward from a ridge, the
roof comprising longitudinal beams
which extend at a distance parallel to said ridge and are
covered by plate
material, where the end edges of the plate material close
to the ridge form between them a ventilation slot and
wherein at a distance above the ventilation slot a roof
cap is arranged with a width greater than that of the
ventilation slot.Such a barn is known from the German
Offenlegungsschrift 2,910,447, where adjacent the
ventilation slot plate material is positioned, which is
opaque. Also beams are arranged in adjoinment with the
slot, while all parts of an installation controlling
movement of the roof cap to and from the ventilation slot
are arranged in the ventilation slot. The known barn has
for a disadvantage, that lighting inside the barn is
dismal. As a result additional lighting is required,
which is detrimental in that large quantities of energies
are required. Furthermore the livestock in the barn is
usually ill at ease in artificial lighting, whereas this
livestock resides in the barn for the better part of
winter, which is detrimental to the health and well being
of the livestock.The present invention is directed at improving
conditions inside the barn and lowering energy
consumption by providing a barn characterised in that said plate
material extending parallel to and towards the ridge is transparent,
and the roof between said longitudinal beams 
is free of bearing parts extending parallel thereto.
According to the present invention a very good ventilation
is hereby obtained, while light is moreover
allowed through a relatively large area, whereby the
lighting inside the building is favourable for the
livestock, at least during the day time, while energy
consumption is lowered. According to a further favourable development the step
of claim 2 is applied. The standing edges prevent sudden
blasts of wind inside the ventilation slot. The wind blows
over the roof cap so that ventilation is intensified as a
result of a venturi effect.Through application of the step of claim 3 the total
light-transmitting area is further enlarged, which brings
about a pleasant lighting inside the building or shed.The step of claim 4 herein provides a good wind
guiding, which enhances the ventilation.Depending on the local conditions and for instance the
time of year, it may be desired to increase or reduce the
ventilation options. The step of claim

<CLAIMS>
Barn for accommodating livestock, comprising
a roof (1) having two roof parts (3, 4) extending

obliquely downward from a ridge, the roof (1) comprising
longitudinal beams (5, 6)

which extend at a distance parallel to said ridge and are
covered by plate material (7),

where the end edges of the plate material (7) close to
the ridge form between them a ventilation slot and

wherein at a distance above the ventilation slot a roof
cap (21, 28, 33, 37) is arranged with a width greater

than that of the ventilation slot,
characterised in that
said plate material (7) extending parallel to and towards the ridge
is transparent,

and the roof (1)
between said longitudinal beams (5, 6) is free of

bearing parts extending parallel thereto.
Barn as claimed in claim 1, wherein the end
edges of the plate material are standing end edges.
Barn as claimed in any of the foregoing claims,
wherein the roof cap is of transparent plate material.
Barn as claimed in any of the foregoing claims,
wherein the roof cap has a reverse V-shaped section with an

apex angle substantially equal to the angle between the roof
parts.
Barn as claimed in any of the foregoing claims,
wherein the roof cap is mounted height-adjustably.
Barn as claimed in claim 5, comprising remotely
controllable drive means for height adjustment of the roof

cap.
Barn as claimed in any of the foregoing claims,
wherein transverse supports on which the roof cap is mounted

extend at regular intervals between the longitudinal beams.
Barn as claimed in claim 7, wherein each
transverse support comprises two parallel reverse V-shaped

elements having mounting elements protruding therebetween at 
the ends for fixing to the cross beams and a support for the

roof cap protruding therebetween close to the middle,
wherein the mounting elements and the support can be clamped

fixedly in different positions between the V-shaped
elements.
