<ABSTRACT>
In order to improve the ease of operation and the outcome of the work of a device (1) for deforming thin-walled components (12), in particular for repairing damage to car body parts (12), having a holding member (7) that can be welded to the component (12) to be deformed and having a pulling device (4) for applying tensile forces to the holding member (7), and to make the said device (1) more universal in application, the pulling device (4) can be actuated by motor and a part of the component (12) to be deformed can be brought into a predeterminable end position by means of the pulling device (4), by motor actuation, after the holding member (7) has been welded on.

A device (1) for shaping thin-walled components
(12) for repairing damage to car body parts (12),

comprising a retaining element (7) disposed on one end
of a pull rod (21) and weldable to the component (12)

for shaping, and a pulling device (4) for applying
pulling forces to the retaining element (7), the

pulling device (4) being adapted to be kinetically
actuated and a part of the component (12) for shaping

being adapted to be brought into a presettable end
position by the kinetic actuation of the pulling device

(4) after the retaining element (7) has been welded on,
characterised by an adjustable depth abutment (6)

disposed at the other end of the pull rod (21), whereby
the zero level of the original body parts or a defined

overshoot for allowing for the depth to which the
damaged part has to be pulled can be set for each

operation, in order to reach a defined end position of
the pulling device (4).
A device according to claim 1, characterised by a
means (13) for supplying cooling agent, particularly

air, to the heated re-shaped part of the component
(12).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
by a kinetically actuated means (5) for releasing the

welded-on retaining element (7).
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised by a single manually-actuated operating

element (8) for the functional sequences of welding on, 
pulling, cooling, turning off and/or return to the

starting position.
A device according to claim 4, characterised in
that the manually actuated operating element (8)

comprises actuating positions (SO, S1, S2+3, S4)
associated with the individual functional sequences.
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
more particularly according to claim 4 or 5,

characterised by a pneumatic control sub-assembly (9)
which is disposed in a handle part (2) of the device

(1) and effects pneumatic control operations via the
axial position of a single pneumatic control means

(37).
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised by a means (14) which when the pulling

device (4) reaches the end position supplies cooling
air and/or releases the retaining element (7) from the

component (12).
A device according to claim 7, characterised in
that the means (14) comprises at least one relief valve

(34, 52) which when the pressure rises in the end
position of the pulling device (4) opens and releases

cooling air and/or releases the retaining element from
the component (12).
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that after the welding on operation,

the retaining element (4) is pulled smoothly, more
particularly by means of a restrictor disposed in a

pneumatic feed line (24) to the pulling device (4). 
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that an electric and/or pneumatic

control device (9) automates the functional sequences
of welding on, pulling, cooling, turning off and/or

return to the starting position.
A device according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that during pulling the pulling device

(4) is braced against the component (12) by one or more
insertable foot parts (26) of selectable contact shape.
A system for machining thin-walled components,
more particularly for repairing damage to car bodies

(12), comprising a device according to any of claims 1
to 11 and a supply unit (47) for electric welding of

the retaining element (7) to the component (12).
A system according to claim 12, characterised in
that the supply unit (47) supplies an adjustable amount

of heat for a presettable time, resulting in adjustable
heating during and/or after the welding on of the

retaining element (7).
