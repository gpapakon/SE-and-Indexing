<ABSTRACT>
In order that the tank 2 of a sewage treatment work can be subdivided as required, an apparatus 1 is proposed which is composed of a canvas 3 which can be tightened in the manner of a drum skin in at least one direction and of elements (4', 4'', 7', 7'') engaging at the edge (3', 3'', 3''') of the canvas (3) and the edges (3', 3'', 3''') of the canvas (3) are created having means for the introduction of force, for example beam pockets (3.1', 3.1'') and pole pockets (3.2) and, as required, have sealing flaps (3.6).

<CLAIMS>
A device comprising a sewage treatment tank and a dividing
wall which subdivides the sewage treatment tank into two

chambers, characterized in that the dividing wall comprises at
least one planar tarpaulin (3), tensioned in the manner of a

drumhead, and means acting on the edge of the tarpaulin (3),
and in that at least some edges of the tarpaulin have sealing

tabs (3.6).
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
edge (3', 3'') of the tarpaulin (3) is provided with bar pockets

(3.1', 3.1'') and the edge (3'' ') of the tarpaulin (3) is
provided with a pole pocket (3.2).
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
bar pockets (3.1' , 3.1'') serve to receive the bars (4' ,4'') and

the pole pocket (3.2) serves to receive a pole (7), and in that
the bar pockets (3.1', 3.1'') and pole pockets (3.2) for

attaching the tensioning means (10), cutouts are provided.
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
edges of the sealing tabs (3.6) are equipped with eyes (3.5)

through which a tying means may be threaded.
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
tarpaulin (3) is subdivided at least once and has at least one

casing seam (3.3) and a support (6) in the casing seam (3.3).
A device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that 
the bar (4') is supported at its ends, and tensioning means

(10) and tensioning tie rods (11) fasten the bar (4'') to the
tank bottom (2') and the pole (7) to the tank wall (2'').
A device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
the edges (3', 3'', 3'' ') of the tarpaulin (3) are provided with

a bolt rope connection (3.4), and the bars (4), the support (6)
and the pole (7) are provided with grooves for receiving the

bolt rope connection (3.4).
A device according to Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that
the edges (3', 3'', 3'' ') of the tarpaulin (3) can be tensioned

by means of eyes (3.5) through which a tying means may be
threaded.
A device according to Claims 1 to 8, characterized in
that, to tension the tarpaulin (3), pulleys and lifting blocks

are used as the tensioning means (10).
