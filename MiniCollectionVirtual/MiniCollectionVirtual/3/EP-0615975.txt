<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of chemical compounds and 
physiologically acceptable salts thereof for the therapheutic and 
prophylactic control and treatment of the Acquired Immuno Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS), infections by Human Immunodeficiency Virus, hepatitis B 
virus infections and retrovirus infections and method for such control 
and treatment in animal and man. In the late seventies a new disease was reported, which subsequently was 
referred to as Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). It is now 
generally accepted that a retrovirus referred to as HIV (Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus), formerly known as Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus 
(HTLV-III) or Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus (LAV) plays an essential 
role in the etiology of AIDS. AIDS is characterized by a profound immunodeficiency due to low numbers 
of a subset of lymphocyte-T-helper cells, which are one target for HIV 
infection. The profound immunodeficiency in AIDS patients makes these 
patients highly susceptible to a variety of opportunistic infections of 
bacterial, fungal, protozoal or viral etiology. The etiological agents 
among viral opportunistic infections are often found in the herpes virus 
group, i.e., Herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella Zoster virus (VZV), 
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and, especially, cytomegalovirus (CMV). Other 
retroviruses affecting humans are HTLV-I and II and examples of retroviruses 
affecting animals are feline leukemia virus and equine infectios 
anaemia virus. Hepatitis B virus infections cause severe disease such as acute hepatitis, 
chronic hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis in a considerable number 
of persons. It is estimated that there are 200 million patients with 
chronic hepatitis B infection in the world. A considerable number of the  
 
chronic cases progress to liver cirrosis and liver tumours. In some 
cases the hepatitis infections also take a rapid and severe course as in 
fulminant B hepatitis with about 90 % mortality. At present there is no 
known effective treatment against hepatitis B infections. A great number of nucleoside analogues exhibit several antimetabolic 
activities. They do so by substituting for or competing with the naturally 
occuring nucleosides. Recently some nucleoside analogues have been 
described, which inhibit in cell culture the multiplication of human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV, also called HTLV-III, LAV), the causative 
agent of AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC). Such compounds are for 
example azidothymidine, dideoxycytidine and

salts thereof, for use in therapy. 
A pharmaceutical composition comprising as active ingredient a 
compound of claim 1 or 2 or therapeutically acceptable salts thereof. 
Use of a compound according to claim 1 or 2, and of therapeutically 
acceptable salts thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament 

for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of infections caused by 
a retrovirvs, such as HIV, or by hepatitis B virus (HBV).

against infection in man caused by HIV. 
The use according to claim 5, wherein said therapeutic treatment is 
against infection in man caused by HBV. 
A process for the preparation of a compound according to claim 1 
to 2 or of a therapeutically acceptable salt thereof, selected from 

the group: 

A. Condensing a glycoside as comprised in the formula of claim 1 to 
the N-1 position of a uracil derivative corresponding to radical A in 

claim 1, whereafter the α-anomer of the compound thus formed is 
separated and any protecting groups removed; 
B. Anomerization of a β-anomer of the formula 
 

wherein R' is a hydroxy-protecting group, to a mixture of α-and β-anomers, 
whereafter the α-anomer is separated and any protecting 

groups removed; 
C. Transglycosylation of a nucleoside of the formula 
 

wherein R' is defined as above and wherein B is a pyrimidine or 
purine base, under formation of a nucleoside containing a uracil 

radical as A, whereafter the α-anomer is separated and any protecting 
groups removed; 
D. Substitution of the radical R'' in a compound of the formula 
 

wherein A and R' are as defined above and wherein R'' is a leaving 
group, with the radical -F as R, whereafter any protecting 

groups are removed.
