<CLAIMS>
Flexible circuit for the connection of a printed circuit, 
comprising a flexible support (3; 103) with at least one 

connecting conductor (4; 104) provided with an end conducting 
area (8; 108) for connection to a connecting pin (5; 105), 

means (8 ; 108 ; 118) for receiving Leans (5;105;115) for making 
a portion (13; 113) of the flexible support (3; 103) rigid, the 

portion (9) of the conductor adjacent to the end area (8; 
108) extending over said portion (13; 113) of the flexible 

support (3; 103), characterised by the fact that the receiving 
means (8; 108; 118) are arranged to receive a rigidification pin 

(5; 105; 115). 
Circuit according to Claim 1, in which, the connecting pin 
(5) being a pin for making said portion (13) of the flexible 

support (3) rigid, the conductor (4) extends as far as the area 
(8) for the connection and reception of the pin (5) by at least 

one bent portion of conductor (14). 
Circuit according to one of Claims 1 and 2, in which the 
portion (14) of the conductor (4) adjacent to the connecting area 

(8) is bent back on itself. 
Circuit according to Claim 1, in which a rigidification 
pin (115) received in an isolated area (118) is provided. 
Circuit according to one of Claims 1 and 4, in which the 
portion (124) of the conductor (104) adjacent to the connecting 

area (108) is rectilinear.
