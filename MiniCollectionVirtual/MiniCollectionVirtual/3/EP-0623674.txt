<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to cytokine receptors, 
and more specifically, to Interleukin-1 receptors. Interleukin-1α and Interleukin-1β (IL-1α and IL-1β) are 
distantly related polypeptide hormones which play a central role in the 
regulation of immune and inflammatory responses. These two proteins 
were originally both classified as IL-1, based on a shared lymphocyte 
activation factor (LAF) activity, and a common major cellular source, 
activated macrophages. As information has accumulated from studies 
using purified natural and recombinant IL-1 molecules, it has become 
clear that IL-1α and IL-1β each mediate most, if not all, of the wide 
range of activities previously ascribed to IL-1. The basis for this 
nearly identical spectrum of biological activities is thought to be a 
single class of plasma membrane IL-1 receptors which bind both IL-1α and 
IL-1β. A few preliminary reports concerning the existence of an IL-1 
plasma membrane receptor have been published. To date, structural 
characterization of the Interleukin-1 receptor has been limited to 
estimates of the molecular weight of this protein by gel filtration, by 
SDS-PAGE analysis of covalent complexes formed by chemical crosslinking 
between the receptor and ¹²⁵I-IL-1 molecules, and by immunoprecipitation 
of labeled surface proteins. Dower et al. (J. Exp. Med.162:501, 1985), and Dower et al. 
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA83:1060, 1986), describe chemical 
crosslinking studies indicating an apparent 79.5 kilodalton (kDa) plasma 
membrane protein on LBRM-33-1A5 murine T lymphoma cells and a 78 kDa 
surface protein on a murine fibroblast cell line which bound 
¹²⁵I-labeled human Interleukin-1β. Kilian et al. (J. Immunol.136:4509, 
1986) reported that murine ¹²⁵I-IL-1α binding to murine thymoma cells 
could be blocked by human IL-1α and IL-1β. Dover et al. (Nature324:266, 
1986) reported binding competition studies indicating that 
IL-1α and IL-1β bound to the same cell surface receptors on LBRM-33-1A5 
cells, human dermal fibroblasts, murine BALB-3T3 cells, and ARH77, a  
 
human B lymphoblastoid cell line. The receptors in the different cell 
lineages exhibited similar but not identical binding characteristics. The IL-1 receptors on porcine synovial fibroblasts (Bird et 
al., Nature324:263, 1986) and human dermal fibroblasts (Chin et al., J. 
Exp. Med.165:70, 1987) have been shown to yield a major species in the 
size range Mr 97,000-100,000 when crosslinked to labeled IL-1, 
suggesting that a protein of Mr 80,000 was responsible
