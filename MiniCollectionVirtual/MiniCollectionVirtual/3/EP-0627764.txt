Process for the separation of chips from a
wafer,


in which an SOI substrate, comprising a substrate (1),
an insulation layer (2) and a silicon layer (3), is

used as the wafer,
in which the chips (3) are fabricated in the silicon
layer of this SOI substrate,
in which trenches (7) reaching down to the insulation
layer (2) of the SOI substrate are etched between the

chips (3), the etched trenches (7) are filled with
filling material (8), the wafer is then thinned, from

the side opposite to the chips, at least as far as
towards the insulation layer (2), and the insulation

layer and the said filling material (8) are then
removed,

characterized
in that the trenches (7) are filled with the same
material as the insulation layer (2) as filling

material, in that the insulation layer (2) is removed
by selective etching, and in that the filling material

is likewise removed by etching, so that the chips are
separated.
Process according to Claim 1,

in which the free surfaces of the chips, after the
etching of the trenches (7), are covered with a

passivation layer (5), with respect to which the
material of the insulation layer (2) can be etched 

selectively, the trenches (7) not being filled with the
passivation layer (5).
