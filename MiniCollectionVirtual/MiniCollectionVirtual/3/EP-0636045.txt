<ABSTRACT>
A sporting device steerable by weight displacement, for example in the form of a roller skate or roller ski comprises at least first and second wheels (10A, 10B) mounted on bearings for rotation about respective axles (46), said axles being mounted on said device, for example on a chassis (52) of said device, and spaced apart in the longitudinal direction of said device, with at least one of the wheels being steerable on displacement of the user's weight about an inclined steering axis (44) which intersects the ground substantially at the center (64A, 64B) of the contact patch of the respective wheel with the ground. The inclined steerable axis (44) extends downwardly and rearwardly for a front wheel (10A) and downwardly and forwardly for a rear wheel (10B). The steering axis is defined by a generally arcuate guide track (40; 42; 38; 87) provided within said inner race means (25). Said guide track has a center of curvature defining a virtual axis (44) forming said steering axis and disposed either inside or outside of said inner race means (25). The associated axle (40) has means (72, 74; 45, 47; 86) cooperating with said arcuate guide track to permit pivotal steering movement of said wheel (10) by relative movement between said guide track and said axle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sporting device 
steerable by weight displacement as defined in the 
preamble of claim 1 and to a steerable wheel assembly 
suitable for use in such a sporting device as defined 
in the preamble of claim 8. A sporting device and a steerable wheel element of this 
kind is known from international application 
PCT/EP89/00896 published under the number WO 90/01359. The aforementioned application describes a variety of 
different chassis designs having either two, three or 
more wheels which are generally arranged in-line in the 
longitudinal direction of the sporting device. With a 
two wheel arrangement only only one wheel needs to be 
steerable. In the case of a rear wheel the steering 
axis is inclined downwardly and forwardly and extends 
(when projected) through the contact patch of said 
wheel with the ground. In the case of a front wheel the 
steering axis is inclined downwardly and rearwardly 
through the contact patch of the wheel with the ground. 
With a three wheel device the center wheel would 
typically be fixed or, according to a proposal made for 
the first time herein, positioned with the steering 
axis disposed in a generally horizontal plane above or 
below the axis of rotation of the center wheel. The  
 
center wheel would be typically arranged between 
steerable front and rear wheels. Through this 
arrangement the center wheel can be constructed 
identically to the steerable front and rear wheels, but 
is however placed in such a way that movement of the 
center wheel about the steering axis does not primarily 
result in steering but simply assists in improving the 
handling characteristics of the sporting device. It is also possible for the center wheel to be mounted 
so that it can slide in a generally horizontal 
direction generally perpendicular to the fore and aft 
longitudinal direction of the roller skate, preferably 
against a resilient restoring force tending to align 
the center wheel in the fore and aft direction of the 
roller skate. Such a resilient restoring force could 
for example be generated by resilient cushions of 
rubber or synthetic rubber placed on one or both sides 
of the wheel or by some other spring means of 
equivalent effect. It should be noted that it is also 
possible to provide more than three wheels, e.g. four 
or five wheels, in which case all "center wheels", i.e. 
wheels other than the front and rear wheels can be 
executed as described immediately above with the 
possibility of horizontal sliding transverse to the
