<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a tubular bag which serves as packaging means, can be made continuously, especially on a tubular bag machine, and subsequently filled, and is intended for use without outer packaging. To be able to retain a high dimensional stability in unfavourable circumstances too, the tubular bag (1) which is of angular cross-section, is provided in these angles with edge reinforcements (17), such that no deformation of its side walls and edges occurs. The reinforcements consist in simple fashion of sealed seams which are produced by means of heat sealing in such a way that they do not have to fulfil any leaktightness-rendering function whatsoever.

<CLAIMS>
A device for manufacturing stand-up skin-type bags having 
a forming shoulder for forming a planar foil web into a sheathing 

material skin, a filling tube surrounded by the sheathing 
material skin, spreading elements for spreading the foil skin, 

and sealing tools for sealing the longitudinal sealing seam, the 
transverse sealing seam and the spread edges of a skin-type bag, 

characterized in that the cross-section of the filling tube (22) 
is matched to the cross-section of the skin-type bag (1) and is 

somewhat smaller than the latter, in that the filling tube has 
longitudinal edges (221), and spreading elements (222) directed 

radially away from the longitudinal edges (22) are secured to all 
the longitudinal edges of the filling tube (22) such that in the 

vicinity thereof the side walls (12) of the skin-type bag (1) are 
curved outwards, out of their plane, and in that the spreading 

elements (222) end far enough from the longitudinal edges (221) 
of the filling tube (22) for the side walls (12) to run through 

the sealing tools (23) in their edge region. 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that there 
serve as the spreading elements (222a) short profiled sheets 

which are provided with a profiled tip (223) which upstream of 
the sealing tools (23) as seen in the direction of transport of 

the sheathing material skin (10) project into the sealing region 
to such an extent that the edges (16) of the skin-type bag (1) 

do not themselves reach into the sealing tools (23). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that there 
serve as the spreading elements (222b) short profiled sheets 

which are provided with a profiled tip (223) which downstream of 
the sealing tools (23) as seen in the direction of transport of 

the sheathing material skin (10) project almost as far as the 
sealing seams.  

 
A device according to Claim 1, Claim 2 or Claim 3, 
characterized in that each edge (16) has a sealing tool (23) 

associated therewith. 
A device according to Claim 4, characterized in that 
continuously operating sealing tools (23) and a continuously 

operating foil draw-off means are provided. 
A device according to Claim 5, characterized in that sealing 
strips or rolls are provided as the sealing tools (23). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that a means 
of applying reinforcing portions to the foil web is provided and 

is positioned upstream of the region further down for the edges 
(16) to be reinforced.
