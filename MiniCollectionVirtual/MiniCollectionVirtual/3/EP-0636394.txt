<ABSTRACT>
A bowling alley comprising a leveled playing surface 
(1,2) covered with a low-friction carpet (4) and two pairs of 

opposing resilient raised rims (5) provided with pockets (13) 
at the joining corners thereof and at intermediate positions 

of the two longer rims (5). 
Each of the raised rims comprises a length of an 
elongated member incorporating means (2a, 2b, 2c) for securing 

the member to the playing surface and provided with a 
resilient profiled band (6) of elastomeric material. 
A protection arcuated metal strap (8) is inwardly 
secured to the raised rims (5) for preventing the bowls (7) 

from escaping out of the bowling alley.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improved bowling 
alley. As it is known billiard game is played on a small size 
table delimited by resilient raised sides or rims, where the 
players, standing outside the playing surface, strike the 
balls using a cue or hands according to different rules of 
games. For many reasons connected to the precision 
requirements this has been usually considered as an indoor 
game. On the other hand bowls games have been played since long 
and because of the playing field size it is an outdoor game 
also requiring some physical effort, and the players shoot 
their throws standing over the playing surface. The object of the present invention is to provide a new 
playing structure for playing a number of games that 
share features of the above mentioned games, i.e. billiard and 
bowls. Document US-A-1 946 232 teaches of a game apparatus for outdoor 
recreation upon which may be played on a larger scale a ball game 
in simulation of the game of billiards 
The apparatus disclosed by US-A-1 946 232 comprises a rectangular 
court, equipped with a fabric covering and provided with traps or 
pockets, delimited by rails equipped with a rubber strip. 
Another outdoor game apparatus presenting a playing field 
simulating a billiard table is disclosed in US-A1 95âŠ˜ 221. 
In the apparatus disclosed therein the field delimiting rails are 
equipped with resilient strips of rubber for rebound of the 
balls.  
 The invention refers to a quite large size structure 
resembling in part that of a billiard table but which is 
comparable with a bowling alley or lane, realized with proper 
materials and techniques, where a player throws the balls or 
the bowls standing upon the playing lane, using balls about as  
 
large as conventional bowls, but with the opportunity of 
playing with an improved accuracy and of taking advantage of 
the ball bouncing or rebounding as it happens in billiard 
games, using for example the rules of the billiard games in 
which the balls are hand-thrown. The above object is accomplished by a bowling alley as 
claimed in claim 1. Additional advantageous features are recited in the 
dependent claims. The invention will now be described in details with 
reference to the accompanying drawings, that illustrate a 
preferred but non limiting example thereof, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a plane view of the bowling alley according to 
the invention; Fig. 2 is a side view of the bowling alley according to 
the invention; Fig. 3 is scrap cross section view showing the 
construction of

<CLAIMS>
A rectangular bowling alley comprising 
a level playing surface (1,2) covered with a low-friction 

carpet (4) stuck thereto, and two pairs of opposing 
resilient raised rims (5) provided with pockets (13) at the 

joining corners thereof and at an intermediate position of the 
two longer rims (5) 

, characterized in that an arcuate metal strip (8) is 
fixed to the upper face of said rims (5), thereby preventing the 

bowls (7) from escaping from the playing field in the case in which they 
hit the rims at high speed. 
A bowling alley as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that each of said raised rims 

is provided with screw locking devices (2a,2b,2c) for securing 
the rims to the playing surface. 
A bowling alley as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that a 
profile (6) of elastomeric material is fitted to the inwardly 

facing side of the rims (5) along their whole length for allowing 
the bouncing of the bowls (7) at an angle equal to the incident 

one. 
A bowling alley as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that lamps (10) are secured to the undersurface of said 

protection arcuated strips (8). 
A bowling alley as claimed in claim 3 or 4, 
characterized in that the free edge of said protection strip 

(8) is covered by a rounded profile (11).  
 
A bowling alley as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that said 

profile (6) is secured to the rims (5) by means of complementary 
half-dovetail indented shapes. 
A bowling alley as claimed in claim 3, characterized 
in that said elastomeric material is natural or synthetic 

rubber. 
A bowling alley as claimed in the preceding claims, 
characterized in that said playing surface comprises a 

concrete bed (1) and a plurality of adjacent prefabricated 
panels (2) overlaying said concrete bed, each provided with 

devices (3, 3a, 3b) for leveling the playing surface. 
A bowling alley as claimed in the preceding claims, 
characterized in that channels (16) are located along the rims 

(5) for returning the bowls (7). 
A bowling alley as claimed in the preceding claims,
