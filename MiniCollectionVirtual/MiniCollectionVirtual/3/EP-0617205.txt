<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a nail (1) with an expansion region (3) which has a groove (6) which tapers towards the nail tip (4) and is delimited laterally by projecting walls (7, 8) on the shank (2). In conjunction with the walls (7, 8), the groove (6) forms the expansion region (3) of the nail (1). Into the groove (6) there may be introduced plastic which juts out of the groove (6) in the form of an elevation. By virtue of a groove base (9) which rises towards the nail tip (4), compaction of the plastic, and thus particularly secure fastening, is achieved.

<CLAIMS>
Nail having an expansion region which increases the holding force, the expansion
region being formed by side portions which project laterally from the nail shank,

between which side portions there is a cavity open to the outside, characterized in that
the cavity is in the form of a groove (6), which becomes narrower towards the nail

tip (4) and which is bounded laterally by the side portions (7, 8) and the base (9) of
which rises towards the nail tip (4) to the outer surface (10) of the shank (2).
Nail according to claim 1, characterized in that, starting from a widening of the shank
remote from the nail tip (4), the side portions (7, 8) extend towards the nail tip (4) at an

acute angle.
Nail according to one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in that the groove (6) is filled
with plastics material (14), which on the open side of the groove (6) projects above the

shank (2) of the nail (1) in the form of a protuberance (16), which tapers off towards
the nail tip (4).
Nail according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the shank (2),
including the expansion region (3), is coated with plastics material (14), and the

plastics sheathing (17) thereby formed has an annular notch (18) or a wide annular
groove (19) between the nail head (5) and the expansion region (3), and the plastics

sheathing (17) located between the annular notch (18) or annular groove (19) and the
nail tip (4) is at least slightly displaceable towards the nail tip (4).
Nail according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that, at the end of the
expansion region (3) nearest the nail head (5), the groove (6) is bounded by a

wall (11), which is essentially perpendicular to the outer surface (10) of the shank (2). 
Nail according to one of the preceding claims, characterized in that a centring
notch (13) is 
impressed in the nail head (5) concentrically with the central axis (12) of
the shank (2).
