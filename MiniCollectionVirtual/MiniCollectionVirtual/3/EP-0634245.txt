<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are iron based, austenitic alloys of 
substantially reduced cobalt content compared to well known 

cobalt base alloys, such as Stellite 1 and 6. They are less 
expensive than said cobalt based 

alloys, they are machinable using standard machine 
processes and procedures, and can be deposited as a hard 

surface with a tight crack pattern or a smooth surface, 
which does not stress crack upon cooling. 

The alloys contain the following elements:
 

   0.02 to  0.80% carbon
 

   2.00 to  3.00% silicon
 

   0.50 to  3.00% manganese
 

  20.00 to 30.00% chromium
 

   7.00 to  9.00% nickel
 

   5.00 to  9.00% molyodenum, with the proviso that the sum of the 
contents of carbon, silicon, manganese, chromium, nickel and molybdenum 

equals 
38 to 62% of the total weight maximum 9% cobalt, preferably 

3.00 to 9.00% cobalt balance iron.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of wear resistant iron based
alloys providing wear, erosion, and corrosion resistant surfaces to
components of industrial equipment.Cobalt bearing hardfacing alloys are used to protect wear
surfaces in industrial applications. StelliteR, a product of Stoody
Deloro, is the most common cobalt based alloy in current use, but it is
very expensive and is not machinable by normal methods and
procedures. Cobalt bearing surface alloys have good resistance to
galling and to cavitation erosion, reasonably good resistance to
abrasion and corrosion, and good weldability by plasma-transferred-arc,
gas-tungsten-arc, and gas-metal-arc welding, the processes most
commonly used to apply these alloys. They are used for hardfacing to
provide wear resistant surfaces. They are also used to protect wear
surfaces in nuclear power plants; however, they are the source of
close to 80 percent of all radiation exposure suffered by plant
maintenance workers.Further information concerning cobalt based alloys is set forth
in an article entitled "The Search for Cobalt-Free Hardfacing Alloys"
appearing in Welding Design & Fabrication, July, 1989, pp. 46-49,
which discusses cobalt free surfacing alloys.The preferred method of hardfacing a surface with an alloy
utilises the bulkweld process of alloy powder and a wire or electrode
melted together in a welding arc and simultaneously welded to a base
plate or a component while melting an amount of the surface thereof
to obtain a weld bond, such as set forth in US Patent No. 3,076,888. 
Other patents illustrating hardfacing are US Patent Nos. 3,000,094;
3,060,307; 3,062,948; 3,407,478; 3,494,749; 3,513,288;
3,517,156; 3,588,432; and 3,609,292.EP-A-0265165 discloses wear-resistant, cobalt-free hardfacing
iron based alloys for construction of plant or manufacturing facility
components. The alloys have a microstructure consisting of an
austenitic matrix and eutectic alloy carbides and a composition by
weight of 0.85-1.4% carbon, 5-13% manganese, 1.5-5.5% silicon,
18-27% chromium, 4-12% nickel, up to 6% molybdenum, 0.1-0.3%
nitrogen, 0-1% vanadium, 0-1% niobium, 0-1% titanium, 0-1%
tantalum and the balance is iron.GB-A-2 128 633 discloses an iron-based alloy having an austenitic structure with a
composition overlapping the claimed one except for the silicon content.It would be highly advantageous to provide a hardfacing alloy
having a substantially reduced cobalt content than those in common
use today, which is substantially less expensive over the more
commo
