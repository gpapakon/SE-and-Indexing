<ABSTRACT>
It is usual for photographic material to 
follow a set path along which the material is 

transported through various processing stages in 
photographic processing apparatus. The apparatus is 

arranged so that the material is transported 
therethrough in one direction only, passing from one 

processing stage to the next in a pre-arranged 
sequence. However, it may be desired to re-visit a 

processing stage positioned upstream of the processing 
stage from which the material has just exited. 

Described herein is apparatus in which material being 
processed can be directed from one processing stage to 

any other processing stage regardless of its 
positioning within the apparatus. Two processing 

tanks (10, 20) containing processing solution (18, 28) 
and processing racks (11, 21) submerged therein, are 

connected together by means of two tracks (30, 40). 
Each track (30, 40) transports the material in either 

a forward direction or a reverse direction as 
indicated by arrows 32 and 42 respectively. A 

plurality of track portions (310, 311, 312, 313, 314, 
315, 316, 317) connect each processing rack (11, 21) 

with the two tracks (30, 40). A plurality of switches 
(102, 202, 300, 302, 400, 402) are provided for 

directing the material either from one of the tracks 
(30, 40) into respective ones of the processing racks 

(11, 21) or from one of the processing racks (11, 21) 
on to one of the tracks (30, 40).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
photographic processing apparatus and is more
particularly concerned with processing apparatus in
which the direction of motion of the material being
processed can be reversed, that is, the material can
be transported from a downstream processing tank to an
upstream processing tank.It is usual for photographic material to
follow a set path along which the material is
transported through various processing stages in
photographic processing apparatus. The apparatus is
arranged so that the material is transported
therethrough in one direction only, passing from one
processing stage to the next in a pre-arranged
sequence. Each processing stage is different, for
example, the material is transported through the
developer stage, followed by the bleach, fix, and wash
stages.EP-A-0 456 685 describes a photographic
processing unit which comprises a plurality of
processing stages, the material to be processed being
transported through each stage to effect processing.
In each of the processing stages, the material is
cycled around in a given direction until treatment in
that stage has been completed.On completion of a particular treatment, the
material is then switched out of that processing stage
and into the next processing stage. However, the
processing stages of the unit described in
EP-A-0 456 685 follow a pre-arranged sequence, and it
is not possible to transport the material back to a
processing stage which has already been visited. JP-A-04/149549 discloses photographic
processing apparatus in which the direction of
transportation of the material being processed is
changed intermittently whilst the material is in a
processing tank. This reciprocative movement of the
material in the processing solution improves the
agitation of the solution and as a result enhances the
development process by eliminating irregularities in
the processing.However, it is desired, in accordance with
the processing chemistry used, to pass the material
through one or more processing stages for a second
treatment in order to optimize the results obtained
during processing. For example, it may be necessary
to rinse the material being processed after each
stage, that is, the material sequentially passes
through the following stages: developer, rinse,
bleach, rinse, fix, rinse and wash.In current photographic processing
apparatus, three separate rinsing stages as well as a
wash stage will need to be provided if this sequence
of stages is to be followed.It is therefore one object of the present
invention
