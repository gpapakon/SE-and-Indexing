<ABSTRACT>
A method of for arresting the growth of both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent 
benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and prostatic carcinoma in humans 

is disclosed using antibodies specifically reactive against human prostate specific 
antigen (PSA) is disclosed. The invention also includes the active immunization of 

male subjects against androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostatic 
hypertrophy and hyperplasia by using a vaccine capable of inducing anti-PSA 

antibodies on administration, the vaccine containing PSA linked to an immunogenic 
carrier such as diphtheria toxin.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the immunotherapy treatment of prostatic 
hypertrophy in males. More particularly, it relates to arresting or preventing the 
growth of androgen-dependent and/or androgen-independent benign prostatic 
hypertrophy or carcinoma cells in the (eg. human) prostate as well as to the 
immunization of males against both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent 
prostatic hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The invention is based on the generation of antibodies specifically reactive against 
human prostate specific antigen (PSA) and their use in immunotherapy for stopping 
or preventing specifically the growth of prostate cancer cells. The invention also 
includes a vaccine consisting of a prostate specific antigen linked to an immunogenic 
carrier for the induction of antibodies reactive against prostate specific antigen 
(PSA). The prostate, or more correctly prostate gland, is a pale, firm, partly muscular 
partly glandular body surrounding the base of the urinary bladder in man and other 
animals which discharges its viscid opalescent secretion through ducts opening into 
the floor of the urethra. With age, the prostate undergoes hypertrophy or 
enlargement leading to a fairly common and well-recognized syndrome known as 
benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). In fact, prostatic hypertrophy affects more 
than two thirds of all males over the age of fifty. Of those so affected, a percentage 
progresses to carcinoma of the prostate and indeed adenocarcinoma of the prostate is 
now the second highest killer of male human beings due to cancer. Prostatic hypertrophy or hyperplasia as well as carcinoma of the prostate are to an 
extent believed to be dependent on the presence of the male sex hormone, 
testosterone. The existing therapy hitherto employed to treat prostatic hypertrophy 
is based on removal of the source of androgens. This therapy has included 
orchiectomy and/or treatment with anti-androgens and inhibitors of 5-α-reductase  
 
which convert testosterone into its active intracellular form dihydrotestosterone 
(DHT). An alternative therapy recently introduced is to use an antagonist of the decapeptide 
LHRH, which by restricting androgen production, brings about therapeutic benefits. 
Immunization against LHRH by a vaccine (see UK Patent No. 2228262) also leads 
to marked atrophy of the prostate in rats and monkeys. The following references 
can be quoted in this connection: N. Shastri, S.K. Manhar and G.P. Talwar, "Important role of the carrier in the 
induction of antibody
