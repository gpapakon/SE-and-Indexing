<ABSTRACT>
Additive compositions comprising ethylene-vinyl 
acetate copolymers suitable for use in molding 

compositions are disclosed. The ethylene-vinyl 
acetate copolymers have a low degree of crystallinity 

which can provide a desirable balance of 
pigmentability, shrinkage resistance and solubility 

in styrene when used in molding compositions 
containing the ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to molding compositions and,
more particularly, to improved ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers
useful as additives in the molding compositions.Wet mix molding processes are processes which utilize an
unthickened, i.e., liquid molding composition. The molding
composition is typically introduced into a mold which contains a
substrate such as, for example, a fiberglass mat, and is molded, e.g.,
by compression molding, to produce a desired article.Typical wet mix molding processes include, for example,
pultrusion molding, preform molding and wet mat molding.
Pultrusion molding involves pulling a substrate material through a
bath containing the molding composition and then through suitable
dies or fixtures which shape and cure the molding composition.
Examples of molded articles produced by pultrusion, include, for
example, plastic pipes, ladder rails, rods, and support beams such as
I-beams. In preform molding, the molding composition is applied to
a preformed substrate, usually fiberglass, having the shape of the
desired article and cured in a heated matched die mold. Examples of
molded articles produced by the preform process include, for
example, automobile fenders and hoods, chairs and helmets. In wet
mat molding, the molding composition is applied to a sheet of
fiberglass mat, placed in a mold of a comparatively simpler geometry
than a preform mold and cured. Examples of molded articles
produced by wet mat processes include, for example, sheet stock for
paneling, table tops and other articles of simple geometry. Often, pigments are added to molding compositions in order to
obtain a desired color in the final molded article. Two problems
which are frequently encountered with pigmented molded articles
are hazing, which is a lack of color depth, and mottling, which is
non-uniform pigmentation.Powdered polyethylene has been used as a shrink control
additive in molding compositions in order to minimize hazing and
mottling. However, polyethylene is not soluble in styrene, which is a
common monomer used in molding compositions. This can lead to
the filtering of polyethylene particles in the substrate materials, e.g.,
fiberglass, and an uneven distribution of the polyethylene throughout
the mold. Moreover, polyethylene does not provide a high degree of
shrinkage resistance in a molded part. As a result, molded articles
with internally pigmented wet mix formulations which contain
polyethylene often exhibit poor surface quality and warpage.Poly(vinyl acetate) has been known to be an
