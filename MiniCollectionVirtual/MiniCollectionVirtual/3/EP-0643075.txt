<ABSTRACT>
A novel peptide having an elastase inhibitor 
activity and being useful as a remedy or preventive for 

diseases caused by elastase is produced by partially 
modifying the constitutive amino acid of HI-8 present 

on the C-terminal side of a human urine trypsin 
inhibitor and having a trypsin inhibitor activity. The 

invention also provides a gene coding for the peptide, 
a plasmid containing the gene, a recombinant microbe 

holding the plasmid, and a process for producing the 
peptide by using the recombinant microbe.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel peptide having a 
pharmacologically useful activity prepared by altering a part of amino 
acids which constitute the peptide having a normal protease inhibitory 
activity, and a producing method thereof. Elastase, which is one of the proteolytic enzymes, have been 
said that it may play an important role in metabolism on the living 
tissue. In particular, elastase, which is secreted from neutrophil 
being one of the lymphocytes, have been known that large amount thereof 
is involved ininfectious disease and inflammation of tissue, and it is 
closely anticipated in protection against infection and regeneration of 
damaged tissue. On the other hand, protein having elastase inhibitory 
activity is also produced in the living body, and there is a mechanism 
to control not to excessivly degrade the living tissue by neutralizing 
the excess elastase activity [Ann. Rev. Med. 36, pp. 207-216 (1985)]. As stated above, usually, although homeostasis between an 
activity of elastase and that of elastase inhibitory protein, which is 
strictly regulated in the living body, is maintained, when this balance 
is once lost with some factors, the various disease aspects will be 
generated. For example, when the elastase activity is enhanced, 
diseases such as pulmonary emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibroma,  
 
adults respiration depression syndrome (ARDS) are caused in the lung 
[Metabolism, 29, pp. 41-49 (1992)], and an increase of neutrophil 
elastase activity in the joints is thought to be closely anticipated in 
generation of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, deformative 
arthritis [Agents Actions. 8, pp. 11-18 (1978): Bulletin of 
Pharmacological Society of Japan, 99, pp. 93-107 (1992)]. Further, 
elastase is thought to be concerned with generation of acute and 
chronical inflammatory diseases [Ann. Rev. Med. 36, pp. 207- 216 (1985)]. α 1-anti-trypsin (hereinafter referred to as " α 1-AT") have been 
well known as one of the elastase inhibitory proteins which modulate an 
activity of elastase in the living body. α 1-AT is existed in the blood 
in a large amount, and play a role to inhibit and neutralize the 
elastase activity accelerated partially [Nature, 298, pp. 329-334(1982)]. 
However, since α 1-AT is very susceptible to an oxidization, when the 
air containing the much peroxide owing to smoking and air pollution was 
inhaled continuously, α 1-AT is oxidized with the inhaled peroxide in 
the lung, and elastase inhibitory activity thereof may be lost [Am. Rev.
