<ABSTRACT>
Microprocessor without timer, driven by a clock of specified period, and designed to execute application instructions (6), each one of a specified number of clock periods (8), under the control of software (20) for executing a specified and maximum number of instructions and defined so as to loop back on itself and thus to run continuously during software periods, the microprocessor comprising means (3, 13) for counting the software periods so as to deliver time base signals (14). Application to the control of time displays.

<CLAIMS>
Microprocessor (1) without timer, controlled by a clock
(8) of predetermined period, arranged to execute application

instructions (6), each of a predetermined number of clock periods
(8), under the control of software (20) for executing a

predetermined and maximum number of instructions and defined in
order to loop back on itself and thus to be implemented

continuously during software periods, the microprocessor
comprising means (3, 13) for counting software periods in order

to provide time base signals (14).
Microprocessor according to Claim 1, in which the total
duration of all the instructions of series of instructions of

several applications (20, 30) to be executed following mutual
interruptions (21, 34) is at the most equal to said software

period.
Microprocessor according to Claim 2, in which, in the case
of an interruption in the execution of the instructions of a

first series of instructions (20) by the instructions of a second
series of instructions (30), the instructions of the second

series (30) are substituted for those (22-23) of the first series
(20) until the end of the execution of the former (30) and the

resumption (24) of the execution of the latter (20), without in

as much suspending the implementation of the instructions of the
first series (20) but which at that time are not executed (22-23).
Microprocessor according to one of Claims 1 and 2, whereof
the architecture is of the RISC type, with a single cycle of the

microprocessor per instruction (6).
Microprocessor according to one of Claims 1 to 4, in which
input means (3, 16, 17, 18) are arranged to modify the counting

result of the counting means (3, 13), in order to modify the
delivery rhythm of the time base signals (14). 
Microprocessor according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in which
output means (15) are arranged in order to supply signals for

controlling a step-by-step micromotor (40) driving the hands
of a clock display (41).
