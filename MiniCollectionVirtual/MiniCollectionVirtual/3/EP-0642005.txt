<ABSTRACT>
The optical imaging device comprises, for spectral analysis of a scene, on the one hand a mask (8) arranged in the intermediate image plane (PI), comprising a defined number of slots which each isolate a defined part of the image of the observed scene, the large dimension of the slots being parallel to the lines of elementary detectors constituting the detector (11) and perpendicular to the axis (6) of rotation of the mirror (5) and comprises, on the other hand, a dispersive lens (9) arranged in the vicinity of the refocusing lenses (101, 102) and splitting a defined number of wavelengths coming from the mask (8), the dispersive lens (9) being designed to disperse each wavelength in a defined respective direction in order to cover the entire sensitive surface of the detector (11) when scanning the scene. The applications are, in particular, for spectral analysis of the thermal signature of a target and the detection of gas.

Optical imaging device allowing spectral analysis 
of a scene, including, centred on the same optical axis, 

a mirror (5) which oscillates about an axis of rotation 
(6) perpendicular to the optical axis of the device in 

order to scan the scene and reflects the radiation 
emitted by the scene onto an input objective (7), an 

intermediate image plane (PI) corresponding to the focal 
plane of the input objective (7), and a recovery optical 

system (10
1
, 10
2
) which concentrates the radiation onto 
the sensitive face of a detector (11), characterized in 

that it furthermore includes, for spectral analysis of 
the scene, on the one hand a mask (8) arranged in the 

intermediate image plane (PI) and including a defined 
number of slits (13
1
 to 13
36
) which each transmit a 
defined part of the image of the scene, the long 

dimension of the slits being parallel to rows of 
elementary detectors constituting the detector (11) and 

perpendicular to the axis of rotation (6) of the mirror 
(5) and, on the other hand, a dispersive optical system 

(9) arranged along the optical path of the device in the 
vicinity of the recovery optical system (10
1
, 10
2
) and 
splitting a defined number of wavelengths output by the 

mask (8), the dispersive optical system (9) being 
designed to disperse each wavelength in a defined 

respective direction in order to cover all of the 
sensitive face of the detector (11) when the scene is 

scanned. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in

Device according to either of Claims 1 and 2,  
 

characterized in that the rear face of the mask (8), 
facing the detector (11) is reflective. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the dispersive optical system (9) 

includes a diffraction grating (17) etched onto a 
substrate which is transparent to the radiation emitted 

by the scene in order to promote the diffraction of a 
defined wavelength in a defined direction. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the diffraction grating (17) is etched onto the 

substrate mechanically. 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the diffraction grating (17) is etched onto the 

substrate using a holographic method. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the dispersive optical system (9) 

includes a prism (18) which is transparent to the

transmits only a defined number of wavelengths is 
arranged along the optical path of the device. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the rows (L

) of elementary 
detectors (15

) are arranged in the same plane, as a 
first column (16) and a second column (17) which are 

parallel and respectively include the odd rows (L

being separated laterally by a first defined fixed 

separation (Δ

fixed separation (Δ

Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that the mask (8) and the dispersive 

optical system (9; 17; 18) can be retracted by mechanical 
means, making it possible to change from the spectral 

analysis function to the imaging function of the device, 
and vice versa. 
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the dispersive optical system (9; 17; 18)  

 
furthermore includes a corrective optical system (19) 

making it possible to compensate for the deviation in the 
wavelength of the radiation when changing from the 

spectral analysis function to the imaging function, in 
order to conserve the superposition of the image of the 

mask (8) with the sensitive face of the detector (11). 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the corrective optical system (19) includes a prism 

whose vertex angle (A) is defined by the ratio /(n-1), 
where  is the angle of deviation of the incident ray, 

defined by the dispersive optical system (9; 17; 18) for 
a defined wavelength, and n is the refractive index of 

the prism (19).

detectors (15
