<ABSTRACT>
An x-ray tube comprising a toroidal housing (A) 
composed of multiple sections which are clamped together 

and sealed by elastomeric gaskets (128). An annular 
anode (B) is mounted in the housing with coolant passages 

(12, 14) extending thereadjacent. A rotor (30) is 
rotated within the toroidal housing by a motor (60). At 

least one cathode assembly (C) is mounted to the rotor 
adjacent the anode. The rotor is supported by magnetic 

bearings (40) whose active coils (46) are separated from 
the vacuum region of the tube by a magnetic window (48). 

Alternatively, a series of vanes (136, 138) are provided 
to divide the vacuum region into a high vacuum region 

(132) adjacent the cathode and anode and a low vacuum 
region (134) adjacent the motor (60) which houses 

bearings (40, 150, 152) for rotatably supporting the 
rotor within the housing. An active vacuum pump, 

preferably a ion pump (112) and a getter (114) are 
hermetically sealed into the vacuum region for 

maintaining the vacuum.

<DESCRIPTION>
Throughout this document 1 Torr equals 1,33 x 102 Pa.This invention relates to the art of x or gamma ray
generation. It finds particular application in
conjunction with x-ray tubes for CT scanners and will be
described with particular reference thereto. However,
it is to be appreciated, that the present invention will
find application in conjunction with the generation of
radiation for other applications.Typically, a patient is positioned on a horizontal
couch disposed in a central bore of a CT scanner. An x-ray
tube is mounted on a rotatable gantry portion and
rotated around the patient at a high speed. For faster
scans, the x-ray tube is rotated more quickly. However,
rotating the x-ray tube more quickly decreases the net
radiation per image. As CT scanners have become
quicker, larger x-ray tubes which generate more radiation
per unit time have been required, which, of course, cause
high inertial forces. High performance x-ray tubes for CT scanners and
the like commonly include a stationary cathode and a
rotating anode disk, both enclosed within an evacuated
housing. As stronger x-ray beams are generated, there is
more heating of the anode disk. In order to provide
sufficient time for the anode disk to cool by radiating
heat through the vacuum to surrounding fluids, x-ray tubes
with progressively larger anode disks have been built.The larger anode disk requires a larger x-ray
tube which does not readily fit in the small confined space
of an existing CT scanner gantry. Particularly in a fourth
generation scanner, incorporating a larger x-ray tube and
heavier duty support structure requires moving the
radiation detectors to a larger diameter. This requires
more detectors for the same resolution and provides a
longer path length between the x-ray tube and the
detectors. The longer path length can cause more radiation
divergence and other degradation of the image data. Not
only is a larger x-ray tube required, larger heat exchange
structures are required to remove the larger amount of heat
which is generated.Rather than rotating a single x-ray tube around
the subject, others have proposed using a switchable array
of x-ray tubes, e.g. five or six x-ray tubes in a ring
around the subject. See, for example, U.S. Patent
No. 4,274,005 to Yamamura. However, unless the tubes
rotate only limited data is generated and only limited
image resolution is achieved. If multiple x-ray tubes are
rotated, similar mechanical problems are encountered trying
to move all the tubes quickly and remove all of the heat.Still
