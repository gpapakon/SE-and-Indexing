<DESCRIPTION>
 POWERED REVERSING RATCHET DRIVERFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a power-driven hand tool assembly specifically for driving a socket, and particularly to an improved arrangement whereby the socket and tool assembly incorporate through openings, with the tool assembly also having a reversing mechanism for permitting driving of the socket in either rotational direction.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The standard pneumatically-driven tool assembly contains a driving head for accommodating a standard socket, which driving head and socket do not define a through hole, and hence such assembly is restricted for use in those situations where the nut or bolt head are readily accessible and do not have an outwardly projecting threaded rod or equivalent.In addition, many of the standard pneumatic tools do not incorporate a rotation reversing mechanism since the tools, particularly when used in assembly operations, are normally used for driving bolts or nuts in only a single rotational direction. Further, the known pneumatic tools which do provide for rotational reversing generally accomplish such reversing by use of a complex shifting mechanism, such as by shifting 

interior gears and pawls against the driving yoke, and such reversing mechanisms are typically positioned laterally spaced from the rotational axis of the driven socket.Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved powered driver for a tool, specifically a pneumatic ratchet driver for a socket, which driver not only cooperates with the socket to define a through hole to accommodate extension therethrough of an elongate rodlike member, but which also incorporates a rotational drive reversing mechanism preferably disposed in coaxial relationship to the through opening for permitting simple but manual selection in the direction of rotational drive.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the powered tool driver of the invention includes an elongate hollow housing which defines at one end an elongate handle part in which is provided a powered- driven rotary motor, the latter effecting rotation of an intermediate drive mechanism which couples to a driving yoke provided adjacent the other end of the housing for effecting angular oscillation thereof. This other end of the housing defines a driving head and includes two cantilevered housing parts which project in generally parallel relationship and define a slot therebetween in which the driving yoke is positioned. The yoke and projecting housing parts define an
