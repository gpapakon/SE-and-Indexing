<ABSTRACT>
An adjuster (10) for the inboard\outboard adjustment of a frameless side 
glass has a first block (11) secured to a guide (21) for the side glass 

adjacent the lower end thereof and a second block (12) secured to a 
support panel (25). The first and second blocks (11, 12) have threaded 

apertures (13, 14), the apertures (13, 14) being located coaxially of one 
another, the thread of one aperture (13) being of opposite hand to the 

thread of the other aperture (14). A spindle (15) has threaded portions 
(16, 17) one at each end, the threaded portions (16, 17) corresponding to 

and engaging the threaded apertures (13, 14) of the blocks (11, 12) and a 
hexagonal socket (30) being provided in the end of the spindle (15) by 

which the spindle (15) may be rotated to move the blocks (11, 12) 
together or apart, thereby moving the lower end of the guide (21) inboard 

or outboard relative to the support panel (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the adjustment of frameless side glasses 
in motor vehicles and in particular to an adjuster for providing 
inboard/outboard adjustment of frameless side glasses. Frameless side glasses for vehicle doors are typically located by two or 
more guides which are located between the inner and outer skins of the 
door. There is a requirement to adjust glass after fitting to the door, in 
order to ensure that the glass sealingly engages the body work or hood 
material of the vehicle to produce a water tight seal therewith. DE-U-8621577 discloses a screw adjuster for a vehicle window 
comprising a spindle with oppositely handed threads, one thread engaging 
a corresponding thread associated with a guide rail and the other thread a 
thread associated with a structural component. This adjuster however 
utilises a lock-nut which significantly complicates the adjuster assembly 
and the process of adjustment. According to one aspect of the present invention, an adjuster for the 
inboard/outboard adjustment of a frameless side glass comprises a first 
block adapted to be mounted with respect to a guide for the side glass 
adjacent the lower end thereof and a second block is adapted to be 
mounted with respect a support panel, the first and second blocks having 
apertures which are adapted to be located coaxially of one another when 
the blocks are mounted with respect to the guide and support panel 
respectively, said apertures having screw threads, the screw thread on 
the first block being of the opposite hand to that on the second block, a 
spindle having threads one at each end, corresponding to the threads of 
the first and second blocks, said threads on the spindle engaging the 
corresponding threads on the first and second blocks and means being 
provided for rotation of the spindle characterised in that the first and  
 
second blocks are made of reinforced plastics material which will 
provide a tight engagement with the threads on the spindle. With the adjuster described above, the bottom end of the guide is located 
with respect to the support panel by means of the spindle. The upper end 
of the guide will be mounted with respect to a support member in a 
manner which will permit limited pivotal movement of the guide. The 
guide may then be adjusted by rotating the spindle so that the blocks are 
moved together or apart.  
 The means for rotating the spindle is preferably a slot or socket in the end 
of the spindle, which may be engaged by a screwdriver, Allen key or the
