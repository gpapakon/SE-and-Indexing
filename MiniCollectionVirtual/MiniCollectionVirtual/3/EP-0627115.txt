<ABSTRACT>
The leader block (100) uses a substantially rectangular body (101) that is equipped with two tape guide projections (121, 122) which form, in conjunction with the front (113) of the body (101), a U-shaped channel open at one end and adapted to receive an end (104) of the magnetic tape (103). A cover (102) sandwiches the magnetic tape (103) between the cover (102) and the leader block body (101). Projections (151-153) on cover (102) force the magnetic tape (103) into corresponding grooves (131-133) in the bottom (113) of the U-shaped channel in order to thereby prevent the movement of the end of the magnetic tape (103) with reference to the body (101) of the leader block (100).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to magnetic tape 
cartridges and, in particular, to an improved leader 
block that is attached to one end of the magnetic tape 
contained in the magnetic tape cartridge and which is 
used to extract the tape from the cartridge. It is a problem in the field of 3480-type 
magnetic tape cartridges to provide a leader block 
that securely and precisely fastens to one end of the 
magnetic tape contained in the magnetic tape cartridge 
while also being simple to install on the magnetic 
tape without the use of complicated tools. A 
misalignment of the magnetic tape to the leader block 
can result in the cartridge and the leader block 
becoming jammed in the tape drive. Existing leader 
blocks in use on 3480-type magnetic tape cartridges 
require the use of special installation tools to 
attain the required alignment between the magnetic 
tape and the leader block which makes field 
installation of leader blocks on the 3480-type 
magnetic tape cartridges a difficult task. These existing leader blocks are oriented such 
that the magnetic tape exits the leader block from the  
 
side, as is shown in European Patent Application 
Publication 0 090 086. The side exit of the tape from 
the leader block places a strain on the magnetic tape 
and can interfere with the fit between the leader 
block and the takeup reel. When the leader block is 
fully inserted into the takeup reel, the leader block 
forms a part of the outer circumference of the takeup 
reel and thus the magnetic tape winding surface. Any 
misalignment of the magnetic tape to the leader block 
or a failure to properly seat the leader block in the 
takeup reel results in a non-uniform tape winding 
surface which causes undesirable impressions in the 
magnetic tape as it is wrapped on the takeup reel. 
Finally, special leader block docking mechanisms must 
be employed in order to smoothly seat the leader block 
in the magnetic tape cartridge. While this existing leader block apparatus is 
fairly reliable in its operation, the above noted 
limitations represent detrimental design limitations 
contained therein.  
 The above described problems are solved and a 
technical advance achieved in the field by the 
improved leader block for magnetic tape cartridges 
of the present invention. This leader block is 
simple to install without the use of complex 
installation tools to thereby enable field 
personnel to affix a leader block to a magnetic 
tape cartridge. This leader block also orients the 
magnetic tape to exit the leader block
