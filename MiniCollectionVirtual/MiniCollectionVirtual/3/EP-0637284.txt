<ABSTRACT>
A film leader (16) device for use with microfilm with an upper and lower surface. At least one of the surfaces includes knurling or roughening of a predetermined pattern across a portion of the width and length of that surface. The knurling of a virtual non-slip surface for loading of microfilm (14) into self-loading microfilm (14) reader/printers (10) and the like.

<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-SLIP FILM LEADER AND PROCESS OF MftNUFACTD-RETECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to film leaders generally, and particularly to non-slip film loading leaders for use with microfilm and self loading microfilm reader/printers, and the process of ultrasonically knurling these non-slip film loading leaders. 
BACKGROUND ARTMicrofilm reader/printers have gained universal acceptance as a method for retrieving and making copies of information stored on microfilm. For example, many governmental and legal records are now stored on microfilm, and many libraries store archival newspaper editions on microfilm for compact storage and quick and efficient retrieval. Such storage media allow for large amounts of records and data to be stored in a relatively small space.The microfilm is stored on reels within relatively compact, generally four inch square cartridges which are approximately 1" deep. A starter leader is attached to the hub of the reel contained within the cartridge and then the microfilm is attached to the starter leader. The microfilm is then wound round the cartridge reel. The free-end of the microfilm is then attached to the tab of a loading leader generally made of polyester. While the starter leader, microfilm, and the tab of the loading leader are all sufficiently narrow to be wound round the hub of the cartridge reel between the opposing radial walls of the reel, the body of the loader leader is of sufficient width so as to rest upon the exterior radial walls of the reel and thus engage the reels on the outside of the reel's radial walls. One end of the cartridge has an opening through which the free-end of the loading leader, and subsequently the microfilm itself, passes to be loaded into the appropriate microfilm reader/printer to allow viewing of the material on the microfilm. By storing the microfilm on a reel which itself is mounted within such a closed cartridge, the microfilm is protected from direct sun light, dust, - dirt and excessive handling by the operator. 

 The cartridge is inserted into the loading cavity of the microfilm reader/printer and the operator then causes the free-end of the loading leader to be automatically loaded onto the take-up reel of the microfilm reader/printer. A loading wheel, generally made of rubber, contacts one edge of the loading leader and presses the loading leader against one of the radial walls of the cartridge reel. The loading wheel rotates, engages the loading leader, and causes the loading leader and cartridge opening reel to rotate so as to

CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A film leader device for use with microfilm, comprising: an upper surface and a lower surface, and knurling of a predetermined pattern on at least one of said surfaces, said knurling extending along at least a portion of the length and width of said surface.
2. The device of Claim 1 wherein said device is formed of polyester.
3. The device of Claim 1 wherein said knurling extends along the entire length of said surface.
4. The device of Claim 1 wherein said knurling means extends across about twenty (20) percent of the width of said surface.
5. The device of Claim 3 wherein said knurling is formed ultrasonically.
6. The device of Claim 3 wherein said knurling extends from one edge of said leader across at least a portion of the width of said leader such that said knurling extends at least partially laterally from said edge.
7. The device of Claim 1 wherein said device is formed of a thermoplastic.
8. The device of Claim 1 wherein said knurling may consist of repeatable predetermined pattern. 


 9. A process of manufacturing a non-slip leader device, comprising the steps of: positioning a transducer including a blunt end, a predetermined distance from a wheel including a predetermined knurling pattern, rotating at a predetermined rate; vibrating said transducer at a predetermined rate; passing a predetermined portion of a webbed material between said blunt end and said rotating wheel; and knurling said predetermined portion of the webbed material by the contact with the vibration of said blunt end and said wheel to form a non-slip leader device.
