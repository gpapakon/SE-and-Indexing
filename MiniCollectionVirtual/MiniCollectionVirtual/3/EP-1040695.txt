<ABSTRACT>
A method and system for use in determining the position of a mobile terminal (108) in a CDMA mobile communications system (100) is disclosed, whereby a different than usual spreading code is used when TOA measurements are being performed, but information is allowed to be transmitted while those TOA measurements are being performed. In one embodiment, the length of the different spreading code used is equal to one symbol length. In a second embodiment, a mobile terminal (108) uses a long spreading code and short spreading code prior to making TOA measurements. When TOA measurements are to be made, the serving base station (BS1) orders (204) the mobile terminal (108) to change the spreading code by terminating the use of the long code and continuing use of the short code. Alternatively, when the TOA measurements are to be made, the serving base station (BS1) orders (204) the mobile terminal (108) to substitute a second, predetermined short code for the long code being used, and to continue use of the first short code. The TOA measurements are then performed (210, 212, 214) in at least three base stations (BS1, BS2, BS3), and the position of the mobile terminal (108) is derived from this TOA information (216). The serving base station (BS1) then orders (218) the mobile terminal (108) to resume normal operations using the long code.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR DETERMININGTHE POSITION OF A MOBILE TERMINAL INA CDMA MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Technical Field of the InventionThe present invention relates in general to the to mobile radio communications field and, in particular, to a method and system for use in determining the geographical position of a mobile radio terminal ("geolocation") in a mobile radio system following a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) standard.Description of Related ArtCommonly-assigned U.S. Patent Applications Serial Nos. (Attorney docket nos. 27946-00353 and 27946-00354) filed on November 26, 1997 disclose methods for use in performing position determinations in a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system. The methods include the steps of ordering an intra-cell handoff, receiving in three radio base stations (BSs) repeated access bursts from a mobile radio terminal (mobile station or MS) whose position is to be determined, in each BS incoherently integrating the squared absolute values of those bursts, and determining the uplink time-of-arrival (TOA) by statistically evaluating the TOA results from randomly selected groups of these bursts. The uplink TOA information is used to derive the position of the MS.The IS-95 standard (CDMA) published by the Electronics Industry Association/Telecommunications Industry Association (EIA/TIA) discloses the use of a spreading code for TOA measurements in conjunction with determining the position of a MS. The spreading code used is a long code (LC) with a periodicity of thousands of chips, but it is designed for other uses than position determination- As such, the information superimposed on this LC must be known when using it for position determination purposes.A drawback of the first-mentioned position determination method using 

TOA information is that it is not suitable for use in CDMA systems, because received information in CDMA systems is superimposed on the spreading codes. A drawback of the second-mentioned method is that it is not optimized for use in making position determinations. As such, since determining the position of mobile terminals has become very important in the mobile communications field, it is just as important to have a method that is optimized for this particular purpose.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONOne problem with CDMA systems that the present invention addresses is how to design a spreading code for TOA measurements so that it is not necessary to know the information that is being spread and transmitted.Another problem

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1. A method for determining the position of a mobile terminal in a CDMA mobile radio system, comprising the steps of: for measuring an uplink time of arrival, ordering said mobile terminal to switch from spreading with a first short spreading code and a long spreading code to spreading with at least a second short spreading code; receiving in at least three radio base stations a transmitted signal from said mobile terminal including said at least a second short spreading code; and measuring a time of arrival for said received signal in said at least three radio base stations, using a correlation with said at least a second short spreading code independently of information conveyed in said transmitted signal.
2. The method of Claim 1, wherein the ordering step includes a further step of ordering said mobile terminal to increase power of at least a part of said transmitted signal to a predetermined level.
3. The method of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said at least a second short spreading code comprises said first short spreading code.
4. The method of Claim 1 or 2, wherein said at least a second short spreading code is different from said first short spreading code.
5. The method of Claim 1, wherein said transmitted signal comprises a plurality of at least 160 symbols.
6. The method of Claim 1, wherein the ordering step is completed only if a subscriber of said mobile terminal provides permission.
7. The method of Claim 1 , wherein the measuring step further comprises : filtering said received signal in a filter matched to said at least a second short spreading code to produce a filtered signal; forming an absolute value of said filtered signal; 


 incoherently summing said absolute value to form a summed signal; determining a peak value of said summed signal; and determining said time of arrival from a time of said peak value relative to a reference.
8. The method of Claim 7, wherein the filtering step further comprises forming a squared signal from an absolute value of an output of said matched filter.
9. The method of Claim 7, wherein said at least a second short spreading code is optimized with respect to correlation properties for position determination.
10. The method of Claim 9, wherein said at least a second short spreading code is one symbol in length, and the auto-correlation properties and cross-correlation to other signals are optimized for position determination.
