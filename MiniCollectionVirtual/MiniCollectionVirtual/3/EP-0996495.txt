<ABSTRACT>
A filtration membrane for micro- or ultra-filtration is formed from a complex of PVDF and calcined  alpha -alumina (" alpha -Al") particles, in which complex the particles are reacted and dispersed. The suspended complex is then mixed with a hydrophilic polymer such as polyvinyl alcohol (40 % - 90 % hydrolyzed) referred to herein as HPVA, which reacts with the complex imparting hydrophilicity to the polymer. The novel membrane provides about 50 % higher specific flux than a membrane made with the same polymer but without the  alpha -Al particles. Unexpectedly, the net flux is improved by treating the membrane with a solution of sodium hypochlorite which fails to remove the HPVA from the novel membrane but does remove it from the prior art membrane which does not contain the  alpha -Al. The preferred membrane comprises a macroporous support coated on its outer surface with a thin tubular asymmetric semipermeable film of polymer containing less than about 50 % by weight of  alpha -Al particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF)
membrane of organic polymer for filtering a desired liquid from a liquid mass
referred to herein as a "substrate".The membrane may be in the form of a capillary tube or hollow fiber
membrane (or "fiber" for brevity), or, in the form of a tubular sheath of film
formed either on the inner or outer surface of a tubular macroporous support; or
a laminar sheet or film; or a laminar sheet or film deposited on a porous
support. In the art, a hollow fiber of microporous polymer; or, a tube of braid
having a nominal inside diameter of less than 2.5 mm, coated with a
semipermeable film of microporous polymer, is referred to as a hollow fiber
membrane. A hollow fiber membrane which does not require a support, by
definition, is self-supporting. A tubular .sheath of thin film of polymer, by itself,
or a sheet of thin film, by itself, is non-self-supporting and must be supported.
The term "membrane" is used to refer to a film or sheet or the hollow fiber
membrane in its entirety, irrespective of the form in which it is deployed. A
particular example of a hollow fiber membrane is an extruded hollow fiber
membrane with an outer diameter in the range from about .25 mm to 2.5 mm
and a wall thickness in the range from about .15 mm to 1 mm, typically being in
the range from about 5% to about 40% of the outside diameter of the fiber.
The average pore cross sectional diameter in a fiber may vary widely. For MF,
the average pore diameter is in the range from about 0.08 µm to about 2.0 µm,
preferably from about 0.1 - 1 µm. For UF, the average pore diameter is
preferably in the range from about 0.01 µm to 0.1 µm. An example of a
supported membrane is a flexible laminar sheet; or a tube of knitted or woven
flexible braid coated with the tubular film, the tube having an outside diameter
in the range from about 0.5 mm to about 5 mm. For the sake of clarity,
reference to the film, by itself, is made with the term "film membrane", or "thin
film" or "film" for brevity, since without the film there would be no membrane. 
Since the support for a film membrane has macropores which are very large
relative to pores within the film, they are referred to herein as "voids".A tubular sheath of non-supporting film has such a thin wall, in the range
from 0.01 mm to 0.09 mm thick, that the tube will collapse unless supported by
fluid. If a thin sheet of film 0.09 mm thick is either extruded or cast, a piece of
the film in a small square 10 cm on each side, has so little
