<ABSTRACT>
An open-vane regenerative turbine pump (20) 
includes a housing (52), an impeller (54) rotatably 

supported on the housing (52) having a plurality of 
paddle-like open-vane type vanes (82) thereon, an 

annular pump channel (90) in the housing (52) around 
the periphery of the impeller (54) and around the 

vanes (82), a stripper (98,100) in the pump channel 
(90) between an inlet port (104) of the latter and a 

discharge port (108) thereof, and a pair of bosses 
(110,112) on the housing (52) in the pump channel (90) 

on opposite sides of the impeller (54) about midway 
between the inlet and discharge ports (104,108). The 

bosses (110,112) each have an edge (114,116) 
obstructing a radially inner fraction of the pump 

channel (90) to intercept inertially-separated vapour 
in the inner fraction having a velocity component in 

the direction of rotation of the impeller (54). A 
pair of notches (118,120) are formed in the housing 

(52) adjacent respective ones of the bosses (110,112) 
in flow communication with a vapour collection chamber 

(92) and with a radially innermost extremity of the 
pump channel (90). The momentum of the intercepted 

vapour induces flow thereof through the notches 
(118,120) to the vapour collection chamber (92) for 

maximum scavenging of vapour from the pump channel 
(90).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to open-vane 
regenerative turbine pumps. US-A-3,881,839, issued 6 May 1975, describes 
an electric fuel pump assembly which operates 
submerged in fuel in a fuel tank of a motor vehicle 
and which includes an open-vane regenerative turbine 
pump. A plurality of paddle-like radial vanes on a 
rotating impeller of the pump induce fluid flow in a 
pump channel defined by an annular groove in a housing 
of the pump around the periphery of the impeller. 
Vapour which is inertially separated from liquid fuel 
in the pump channel is expelled therefrom through 
bleed holes in the pump housing near the radially 
innermost extremity of the pump channel. In an 
open-vane regenerative turbine pump of an electric 
fuel pump assembly described in US-A-3,418,991, issued 
31 December 1968, predetermined lateral clearance 
between the pump housing and the sides of the impeller 
defines elongated vapour bleed slots on opposite sides 
of the impeller at the radially innermost extremity of 
the pump channel through which inertially-separated 
vapour is expelled. An open-vane regenerative turbine 
pump according to this invention has improved vapour 
scavenging characteristics relative to the open-vane 
regenerative turbine pumps described in the aforesaid 
US-A-3,881,839 and US-A-3,418,991. This invention is a new and improved 
open-vane regenerative turbine pump for application in 
an electric fuel pump assembly operating submerged in 
fuel in a fuel tank of a motor vehicle. The 
regenerative turbine pump according to this invention 
includes an open-vane impeller having paddle-like 
vanes extending radially out from a ring-shaped body 
of the impeller, an annular groove in a housing of the  
 
pump defining a pump channel around the periphery of 
the impeller and the vanes, a stripper on the pump 
housing fitting close around the impeller between an 
inlet port of the pump channel and a discharge port of 
the pump channel, and a pair of bosses on the pump 
housing partially obstructing the pump channel on 
opposite sides of the impeller about midway between 
the inlet and the discharge ports. 
Inertially-separated vapour in the pump channel having 
a velocity component in the direction of rotation of 
the impeller is intercepted and re-directed radially 
inwards by the bosses into a vapour collection chamber 
radially inboard of the pump channel through notches 
in the pump housing adjacent the bosses. The invention and how it may be performed 
are hereinafter particularly described with reference
