<ABSTRACT>
A transdermal delivery system is described, including a 
backing layer having coated thereon an active drug-containing 

adhesive layer which includes (a) an acrylic-based adhesive which 
is self-crosslinking at a temperature of from about 20°C to about 

65°C and (b) an active drug. A method for manufacturing a 
transdermal delivery system is also described, 
including (A) 
mixing an active drug with an acrylic-based adhesive solution 

which is self-crosslinking at a temperature of from about 20°C 
to about 65°C to form an active drug-adhesive mixture, (B) 

forming a coating of the active drug-adhesive mixture on a 
backing layer, and (C) drying the coating to form an active drug-containing 

adhesive layer. Examples of the active drug include 
nitroglycerin and estradiol.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to articles of manufacture for the 
delivery of an active drug transdermally and to a method for the 
manufacture thereof. In particular, this invention relates to 
a system useful for the efficacious delivery of an active drug, 
such as nitroglycerin or estradiol, transdermally and to a method 
for the manufacture thereof. Numerous patents have issued for the delivery of active 
drugs, such as the delivery of nitroglycerin to the skin in the 
treatment of angina pectoris and/or the treatment of congestive 
heart failure. Some formulations require complex reservoirs, such as 
encapsulated or walled containers having interior drug-containing 
chambers (e.g., microcapsules) and/or multiple layers, as 
described by Zaffaroni in Canadian Patent 930668. Other transdermal systems require a drug-loaded matrix, as 
disclosed by Zaffaroni in U.S. Patent 3,921,636 and by Kydonieus 
et al in U.S. Patent 4,758,434 describing prior Hercon 
technology. The prior Hercon technology is directed to a PVC 
plastisol, and both the Zaffaroni and Kydonieus patents utilize 
a drug loaded polymeric matrix which acts as the reservoir. 
Thus, neither transdermal system adheres to the skin by itself, 
but rather requires the assistance of a pressure-sensitive  
 
adhesive, located around the periphery of the reservoir or as a 
separate layer covering the face of the reservoir, for attachment 
to the patient. Transdermal devices having nitroglycerin intimately 
dispersed or solubilized within an adhesive polymer or copolymer 
are described by Ito et al in U.S. Patent 4,421,737, by Ito in 
U.S. Patent 4,505,891, by Wick in U.S. Patent 4,751,087, by 
Striker et al in U.S. Patent 4,409,206, and by Sablotsky in PCT 
Application W086/00814. The nitroglycerin-containing adhesive 
is subsequently coated onto an impervious backing sheet. Ito et al (U.S. Patent 4,421,737) describes a pressure-sensitive 
medicinal adhesive tape or sheet containing 
nitroglycerin in which a tackified rubber-based adhesive is 
coated onto a backing. Softeners for rubber-based adhesives 
(e.g., mineral oil, long chain fatty acid esters, lanolin 
derivatives, and hydrogenated fats and oils) and nitroglycerin 
must be added in a separate coating step. This separate step 
requires that the coatings come into intimate contact while aging 
the material at an elevated temperature, thus allowing for the 
nitroglycerin and softeners to be transferred together to the 
rubber-based adhesive through diffusion. The manufacture of such 
an article

A transdermal delivery system comprising a backing 
layer having coated thereon an active drug-containing 

adhesive layer comprising

at a temperature of from about 20oC to about 

65oC, and 
(b) an active drug. 
A transdermal delivery system as claimed in claim 
1, wherein the active drug is nitroglycerin, preferably 

in an amount of from 50 to 65% by weight, based on the 
total dry weight of the adhesive layer. 
A transdermal delivery system as claimed in claim 
1 or claim 2, wherein the adhesive is an acrylic

enhancer in an amount of from 2 to 60% by weight 

preferably 25 to 45% by weight, based on the total dry 
weight of the adhesive layer.
