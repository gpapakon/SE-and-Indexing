<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the topical application of active 
substances to the human or animal body and in particular to two-component 
compositions intended for mixing together either insitu on 
application, or immediately prior to application. The solubility of active substances in solvent systems is important in 
relation to the design of topical delivery systems. It has been shown that 
the degree of saturation of an active substance, for example a drug, in the 
solvent system or vehicle is a determining factor in controlling release of 
the active substance. Coldman etal.; J. Pharm. Sci., 58, 1098-1102, 1969, demonstrated that 
percutaneous absorption could be enhanced by over-saturating a drug 
solution to a supersaturated level. A supersaturated state is generated 
when the concentration of a solute, for example a drug, in a given solvent 
system exceeds the saturated solubility of the solute in that system. Coldman prepared a solution of a drug in a mixture of a volatile and a 
non-volatile solvent and applied it to the surface of a sample of human 
skin. The volatile solvent evaporated leaving the drug in solution in the 
non-volatile solvent at a concentration in excess of its saturated solubility 
in that solvent, thereby creating a supersaturated solution insitu on the 
skin surface. European Patent Publication No. 0 151 953 describes a pharmaceutical 
composition for generating a drug solution in a supersaturated state 
which is not reliant on the prior evaporation of a volatile solvent. The composition comprises two distinct but miscible liquid phases, at least 
one of which contains a drug dissolved therein. The composition of the 
phases is such that each has a different lipophilicity (or polarity) and thus 
each confers a different saturated solubility on the drug. The composition 
of the liquid phases and the concentration of drug in one or both phases is 
such that on admixture of the two phases, the total drug concentration in 
the mixture thus formed is greater than the concentration of drug which a 
mixture of the same composition can accommodate as a saturated solution.  
 On mixing the two liquid phases, the resulting mixture is therefore 
supersaturated with respect to the drug. It is an inherent property of supersaturated solutions that they will seek 
to adopt a more thermodynamically stable saturated state. This will 
generally be achieved by precipitation of solute from the supersaturated 
solution. The tendency for precipitation and the time scale over which it 
will

<CLAIMS>
A two-phase composition for topical application, wherein the two phases are 
intended to be mixed together on or immediately prior to application, comprising:
 
   a first, non-aqueous liquid phase containing a drug dissolved therein and 

comprising a topically acceptable non-aqueous and non-volatile solubiliser; and a 
second, non-aqueous liquid phase, physically and/or chemically different from the first 

phase but miscible therewith on admixture, optionally containing the same drug 
dissolved therein and comprising a topically acceptable non-aqueous and non-volatile 

carrier; the composition of the first and second liquid phases being such that each has a 
different lipophilicity and each confers a different saturated solubility on the drug; the 

concentration of drug in each phase in which it is present and the composition of each 
of the first and second liquid phases being such that, on admixture of the phases, the 

total drug concentration in the mixture thus formed is greater than the saturated drug 
concentration in the same mixture, whereby the said mixture is supersaturated with the 

drug. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 in which the topically acceptable 
solubiliser or carrier is selected from propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol 1,3-propylene 

diol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, liquid paraffin, squalene, 
polydimethylsiloxane (silicone oil), lauryl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, cetyl alcohol, 

stearyl alcohol, oleyl alcohol, hexane-1,2,6-triol, cholesterol, lanolin, lauric acid, 
myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acids, vegetable oils, sorbitan, isopropyl 

myristate, isopropyl palmitate, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, dimethylisosorbide, 
dimethylsulphoxide, benzyl alcohol, mixed triglycerides, modified silicones, fatty acid 

esters, mineral oils and other non-volatile glycerol, glycol, ether and ester solvents. 
A composition as claimed in claim 2 in which the solubiliser or carrier is 
benzyl alcohol, a mixed triglyceride, mineral oil or mixtures thereof. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 further comprising a 
volatile solvent in each of the first and second liquid phases, whereby on admixture of 

the phases, the rate of loss of volatile solvent originally present in the first liquid phase 
is comparable to the rate of loss of volatile solvent originally present in the second 

liquid phase, such that the ratio of the total drug concentration in the mixture to the 
saturated drug concentration in the same mixture remains substantially constant.  

 
A composition as claimed in claim 4 in which the volatile solvent component 
in each liquid phase has comparable lipophilicity to the non-volatile component in that 

phase. 
A composition as claimed in claim 5 in which the volatile solvent component 
comprises up to 20% by weight of each of the first and second liquid phases. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 6 in which the volatile 
solvent component of the more lipophilic liquid phase is ethanol, isopropanol or 

acetone. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 4 to 7 in which the volatile 
solvent component of the less lipophilic liquid phase is a volatile silicone oil. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 8 in which the first liquid 
phase is saturated with drug. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 9 in which the relative 
proportion by weight of the first liquid phase to the second liquid phase is from 1:1 to 

1:12. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10 in which the degree of 
saturation on admixture of the first and second liquid phases is in the range 2 to 10. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11 in which the drug is a 
steroid or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. 
A twin compartment pack containing a composition as defined in any one of 
claims 1 to 12, the first liquid phase being in one compartment and the second liquid 

phase being in the other compartment. 
A transdermal device containing a composition as defined in any one of claims 
1 to 12.
