<ABSTRACT>
Nozzle comprising: a sole (3) comprising a duct (11) opening out on the front border (12); a moveable plate (8) carrying a guard (9); a device (20) for adjusting the height of the plate (8); a first spring return device (10) applied to the top of the plate (8); and at least one wheel (16, 17) on which said sole (3) is supported. According to the invention, the sole (3) is mounted in such a way that it can be moved in terms of height in opposition to a second spring return device (29) relative to a pin (30) that carries means (31, 32) providing support on the floor, the adjustment device (20) acting on said pin (30) to give a combined movement of the pin (30) and the sole (3) and defining two positions in which either the front border (12) of the sole (3) occupies a raised position and the guard (9) plate (8) occupies a lowered position, or the front border (12) of the sole (3) occupies a lowered position and the guard (9) plate (8) occupies a raised position.

Nozzle (1) equipping vacuum cleaners and comprising:

a mounting body (2);
a horizontal sole plate (3) integral with the mounting body
(2), forming the base of the said body and having a suction

pipe (4) comprising a duct (11) opening out on the front edge
(12) and on the lateral edges (18, 19) of the sole plate;
a connecting sleeve (5) having a conduit (6) sealingly
connected to the suction pipe (4) of the said sole plate (3);
a movable horizontal plate (8) which carries a flap (9)
extending at least on the side of the plate adjacent to the

rear edge (13) of the sole plate and which is positioned
between the top part of the said horizontal sole plate (3) and

the bottom part of the suction pipe (4);
a device (20) for adjusting the plate (8) for height,
actuatable by a selector (21) movably mounted on the mounting

body (2);
a first elastic return device (10) applied to the top part
of the movable horizontal plate (8) and designed to cause to

occupy, on each side of an unstable intermediate position, two
useful positions for which the movable plate occupies a

lowered position and a raised position; and
at least one carrier wheel (16, 17) mounted so as to rotate
about a shaft carried by the horizontal sole plate (3) and

placed at the rear of the said sole plate (3),

characterised in that the sole plate (3) is mounted so as to
be able to move in height counter to a second elastic return

device (29) with respect to a shaft (30) arranged in the 
middle region of the sole plate and supporting means (31, 32)

bearing on the floor, the device (20) for adjusting the plate
in height acting on the said shaft (30) in order to give a

combined movement acting on the shaft (30) and the sole plate
(3) and defining, on each side of an unstable intermediate

position, two positions in which either the front edge (12) of
the sole plate (3) occupies a raised position and the plate

(8) carrying the flap (9) occupies a lowered position, or the
front edge (12) of the sole plate (3) occupies a lowered

position and the plate (8) carrying the flap (9) occupies a
raised position.
Nozzle according to Claim 1, characterised in that the
height-adjustment device (20) consists of two wedges (33)

fixed to each other, which are positioned on each side of the
suction pipe (4) and one (33) of which is connected to the

selector (21), each wedge (33) having two different active

surfaces (34, 35) in engagement with raising means in order to
act separately on the plate (8) and on the shaft (30), thus

bringing about a combined movement of vertical translation
acting on the plate and of pivoting about the shaft of the

wheel acting on the sole plate (3) in order to obtain a low
position in which the front edge (12) of the sole plate (3)

occupies a raised position and the plate (8) carrying the flap
(9) occupies a lowered position, and a high position in which

the front edge (12) of the sole plate (3) occupies a lowered
position and the plate (8) carrying the flap (9) occupies a

raised position.
Nozzle according to Claim 2, characterised in that the
raising means consist of two inclined planes (40) formed in

the sole plate (3), positioned on each side of the suction
pipe (4), each of the inclined planes (40) extending

transversely with respect to the horizontal sole plate (3)
and, firstly, the bottom edge (44) of which defines with a

part of the top surface of the sole plate (3) a first step
(36) on which the wedge (33) rests in the low position and, 

secondly, the top edge (37) of which defines with another part
of the top surface of the sole plate (3) a second step (38) on

which the wedge (33) rests in the high position, after a
sliding on the said inclined plane (40).
Nozzle according to Claim 3, characterised in that each
of the two wedges has a front region comprising a section

carrying the active surface (34) which is partly slid
underneath the shaft of the bearing means (31, 32), a central

region (43) on which one of the wedges (33) receives a means
(25) of actuating the selector (21), and a rear region

comprising another section carrying the active surface (35)
which is slid underneath the plate (8) whose bottom face has a

notch (45) with an inclined edge (46); the active surface (34)
of the front region and the active surface (35) of the rear

region coming to be positioned respectively, for the low
position, on the one hand between the first step (36) and the

shaft (30), and, on the other hand, in the notch (45), and,
for the high position, on the one hand, between the second

step (38) and the shaft (30) and, on the other hand, out of
the notch (45) on the bottom face of the plate (8).
Nozzle according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
wedge (33) carrying the active surface (34) has a thickness

less than the thickness of the wedge (33) carrying the active
surface (35) so as to obtain a more ample raising of the plate

(8) compared with that of the sole plate (3).
Nozzle according to Claim 4, characterised in that the
inclined edge (46) of the notch (45) has a slope oriented in

the opposite direction to the slope of the inclined plane (40)
of the sole plate (3).
Nozzle according to Claim 6, characterised in that the
inclined plane (40) and the inclined edge (46) are shaped so

that, when going from to the low position to the high position
and vice versa, the wedges (33) slide freely on the sole plate 

(3) when the selector (21) is activated.
Nozzle according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the first elastic device (10) has two

rods (47, 48) which are positioned on each side of the suction
pipe (4) and which each comprise a bottom part fixed to the

sole plate, a body passing successively through a panel (49)
connecting the two wedges (33) and the plate (8) and a top

part delimited by a head (50) whose diameter is greater than
the diameter of the rod body, and two springs (51, 52) which

are slipped on the rods (47, 48) and which each have a bottom
end applied against the top part of the plate (8) and a top

end applied against the head (50).
Nozzle according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the second elastic device (29) has two

other rods (53, 54) which are positioned on each side of the
suction pipe (4), which each comprise a bottom part fixed to

passes the shaft (30) of the wheels (31, 32) and a top part

delimited by another head (55) whose diameter is greater than
the diameter of the rod (53), and two springs (56, 57) which

are slipped onto the rods (53, 54) and which each have a
