<ABSTRACT>
Operating device for automatically unlocking and opening a window leaf (1), including a moving wing (3) and, possibly, a semi-fixed wing (4) in contact with the edge of the moving wing when the window is closed and able to be immobilised temporarily facing the fixed frame (2) of the window case which receives the two wings by means of a blocking mechanism (9). This device is characterised in that it includes, inside a housing (10) of the semi-fixed wing or of the frame, an operating knob (8) able to release an operating rod (18) subjected to the action of a triggering spring (21) and acting in vertical displacement over a cam (25) mounted so that it can pivot about a horizontal spindle (26) supported by the semi-fixed wing or the frame, this cam including a notch (27) for receiving a catch (28) carried by the moving wing, so that the pivoting of the cam inside the housing under the effect of the operating rod controlled by the knob, results in a force on the latch of the moving wing, separating it from the semi-fixed wing, itself eventually released by releasing the blocking mechanism.

Control device for the automatic unlocking and 
opening of a window (1) comprising a movable leaf (3) 

and, where appropriate, a semi-fixed leaf (4) in contact 
with the edge of the movable leaf during the closing of 

the window and capable of being immobilized temporarily, 
relative to the fixed frame (2) of the casement receiving 

the two leaves, by means of a blocking mechanism (9), 
characterized in that it comprises, inside a receptacle 

(10) of the semi-fixed leaf or of the frame, a control 
button (8) capable of freeing an actuating rod (18) 

subjected to the action of a disengaging spring (21) and 
acting by vertical displacement on a cam (25) mounted 

pivotably about a horizontal shaft (26) supported by the 
semi-fixed leaf or the frame, this cam comprising a notch 

(27) for receiving a latch (28) carried by the movable 
leaf, in such a way that the pivoting of the cam in the 

receptacle under the effect of the actuating rod, said 
pivoting being controlled by the button, results in a 

force on the latch of the movable leaf, the said force 
separating it from the semi-fixed leaf or from the frame, 

itself subsequently freed as a result of the release of 
the blocking mechanism. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the control button (8) is mounted slidably by 

depression in a guide (11) provided in the receptacle 
(10) of the semi-fixed leaf (4) or of the frame (2), this 

button being designed to cause the displacement of the 
actuating rod (18) under the action of the disengaging 

spring (21) at a given moment during the sliding of the  
 

said button in the guide. 
Device according to one of Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the control button (8) comprises a 

peripheral groove or a recess (17) which is made in its 
lateral surface and into which engages the end of the 

actuating rod (18) movable through a passage (19) provided 
in the wall of the guide where the button slides. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the actuating rod (18) comprises a 

transverse stop (20) for the bearing of the disengaging 
spring (21) which is compressed between this stop and a 

shoulder (22) provided in the receptacle (10) of the 
semi-fixed leaf (4) or of the frame (2). 
Device according to one of Claims 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the actuating rod (21), at its end 

opposite that which penetrates into the recess (17) of 
the button (8), comprises a connecting dog (23) en
gaged 
in an elongate eye (24) of the cam (25), in an eccentric 

position relative to the pivot shaft (26) of the latter, 
this position being determined in such a way that the 

displacement of the rod simultaneously causes the limited 
rotation of the cam about its shaft, so as to free the 

latch (28) of the movable leaf (3) relative to its stop 
(27). 
Device according to any one of Claims 3 to 5, 
characterized in that the control button (8) is permanently 

subjected to the action of a transverse spring (15) 
mounted between a button face directed towards the inside 

of the sliding guide (11) and the bottom (13) of the 
latter, so as to return the button into the initial 

position after the actuating rod (18) has emerged from 
its recess (17). 
Device according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the disengaging spring (21) is compressed between 

the shoulder (22) provided in the semi-fixed leaf (4) or 
the frame (2) and a bearing extension (34) forming part 

of the actuating rod (18), the latter having, at its end 
opposite the cam (25), a hook-shaped transverse turned-up 

portion (31) in engagement with a rim (32) of the control  
 

button (8), in such a way that the sliding of this button 
by depression in its guide (11) causes the rim to escape 

and free the hook receiving it, thereby pushing the 
actuating rod upwards so as to cause pivoting of the cam. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the hook (31) of the actuating rod (18) and the rim 

(32) of the control button (8) have bevelled chamfers 
(35, 36) having complementary slopes, in such a way that 

the return of the actuating rod downwards as a result of 
the opposite pivoting of the cam (25) during the closing 

of the movable leaf (3), with simultaneous compression of 
the disengaging spring (21), determines the engagement of 

the hook under the rim of the control button, thereby 
rearming the device. 
Device according to any one of Claims 4 to 8, 
characterized in that the actuating rod (18) is fixed to 

an intermediate piece (37) mounted slidably with the 
displacement of the rod in a housing (39) provided in the 

receptacle (10) of the semi-fixed leaf (4) or the frame 
(2), this intermediate piece having an offset (42), in 

which engages a detent nose (43) carried by the cam (25), 
the disengaging spring (21) being mounted between this 

piece and the shoulder (22) provided in the semi-fixed 
leaf or the frame. 
Device according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that the pivoting cam (25) is associated with a leaf 

spring (44) which is fixed to the inner wall (39c) of the 
housing (39) of the receptacle (10) of the semi-fixed 

leaf (4) or of the frame (2) and which is capable of 
causing this cam to pivot about its horizontal shaft 

(26), after the retraction of the intermediate piece (37) 
together with the actuating rod (18) and the disengagement 

of the detent nose (43) relative to the offset (42) 
of this piece. 
Device according to any one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that the actuating rod (18) comprises a 

prolongation (45) connected by means of a cable (46) to 
an espagnolette bolt (47) mounted slidably relative to 

the semi-fixed leaf (4) and carried by the latter, this  
 

espagnolette bolt locking this leaf relative to the frame 
(2) by penetrating into a keeper (49) provided opposite 

the latter, the pivoting of the cam simultaneously giving 
rise, by a pull on the cable, to the downward displacement 

of the espagnolette bolt out of its keeper with the 
displacement of the actuating rod. 
Device according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the espagnolette bolt (47) comprises one end (48) 

cut in a bevel (50), capable of cooperating with an 
inclined face (51) of identical slope provided on the 

frame (2) at the open end of the keeper (49), in such a 
way that the opening movement of the semi-fixed leaf (4) 

can be executed after the deflection of the movable leaf 
(3) consecutively to a force of low amplitude exerted on 

the semi-fixed leaf in this opening direction. 
Device according to one of Claims 11 or 12, 
characterized in that the espagnolette bolt comprises a 

base (52) mounted slidably in the receptacle (10) of the 
semi-fixed leaf (4), this base being fixed to that end of 

the cable (46) which is connected to the actuating rod 
(18), a complementary return spring (55) being arranged 

between this base and a shoulder (57) of the semi-fixed 
leaf (4). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the window comprises a second actuating rod (58) 

parallel to the first (18) and capable of cooperating 
with a second recess (59) of the control button (8), the 

said second recess being offset in depth relative to the 
first (17) in the direction of the depression of the 

button in its guide (11), in such a way that the sliding 
of this button causes first the freeing of the movable 

leaf (3) by the displacement of the first actuating rod 
(18) and then that of the semi-fixed leaf (4) by the 

displacement of the second rod (58).
