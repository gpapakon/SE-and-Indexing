<ABSTRACT>
There is disclosed a non-adhesive tape holder (20) which comprises a 
drum body (21), a tape restraining member (22), a coil spring (23), and a 

rotation-preventing projection (30). The tape restraining member (22) is bent 
into a generally inclined U shape and includes a support shaft portion (32), a 

connecting portion (33), and a tape hold-down portion (34). The support shaft 
portion (32) is supported by the drum body (21) rotatably about an axis parallel 

to the axis of the drum body (21) in a position eccentric relative to the axis of 
the drum body (21). The coil spring (23) is housed in a spring-receiving recess 

(27) of the drum body (21) and elastically urges the tape restraining member 
(22) to rotate the tape restraining member (22) about the axis of the support 

shaft portion (32). The connecting portion (33) of the tape restraining member 
(22) rotated by the urging force of the coil spring (23) abuts against the 

rotation-preventing projection (30) movably toward and away from the rotation-preventing 
projection (30). The non-adhesive tape holder (20) provides 

increased operating efficiency during tape winding.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a non-adhesive tape holder suitable for 
holding and winding a non-adhesive tape such as a vinyl tape. Wound tapes are of two types: adhesive tapes and non-adhesive tapes. In 
general, adhesive tapes are often used from the standpoint of operating 
efficiency. In consideration for recycle of automotive parts or the like, it is however 
difficult to disassemble harnesses around which the adhesive tape is wound. 
Further, the adhesive tape itself is not suitable as a recyclable material because 
it includes adhesives applied thereon. Applications of the non-adhesive tape are expected to increase as the rate 
of recycling automotive parts increases in future. A non-adhesive tape holder 
for more efficient storage of this type of non-adhesive tape and more efficient 
operation in tape winding is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. 
36-27700. Referring to Figs. 5 and 6, the disclosed non-adhesive tape holder 1 
comprises: a case 5 including a drum body 3 to be inserted into a central hole 
2a of a non-adhesive tape 2 from one side thereof and a hollow cylindrical 
portion 4 extending perpendicularly to the axis of the drum body 3; a tape  
 
restraining member 9 including a leg portion 7 within the case 5 having a 
projection 6 provided adjacent its lower end and fitted in a groove 4a of the 
hollow cylindrical portion 4, the leg portion 7 being vertically movable, and a 
tape hold-down portion 8 external to the case 5 and extending perpendicularly 
to the leg portion 7; and a coil spring 10 fitted between the inner wall of the 
case 5 and the projection 6 of the leg portion 7. For holding the non-adhesive tape 2, the tape restraining member 9 is 
extracted against the elastic force of the coil spring 10 outwardly to an amount 
larger than the outer diameter of the non-adhesive tape 2. In this state, the 
drum body 3 of the case 5 is inserted into the central hole 2a of the non-adhesive 
tape 2. When the tape restraining member 9 is released, the elastic 
force of the coil spring 10 forces the tape hold-down portion 8 of the tape 
restraining member 9 against the non-adhesive tape 2 from outside. The non-adhesive 
tape 2 is held without coming unwound. In the construction of the conventional non-adhesive tape holder 1, 
however, the tape restraining member 9 is extracted to the amount larger than 
the outer diameter of the non-adhesive tape 2, and the non-adhesive tape 2 is 
held by the elastic force of the coil spring 10. This necessitates a relatively 
great

A non-adhesive tape holder (20) for holding a non-adhesive wound tape (24), 
comprising:
 
   a drum body (21) having a recess (27) and received in a central hole (25a) of said wound 

tape,
 
   a tape restraining member (22) rotatably supported by said drum body (21),
 
   an urging element (23) for elastically urging said tape restraining member so as 

to rotate said tape restraining member (22), and
 
   a rotation-preventing projection (30) for regulating the rotation of said tape-restraining 

member,
 
   said tape restraining member (22) being of a generally inclined U shape and 

including a support shaft portion (32) supported by said drum body (21) rotatably about 
an axis parallel to the axis of said drum body (21) in a position eccentric relative 

to the axis of said drum body (21), a connecting portion (33) extending perpendicularly 
to the axis of said support shaft portion (32) from one end of said support shaft 

portion (32), and a tape hold-down portion (34) extending perpendicularly to the axis of 
said connecting portion (33) from an extending end of said connecting portion (33),
 
   said urging element (23) being housed in said recess (27) of said drum body (21) for 

engaging said support shaft portion (32) to elastically urge said tape restraining 
member (22) for rotation of said tape restraining member (22) about the axis of said 

support shaft portion (32),
 
   said rotation-preventing projection (30) being provided on one end surface of 

said drum body (21) so that said connecting portion (33) of said tape restraining member (22) 
rotated by the urging force of said urging element (23) abuts against said rotation-preventing  

 
projection (30) movably toward and away from said rotation-preventing 

projection (30). 
The non-adhesive tape holder (20) of claim 1, wherein
 
   said drum body (21) further includes a generally cylindrical outer peripheral 

portion and a finger-receiving recess (29) formed by partially notching said outer 
peripheral portion from one side surface. 
The non-adhesive tape holder of claim 1, wherein
 
   said drum body (21) further includes a slot (26) extending in its axial direction,
 
   said support shaft portion (32) includes a locking groove (35) at one end,
 
   said urging element (23) is a coil spring, and
 
   said coil spring has a first end (23a) locked by said slot of said drum body and 

a second end (23b) locked by said locking groove (35) of said support shaft portion. 
The non-adhesive tape holder of claim 3, wherein
 
   said locking groove (35) is formed in a slot configuration at an end of said 

support shaft portion (32), and
 
   said locking groove (35) at its opening end is compressedly deformed to be 

narrowed to prevent the second end (23b) of said locked coil (23) spring from being 
released therefrom. 
The non-adhesive tape holder of claim 1, wherein
 
   said tape hold-down portion (34) has an axis inclined at a slight angle with 

respect to the axis of said drum body (21).
