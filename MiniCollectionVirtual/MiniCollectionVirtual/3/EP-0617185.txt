<ABSTRACT>
When the bolt of an electronic lock is retracted to its 
unlocked position without the lock having received an 

authorized combination, the microprocessor (44) of the 
lock electronics (24) is powered by alternate power 

source (21) for a time sufficient to record an 
indication of a covert entry in a non-volatile memory 

(43). Upon subsequent normal operation, during which 
the microprocessor (44) is powered by the main power 

source (36), the indication of covert entry is read from 
the memory (43) and displayed on an LCD display (18) to 

inform the operator that covert entry has occurred. The 
lock may permit its opening with an authorized 

combination after display of the covert entry 
indication, or, alternatively, the lock may be disabled 

as a result of the detection of a covert entry such that 
it will not accept authorized combinations until it has 

been reset or reconditioned to remove the covert entry 
indications stored in the memory (43).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for indicating covert 
entry into secure containers and, more specifically, relates 
to the controls that will indicate to the operator of a high 
security combination lock on a secure container that the 
lock has been covertly entered or operated. Many safes and security containers have high security 
combination locks installed thereon. The locks on the 
cabinet or container are subject to many types of attack in 
an effort to open the lock. Attacks may range from 
destruction of the lock itself, an attack such that the 
operator cannot detect that the lock has been attacked, 
violated or compromised, and further to an attack such that 
an expert cannot detect that the lock has been violated or 
compromised. For a high security lock to be used for the highest level of 
protection such as that used for the most sensitive 
documents, United States government standards require that a 
lock be approved under Federal Specification FF-L-2740. The 
lock must be able to withstand attack for a period of thirty 
minutes; additionally, any access through such a lock must 
not be detectable by the operator. The type of attack and 
entry which is undetectable to the operator is known as a 
covert entry. Covert entry and covert attack are 
particularly pernicious since the authorized operator does  
 
not know that the contents of the safe or security container 
have been compromised. By virtue of the fact that the lock 
appears to have not been violated or tampered with but which 
in fact has been compromised, National security secrets 
which are believed to be secure thereafter may be relied 
upon in the normal course of governmental business; the 
results of such reliance on secrets which have been 
compromised without the knowledge of the custodian of those 
secrets can be particularly ruinous. A great deal of effort has gone into the design of locks, 
containers and other devices which will resist covert attack 
and covert entry. The most efficient way to resist covert 
attack or entry is to design the lock so that the operator 
must be able to observe and recognize signs which indicate 
any type of attack. The obvious observable signs of a 
physical attack include disruptions in the surface of the 
security container, mars, scratches or other abuse 
indicators on the lock dial or lock housing. A lock also should reveal its compromised status if a covert 
entry should occur. With the revelation that covert entry 
has occurred with respect to a lock and this covert entry 
having
