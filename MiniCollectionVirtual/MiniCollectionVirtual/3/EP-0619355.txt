<ABSTRACT>
The sealing compounds according to the invention are based on mercapto-terminal liquid oligomers and contain plasticisers, fillers and additives and also, as hardeners, acrylic or methacrylic compounds having at least two acrylic or methacrylic groups per molecule and, as hardening catalyst, a guanidine derivative. The sealing compounds are distinguished by improved adhesion to glass, especially after UV irradiation.

<CLAIMS>
Sealant containing liquid mercapto-terminated oligomers having at least two mercapto
groups per molecule, acrylic or methacrylic compounds having at least two acrylic or

methacrylic groups per molecule, a guanidine derivative as curing catalyst, plasticizer
and usual fillers or additives, 
characterized in
 that it contains the acrylic or methacrylic
compounds as sole curing agents and in such an amount that the stoichiometric ratio

of mercapto groups to acrylic or methacrylic groups is within the range of from 1 : 1
to 1 : 1.5.
Sealant according to claim 1, 
characterized in
 that it contains as acrylic or methacrylic
compounds a reaction product of a liquid mercapto-terminated oligomer with a di- or

polyacrylate or methacrylate.
Sealant according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
 that it contains as guanidine
derivative tetramethyl, diphenyl, di-o-tolyl guanidine or o-tolylbiguanide.
Sealant according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
 that it contains the
guanidine derivative in an amount of from 0.05 to 2 parts by weight per 10 parts by

weight of the acrylic or methacrylic compounds.
Sealant according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 that it contains additionally
a carboxylic acid as retarder.
Sealant according to claim 5, 
characterized in
 that it contains the carboxylic acid in an
amount of from 0.1 to 1 part by weight per 10 parts by weight of the acrylic or

methacrylic compounds.
Sealant according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in
 that it contains stearic or isostearic
acid as carboxylic acid.
Sealant according to one of-the claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in
 that it consists of a
component A containing the liquid mercapto-terminated oligomer, the plasticizer, the 

fillers and additives, and a component B containing the acrylic or methacrylic compounds,
the curing catalyst and optionally plasticizer, fillers and/or retarder.
Use of a sealant according to one of the claims 1 to 8 to bond and seal glass, especially
for the production of insulating panes of glass.
