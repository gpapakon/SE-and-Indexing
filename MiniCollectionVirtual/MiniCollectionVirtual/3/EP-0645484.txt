<ABSTRACT>
The linear-shed loom is subdivided into a first subassembly (1) containing a weaving rotor (3) and an arrangement (4) for the fabric run, a second subassembly (5) containing a warp beam (23) and an arrangement (7) for the warp run, and a winding device (8). The warp stop motion and a feeding-in device are designed as a constructional unit and either assigned to one subassembly or can be transferred from one subassembly to the other. The modular construction of the loom proves advantageous with regard to the design of the loom and its operation.

Series-shed loom, characterised in that a first frame 
(2), a weaving rotor (3) and an arrangement (4) for the 

cloth passage form a first subassembly (1), in that a 
second frame (6) and an arrangement (7) for the run of 

warp form a second subassembly (5), in that a winding 
apparatus (8) is provided and in that a plurality of 

warp stop motion devices and a warp laying-in device, 
each formed as a constructional unit (16, 18), are 

associated with one subassembly (1, 5) or are 
transferrable from one subassembly to the other (1, 5). 
Loom according to claim 1, characterised by a receiving 
means (57) for the warp laying-in unit (18), which is 

adjustably arranged on the first subassembly (1). 
Loom according to one of claims 1 or 2, characterised by 
a positioning means (52), which is joined to the 

receiving means (57) in order to shift the warp 
laying-in unit (18) between a take-over position and an 

operating position. 
Loom according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised by 
a holding means (51) for the warp laying-in unit, which 

is movable, with respect to the weaving rotor (3), 
between a first position for placing the warp laying-in 

unit (18) in readiness for the take-over into the 
receiving means (57) and a second position for placing 

the warp laying-in unit (18) in readiness for a change 
of article.  

 
Loom according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
warp thread stop motion unit (16) is arranged at the 

holding means (51) in such a manner that the warp thread 
stop motion unit (16) adopts the operating position in 

the first position and the article changing position in 
the second position. 
Loom according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
warp stop motion unit (16) is arranged in the first 

subassembly (1) and in that the holding means (51) is 
intended to move the warp stop motion unit (16) out of 

the operating position into the article changing 
position. 
Loom according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
holding means (51) is associated with the second 

subassembly (5). 
Loom according to claim 5, characterised in that the 
warp stop motion unit (16) is mounted in the second 

subassembly (5). 
Loom according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
positioning means (52) is mounted on the first 

subassembly (1). 
Loom according to claim 3, characterised in that the 
positioning means (52) is mounted on the second 

subassembly (5). 
Loom according to one of claims 9 or 10, characterised 
in that the positioning means (51) has a lever 

arrangement (59).  
 
Loom according to one of claims 9 to 11, characterised 
in that the positioning means has a drive means (58) 

chosen from the group comprising a working cylinder, an 
electric motor, an energy storing device etc. 
Loom according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
arrangement (4) for the cloth passage contains a cloth 

take-up device (12), a spreader bar (11) and a temple 
(10). 
Loom according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
arrangement (7) for the run of warp contains a whip roll 

(15), the warp stop motion unit (16), a deflection bar 
(17) and the warp laying-in unit (18).
