<ABSTRACT>
A spray nozzle operating on low air pressure is 
described comprising a nozzle (1) to which a fluid to be 

sprayed is fed as indicated by the arrows (2) and the 
flow of fluid is metered by a needle valve (3). 

Encircling the nozzle (1) is an air cap (4) along which 
air is fed, as indicated by the arrow (5) to atomise the 

fluid and transfer it onto the workpiece to be sprayed. 
The outward shape of the nozzle is configured with 
a taper (6) from the large outer diameter of the nozzle 

(1) at a steep angle and by a further taper (7) at a 
shallow angle to a small cylindrical tip (8) which 

projects slightly in front of the front face of the air 
cap (4). A concave radius (18) is formed between the 

taper (16) and the end face (17) measuring between 3 mm 
and 0.5 mm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved spray nozzle more particularly for spraying
fluids using high volume low pressure air.Nozzles designed for co-axial air-blast atomisers using high (>2.1 bar) pressure
compressed air are known. The outer surface of these nozzles taper from a large diameter
to a small diameter at a steep angle and a shallower one and end in a small parallel section.
An air cap fits over the nozzle in such a way that the air jet emitted sets up a region of
reduced pressure just in front of the nozzle. In some known designs the region of reduced
pressure is sufficient to draw up enough liquid to be atomised without the need for an
externally applied pressure feed. With this type of arrangement it is the high energy of the
emerging air jet that atomises the liquid jet to a degree fine enough for high quality spray
finishing.In the development of low pressure spraying equipment where the available
energy from the emerging jet is not so high, it has been found that the geometry of the
nozzle and air cap has to be improved in order to maintain a similar degree of atomisation.
A recently developed nozzle has just one taper angle on the nozzle without a parallel
section at the end. The cap bore (typically 6.2 mm) is considerably larger than that of the
high pressure nozzle (typically 3.1. mm).Another nozzle arrangement in which a tapered part of the nozzle is connected to
a right cylindrical part by a depression is shown in EP-A-0408786.The disadvantage of the low pressure nozzle is that instead of producing a region
of reduced pressure in front on the nozzle, the emerging jet produces a region of raised
pressure. This raised pressure often referred to as "back pressure" causes unwanted side
effects that detract from the ease of use and all-purpose suitability of the low pressure
nozzle.An aim of the present invention is to provide an improved spray nozzle operating
on low air pressure which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art constructions.According to the present invention there is provided a spray nozzle operating on
a low air pressure of less than 2.1 bar comprising a nozzle and an air cap with a central
aperture encircling the nozzle, characterised in that the nozzle tapers from its outside
diameter towards an end face perpendicular to the nozzle axis, and in which a concave 
radius between 3 mm and 0.5 mm extends from the taper to the end face so as to end at
tight angles thereto.The outer diameter of the end face is preferably between 1.0 mm and 3.5. mm.Conveniently, the
