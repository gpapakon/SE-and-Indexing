<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises at least one actuating shaft (A) comprising a drive motor (3), a drive shaft (7) connected to said motor and positioned between said drive motor (3) and said actuating shaft, a control circuit (29) for the motor (3), and a position sensor comprising a detector (19) and a generator (25) providing information representative of the movement and/or the position of said actuating shaft. The position sensor (19, 25) is fitted close to the motor at one end of the drive shaft (7), the generator (25) being driven by said drive shaft (7). Application particularly in controlling vehicle seats.

<CLAIMS>
Device for controlling the position of at least one shifting shaft
(A) of a vehicle seat mechanism, of the type comprising a driving motor

(3), a driving shaft (7) connected to said motor and interposed between said
driving motor (3) and said shifting shaft, a circuit (29, 46) for controlling

the motor (3) and a position sensor comprising a receiver (19) and a
generator of information (25) which represents the displacement and/or the

position of said shifting shaft, said position sensor (19, 25) being mounted
in proximity to the motor and adjacent to an end of the driving shaft (7) and

the generator (25) being mounted on and driven by said driving shaft (7),
characterized in that the position sensor (19, 25) and the electric

connections between the motor, the sensor and the control circuit are
housed in an interconnection box (1) which constitutes an interface between

the motor and the control circuit (29, 46), whereby the motor (3) axis, the
box (1) and the shifting shaft (A) are in alignment, and in that the driving

shaft (7) is disposed in a sheath (6) and constitutes a sheathed flexible shaft
(5).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the position
sensor (19, 25) employs the Hall-effect and comprises a generator

constituted by a magnet (25) having at least two poles.
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that a protective
case (22) is interposed between the magnet (25) and the receiver (19).
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that it further
comprises two diodes (51, 52) in opposition connected in the supply and

earth conductors (34, 36) of the motor, and the position sensor is supplied
through a signal conductor of said Hall-effect sensor.
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the supply and
signal conductor of the Hall-effect sensor is connected to a current-voltage

converter (47) which delivers the pulses of the Hall-effect sensor to a
microprocessor (44) which in particular counts and stores the pulses

delivered by said current-voltage converter. 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the number of
conductors between the control circuit and the interface is limited to merely

three (32, 48, 38).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the same
interconnection box (62) is associated with a plurality of shifting shafts of a

vehicle seat unit.
