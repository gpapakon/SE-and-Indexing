<ABSTRACT>
For the monitoring in particular of single-walled oil lines, a line monitoring device comprises an alarm unit for signalling a leak in the lines or a faulty functioning of the line monitoring device, a measuring device which establishes the leak and supplies a first control signal to the alarm unit, an essentially closed intermediate container for the liquid, to whose input opening a first line section, leading to the tank, and to whose output opening a second line section, leading to the consumer, are connected, and a vacuum pump whose suction connection is located in the space, remaining above the liquid level, in the intermediate container, which space is filled by an air blower, the measuring device being one for determining a pressure and/or volume state change of the air blower in the intermediate container and, as a function of the state of the air blower, supplying a second control signal to the vacuum pump for controlling counter to the state change.

Pipe monitoring device for fluid-carrying pipes leading from a tank (7) filled
with fluid (15) to a consumer (13, 65), with: an alarm unit for warning about

pipe leakages or a malfunction of the pipe monitoring device; a reading
device, which detects the leak and delivers an initial control signal to the

alarm unit (35); an essentially closed intermediate container (1) for the fluid
(15), which has a first pipe section (3) leading to the tank (7) at its input

opening, and a second pipe section (11) leading to the consumer (13, 65)
at its output opening; a valve (61) in the vicinity of the end turned towards

the tank of the first pipe section (3) and a vacuum pump (19), the suction
port of which is situated in the space above the fluid level filled by an air

pocket (17) of the intermediate container, whereby the reading device (21,
23) has the function of determining the pressure fluctuation and/or any

alteration in the volume of the air pocket (17) in the intermediate container
(1), which then, dependent on the situation of the air pocket (17), sends a

control signal to the vacuum pump (19) to counteract any volume alteration, 
characterized in that the valve in the vicinity of the end turned towards the

tank of the first pipe section (3) in the direction to the intermediate container
is a reduced-pressure valve (61), the closing force of which is on the one

hand greater than the pressure force in the direction of the intermediate
container created by the static pressure, which only arises as a result of the

level difference between the tank (7) and the intermediate container (1); and
is on the other hand lower than the pressure force in case of the pipe system

maximum suction capacity of the vacuum pump (19), created by the sum of
all statistic pressures occurring in the pipe system.

volume alteration, in particular according to claim 1, characterized in that the

reading device, in addition to a pressure sensor (21) which detects an
alteration in the pressure of the air pocket (17), also comprises a fluid level

sensor (23) which detects any alteration in the quantity of the fluid (15) in the
intermediate container (1).
Pipe monitoring device in accordance with claims 1 or 2, characterized in that
the reading device (21, 23) functions electronically and essentially with no

moving parts. 
Pipe monitoring device in accordance with claim 2, characterized in that the
fluid level sensor is a float gauge (43) which is connected to contact elements

(47, 49) via a lever arrangement (45) with the purpose of initiating the first
and second control signals, and by the fact that the pressure sensor is a

diaphragm switch (51), which exerts force, via the lever arrangement (45),
proportional to the pressure difference between the outer pressure and

reduced pressure in the intermediate container (1), on, and in the direction
of the buoyant force of the float gauge (43).

intermediate container (1).
Pipe monitoring device in accordance with claim 5 characterized in that the
pressure equalisation element is a second reduced-pressure valve (69), the

closing force of which is less than the pressure force arising from the pressure
difference between the outer pressure and reduced pressure in the
