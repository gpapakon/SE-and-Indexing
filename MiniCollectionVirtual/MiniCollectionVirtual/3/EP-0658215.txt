<ABSTRACT>
A process suitable for the extraction or recovery of metal values from arsenic containing feeds and including the steps of: a) treating the feed with a nitric acid-containing leachant solution in order to dissolve the desired metals; b) adding a source of iron (III) to the leachant solution whereby to oxidise arsenic (III) in solution to arsenic (V); c) adding a neutralising agent to the leachant solution whereby to precipitate arsenic as arsenic (V); d) separating the arsenic (V) precipitate from the leachant solution; and e) recovering metal values from the leachant solution.

<DESCRIPTION>
 EXTRACTION OR RECOVERY OF METAL VALUES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the extraction o recovery of metal values from feed materials and mor particularly to the extraction or recovery of metal value from feeds not amenable to efficient extraction b conventional methods.It is well known that many non-ferrous metal sulphid materials may be dissolved in nitric acid or other acidi solutions containing an oxidizing agent comprising dissolve oxides of nitrogen. A nitric acid-sulphuric acid mixture i one such acidic solution. Examples of such prior art includ European Patent Application 87310905.2 (Electrolytic Zin Company of Australasia Limited). This is typical of th known prior art in that it relates to the oxidative leachin of metal sulphides such as zinc sulphide concentrates.The known prior art is typically concerned with the treatment of copper- and zinc-containing sulphides. These feeds can be classed as non-refractory being relativel simple feeds to process. However, many feeds particularl those that are the intermediate products of other processes including hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical processes are- generally considered difficult to treat. With such difficult-to-treat feeds the dissolution of the valuable components may be inhibited, for example, by passivation. Accordingly they are not amenable to extraction or recovery by conventional methods such as direct treatment with aqueous solutions containing nitric acid or sulphuric acid.Therefore, it has hitherto been considered that in order to achieve acceptable dissolution rates with such feeds, some form of pre-treatment such as roasting is required. Such pre-treatment is costly in terms of both capital costs and operating costs, may cause the dissolution of undesirable components of the feed and may not yield complete dissolution of the desired metals. Alternatively, processing conditions may need to be extremely aggressive to achieve commercially viable rates of reaction. 

 Processing difficulties are compounded when the fee contains arsenic. Safe disposal of arsenic-containin residues is an important consideration. Many countries hav strict mandatory limits on the allowable arsenic levels o wastes from processing operations which are intended to b held in tailings dams or otherwise disposed of.One conventional method of processing arsenic-containin feeds is by ferric sulphate leaching. During processing o arsenic-containing feeds by ferric sulphate leaching, only portion of the arsenic (III) is generally
