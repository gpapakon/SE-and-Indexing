<DESCRIPTION>
The present inventors have already disclosed 
useful sulfonanilide compounds having anti-inflammatory, 
antipyretic, analgesic and anti-allergic actions as 
described in the specification of US patent No. 
4,885,367. For the purpose of providing compounds which 
have higher anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic 
and anti-allergic actions, the present inventors have 
synthesized various 5-aminosulfonanilide compounds, and 
have studied the pharmacological actions thereof. As a 
result, it has been found that 5-aminosulfonanilide 
compounds represented by Formula (I): 
(wherein R is a hydrogen atom, a formyl group, an acetyl 
group, a propionyl group, an n-butyryl group, an n-valeryl 
group, an ethoxyoxalyl group, an n-propoxyoxalyl  
 
group, a methoxycarbonylacetyl group or a 3-ethoxycarbonylpropionyl 
group) have potent anti-inflammatory, 
antipyretic, analgesic and anti-allergic actions, and 
thus the present invention has been accomplished. That 
is, the present invention is the compounds of Formula 
(I) useful as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic 
and anti-allergic agents. The compounds of Formula (I) of the present 
invention can be prepared, for example, by a method as 
shown below. 
(1) The compounds of Formula (I) wherein R is 
other than a hydrogen atom can be prepared from 2-fluoro-5-nitroaniline 
as a starting material as follows: 
  
 
(wherein R¹ is R other than a hydrogen atom). 
(a) First, the amino group of 2-fluoro-5-nitroaniline 
is sulfonylated by using methanesulfonyl 
chloride to give N-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide. 
This reaction may be preferably carried out in 
the presence of a base such as, for example, an 
inorganic base (e.g. lithium hydroxide, sodium 
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, 
potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or potassium 
bicarbonate), or an organic base (e.g. triethylamine, 
tri-n-butylamine, 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]-5-nonene, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-7-undecene, 
4-methylmorpholine, 1-methylpiperidine, 
pyridine or N,N-dimethylaminopyridine). Furthermore, this reaction is usually carried 
out in a solvent such as, for example, dichloromethane, 
chloroform, ethyl acetate, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, 
ethyl ether, benzene, toluene, xylene, acetone, 
acetonitrile, water, pyridine, N,N-dimethylformamide or 
dimethyl sulfoxide. (b) Then, N-(2-fluoro-5-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide 
and cyclohexanol are subjected to 
etherification in the presence of a base to give N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-5-nitrophenyl)methanesulfonamide.
