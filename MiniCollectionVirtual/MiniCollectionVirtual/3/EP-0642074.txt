<ABSTRACT>
A power management device (PMAN) is installed between a 
power supply and an electrical subcomponent of an electrical 

device. A predetermined signal characteristic from the 
electrical device to the subcomponent is constantly monitored 

by the PMAN. Based upon a status of the predetermined 
characteristic, power is provided by the power supply to the 

subcomponent. A timer provides at least one required signal. 
In one embodiment, the timer signals the device that the 

subcomponent is powered. In another embodiment, a timer 
signals a memory device to substitute output for the 

subcomponent while shutting off power to the subcomponent. 
The electrical device is not affected by the powering off of 

the subcomponent after an initial capture of the 
subcomponent's output. The electrical device operates the 

same with the PMAN as without the PMAN, therefore, little or 
no design changes are required to the existing device. The 

PMAN allows a highly distributed power usage management 
capability.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to power management, 
and in particular to a method and apparatus for managing 
power in portable computers to lengthen the life of the 
battery. The management and conservation of power are some of the 
fundamental issues in the design of hardware/electrical 
systems. In particular, with the advent of portable/laptop 
computers as well as many battery powered devices, the life 
of the battery used therein often determines the actual value 
of the device. For example, there would be little value in 
a portable laptop computer or a video camera that could only 
operate for five or ten minutes on a single battery charge. Therefore, it is advantageous to provide power 
management to these electronic devices in order to ensure 
that only the minimum amount of energy is used and only when 
needed. It is known in the art to provide electronic devices 
with monitoring systems to detect prolonged periods of 
inactivity. Upon the expiration of a predetermined amount of 
time with no activity, a monitoring system will shut the 
power off for the entire device. Such a monitoring system is 
of value in that power is not wasted by allowing the 
electronic device to remain on when there is no need for a 
power on condition. An example of such a device can be found 
in many battery powered calculators currently in use. In addition, there are power management systems which 
monitor various subcomponents of portable computers in order 
to ensure that only the currently required subcomponents are 
provided with power. These systems generally monitor demand 
for a given clock frequency, and power is shut off to a 
subcomponent when there is no demand therefrom. Power management can be conducted by hardware (such as 
a simple time delay switch), software or a combination of  
 
hardware and software. Regardless of how power is managed, 
it is generally managed on a centralized basis. Since 
electronic devices are made up of a plurality of components 
and/or circuits (including integrated circuits) it is 
desirable to provide power management to individual 
components and/or circuits. With such a decentralized power 
management, it would be possible to shut off individual 
components and/or circuits when not being utilized. Thus, 
even if the electronic device is being operated, power can be 
managed and saved by providing power only to those components 
that are required for operation. Thus, there is a need for 
a method and apparatus for providing a just in time, fine 
grain, flexible

management in an electrical subcomponent of an 

electrical device, comprising the steps of:
