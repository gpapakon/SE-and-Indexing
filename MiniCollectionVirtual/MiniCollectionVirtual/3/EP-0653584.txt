<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for removing piping from the ground comprises 
a cable (1) which has pipe engaging means (2) disposed 

along its length. The pipe engaging means (2) are arranged 
such that the cable (1) is insertable into a pipe (3) in one 

direction but that attempted withdrawal of the cable (1) in 
the opposite direction relative to the pipe (3) causes the 

pipe engaging means (2) to jam the cable (1) in the pipe 
(3). The pipe (3) can then be pulled from the ground, the 

pulling force being distributed along the length of the 
pipe (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for removing piping
from the ground, particularly, but not exclusively, lead or galvanised piping used in
water distribution systems.In the past lead piping has been used extensively in water distribution systems.
However, lead piping is no longer acceptable to such applications for health risk and
environmental reasons. There is now an EEC directive related to the lead content of
drinking water which will make it necessary to replace lead piping.Similarly, the corrosion of galvanised piping can present health risks and have
an adverse effect on the environment and thus replacement of such piping with plastic
piping is also desirable.Conventionally, lead pipes are extracted and replaced either by "trenching",
i.e. digging down to expose the pipe then cutting it out and replacing it with plastic
piping, or by "moling", i.e. using percussive moles to bore alongside the existing lead
pipes while dragging in replacement plastic pipes. A combination of both "trenching"
and "moling" can be used. Both of these methods of pipe removal/replacement have
disadvantages."Trenching" is time consuming, labour intensive and costly due to the
requirement of removal of extracted thoroughfare material and also of filling up the
trench (using stone etc.) to local authority requirements.Percussive moles are expensive pieces of equipment and also can be erratic
and consequently may track off the desired path and either surface where they are not
wanted, causing unwanted damage, or simply travel so far from the desired path that
the pipe removal replacement operation must be stopped until the mole is found and
dug out. "Moling" is thus a comparatively expensive operation and can involve time-consuming
and expensive downtime and surface damage repair. There is also a
possibility that when the mole veers off track it will damage other underground
services.There are also existing methods of pipe removal which involve coupling the
end of a cable to the pipe and dragging the pipe out of the ground using winch or other 
suitable machinery. A new pipe can be simultaneously dragged in position behind the 
old pipe. However, such existing methods have proved unsatisfactory. The cable is
coupled to the pipe either by clamping the end of the cable to the front end of the pipe
or by threading the cable through the pipe and clamping it to the rear end of the pipe.
With the former method, the pipe may simply break in the location of the coupling
under the strain of the pulling force

Apparatus for removing piping from the ground, comprising an elongate flexible
element (1;4;6;9;12;14) and pipe engaging means (2;5;7;8;10;11,13;15,16) disposed

along the length of the flexible element, the pipe engaging means
(2;5;7;8;10;11,13;15,16) and the flexible element (1;4;6;9;12;14) being insertable into a

pipe (2;5;7;8;13;15) in a first direction relative to the pipe (3) and being arranged such
that attempted withdrawal of the flexible element in the opposite direction to said first

direction causes pipe engaging members (2;5;7;8;13;15) of the pipe engaging means
(1;4;6;9;12;14) to engage the pipe and thereby prevent withdrawal of the flexible

element (1;4;6;9;12;14), characterised in that said pipe engaging members
(2;5;7;8;13;15) are adapted to be slidable against the surface of the pipe (3) as the

flexible element is inserted in said first direction, but such that upon attempted
withdrawal of the elongate element in said opposite direction friction generated between

the pipe engaging members (2;5;7;8;13;15) and the pipe (3) causes the pipe engaging
members to jam the flexible elements in the pipe.
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said pipe engaging members comprise
woven tubular sheaths (15) disposed along the length of the flexible element (14), each

sheath (15) having one end fixed to the flexible element (14) between the flexible
element (14) and a surrounding collar (16), the arrangement being such that attempted

withdrawal of the flexible element (14) from the pipe (3) in said opposite direction
causes each sheath (15) to bunch up ahead of a respective collar (16) and thereby jam

the flexible element (14) in the pipe (3).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said pipe engaging members comprise
barbs (2;5;7;8) which extend from the flexible element (1;4;6;9) at a plurality of

locations along its length, the arrangement being such that said barbs permit insertion of
the flexible element in said first direction but jam the flexible element in the pipe (3) if

withdrawal of the flexible element from the pipe is attempted in the opposite direction. 
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the flexible element is a multi-strand cable
(1) and the barbs (2) are bound into the cable (1) at a plurality of spaced apart locations

along the length thereof.
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the barbs comprise members (5) which are
fixed onto the flexible element (4) at spaced apart locations along its length.
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the flexible element is a multi-strand steel
cable (6) and the barbs comprise cable strands (7) which have free ends projecting

outwardly from the cable (6).
Apparatus according to claim 3, wherein the flexible element comprises a wire
(10) supporting steel strands (8), the wire being woven into the core of the flexible

element (9) such that the steel strands (8) protrude from the flexible element (9) to form
said barbs (8).
Apparatus according to claim 1, wherein said pipe engaging means comprises
cylindrical sleeves (11) fixed at spaced apart locations along the length of the flexible

element (12), and said pipe engaging members are coil springs (13) disposed around the
cable (12) between each adjacent pair of cylindrical sleeves (11), wherein each sleeve

(11) has an end tapering towards the cable (12) such that friction generated between
each coil spring (13) and the pipe (3) upon attempted withdrawal of the cable (12) from

the pipe (3) causes an end of each coil spring (13) to ride up the tapered end of a
respective sleeve (11) thereby forcing said end of each spring (13) radially outwards and

thereby jam the flexible element (12) in the pipe (3).
A method of removing piping from the ground using apparatus according to any
preceding claim, wherein the elongate flexible elem
ent and pipe engaging means are
first inserted into a pipe in a first direction, the flexible element is then pulled in the

opposite direction to said first direction so as to cause the pipe engaging means to jam 
the flexible element in the pipe, and the pipe is removed from the ground by further

pulling of the flexible element is said opposite direction.
A method according to claim 9, wherein the inserted end of the flexible element
is passed through the entire length of the pipe and is coupled to an end of a new pipe

which is to replace the pipe being removed so that the new pipe is drawn into position
by the flexible element as the old pipe is pulled from the ground.
