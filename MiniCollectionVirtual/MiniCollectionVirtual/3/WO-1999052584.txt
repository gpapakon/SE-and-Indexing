<ABSTRACT>
A catheter and introducer needle assembly (30) with needle shield (40) is provided wherein the needle (31) includes an enlarged diameter portion (38) and a distally facing shoulder (37). The needle shield (40) includes a means (60) for engaging the distally facing shoulder (37) to prevent unwanted distal movement of the needle (31) once the needle (31) has been withdrawn into the needle shield (40). The needle shield (40) also includes a small diameter opening adjacent to its proximal portion (43) to limit proximal movement of the needle (31) out of the needle shield (40).

 CATHETER AND INTRODUCER NEEDLE ASSEMBLY WITH NEEDLE SHIELDBackground of the InventionThe subject invention relates to a catheter and introducer needle assembly that includes a needle shield that will safely shield the sharp distal tip of the introducer needle after the needle has been used to insert the catheter into a patient.Catheters, particularly intravenous (IV) catheters, are used for infusing fluid, such as normal saline solution, various medicaments and total parenteral nutrition, into a patient or withdrawing blood from a patient. Peripheral IV catheters tend to be relatively short, and are on the order of about one and one- half inches in length. The most common type of IV catheter is an over the needle peripheral IV catheter. As its name implies, an over the needle catheter is mounted over an introducer needle having a sharp distal tip. The catheter and the introducer needle are assembled so that the distal tip of the introducer needle extends beyond the distal tip of the catheter with the bevel of the needle facing up away from the patient's skin.The catheter and introducer needle assembly is inserted at a shallow angle through the patient's skin into a peripheral blood vessel, i.e a smaller blood vessel that is not connected directly to the heart but is one of the branches of the central blood vessels that is directly connected to the heart. In order to verify proper placement of the assembly in the blood vessel, the clinician confirms that there is flashback of blood in the needle and in a flashback chamber located at the proximal end of the needle which is typically formed as part of the needle hub. Once proper placement is confirmed, the clinician applies pressure to the blood vessel by pressing down on the patient's skin over the distal tip of the introducer needle and the catheter. This finger pressure occludes further blood flow through the introducer needle. The clinician withdraws the introducer needle, leaving the catheter in place, and attaches a fluid handling device to the 

catheter hub. Once the introducer needle is withdrawn from the catheter, it is a "blood contaminated sharp" and must be properly handled.In recent years, there has been great concern over the contamination of clinicians with a patient's blood and a recognition that "blood contaminated sharps" must be immediately disposed. This concern has arisen because of the advent of currently incurable and fatal diseases, such as Acquired Immunosuppressive Deficiency Syndrome ("AIDS"), which can be transmitted by the

We Claim:
1. A catheter and introducer needle assembly, comprising: a catheter having a proximal end and distal end; a catheter hub in fluid communication with the catheter and having a proximal end and a distal end connected to the proximal end of the catheter; an introducer needle disposed in the catheter and having a proximal end and a distal end and defining an enlarged diameter portion with a distally facing shoulder; a needle shield having a proximal end and a distal end removably connected to the catheter hub, the needle shield defining a longitudinally extending passageway therethrough with the introducer needle extending through the longitudinally extending passageway wherein the longitudinally extending passageway has a means for engaging the enlarged diameter portion of the introducer needle to prevent unwanted proximal movement of the introducer needle and wherein the needle shield includes a means for engaging the distally facing shoulder to prevent unwanted distal movement of the introducer needle.
2. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 1 wherein the means for engaging the enlarged diameter portion of the introducer needle to prevent unwanted proximal movement of the introducer needle is an opening into a proximal portion of the longitudinally extending passageway that has a diameter smaller than the diameter of the enlarged diameter portion of the introducer needle.
3. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 2 wherein the means for engaging the distally facing shoulder to prevent unwanted distal movement of the introducer needle is a latch that is slidable along the introducer needle so as to be proximal of the enlarged diameter portion when the distal end of the introducer needle is distal of the distal end of the needle shield and distal
13 


of the enlarged diameter portion to allow the latch to engage the distally facing shoulder after the distal end of the introducer needle is withdrawn into the needle shield.
4. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 3 wherein the latch has a generally U shaped gate and a biasing mechanism to bias the U shaped gate toward the introducer needle.
5. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 3 wherein the latch is a tube defining at least one inwardly directed tab.
6. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 3 wherein the latch is a leaf spring having one leg biased toward the introducer needle for engagement with the distally facing shoulder.
7. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 6 wherein the leg is contoured along its proximal portion to approximate a portion of the circumference of the introducer needle.
8. A needle shield assembly, comprising: a needle having a proximal end and a distal end and defining an enlarged diameter portion and a distally facing shoulder; and a needle shield defining a longitudinally extending passageway therethrough with the needle extending through the longitudinally extending passageway wherein the longitudinally extending passageway has a proximal portion with a diameter less than the diameter of the enlarged diameter portion and wherein the needle shield includes a means for engaging the distally facing shoulder.
9. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 8 wherein the means for engaging the distally facing shoulder is a latch that is slidable
14 


along the needle so as to be proximal of the enlarged diameter portion when the distal end of the needle is distal of the distal end of the needle shield and distal of the enlarged diameter portion to allow the latch to engage the distally facing shoulder after the distal end of the needle is withdrawn into the needle shield.
10. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 9 wherein the latch has a generally U shaped gate and a biasing mechanism to bias the U shaped gate toward the introducer needle.
11. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 9 wherein the latch is a tube defining at least one inwardly directed tab.
12. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 9 wherein the latch is a leaf spring having one leg biased toward the introducer needle for engagement with the distally facing shoulder.
13. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 12 wherein the leg is contoured along its proximal portion to approximate a portion of the circumference of the introducer needle.
14. A needle shield assembly, comprising: a needle having a proximal end and a distal end and defining an enlarged diameter portion thereon with a distally facing shoulder; and a needle shield defining a longitudinally extending passageway through which the needle extends, the needle shield having a proximal end and a distal end; a latch operatively connected to the needle shield and slidable along the needle so as to be proximal of the enlarged diameter portion when the distal end of the needle is distal of the distal end of the needle shield and distal of the enlarged diameter portion to allow the latch to engage the distally facing shoulder after the distal end of the needle is withdrawn into the needle shield.

15. The needle shield assembly of claim 14 wherein the latch has a generally U shaped gate and a biasing mechanism to bias the U shaped gate toward the introducer needle.
16. The needle shield assembly of claim 14 wherein the latch is a tube defining at least one inwardly directed tab.
17. The needle shield assembly of claim 14 wherein the latch is a leaf spring having one leg biased toward the introducer needle for engagement with the distally facing shoulder.
18. The catheter and introducer needle assembly of claim 17 wherein the leg is contoured along its proximal portion to approximate a portion of the circumference of the introducer needle.
