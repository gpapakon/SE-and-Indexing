<ABSTRACT>
Methods for preparing and applying superspreading agricultural sprays without undue foaming of the spray mixture employ a superspread-promoting, low-foaming trisiloxane surfactant. Agricultural spray mixtures with superspread properties, but limited foaming, comprise (A) a superspreading, low-foaming trisiloxane surfactant and (B) an agricultural chemical spray mixture comprising water, an agricultural chemical (e.g., a pesticide), and optionally an organic surfactant, antifoam agent, and an organic solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to agricultural, e.g. pesticide, spray mixtures. More
particularly, this invention relates to agricultural spray
mixtures characterized by superspreading with low foaming.Spray mixtures are treated with trisiloxane silicone surfactants which
impart superspreading and yet exhibit low foaming, a combination of properties
not previously available.Pesticide Science, Vol. 38 / 2&3, 1993 pages 103-122,
reports the uses and properties of organosilicone compounds as
surfactants in agrochemical formulations. The paper, which is a
transcript of papers given at the Third Internartional
Symposium on Adjuvants for Agrochemicals, held at Churchill
College, Cambridge on 3-7 August 1992, is mostly concerned with
Silwet L-77 which is used in many agricultural spray
formulations. This organosilicone surfactant is an excellent
wetting agent which has superspreading properties.Agricultural spray mixtures can be in the form of solutions, emulsions,
suspensions and dispersions, and are used in agriculture for applying
agricultural chemicals which can be formed into one of the noted types of
mixtures for application to plants, soil and insects. Among the typical
agricultural chemicals are pesticides such as herbicides, insecticides, 
fungicides, growth regulators, and nutrients and micronutrients to plants and
insects. They typically contain surfactants to enhance spreading when applied.
When prepared with conventional surfactants, foaming often impedes mixing
and creates problems even before the mixture is completely formed. Once
formed, agricultural spray mixtures can foam and overflow containment vessels
when transported, pumped, or subjected to motion such as vibration. Such
spillage can result in loss of the agricultural spray mixture and in the
contamination of surfaces by potentially toxic substances as well as losses of
time and money.Conventional trisiloxane surfactants have the ability to impart the property
of superspreading to agricultural spray mixtures. By "superspreading" is meant
the ability of a drop of the mixture to spread to a diameter at least 9 times as
great as a doubly-distilled drop of water on a hydrophobic surface such as the
leaf of a plant. However, the conventional use of trisiloxane surfactants for
superspreading typically increases mixture foaming relative to the mixture in the
absence of the trisiloxane surfactant.There is a need to prevent a superspreading agricultural spray mixture
from foaming or overflowing its containment vessel while not adversely affecting
