<ABSTRACT>
An internal anterior fixation system (10) for treatment of vertebral burst fractures includes an elongated plate (11) which includes integral superior (12), inferior (20) and bridge portions (25). The superior (12) and inferior (20) portions are provided for fixation to corresponding vertebrae while the bridge portion (25) spans between the portions over the affected vertebra. The superior portion (12) includes a pair of generally parallel elongated slots (15) therethrough each having scallops (40, 42) for receiving a bone fixation screw (22). The inferior portion (20) includes a pair of openings (21) through which fixation screws or bolts extend. The slots (15) in the superior portion (12) allow for compression or distraction of the intermediate vertebral region. The openings (21) in the inferior portion (20) are oriented at an oblique angle (A) relative to the axis of the plate to provide a quadrilateral fixation construct. The bridge portion (25) has a width (W) significantly less than the width of the superior and inferior fixation portions.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ANTERIOR THORACOLUMBAR PLATEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention concerns devices for the anterior fixation of the spine. In particular, the present invention relates to a plate for the fixation of thoracic or lumbar vertebra. The plate of the present invention has particular application in situations where vertebral body corpectomies are performed, such as burst fractures with significant spinal canal compromise or vertebral body tumors. Fractures of the spine commonly occur at the thoracolumbar junction, and particular in the T-ll, T-12, L-1 or L-2 vertebrae. In the past, treatment of burst fractures involved prolonged bed rest in a body cast and/or a brace. Harrington rods were the first widely successful devices implementing internal fixation for treatment of a vertebral burst fracture. The Harrington rods involved posterior distraction of the spine and allowed some reduction and restoration of vertebral height by means of distraction. However, the inability of Harrington rods to reduce a kyphosis or to clear the spinal canal completely were major disadvantages of this approach.To improve reduction, posterior distraction systems were modified with the use of contoured rods, sleeves for the rods, improved hooks and sublaminar wires. However, with these posterior distraction systems, it was usually recommended that the spinal fusion include 2 vertebral levels caudad to the fracture and 2 or 3 levels cephalad to the fracture. The posterior approach, even to this level of advancement, was still less than an optimum solution to the problem of treatment of thoracolumbar burst fractures. 

 In the early 1980's an anterior approach was developed for treatment of burst fractures. Improved scanning techniques allowed visualization of bone fragments that were present with burst fractures, so that attention could then be directed toward complete decompression of the canal as a way to provide the best environment for neurological recovery. Various fixation devices have been developed since that time based upon this theory of internal anterior treatment of burst fractures. However, the anterior approach has in some cases lead to increased operative morbidity due to the very difficult nature of the procedure. In addition risk to the vascular network as well as complete clearance of the spinal canal has been a problem with many of the anterior fixation approaches. Most of the prior internal anterior systems suffer from a great degree of complexity.One such system is the Kanada device marketed by

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. An internal anterior fixation system for treatment of vertebral burst fractures, comprising: an elongated plate having longitudinal axis and including a superior portion, an inferior portion and a bridge portion integrally spanning between said superior and inferior portions, said superior portion defining a pair of elongated slots therethrough each having a longitudinal axis generally parallel to said longitudinal axis of said plate, said inferior portion defining a pair of openings therethrough; and vertebral fixation elements having a bone engaging portion and a plate engaging portion adapted to extend through either of said slots or said openings in said plate for engaging said plate.
2. The internal anterior fixation system of claim 1, wherein said pair of openings in said inferior portion each includes a centroid defining a line therebetween, said line defining an oblique angle relative to said longitudinal axis of said plate.
3. The internal anterior fixation system of claim 1, wherein said superior portion and said inferior portion each have a width, and said bridge portion has a width substantially less than the width of said superior and inferior portions.
4. The internal anterior fixation system of claim 1, wherein said pair of elongated slots are arranged such that the longitudinal axes of said slots are mutually parallel.
5. The internal anterior fixation system of claim 4, wherein said bridge portion has a width less than the width of either of said superior and said inferior portions, and 


generally equal to the distance between the longitudinal axes of said slots.
6. The internal anterior fixation system of claim 1, wherein said plate includes a number of scallops defined in the upper surface of said plate about the perimeter of each of said elongated slots.
7. The internal anterior fixation system of claim 66 wherein said plate includes a number of scallops defined in the lower surface of said plate about the perimeter of each of said elongated slots.
