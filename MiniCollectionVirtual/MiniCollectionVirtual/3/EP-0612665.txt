<ABSTRACT>
A hollow stackable product (30) including at least a section of a 
generally conically contoured sidewall (32) having a number of longitudinal 

folds (34) of alternating ridges (36) and furrows (38). Each fold includes a first 
side strip (40) laterally extending from the top of a ridge to the bottom of an adjacent 

furrow and a second side strip (42) laterally extending from the bottom of 
the furrow to the top of the next adjacent ridge. The first side strip has a different 

lateral orientation than the second side strip. The first side strip has a 
greater wall thickness than the second side strip; and the first side strip also 

has a shorter lateral extent than the second side strip. When the product is 
stacked within a like product, a first product is placed inside a second like 

product so that the first side strips of the first product are positioned closely 
adjacent the first side strips of the second product and the second side strips of 

the first product are positioned closely adjacent the second side strips of the 
second product. Accordingly such products have a minimal stacking height.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally pertains to the stackability of hollow 
products and is particularly directed to an improvement in the stackability of 
hollow products of the type that includes at least a section of a generally conically 
contoured sidewall having a varying wall thickness and a number of longitudinal 
folds of alternating ridges and furrows. The longitudinal folds enhance 
the stiffness of such hollow stackable products and the variation in wall 
thickness may reduce the required injection pressure and clamp force when the 
product is manufactured by an injection molding process. A prior art product of this type, as described in U.S. Patent No. 
3,194,468, is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, which show three cups 10 stacked 
together with one cup stacked within a second cup which is stacked within a 
third cup. Each cup 10 has a generally conically contoured sidewall 12 having 
a number of longitudinal folds 14 of alternating ridges 16 and furrows 18. 
Each fold 14 includes a first side strip 20 laterally extending from the top of a 
ridge 16 to the bottom of an adjacent furrow 18 and a second side strip 22 
laterally extending from the bottom of the furrow 18 to the top of the next adjacent 
ridge 16. The first side strips 20 have a different lateral orientation than 
the second side strips 22. The wall thickness at the bottom of the furrows 18 is 
greater than the wall thickness of the first and second side strips 20, 22. When the cups 10 are stacked within one another, as shown in 
Figures 1 and 2, the cups 10 contact each other at the furrows 18, which have 
the greater wall thickness, such that there is a substantial space 24 between 
the first side strips 20 and/or between the second side strips 22 of the adjacent 
cups 10. Consequently, the stacking height of the cups 10 is greater than it 
would be if there was not a substantial space 24 between the first side strips 20 
and/or between the second side strips 22 of the adjacent stacked cups 10. The  
 
stacking height of a product is the difference in height between the top of the 
product when stacked within a like product and the top of the like product. 
The stacking height of a product is approximately inversely proportional to the 
quantity of the product that can be stacked within a container of a given size. The present invention provides a hollow stackable product including 
at least a section of a generally conically contoured sidewall having a number of 
longitudinal folds of alternating ridges and furrows, wherein each

<CLAIMS>
A hollow stackable product (30), comprising at least a section of a 
generally conically contoured sidewall (32) having a number of longitudinal 

folds (34) of alternating ridges (36) and furrows (38), each fold including 

a first side strip (40) laterally extending from the top of a said ridge 
(36) to the bottom of a said furrow (38); and 
a second side strip (42) laterally extending from the bottom of the said 
furrow (38) to the top of a said ridge (36) next to the said ridge; 
 
   wherein the first side strip (40) has a different lateral orientation than 

the second side strip (42);
 
   wherein the first side strip (40) has a greater wall thickness than the 

second side strip (42); and
 
   wherein when a first said product of two like said products is placed in 

the second said product, a said first side strip (40) of the first product may be 
positioned closely adjacent a said first side strip of the second product and a 

said second side strip (42) of the first product may be positioned closely adjacent 
a said second side strip of the second product. 
A product according to claim 1, wherein the first side strip (40) has 
a shorter lateral extent than the second side strip (42).  

 
A stack of at least two like products (30), each product comprising 
at least a section of a generally conically contoured sidewall (32) having a number 

of longitudinal folds (34) of alternating ridges (36) and furrows (38), each 
fold including 


a first side strip (40) laterally extending from the top of a said ridge 
(36) to the bottom of a said furrow (38); and 
a second side strip (42) laterally extending from the bottom of the said 
furrow (38) to the top of a said ridge (36) next to the said ridge; 
 
   wherein the first side strip (40) has a different lateral orientation than 

the second side strip (42); and
 
   wherein the first side strip (40) has a greater wall thickness than the 

second side strip (42); and
 
   wherein a first product (30) of said like products is disposed in a 

second product (30) of said like products; and
 
   wherein a said first side strip (40) of the first product (30) is positioned 

closely adjacent a said first side strip of the second product and a said second 
side strip (42) of the first product is positioned closely adjacent a said second 

side strip of the second product. 
A stack of products (30) according to claim 3, wherein the first side 
strip (40) has a shorter lateral extent than the second side strip (42).
