<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for forming cigarette blocks consisting of three rows of cigarettes (3), the middle row containing one cigarette (3) less than the other rows, with shafts (2) which are formed by shaft walls (4) arranged at a distance from one another and the number of which corresponds to the maximum number, plus one, of cigarettes (3) in the rows, and with a width somewhat larger than the cigarette diameter, for the reception of cigarettes (3) arranged one above the other, and with a block slide (6) for simultaneously pushing a number of rows of cigarettes (3) necessary for forming each cigarette block out of the lower extraction region of the shafts (2), located above a shaft bottom (5), into a block receptacle (7). At the same time, in the extraction region, the shafts (2) extend at such an inclination to the shaft bottom (5) and, in the position of the two lower rows, an outer shaft (2') is closed in such a way that the lower three rows of cigarettes (3) are arranged offset to one another essentially according to their arrangement in the subsequent cigarette block.

Apparatus for the formation of cigarette blocks 
consisting of three rows of cigarettes (3), the middle 

row containing one cigarette (3) less than the other 
rows, with shafts (2) which are formed by shaft walls (4) 

arranged spaced from one another and which are of a 
number corresponding to the maximum number of cigarettes 

(3) in the rows increased by one and have a width somewhat 
larger than the cigarette diameter, for the 

reception of cigarettes (3) arranged one above the other, 
and with a block slide (6) for simultaneously pushing a 

number of rows of cigarettes (3) necessary for forming a 
respective cigarette block out of the lower extraction 

region of the shafts (2), located above a shaft bottom 
(5), into a block receptacle (7), the shafts (2) 

extending obliquely in the extraction region relative to 
the shaft bottom (5) in such a way and an outer shaft 

(2') in the position of the two lower rows is so closed 
that the lower three rows of cigarettes (3) are already 

arranged offset relative to one another essentially 
according to their offset arrangement in the subsequent 

cigarette block, characterized in that the block 
receptacle (7) is stationary and narrows laterally on the 

exit side to form a cell (14) of a block-conveying device 
(15), in such a way that the cigarette block guided 

through by the block slide (6) is compressed, the cell 
(14) being designed to narrow further relative to the 

block receptacle (7), and the middle shaft walls (4) 
extending partially into the narrowing region of the 

block receptacle (7).  
 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in the extraction region, the shaft walls (4) are 

separated from a conical portion (4') located above them. 
Apparatus according to Claims 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the shaft walls (4) terminate short 

of the shaft bottom (5). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the upper ends of the shaft walls 

(4), having vibrating rollers (21) located above them, 
are arranged offset in height relative to one another.
