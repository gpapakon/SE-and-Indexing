<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ultrafine 
particle of quasi-crystalline aluminum alloy and a 
process for producing an aggregate thereof. As used herein, the term "quasi-crystalline 
aluminum alloy" generally means an aluminum alloy having 
a symmetry in five rotations, which is not present in a 
usual crystal, and also having a regular 20-hedral 
structure, i.e., having a structure intermediate between 
a crystalline aluminum alloy and an amorphous aluminum 
alloy. The quasi-crystalline aluminum alloys include 
those having a metastable phase and those having a 
stable phase. The quasi-crystalline aluminum alloy 
having the metastable phase is phase-transformed at a 
crystallization temperature Tx into a crystalline phase 
which is a stable phase, while the quasi-crystalline 
aluminum alloy in the form of the stable phase is 
maintained stably at a quasi-crystalline structure up to 
its melting point. The quasi-crystalline aluminum alloy has been 
conventionally produced by either a liquid quenching 
process employing a single roller melt spinning 
technique, or a mechanical alloying process.  When the quasi-crystalline aluminum alloy is used 
as a catalyst material, a magnetic material or the like, 
it is necessary to form the quasi-crystalline aluminum 
alloy into extremely fine particles in order to enhance 
its properties. By the liquid quenching process, however, the 
quasi-crystalline aluminum alloy is of a ribbon shape 
and hence, even if it is pulverized, the resulting 
particles have a diameter of 1 to 10 µm or more. On the 
other hand, even with the mechanical alloying process, 
particles having a particle size of micro-order are only 
produced. Therefore, the particles of quasi-crystalline 
aluminum alloy produced in the prior art processes 
cannot possibly meet the demand for an extreme reduction 
in particle size. It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a process for producing ultrafine particles of quasi-crystalline 
aluminum alloy and an aggregate thereof, 
which are most suitable for a catalyst material, a 
magnetic material or the like. To achieve the above object, according to the 
present invention, there is provided ultrafine particles 
of a quasi-crystalline aluminum alloy, which consists of 
palladium (Pd) in an amount represented by 20 atomic % 
≦ Pd ≦ 30 atomic %, and the balance of aluminum. Such 
Al-Pd based quasi-crystalline aluminum alloy ultrafine 
particles are effective for use as a catalyst material,  
 
because they have a specific surface area
