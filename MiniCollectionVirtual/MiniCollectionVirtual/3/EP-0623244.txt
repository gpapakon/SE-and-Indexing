<ABSTRACT>
A transistor comprising an AlxGa1-xAs (or AlxIn1-xAs) layer and a GayIn1-yAs layer defining, at the latter layer, a quantum well having HH-type sub-bands. The thickness of the GayIn1-yAs layer is selected so that when a negative voltage (VG) is applied to the gate, sub-bands HH1, HH2, HH3,... occur in the quantum well and are separated by sufficient energy to ensure that the sub-bands corresponding to the highest effective masses M*h// have a substantially lower hole density than sub-band HH1, whereby a hole build-up condition is created in the quantum well and the transconductance of the component is correlatively increased. This corresponds to a GayIn1-yAs thickness of about 4-6 nm for 25-35 % indium, or 6-9 nm for 25-30 % indium. In order to further improve performance, a ternary structure such as AlxGa1-xAs/GayIn1-yAs/AlzGa1-zAs, AlxGa1-xAs/GaAswSb1-w/AlzGa1-zAs or AlxGa1-xAs/GayIn1-yAswSb1-w/AlzGa1-zAs may also be provided.
