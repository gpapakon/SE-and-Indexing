<ABSTRACT>
The coupling system uses a carrier (3) with a support surface for the edge emitting laser (1), the monitoring diode (9) mounted on the same side of the carrier so that it projects over a recess (5) formed in the carrier surface into which part of the laser light emitted by the laser is directed. The walls of the recess are mirror coated so that the laser light is deflected onto the light reception surface of the monitoring diode. Pref. the carrier has a further recess (4) on the opposite side of the laser to the monitoring diode containing an optical imaging element (8).

Arrangement for coupling an optoelectronic 
reception element to an optoelectronic transmission 

element, in particular a monitor diode to an edge-emitting 
laser, the reception element (9) being mounted 

on the upper side (2) of a support (3) and the light-sensitive 
surface of the reception element (9) facing the 

upper side (2) and at least one optical deflection 
component being situated on the support (3), the transmission 

element (1) being mounted on the upper side (2) 
of the support (3), the support (3) having a first 

indentation (5) on the upper side (2), the transmission 
element (1) being fitted in such a way that the light 

bundle (7) emitted by a first edge propagates at least 
partly into the indentation (5), the reception element 

(9) extending over the indentation (5), the walls of the 
indentation (5) being zonally mirrored and the light 

bundle (7) emitted by the transmission element (1) being 
partially reflected from the walls of the indentation (5) 

and incident on the light-sensitive face of the reception 
element (9). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the support (3) has a further indentation (4) on 

the upper side (2), in that the transmission element (1) 
is fitted in such a way that the light bundle (6) emitted 

by the second edge propagates partly into the further 
indentation (4) and in that further optical elements are 

fitted in the further indentation (4). 
Arrangement according to Claim 2, characterized 
in that imaging optics (8) are provided in the further  

 
indentation (4). 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the support (3) consists of monocrystalline 

silicon and the indentations (4, 5) are 
produced by anisotropic etching. 
Arrangement according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the indentations (4, 5) are produced 

by embossing in suitable materials.
