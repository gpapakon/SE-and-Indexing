<ABSTRACT>
A wire printhead comprising a plurality of radially distributed 
electromagnets (4) and a corresponding plurality of armatures, each 

provided with an actuator arm (25,26) forming, with the juxtaposed 
armature to an electromagnet, a lever of first order for actuating an 

impression wire (19,20) attached to a free end (23,24) of the actuator 
arm, said lever being biased to the rest position by a flexibly 

pre-loaded leaf spring (45,46) acting on the lever in a predetermined 
position with respect to the lever fulcrum, through a resilient element 

(41) which defines the point of application to the lever (25,26) of the 
force from the leaf spring (45,46). The leaf springs are interconnected 

by a ring shaped cage (27). This cage is axially makable between two 
positions by means of a rotational movement of a plate (62). In this way 

the electromagnet air gaps and hence the wire stroke length can be 
adjusted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a wire printhead of 
the kind used in dot matrix impact printers employed as 
peripheral printer units in data processing systems and 
personal calculators or PCs. Known are wire printheads wherein a plurality 
of moving electromagnet armatures are each provided 
with an actuator arm whose end is coupled to a printing 
element in wire form. The several armatures are generally arranged 
to lie in one plane and extend radially around a 
perpendicular axis to said plane, with the actuator 
arms being terminated the closest possible to said 
axis. This axis is by universal convention agreed 
to be the head axis. The print wires generally extend along said 
axis direction and are given the least possible amount 
of curvature and run to a single print wire with their 
remote ends from the actuator arms. The print wires may each be joined as by 
soldering or welding, to one actuator arm, into an 
arm/wire unit, or may be coupled dynamically thereto. In that case, the wire end joined to the 
actuator arm is provided with a head acting as an  
 
abutment member for a compression spring being wound 
around the wire end to bias the head and wire toward 
the actuator arm. See for instance EP-A-0 418 433. Additionally to biasing the wire toward the 
actuator arm, the compression spring acts as a 
mechanical polarization member for the armature by 
constraining it to a rest position with a predetermined 
force, easy to control. The armature is moved from the rest position 
to an active position by the energization of an 
associated electromagnet. The actuator arm/wire unitary construction is 
to be preferred because it reduces the number of the 
printhead parts, simplifies the assembly operations, 
and enables the actuator arms to be best clustered 
together so as to minimize the wire bending, and 
eventually the wire lengths. The net result is a highly compact printhead 
design. The tradeoff of the unitary actuator arm/wire 
construction is that, absent the action from the 
compression spring ensuring the arm-to-wire dynamic 
coupling, a mechanical polarization must be provided 
for the armatures in order to retain them in the rest 
position.  
 In the instance of printheads wherein the 
armatures and associated arms form, in combination with 
the electromagnets associated therewith, levers FPR of 
third order, the mechanical polarization of the 
armatures can be readily implemented by constructing 
the fulcrum as a joint having predetermined rigidity. Thus, armature release printheads
