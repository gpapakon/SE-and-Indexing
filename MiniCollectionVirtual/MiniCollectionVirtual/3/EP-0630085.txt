<ABSTRACT>
In a semiconductor light emitting device of a group II-V
semiconductor, a current shutting-off layer (6, 16) for passing

the current only through a belt-shaped central area (6a) is
formed in one of the two light shutting-up layers (5, 7, 15, 17)

sandwiching an active layer (4, 14), so that the light emission
efficiency improves and a light guiding path is provided. In a

process for forming each layer on a substrate through epitaxial
growth, the belt-shaped central area (6a) is formed by etching

the current shutting-off layer (6, 16).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor light
emitting device and its manufacturing method, said light
emitting device being suitable for use as a semiconductor laser device, as
a signal reading and writing light emitting device for use in a
compact disk (CD) player and a laser disk (LD) player, as a
light emitting device for use in a bar code reader, and as a
blue light emitting device (LED) for use in displays of other
various electronic apparatuses.Fig. 1 shows a blue light emitting semiconductor layer
device of ZnSe as an example of a conventional semiconductor
light emitting device. In the semiconductor laser device shown
in this figure, a group II-VI semiconductor of ZnCdSSe or
MgZnCdSSe is grown on an N-type GaAs substrate 21, and a buffer
layer 22 made of N-type ZnSe, a light shutting-up layer 23 made
of N-type ZnSSe, an active layer 24 made of ZnCdSe, a light
shutting-up layer 25 made of P-type ZnSSe and an electrode
contact layer 26 made of P-type ZnSe are formed in this order in
lamination.On the electrode contact layer 26 which is the top layer,
a metal such as Au is directly deposited to form an electrode
27. Similarly, an electrode 28 is formed on the outer surface
of the N-type substrate 21. The light shutting-up layers 23 and 
25 made of N-type and P-type ZnSSe, respectively, function to
prevent the diffusion of light caused at the active layer 24.In an device having such a P-N junction structure of the
group II-VI semiconductor, when a bias voltage is applied
between the electrodes 27 and 28 in a forward direction,
carriers injected by the current are shut up in the active layer
24, so that an induced emission occurs vigorously. When the
exciting current exceeds a threshold value, light resonates
between the parallel end surfaces of the active layer 24 to
cause a laser oscillation. In this case, to improve the output
performance of the device, it is important to increase the ratio
of the current which contributes to the light emission.That is, since the light emitting area of the active layer
24 is limited to a belt-shaped central light emitting area 24a,
to increase the ratio of the current which contributes to the
light emission, it is desirable to limit the spread of the
current in a horizontal direction (direction parallel to the
active layer 24) to shut up as much current as possible in the
central light emitting area 24a of the active layer 24.In a conventional device, the current is shut up in the
following manner: In forming the electrode 27 on the P-type
buffer layer
