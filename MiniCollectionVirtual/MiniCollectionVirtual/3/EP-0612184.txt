<ABSTRACT>
A display apparatus wherein the light transmittance 
of a pixel selected by a scanning electrode and a data 

electrode is changed in response to the difference of 
voltages applied to the scanning electrode and the data 

electrode, which comprises a display panel having a 
plurality of scanning electrodes and a plurality of data 

electrodes, a scanning voltage generator for applying a 
scanning voltage to the scanning electrodes of the 

display panel by receiving a scanning signal, a data 
voltage generator for applying a data voltage to the data 

electrodes of the display panel by receiving a data 
signal, an orthogonal function generator for generating 

an orthogonal function signal having substantially 
orthogonality, and a data signal forming circuit for 

operating the data signal based on a predetermined video 
signal and the orthogonal function signal generated from 

the orthogonal function generator, wherein the data 

signal forming circuit includes a field video signal 
converter for distributing signals for a single picture 

to those for a plurality of sub-pictures, and an 
orthogonal conversion signal generator for effecting 

orthogonal conversion of an input signal by the 
orthogonal function signal generated from the orthogonal 

function generator, the field video signal converter and 
the orthogonal conversion signal generator being 

connected in series, and a correction signal generator  
 

for generating a correction signal to be included in the 
data signal so that an effective voltage applied to a 

pixel in a non-selection time is substantially constant 
to any pixel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates mainly to a display
apparatus having a matrix arrangement. Particularly, the
present invention relates to a passive matrix display
apparatus of a type that light transmittance is rapidly
changed when a voltage applied to the intersection of a
lateral electrode and a longitudinal electrode, i.e. a
row electrode and a column electrode of a matrix exceeds
a threshold value.A conventional technique will be described with
reference to a liquid crystal display apparatus wherein a
signal electrode and a scanning electrode are
respectively referred to as a column electrode and a row
electrode. In a passive matrix type liquid crystal
display apparatus comprising an Nr number of row
electrodes and an Mc number of column electrodes, a so-called
successive line scanning method has been used to
drive it. Namely, a group of pixel signals corresponding
to pixels on an arbitrary line of row electrodes is 
applied to column electrodes, and at the same time, a
column electrode selective voltage is applied to each row
electrode. Thus, the light transmittance of each pixel
selected by the application of the row electrode
selective voltage is changed. The above-mentioned
operation is effected to scan the Nr number of row
electrodes for each row electrode.In the liquid crystal display apparatus, the light
transmittance of a pixel has a threshold characteristic
which relies on the effective value of a voltage applied
to the pixel. In the above-mentioned driving method, it
has been known that the condition to obtain the ratio of
the maximum and minimum values of light transmittance,
i.e. the largest contrast ratio can be expressed by
formula (1) (reference document: Scanning Limitations of
Liquid-Crystal-Displays, IEEE Transactions on Electron
Devices, vol. ED-21, No. 2, February 1974, pp146-155 by
Paul M. Alt, Peter Pleshko):
Vr/Vc = Nr1/2Under the condition of the formula (1), the ratio of
the effective value Von of a pixel voltage which provides
the maximum (or the minimum) light transmittance to the
effective value Voff of the pixel voltage which provides
the minimum (or the maximum) transmittance is expressed
by formula (2).
Von/Voff = ((Nr1/2-1)/(Nr1/2+1))1/2Further, Voff is given by formula (3). 
Voff = Vc(2(Nr-Nr1/2)/Nr2)1/2From the formulas (1) and (3), formula (4) is
obtained.
Vr = Voff[Nr/(2(1-1/Nr1/2))1/2]1/2= Vth[Nr/(2(1-1/Nr1/2))1/2]1/2The value Voff is generally set to a threshold value
Vth of transmittance vs effective value characteristics.
Accordingly, the values Vc and Vr are
