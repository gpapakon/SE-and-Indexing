<ABSTRACT>
A method for processing picture signals in which analog 
picture signals are converted into digital picture signals 

which are written as digital picture signals in a field 
memory, and in which the digital picture signals read from 

the field memory are converted into analog signals which are 
routed to a display device for display, wherein a write 

address initializing pulse having its timing changed 
depending on a difference in the stationary phase error of 

the analog picture signals in a line lock PLL circuit 
synchronized with the horizontal synchronizing signals of 

the analog picture signals which is associated with 
the television systems is supplied to the field memory, with 

the relation of association between the digital picture 
signals and the write start address in the field memory 

being changed in association with the television systems.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for processing picture
signals for a variety of television systems, a picture signal
processing apparatus for carrying out the picture signal
processing method, and a television apparatus provided with the
picture signal processing apparatus for displaying a picture
pertaining to picture signals of a variety of television systems.In a television apparatus including a display device having
an aspect ratio of the display surface of 4 : 3, there has
hitherto been proposed a so-called multi-standard television
apparatus in which picture signals of a variety of television
systems, such as NTSC or PAL systems, are selectively supplied
for enabling the picture to be displayed. One multi-standard
television is disclosed in European Patent Application No.
0,551,168, for example.With the multi-standard television apparatus, the horizontal
deflection period (fH) of these various systems when the NTSC
system picture signals are supplied differs from that when the
PAL system picture signals are supplied so that the stationary
phase error in the phase comparator of the line lock PLL circuit
constituting the deflection circuit for the NTSC system differs
from that for the PAL system to produce a difference in the
position of the displayed picture in the horizontal direction. Such difference in the picture display position caused by
the difference in the television systems may be corrected by
setting plural adjustment points for the NTSC system, the PAL
system or the like in the deflection circuit. However, such
adjustment of the deflection circuit complicates the manufacture
and adjustment of the television apparatus.Consequently, the difference in the display picture position
due to the difference in the television systems is over looked
without being corrected in the television apparatus for the
purpose of simplifying the manufacture.In the above-described so-called multi-standard television
apparatus, such apparatus has been proposed in which the aspect
ratio of the display surface is set to 16 : 9 for conformity to
the HDTV (so-called hi-vision) system. If the picture with the
aspect ratio of 4 : 3 is displayed in such multi-standard
television apparatus, frame portions are formed on the left and
right sides of a region corresponding to the aspect ratio of 4: 3
on the display surface of a CRT 9, on which the picture is to be
displayed, as shown in Fig.18.If, in the multi-standard television apparatus, having the
aspect ratio of the display surface of 16 : 9, the difference in
