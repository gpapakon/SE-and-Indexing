<ABSTRACT>
An antenna is provided on a circuit board (10) which 
has an elongated stub (14), having an end connected through 

a dielectric to a ground plane (12). The ground plane/stub 
combination forms a resonant cavity (18). The stub (14) has 

a electrically conductive sail (20) for increasing the 
omnidirectionality and sensitivity of the antenna.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to antennas for
receiving RF signals and more particularly increasing the
sensitivity of a resonant cavity formed on a printed circuit
board.Document EP-A-0 163 454 discloses a microstrip antenna which
comprises a ground conductor plane and a radiating conductor
plane arranged on opposite sides respectively of a dielectric
substrate and a connecting conductor plane connecting together
the radiating and the ground conductor plane. The
known antenna has a unipole antenna perpendicular to and
electrically coupled to the radiating conductor plane at one
end thereof.The application is related to copending application
entitled, "Tunable Circuit Board Antenna", U.S. Patent
Application No. 08/130936, which is commonly owned,
simultaneously filed herewith, and
published as EP 0 646 986.Some antennas formed on circuit boards have a
resonant cavity defined by a ground plane on one side of the
circuit board, a formed piece of strip line referred to as a
stub on the other side of the circuit board and an
electrical connection between them. The shape and length of
the stub determines the resonant frequency of the cavity.
Generally, the stub is formed of strip line shaped on a
circuit board. However, due to their flat nature, antennas
formed on circuit boards principally receive signals in the
direction normal to the plane of the antenna and arriving at
the stub side of the circuit board. Signals arriving at the
ground plane side of the circuit board are substantially
blocked from the cavity.An advantage of the present invention is to increase
the sensitivity of the antenna to reception of RF signals
from directions other than the normal.A preferred embodiment of the present invention
includes a dielectric layer having a first side and a second
side, an electrically conductive ground plane disposed on
the first side, and an electrically conductive stub disposed
on the second side having one end electrically connected to
the ground plane for forming a resonant cavity that is
excited by the RF signal when the RF signal arrives at the
stub. An electrically conductive sail extends in a 
generally perpendicular direction from the stub electrically
connected to the stub for increasing the directions by which
the RF signal will excite the cavity.The invention will now be described further, by way
of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in
which:FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the preferred
embodiment.FIG. 2 is a top view of the preferred embodiment.FIG. 3 is a cross-sectional
