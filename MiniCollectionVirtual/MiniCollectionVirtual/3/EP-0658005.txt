<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an oscillation circuitry having at 
least one three-state invertor circuit being shifted between in 

a high impedance output state and in performing an invertor 
function. The three state invertor circuit is controlled by a 

gain control circuit. The circuitry includes at least two of the 
three state invertor circuits, one of which being in the high 

impedance output state and other performing the invertor 
function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an oscillation circuit, and more 
particularly to an oscillation circuit with a reduced current 
dissipation property. Various types of oscillation circuitries have been known in the 
art, one of which is illustrated in FIG. 1. A conventional 
oscillation control circuit includes an invertor circuit having 
an input connected to a terminal V1 and an output connected to a 
terminal V2 in which the invertor circuit comprises a pair of p-channel 
and n-channel MOS field effect transistors M1 and M2, 
both os which are connected in series between a high voltage 
line VDD and a ground line. The conventional oscillation control 
circuit also includes a transfer circuit connected between the 
terminals V1 and V2 and comprising a pair of p-channel and n-channel 
MOS field effect transistors M3 and M4. The conventional  
 
oscillation control circuit further includes an n-channel MOS 
field effect transistor M5 connected between the terminal V1 and 
the ground line, an invertor circuit INV1 having an input side 
connected to the terminal V2. The conventional oscillation 
circuit is moreover provided with an invertor circuit INV2 
having an output connected to a gate of the p-channel MOS field 
effect transistor M3 and an input connected to a gate of the n-channel 
MOS transistor M4 as well as provided with a NOR gate 
circuit NOR2. The oscillation circuit has three states in which a first state 
is in crystal oscillation, a second state is in an external 
clock signal oscillation state and an oscillation stop state. 
The three states are selectable by varying voltage levels of 
terminals Vx and Vs. In the crystal oscillation, a crystal oscillator is provided 
between the terminals V1 and V2 and further the terminals Vx and 
Vs come into low levels. As a result, the n-channel MOS field 
effect transistor M5 turns OFF and the p-channel MOS/field 
effect transistor M3 and the n-channel MOS filed effect 
transistor turn ON so that the transfer circuit turns ON 
performing as a feedback resistance. The invertor circuit 
comprising the p-channel MOS field effect transistor M1 and the 
n-channel MOS field effect transistor M2 performs as an 
alternating current amplifier for oscillation.  In the external clock signal oscillation, external clock signals 
are inputted into the terminal V1 as well as the terminals Vx 
and Vs come into the high and low levels respectively thereby 
the n-channel MOS field effect transistor M5 turns OFF as well 
as the transfer circuit comprising the n-channel and
