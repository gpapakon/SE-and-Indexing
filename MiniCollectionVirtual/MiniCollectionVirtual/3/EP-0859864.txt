<ABSTRACT>
In a method for determining the existence of a mutation in a nucleic acid fragment from an electric signal generated by a DNA sequencer and made up of sequence information produced by fluorescent fragment products of different lengths of said nucleic acid fragment, followed by a run-off peak produced by fluorescent full length fragment products of said nucleic acid fragment, any difference between said run-off peak and a reference run-off peak generated by unmutated full length fragment products of said nucleic acid fragment, is determined, a difference indicating the existence of a deletion or insertion mutation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for determining
the existence of a mutation in a nucleic acid fragment
from an electric signal generated by a DNA sequencer and made
up of sequence information produced by fluorescent fragment
products of different lengths of said nucleic acid fragment,
followed by a run-off peak produced by fluorescent full length
fragment products of said nucleic acid fragment.DNA sequencing, i.e. determining the sequence of nucleotides
in a gene or in a segment of DNA, commonly involves several
sequential steps aimed at:
Isolating genetic material from biological material.Amplifying the gene of interest using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) so that sufficient material of the gene of interest
is available for sequence analysis.Performing sequencing reactions using the principles of
Sanger. This step enzymatically generates a large number of
differently elongated complementary copies of the gene. By
introduction of base specific elongation terminators, each
elongated copy of the gene will terminate with a specific
type of nucleotide. Each reaction corresponds to one specific
type of nucleotide, Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G) or
Cytosine (C), i.e. only one type of elongation terminator,
will be incorporated in each reaction. To enable detection of
these elongated gene copies, a fluorescently labelled molecule
is introduced in the gene copy during the enzymatic reaction.
Thus, all elongated gene copies will be fluorescently
labelled to facilitate their detection.Separating the mixture of differently elongated complementary
copies of the gene according to their molecular size
using gel electrophoresis.Sequentially detecting the differently elongated complementary 
copies of the gene, separated according to molecular
size during gel electrophoresis, using a DNA sequencer system,
e.g. the DNA sequencer marketed under the trademark ALF
by Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden. During the electrophoresis,
any fluorescent molecules passing a perpendicularly
oriented laser beam, will be activated and the fluorescence
from each molecule will be detected by light sensitive
detectors, each representing one type of nucleotide in the
sample.Determining the nucleotide sequence by superimposing the
signals from four detectors representing the four different
nucleotides of the sample gene.An example of such signals obtained from four such detectors
is shown in Fig. 1 on the appended drawing. As apparent, the
diagram in Fig. 1 is divided into a sequence region, containing
sequence

Method for determining the existence of 
an
insertion or a deletion
 mutation in a nucleic acid fragment
from an electric signal generated by a DNA sequencer and

made up of sequence information produced by fluorescent
products of different lengths of said nucleic acid

fragment, followed by a run-off peak produced by
fluorescent full length fragment products of said nucleic

acid fragment, 
characterized by
 determining any difference
between said run-off peak and a reference run-off peak

generated by unmutated full length fragment products of
said nucleic acid fragment, a difference indicating the

existence of a deletion or insertion mutation.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said difference between said run-off peak and said
reference run-off peak is determined by measuring any

difference in peak width between these run-off peaks, a
wider run-off peak ending after said reference run-off

peak, indication an insertion mutation, while a wider run-off
peak beginning before said reference run-off peak

indicating a deletion mutation, the size of the peak width
difference being directly proportional to the size of the

mutation.
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 said difference between said run-off peak and said
reference run-off peak is determined by measuring any

difference between the location of the centres of these
run-off peaks, a location of the centre of said run-off

peak in front of the centre of said reference run-off peak
indicating a deletion mutation, a location of the centre of

said run-off peak after the centre of said reference run-off
peak indicating an insertion mutation, the size of said

difference being directly proportional to the size of the
mutation.
Apparatus for determining the existence of 
an

between these run-off peaks, a wider run-off peak ending

after said reference run-off peak, indicating an
insertion mutation, while a wider run-off peak beginning

before said reference run-off peak indicating a deletion
mutation, the size of the peak width difference being

directly proportional to the size of the mutation.
