<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel 
derivative of an antibiotic erythromycin, and more 
particularly relates to a novel 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
A derivative and pharmaceutically 
acceptable acid addition salts thereof. Erythromycins are antibiotics clinically 
widely used as agents for treating infectious diseases 
caused by Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative 
bacteria, mycoplasmas, etc. Many erythromycin 
derivatives have been prepared for the improvement of 
biological and pharmaceutical properties of 
erythromycins. Certain ketone forms at the 3-position 
of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide A have been described in 
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, vol. 6, No. 4, 
page 479 (1974) and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 
17, No. 9, page 953 (1974), but generally they have 
extremely weak antibacterial activity. An object of the 
present invention is to provide a novel antibiotic 
having a strong antibacterial activity. As a result of various researches on the  
 
antibacterial activity of 3-ketone forms of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
A derivatives, the present 
inventors have found that a 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
A derivative, which falls within the formula of the 
specification of EP patent No. 0487411 but is not 
specifically described therein, has a extremely strong 
antibacterial activity, and the present invention has 
been accomplished. The present invention relates to 11-amino-3,11-dideoxy-3-oxo-5-O-desosaminyl-6-O-methylerythronolide 
A 11-N,12-O-cyclic carbamate and a 
pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. In the present invention, the pharmaceutically 
acceptable acid addition salt means, for example, 
acetate, propionate, butyrate, formate, trifluoroacetate, 
maleate, tartrate, citrate, stearate, 
succinate, ethylsuccinate, lactobionate, gluconate, 
glucoheptonate, benzoate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 
2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, 
p-toluenesulfonate, laurylsulfate, malate, aspartate, 
glutaminate, adipate, cysteine salt, hydrochloride, 
hydrobromide, phosphate, sulfate, hydroiodide, 
nicotinate, oxalate, picrate, thiocyanate, undecanoate, 
polyacrylate or carboxyvinyl polymer salt. The compound of the present invention can be 
prepared, for example, as follows. Step (1); 6-O-Methylerythromycin A is first 
reacted with an acid anhydride represented by the 
formula Râ‚‚O (wherein R is an acetyl group or a propionyl 
group) or an acid halide represented by the formula RX 
(wherein R is as defined above, and X is a halogen
