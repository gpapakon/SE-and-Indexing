<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to motion detection 
systems. State of the art systems for monitoring sites to be 
protected and identifying what appear to be moving objects include 
the following systems: the DS-1 and DS-16 digital video 
motion detectors, commercially available from DigiSpec Corporation, 
CA, USA, the David 200, commercially available from Senstar 
Inc., MA, USA, the Geutebruck VS-30, commercially available from 
Geutebruck GmbH of West Germany, the Adpro VMD-10, commercially 
available from Vision Security Inc., NJ, USA, the MOVICOM, commercially 
available from Hymaton RJS Industries, P.O.B. 3426, 
Santa Fe Springs, CA, USA, and the Digiplex 4000 commercially 
available from Vision Research Company Ltd., 2 Marples Way, 
Havant, Hampshire, UK.  The present invention seeks to provide an improved 
motion detection system. There is thus provided in accordance with a preferred 
embodiment of the present invention a motion detection system 
including a motion direction definition receiver operative to 
accept a definition of at least one direction of motion, and a 
moving object detector operative to detect an object only if it 
is moving in one of the at least one directions of motion. There is also provided in accordance with another 
preferred embodiment of the present invention a motion detection 
system including a motion parameter definition receiver operative 
to accept at least one reference object characteristic of a 
moving object and at least one reference motion characteristic of 
the motion of the moving object, and a moving object detector 
operative to detect an object in motion, wherein at least one 
characteristic of the object corresponds to the at least one 
reference object characteristic and at least one characteristic 
of the motion corresponds to the at least one reference motion 
characteristic. Further in accordance with a preferred embodiment of 
the present invention the at least one reference motion characteristic 
includes at least one reference actual motion characteristic 
which may be compared to at least one actual motion characteristic 
of an object in motion, computed from an image of an  
 
object in motion. Still further in accordance with a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention the at least one reference motion characteristic 
includes at least one of the following characteristics: 
a reference maximum actual velocity, and a reference 
minimum actual velocity. Additionally in accordance with a preferred embodiment 
of the present invention the

<CLAIMS>
A motion detection system comprising: 
   a motion direction definition receiver operative to 

accept a definition of at least one direction of motion; and 
   a moving object detector operative to detect an object 

only if it is moving in one of said at least one directions of 
motion. 
A motion detection system comprising: 
   a motion parameter definition receiver operative to 

accept at least one reference object characteristic of a moving 
object and at least one reference motion characteristic of the 

motion of the moving object; and 
   a moving object detector operative to detect an object 

in motion, wherein at least one characteristic of the object 
corresponds to the at least one reference object characteristic 

and at least one characteristic of the motion corresponds to the 
at least one reference motion characteristic. 
A motion detection system comprising: 
   a moving object detector operative to detect an object 

in motion, wherein at least one characteristic of the motion 
corresponds to at least one reference motion characteristic; and 

   a human intruder identifier for identifying a detected 
moving object as resembling a human intruder. 
A motion tracking system comprising: 
   a representation of at least one scene from a site to 

be protected; 
   an intensity change detector for detecting changes in 

intensity in the representation of the at least one scene to be 
protected, over time; 

   a moving object identifier for identifying changes in 
intensity with predetermined characteristics, as a moving object; 

   an object tracker for tracking the moving object; and 
   trajectory display apparatus for displaying the trajectory 

of the moving object.

for identifying a change in intensity corresponding to at least 

 
one predetermined actual characteristic of the scene, as a moving 

object, wherein the relationship between the predetermined actual 
characteristic and the image thereof depends on the distance 

between the moving object and the camera.
