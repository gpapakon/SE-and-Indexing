<ABSTRACT>
The device has a first lamina (19) and a second lamina 
(23) that are arranged opposite one another and are 

supported by pairs of fixed (20) and respectively movable 
bars (24) that engage the ends of the respective laminae, 

flexing them in an arched shape; the laminae are arranged 
opposite each other at their convex face. The movable bars 

(24) are supported by a corresponding movable element (26) 
which is suspended elastically and is provided with an 

energization coil (31) that is subjected to the field of a 
permanent magnet (27). The coil (31) of the movable element 

(26) is supplied with an energization current (I) that is

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for the 
modulated braking of the thread for devices that feed weft 
to looms or textile machines. As is known, weft feeders are devices that are suitable 
to accumulate a reserve of thread in the form of turns wound 
around a fixed drum and to feed the loom by unwinding the 
accumulated turns by an amount equal to the length of thread 
required by the loom at each beating; this length is equal 
to the transverse dimension, or height, of the fabric being 
formed. During its motion for unwinding from the drum, the 
thread is subjected to the action of a braking means which 
is also associated with the weft feeder; the braking means 
has the purpose of keeping said thread at a preset 
mechanical tension that is suitable to ensure its correct 
unwinding. During the beating, the thread advancement speed varies 
in an approximately sinusoidal manner, and the action of the 
braking means, which depends on the friction coefficient 
between the thread and the braking means, varies 
accordingly. Consequently, the tension of the thread is 
subject to considerable and undesirable increases that cause 
frequent breakage. In order to avoid this severe drawback, it has already 
been proposed to positively modulate the action of the 
braking means, adapting it to the instantaneous values of 
the advancement speed or to the mechanical tension of the 
thread. Electromagnetically operated modulated-braking devices 
have already been produced for this purpose; in these  
 
devices, the braking means is rigidly coupled to a moving 
element that supports an energization coil immersed in the 
field of a permanent magnet. The energization coil is 
supplied with a current that varies in proportion to the 
thread advancement rate or to its mechanical tension, and 
this energization current, by interacting with the field of 
the permanent magnet, modulates the action of the braking 
means in order to keep the tension of said thread 
substantially constant. A typical modulated-action braking means of 
conventional devices is constituted by a rigid body which is 
pressed with variable force against the drum, or against a 
portion of the drum, of the feeder; the thread runs between 
said body and said drum or drum portion. This known solution has some drawbacks. In fact, on one 
hand it considerably complicates the structure of the 
feeder, because it is necessary to have an adjustable and 
flexible support for the braking body, and on the other hand 
the rigid body that forms the braking
