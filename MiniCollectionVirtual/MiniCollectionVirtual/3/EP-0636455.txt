<ABSTRACT>
A clamp nut 10 comprising a split threaded nut 12 for engaging a 
threaded spindle (not shown), a coiled spring 16 encircling the split 

nut 12, means 20 for holding the spring 16 tightly coiled around the 
split nut 12 and a cap 30, engaging the spring 16, which can be 

turned in a first direction (A) to tighten the spring 16 around the split 
nut 12 and in a reverse direction to release the holding means 20 

thereby loosening the spring 16 around the split nut 12 and enabling 
the split nut 12 to expand radially to facilitate removal of the clamp 

nut 10 from a threaded spindle. The mechanism for releasing the 
holding means 20 preferably includes a cam surface 32, formed 

integrally with the cap 30, which lifts an end 19 of the coiled spring 
16 off a set of ratchet teeth.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to clamp nuts, and in particular
to a clamp nut for securing rotary discs onto the spindles
of power tools, such as a grinding wheel on to the spindle
of an angle grinder or a circular saw blade on to the
spindle of a circular saw.Conventionally the spindles of such power tools are
screw threaded and the discs have been secured by a lock nut
which is locked in place by a spanner and which must also be
released by use of the spanner. More recently, flange locks
have been developed which can be safely secured and released
by hand without the use of a tool. The present invention
aims to provide an improved clamp nut which can be secured
and released by hand.United States Patent Application No.US-A-4930961
discloses a quick locking and releasable fastener in the
form of a split nut with a circumferentially truncated
thread, which split nut is drawn together or separable by a
cam operable by rotation in one form or by reciprocation in
a second form, to be placed over an externally threaded
member and threadedly engaged therewith by a fractional turn
of a head in the first form, or by reciprocation of a head
in the second form. There is a spring return for separation
of the split nut. The split nut disclosed is cam-operated to
contract together and cam-controlled to separate. The cam
is manually operable by turning.In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention
provides a clamp nut comprising a threaded collet for
engaging a threaded spindle; a coiled spring closely
encircling the collet holding means for holding the spring
in fixed relationship with the collet; a cap engaging one
end of the spring, which can be turned in a first direction
to engage the spring with the holding means and in a reverse 
direction to release the spring from the holding means, and
whereby the collet can expand radially, when the spring is
released from the holding means, to facilitate removal of
the clamp nut from the spindle.A significant advantage of a clamp nut according to the
present invention is that the initial tightness of the nut
on a spindle of a power tool, for example, can be readily
released, thereby facilitating complete removal of the clamp
nut from the spindle. Preferably the holding means includes a ratchet face
which engages the coiled spring.The ratchet face may be formed on a pressure member
which supports the collet. Alternatively, the ratchet face
could possibly be formed on the collet itself.The pressure member preferably includes guide pegs
which engage slots in the collet to

<CLAIMS>
A clamp nut (10) comprising a threaded collet (12) for
engaging a threaded spindle; a coiled spring (16) closely

encircling the collet (12) holding means (18,20) for holding
the spring (16) in fixed relationship with the collet (12);

a cap (30) engaging one end of the spring (16), which can be
turned in a first direction to engage the spring (16) with

the holding means (18,20) and in a reverse direction to
release the spring (16) from the holding means (18,20), and

whereby the collet (12) can expand radially, when the spring
(16) is released from the holding means (18,20), to

facilitate removal of the clamp nut (10) from the spindle.
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
holding means (18,20) includes a ratchet face (20) which

engages the coiled spring (16).
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in claim 2, wherein the
ratchet face (20) is formed on a pressure member (22) which

supports the collet (12).
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in claim 3, wherein the
pressure member (22) includes guide pegs (28) which engage

slots in the collet (12) to control the radial movement of
the collet (12).
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein a first end (17) of the coiled spring engages a

recess (18) in the collet (12) to prevent rotation of the
spring (16) around the collet (12).
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the cap (30) includes a cam surface (32) for bearing

against a second end (19) of the coiled spring (16) to
release the coiled spring (16) from the holding means

(18,20) when the cap (30) is turned in the reverse
direction. 
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein at least one stop (36) is provided for restricting

relative rotation between the cap and the collet.
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the cap (30) includes a central aperture (46)

through which a threaded spindle can pass, in use.
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein a circlip (42) engages a groove (44) in the cap (30)

to retain the coiled spring, the collet (12) and the holding
means (18,20) together.
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein an O-ring forms a seal between the cap (10) and the

collet (12).
A clamp nut (10) as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the threaded collet (12) is split into three

segments.
A clamp nut as claimed in claim 3 or in any of claims 4
to 11 when dependent on claim 3 in which said collet (12) is

supported on a frusto-conical surface of said pressure
member (22) to facilitate said radial expansion of the

collet (12).
