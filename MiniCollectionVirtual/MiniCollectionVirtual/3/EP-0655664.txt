<ABSTRACT>
Winding-button (1) mounted on a guide tube (T) fixed in a casing (C) housing a timepiece, and solid, both in rotation and axially, with a control shaft (TR) which can occupy at least two axial positions, a first ("0") of which is stable and a second ("-1") of which is fleeting, comprising   - a head (2) solid with the said shaft and mounted so as to be able to move axially on the said tube (T), and - a restoring spring (8) bearing via one end on the said head (2) so as to draw it towards the said stable position, where - the said spring (8) also bears via its other end on an annular stop (9) which can move in said head (2) between the said stable position, in which the said stop (9) bears on a shoulder (13) inside the said head (2) and the said fleeting position, in which the stop (9) rests on a shoulder (E3) of the said tube (T).

Push-piece-crown (1) for a timepiece, intended to 
be mounted on a guide tube (T) secured in a case (C) 

housing said timepiece and to be fixed in rotation as well 
as axially to a control stem (TR) also belonging to said 

timepiece, said stem (TR) being capable of occupying at 
least two axial positions of which a first ("0") is stable 

and a second ("-1") is transitory, said push-piece crown 
(1) comprising 


a head (2) intended to be fixed to said stem and 
mounted to be axially movable on said tube (T) so as to be 

capable of being axially positioned in at least two 
distinct positions corresponding to said positions of the 

stem (TR) for controlling at least one function of said 
timepiece, and 
a return spring (8) bearing at one end on said 
head (2) in order to urge it towards said stable position, 

said push-piece-crown (1) being characterized in that 
said spring (8) also bears at its other end on an 
annular abutment (9) movable within said head (2) between 

a first position, which corresponds to said stable 
position, in which said abutment (9) is supported on a 

shoulder (13) arranged in the interior of said head (2) in 
a manner to assure the precompression of said spring (8) 

and a second position corresponding to said transitory 
position, in which the abutment (9) rests on a shoulder 

(E3) arranged on said tube (T). 
Push-piece-crown according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said movable annular abutment (9) is 

located within said head (2) when said head (2) is in said 
stable position ("0") in being supported on an element 

(13) forming an axial shoulder arranged within said head 
(2). 
Push-piece-crown according to claim 2, characterized 
in that said shoulder forming element (13) is a 

"circlips" located in an annular internal groove (6) of 
said head (2).  

 
Push-piece-crown according to any one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that the precompression 

of said spring (8) is at least around 60% of 
its maximum compression brought about when all of its 

coils are squeezed against one another. 
Push-piece-crown according to any of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that it further 

comprises a sealing gasket (14, 15) located between said 
head (2) and said tube (T) and isolating said push-piece-crown 

(1) and its spring (8) from the exterior as well as 
the timepiece movement from the exterior. 
Push-piece-crown according to claim 5, characterized 
in that said sealing gasket (14, 15) is maintained 

within said head (1) by washers, one of which is in axial 
support against said shoulder forming element (13) and the 

other of which is engaged in an annular groove (7) formed 
in the interior of said head (1). 
Timepiece characterized in that it comprises a 
push-piece-crown according to any one of the preceding 

claims.
