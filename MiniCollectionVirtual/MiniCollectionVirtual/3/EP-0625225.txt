Base plate for guide means having the 
features: 


a base body (17), configured as a prism, 
is provided, 
one part (13.1) of a coupling device (13) 
is disposed on the upper side (14) of the 

base body (17), by means of which coupling 
device a guide body (12) is connectable to 

the base body (17), on which the other 
part of the coupling device (13) is 

disposed, 
the base plate (11) comprises an 
additional coupling device (21), the parts 

of which are divided into two groups, of 
which one group (21.1) is disposed at one 

end and the other group (21.2) is disposed 
at the other end of the base body (17), 


by means of which coupling device the 
base plate (11) is connectable to an  

 
identical base plate (11), lying 

adjacent thereto when viewed with 
respect to the longitudinal direction, 

both in the longitudinal direction and 
in the transverse direction, 
the base plate (11) is narrower in the 
region of its upper side (14) than in the 

region of its underside (25), 
 
characterised by the features: 


the base body (17) has a cross-sectional 
configuration with an envelope curve (31) 

abutting against the lateral walls (29) 
and the upper side (14), 


which curve has a configuration which 
is at least approximately constant, 
which curve is convexly curved or 
rectilinear in the region of the upper 

side (14) and is convexly curved in  
 

the portion (29.2) of the two lateral 
walls (29) communicating therewith, 

and 
which curve is either also convexly 
curved or at the most rectilinear as 

far as the tangent to the preceding 
curve portion (29.2) in the portion 

(29.1) of the two lateral walls (29) 
extending to the underside, 
at least one step (32), which is inwardly 
offset relative to the envelope curve 

(31), is provided in the region of each 
lateral wall (29), 


which step communicates in its lower 
portion with the envelope curve (31) 

by means of an edge (33), and 
which step extends in its upper 
portion at least in an approximately 

constantly curved manner into the 
envelope curve (31). 
Base plate according to claim 1, characterised 
by the feature: 


the portions (38) of the envelope curve 
(31) situated in the transitional region 

from the lateral walls (29) to the upper 
side (14) of the base plate (11) have a 

greater curvature than the portions 
communicating therewith at both ends. 
Base plate according to claim 2, characterised 
by the feature: 


the portion (14) of the envelope curve 
(31) forming the upper side (14) of the 

base plate (11) has a gentler curvature 
than the portions (38) communicating 

therewith, but at the most it is 
rectilinear as far as the tangent to the 

adjacent portions (38).
