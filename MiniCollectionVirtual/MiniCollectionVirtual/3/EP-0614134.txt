<ABSTRACT>
A wire guidance apparatus for an automated guided vehicle which 
comprises a first crossed coil sensor for acquiring a wire and tracking along 

curves in the wire as the vehicle is travelling in the forward direction, a second 
crossed coil sensor for acquiring the wire and tracking along the wire when 

the vehicle is travelling in the reverse direction, third and fourth sensors for 
tracking along straight runs in the wire. and circuitry for switching between the 

crossed coil sensors and the third and fourth sensors. Circuitry is also 
provided to generate a guidance error signal from the outputs of either of the 

crossed coil sensors or both the third and fourth sensors. The guidance error 
signal is then used to control a motor connected to a steerable wheel of the 

vehicle to maintain the vehicle in alignment with the wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to automated guided vehicles and, more 
particularly, to automated guided vehicles that comprise sensors or antenna 
coils for guiding the vehicles along a wire imbedded in a floor. Automated guided vehicles which utilize guide wire navigation are 
known in the art. One example of such a vehicle is an automated lift truck, 
which typically operates along narrow aisles between, e.g., shelves in a 
warehouse. These vehicles comprise sensors or antenna coils which 
respond to magnetic fields generated by guide wires imbedded in the floor 
along a predetermined path. The voltages induced in the coils are 
representative of the lateral displacement error, or lateral distance from the 
centerline of the vehicle to the centerline of the coils, and the heading angle 
error, or the angle between the centerline of the vehicle and the centerline of 
the coils. The induced voltages are used to generate a steering correction 
error signal, which in turn is used to control a motor or similar mechanism 
which can turn the steerable wheel to maintain the coils, and therefore the 
vehicle, aligned with the wire as the vehicle is moving. Thus, the coils provide 
a means by which the vehicle can track along the wire and thereby stay within 
a predefined path. Typically, an operator is required to align the vehicle over 
the wire, although some automated guided vehicles are capable of acquiring 
the wire, or aligning the coils with the wire, to some degree once the vehicle is 
placed over the wire. An automated guided vehicle with two pairs of symmetrically arranged coils in which 
one coil each is arranged vertically and the other one horizontally is disclosed in DE-OS 
2648105. The drawback of this prior art automated guided vehicle is the lack in 
responsiveness to heading angle errors caused by the specific symmetric coil arrangement. 
Similar coil arrangements are disclosed in GB 2080576 and EP 0055304. 
Accordingly, they show the same drawback with respect to responsive steering correction. Examples of such automated guided vehicles are also disclosed in U.S. 
Patent No. 4,307,329, issued to Taylor, and U.S. Patent No. 4,310,789, issued 
to Mank et al. These patents recognize that, to achieve close tracking at high 
speeds, the coils should provide a steering correction signal that is much 
more responsive to the heading angle error than to the lateral displacement 
error. This is due to the fact that lateral displacement error increases relative 
to the time integral of the vehicle velocity
