<ABSTRACT>
A method to analyze, separate and micro-encapsulate 
cell, sub-cell or multi-cell elements is described, comprising to 

resuspend the elements in a medium at least containing a 
substance having solidifying ability, to load the fluid in a flow-cytometry 

apparatus, to separate micro-drops containing no more 
than only one element, and to solidify these microdrops.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method to select cell
elements, including mono-, multi- or sub-cell elements, that is
specially useful for vegetal cell treatments when flow-cytometry
procedures are involved.The modern biotechnologies made practical to
manipulate the genetic properties of organisms, embryos and
cells by stable introduction of exogeneous genes, that
provide a new phenotype to recipient cells, such as resistance
against patogenic agents or environmental stress, or capability to
generate new metabolites. Also somatic hybridation or high-level
of secondary metabolite induction techniques (2) are comprised
in the cell manipulation methods.When vegetal cells are involved, due to the totipotency
thereof, regenerate plants could be obtained having new
characteristics, which could be very largely and advantegeously
used in the agronomy, industry and food production fields (3).A main limiting reason in spreading the cell
manipulation methods to a large extent is the problem to detect
and select the manipulated cells, as often they result as a very
low fraction of the whole cell population. In order to overcame
such problem, cell lines are used as recipient cells, that are
selected according to special requirements, such as the ability to
be cultivated in the presence of selective toxic substances.
However, the use of such "laboratory" cell lines is a further limit
to apply these methods on agro-industrial scale.The detection methods of manipulated cells by
fluorescent markers, vital dyes, molecular probes or antibodies,
associated to the flow-cytofluorometry, allow virtually to use any
type of cell or cell sub-structure through a qualitative and
quantitative analysis of the fluorescent emission and the
automatic quick separation of the interesting elements. The cell 
elements, having a fluid substrate as vehicle, are intercepted
once at the time, and the signal quality and intensity analyzed.
The corresponding signal to any single cell element could be
identified and separated from the other element signals by means
of an electrical polarization and micro-drop fractionating
mechanism of the cell flow, that is controlled by the vibrations of
a piezoelectric crystal. The electrical charged droplets, containing
the actual interesting elements, could be separated through
deviating its from the normal trajectories when passing through a
stationary electric field, and then collected under sterilization
conditions into any suitable container.A number of examples of these techniques are found in
animal and
