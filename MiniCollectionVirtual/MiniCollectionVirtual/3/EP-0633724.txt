<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for protecting crop plants from Eyespot disease (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides), using one or more Pseudomonas fluorescens strains deposited at the National Collection of Industrial and Marine Bacteria under the accession numbers NCIB 40186, 40187, 40188, 40189 and 40190. Compositions for use in this method are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of
protecting crop plants from fungal attack by the
use of antifungal micro-organisms. More
specifically, the invention relates to a method of
controlling Eyespot disease by the use of strains
of Pseudomonasfluorescens.Eyespot, caused by the fungus
Pseudocercosporellaherpotrichoides (Fron.
Deighton), is a potentially damaging stembase
disease of cereals, especially winter wheat. The
pathogen survives on straw from the previous crop
and sporulates during cool weather in winter and
early spring (Fitt et al, 1988, Plant Pathology,
37, 311-328). Conidia are splash-dispersed by
rainfall onto the stembases of the new crop.
Germination is followed by germ-tube extension,
formation of appressoria and penetration of the
coleoptile (Daniels et al, 1991, Mycological
Research, 95, 385-397). Subsequently runner hyphae
are formed and sequential penetration of leaf
sheaths occurs from differentiated mycelial
plaques. Visual symptoms of the disease eventually
develop with stembase browning and formation of
characteristic "eye-shaped" lesions. The fungus
exists as both W- and R-pathotypes.Annual losses caused by Eyespot disease in the
UK have been estimated at Â£20-30 million on average
(Fitt et al, 1990, Annals of Applied Biology, 117,
473-486). Protecting crops from the disease
therefore presents a significant problem. Effective control of Eyespot was initially
provided by MBC fungicides but resistance to these
compounds, first reported in 1981, became
widespread (King and Griffin, 1985, Plant
Pathology, 34, 272-283). Chemical control of the
fungus now relies to a large extent on the sterol
biosynthesis inhibitor (SBI), prochloraz. Other
SBI fungicides are less effective, especially
against the R-pathotype (Bateman, 1990, Zeitschrift
fur Pflanzenkrankheiten und Pflanzenschutz, 97,
508-516). Host genetic resistance to eyespot is
available but has not been incorporated into
currently recommended cultivars (Hollins et al,
1988, Plant Pathology, 37, 251-260).As current methods of control are
unsatisfactory, there has been an increased
interest in developing integrated management
strategies for control of the disease, including
cultural methods (Fitt et al, 1990, Annals of
Applied Biology, 117, 473-486), and biological
control agents or biopesticides once suitable
agents become available.Both bacteria and fungi have been reported to
suppress a number of soilborne and foliar diseases
of cereals (Reinecke, 1981 in Blakeman (ed),
Microbial Ecology of the Phylloplane, 383-395;
Weller, 1988,
