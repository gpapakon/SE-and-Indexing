<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a rasp (1) with hollow shaft for preparation of a tubular bone to receive a stem-like endoprosthesis. A handle can be fixed proximally to the rasp (1) with hollow shaft. The rasp essentially comprises a hollow pipe (2), the wall (3) of which is provided with a unidirectionally acting scraping profile (4) and which has a longitudinal slot (6) medially. The material removed (spongiosa, bone marrow) on preparation of the reception space for the endoprosthesis reaches the interior of the hollow pipe. This effectively prevents thromboses or embolisms during the operation.

<CLAIMS>
Hollow shaft rasp (1) for preparation of a tubular bone for using a stem-shaped 
endoprosthesis, to which a hand grip can be attached proximally and which comprises 

a hollow tube (2), into the wall (3) of which is incorporated a unidirectionally acting 
scraping profile (4), characterised in that the hollow tube (2) has a longitudinal slot 

(6) medially, which imparts a spring effect to the hollow tube (2). 
Hollow shaft rasp according to claim 1, in which a connection piece, to which a 
suction unit can be connected, is provided proximally. 
Hollow shaft rasp according to claim 1 or 2, which essentially has the external 
contour of the stem of the endoprosthesis to be implanted.
