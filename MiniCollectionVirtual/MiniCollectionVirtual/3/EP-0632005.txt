<ABSTRACT>
There is described a process for the production of a 
substantially anhydrous salt of an organic acid which 

comprises reacting a basic compound of a metal with 
the appropriate organic acid, removing a substantial 

proportion of water present so as to produce the salt 
or its hydrate as a liquid phase and then dissolving 

the liquid phase in a non-aqueous solvent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the production
of potassium 2-ethyl hexanoate.The production of metal salts of organic acids by
the reaction of a basic compound of the metal with
the appropriate acid is known. However, such a
process usually produces water as a function of the
acid-base neutralisation reaction which occurs. This
water is usually undesirable and has to be removed by
physical means to yield the anhydrous salt which is
normally required. Many techniques have been proposed
for removing this water, for example, distillation.
However, high temperatures or vacuum are needed to
make this process efficient, which is often
impractical because the salts formed are normally high
melting solids, and unless special equipment is
utilised do not lend themselves to easy or effective
processing. Indeed, in some cases, conventional
methods for removal of water by the use of heat, even
with reduced pressure, lead to a material from which
removal of further water (free or water of hydration)
is difficult by conventional heating methods.US-A-4 142 059 discloses a process wherein an aqueous
solution of sodium or potassium 2-ethyl hexanoate is spray
dried in a spray drier to provide the corresponding sodium or
potassium 2-ethyl hexanoate having a moisture content of
from about 0.5 to about 5.0 percent by weight therefrom. According to the present invention there is
provided a process for the production of a
substantially anhydrous potassium 2-ethyl hexanoate
(i.e. having a water content of 0.05% to 5% based on 
the weight of the product) which comprises reacting a
basic compound of potassium with 2 ethyl hexanoic
acid, and removing a substantial proportion of water
present (i.e. to a content of 0.5% to 5% based on the
weight of the product) so as to produce the salt or
its hydrate as a liquid phase.Preferably the liquid phase obtained is dissolved
in a non aqueous solvent.The water present arises not only from water
which may have been present as the solvent for an
aqueous solution of the basic compound used in the
reaction but may also be produced by the reaction
itself. A substantial proportion of such water
present may be removed eg. to a level of 0.05%
to 5% based on the weight of the product, preferably
0.5 to 1.5%, most preferably about 1% by
conventional distillation, usually at atmospheric
pressure, utilizing temperatures up to the order of
350Â°C. The water removal is preferably carried out in
two stages, the first one removing part of the water
eg. to a level of 5 to 20% followed by a second
removal
