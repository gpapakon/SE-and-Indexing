<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new closure system for a heat
exchanger distributor which, by providing easy access to the
distributor interior while maintaining the sealed clamping of the
tube plate without the need for independent auxiliary seal
members, enables the dimensions of the distributor to be limited
with consequent reduction in manufacturing costs, and the down
times and hence the relative maintenance costs to be minimized.In the heat exchanger field there are many known devices for
sealedly clamping the tube plate against a suitable bearing
surface on the end of the heat exchanger shell via a gasket.In a widely used known device, said clamping is effected via the
cover of the distributor which is provided for this purpose with
both the adjustable device necessary to form the pressure seal for
the cover, and with the adjustable device necessary for clamping
the tube plate by the breech lock method.NL-A-8 300 397 in the name of Lummus Nederland N.V., which is the closest prior art document,
discloses a distributor
for heat exchangers ending with a distributor cover that comprises a central
door which must be opened together with the entire cover, when the tube plate
has to be inspected.EP-A-0 097 324 in the name of Belleli SpA discloses a distributor in which the
tube plate is assembled by segmented circumferential members in order to improve
the clamping of the tube plate.It is however always essential to be able to gain access to the
interior of the distributor in order to check the functional
clamping of the tube plate.This requirement has resulted in the use of an additional
adjustable device within the distributor to keep the tube plate 
clamped in the absence of the cover, with a consequent
obvious increase in the distributor length and cost.
In addition, access to the distributor interior depends
on removing the entire cover, which is not particularly
easy.The present invention seeks to obviate said
drawbacks by providing a closure system for a heat
exchanger distributor which enables said additional
internal adjustable member for clamping the tube place
to be eliminate, while still allowing easy access to
the distributor interior.According to the invention, there is provided a
closure system for the distributor of a heat exchanger
comprising inter alia a tube plate sealedly pressed via
a gasket against a bearing surface on the end of the
heat exchanger shell by a cylindrical presser operated
by an adjustment device in a distributor cover and
removable partition walls separated from said
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A closure system for the distributor of a heat
exchanger comprising inter alia a tube plate (3)

sealedly pressed via a gasket (4) against a bearing
surface (5) on the end (6) of the heat exchanger shell

by a cylindrical presser (8) operated by an adjustment
device (12) in a distributor cover (13) and removable

partition walls (17, 18) separated from said cover,
said cover (13) also being provided with an adjustable

device (14) for its sealed clamping through an annular

gasket (15) against said distributor characterised in
that said cover (13) is provided with a central

aperture (19) hermetically sealable by means of a door
(20), and said door (20) is connected to the cover

(13) by an independent sealing system constituted by a seal
gasket (23) and axial pressers (21), that can be

opened to gain access to the distributor interior
without altering the seal at the annular gaskets (4, 15)

of the tube plate (3) and of the cover (13),
respectively.
A closure system for the distributor of a heat
exchanger as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that

said door (20) for hermetically sealing said central
aperture (19) in the cover (13) is screwed into said

cover and is provided along its circumferential
periphery with a screwed series of position-adjustable

axial pressers (21) which press a diaphragm (22)
against an internal projection (24) provided on said

aperture, via the seal gasket (23). 
A closure system for the distributor of a heat
exchanger as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that

said door (20) for hermetically sealing said central
aperture (19) in the cover (13) is pressed against an

internal projection.
