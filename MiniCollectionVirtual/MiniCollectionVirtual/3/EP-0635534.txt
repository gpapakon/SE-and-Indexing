<ABSTRACT>
The organosilicon compounds contain at least one Si-C bonded organic radical containing at least one triazene group. The organosilicon compounds can be employed as thermo- and photolabile free-radical initiators for the preparation of homopolymers, graft copolymers and block copolymers from olefinically unsaturated compounds and for the crosslinking of organosilicon compounds and free-radical-polymerisable organic compounds.
