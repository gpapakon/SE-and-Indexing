<ABSTRACT>
Holograms and diffraction gratings are described wherein the presence of a "key-colour" (Magenta) permits an observer to identify the position where all the other colours of the hologram in question can be univocally determined. Two set of spectra (60 and 70) are provided such that at a predetermined angle (13) a reference beam of incident white-light (10) illuminating the hologram or diffractin grating composition will cause the observer (11) to see the color "Magenta" which is to be used as a reference "key-colour".

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the field of light
diffracting patterns, such as diffraction gratings and surface-relief
holograms. The invention is specifically directed, although
not restricted to, rainbow holograms and diffraction
gratings used to form decorative or graphic compositions,
wherein an image is formed of two or more colours by means of
contrasting areas of diffracted light. The invention is
directed to a method of using holographically generated
diffraction patterns or holograms with multiple spectral
colours wherein a "key-colour" (Magenta) is provided which
permits the identification of the correct viewing position from
which an observer must examine the image in order to see all
the other colours in they correct hues.Use of diffraction gratings to compose patterns and multicoloured
designs without the use of any conventional inks or
pigments has been described, for example US Patent 1,354,471
wherein jewellry, signs and other articles are decorated by
colours derived by the diffraction of incident white-light into
iridescent spectral colours. Light diffracting patterns such as
those described in the above said US Patent are formed by
mechanically ruling fine parallel lines into a suitable substrate,
the different combinations of shades and colours being 
attained by varying the number and direction of the lines. A
method of making diffraction gratings by optical means is described
in the US Patent 3,578,845 using two beams of coherent
light from a laser to form a holographic diffraction grating.The use of holographically formed diffraction gratings to
produce decorative patterns which may be embossed into plastic
is described by M.C.Hutley in the Spring 1979 issue of the
National Physical Laboratory Newsletter pages 6 - 7. By this
method a plurality of complimentary photographic masks are used
to form several surface-relief gratings in a photo-resist, to
produce the desired decorative pattern. A more elaborate method
is described in US Patent 4,629,282 wherein a rainbow hologram
(as disclosed in US Patent No. 3,633,989) is made of a
diffusing surface (such as a piece of ground glass) to produce
diffractive colour effects. A variation of this method is
described in US Patent No. 4.998,785 wherein the slit laser
transmission hologram is replaced by a lens array.In both these methods a diffraction grating is formed in a
photo-resist by means of the mutual interference of two or more
coherent monochromatic beams of light from a laser to provide a
surface relief pattern for

<CLAIMS>
Multi-colour hologram or diffractive composition (2) comprising a diffractive
portion which under white-light illumination (10) at a predetermined illumination

angle displays a reference colour, obtained by the overlapping of two diffraction
zones (60,70) of spectral dispersion at a different extreme ends of the visible

spectrum (63,71), which appears to the observer (11) only at the correct
viewing position simultaneously with a predetermined colour shown on the rest

of the hologram or diffractive composition.
Multi-colour hologram or diffractive composition (2) according to Claim 1
wherein said diffractive portion is

adapted such that once the reference colour is visible at the correct viewing position a slight tilting of the
hologram surface or a vertical displacement of the observer position or a

change of the angle of the illuminating radiation causes the sudden shifting of
the wave length generating the reference colour from the visible to the invisible

part of one of said spectral dispersions and therefore the reference colour disappears.
Multi-colour hologram or diffractive composition (2) according to claim 1
wherein the reference colour is obtained by the overlapping of two zones of the

spectral dispersion such that the position where the two zones overlap is at the
extreme end just prior to the infra-red of the visible spectrum (71) and the

extreme end just prior to the ultraviolet of the visible spectrum of the other zone
(63).
Multi-colour hologram or diffractive composition (2) according to claim 1, wherein said diffractive portion displaying the two zones of
spectral dispersion which overlap to form the reference colour has been produced by

the sequential double exposure of a reference beam (1) in conjunction with an
object beam (3) which is displaced by a predetermined amount between the

two consecutive exposure.
Use of multi-colour hologram or diffractive composition (2) according to Claim 1
for the authentication of documents, commercial products and goods.
