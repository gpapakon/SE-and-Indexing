<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a composition useful for 
producing a thick film resistor, and specifically to a 
composition using a ruthenium oxide as a conducting 
component. A thick film resistor composition widely used in 
thick film resistor electrical parts, thick film hybrid 
circuits, etc. are compositions for preparing a 
resistor thick film by printing the composition on a 
conductor pattern or electrodes formed on the surface of 
an insulating substrate, followed by calcining the 
print. The thick film resistor composition is prepared by 
dispersing a conducting component and an inorganic 
binder in an organic medium (vehicle). The conducting 
component plays a principal role of determining the 
electrical properties of the thick film resistor, and a 
ruthenium oxide or the like is used as this component. 
The inorganic binder comprises glass, and has a major 
role of retaining the thick film integrally and binding 
it to the substrate. The organic medium is a dispersing 
medium that affects the application properties, 
particularly rheology, of the composition. When a thick film resistor composition using a 
ruthenium oxide as the conducting component is to be 
used for a hybrid microelectronic circuit or a chip 
resistor, it is important that the electric stability of 
the resistor be high, and especially its electrostatic 
discharge {ESD) be small. This is of particular 
importance when the composition is to be put to vehicle 
uses, namely, ignition equipment on automobiles.  A considerably high voltage, e.g., 10-20 kV, as in 
a spark, may be applied to the circuit of the ignition 
equipment of an automobile. ESD serves as an indicator 
of the voltage endurance of the resistor against this 
high voltage. This parameter is expressed as % change 
in the value of resistance before and after the 
application of a static electricity of a certain 
voltage. So far, the ESD of the thick film resistor for 
automobiles is evaluated based on the values before and 
after the application of 5 kV. In recent years, 
however, voltage endurance under a higher voltage load 
such as 25 kV has been required. Thus, there has been a 
demand for a small ESD not only at 5 kV, but also at 
25 kV. The voltage endurance of the thick film resistor 
can be controlled to some extent by varying the 
proportion of the ruthenium oxide in the resistor. 
However, a desired resistance may not be obtained, or 
the surface condition of the calcined product may be 
deteriorated. To make up for this drawback, or to 
control voltage
