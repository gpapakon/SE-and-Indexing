<ABSTRACT>
A polarity reversing DC power inserter circuit (204) for other signal control apparatus used in a cable or community antenna television (CATV) signal distribution system. A power transformer circuit (210) receives a 117 volts AC power source at a subscriber's premise and converts it to a lower voltage positive and negative DC. A polar reversing circuit (204) comprising switching transistors (220, 221) and a 50 % duty cycle multivibrator (230) switches between the lower voltage DC at a frequency less than 10 Hz so as to avoid shock hazards associated with normal alternating current, while alternating sufficiently often to avoid electrolysis and corrosion problems associated with use of direct current (DC) a cable drop (115) to be provided uplink to the signal control apparatus. At the signal control apparatus, the polarity reversing DC is converted into DC by a power utilization circuit, and then utilized to power the signal control apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to power 
supply circuits, and more particularly relates to a polarity 
reversing DC power supply circuit for remotely located 
equipment, particularly usefuly for powering cable television 
signal control apparatus located remotely from and connected to a 
subscriber facility and primary power supply by a conductor such 
as a drop cable. Recent years have seen growing cable televsion 
industry interest in various types of off-premises signal control 
systems, such as interdiction systems for denying programming to 
cable or community antenna television (CATV) subscribers who 
have not purchased it. A number of concerns with such off-premises 
equipment revolve around the need for providing 
electrical power to the circuit. One concern is the cost burden to 
the cable system operator if the off-premises system is powered  
 
from the feeder or distribution cable, or the cost burden to the 
subscriber if powered from the subscriber's facility. Another 
concern is the compatibility of an off-premises system into an 
existing plant, since a retrofit of new equipment such as an 
interdiction system must be virtually transparent to subscribers. 
A third and primary concern is safety if power is being supplied 
from the subscriber's facility so as to ensure that no shock hazard 
will be created. The latter concern is especially important in 
cable television distribution systems for home viewing, since 
cable subscribers often connect and disconnect their own cable 
equipment such as VCR's, cable converters, and the like. Because of the increasing popularity and acceptance 
by cable system operators of signal control systems such as 
interdiction systems, there is a particular need for power circuits 
for powering off-premises cable television channel interdiction 
systems such as those shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,912,760 to 
West, Jr. et al., and 5,109,286 to West, Jr. et al., both owned by 
the assignee of the present application. In these systems, an off-premises 
cable television interdiction apparatus comprises a 
microprocessor actuation and control means for actuating and 
controlling a plurality of frequency agile voltage controlled 
oscillators. The voltage controlled oscillators selectively jam only 
unauthorized premium programming transmitted "in the clear" 
from a headend system to a particular subscriber. The 
interdiction system prevents the reception of jammed premium 
programming by the unauthorized subscriber. During the normal 
mode of operation, a
