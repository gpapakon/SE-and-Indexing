<ABSTRACT>
A boom (11) can be attached to a column (2) at any height and with variable inclination. A foot support (15, 16) is arranged displaceably on the boom and can be displaced along the boom (11) against the force of the pull cable (8). A loading unit (4) exerts an effect on the pull cable (8) and can be programmed by means of an operating device (21) in order to preselect the characteristics of the loading. Another boom can optionally be attached for arm exercises. A very wide variety of possible exercises can thus be selected with one apparatus, without its being necessary for any weights or mechanisms to be adjusted on the apparatus. Various booms (11) can be provided, by means of which the apparatus can be converted for various types of exercise, for example leg exercises, arm exercises or torso exercises.

<CLAIMS>
Strength or muscle training apparatus having engaging 
elements (15) being under load and movable against 

said load by muscular power, and a programmable unit (4, 
21) for the generation of said load, as well as at least 

two extension arms (11, 34), characterised in that said 
extension arms (11, 34) are selectively and mutually independently 

attachable in selected positions to a stand 
(2), and in that at least one driving element (8) is 

provided which is capable of being connected to an attached 
extension arm (11, 34) resp. to an engaging element 

(15). 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterised in 
that a common driving system (4, 5, 8) is provided for 

said extension arms (11, 34) or the engaging elements 
(15), respectively. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, characterised in 
that a common motor, preferably a direct current motor 

(5), acts upon the engaging element (15). 
Apparatus according to claim 3, characterised in 
that the motor (5) act
s by means of a traction cable (8) 
on the engaging element (15). 
Apparatus according to claim 4, characterised in 
that the motor (5) acts on a cable shaft (7) having a 

screw-shaped cable groove, and in that a tensioning 
element, e.g. a tensioning motor (37), always maintains 

tensioned the cable end running to or from, respectively, 
the cable shaft (7). 
Strength or muscle training apparatus according to 
one of claims 1 to 5, characterised by a column (2) on  

 
which the extension arms (11, 34) bearing said engaging 

element (15) are adjustably fastenable with respect to 
height and inclination. 
Apparatus according to claim 6, characterised in 
that it is provided with a first extension arm (11) having 

a displaceable foot holder (15), and with a second 
extension arm (34) for arm and body training. 
Apparatus according to claim 7, characterised in 
that said first extension arm (11) contains a supporting 

plate (13) for laying the extension arm down on a support 
such as chair or bed. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised by an operating device (21) which is adjustable 

in height, direction and inclination and thus 
is visisble from any training position whatsoever. 
Apparatus according to claims 6 and 9, characterised 
in that the operating device (21) is disposed on a 

stand (20) separated from said column (2) or a frame 
being usable in two positions is provided together with 

said operating device (21). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 6 to 10, 
characterised in that said programmable unit (4) is disposed 

at the upper end of said column (2) and is connected 
to said engaging element (15) via a deflecting roller 

(38) at the lower column end and at least one deflecting 
roller (19, 18, 36) on an extension arm (11, 

34). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 11, 
characterised by a microprocessor (43) for selecting and 

entering parameters and for controlling said programmable  
 

unit, by input keys (24 to 26) and a display (22), 
keys (24) being provided for selecting and displaying 

certain menus and keys (25, 26) allowing to adjust parameters 
such as force, force gradient, path or stroke, 

cycle time, cycle number and braking force. 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 12, 
characterised by a brake installation, e.g. a brake circuit 

allowing to supply a braking current to the unit 
(5), stop or reverse positions of the stroke of the engaging 

element (15) being determined by braking or relieving 
the unit (5). 
Apparatus according to claim 13, characterised by 
input means (25, 42, 43) for the stop or reversal positions 

which store these positions when actuated while 
the engaging element (15) has been brought to the desired 

position. 
Apparatus according to claim 14, characterised in 
that it further comprises and encoder (42) connected to 

said microprocessor (43) for determining and transmitting 
the position of the engaging element (15). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 15, 
characterised in that it further comprises a sound generator 

(47) and loudspeakers (48) for the acoustic monitoring 
of the movement of the engaging element (15). 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 1 to 16, 
characterised by means for storing certain programs, 

e.g. personal ones, these means being for example an 
interface for the connection of a personal computer (50) 

or of a pluggable memory key, or internal memories of 
the apparatus.  

 
Apparatus according to any one of claims 12 to 17, 
characterised in that it further comprises means for 

storing of at least one set value of a parameter, such 
as force, path or speed, and means for comparing the actual 

value obtained during training with the set value 
and for displaying and/or storing the difference between 

set and actual value or the relation between set and actual 
value.
