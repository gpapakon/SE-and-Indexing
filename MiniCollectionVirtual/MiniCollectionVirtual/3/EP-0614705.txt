<ABSTRACT>
A wave-receiving piezoelectric device (10) for use 
as, e.g., a hydrophone or a microphone, is constituted 

by a piezoelectric body (1) having two surfaces (1a,1b) 
sandwiching a thickness (t) and including at least one 

surface provided with a recess (including a 
perforation (4) communicating with the two surfaces) set 

in the thickness direction, and a rigid member (2,3) having 
a contact surface and an outer surface opposite to the 

contact surface and disposed to cover said at least 
one surface with the contact surface so as to make the 

recess (4) airtight. As a result, an acoustic pressure 
received by the outer surface is concentrat
ed and 
applied onto said at least one surface of the 

piezoelectric body, thereby giving an improved wave-receiving 
sensitivity at an enhanced acoustic 

pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wave-receiving 
(or passive) piezoelectric device having an 
enhanced sensitivity of receiving an acoustic wave. There have been known wave-receiving 
piezoelectric devices inclusive of a microphone which 
is generally placed in a gaseous medium such as air or 
a gas so as to receive an acoustic wave propagated 
through the gaseous medium, and a hydrophone which is 
generally placed in a liquid medium such as water or 
other liquids so as to receive an acoustic wave 
propagated through the liquid medium. The acoustic wave-receiving sensitivity of 
such a piezoelectric device may be expressed in terms 
of a hydrostatic piezoelectric constant dh in case 
where the device has a sufficiently smaller size than 
the wavelength of the acoustic wave, and is of course 
better if the dh constant is larger. Hitherto, the dh constant has been considered 
to be constant with respect to a piezoelectric 
material or body concerned which has been imparted 
with a piezoelectric property under a certain 
condition. There have been proposals 
for improving the dh constant through modification of 
a device structure so as to improve the sensitivity of  
 
the resultant piezoelectric device, see by example the 
Proceedings of the 6th IEEE International Symposium on Applications 
of Ferroelectrics ISAF '86, June 86, Bethlehem, PA, USA, pg. 273-276 
by M. Kahn et al. In particular, the combination of Fig.1 and 3 of this 
citation shows a device according to the preamble of claim 1.  
 An object of the present invention is to 
realize a wave-receiving piezoelectric device having a 
higher sensitivity from a given piezoelectric 
material. According to our study, it has been found 
possible to produce a piezoelectric device having a 
significantly enhanced wave-receiving sensitivity from 
a given piezoelectric body by providing a surface of 
the body with a recess in a sense of including a 
perforation through its thickness by surface-embossing 
or boring, and covering the surface with a rigid 
member so that an acoustic pressure received by the 
outer surface of the rigid member is concentrated and 
applied onto the surface of the piezoelectric body. Thus, according to the present invention, 
there is provided a wave-receiving piezoelectric 
device, comprising: 
a piezoelectric body having two surfaces 
sandwiching a thickness and including at least one 
surface provided with a recess set in the thickness 
direction, and a rigid member having a contact surface and 
an outer surface opposite to
