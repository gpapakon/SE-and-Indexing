<ABSTRACT>
A titanium alloy cable comprises a plurality of individual wire filaments (20). Groups of wire filaments are twisted together in a first helical direction around a central wire filament to make a strand (10). A plurality of strands are twisted together in a second helical direction around a core strand to make a strong, flexible cable. The first helical direction has the opposite sense to that of the second helical direction. In one embodiment, the cable has one hundred and thirty three wire filaments, each of diameter 0.0025 inches (64(my)m), arranged in nineteen equivalent strands and the titamium alloy is Ti-6 wt % A1-4 wt % V.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METAL CABLEThe present invention relates to a metal cable and, in particular, to a cable for use in surgical procedures.A number of surgical techniques have been developed over recent years which involve the fastening of loops of wire around bony structures. Some of these procedures are, for example, concerned with the stabilising of certain types of fracture but others may involve the lashing of various types of prosthesis or like device to the skeleton. Examples of such procedures and of devices to be used in them are to be found in US Patents 4,604,995 (Stephens et al.), 2,501,978 (Wichman) and 4,790,303 (Steffee).Traditionally, a stiff stainless steel wire filament is moulded into a shape and pulled or pushed around the bone. The stiff wire is fastened by tightening together the free ends of the wire as described for example in U.S. patents 2,455,609 (Scheib), 1,304,620 (Steinkoenig) and 914,182 (Pfeffer). Basically, a mechanical operation simultaneously tightens and fastens the loop.The use of this stiff wire is not ideal since it may cause serious and irreparable damage to the underlying soft tissues, and for this reason a more flexible cable would be preferable.During the surgical procedure a great deal of strain is placed on the wire which may be sufficient to cause the wire to deform plastically. If this happens the structures, which should have been held firmly by the wire loop, may still be able to move relative to one another. In addition, the high strain may weaken the wire to such an extent that it subsequently breaks after the operation has been completed and the wound closed. This could easily produce sharp wire ends which may protrude into, and cause serious damage to, the surrounding tissues. In either event, if the high strains damage the wire irrevocably, the entire procedure will have to be repeated.The problems associated with a metal wire filament may, at first sight, be obviated by the selection of alternative 

 non-metallic materials for the filament. For example, polymers or fibre reinforced composites might seem particularly suitable because of the way in which they have been successfully applied to a large number of other situations. However, polymers are prone to stretching, and fibres have a tendency to splinter. Neither of these characteristics are acceptable in this particular application. Instead, a wire cable comprising filaments of surgical grade stainless steel, a material which is compatible with human tissue, has been preferred, see US patent 4,790,303
