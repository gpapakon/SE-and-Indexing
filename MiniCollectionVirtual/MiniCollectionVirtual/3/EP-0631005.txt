<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cloth for ink-jet 
printing deposited with a water-insoluble water-absorbing 

resin having a water absorption capability of 50 to 1,000 
ml/g, and an ink-jet printing process comprising the 

steps of providing the printing cloth with a printing ink 
by an ink-jet process, plus heating and fixing, and 

cleaning. 
The cloth for ink-jet printing of the invention 
can be printed at high reproducibility, with excellent 

sharpness and build-up of the printing image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cloth capable 
of obtaining a printing image of excellent sharpness and 
build-up by applying printing ink by an ink-jet process, 
and an ink-jet printing processing using the same cloth. Recently, in the printing field, pattern printing 
by the ink-jet process has been developed. That is, in 
this method, the original pattern is read by the sensor, 
and is processed by computer and converted into an 
electric signal, and the printing solution containing dye 
is discharged from the ink-jet nozzle to print on the 
cloth. It was, however, a serious problem that a sharp 
and favorable printing image could not be obtained 
because, in the ink-jet printing process, blurring or 
running of ink occurs when the printing ink is applied on 
the cloth, and thus the resolution is lowered. A method 
is proposed, for example, to solve these problems, in 
which the cloth is pretreated with a compound 
substantially not dyeable with the ink to be used,  
 
selected from a group consisting of water soluble polymer, 
water soluble salts, and water insoluble inorganic fine 
powder; ink-jet printing is then performed (Japanese 
Patent Publication No. 31594/1988). When printing, the ink and printing condition 
suitable for the type of fiber of the cloth used in 
printing must be adjusted carefully. In the above-mentioned 
proposed prior arts, however, it is very 
difficult to print with superior sharpness, build-up and 
reproducibility in ink-jet printing of various fibers. It is hence a primary object of the invention to 
provide a cloth for ink-jet printing capable of printing 
with favorable reproducibility and excellent sharpness and 
build-up. It is another
 
object of the invention to introduce an ink-jet printing 
process providing excellent sharpness and build-up. Those objects have been achieved by the surprising 
finding that the improved printing as
 
mentioned above is possible by using a specific water-insoluble 
water-absorbing resin. More specifically, the invention relates to a  
 
cloth for ink-jet printing, wherein 0.01 to 10 % by weight 
of a water-insoluble water-absorbing resin having a water 
absorption capability of 50 to 1,000 ml/g to purified 
water is deposited on said cloth; and an ink-jet printing 
process of cloth comprising the steps of depositing 0.01 
to 10 wt.% of the the above mentioned water-insoluble 
water-absorbing resin to the cloth, applying printing ink 
by the ink-jet process, heating and fixing the printing 
ink, and washing and removing the
