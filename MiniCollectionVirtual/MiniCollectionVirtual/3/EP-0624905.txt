<ABSTRACT>
A function module using technology which allows conductive vias to 
be formed in a silicon substrate in order to fabricate three dimensional 

multifunctional processor system is described. A silicon or other 
semiconductor carrier having embedded active devices therein is used as a 

substrate for complex functional elements disposed on both sides thereof. 
The semiconductor substrate includes conductive vias formed therein which 

interconnect single chips or multichip modules disposed on either side 
thereof. Using drilling/plating techniques for wafer substrates 

electrically interconnected devices are placed on opposite sides of the 
substrate. Multichip modules (MCM) including the desired functions are 

then fabricated having input/output (I/Os) connection points which 
correspond to the vias formed in the substrate. This interconnection 

between the MCMs and the substrate may be accomplished by providing 
circuitized lines and connection pads on a dielectric layer, with 

conductive vias therein, which is subsequently placed on the active 
substrate. A dielectric layer having circuitized lines therein can then 

be extended outwardly from the module in order to provide electrical 
connection to input output devices, e.g. keyboard, display, or the like, 

as well as other system components, such as like multifunctional 
elements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multichip module for providing 
processing operations in a computer system. Conventionally, multiprocessor systems utilize separate and 
distinct functional units, such as a multichip module with a substrate 
carrier for the processors, a memory adapter card, e.g. single in line 
memory module (SIMM), and a separated module for a switching element 
which allows the processors to communicate with the memory. These discrete functional units each require a substantial amount 
of volume in a computer system and also present data transmission 
problems, since at least some of the interconnecting lines will be long, 
increasing time of flight of data to levels not commensurate with 
performance requirements of the machine. Alternatively, a processor 
placed on one side of a card, away from the memory unit, will have longer 
line lengths to a memory chip than those of a processor mounted near the 
memory. In order to prevent data timing skew associated with these 
variations in line length, all of the critical wiring paths in 
conventional systems are designed to be the same length. Thus, the line 
length is dependent on the length of the longest line and hence system 
performance suffers. Multichip modules, which are known in the art, allow whole computer 
functions to be placed on a single module, which can in turn be attached 
to a computer planar, by a connector, or directly with solder ball 
connect (SBC) technologies, or the like. These multichip modules include 
integrated circuit devices on at least one side of a passive substrate 
carrier, such as a dielectric material having wiring layers therein. The 
wiring layers in the substrate only provide the electrical 
interconnection required between the various chips disposed on either 
side of the substrate. Thus, it can be seen that conventional multichip 
modules are a plurality of integrated circuit devices wired together 
through a supporting passive substrate. It is known to use silicon wafers as substrate material, 
particularly to solve the problem of matching the thermal coefficient of 
expansion between the substrate and the chips. US patent 5,039,628 
describes a multichip module wherein a silicon material can be used as a  
 
carrier for integrated circuit devices. A preferred carrier material 
will have a thermal coefficient of expansion to match the mounted chips. 
It is also noted that vias are formed through the carrier material. US 
4,956,695 is a three dimensional chip package wherein plural ICs, having
