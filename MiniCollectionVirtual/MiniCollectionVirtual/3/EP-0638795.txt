<ABSTRACT>
The occurrence and location of a disturbance (22) in the vicinity of a 
localized portion of an optical fiber (18) are determined based on the recognition that 

such a disturbance changes the polarization condition of signals backscattered from 
the disturbed portion. Thus, multiple consistently polarized optical pulses (from 12, 

14) are applied to an input end of the fiber, and only signals (from 28) of a particular 
polarization that are backscattered from the disturbed portion are abstracted from the 

input end. An output signal (from 36) indicative of the disturbance is generated by 
processing these backscattered signals in accordance with synchronous detection 

techniques (by 32, 34).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and method for
sensing the occurrence of a cyclic disturbance in the vicinity
of a localised portion of an optical fibre, and to apparatus
for remotely sensing the occurrence and determining the location
of a cyclic disturbance in the vicinity of a localized
portion of an optical fiber.As the use of optical fibers in communications systems continues to grow, it
is becoming increasingly important that reliable low-cost techniques be available for
monitoring the condition of the fibers. Thus, for example, during installation of a
fiber, testing is carried out to ensure that splices and connectors have low loss, that
excessive losses have not been introduced due to bending or stressing of the fiber, and
that the total end-to-end loss of the fiber is within prescribed specifications. Further,
during actual operation of an installed fiber, regular checking is typically carried out
to determine whether or not some degradation in the condition of the fiber has
occurred. And, if the fiber is found to be impaired (accidentally cut, for example) it
is important to be able to quickly and inexpensively ascertain the location of the
impairment.It is well known that information concerning the condition of an optical fiber
can be obtained by repetitively launching optical pulses into one end of the fiber and
then analyzing light that is backscattered from the fiber. This conventional single-ended
technique, known as optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR), is well
established as a useful tool for monitoring optical fiber networks.Standard OTDR techniques make use of the information contained in the
overall intensity of the backscattered light from an optical fiber to locate, for example,
bad fiber-to-fiber joints and anomalously lossy sections of the fiber. It has also been
recognized that there are many external influences (magnetic field, electric field, stress,
strain, temperature, etc.) which act to change the polarization state of the light
propagating in the fiber. Polarization state can be determined with an OTDR system
modified to be polarization sensitive. (See, for example, "Polarization-Optical Time
Domain Reflectometry: A Technique for the Measurement of Field Distributions", by
A.J. Rogers, AppliedOptics, Vol. 20, No. 6, pages 1060-1074, March 15, 1981.) In 
general, the detected backscattered signal is very faint, and monitoring techniques
based on OTDR or on polarization-sensitive OTDR (POTDR) require extensive time-averaging
to produce a result.Heretofore,
