<ABSTRACT>
For the subgrade-rehabilitation of a ballast bed (10) of a track (9), old ballast (6) of the ballast bed is continuously removed to clear a track formation (51), formation fine gravel (51) is released onto the cleared track formation and compacted to form a formation-protecting layer (43). Some of the old ballast (6) of the ballast bed is broken up in a stone crusher device (3) and released onto the cleared track formation (51) to form the formation-protecting layer (43).

A method for subgrade rehabilitation of a ballast bed 
(10) of a track (9), wherein old ballast (6) of the ballast 

bed is continuously removed, thereby exposing an earth 
formation (51), and a gravel-sand mixture (55) is discharged 

upon the exposed earth formation and compacted for forming a 
formation protection layer (43), characterized in that at 

least a portion of the old ballast (6) of the ballast bed is 
comminuted and discharged upon the exposed earth formation to 

form at least part of the formation protection layer (43). 
A method according to claim 1, characterized in that a 
portion of the old ballast is comminuted, mixed with sand and, 

for forming the formation protection layer, is discharged upon 
the earth formation exposed after removal of the remaining old 

ballast. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that new ballast is discharged upon the graded and compacted 

formation protection layer. 
A method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, characterized in 
that the old ballast is cleaned before being comminuted. 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that after the removal of a portion of the old ballast for 

comminution, the remaining old ballast is scraped off, thereby 
producing an earth formation, and deposited at the shoulders 

of the earth formation (51). 
A method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that before comminution of the old ballast, undersized 

ballast stones are screened out therefrom and discharged upon 
the exposed earth formation (51).  

 
An arrangement for subgrade rehabilitation of the ballast 
bed of a track, comprising conveyor belt arrangements for 

transporting old ballast or a gravel-sand mixture for a 
formation protection layer, for implementing the method 

according to claim 1, characterized by a rock crushing 
apparatus (3) situated on a machine frame (2) having on-track 

undercarriages (8), a first conveyor belt arrangement (18) 
for transporting the old ballast (6) being associated with a 

charging opening (16) of the rock crushing apparatus (3), 
while a receiving end (19) of a second conveyor belt 

arrangement (20), extending in the longitudinal direction 
of the machine frame (2), for transporting away ballast 

comminuted to form a gravel-sand mixture is associated with a 
discharge opening (17) of the rock crushing apparatus (3). 
An arrangement according to claim 7, characterized in 
that a clearing device (5) for continuously taking up the 

old ballast from the ballast bed (10) is associated with a 
receiving end (33) of the first conveyor belt arrangement 

(18) for transporting the old ballast (6). 
An arrangement according to claim 8, characterized in 
that the clearing device (5) connected to the rock crushing 

apparatus (3) via the first conveyor belt arrangement (18) 
is followed - as seen in the working direction of the 

arrangement (1) - by a main clearing device (7), vertically 
adjustable by means of drives (29), for removal of the 

remaining old ballast (6). 
An arrangement according to claim 9, characterized in 
that a third conveyor belt arrangement (25) is associated 

with the main clearing device (7) for transporting away the 
old ballast (6) taken up, the discharge end (24) of said 

third conveyor belt arrangement (25) being provided at one of 
the two ends of the arrangement (1).  

 
An arrangement according to one of claims 7 to 10, 
characterized in that the machine frame (2) connected to the 

rock crushing apparatus (3) is coupled to a further machine 
frame (4) which is connected to the two clearing devices 

(5,7) between two on-track undercarriages (8) arranged at the 
ends. 
An arrangement according to one of claims 7 to 11, 
characterized in that a common hopper (39) is associated with 

a discharge end (36) of the second conveyor belt arrangement 
(20) for transporting away the comminuted ballast and with a 

discharge end (37) of a fourth conveyor belt arrangement (38) 
for transporting sand. 
An arrangement according to claim 12, characterized in 
that the hopper (39) is arranged above a pivoting conveyor 

belt (41), mounted on the machine frame (4) for pivoting 
about a vertical axis (40), the discharge end of which is 

positioned immediately preceding, in the working direction of 
the arrangement (1), a grading and compacting device (42) for 

the formation protection layer (43). 
An arrangement according to claim 12 or 13, characterized 
in that a receiving end (44) of the fourth conveyor belt 

arrangement (38) provided for transporting sand is provided 
at the rear end of the machine frame (4) in the working 

direction of the arrangement (1). 
An arrangement according to one of claims 7 to 14, 
characterized in that a screening unit (34) having a 

vibratory drive (35) is arranged between the receiving end 
(33) of the first conveyor belt arrangement (18) and a 

discharge end (32) of the clearing device (5). 
An arrangement according to one of claims 7 to 15, 
characterized in that a screening unit (23) having a  

 
vibratory drive (22) is provided between the charging opening 

(16) of the rock crushing apparatus (3) and the discharge end 
(21) of the first conveyor belt arrangement (18).
