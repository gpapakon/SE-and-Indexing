<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an ATM local network with a plurality of stations (1 to 4) which are in each case coupled with transceiver ring connections (17, 20) via a network interface (5 to 8) containing a coupling device (12) and a control arrangement (25) and which are provided for the transmission of user cells containing user-specific information and control cells containing at least signalling information. Having received a control cell supplied by the transmitting station and containing an executable request for a single or multiple connection of a user of the transmitting station with a user of at least one receiving station, the control arrangement (25) assigned to a transmitting station is provided to generate at least one control cell which is to be sent to a receiving station and which contains in its information field at least information on the users, the address of the transmitting station and a user-specific identifier for a return connection. Having received a control cell supplied by the transmitting station and containing an executable connection request of a user of the receiving station, at least one control arrangement (25) assigned to a transmitting station is provided to generate a control cell which is to be sent to the transmitting station and which contains in its information field at least information on the address of the assigned receiving station and a user-specific identifier for the forward connection.
