<ABSTRACT>
A double-wall crucible is disclosed which is 
constructed by coaxially disposing a cylindrical 

partition wall in an outer crucible for holding a molten 
mass of silicon as a raw material and operated by 

heating the outer crucible and meanwhile supplying the 
raw material silicon to the gap between the outer 

crucible and the cylindrical partition wall and 
introducing the consequently produced molten mass of 

silicon to the interior of the cylindrical partition 
wall through a passage below the level of the molten 

mass of silicon interconnecting the outer crucible and 
the inner side of the cylindrical partition wall and 

meanwhile pulling a single crystal bar from the molten 
mass of silicon in the cylindrical partition wall. In 

this double-wall crucible, at least the cylindrical 
partition wall is formed of quartz glass having a 

hydroxyl group (OH group) content of not more than 30 ppm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a double-wall crucible to 
be used in pulling a silicon single crystal. Heretofore, the Czochralski method has been 
prevalently adopted for the operation of pulling a 
silicon single crystal. As a version developed from this method, the method 
which adopts a double-wall crucible formed by disposing 
a cylindrical partition wall in an outer crucible and 
operates the crucible by supplying solid (particulate 
or granular) or fused silicon as a raw material 
batchwise or continuously into the crucible through a 
gap between the inner surface of the outer crucible and 
the outer surface of the cylindrical partition wall and 
pulling a silicon single crystal from the molten mass 
of silicon in the cylindrical partition wall has been 
arresting attention. This pulling method is expected to serve not only 
as means for uniformizing the concentration of such a 
doping impurity as boron, antimony, or phosphorus in a 
silicon single crystal being pulled for the sake of 
precluding the resistivity of the single crystal bar 
from being altered by the possible segregation of the 
impurity mentioned above but also as means for improving  
 
the productivity of the operation and enhancing the 
yield thereof and consequently lowering the cost of 
production by pulling the single crystal bar while 
continuing the supply of raw material. A typical example of the construction of the 
double-wall crucible 1 of this invention is illustrated 
in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. An outer crucible 3 by nature is fated to support a 
very heavy and hot molten mass 21 of silicon at all 
times. In order to prevent the outer crucible 3 from 
sustaining any thermal deformation or damage and, even 
if the damage should occur, preclude the molten mass 21 
from leaking out of the apparatus for pulling a single 
crystal, the into crucible 3 is protected by a 
container 2 made of graphite. A cylindrical partition wall 5 or 12 which is a 
cylindrical container disposed coaxially inside the 
outer crucible 3 is generally manufactured in a 
cylindrical form. The cylindrical partition wall 5, as 
cylindrical form. The is so constructed that the 5, as 
illustrated in Fig. 1, is so constructed that the lower 
end part thereof is not fixed to the inner bottom wall 
of the outer crucible 3 but is suspended in the molten 
silicon. The cylindrical partition wall 12, as 
illustrated in Fig. 2, is so constructed that the lower 
end part thereof is fused to the outer crucible 3 and 
the partition wall 12 proper is provided in the lower

disposing a cylindrical partition wall inside an outer 

crucible for holding a molten mass of silicon as a raw 
material and operated by heating said outer crucible and
