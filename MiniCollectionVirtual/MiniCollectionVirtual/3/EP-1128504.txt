This application is based on and hereby claims priority to Japanese Application No.
046467 filed on February 23, 2000 in Japan, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by
reference.Wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) amplifiers amplify optical signals that are
composites of multiple wavelength optical signals. WDM optical comimmications systems
relay multi-wavelength composite optical signals through multiple optical amplifiers.The band over which losses are low in optical fiber transmission circuits (less than
approximately 0.3 dB/km) is the band from 1450 nm to 1650 nm. As shown in Figure 1, a
variety of optical fiber amplification devices have been developed for this transmission band.At present, with the popularity of cellular telephones and the rapid increase in internet
use, the demand for telecommunications capacity is expanding explosively. There are global
intense research and development efforts for technologies that can increase the information
transmission capacity on a single fiber.Optical wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) technology that uses the broadband
characteristics of optical fiber amplifiers having silica erbium-doped fibers (EDF) is critical. 
The conventional wavelength band is known as both "the 1550 mn band" (1530 to 1560 nm) or
"the C band" (conventional-wavelength band).In addition, EDF optical amplifier equipment for a 1580 nm band (1570 to 1600 nm)
"the L band"(longer-wavelength band) has been developed. The competition has become
intense in developing a commercial optical fiber telecommunications system that is able to
transmit an ultra large capacity (perhaps 1.6 terabit/s) of information by modulating each
multiplexed wavelength at 10 Gb/s with about 80 waves in each of the bands for a total
composite of 160 waves.Because there is a capacity of approximately eight THz when C band and L band are
combined, when 10 Gb/s transmission signal channels are established with the 2.5 GHz
spacing, the overall transmission capacity of 1.6 terabit can be expanded further up to 3.2 Tb/s
(10 Gb/s Ã— 8,000 GHz25 GHz)On the other hand, there is demand for even greater carrying capacity, and so optical
fiber amplification devices that have new optical amplification bands, in addition to the current
C band and L band, are required.In Figure 1, even though GS-TDFA (gain-shifted thulium-doped fluoride-based fiber
amplifiers) are being developed for amplification in the S band region from 1490 nm to 1530
nm, GS-TDFA devices have a gain in the region between 1475 and 1510 nm, and
