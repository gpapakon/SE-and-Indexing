<ABSTRACT>
A liquid crystal projection device includes a light source (12), a polymer 
dispersed liquid crystal panel (11) for forming an optical image as a 

function of change in light scattering condition, a polarizing plate (17) 
disposed on at least one of incident 

and exit sides of the liquid crystal panel with respect to the direction of travel of 
light, and a projection lens (16) for projecting the optical image onto 

a polarizing screen (18). 
The polarizing plate (17) is removably and rotatably supported so that, by rotating the 

polarizing plate, the direction of the axis of polarization of the polarizing plate can 
be substantially aligned with the direction of the axis of the polarizing 

screen (18). The 
polarizing screen is utilized when the polarizing plate is mounted, but a non-polarizing 

screen may be utilized when the polarizing plate is not used, i.e., 
removed. Where the polarizing plates is used on both of the incident and exit sides 

of the panel, the direction of the axis of polarization of the polarizing plate on the 
incident side is to be substantially aligned with that of the polarizing pl
ate on the 
exit side.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid crystal display device utilizing
a liquid crystal panel capable of forming an optical image as a function of change
in light scattering condition, and also to a liquid crystal projection device for
projecting the optical image formed on the liquid crystal panel, onto a screen to
provide the image on an enlarged scale.A large-format image presentation such as, for example, in a home
theater or in a panel discussion has now come to be popular. While projection
devices utilizing a light valve have been available in various types, a recent
development is a liquid crystal projection device operable to project an image,
formed on a compact liquid crystal panel, onto a screen to thereby provide a large-format
image.The liquid crystal panel provides an image display by essentially
electrically varying an optical characteristic of the liquid crystal panel and operates
on a number of principles. The twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal panel generally
employed in the liquid crystal projection device currently available in the market
makes use of a phenomenon in which the rotatory polarization of liquid crystal
material varies in the presence of an electric field. This TN liquid crystal panel
requires the use of two polarizing plate to be disposed on or adjacent opposite
surfaces, that is, light incident and exit surfaces, of the liquid crystal panel and, for
this reason, the TN liquid crystal panel has a problem in that the efficiency of
utilization of light is low.On the other hand, as a method of controlling light with no polarizing
plate used, a method utilizing a scattering phenomenon is known. The liquid crystal
panel capable of forming an optical image by the utilization of change in light
scattering condition is available in three models which utilize a phase-changeable 
liquid crystal material, a dynamic scattering liquid crystal material and a polymer
dispersed liquid crystal material, respectively. Of them, the polymer dispersed
liquid crystal panel such as disclosed in the United States Patent No. 4,435,047 is
extensively studied because it gives rise to a bright image display.The display panel of a type utilizing the polymer dispersed liquid crystal
material does neither requires the use of any polarizing plate nor any orientation
treatment. In the TN liquid crystal display panel, light lost by the polarizing plates
are absorbed by the polarizing plates and converted into heat which would eventually
elevate the temperature of not only the polarizing plates, but
