<ABSTRACT>
The device includes two axisymmetric containers (1, 2) joined together so that they can rotate one relative to the other while not being capable of moving axially one relative to the other, one (1) of the containers, termed upper container, being open at one end and at its other end bearing dispensing means, and the other container (2), termed lower container, including a body (27) equipped with an end and closed by a lid (21) constituting an edge for the upper container (1) when the two containers are joined together. The lid (21) is made of metal and includes a pre-cut strip designed to be cut off through a tearing operation carried out by virtue of a tearing means (36-37) integral with the upper container (1), the said tearing operation being produced when the upper container (1) and the lower container (2) are subjected to a movement of relative rotation of one relative to the other.

A device for packaging and dispensing a mixture of two 
products separated from one another before the dispensing operation, 

such a device comprising two containers (1, 2) of revolution 
joined in such a way that they are capable of rotating relative 

to one another while not being axially displaceable relative 
to one another, one (1) of the containers, called the upper 

container, being open at one end and carrying at its other end 
dispensing means (42), the other container (2), called the lower 

container, comprising a body (27) provided with a bottom and 
closed by a cover (21), the said cover (21) of the lower container 

(2) constituting a bottom for the upper container (1) 
when the two containers are assembled, each of the containers 

then containing one of the products thus separated from one another, 
characterized in that the cover (21) of the lower container 

(2) is metallic and comprises a prescored strip (22) 
adapted to be cut out by a tearing operation effected by means 

of a tearing means (36-37) joined to the upper container (1), 
the said tearing operation being produced when the upper container 

(1) and the lower container (2) are subjected to a rotational 
movement relative to one another. 
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that an intermediate 
ring (3) is provided for the assembly of the upper 

container (1) and lower container (2). 
A device according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
ring (3) is provided with upper means (32) and lower means (34) 

for an axial assembly, and with upper sealing means (31) and 
lower sealing means (35) to be joined in a leakproof manner respectively 

to the upper container (1) and the lower container 
(2), the said ring (3) being prevented from rotating relative to 

the upper container (1) and free to rotate relative to the lower 
container (2).  

 
A device according to one of claims 2 or 3, characterized 
in that the tearing means (36-37) is carried by the ring (3). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that the prescored strip (22) included in the cover (21) of 

the lower container (2) carries at one of its ends a ring (26) 
extending in a plane parallel to a radius of the cover (21) of 

the lower container (2) and forming an angle with the plane of 
the said cover (21), the tearing means (36-37) comprising a 

finger (37) which extends in a substantially orthogonal manner 
relative to the common axis of the two containers, the upper (1) 

and the lower (2), the ring (26) and the finger (37) being disposed 
radially and axially in such a way that, for at least one 

relative angular position of the two containers, the finger (37) 
passes through the ring (26). 
A device according to claim 5, characterized in that the 
finger (37) is carried by a support (36) against which the ring 

(26) is capable of abutting when the two containers are rotated 
relative to one another. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the body (27) of the lower container (2) is metallic, 

and the cover (21) and the body (27) of the lower container (2) 
are joined by crimping. 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the dispensing means (42) carried by the upper container 

(1) are provided on a stopper (4) mounted on a neck (11) possessed 
by the upper container (1), and are provided with an obturator 

(5). 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterized 
in that the dispensing means carried by the upper container (1) 

are arranged in a tapered and closed end of the upper container 
(1), the said tapered end terminating in an easily frangible 

tip.  
 
A device according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterized 
in that the product contained in the upper container (1) is a 

liquid and the product contained in the lower container (2) is a 
paste.
