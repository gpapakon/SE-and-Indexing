<ABSTRACT>
Improved supersweet corn plants, in addition to their naturally occurring homozygous recessive sh-2 or bt-2 genes, also have an ADP-GPP subunit gene under the control of a heterologous promoter. The heterologous promoter may either be developmentally delayed so that it is active only after approximately 25 or 30 days post pollination, or it may be an inducible promoter. The improved kernels are supersweet when harvested for food, but are starchy when harvested as a seed crop. Alternatively an anti-sense ADP-GPP subunit gene under the control of an inducible promoter or a promoter which is active during early endosperm development may be used to transform a sweet corn plant such that transcription of the anti-sense gene blocks ADP-GPP synthesis giving rise to supersweet kernels.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVED SUPERSWEET CORNFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to plant biotechnology and specifically to corn, alternatively novn as maize, Zea mays or Indian corn. In particular the invention relates to supersweet corn with improved qualities, methods of producing the improved supersweet corn, vectors for the genetic engineering of the corn, DNA used to transform corn, and genomic clones containing the desired DNA.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe endosperm is a major site of starch deposition during maize kernel development. Many genetic loci affecting carbohydrate metabolism are known and some have been biochemically characterized. When some of these genes are not expressed, the result is generally a decrease in starch biosynthesis and a concomitant accumulation of sucrose to give a seed product commonly referred to as sweet corn and used as a human food product. Corn in which the levels of starch biosynthesis are normal is commonly referred to as field corn, and is often used for animal feed.Some of the genes involved in sweet corn production are Su (sugary-1), Sh-2 (shrunken-2) and Bt-2 (brittle-2). Sweet corn results from the presence of a homozygous recessive allele at the sugary-1 locus on chromosome 4, designated su. When su is present, there is a 3-5 fold increase in the percentage of sucrose (dry weight) relative to wild-type Su lines. The Sh-2 and Bt-2 genes, both involved in starch production, encode subunits of the enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (ADP-GPP) 

 (Î±_D-glucose-l-phosphate adenyl transferase, EC 2.7.7.27).ADP-GPP catalyzes the reversible synthesis of ADP-glucose and pyrophosphate from ATP and glucose-1-phosphate. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is unity and the reaction is driven by pyrophosphate hydrolysis. ADP-glucose is the glucosyl donor for starch chain elongation catalysed by starch synthetase. ADP-GPP is made up of four subunits: two subunits of a 60 kDa polypeptide encoded by the Sh-2 gene (hereinafter referred to as the Sh-2 protein), and two subunits of a 55 kDa polypeptide encoded by the Bt-2 gene (hereinafter referred to as the Bt-2 protein). When either the Sh-2 or Bt-2 gene is present in the homozygous recessive condition (designated sh-2 or bt-2 respectively), the 60 kDa or the 55 kDa subunits (respectively) are not properly synthesized, and little or no functional ADP-GPP is made. As a result, starch synthesis is impaired, sucrose accumulates to 2-4 times the levels of normal sweet corn, and the corn is "supersweet".While supersweet corn is
