<ABSTRACT>
For the provision of a guard (4,5), in particular a dress 
guard, which can be placed easily on a bicycle and which is 

adaptable to any radius of curvature of a mudguard edge (3) of 
a bicycle, and which is or can be provided with retaining 

means (15,16) which grip around the mudguard edge (3), the guard (4,5) is 
characterized in that it comprises two rounded-off 

triangular guard parts (4,5), each with a first side (7,8) which has a 
radius of curvature essentially adapted to the mudguard 

edge (3), and a second side (9,10) and a third side (11,12) 
which enclose an 

angle with a vertex (13,14), which guard parts (4,5) together at or near 
their vertices (13,14) can be fixed on the vertical rear fork (2) by 

means of a clamping part (18) in such a way that, on the one 
hand, the two sides (9,10) of the two guard parts (4,5) facing each 

other can form a variable opening (17) for a handbrake or a 
bicycle lock and that, on the other hand, the retaining 

means (15,16) can be brought into engagement with the mudguard edge 
at or near the first sides.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a guard to be
fixed against a mudguard of a bicycle or the like and
having an at least approximately arcuate edge which is
essentially adapted to the radius of curvature of the
outside edge of the mudguard and is or can be provided with
retaining means which grip around the mudguard edge.Such a guard is known from, for example, Dutch
Patent Application 8802206, which has been laid open for
inspection, and which discloses a guard which is bounded by
at least two different arcuate edges and has at the edges a
hole for allowing through a handbrake or lock fixed to the
vertical rear fork. The arcs of the edges correspond to the
different arcs of the mudguard edges which are used for
bicycles and are appropriate for a particular wheel
diameter. This known guard is thus suitable for fixing to
mudguards with different radii of curvature.A drawback of such a design of a guard is that when
it is being placed on a bicycle the correct radius of
curvature has to be sought, which can certainly be a
problem for the unskilled person, and that the means for
retaining the dress guard on the mudguard then either have
to be disposed on all suitable edges thereof, or
subsequently have to be fixed thereto. If there are
deviations in the mudguards, for example due to damage or
warping, a good fit becomes very difficult. The holes also
have to be relatively large at one edge, in order to allow
sufficient space for a lock and a handbrake to pass
through, with the result that the rigidity of the guard is
reduced.Another aesthetic drawback of such a design is that
in the case of bicycles without a lock and/or handbrake the
guard fixed on this bicycle therefore has a relatively
large unused hole. The German patent DE-C-850 403, which forms the basis
for the preamble of claim 1, discloses a guard comprising
two rounded-off triangular guard parts. Each guard part has
a curved first side, and a straight second and third side
which enclose an angle with a vertex. By moving the guards
parts tangentially an variable opening can be formed between
them, which opening could be used for a lock. A
drawback of this known dress guard is that said variable
opening would then extend as a triangle from the mud guard
to the rear wheel hub, which impaires the effectiveness of
the dress guard. The object of the invention is to provide a guard
which is suitable for fixing in a simple manner to
mudguards with different radii of curvature, and which
avoids the abovementioned drawbacks. This object is achieved by the

<CLAIMS>
Guard to be fixed against a mudguard (1) of a bicycle
or the like and having an at least approximately arcuate

edge which is essentially adapted to the radius of
curvature of the outside edge of the mudguard (1) and is or can

be provided with retaining means (15, 16) which grip around the
mudguard edge, wherein the guard comprises

two rounded-off triangular guard parts (4, 5), each with a
first side (7, 8) which has a radius of curvature

essentially adapted to the mudguard edge (3), and a second
side (9, 10) and a third side (11, 12) which enclose an

angle with a vertex (13, 14), which guard parts (4, 5)
together at or near their vertices (13, 14) can be fixed on

the vertical rear fork (2) by means of a clamping part (18,
18') in such a way that, on the one hand, the two second sides (9,

10) of the two guard parts (4, 5) facing each other can
form a variable opening (17) for a handbrake or a bicycle

lock and that, on the other hand, the retaining means (15,
16) can be brought into engagement with the mudguard edge

(3) at or near the first sides (7, 8), 
characterized in that

the second side (9, 10) of each guard part (4, 5) near the
first side (7, 8) is curved in a concave manner or is

provided with a recess in such a way that the variable
opening (17) can be formed by the two guard parts (4, 5),

while the vertices (13, 14) of the two guard parts (4, 5)
overlap each other.
Guard according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the guard parts (4, 5) are identical, in such a way
that they can be fitted in a mirror-inverted manner on a

mudguard edge (3).
Guard according to one of claims 1 - 2,

characterized in that
 on or near the first side (7, 8) the
guard part (4, 5) has one or more hook-shaped retaining

means adapted to the mudguard edge (3).
Guard according to claims 2 and 3, 
characterized in
that
 one or more retaining means (15, 16) are co-moulded on
both sides of the guard part (4, 5). 
Guard according to claim 3, 
characterized in that

the retaining means comprise a metal clip (30) provided
with a gripping tooth (34) for gripping the mudguard when

placed in the clip, the guard at the first side thereof
being adapted to hold the clip.
Guard according to one of claims 1 - 5,

characterized in that
 in the vertex (13, 14) the guard part
(4, 5) has one or more slot-shaped holes (27) placed in

such a way that when the vertices (13, 14) of the guard
parts (4, 5) overlap each other at least some of the holes

(27) coincide.
Guard according to one of claims 1 - 6,

characterized in that

preferably transparent plastic material.
Guard according to clais 1, 
characterized in that

the clamping part (18) can be fixed on the vertical rear

characterized in that

the clamping part (18') consists of two parts (28, 29),
which can be connected to each other at a first end and

characterized in that

the clamping part (18') can be fixed on the vertical rear
fork in such a way that it projects through one or more

partially coinciding holes (27) of the guard parts (4, 5)
