<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel phthalazin-1-ones and 
phthalazin-1-thiones, compositions containing them, processes for 
their preparation; their use as pesticides, in particular as herbicides 
and/or insecticides; and intermediates used in their synthesis. A number of phthalazinone derivatives are described in the 
literature. For example, DE-A-2632656 discloses processes for 
preparing certain 4-unsubstituted phthalazin-1-ones. GB-A-2030136 
describes 6,8-dimethyl-7-alkoxycarbonyl-1-phthalazinones having 
pharmaceutical properties. DE-A-2531776 relates to the use of 
1-phthalazinones as azo-dyes, as does US Patent No. 3,880,881. 
WO-A-93/07146 discloses benzo and pyridopyridazinones having 
pharmaceutical activity as phosphodiesterase (PDE) IV enzyme 
inhibitors, WO-A-91/12251 relates to phthalazinones for use as 
antiasthmatic agents, and US Patent No. 3,694,442 discloses 2-(3-chloropropyl)-phthalazinone 
derivatives useful as intermediates in 
the synthesis of pharmaceutically active compounds. In addition, a number of Chemical Abstract references [CA114 
(1), 6413f, 1991; CA111(1), 7325d; CA111(28), 39285g, 1989; 
CA105(5), 4273n, 1986; CA83(28), 178862j, 1975; CA106(28), 
156383v, 1987; CA97(13), 109949v, 1982; and CA116(28), 235555n, 
1992] disclose the synthesis of certain 1-phthalazinones. None of 
these references disclose or suggest any use of 1-phthalazinones or 
thiones as pesticides. EP-A-0478195 discloses certain pyridazinones 
useful as fungicides. The present invention provides a method of controlling the 
growth of pests at a locus which comprises applying to the locus a 
pesticidally effective amount of a phthalazin-1-one or  
 
phthalazin-1-thione derivative of formula I: 
   wherein:
 
   R represents:-
 
   the hydrogen atom;
 
   a straight- or branched chain alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl group 
containing up to six carbon atoms optionally substituted by one or 
more halogen atoms;
 
   a group -(-CR³R⁴)n-(phenyl)-(R5a)q;
 
   a group -(-CR³R⁴)nHet;
 
   a group -(-CR³R⁴)n-Ar, wherein Ar represents phenyl or 
pyridyl optionally substituted by one or more groups R5a and 
wherein two substituents on adjacent positions of the ring, together 
with the two atoms to which they are attached, form a 5- to 7-membered 
alicyclic ring (which is optionally unsaturated) or an 
aromatic ring, optionally containing one or more heteroatoms 
(preferably selected from oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen, it being 
understood that a sulphur atom, where present, may be in the form 
of a group -SO- or -SO₂-),
