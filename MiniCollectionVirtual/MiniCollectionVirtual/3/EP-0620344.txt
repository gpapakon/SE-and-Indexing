<ABSTRACT>
2.1 The coupling device is configured such that, upon manufacture of the sliding bar (6), no additional components have to be connected to the sliding bar. 2.2 The sliding bar exhibits mouldings (9,10) which are formed integrally with it and delimit a receiving space (11) for a web of the locking bar. The coupling device is used for side/bottom hung sash windows and up-and-over doors.

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement of a locking bar (5, 13) to be guided in 
grooves in a window or a door, and a drive element coupled to the 

locking bar by means of a coupling device, wherein the drive element is 
in the form of a thrust bar (6) or a fitment entrainment member and 

shaped portions of the thrust bar or the fitment entrainment member 
define a receiving space (11) for a leg (12) of the locking bar (13), 

characterised in that the receiving space (11) is formed by two shaped 
portions which are in the form of tongues (9, 10; 18, 19) shaped and 

stamped out of the material of the thrust bar (6) or the fitment 
entrainment member, are inclined relative to the plane of the thrust 

bar or the fitment entrainment member and with their free end surfaces 
define the receiving space (11). 
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
tongues (9, 10) extend arcuately in vertical section. 
An arrangement according to claim 2 characterised in that the 
free end surfaces of the tongues (9, 10) bear over the full surface 

thereof against the associated surfaces of the locking bar (13). 
An arrangement according to claim 1 characterised in that the 
tongues (18, 19) extend rectilinearly in vertical section and the end 

surfaces (20, 21) of the tongues are inclined to correspond to the 
inclined positioning of the tongues.
