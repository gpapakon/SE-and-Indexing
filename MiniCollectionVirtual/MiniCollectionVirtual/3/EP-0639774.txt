member (2) for holding a plurality of sample containers (1) in a 

predetermined direction; intermittent conveyor (20) means for 
conveying the holding member intermittently; an arm member (3); a 

rotary member (4) rotatably mounted on the arm member, a hand 
member (5) attached to the rotary member and including a plurality 

of grip hands (12) hinged to the rotary member so as to pivot on hinge 
shafts for gripping and releasing the one of the sample 

containers; coupling means (8) coupled to the hand member and 
including a shaft member (13) adapted to reciprocate through the 

rotary member; first drive means (9) for pivotting the hand members 
by reciprocating the shaft member of the coupling means; second 

drive means (10) for rotating the rotary member; and control means 
(11) for controlling the first drive means and the second drive means. 

The hand member is pivotted by the first drive means and the 
coupling means to cause its plurality of grip hands to grip the one 

sample container, and the rotary member is then rotated by the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sample container turning
apparatus and, more particularly, to a sample container turning
apparatus for turning a sample container (or specimen container)
containing a sample (or specimen) such as blood to be analyzed,
on the axis of the container with a view to reading the code of a
bar code label adhering to the container, or mixing and
homogenizing the sample in the container.In the prior art, there is an automatic analyzing system for
analyzing a specimen by conveying a plurality of specimen
containers to a specimen analyzing apparatus. In this system,
there has been widely used a specimen rack for holding the
specimen containers generally vertically so as to hold and convey
the containers.The specimen container held by the specimen rack may
sometimes be desired to be turned on the generally vertical axis
of the container. This occurs, for example, when the specimen in 
the container is agitated so that it may be homogenized or when
the code of the bar code label adhering to the specimen container
is read out. The following examples are known in the prior art as
the specimen container turning apparatus for turning the
specimen container held on the specimen rack on the generally
vertical axis of the container.One example is a specimen container turning apparatus
which is constructed such that it is provided with a vertically movable
rotary member rotating around a vertical axis, such
that the rotary member is lowered from above a specimen
container closed with a cap, onto the upper face of the cap of the
specimen container, and such that the rotary member is then
rotated. In the specimen container turning apparatus thus
constructed, the rotary member transmits its rotational force to
the specimen container by a frictional force which is generated
by a pressure contact between the rotary member and the cap of
the specimen container. Such apparatus is known from EP-A-0 479 622.Another example is a specimen container turning apparatus
which is constructed like the aforementioned turning apparatus
except that the rotary member has its lower face bulged or
recessed whereas the specimen container has its upper face
recessed or bulged to be fitted on the lower face of the rotary
member. In the specimen container turning apparatus thus
constructed, the rotary member transmits its rotational force to
the specimen container by the fitting contacts of the recessed 
and bulged portions of the rotary member and the specimen
container.In the former specimen container turning
