<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates, in general, to
gears and, more specifically, to gears employed in low
force and low speed applications.Gears are used in a wide variety of
applications to transmit motion between two spaced,
rotating shafts. In spur gears, two gears respectively
mounted on parallel shafts are meshed together with one
gear acting as the driving gear and the other gear being
the driven gear. The teeth of such spur gears typically
have an involute form laid out along an involute curve.
The use of such involute teeth on gears provides smooth
rolling action with minimal sliding between the two
meshing gears.From GB-A-2018027 a column switch is known having a
frist gear working on a second gear. The second gear is a
plate movable around an axis which is perpendicular to the
axis of rotation of the first gear. To increase the tolerances
between the gears the plate can be moved in direction of
its pivot axis against the force of some springs.In certain gear applications, the center
distance between the two rotating, parallel shafts
interconnected by two meshed gears is critical for the
efficient transfer of rotation between the shafts. If
the center distance is too small, the meshing gear teeth
may bind or, at least, generate high friction forces
which inhibit the smooth rotation of the gears.
Conversely, if the center distance between the two shafts
is too large, backlash between the gear teeth of the two
meshing gears increases which results in looseness
between the gears and non-uniform, jerky action of the
gears.In automotive applications, a multi-function
steering column switch apparatus is mounted on the
vehicle steering column for controlling various
electrical devices in the vehicle depending on the mode
or direction of movement of the switch. Such devices
include, for example, headlight beams, windshield wiper
assembly and turn signals. Such devices are separately 
activated by pivoting, tilting or rotational movement of
the multi-function steering column switch lever.
Contacts mounted in the switch housing are connected by a
specific movement of the lever to control the activation
and deactivation of the connected device.In such applications, rotation of the end
portion of the switch lever is typically used to control
the windshield wiper assembly between off, on and a
plurality of discrete, intermittent operating speeds. A
drive gear mounted on and rotatable with the switch lever
engages the involute teeth of a spur gear mounted in the
switch housing. The spur gear moves a contact
