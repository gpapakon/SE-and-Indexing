<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve unit with at least one pair of opposed valves on the same axis. According to the invention, a valve component shared by both valves takes the form of a one-piece bush-like valve component (20) fitted firmly in a drilling in a valve housing (14) and having on both faces a valve seat (18) co-operating with the moving valve body (16) of the valve (10, 12) concerned.

<CLAIMS>
Valve unit with at least one pair of coaxial 
valves (10) located opposite one another in relation to 

a reference plane in which a pressure-medium channel (26) 
extends, having a common valve element (20) with an 

axially continuous middle bore (32) and a transverse bore 
(30) connected thereto and to the pressure-medium channel 

and, in each case, with a movable valve body (16), 
cooperating therewith and actuable by controllable drive 

devices (39), for opening and closing a pressure-medium 
connection from or to the axial middle bore, 

characterized in that the common valve element is 
designed as a one-piece sleeve-shaped valve element (20) 

which is mounted fixedly in a bore of a valve housing 
(14) and which has, on each of its two end faces, a 

respective valve seat (18) for cooperating with the 
respective associated movable valve body (16). 
Valve unit according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each of the valves (10, 12) is designed as a valve 

with electromagnetic drive devices (39, 39') and has an 
armature (36, 36') which is under a spring pretension and 

which supports the movable valve body (16). 
Valve unit according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the movable valve body is designed as a valve ball 

(16) and is connected in one piece to the armature (36, 
36') of the associated valve (10, 12). 
Valve unit according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized by its design as a hydraulic ABS valve unit 

with two pairs of valves (10, 12), of which the first are 
designed as normally open inlet valve (10) and the others  

 
as normally closed outlet valves (12). 
Valve unit according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that a further transverse bore (34) is 

provided transversely to the transverse bore (30) in the 
stationary valve element (20). 
Valve unit according to Claim 4 or 5, characterized 
in that two pressure-medium channels (46) located on 

the outlet side are provided, and in that the two pressure-medium 
channels (46) located on the outlet side are 

each connected via a non-return valve of a non-return 
valve arrangement (50) to a bleed channel (52) for rapid 

pressure reduction in the pressure-medium channels (46) 
located on the outlet side. 
Valve unit according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the non-return valve arrangement (50) comprises two 

non-return ball valves which are each connected to one of 
the pressure-medium channels (46) located on the outlet 

side and the valve balls (56) of which are jointly under 
the pretension of a pretensioning spring (58) acting on 

both valve balls (56). 
Valve unit according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the non-return valve arrangement (50) comprises, for 

each of the pressure-medium channels (46) located on the 
outlet side, a collar (66) having a sealing lip (66a) 

which, in the event of excess pressure, can be deflected 
in order to open a connection to a brake master cylinder 

via a bleed channel (52).
