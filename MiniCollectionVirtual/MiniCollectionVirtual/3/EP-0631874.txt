<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink tank unit according
to the preamble of claim 1 for storing the ink to be supplied
to a recording head unit for the recording by discharging the
ink, an ink jet cartridge according to the preamble of claim
2, and an ink jet apparatus which performs the recording with
said cartridge mounted thereon.Known recording apparatuses which have the features of
printer, copying machine, facsimile etc., or which are useful
as an output device for a complex electronic equipment including
a computer, a word processor or a work station, are
configured to record the image onto a recording medium such
as paper or plastic thin plate, based on image information.
Such recording apparatuses can be classified into an ink jet
system, a wire dot system, a thermal system and a laser beam
system, depending on the recording method.A recording apparatus of the ink jet system (an ink jet recording
apparatus) performs the recording by discharging ink
from recording means (recording head) onto the recording medium,
having the following 
advantages. The recording means can be made compact,
high definition image can be recorded at high speed,
an ordinary paper can be used for the recording
without any special treatments, running cost is
low, noise is small owing to the non-impact method,
and an color image is easily recorded by using color
inks. In particular, a line-type recording apparatus
using recording means of the line-type in which a number
of discharge ports are arranged in a direction of sheet
width allows higher speed recording.Specifically, a recording means (recording head)
of the ink jet system of discharging the ink by the
use of heat energy can be easily fabricated with an
arrangement of liquid channels (discharge ports) at high
density by forming electrothermal converters, electrodes,
liquid channel walls, and a celling plate as a film on
a substrate through a semiconductor fabrication process
such as etching, vapor deposition or sputtering, thereby
allowing for a further compact construction.An ink vessel for use in the ink jet recording
apparatus is required to excellently supply the ink
corresponding to an ink amount to be discharged from the
recording head during the recording, and have no ink
leakage through the discharge ports when the recording
is not performed.If the ink vessel is of replacement type, the
ink vessel is required to be easily mounted or demounted, 
without ink leakage, and surely supply the ink to the
recording head.One of the ink vessels useful for the ink
