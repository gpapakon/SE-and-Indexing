<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polymer composition. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a polymer composition 
holding a large amount of a low molecular weight material therein, 
which polymer composition has a low modulus, is provided with a high 
loss property, has an excellent property of suppressing bleeding of the 
low molecular weight material and various other properties which are 
excellent, exhibits economical advantages and can be advantageously 
applied for general use. The present invention also relates to a process 
for producing said polymer composition which process can realize a 
controlled phase structure, is excellent in homogeneous dispersion of a 
large amount of the low molecular weight material and exhibits superior 
industrial produceability. In the field of polymer materials, polymer compositions having 
very low moduli, such as rubber compositions having very low moduli 
and plastic compositions having very low moduli, which polymer 
compositions exhibit high performance, high functional properties, 
excellent economic properties and properties suited for general use have 
come to be required as the applications of polymer materials have 
diversified. Processes for producing such polymer compositions which  
 
processes necessitate technologies for blending large amounts of low 
molecular weight materials with polymer materials are also strongly 
desired. General use polymer compositions having low moduli to some 
degree, such as compositions containing a general use polymer material 
and a low molecular weight material (such as a liquid) up to a medium 
amount, have heretofore been known. These polymer compositions are 
widely known because these materials can be obtained relatively easily by 
mixing a polymer material with a suitable amount of a low molecular 
weight material, which has good compatibility with the polymer 
material, by using a machine conventionally used in the industry such 
as a mixer. However, because the amount of the low molecular weight 
material used in these processes is limited, a polymer composition 
having a very low modulus cannot be obtained. A general use polymer 
composition having a very low modulus might be obtained by preparing a 
composition containing a general use polymer material component and 
a large amount of a low molecular weight material component. 
However, no such polymer composition has heretofore been known. 
When preparation of a polymer composition having a very low modulus, 
for example a polymer
