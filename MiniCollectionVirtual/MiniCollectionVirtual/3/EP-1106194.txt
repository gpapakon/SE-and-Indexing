<ABSTRACT>
The purpose of the invention is a single-use disposable
syringe of the type used to inject liquid medicines, the

structure of which consists of a hollow cylindrical body (1)
and a plunger (4) that slides along its inside, operated by a

rod (5).
The body (1) has elastic sheets (7) on its inside placed
near the bottom and slanting towards it, which retain the

plunger (4) when this goes past said sheets.
The union of the rod (5) with the plunger (4) is made by a
protuberance (8) at the end of the rod, which is inserted in an

unmovable way into the plunger so that, if an effort is made to
extract the retained plunger, the union becomes broken.
Displacement of the plunger (4) can also be set after the
first use by inserting the edge of the upper base of the rod

(5) in a peripheral neck (12) placed on the inside surface of
the body (1) near its mouth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The purpose to which the invention protected by this
Patent refers consists of a single-use disposable syringe of
the type used for injecting liquid medicines in the tissues or
organs.The known structure of these syringes includes:A hollow cylindrical body which at one end has a tube of a
smaller diameter in which a hollow needle with a sharp beveled
point is inserted.An elastic plunger which slides tightly along the
cylindrical body to alternatively suck in and push the
injectable liquid.A rod which, attached by one end to the center of one of
the faces of the plunger, sends it the movement by means of
mechanical traction or compression stresses that are manually
received at the opposite end provided with a circular flat base
of larger diameter.The syringes initially used had the same structure which
allowed them to be disinfected in boiling water so that they
could be used innumerable times.Subsequent manufacture of moldable plastic syringes made
it impossible for them to be sterilized as mentioned above and
conditioned the prescription of one use only for plastic
syringes.However, the use of syringes by marginal groups has
favored the contagion of illnesses transmitted by blood, as a
result of the promiscuity of many persons using the same
syringe even though, in spite of repeated warnings to the
contrary in publicity campaigns, nothing prevents its multiple
use. The object of the invention constituting the purpose of
this Patent consists in overcoming the inconvenience itself of
the known syringes described above, which were conceived and
designed for this priority objective.In effect, the foundation of the invention lies in
providing known syringes with auxiliary means that make it
technically impossible for them to be reused.The invention includes two distinct possibilities,
independent of the will of the user, that objectively prevent
multiple use of the syringe. Said possibilities may be used
alternatively or simultaneously, in the latter case as support
or complementary safety.The first option consists in providing the hollow body of
the syringe with means to hold back the plunger, intended to
prevent its upward movement once it has been pressed down,
consisting of elastic sheets adhered to the inside surface of
the body and arranged slightly slanting towards the bottom and
at a distance slightly higher than the height of the plunger.
These sheets may be one or more independent or one perimetral
sheet only in the form of a circular crown.The device is complemented by the characteristic
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Single-use disposable syringe, of the type used to inject

liquid medicines in tissue or organs, the structure of which
is composed of:


A hollow cylindrical body (1) which at one end has a tube (2)
of a smaller diameter in which a hollow needle (3) with a

sharp beveled point is inserted.
An elastic plunger (4) which slides tightly along the
cylindrical body (1) to alternatively suck in and push the

injectable liquid.
A rod (5) which, attached by one end to the center of one of
the faces of the plunger (4), sends it the movement by means

of mechanical traction or compression stresses that are
manually received at the opposite end provided with a

circular flat base (6) of larger diameter, characterized
basically by the fact that the hollow body (1) of the syringe

is provided with means to retain the plunger (4), intended to
prevent its retraction movement once it has been pressed

down, which consist of elastic sheets (7) adhered to the
inside surface of the body (1) and arranged slightly slanting

towards the bottom and at a distance slightly higher than the
height of the plunger (4). These sheets may be one or more

independent or one perimetral sheet only in the form of a
circular crown.
Single-use disposable syringe, according to claim 1,
characterized basically by the fact that the union of the rod

(5) with the plunger (4) is made by means of a protuberance
(8) placed at the lower end of the rod, with a flat or semi-spherical

shape, joined to the rod by a thin and short neck
(9) that connects a maximum plane of said protuberance (8) to

the end plane of the rod (5). Both planes are parallel. And
also due to the fact that the protuberance (8) is inserted

under pressure into the upper face of the plunger (4), in a
cavity (10) of the same shape, and the union is held in place

by means of the enclosure around the neck (9) of the thin
sheets (11) of the elastic material of the plunger (4) that

partially close the cavity. Therefore, as the plunger (4) is
held at the bottom of the body (1) by the slanting sheets

(7), which act as a harpoon, if an effort is made to retract
the rod (5) to its original position its union with the

plunger (4) is broken as the protuberance (8) leaves its
housing in the cavity (10) and is not able to be reinserted.
Single-use disposable syringe, according to the above claims,
characterized basically by the fact that the length of the

rod (5) is adapted to the hollow body (1) so that, when the
plunger (4) reaches the bottom of said body (1), the plane

face (6) of the upper circular base of the rod (5) becomes
level with its mouth, in order that its outline is embedded

in a perimetral neck (12) placed on the inside surface of the
hollow body (1), next to its mouth. To facilitate this

insertion, the lower face (13) of the upper circular base of
the rod (5) has a convex shape towards the edge, so that when

said edge becomes thinner it can be deformed in a more
elastic way and overcome the projecting edges (14) of the

mouth until it is inserted in the neck (12) from where it
cannot be extracted. This way of setting can be used together

with the preceding one, as a safety reinforcement, or
independently.
