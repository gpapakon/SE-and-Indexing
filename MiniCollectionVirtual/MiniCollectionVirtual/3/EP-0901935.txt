<ABSTRACT>
A motor vehicle includes at least one passenger seat
provided with a pair of laterally spaced-apart

anchorage members (10) for anchoring a child seat (2).
The anchorage members (10) are pivotally mounted in

relation to the seat whereby they can be pivoted
between a use position in which they are upwardly

disposed through a gap between the squab (4) and the
seat-back (6) so that a clip or latch of a child seat

(2) can be secured to it, and a stowage position in
which they are disposed beneath or behind the squab.

The anchorage members (10) are constrained to pivot in
opposite directions to one another when moving from the

use position to the stowage position or 
vice versa.

The invention also provides an anchorage device for
mounting in relation to a vehicle seat, comprising a

pair of spaced-apart anchorage members (10) which are
constrained to pivot in opposite directions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a motor vehicle which
has a passenger seat provided with means for anchoring
a child seat to it, and to a device for use in
anchoring a child seat to a motor vehicle seat.The prior art is illustrated e.g. by EP-A-537019 and GB-A-2302274.Some vehicle child seats are secured in a vehicle
passenger seat by a pair of clips or latches on the
child seat which are releasably mounted on a pair of
rigid anchorage points in the vehicle. Such rigid
anchorage points are specified, for example, in Isofix
standard documentation. The anchorage points are
located in the seat bight between the squab and the
seat-back. The linkages between the clips or latches
on the child seat and the anchorage points are
sufficiently rigid to secure a child seat to the
passenger seat without the need for any other securing
means to be used.The provision of rigid anchorage points makes folding
of the seat difficult, because the anchorages prevent
the seat-back from being fully lowered. The anchorage
points may also be uncomfortable for a passenger
sitting in the seat when the child seat is not mounted
on the seat. Further problems with the above
arrangement are that the clips on the child seat are
liable to damage the fabric of the seat-back or to
damage an adjacent socket for a seat belt buckle, if
accidentally pushed into the socket.It is an object of the present invention to provide a
child seat anchorage device which reduces at least one
of the above problems. According to a first aspect of the present invention
there is provided a motor vehicle which includes at
least one passenger seat comprising a squab and a seat-back
and being provided with a pair of laterally
spaced-apart anchorage members for anchoring a child
seat, the anchorage members being pivotally mounted in
relation to the seat whereby the anchorage members can
be pivoted between a use position in which they are
upwardly disposed through a gap between the squab and
the seat-back so that a clip or latch of a child seat
can be secured to it, and a stowage position in which
the anchorage members are disposed beneath or behind
the squab, the anchorage members being constrained to
pivot in opposite directions to one another when moving
from the use position to the stowage position or vice
versa.Because the anchorage members are pivotable, they can
be stowed away behind the squab of the vehicle seat
when not required. The seat-back can be tilted fully
forward when the anchorage members are in the stowage
position, and passengers not requiring

<CLAIMS>
A motor vehicle which includes at least one
passenger seat comprising a squab (4) and a seat-back (6) and

being provided with a pair of laterally spaced-apart
anchorage members (10) for anchoring a child seat (2),


characterised in that
 the
anchorage members (10) are pivotally mounted in relation

to the seat whereby the anchorage members (10) can be
pivoted between a use position in which they are

upwardly disposed through a gap between the squab (4) and
the seat-back (6) so that a clip or latch (8) of a child seat (2)

can be secured to it, and a stowage position in which
the anchorage members (10) are disposed beneath or behind

the squab (4), the anchorage members (10) being constrained to
pivot in opposite directions to one another when moving

from the use position to the stowage position or 
vice
versa.
A motor vehicle as claimed in claim 1, wherein at
least one of the anchorage members is provided with a

detent so that it resists being pivoted from the use
position.
A motor vehicle as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein the anchorage members are connected together as

a child seat anchoring device by spacing means.
A motor vehicle as claimed in any one of claims 1
to 3, wherein the passenger seat can tilt forward on

actuation of a seat latch release mechanism, and
wherein an interlock mechanism is associated with the

seat latch release mechanism whereby when the seat-back
is unlatched the interlock prevents deployment of the

anchorage members to the use position. 
A motor vehicle as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the passenger seat can tilt

forward on actuation of a seat latch release mechanism,
and wherein an interlock mechanism is associated with

the seat latch release mechanism whereby unlatching of
the seat-back is prevented when an anchorage member is

in the use position.
A motor vehicle as claimed in any one of claims 1
to 4, wherein a link is provided which automatically

moves the anchorage members from the use position to
the stowage position when the seat-back is folded.
A motor vehicle as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein each anchorage member is

provided with a guard plate which is disposed between
the seat-back and the anchorage member when the

anchorage member is in the use position.
A motor vehicle as claimed in claim 7, wherein
each guard plate is provided with a finger hole to

facilitate lifting of the anchorage member out from
behind or below the squab.
A motor vehicle as claimed in claim 7 or claim 8,
wherein the guard plate is arranged or adapted to move

the seat's seatbelt webbing to one side when its
associated anchorage member is raised, to ensure that

the webbing is not contacted by a child seat latch
during seat installation.
A motor vehicle as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein at least one anchorage member

is provided with a cover arranged to overlie a seatbelt 
buckle socket when the anchorage member is in the use

position.

ear which depends from the guard plate.
A motor vehicle as claimed in any one of the
preceding claims, wherein the foam density of material

in the seat-back is reduced in the region of the

preceding claims, wherein an upper tether is provided,

to which a child seat can be anchored when mounted on
the vehicle seat.

together by spacing means (18), each anchorage member (10) being
pivotally mounted to an associated bracket (20) so that when

the brackets are suitably mounted in relation to a
vehicle seat each anchorage member (10) can be pivoted

between a use position in which it is upwardly disposed
through a gap between the squab (4) and the seat-back (6) so 

that a clip (8) of a child seat (2) can be secured to it, and a
stowage position in which the anchorage member (10) is

disposed behind or beneath the squab (4), the anchorage

position to the stowage position or 
vice versa.
A device as claimed in claim 14, wherein the
spacing means is substantially rigid.
