<ABSTRACT>
A device for evacuating condensate from a rotary, steam-heated drying cylinder or the like, in particular the drying cylinder of a paper machine, has a plurality of grooves (23) provided at the inner wall in the circumferential direction of the cylinder jacket (12), and a condensate evacuation pipe (20) which may be associated to said grooves and which supplies the condensate produced to a collector (18) and then to a condensate discharge pipe (14). The condensate evacuation pipes (20) are fixed in the area of the associated grooves (23) at a predetermined distance from the bottom of the grooves. The invention is characterised in that a flexible connection element (30) is provided to functionally connect the condensate evacuation pipes (20) to the collector (18).

<CLAIMS>
A rotating, steam-heated drying cylinder (1) with a device for the removal 
of condensate therefrom, in particular concerning a drying cylinder (1) of a 

paper machine, in which on the inner wall a plurality of grooves (23) are 
provided, running in circumferential direction of the cylinder jacket (12), in 

which there is associated with each groove (23) a condensate removal pipe (20) 
with a substantially radial inflow direction with respect to the cylinder rotation 

axis (10), via which the condensate which arises is supplied to a collector (18) 
and from here is supplied to a condensate outflow duct (14), in which the 

condensate removal pipes (20) are fixed in the region of the respective groove 
(23) at a predetermined distance from the base of the groove, and in which, for 

the functional connection of the condensate removal pipes (20) with the 
collector (18) a flexible connecting element (40) is provided, characterised in 

that the connecting elements depart from the collector (18) radially to the 
circumferential direction of the cylinder jacket (12), in which each connecting 

element is a compensator (40) bridging the free space between the condensate 
removal pipe (20) and the collector (18). 
A device according to Claim 1, characterised in that each condensate 
removal pipe (20) is provided with a disc (44), collar or the like, which is able to 

be firmly placed onto the inner wall of the cylinder, i.e. onto two ribs (22) 
delimiting the groove (23).
