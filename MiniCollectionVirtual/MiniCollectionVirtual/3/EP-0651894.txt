<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of electrostatic 
imaging and, more particularly, to the preparation of liquid 
toners containing components for improving the stabilization 
of the electrical properties due to the charge directors 
contained therein. In the art of electrostatic photocopying or photoprinting, 
a latent electrostatic image is generally produced 
by first providing a photoconductive imaging surface with a 
uniform electrostatic charge, e.g. by exposing the imaging 
surface to a charge corona. The uniform electrostatic 
charge is then selectively discharged by exposing it to a 
modulated beam of light corresponding, e.g., to an optical 
image of an original to be copied or to a computer generated 
image, thereby forming an electrostatic charge pattern on 
the photoconductive imaging surface, i.e. a latent 
electrostatic image having a background portion at one 
potential and a "print" portion at another potential. The 
latent electrostatic image can then be developed by applying 
to it charged pigmented toner particles, which adhere to the 
"print" portions of the photoconductive surface to form a 
toner image which is subsequently transferred by various 
techniques to a copy sheet (e.g. paper). It will be understood that other methods may be 
employed to form an electrostatic image, such as, for 
example, providing a carrier with a dielectric surface and 
transferring a preformed electrostatic charge to the 
surface. The charge may be formed from an array of 
styluses. This invention will be described in respect of 
office copiers and the like, though it is to be understood 
that it is applicable to other uses involving 
electrostatographics including electrostatographic printing. In liquid-developed electrostatic imaging, the toner 
particles are generally dispersed in an insulating non-polar 
liquid carrier, generally an aliphatic hydrocarbon fraction, 
which generally has a high-volume resistivity above 109 ohm 
cm, a dielectric constant below 3.0 and a low vapor pressure  
 
(less then 10 torr. at 25Â°C). The liquid developer system 
further comprises so-called charge directors, i.e. compounds 
capable of imparting to the toner particles an electrical 
charge of the desired polarity and uniform magnitude so that 
the particles may be electrophoretically deposited on the 
photoconductive surface to form a toner image. In the course of the process, liquid developer is 
applied to the photoconductive imaging surface. Under the 
influence of the electrical potential present in the
