<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a reagent for endotoxin
assay, a kit for endotoxin assay, a method for endotoxin
assay, a carrier for pretreating samples, a method for
inhibiting activation of factor G and a factor G activation
inhibitor, in which a limulus amebocyte lysate reagent is
used.A method for assaying endotoxin (hereinafter referred
to as "Et") using a limulus amebocyte lysate (hereinafter
simply referred to as "lysate") is well known as a limulus
test. The assay comprising the reaction of the lysate is
called a limulus reaction. A limulus test has so high
sensitivity that is widely employed in pyrogen check of drugs
and water, diagnostic use, and the like. The limulus test is
based on coagulation of a lysate in the presence of a trace
amount of endotoxin. The latest biochemical study has
elucidated the fact that the limulus reaction is composed of
stepwise activation of several coagulation factors (J.
Protein Chem., 5, 255-268 (1986)).The limulus reaction is illustrated below with
respect to a lysate from Tachypleus tridentatus by referring
to FIG. 1. On endotoxin addition to a lysate, factor C (an
endotoxin-sensitive factor; molecular weight: 123,000) in the 
lysate is activated. The activated factor C limitedly
hydrolyzes factor B (molecular weight: 64,000) at a specific
site to produce activated factor B. The activated factor B
activates proclotting enzyme (molecular weight: 54,000) to
convert into clotting enzyme. The clotting enzyme limitedly
hydrolyzes coagulogen (coagulant protein; molecular weight:
19,723) at the specific sites in the loop crosslinked by a
disulfide linkage, i.e., intermediate between ...Arg18 and
Thr19... and intermediate between ...Arg46 and Gly47... to
release peptide C (28 amino acid residues) represented by
H-Thr19......Arg46-OH while converting the remaining part into
coagulin gel. Thus, the limulus reaction is composed of a
series of reactions (cascade reaction caused by endotoxin is
hereinafter referred to as factor C system reaction).The above-mentioned cascade reaction of a lysate is
induced by not only endotoxin but also a (1→3)-β-D-glucan
(hereinafter simply referred to as a β-glucan). That is,
factor G (a β-glucan-sensitive factor) in FIG. 1 is activated
by a β-glucan, the activated factor G converts proclotting
enzyme into clotting enzyme, and clotting enzyme acts on
coagulogen to produce coagulin gel in the same manner of
endotoxin as described above (cascade reaction caused by a β-glucan
is hereinafter referred to as factor G system
reaction).The clotting
