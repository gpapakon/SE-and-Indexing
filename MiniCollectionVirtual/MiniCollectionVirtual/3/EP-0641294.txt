A process for denaturing and coagulating paints and 
other organic coating materials, more particularly water-based 

paint systems ("water paints"), in circuit waters 
of wet separators for spray painting installations, paint 

coagulants known per se being added to the circuit water, 
characterized in that the hardness of the circuit water 

is adjusted to values of 0 to 1.0 mmole/l alkaline earth 
metal ion equivalents. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the hardness of the circuit water is adjusted to 

values of 0 to 0.2 mmole/l alkaline earth metal ion equivalents. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the paint coagulants contain at least one of the 

following components a) to h) as active constituents: 

a) layer silicates, preferably from the group of 
montmorillonites, bentonites, hectorites or kaolins, 
b) waxes, preferably in the form of an aqueous dispersion, 
c) ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers which contain 8 to 

25% by weight of acrylic acid units and 92 to 75% by 
weight of ethylene units, based on the acid form of 

the copolymer, and which are present as the salt of 
an inorganic or organic base, preferably in the form 

of an aqueous concentrate, 
d) talcum, 
e) alumina, 
f) polyethylene imines and/or protonated or alkylated 
derivatives of polyethylene imine, 
g) water-soluble alkali metal and/or ammonium salts of 
molybdic acid and/or isopolymolybdic acid and 
h) polyelectrolytes based on quaternary methacrylates. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, characterized in 
that the coagulants additionally contain at least one of 

the following components i) to k): 

i) a compound from the group consisting of cyanamide, 
dicyanodiamide or cyanamide salts, preferably dicyanodiamide, 
j) a hydroxide, carbonate or hydrogen carbonate of the 
alkali metals, 
k) active substances and/or auxiliaries typical of 
paint coagulants, preferably biocides, pH regulators, 

corrosion inhibitors, antifoam agents or 
solubilizers. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
4, characterized in that the coagulants are added to the 

circuit water in a quantity of 0.5 to 40% by weight and 
preferably 1.0 to 10% by weight of active substance, 

based on paint overspray. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
5, characterized in that the pH value of the circuit 

water is in the range from 2 to 12 and preferably in the 
range from 5 to 9. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
6, characterized in that the hardness of the circuit 

water is adjusted by addition of hardness binding agents. 
A process as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, 

alkali metal hydrogen carbonates, alkali metal silicates, 
alkali metal phosphates, complexing agents for alkaline 

earth metal ions and/or ion exchangers are used as the 
hardness binding agents. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterized in 
that zeolitic alkali metal aluminium silicates, aminopolycarboxylic 

acids, phosphonic acids and/or water-soluble  
 

salts of the acids mentioned are used as the 
complexing agents. 
A process as claimed in claim 7 or 8, characterized 
in that the complexing agents are added to the circuit 

water in a quantity of 0.05 to 0.5% by weight, based on 
the quantity of circuit water. 
A process as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 
10, characterized in that hardness binding agents and 

alkali metal layer silicates poor in alkaline earth 
metals are added to the circuit water. 
A process as claimed in claim 11, characterized in 
that alkali metal layer silicates containing less than 

2% by weight of alkaline metal ions are used. 
A process as claimed in claim 11 or 12, characterized 
in that the alkali metal layer silicates are used 

in a quantity of 0.5 to 10% by weight and more particularly 
in a quantity of 1 to 4% by weight, based on paint 

overspray.
