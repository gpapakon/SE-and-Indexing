<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistance ratio of 200% (absolute value) or more at a given 
temperature, e.g., at room temperature, in a field of 6T can be achieved in a layer 

(61) of material of nominal composition XMnO
y
 (X is La and at least one of Ca, Sr 
and Ba, y in the range

 
2-3.5), if, after formation of the layer, the layer is heat treated in an oxygen-rich (O₂ 

partial pressure greater than that of air) atmosphere, typically in flowing O₂. The 
temperature and duration of the heat treatment are in the range 300-850°C and 10 

minutes - 12 hours, and are selected to result in the desired ratio of 200% or more.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a method of making an article that comprises a magnetoresistive material 
(e.g., a magnetic field probe or a recording head) as defined in claim 1. The "magnetoresistance" (MR) of a material is the resistance R(H) of 
the material in an applied magnetic field H minus the resistance Ro in the absence of 
an applied field. This resistance difference ΔR ( = R(H) - Ro) is typically 
normalized (e.g., by dividing by R(H)) and expressed as a magnetoresistance ratio in 
percent. Conventional materials (e.g., permalloy) typically have a positive MR 
ratio of a few percent. Recently, relatively large values of MR ratio were observed 
in metallic multilayer structures, e.g., Fe/Cr or Cu/Co, e.g., as high as 40% at room 
temperature. See, for instance, E. F. Fullerton, AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 63 
(12), p. 1699. High MR ratios at low temperature (typically below 50K) were also 
observed in Eu1-xGdxSe. Values of MR substantially larger (in absolute value) 
than those of conventional materials are usually referred to as "giant" MR. See, for 
instance, P. M. Levy, Science, Vol. 256, p. 972. More recently still, giant MR ratios were observed in mixed metal 
oxides. K. Chahara et al., AppliedPhysicsLetters, Vol. 63 (14), pp. 1990-1992 
disclose a ratio of -53% in La0.72Ca0.25 MnOz. The material exhibited essentially 
zero MR at room temperature. R. von Helmolt et al., PhysicalReviewLetters, Vol. 71(14), pp. 
2331-2333 report observation of a room temperature MR ratio of about -150% in 
thin films of perovskite-like La.67 Ba.33 Mn-oxide. As-deposited films were 
paramagnetic, but after subsequent heat treatment (900°C, air, 12 hours) the samples 
exhibited a ferromagnetic magnetization curve. Bulk samples of that composition 
are known to be metallic ferromagnets, with Curie temperature of 343K, but small 
MR ratio.  
 EP-A-O 645 831 discloses a magnetoresistive sensor based on La-Ba-Mn-oxide 
or similar material, with an exemplary material having an absolute MR 
ratio of about 233% at about 220K, dropping to about 67% at about 25°C. 
Deposition of the material in an atmosphere having oxygen partial pressure in the 
range 0.2-0.6 mbar is disclosed. It will be readily apparent that for purposes of commercial use, it would 
be highly desirable to have available a material which exhibits even higher MR at 
room temperature (~25°C). A higher MR ratio could lead, inter alia, to increased 
device sensitivity, and potentially make possible new applications. The possibility
