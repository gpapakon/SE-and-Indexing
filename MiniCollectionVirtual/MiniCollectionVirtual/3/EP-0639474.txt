<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an air filter, in particular for the ventilation of the interior of motor vehicles. This air filter comprises a housing which is provided with an untreated-air inlet and a clean-air outlet, and also comprises a filter medium folded in the shape of a zigzag. This filter medium is arranged in a filter insert 17 which is provided with a peripheral seal 19. Integrated in the housing 10 is an adapter 11 which likewise has a peripheral seal 12 for effectively sealing off the untreated-air side and clean-air side from each other. The filter insert 17 is arranged in the adapter 11 and is fixed in its position via a covering flap 23.
