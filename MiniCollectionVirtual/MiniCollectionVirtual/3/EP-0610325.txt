<ABSTRACT>
A disposable assay device for assaying a sample comprises a body (10) including a reaction chamber (12) which contains or is adapted to receive an assay reagent sensitive to a component (e.g. a nicotine metabolite) being assayed for in the sample. A sample collector/dispenser (20) has a sample collecting chamber (22) closed by an elastic membrane (24) and a downwardly projecting sampling and piercing tube (28), to enable a predetermined quantity of sample to be dispensed into the reaction chamber (12). The body (10) and the collector/dispenser (20) are non-detachably engageable together by engagement of rib (34) on collector/dispenser (20) with lip (18) on the body (10). A seal (32) seals the assembly to prevent leakage of the contents after use.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an assay device and is more particularly 
concerned with a disposable assay device which is relatively safe and 
convenient to use and dispose of, and in which there is a reduced risk of 
operator contamination from either the assay reagents, or the sample to 
be analysed, or the resultant reaction mixture. This invention is 
particularly, but not exclusively, concerned with a disposable assay 
device for assaying for nicotine metabolites in samples of urine for the 
purpose of checking on recent smoking habit. The treatment of smoking-related disease is a major expenditure and 
there is a need for a convenient accurate determination of patient's 
smoking habit in order to determine appropriate and effective treatment 
of smoking-related diseases. There is also a demand for an assay device 
which can be used by non-chemists in extra-laboratory situations such as 
doctors surgeries, anti-natal clinics, industrial plants, water works, farms 
or the home. In order to be suitable for this, it is important for the assay 
device to be relatively easy and safe to use and to be relatively safely 
disposed of. WO93/00994 discloses an assay device comprising a cylindrical tube 
containing a reagent, and a plunger which is slidable relative to the tube. 
The plunger has a grooved, sample-collecting region which serves to 
collect a sample to be assayed in the grooves and which can be slid into 
the tube to introduce the sample into the latter for analysis. A further 
plunger at the opposite end of the tube to the first-mentioned plunger is 
provided for introducing a further reagent into the tube. WO90/14163 discloses an assay device comprising a sample module, a 
reaction module and a collection module. The sample module is used  
 
to carry a sample to be analysed and has a lower outlet end closed by a 
frangible barrier. The lower end has a tapered portion which is 
frictionally engageable within a corresponding tapered socket in the top 
of the reaction module. The socket in the reaction module has a pointed 
member arranged to pierce the barrier when the sample module is 
engaged with the reaction module so as to permit the sample to drain 
from the sample module into the reaction module. It is an object of the present invention to provide such an assay device. According to the present invention, there is provided a disposable assay 
device for assaying a sample, comprising a body including a reaction 
chamber which contains or is adapted to receive an assay reagent 
sensitive to a

<CLAIMS>
A disposable assay device for assaying a sample, comprising a 
body including a reaction chamber which contains or is adapted to 

receive an assay reagent sensitive to a component being assayed for in 
the sample, a sample collector/dispenser having a sample collection 

chamber for collecting a sample to be assayed and for dispensing a 
predetermined quantity of sample into the reaction chamber, said body 

and said collector/dispenser being non-detachably engaged or non-detachably 
engageable together, and means for sealing the assembly of 

body and collector/dispenser to prevent leakage of the contents of the 
reaction chamber after use. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sample 
collector/dispenser is adapted to be non-detachably engaged with said 

body after a sample has been collected, and the sealing means acts 
between the body and the collector/dispenser. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 2, wherein the sample 
collection chamber is defined between two relatively moveable parts 

such that relative movement of the parts in one direction causes said 
predetermined quantity of the sample to be dispensed therefrom into the 

reaction chamber. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 1, wherein the sample 
collection chamber is defined by the cylinder of a piston and cylinder 

device so that the sample can be aspirated into the sample collection 
chamber and then dispensed therefrom by relative movement of the 

piston and cylinder.  
 
An assay device as claimed in claim 4, wherein the piston has a 
tube mounted thereon which communicates with the sample collecting 

chamber through an upper hole at the underside of the piston, and 
wherein the piston is moveable into a position in which the upper hole 

is at the bottom of the chamber to permit the sample to be dispensed 
from the chamber in use. 
An assay device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
body is an open-topped elongated cylindrical body which is arranged to 

receive the collector/dispenser, and a sliding seal arrangement is 
provided between the body and the dispenser. 
An assay device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
body and the collector/dispenser are non-detachably engaged or non-detachably 

engageable together by means of an inwardly directed lip on 
one of the body and the collector/dispenser which is engaged or 

engageable with an outwardly directed lip on the other of the body and 
the collector/dispenser. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 7, wherein the lips have 
ramp surfaces to assist in engagement of the collector/dispenser with the 

body and abutment surfaces to prevent disengagement of the 
collector/dispenser from the body. 
An assay device as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein the 
reaction chamber is closed by a pierceable or moveable membrane. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 9, wherein the membrane 
is of multi-layer construction.  

 
An assay device as claimed in claim 9, wherein the body and 
the collector/dispenser are permanently non-detachably engaged 

together, and the collector/dispenser has an inlet which is opened to 
collect a sample, said inlet being closable by the means for sealing the 

assembly. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 11, wherein the sealing 
means comprises a cap which is engageable over that part of the 

collector/dispenser having the inlet so as to seal the assembly 
permanently. 
An assay device as claimed in any preceding claim, 
with the assay reagent therein. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 11, wherein the assay 
reagent is designed to assay for nicotine metabolites. 
An assay device as claimed in claim 13 or 14, wherein the 
assay reagent is loose in the reaction chamber, immobilised onto the 

walls thereof or applied to a separate member disposed in the reaction 
chamber.
