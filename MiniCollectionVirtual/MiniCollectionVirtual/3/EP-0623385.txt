<ABSTRACT>
Process for the preparation of a catalyst, the said catalyst including at least one refractory inorganic support and at least one metal of group VIII of the Periodic Classification (platinum, palladium, nickel and ruthenium) and at least one additional metal M chosen from germanium, tin, lead, iron, titanium and chromium, characterised in that the said metal M is introduced, in the form of at least one organometallic complex, in situ into the reactor where the hydrocarbon feedstock will be subsequently treated. The catalyst prepared according to the invention is suitable for reactions of dehydrogenation, especially of paraffinic hydrocarbons to olefinic hydrocarbons.

A process for the preparation of a catalyst
consisting in introducing at least one additional

metal M into a calcined and activated catalytic
mass termed a precatalyst, the precatalyst

comprising at least one support and at least one
metal from group VIII of the periodic

classification of the elements, characterized in
that the additional metal is introduced in the form

of an organic compound, pure of diluted, in situ in
an inert or reducing atmosphere, into the reaction

zone where a feedstock is to be treated in the
presence of said catalyst or into a reaction

prezone directly in contact with the reaction zone.
Process according to claim 1 for the preparation of
a catalyst comprising at least one support, at

least one metal from group VIII of the periodic
classification of the elements and at least one

additional metal M, the process being characterised
in that


a) in a first step of said preparation, a
precatalyst is prepared offsite which

comprises at least one said support and at
least one said group VIII metal, the 

precatalyst at this point being optionally
dried and being calcined,
b) the precatalyst is introduced into the
reaction zone where the feedstock to be

treated by said catalyst will be fed, or into
a reaction prezone directly connected to said

reaction zone,
c) the precatalyst is then activated in a neutral
atmosphere (inert gas) or a reducing

atmosphere, and
d) in a second step of said preparation, said
additional metal M is introduced into the

precatalyst by bringing it into contact with
at least one organic compound of additional

metal M in an inert or reducing atmosphere.
Process according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the
group VIII metal is selected from the group

constituted by platinum, palladium, nickel and
ruthenium.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein additional metal M is selected from the

group constituted by germanium, tin, lead, iron,
titanium and chromium. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 4
wherein the support comprises at least one

refractory oxide.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 5
wherein the catalyst further contains at least one

alkali or alkaline-earth metal.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 6
wherein the catalyst also contains at least one

metalloid.
Process according to claim 7 wherein the metalloid
is sulphur.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 8
wherein the catalyst comprises at least one halogen

or halogenated compound.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 9
wherein, during the second step, the organic

compound of additional metal M is introduced in the
liquid or gaseous phase. 
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 9
wherein, during the second step, the organic

compound of metal M is introduced into the catalyst
in at least one impregnating solvent which is a

hydrocarbon solution.
Process according to any one of claims 1 to 11
wherein the precatalyst is activated in a reducing

atmosphere, in the presence of hydrogen between
300째C and 600째C.
Process according to any one of claims 11 and 12
wherein, when the catalyst has been prepared, the

additional metal M impregnating solvent is
eliminated and the catalyst is thermally treated

before the feedstock is brought into contact with
the catalyst.
Process according to claim 13 wherein said thermal
treatment is carried out in a current of hydrogen,

at a temperature between 300째C and 600째C.
Process according to any one of claims 11 to 14
wherein additional metal M is introduced into the 

precatalyst in the form of at least one
organometallic compound or alcoholate.
Process according to claim 15 wherein said
organometallic compound or alcoholate is selected

from the group formed by carbonyl or polyketone
complexes of metals M and metallic hydrocarbons of

metal M such as alkyls, cycloalkyls, aryls,
alkylaryls and arylalkyls.
Process according to any one of claims 11 to 16
wherein said organic compound of metal M is

selected from the group constituted by
hexacarbonyl iron, titanium isopropylate,

dichlorodicyclopentadienyl titanium, tetrabutyl
tin, tetramethyl tin, tetrapropyl germanium,

diphenyl tin and tetraethyl lead.
Process according to any one of claims 11 to 17
