<ABSTRACT>
Module, which is connected to a bus coupler (4) on one side, having a contact system (1) for connecting electrically and, if required, mechanically, to a bus. On the other side, the bus (4) is connected to evaluation electronics (5) for the programmed processing of measuring signals or, respectively, state information, and for emitting switch-off commands. The measuring signals or state information can be fed via the bus. The switch-off commands are suitable for tripping a tripping system (6) for a circuit breaker (14).

<CLAIMS>
Circuit-breaker module for acting on the
tripping system of a circuit-breaker by means of a

tripping command, characterized in that a bus coupler
(4) is connected to a contact system (1) for the

electrical, and optionally mechanical, connection to a
bus, with evaluation electronics (5) for the programmed

processing of measuring signals or information on
states which require a disconnection command and for

the delivery of disconnection commands,

whereby the measuring signals or information on states
can be supplied by way of a bus.
Circuit-breaker module according to claim 1,
characterized in that the evaluation electronics (5)

have devices for loading a suitable program for
processing.
Circuit-breaker module according to claim 2,
characterized by a device for loading a program by way

of a bus.
Circuit-breaker module according to claim 3,
characterized in that the program is firmly stored and

has interfaces for the input of parameters.
Circuit-breaker module according to one of
claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the module is

arranged in a coupling adaptor (15) and the evaluation
electronics (5) are connected to a tripping system (6)

which is in operative connection with a tripping shaft
(7).
Circuit-breaker module according to one of
claims 1 to 5, characterized in that housing sensors

(9), in particular current sensors or measuring
elements, are arranged in the module.
Circuit-breaker module according to one of
claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the module

additionally has a separate terminal for an external
sensor (8).
