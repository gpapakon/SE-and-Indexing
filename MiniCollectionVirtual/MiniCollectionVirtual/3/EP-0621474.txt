<ABSTRACT>
A chemically sensitive sensor (
10
) capable of detecting 
changes in concentrations of ions, atoms, or molecules 

in a fluid environment (
38
) in which the sensor is immersed 
or embedded comprises a thin clad optical fiber (
26
), which 
is coated with a polymer (
34
) which is permeable to liquids 
and which contains a chemically sensitive material, and a 

light carrying fiber (
20
). The polymeric material has the 
ability to change color and/or absorbance when the concentration 

of the ion, atom, or molecule in the surrounding 
environment changes. The polymer will return to its original 

color and/or absorbance state once the concentration 
goes back to the original value. The color change or absorbance 

is detected through the core (
30
) of the optical 
fiber which is connected to a photodetector (
28
). The coupling 
of the light (
22
) into the sensing structure is obtained 
by using a core-only optical fiber (
20
), surrounded 
by a clad material (
36
), in addition to an external light 
source (
24
). Coupling of the external light beam with the 
polymeric coated fiber is obtained through microbending 

losses in reverse by spooling the coated fiber around the 
clad material. Changes such as pH, metal or other ion 

concentration, organic molecule concentration, and gas 
molecule concentration may be detected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to sensors, and, 
more particularly, to chemical sensors useful in monitoring 
environmental pollutants. European patent application 381612 entitled "Construction 
of a medical probe with bonded light sensitive compound 
and use thereof", published 8 August 1990, describes 
the bonding onto porous glass of an oxygen sensitive molecule 
and then the coating of the glass with a silicone resin. 
The probe is used to measure oxygen concentration. 
The patent states it might also be used for the measurement 
of pH. However, work completed during the course of making 
the present invention shoved that a coating such as disclosed 
in that reference (a silicone) was not sufficiently 
permeable to water and ions for this pH sensitivity application. 
Silicones do have high permeability to oxygen but 
not to water or hydrogen ions. Glass bound pH indicators are described in a reference 
by Harper Bruce, "Reusable glass-bound pH indicators", Analytical 
Chemistry, Vol. 47(2), 348-351 (1975). However, 
there is no disclosure or suggestion that these indicators 
may be used in a fiber optic device. Polymeric acid-base indicators are described in a publication 
by M. Tahan et al, "Synthesis of some polymeric 
dyes", Isr. J. Chem., 1971, 9 (2), 191-200. These are not 
described for optical coatings. A review of fiber optic chemical and biochemical sensors 
for environmental monitoring is described by A.L. Harmer,  
 
"Fibre Optic Chemical and Biochemical Sensors for Environmental 
Monitoring" in Optoelectronics for Environmental 
Science, S. Martellucci and A.N. Chester, Eds., Plenum 
Press (New York), pp. 39-43 (1989). No prior art in the packaging of devices for rugged 
applications such as the one described herein is known. 
Thus, there remains a need for a chemically sensitive sensor 
for environmental monitoring. In accordance with the invention, a chemically sensitive 
sensor is provided for detecting changes in concentrations 
of ions or molecules. The sensor comprises: 
(a) a light source portion including a light 
source; (b) a light detector portion including means for 
detecting light; (c) at least one probe portion; and  (d) a fiber optic cable portion.   
The fiber optic portion comprises two optical fibers, a 
first optical fiber comprising a core-only fiber, connected 
between the means for detecting light and the probe portion, 
and a second optical fiber comprising a core and a 
cladding layer. The second optical fiber has a chemically 
sensitive coating thereon and is
