<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for activating receptors selected from receptor tyrosine kinases, cytokine receptors and members of the nerve growth factor receptor superfamily. A conjugate comprising the direct fusion of at least two ligands capable of binding to the receptor(s) to be activated is contacted with the receptors, whereby the ligands bind their respective receptors inducing receptor oligomerization.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to conjugates for receptor activation. More
particularly, the invention concerns conjugates for ligand-induced
oligomerization of cell-surface receptors. The invention further relates
to methods for making ligand variants that act as competitive agonists
of the respective native ligands, and to ligand-immuqoglobulin Chimeras.Many polypeptides, such as growth factors, differentiation factors,
and hormones mediate their actions by binding to and activating cell
surface receptors. Although the mechanism of receptor activation varies
for specific receptor-ligand pairs and is often not entirely understood,
it is a common feature of many receptors that they need to be
oligomerized to become active, or that their activity is enhanced by
oligomerization. Growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity
(receptor tyrosine kinases) and certain cytokine receptors are typical
representatives of such receptors.Receptors with tyrosine kinase activity have a similar molecular
topology. They all possess an extracellular ligand binding domain, a
hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that contains
a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain, and can be further classified on the
basis of sequence similarity and distinct structural characteristics
[Hanks, S.K. et al., Science241, 42-52 (1988); Yardan, Y. and Ollrich,
A., Annu. Rev. Biochem.57, 443-478 (1988)]. Monomeric subclass I
receptors have two cysteine-rich repeat sequences in the extracellular
domain; subclass II receptors have disulfide-linked heterotetrameric
σ2β2-type structures with similar cysteine-rich repeat sequences; whereas
the extracellular domains of subclass III and IV receptors have five or
three immunoglobulin-like repeats, respectively. For example, receptors
for insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth
factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), colony-stimulating
factor 1 (CSF-1), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) belong in this
family.Because of their configuration, receptor tyrosine kinases can be
envisioned as membrane-associated allosteric enzymes. As in these
receptors, in contrast to water-soluble enzymes, the ligand binding 
domain and the tyrosine kinase catalytic domain (protein tyrosine kinase
activity) are separated by the plasma membrane, receptor activation due
to extracellular ligand binding must be translated across the membrane,
barrier in order to activate intracellular domain functions.According to an allosteric receptor oligomerization model, ligand
binding
