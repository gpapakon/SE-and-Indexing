<ABSTRACT>
The telescopic jib is formed by a folding arm (1), which is mounted so as to pivot on an arm support (2). It carries a telescopic element (3), which is operated by means of a jack (4). It also carries at its free end a fixing bracket (5) for the handling mechanism or similar arrangements. The telescopic element (3) takes the form of a box girder sliding inside the folding arm. At the front end, it carries a mounting plate (6) for the hydraulic attachment points (7) for the handling mechanism. At the rear end of the folding arm, is a plate (8) for the points for the hydraulic supply (9). The link between these two points (7,9) is made by pipes (10), contained within the telescopic element.

Telescopic jib for a crane, in particular for a foldable
crane, essentially consisting of a foldable arm (1) mounted

pivotally on a supporting arm (2) and accommodating a
telescopic element (3) actuated by means of a jack (4) and

provided at its free end with a nose (5) for fixing a handling
element or the like, the telescopic element (3) being in the

form of a box guided in the foldable arm (1) and being
equipped at its leading portion with plates (6) for fixing

hydraulic couplings (7) of the devices for actuating the
handling element or the like, the foldable arm (1) being

closed at its trailing portion by a plate (8) provided with
couplings (9) for connection of hydraulic pipes, and the joint

between the connecting couplings (7 and 9) for the plate (8)
of the foldable arm (1) and the plates (6) of the telescopic

element (3) being produced by means of pipes (10) consisting
of a combination of flexible pipes (11) and rigid pipes (12)

extending in the telescopic element (3) in an S-shaped loop,
the rigid pipes (12) extending along a wall of the telescopic

element (3) and being fixed at their ends to the end plates
(6) provided close to the nose (5) and to couplings (13)

provided on support plates (14) fixed to the other end of the
telescopic element (3) respectively, the flexible pipes (11)

being connected, on the one hand, to the couplings (9) of the
plate (8) of the foldable arm (1) and, on the other hand, to

the couplings (13) of the support plates (14), characterised
in that the telescopic element (3) is guided in the foldable

arm (1) by direct cooperation between its walls and those of
said foldable arm (1), in that the joining pipes (10) between

the connecting couplings (7 and 9) extend into the box forming
the telescopic element (3) on either side of the actuating

jack (4) or are in the form of flexible pipes wound spirally
round the jack (4), in that the flexible pipes (11) extend 

freely in the foldable arm (1) and in that the nose (5) for
fixing a handling element or the like consists of two cheeks

(5') which are inserted and fixed in the leading portion of
the telescopic element (3) and allow the anchoring of the jack

(4).
Jib according to claim 1, characterised in that the
flexible pipes (11) are mounted in a flexible guide means

(15).
Jib according to claim 2, characterised in that the
flexible guide means (15) is made up in the for
m of a flexible
sheath accommodating one or more pipes (11), preferably two

pipes (11).
Jib according to claim 2, characterised in that the
flexible guide means (15) consists of a sheath having

articulated links, produced from synthetic material or metal.
Jib according to claim 1, characterised in that, if the
joining pipes (10) between the connecting couplings (7 and 9)

extend into the box forming the telescopic element (3), on
either side of the actuating jack (4), the box forming the

telescopic element (3) is sub-divided into three longitudinal
compartments, namely a central compartment accommodating the

jack (4) and two lateral compartments accommodating and
guiding hydraulic pipes (10) and possibly flexible guide means

(15).
Jib according to claim 1, characterised in that the
fixing plates (6) of the hydraulic couplings (7) are mounted

removably on the cheeks (5') of the nose (5), for example by
screwing or bolting.
