<ABSTRACT>
Implant assemblies (10) and methodologies provide immuno-protection for implanted allografts, xenografts, and isografts. The assemblies and methodologies establish an improved boundary (34) between the host and the implanted cells. The boundary (34) has a pore size, an ultimate strength, and a metabolic transit value that assures the survival of the cells during the critical ischemic period and afterward. The boundary (34) allows the fabrication and clinical use of implant assemblies (10) and methodologies that can carry enough cells to be of therapeutic value to the host, yet occupy a relatively small, compact area within the host.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to systems
for implanting living cells within a host.For several years, researchers have been
trying to surgically implant living cells in a host to
treat various cell and molecular deficiency diseases.
In theory, the implanted cells will generate biological
products that the host, because of disease or injury,
cannot produce for itself. For example, the
implant assembly can contain pancreatic cells
(clusters of which are called "islets"), which generate
insulin that a diabetic host lacks.Yet, in practice, conventional implant assemblies
and methodologies usually fail to keep the
implanted cells alive long enough to provide the intended 
therapeutic benefit. For example, pancreatic
cells implanted for the treatment of diabetes usually
die or become dysfunctional within a few days or weeks
after implantation.For a period after implantation, the region
of the host tissue next to the implant assembly can be
characterized as ischemic. "Ischemic" means that
there is not a sufficient flow of blood in the tissue
region closely surrounding the implant assembly. Usually,
this ischemic condition exists during the first
two weeks of implantation. Most implanted cells fail
to live through this period.During the ischemic period, a foreign body
capsule forms around the implanted cells. The capsule
consists of flattened macrophages, foreign body giant
cells, and fibroblasts. Conventional hypotheses blame
the foreign body capsule for causing implanted cells
to die or become dysfunctional during the ischemic
period.The inventors have discovered that these
widely held hypotheses are wrong. The inventors have
discovered that the cells do not die because of the
intervention of the foreign body capsule. Instead,
the cells die because conventional implant assemblies
and methodologies themselves lack the innate capacity
to support the implanted cells' ongoing life processes
during the critical ischemic period, when the host's
vascular structures are not nearby. Because of this,
the implanted cells perish before the host can grow
new vascular structures close enough to sustain them.When implanted cells die during the ischemic
period, a classical foreign body capsule inevitably
forms around the implant. The persistent presence of
this capsule led previous researchers to the false
conclusion that the host's foreign body reaction was 
the cause of implanted cell death, rather than its
result.The invention corrects these and other
problems in existing implant assemblies.Examples of existing implant assemblies

An implant assembly (10) for a host tissue comprising
wall means defining a chamber (18) for holding cells (12) for

implantation, the wall means including means for forming a
porous boundary between the host tissue (44) and the implanted

cells in the chamber, the porous boundary
having an ultimate strength value greater than 7.0 kg/cm
2

(100 PSI); a pore
size sufficient to isolate the implanted cells from the

immune response of the host tissue; and a metabolic transit
value that sustains a flux of nutrients from the host

tissue to the implanted cells and waste products from the
implanted cells to the host tissue in the absence of close

vascular structures (54) sufficient to sustain the viability of
the implant tissue cells during the ischemic period of

implantation; characterized by the ratio between the area of the
boundary (46) and the number of implanted cells (12) being less than

200 µm
2
/cell.
An assembly (10) according to claim 1 and further including
an angiogenic material (56) that, when implanted, stimulates the

growth of vascular structures (54) by the host tissue (44) close to
the boundary to bring an end to the ischemic period.
An assembly (10) according to claim 2 wherein the angiogenic
material (56) is lung tissue, pancreatic islets, adult pancreatic ducts,

cultured fibroblasts, cultured mammary gland cells or cultured smooth
muscle cells. 
An assembly (10) according to any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the
metabolic transit value includes a permeability value for

insulin that is greater than 1.5 x 10
-4
 cm/sec.

transit value includes a porosity value that is greater

than 15%.

having an average nominal pore size between 0.6 µm and 20 µm.
An assembly (10) according to any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein
the pore size is less than 2 µm. 
An assembly (10) according to any one of claims 1 to 5
