<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process 
for the catalytic reforming of naphtha. Catalytic reforming, or hydroforming, is a well 
established industrial process employed by the petroleum 
industry for improving the octane quality of naphthas or 
straight-run gasolines. In reforming, a multifunctional 
catalyst is employed which contains a metal 
hydrogenation-dehydrogenation (hydrogen transfer) 
component, or components, substantially atomically 
dispersed upon the surface of a porous, inorganic oxide 
support, notably alumina. Platinum metal catalysts, or 
platinum to which one or more additional metal promoters 
has or have been added to form polymetallic catalysts 
are currently employed, reforming being defined as the 
total effect of the molecular changes, or hydrocarbon 
reactions, produced by dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes 
and dehydroisomerization of alkylcyclopentanes to yield 
aromatics; dehydrogenation of paraffins to yield 
olefins; dehydrocyclization of paraffins and olefins to 
yield aromatics isomerization of n-paraffins; 
isomerization cf alkylcycloparaffins to yield 
cyclohexanes; isomerization of substituted aromatics; 
and hydrocracking of paraffins which produces gas, and 
inevitably, carbonaceous material, (or "coke"), the 
latter being deposited on the catalyst.  
 During the course of a reforming operation, the 
activity of the catalyst becomes reduced, due to 
factors which include the progressive deposition of 
coke on the catalyst. The reduction in catalyst 
activity is apparent as a reduction in the amount of 
reformed high-octane naphtha. The octane number of the 
product naphtha can be maintained by raising the 
temperature of contact between the naphtha and 
catalyst, but this expedient is limited by the 
temperatures at which there is an unacceptable level of 
risk of damage to equipment used for the reforming 
process. When the maximum desirable operating 
temperature has been reached, it is necessary to 
regenerate the activity of the catalyst in order to 
restore the operation of the reforming process to 
economically useful levels. GB-A-1113547 describes a reforming unit comprising a variable number of on-oil 
reforming reactors producing high octane and lower octane reformates. At the start of 
the operation of the unit, n reactors are on-oil to produce high-octane reformate. When the last on-oil reactor becomes deactivated, it is taken offstream and the unit 
operates with n-1 reactors to produce low-octane reformate. During this operating 
period, the off-stream

<CLAIMS>
A catalytic reforming process performed in a reforming unit operated 
with a constant plural number of on-stream catalyst-containing reaction zones 

connected in series, wherein feed naphtha is passed into the first (or upstream) reaction 
zone of the on-stream series of reaction zones in the unit and product naphtha having a 

higher octane rating than the feed naphtha is recovered from the last (or downstream) 
zone of the on-stream series of reaction zones in the unit, the process comprising, in 

sequence, the steps of: 

(a) passing naphtha into and through the on-stream series of reaction 
zones of the unit and progressively increasing the temperature of at 

least the last zone of the on-stream series of zones to maintain the 
octane rating of the product naphtha at least at a given value until the 

last on-stream reaction zone of the series attains a specified maximum 
operating temperature corresponding with a specified degree of 

deactivation of the catalyst therein; 
(b) substituting a different reaction zone containing active reforming 
catalyst in place of the previous said last on-stream reaction zone of the 

series in step (a) to maintain a constant number of series-connected 
reaction zones in the unit, th
e said previous last reaction zone being 
maintained off-stream; 
(c) continuing the reforming process by passing feed naphtha through the 
on-stream series-connected reaction zones of the unit without 

regenerating/reactivating the catalyst in the said previous last reaction 
zone, and recovering a naphtha product having at least the given 

octane rating from the last on-stream reaction zone of the series;  
 
(d) progressively raising the temperature of at least the last reaction zone 
of the said on-stream series of reaction zones to maintain at least the 

given octane rating of the product naphtha until the last on-stream 
reaction zone of the series attains a given maximum operating 

temperature; 
(e) optionally repeating steps (b), (c) and (d), employing a different 
substitute reaction zone for each step (b); 
(f) interrupting the passage of naphtha into and through all the series-connected 
reaction zones of the unit, and regenerating catalyst (by 
in 
situ
 and/or 
ex situ
 regeneration) during the interruption in all the 
reaction zones employed for reforming in steps (a) to (e); and 
(g) optionally repeating steps (a) to (f). 
The process of claim 1 wherein the amount of catalyst in the last zone 
of the series in the unit comprises from 50 to 90 weight percent of the total catalyst in 

the unit. 
The process of claim 1 or claim 2 wherein the first reaction zone of the 
series in the unit contains from 5 to 20 weight percent of the total catalyst in the unit. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein in step (a), the 
temperature of the first zone is progressively raised to maintain the octane rating of the 

naphtha product. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein the unit comprises at 
least three on-stream reaction zones connected in series.  

 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein in step (a), the 
temperature of other reaction zone(s) between the first and last zones is/are 

progressively raised to maintain the octane rating of the naphtha product. 
The process of claim 5 or claim 6 wherein the amount of catalyst 
contained in the on-stream reaction zone(s) connected between the first and last zones of 

the series is in a range of from 5 to 45 weight percent of the total catalyst in the on-stream 
zones of the unit. 
The process of any one of claims 1 to 7 wherein step (f) is effected by 
in 
situ
 regeneration and reactivation of catalyst in all the reaction zones which have been 
used for naphtha reforming in the unit, the reaction zones, including used and 

deactivated reaction zone(s), being connected in series to form part of the unit for step 
(f). 
The process of claim 8 wherein, following the regeneration and 
reactivation, the regenerated/reactivated spare reaction zone(s) is/are disconnected from 

the unit, and step (a) is started.
