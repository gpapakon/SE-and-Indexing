<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a steering lock for a motor vehicle, having a securing device which, when the vehicle is parked, blocks the ability of the steering shaft to rotate, it being possible for said shaft to be blocked in both directions of rotation by a friction locking mechanism.

<CLAIMS>
A steering lock for a motor vehicle having a locking 
mechanism, which when the vehicle is turned off prevents 

the rotation of the steering shaft (7) in both directions 
of rotation,
characterised in that
 the locking mechanism is 
constructed as a friction locking mechanism (2, 3, 10) 

having several friction areas. 
A steering lock according to Claim 1,
characterised in that
 the friction of the friction 
locking mechanism (2, 3, 10) is produced by flat, 

inclined or conical friction areas. 
A steering lock according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the steering shaft axis is 
perpendicular to the plane friction areas. 
A steering lock according to Claim 2 or 3,
characterised in that
 the friction areas are formed by 
disks (3, 10) shaped in particular like annular disks. 
A steering lock according to Claim 4,
characterised in that
 disks (3), which can be rotated 
with the steering shaft (7), are mounted directly or via 

intermediate parts on the steering shaft (7), and 
rotationally secure housing disks (10) are mounted 

between these steering shaft disks (3) in alternating 
sequence.  

 
A steering lock according to Claim 5,
characterised in that
 the steering shaft disks (3) 
and the housing disks (10) are displaceable in a 

direction parallel to the steering shaft axis. 
A steering lock according to one of the preceding 
Claims 3 to 6,
characterised in that
 the steering shaft disks are 
mounted in an axially displaceable part (2), in 

particular a slide, which is mounted on the steering 
shaft (7) in a rotationally secure manner in 

relation thereto. 
A steering lock according to Claim 7,
characterised in that
 the part (2) is displaceable 
in the axial direction of the steering shaft (7) by 

rotating the steering shaft when the steering lock 
is located in the locked position. 
A steering lock according to Claim 8,
characterised in that
 during displacement the part 
(2) pressurises an outermost disk (10) of the disk 

assembly. 
A steering lock according to one of Claims 7 to 9,
characterised in that
 the part (2) is axially 
displaceable by the inclined surfaces (11a, 11b, 

12a, 12b) of a wedge or helical gear. 
A steering lock according to Claim 10,
characterised in that
 the part (2) has first 
inclined surfaces (12a, 12b) and the steering shaft 

(7) or a part (6) connected to the steering shaft 
(pressure cam) has second inclined surfaces (11a, 

11b) adjacent thereto.  
 
A steering lock according to one of the preceding 
Claims 7 to 11,
characterised in that
 the part (2) can be moved into 
the unlocked position by a carrier (5), which can be 

moved by a closing cylinder (8) and/or by a drive 
(9) in particular via a cam in each case. 
A steering lock according to Claim 12,
characterised in that
 the carrier (5) is stressed by 
a spring element (16) towards the locked position.
