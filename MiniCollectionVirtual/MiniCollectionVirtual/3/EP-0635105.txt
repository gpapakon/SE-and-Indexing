<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a swivel link, particularly for use for rotative interconnection of two relative pivotable machine/building construction parts (1, 2) or similar mutually articulated members at the adjacent end portions thereof, said swivel link comprising a bolt (4) and two expandable, internally conical sleeves (5', 5"), wherein the bolt (4) is formed with two oppositely directed, conically tapering end portions (4', 4") each intended to be positioned in an attachment hole (3) therefor and to cooperate with one of said internally conical sleeves (5', 5"), each assigned a nut (6, 7) for axially directed displacement of the respective internally conical sleeve (5', 5"), in order to bring the latter into surrounding engagement with the associated conical bolt end portion (4', 4") within respective attachment hole (3), and wherein the bolt (4) is formed with a through-going, central, axially directed bore (8) for rotative accommodating a shaft (9) having threaded portions for said nuts (6, 7). The object of the invention is to enable the tightening of one nut by means of the through-going shaft. To this end, this nut (7) and the adjacent bolt portion (4") are provided with mutually cooperating guide/retainer means (15, 16) preventing rotation of the nut (7) in relation to the bolt (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a swivel link, especially for use 
in rotative interconnection of two relatively pivotable 
machine or building or construction members or similar interhinged 
parts at their adjacent end portions, wherein one of said 
members respectively parts, which may be bifurcated, is formed with two aligned 
swivel link attachment holes, said swivel link comprising 
one bolt and two expandable, internally conical sleeves, 
wherein the bolt is formed with two opposite directed, 
conically tapering end portions each intended to be placed 
in an attachment hole and each to cooperate with an 
internally conical sleeve, each of which is assigned a nut 
for axial displacement of the respective internally conical 
sleeve, in order to bring it into surrounding engagement 
with the associated conical bolt end portion within the 
respective attachment hole, and wherein the bolt is formed 
with a through-going, central, axially directed bore for rotative 
accommodation of a shaft having threaded end portions for 
said nuts. Such a swivel link is e.g. known from WO-A-9 015 262 and is used where space conditions do not 
allow tightening of one of the nuts by means of an 
appropriate tool, i.e. in cases where one does not reach 
the nut outside one attachment.  
 Likewise, it is previously known that the through-going 
shaft has a key groove in the end having free access. Upon 
rotation of the shaft from the end to which one has free 
access, it is intended that the non-accessible nut shall be 
displaced axially without any rotation, in order to, during 
the axial displacement thereof, to push the associated 
internally conical sleeve, often designated the cone sleeve, 
onto the adjacent conical end portion of the bolt, whereby 
the cone sleeve is brought to expand radially while wedging 
itself into the space between the conical end portion of the 
bolt and the internal wall defining the respective 
attachment hole. In order to allow this known swivel link to function 
according to the purpose thereof, it is, of course, a 
presupposition that the non-accessible nut does not rotate 
with the through-going shaft. Such an undesirable nut 
rotation is, however, very difficult, if not impossible, to 
avoid. In practice, when this prior art swivel joint is to be 
mounted, it has been found that the non-accessible nut has 
not be tightened properly, because it has turned around as 
the through-going shaft was screwed around from the 
available end thereof. In fact, nothing prevents the non-accessible 
nut

<CLAIMS>
A swivel link, particularly for use for rotative 
interconnecting two relative pivotable machine or building or 

construction parts (1, 2) or similar mutually articulated 
members at their adjacent end portions, wherein one (1) of 

said parts (1, 2), which may be bifurcated, is formed with two 
aligned swivel link attachment holes (3), said swivel link 

comprising a bolt (4) and two expandable, internally conical 
sleeves (5', 5"), wherein the bolt (4) is formed with two 

oppositely directed, conically tapering end portions (4', 
4") each intended to be positioned within an attachment hole 

(3) and to cooperate with one of the internally conical 
sleeves (5', 5"), each of which being assigned a nut (6, 7) 

for axially directed displacement of the respective 
internally conical sleeve (5', 5"), in order to bring the 

latter in surrounding engagement with the associated conical 
bolt end portion (4', 4") within the respective attachment 

hole (3), and wherein the bolt (4) is formed with a through-going, 
central, axially directed bore (8) for rotative 

accommodation of a shaft (9) having threaded portions for 
said nuts (6, 7), 
characterized in
 that said shaft (9), adjacent one end portion 
(9') thereof, has a stop flange (10) which may be brought 

to rest supportingly against the adjacent gable face of the 
bolt (4), and at least 

one nut (7) and the adjacent bolt portion (4") have mutually 
cooperating guide and retainer means (15, 16) preventing the 

rotation of the nut (7) in relation to the bolt (4), but 
allowing relative axially directed displacement movement. 
A swivel link as set forth in claim 1, 

characterized in
 that said guide and retainer 
means comprises at least one axially directed guide and retainer 

pin (15) eccentrically positioned with respect to the axis 
(A) of the swivel link, said pin or pins (15), respectively, 

preferably being attached to the bolt (4), while the  
 

cooperating guide and retainer means of the nut (7) is 
constituted by one or more axially directed bores (16), in 

which the pin(s) (15) is respectively are guided during longitudinal 
displacement. 
A swivel link as set forth in claim 1 or 2, 

characterized in
 that at least one (5") of 
the internally conical sleeves (5', 5") is divided along at 

least one axial plane such that the assembled sleeve 
halves respectively parts in unexpanded condition exhibit a smaller 

largest diameter than the diameter measured with expanded 
circular circumferential shape, such that the internally 

conical sleeve (5") in question, in unexpanded condition may 
be conducted through a bore (2') having a diameter smaller 

than the outside diameter of the sleeve (5") in expanded 
condition. 
A swivel link as set forth in one or more of the 
preceding claims, wherein at least one nut (7) has an 

external circumferential groove (14) for the accommodation 
of a radially inwardly directed flange (13) on a cooperating 

cone sleeve (5"), c h a r a c t e r i z e d i n that the 
respective nut (7) in the area of said circumferential 

groove (14) has a radially outwardly directed flange (22) 
which rests, respectively may be brought to rest, against an 

opposing, radially directed face on the radially inwardly
