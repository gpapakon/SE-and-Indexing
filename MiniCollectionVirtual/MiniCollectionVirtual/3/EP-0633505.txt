<ABSTRACT>
A process and device for adjusting distance for purposes of 
parallel positioning of a workpiece (w) relative to a mask (11) 

at a preset distance. A 
workpiece is held at a distance from a mask on a work-holding 

fixture (10) 
and one of the work-holding fixture (10) and a mask carrier (11,10) 

carrying the 
mask is moved by a moving device (31) toward the other to bring the 

workpiece into contact with the mask. After such contact has 
occurred, movement of the moving device is continued until a signal is 

transmitted to a system controller from each of at least three alignment 
devices which are arranged on the work-holding fixture or the mask 

carrier, the alignment devices having calibration devices (40) which 
essentially begin to move when the workpiece 

and mask come into contact with one another and can no longer execute 
any further relative movement. Movement of the work-holding fixture 

or the mask carrier is stopped when the system controller receives a 
signal from all of the calibration devices, which is thus assessed as 

achievement of a parallel alignment of the workpiece and mask relative 
to one another, at which time the displacement of the calibration device 

of each alignment device is fixed. Thereafter, the direction of 
movement of the one of the work-holding fixture and the mask carrier 

is reversed until the desired spacing distance is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process and a device for adjusting the
distance between a workpiece and a mask in an exposure device which
is used in the process of manufacturing a semiconductor device.Conventionally, so-called proximity exposure is done in which
a workpiece and a mask are arranged at microscopically small distance
to one another. In doing so, a semiconductor wafer or a glass
substrate for a liquid crystal display is used for a workpiece. In the
following, a workpiece is representatively called a wafer.Fig. 12 schematically shows a proximity exposure device. Emitted
light from light source 1 is incident by means of oval reflector 2 on
integrator lens 3. Output light from integrator lens 3, after one
passage through collimation lens 4, passes through mask M, on which
a circuit pattern and the like are drawn, and irradiates wafer W. A
distance between mask M and wafer W is roughly 20 micrometers, with a
tolerance of no more than 2 micrometers.The aforementioned "microcoscopic distance" was usually
attained in such a way that a carrier with a spherical seat system is
moved up and down relative to the mask M. Fig. 11 shows a device
using such a spherical seat system.Carrier 5 on which a wafer W is placed is located on spherical
seat 6. Carrier 5 is provided with vacuum line 8 for drawing the wafer
onto carrier 5 by suction. Spherical seat 6 is provided with a vacuum 
line 9 for holding carrier 5 on the spherical seat 6. Vacuum lines 8 and
9 are connected to a vacuum suction holder which is not shown in the
drawing. Spherical seat 6 can be moved up and down by means a
moving device 7. In a device of this type, the processes described
below are executed:First, carrier 5 is lowered sufficiently by means of the moving
device 7. In this state wafer W is seated on carrier 5. Then, wafer W
is drawn against carrier 5 by operation of the vacuum suction holder
and vacuum line 8. While the wafer W is held against the carrier 5, it
is raised in the direction toward mask M by the moving device 7. In
this case, the vacuum line 9 is not yet activated and spherical seat 6
and carrier 5 are arranged in a free positional relationship to one
another.After raising wafer W until it comes into contact with mask M,
moving device 7, and thus upwards motion of wafer W, are stopped.
Carrier 5 is tilted in this case by means of spherical seat 6, so that it
is located parallel to mask M. In this way, a parallel positional
relationship between wafer W and mask M is achieved.Next, carrier 5 is drawn by suction onto spherical

A process for adjusting distance for purposes of parallel
positioning of a wafer spaced at a set distance relative to a mask,

comprising the steps of:

a) holding a workpiece (W) on a work-holding fixture (10) spaced
at a distance from a mask (M);
b) operating a moving device (31) for moving the work-holding
fixture and/or a mask carrier (M10) on which the mask is disposed in a

first direction to bring the workpiece into contact with the mask;
c) continuing the operation of the moving device after the
workpiece comes into contact with the mask;
d) transmitting a signal to a system controller from each of at least
three means for alignment which are arranged on the

work-holding fixture or the mask carrier and which essentially
begin to move and accept a propulsive force from the moving

device beginning at a time at which the workpiece and mask come
into contact with one another and essentially can no longer

execute any further relative motion therebetween, when a
determined amount of displacement of calibration devices (40) of the

alignment means has occurred;
e) discontinuing the operation of the moving device, stopping the
movement of the work-holding fixture and/or the mask

carrier, when the system controller has received said signal
from each of said means for alignment, and maintaining constant

a parallel alignment of the workpiece and mask relative to one
another determined on the basis of the signals in each of the

means for alignment by fixing of the calibration device thereof;
f) moving the work-holding fixture and/or the mask of
carrier by the set distance in a second direction, opposite to

said first direction, to position the wafer as said workpiece at the set distance
relative to the mask.
A device for adjusting the distance between a workpiece (W) and
a mask (M) comprising a work-holding fixture (10) for holding a workpiece, a

mask carrier (M10) for holding a mask, a moving device for moving one of the
work-holding fixture and the mask carrier toward and away from the

other for moving the workpiece and the mask closer to one another and
further from one another, and at least three means for aligning

connected between said one of the work-holding fixture and the mask
carrier and the moving device;

   wherein the means for aligning contain calibration devices (40) which
are arranged to be displaced and to accept a propulsive force from the

moving device upon engagement of the workpiece with the mask by
continued operation of the moving device in a first direction

corresponding to movement of the workpiece toward the mask after
relative motion between the workpiece and the mask is essentially no
