<ABSTRACT>
A device for treating products, especially fruit and vegetables, in a closed treatment space (4, 36) has at least one essentially cylindrical casing element (3) which is displaceably arranged between two side walls (1). The end sections of the casing element (3) have axially extensible parts and/or clamping jaws (8), by means of which the end sections can be brought into contact with the side walls (1) to form the closed treatment space (4, 36).

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for treating products in a closed 
treatment space, characterized by at least one essentially 

cylindrical jacket element (3) with movable end 
sections, which is arranged between two side walls (1) in 

a manner separated from the latter, the end sections of 
the jacket element (3) being capable of being brought 

into contact with the side walls (1) to form a closed 
treatment space (4; 36). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one jacket element (3) is arranged displaceably 

between the side walls (1). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that at least one jacket element (3) is arranged in a 

fixed manner between the side walls (1). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 

characterized in that the side walls (1) are arranged 
parallel to one another and perpendicular to the axis of 

the jacket element (3). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the side walls (1) are arranged 

obliquely to one another and to the axis of the jacket 
element (3). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized by a plurality of jacket elements (3) 

arranged with their axes parallel to one another to form 
a plurality of mutually separate treatment spaces (4; 36) 

between the side walls (1). 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the jacket elements (3) are arranged in a revolver-like 

manner between the side walls (1) on a common tube  
 

element (23). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that the end sections of the jacket 

element (3) or of each jacket element (3) have axially 
extendable parts (8) by means of which the end sections 

can be brought into contact with the side walls (1) to 
form the closed treatment space (4; 36). 
Apparatus according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the extendable parts are clamping jaws (8), each 

clamping jaw (8) having a section (9) which lies axially 
opposite an end face (7) of the jacket element (3) and 

which is separated, at least after having been brought 
into contact with the side wall (1), from the opposite 

end face (7) by an annular gap (11) which is open towards 
the treatment space (4; 36), with the result that the 

clamping jaw (8) can be pressed against the side wall (1) 
by a pressure acting in the treatment space (4; 36). 
Apparatus according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that at least one clamping jaw (8) is connected to the 

jacket element (3) by means of a compensator (32). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 10, 
characterized in that a product container (13) accommodated 

in the jacket element (3) is mounted in the 
jacket element (3). 
Apparatus according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the product container (13) is a circular-cylindrical 

screening drum which can be closed at the end. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 12, 
characterized in that at least one side wall (1) has an 

opening (12) for the horizontal introduction or horizontal 
removal of the product container (13). 
Apparatus according to Claim 13, characterized by 
a plate (38; 39) which can be pivoted parallel to the 

respective side wall (1) and, in a position in which it 
closes the opening (12), can be pressed into sealing 

contact between the side wall (1) and the opposite 
clamping jaw (8). 
Apparatus according to Claim 14, characterized in 
that the plate (38; 39) is provided with seals (42) on  

 
both sides. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 10 to 15, 
characterized in that an encapsulation (34) is in each 

case arranged between the clamping jaws (8) and the side 
walls (1) and, by means of this encapsulation, a 

connection between the treatment space (36) and the 
outside is prevented even when the clamping jaws (8) have 

been raised from the respective side wall (1). 
Apparatus according to Claim 16, characterized in 
that the encapsulation (34) is a compensator connected to 

the respective clamping jaw (8) and the opposite side 
wall (1). 
Apparatus according to Claim 16, characterized in 
that the encapsulation (34) is connected to the respective 

side wall (1) on one side and is in contact by way 
of a sliding seal (35) with the in-contact clamping jaw 

(8), thus allowing the clamping jaw (8) to be displaced 
along the seal (35) to close the treatment space (36). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 18, 
characterized in that each side wall (1) has a sealing 

element (20; 24; 25) opposite the cylindrical jacket 
element (3). 
Apparatus according to Claim 19, characterized in 
that the sealing element is a sealing ring (20) of one-piece 

design with the side wall. 
Apparatus according to Claim 19, characterized in 
that the sealing element is a sealing washer (24; 25), in 

particular a sealing washer made of a nonmetallic 
material. 
Apparatus according to Claim 21, characterized in 
that the sealing washer (25) has a centrally arranged 

opening (26), into which opening a gaseous or liquid 
medium can be introduced under pressure through a passage 

(27) provided in the in-contact side wall (1). 
Apparatus according to Claim 22, characterized in 
that the passage (27) is formed by a plurality of holes 

arranged along the sealing washer (25) and the medium 
passed through them is compressed air. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 23,  
 

characterized by a product container with a cylindrical 
wall (45) to which holders (46) are attached diametrically 

opposite one another in pairs and arranged spaced 
apart in a line parallel to the axis of the product 

container (13). 
Apparatus according to Claim 24, characterized in 
that a pair of holders (46) is arranged centrally on the 

product container (13). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 24 or 25, 
characterized in that at least one pair of holders (46) 

has freely rotatable rollers (47), the axis of rotation 
of which is perpendicular to the axis of the product 

container (13). 
Apparatus according to Claim 26, characterized in 
that the rollers (47) have a depression (53) on their 

circumference.
