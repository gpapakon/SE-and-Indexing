<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns melt-spun polyethylene fibres having a high strength.A conventional method for manufacturing fibres from synthetic polymers is spinning with
spinnerettes, where a polymer brought in flowing state is pressed through holes and the
fibres being formed are stretched, whereby the fibres become thinner and an orientation
of molecular chains takes place in the longitudinal direction of the fibres. Depending on
how the polymer used in the manufacturing of the fibres is brought into a flowing state,
it is referred for example to solution-spun, gel-spun and melt-spun fibres.Mixtures of a polymer and a solvent are used as raw material for fibres both in solution
spinning and gel spinning, which in view of the industrial production of the fibres is a
drawback bringing increased costs. Firstly, in the fibre production it is necessary to use
extra chemicals (solvents, swelling agents), the adding and recovery of which from the
fibres cause additional costs. Secondly, the presence of extra chemicals in the fibre
manufacturing process decreases the production capacity. Although at present it can be
produced by gel-spinning polyethylene fibres having a strength comparable to that of
carbon fibres or even greater, the high manufacturing costs of this kind of fibres prevent
wider usage of the fibres in industrial applications.Compared to the former methods the melt spinning is simpler, because the polymer is
simply melted in an extruder and pressed through holes. The extra costs and drawbacks
related to the use of additional chemicals can thereby be avoided. By melt spinning it is
also possible to produce polyethylene fibres at sufficently high production rate.Recently a lot of research work has been carried out for developing processes for the
production of high strength polyethylene fibres to replace higher priced carbon fibres and
LCP-fibres. Very many factors have influence on the quality of the fibres obtained and on
the strength properties. Such factors are among others the properties of the polyethylene
used as raw material, the spinning conditions such as the temperature, the dimensions and
contours of the spinning holes and especially the conditions used in the stretching. Among
the properties of the fibre raw material the molecular weight has appeared to be especially 
important.Concerning the prior art it is referred among others to GB-patent publications 1498628
and 1568964. In the method according to the first mentioned patent polyethylene having
