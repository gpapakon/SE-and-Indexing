<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns 22-ene-25-oxa derivatives of the vitamin D series of general formula (I), in which R1, R2 and R4, independently of each other, may each be a hydrogen atom, an alkanoyl group with 1 to 9 carbon atoms or an aroyl group; each R3 may be a hydrogen atom, a straight-chain or branched-chain alkyl group with 1 to 4 carbon atoms or a trifluoromethyl group, or the two R3 groups, together with the tertiary carbon atom to which they are attached, may form a saturated or unsaturated 3-, 4-, 5- or 6-membered carboxyclic or heterocyclic ring; and X is an alkylene group of the formula -(CH2)n- in which n = 1, 2 or 3. The invention also concerns a method of preparing such derivatives and their pharmaceutical use in the treatment of hyperproliferative diseases.
