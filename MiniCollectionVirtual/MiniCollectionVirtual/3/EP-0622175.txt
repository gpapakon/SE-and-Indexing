<ABSTRACT>
A hand-operated press has a manually operable lever (60), the downward movement of which corresponds to the pressure stroke and the return movement of which corresponds to the release stroke. The actuating lever (60) is connected to a return stroke lock (10 to 50) which only permits backward movement of the actuating lever (60) when the bottom dead centre has been reached. The return stroke lock (10 to 50) has a bearing disc (20) and a cam plate (10) which is coaxial with and arranged at a small axial distance from the latter. The bearing disc (20), directs a locking bolt (40) which is displaceable both radially and axially and is forcibly guided in a radial cam (11) of the cam plate (10). The cam plate (10) is coupled via a swivel pin (50) to the actuating lever (60), so that the reciprocating movement of the press slide is converted into a rotary movement of the cam plate (10). The radial cam (11) has four different cam sections (11a, 11b, 11c, 11d) which form an inherently closed partial cam section, through which it is possible to pass in only one direction. This ensures that premature initiation of the return stroke is effectively impeded before the bottom dead centre is reached. The interplay according to the invention of the blocking pins (40) and the radial cam (11) can result in the formation of a return stroke lock (10 to 50) which has extremely small dimensions and uses extremely simple components. According to a preferred embodiment, an unlocking facility is provided for the return stroke lock (10 to 50). According to a further embodiment, the cam plate (10) can be adjusted in relation to the swivel pin (50) so that any desired bottom dead centre positions can be set.

<CLAIMS>
A manually-operable press having an operating lever (60) 
swivellable manually around an axis, the downward 

movement of which corresponds to the press stroke and the 
reverse movement of which corresponds to the tension 

release stroke (return stroke) of the press and which is 
connected to a return stroke locking device (10-50), 

which only releases the reverse movement of the 
operating lever (60) when the end point of the downward 

movement is reached, wherein a radially displaceably 
mounted locking pin (40) is restrictedly guided in a 

groove-shaped cam (11) provided in a cam support so that 
a section of the cam in itself closed can only be moved in 

the direction corresponding to the downward movement of 
the operating lever (60),
 
characterised in that a bearing plate (20) is mounted on 

the press, which bears a sliding block (30) radially 
inwardly displaceable against the action of a spring 

(39), which in turn contains a locking pin (40) which is 
axially outwardly moveable against the action of a spring 

(49),
 
in that the cam support is connected as a cam plate (10) 

coaxially at a slight axial distance from the bearing 
plate (20) in a rotationally secure manner to a swivel 

pin (50) passed coaxially and rotatably through the 
bearing plate (20), which pin is coupled indirectly or 

directly with the operating lever (60),
 
and in that the cam (11) has four cam portions (11a, 11b, 

11c, 11d), namely 

a. an arc-shaped free stroke portion (11a) having a 
constant groove depth, 
b. a following return stroke locking portion (11b) 
having a groove depth enlarged in the manner of a 

step,  
 
c. a roughly radially extending releasing portion (11c) 
and 
d. a return portion (11d) having a continuously 
decreasing groove depth and a step-like transition 

into the free stroke portion (11a). 
A press according to Claim 1,
 
characterized in that the return stroke locking portion 

(11b) and the releasing portion (11c) are constructed as 
axially continuous, slit-shaped recesses in the cam plate 

(10). 
A press according to Claim 1 or 2,
 
characterised in that the axial displacement of the 

locking pin (40) is limited by end stops. 
A press according to one of the preceding Claims,
 
characterised in that the angular position of the cam 

plate (10) is adjustable in relation to the swivel pin 
(50).
