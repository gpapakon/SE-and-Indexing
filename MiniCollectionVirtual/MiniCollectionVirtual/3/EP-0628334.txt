<CLAIMS>
A filter for filtering a fluid, comprising:

a cassette (4) for filtering the fluid adapted to
deliver a filtered fluid and including a cassette body

equipped with a filter membrane, said cassette body
having a lateral extension including a portion (42) that

can be cut off and separated completely from the
remainder of the cassette, and
a filter body (2) including a fluid inlet
communicating with a housing for said filter cassette

(4), an outlet for the filtered fluid, locking/unlocking
means operable between a position for locking the filter

cassette in its housing and a position for unlocking the
filter cassette, 
characterized in that
 said body includes
cutting means (31, 35) actuated by the locking/unlocking

means on passing from their locking position to their
unlocking position to cut the part (42) of the filter

cassette that can be cut off, and safety means (44, 35,
50) adapted to prevent the locking/unlocking means

locking into its housing a filter cassette from which the
part (42) that can be cut off has been amputated.
A filter according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the locking/unlocking means include a toothed wheel
(20) adapted to be rotated between a locking position and

an unlocking position, the housing of the cassette (4)

includes an ancillary part (100) adapted to accommodate
the part (42) of said cassette that can be cut off, and

the cutting means include a first rack (31) cooperating
with the toothed wheel (20) and guided in a passage (102)

of the body opening into the ancillary housing (100) of
the cassette in the direction of the part (42) of the

cassette (4) that can be cut off on moving from the
locking position to the unlocking position and a cutting

member (35) adapted to penetrate said ancillary housing
part of the cassette on movement of the first rack (31) 

to cut off the part (42) of the cassette (4) that can be
cut off.
A filter according to claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the locking/unlocking means include a second rack
(3) cooperating with said toothed wheel (20), guided in

translation and having at one end bearing means adapted
to come into contact with the filter cassette (4) in the

locking position and to be held away from the cassette in
the unlocking position, and the safety means include an

immobilizing member (50) housed in an auxiliary housing
(102) of the body, opening into said ancillary housing

part of the cassette, movably mounted in the auxiliary
housing to penetrate said ancillary housing part of the

cassette after the part (42) of the latter that can be
cut off has been cut off, and adapted to assume an

immobilizing position in which it cooperates with the
cutting member (35) to prevent retrograde movement

thereof in the passage and thereby prevent the return of
the locking/unlocking means to their locking position

until a part of a new cassette that can be cut off is
inserted in said ancillary part of the housing of the

cassette.
A filter according to claim 3, 
characterized in
that
, in said immobilizing position of the immobilizing
member (50), the cutting member (35) at least partly

shuts off said ancillary housing part, the part (42) of
the cassette (4) that can be cut off and the cutting

member (35) have predetermined conjugate profiles (R, R1)
adapted to cooperate with each other to allow insertion

of the part (42) that can be cut off in said ancillary
housing part during insertion of the cassette into its

housing, and the part that can be cut off when inserted
in this way into the ancillary housing part is adapted to

move the immobilizing member from its immobilizing
position to a releasing position in which it has no 

contact with the cutting member and allows retrograde
movement thereof and return of the locking/unlocking

means to their locking position.
A filter according to claim 4, 
characterized in
that
 the immobilizing member (50) is spring-loaded (51)
into its releasing position and the filter includes

auxiliary immobilizing means (45, 46) for immobilizing
the part (42) of the cassette that can be cut off in said

ancillary housing part.
A filter according to any of claims 1 to 5,

characterized in that
 the lateral extension (41) is
provided with a relatively weaker area (43).
A filter according to any of claims 1 to 6,

characterized in that
 the cassette body is provided with
a passage through it shut off by a filter membrane (210,

310) fixed to a membrane support accommodated in the
cassette body and mounted so that it can move in

translation relative to the cassette body in a direction
substantially parallel to the general direction of the

passage.
A method of replacing a filter cassette locked
into a housing of a filter as defined in any of claims 1

to 7, 
characterized in that
, on actuation of the
locking/unlocking means, the part of the cassette that

can be cut off is cut off and the cassette is amputated
completely from the part that can be cut off so that the

cassette can be extracted from the housing and the
locking of a replacement cassette from which the part

that can be cut off has been amputated is prevented by
preventing actuation of the locking/unlocking means.
