<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the use of lysates
of keratinocytes as wound healing substances.The invention also relates to pharmaceutical
compositions containing as active substances, said lysates
of keratinocytes.The invention also relates to cosmetic
compositions, containing as active substances, lysates
of keratinocytes.Skin is presumably the organ most subject to
injury. Skin repair is a complex process that can be
divided in 4 phases usually described as inflammation,
granulation tissue formation, epithelialization and
remodeling of the connective tissue matrix. Each of
these phases is complex in itself, and it is clear that
for good wound healing, the processes must occur
successively and in coordination. Good wound healing
can be defined as restoration of the skin, including
the dermal and epidermal part, in such a way that the
resulting scar tissue maximally resembles the unwounded
skin structurally, histologically, functionally, and
esthetically. Obviously, such scar tissue is different
from a hypertrophic scar or keloid.For purposes of clarity a simplified description
of the composition of human skin is given below. The
upper part is composed of the epidermis, which contains
mostly keratinocyte or epithelial cells, some
melanocytes and Langerhans cells, and several Merkel
cells. Five different layers are found in the
epidermis, reflecting the state of keratinization. The 
proliferating keratinocytes at the base of the
epidermis, i.e., in the stratum basale, are attached to
the dermis via the basement membrane. The dermis is
composed of connective tissue, including fibroblasts
and other connective tissue cells, and connective
tissue matrix substances. Blood vessels, nerves,
sensory organs, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, and
hair follicles are present in the dermis.Clinical and animal experiments have demonstrated
that application of invitro cultured (human)
keratinocytes, for instance as sheets, induces wound
healing in chronic wounds such as ulcers and in burns,
which may be treated concomitantly with meshed split
skin autografts. Moreover, there are indications that
the application of cultured keratinocyte grafts
suppresses hypertrophic scar formation and keloid
formation. Initially, autografts were used, which were
prepared by growing keratinocytes isolated from the
patients own skin. Confluent (differentiated)
keratinocyte cultures are then detached from the
culture dish and applied as a sheet, with basal cells
facing downwards on the wound. About 3 weeks are needed
before a reasonable amount
