<ABSTRACT>
Device for fixing a glare foil on a metal safety barrier placed on the central reservation separating motor vehicle traffic lanes. It consists of a support plate (2) which can be secured to the rear of a metal barrier (1, 6) by means of a flange (3, 3') consisting of a wire (30), the ends (31, 32) of which abut, and which is folded in such a way as, on the one hand, to exhibit some degree of transverse and longitudinal elasticity and, on the other hand, to be capable of matching at a distance the rear contour of the said barrier (1, 6), while covering its longitudinal edges (13, 14) above and below the said support plate (2), passing on either side of the latter.

<CLAIMS>
A device for fixing an anti-dazzle blade on a metal
security barrier placed on the central reserve between

motor traffic carriageways, the device being
characterized in that it comprises a support plate (2)

securable to the back of a metal barrier (1, 6) by means
of a clip (3, 3') constituted by a metal wire (30) whose

ends (31, 32) are placed end-to-end, and which is folded
in such a manner that firstly it presents a certain

amount of transverse and longitudinal resilience, and
secondly it is capable of fitting over the rear outline

of said barrier (1, 6) at a distance therefrom, overlying
its longitudinal edges (13, 14) above and below said

support plate (2), and passing on either side thereof.
A device according to claim 1, characterized in that
the support plate (2) has firstly, in its top portion

(20), on its edge in contact with the barrier (1), a
transverse groove (22) suitable for receiving the edge

(15) of said barrier (1); secondly, behind said groove
(22), projecting on either side of the flanks of the

support plate (2), two studs (23) of substantially round
section; and thirdly on either side of its bottom portion

(21), projecting elements (24) defining vertical grooves
(25); the width of the support plate (2) being greater

than the distance between the two facing segments (33,

34) of the clip (3).
A device according to claim I or claim 2,
characterized in that the support plate (2) is made in

two portions, a plate portion (4) having the lateral
studs (23) and the blade fixing means, and a support

portion (5) comprising the transverse and vertical
grooves (22, 25), these two portions (4, 5) being

reversibly securable to each other. 
A device according to claim 3, characterized in that
the plate (4) is securable to the support (5) firstly by

inserting a transverse flange (41) projecting from the
front of the plate (4) into a transverse groove (51)

formed in register with the transverse groove (22) inside
said support (5), and secondly by means of resilient

studs (42) which are disposed to project outwards on the
flanks (42) of the bottom front portion (40) of the plate

(4) and which are insertable into orifices (52) formed in
the flanks (53) of the top portion (50) of the support

(5).
A device according to any preceding claim,
characterized in that the studs (23) have respective

chamfers (26) facing the barrier (1, 6).
