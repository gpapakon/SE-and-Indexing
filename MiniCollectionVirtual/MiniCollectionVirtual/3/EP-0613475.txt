<ABSTRACT>
Described are novel reversible photochromic naphthopyran compounds having at least one ortho substituted phenyl group at the 3-position of the pyran ring. Also described are organic host materials that contain or that are coated with such compounds. Articles such as ophthalmic lenses or other plastic transparencies that incorporate the novel naphthopyran compound or combinations thereof with complementary photochromic compounds, e.g., spiro(indolino)-oxazine type compounds, are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to certain novel naphthopyran
compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to novel
photochromic naphthopyran compounds, and to compositions and articles
containing such novel naphthopyran compounds. When exposed to light
radiation involving ultraviolet rays, such as the ultraviolet
radiation in sunlight or the light of a mercury lamp, many
photochromic compounds exhibit a reversible change in color. When the
ultraviolet radiation is discontinued, such a photochromic compound
will return to its original color or colorless state.Various classes of photochromic compounds have been
synthesized and suggested for use in applications in which a
sunlight-induced reversible color change or darkening is desired.
U.S. Patent 3,567,605 (Becker) describes a series of pyran
derivatives, including certain benzopyrans and naphthopyrans. These
compounds are described as derivatives of chromene and are reported to
undergo a color change, e.g., from colorless to yellow-orange, on
irradiation by ultraviolet light at temperatures below about -40°C.
Irradiation of the compounds with visible light or upon raising the
temperature to within the range of -10°C. to 0°C. is reported to
reverse the coloration to a colorless state. U.S. patent 4,563,458
describes certain 2H-chromenes as precursors of certain
chroman-4-aldehydes, which are reacted with certain amines to prepare
4-aminomethylene-chromans and -chromenes that are used in medicaments.European Patent Publication 246,114 describes a series of
photochromic spiropyrans in which an adamantane group is attached at
the position adjacent to the oxygen in the pyran ring. United States
Patent 4,818,096 and European Patent Publication 250,193 describe
photoreactive plastic lenses that are coated or impregnated with the
photochromic spiropyrans of European Patent Publication 246,114 in
combination with a blue photochromic benzopyran or naphthopyran having
an aminophenyl substituent at the position adjacent to the oxygen in
the pyran ring. European Patent Publication 294,056 describes a 
process for producing a polyurethane plastic having photochromic
properties. Reversible cleavage photochromic compounds disclosed
therein include a naphthopyran derivative in which the pyran ring is
substituted at the position adjacent to the oxygen in the pyran ring
with di(p-methoxyphenyl) substituents.Padwa et al in J. Org. Chem., Volume 40, No. 8, 1975, page
1142, describes the investigation of photochemical reactions of
2,2-dimethylbenzopyran and related
