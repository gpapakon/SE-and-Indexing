<ABSTRACT>
A tape cassette (1) including a cassette case (2) having a pair of tape reels (11) having a 
recording tape (10) wound therebetween and having an opening (6) for providing access 

to the recording tape (10); a main lid (24) pivotably mounted on opposite side faces of 
the cassette case (2); a top lid (34) pivotably mounted on the main lid (24); and a guide 

apparatus. Upon opening or closing the main lid (24) so as to provide access to the 
magnetic tape (10), the top lid (34) is respecively moved rearwardly from a postion in 

which the top lid (34) covers an upper portion of the opening (6) or forwardly so as to 
cover the upper portion of the opening (6). The guide apparatus guides the top lid (34) 

during such movement thereof so as to avoid sliding or rubbing of a lower face of the 
top lid (34) on an upper face of the cassette case (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tape cassette and,
more particularly, to a tape cassette having a cassette case with
a recording tape contained therein and a pivotably movable main
lid and top lid for covering and uncovering at least a portion of
an opening in the cassette care so to provide access to the
recording tape.A tape cassette for use with a recording/reproducing
apparatus has recently been proposed having a cassette case with
a mouth or opening formed in the front of the cassette case
through which a tape drawing out member of the
recording/reproducing apparatus may be inserted upon installation
of the tape cassette therein. Such tape cassette includes a main
lid and a top lid for respectively covering a front and a top
portion of the opening. An example of one of these tape
cassettes is illustrated in Figs. 24 and 25.More specifically, Figs. 24 and 25 illustrate a tape
cassette a including a cassette case b which contains therein a
pair of rotatably mounted tape reels d having a magnetic tape c
wound therebetween. A pair of tape exits e are formed at
opposite left and right end portions of the front of the cassette
case b. A mouth or opening f is formed between the tape exits e. Unless otherwise specifically mentioned, in describing
the tape cassette a, the front of the tape cassette shall be
defined as the portion having a main lid g, the back or rear of
the tape cassette shall be defined as the portion opposite the
front, and the top portion shall be defined as the portion having
a top lid j.The tape cassette a further includes the main lid g
having a front portion h and a pair of side portions i. The
front portion h has a size which is sufficient to cover the front
of the cassette case b. The side portions i extend in a rearward
direction from opposite left and right ends of the front portion
h. The side portions i are pivotably supported on side faces of
a front end portion of the cassette case b so as to support the
main lid g in upward and downward pivotal motion at the front end
portion of the cassette case b between a closed position (see
Fig. 24), in which the main lid closes the front of the cassette
case b, and an opened position (see Fig. 25), in which the main
lid is opened so as to expose or provide access to the front of
the cassette case b.The tape cassette a further includes a top lid j having
a plate-like form with a length smaller than that of the main lid
g. The top lid j is pivotably supported at opposite left and
right end portions of a front end portion thereof by an

A tape cassette (19) comprising:

a pair of tape reels (11) having a recording tape (10) wound therebetween;
a cassette case (2) holding said pair of tape reels (11) therein and having an opening (6)
for providing access to said recording tape (10);
a main lid (24; 52) pivotably mounted on opposite side faces of said cassette case (2)
for covering at least a front portion of said opening (6) when said main lid (24; 52) is in

a closed position and exposing said at least front portion of said opening (6) when said
main lid (24; 52) is an opened position;
a plate-like top lid (34; 51) pivotably mounted on said main lid (24, 52) so as to be
movable therewith, said top lid (34; 51) being located so as to cover an upper portion

of said opening (6) when said main lid (24; 52) is in said closed position and being at
least partially located on top of an upper surface of said cassette case (2) when said

main lid (24; 52) is in said opened position; and
guide means (9) arranged in said cassette case (2) for guiding the top lid when said
main lid (24; 52) is opened and closed;
said recording tape (10) being accessible when said main lid (24; 52) is in said opened
position and being substantially covered when said main lid (24; 52) is in said closed

position,
characterized in that the guiding means comprises a wedge shaped end face (40) of the top lid for
contacting the cassette case and raising the top lid in an initial path and a horizontal

surface (9a) of the guide means (9) parallel to the upper surface of said cassette case (2) for controlling guiding

of a rear-end portion of said top lid (34; 51) parallel and in a distance to said upper
surface of said cassette case (2) in a final path so as to prevent an inner surface of said

top lid (34; 52) from sliding along said upper surface of said cassette case (2).
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 1, wherein said top lid (34; 51) includes means
(44) for contacting said guide means (9), and wherein said top lid (34) is moved in a

substantially rearward direction when said main lid (24; 52) is opened and is moved
in a substantially forward direction when said main lid (24; 52) is closed while the

contacting means (44) contact said guide means (9).
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 2, wherein said cassette case (2) includes an
upper shell (17) and a lower shell (4) and wherein said guide means (9) includes a

guide groove (53) having an inclined portion extending from a front lower end
portion of said cassette case (2) toward an upper rear portion thereof and a flat

portion contiguous to said inclined portion.
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 3, wherein a rear end portion of said top lid
(51) is held at a height which is between a first height (F) from a bottom face of 

said lower shell (4) to said main lid and a second height (E) from said bottom face
of said lower shell (4) to an upper portion (17) of said upper shell (3) when said main

lid (52) is in said opened position.
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 4, further comprising a back lid (57) coupled
to a rear portion of said top lid (51) and adapted for pivotal motion therewith, said

back lid (57) being arranged such that said recording tape (10) is held between said
back lid (57) and said main lid (52).
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 5, further comprising a second guide groove
(58) located on a side face of said cassette case (2) and wherein said back lid (57)

has a back lid guide (62) which is guided by said second guide groove (58) so as to
move said back lid (57) to an upper portior of said upper shell (17).
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 6, wherein movements of said top lid (51)
and said back lid (57) are controlled so as to move upwardly after a relatively small

time period has passed since said main lid (52) began to open.
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 6, wherein said back lid (57) is arranged
between said top lid (51) and said upper portion of said upper shell (17) when said

main lid (52) is in said opened position.
A tape cassette (1) according to claim 8, wherein said back lid (57) is arranged so as
to be substantially parallel to said main lid (52) and said top lid (51) which are

substantially arranged in a row when said main lid (52) is in said opened position.
