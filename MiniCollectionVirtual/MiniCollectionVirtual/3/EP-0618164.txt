<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for holding down and loading sheets of new paper or other sheet-like materials, especially folded sheets, which are preferably moved within a multi-purpose folding machine, with at least one loading roller which is under the effect of a spring force. In order to guarantee exactly parallel sheet guidance and a fault-free processing even of multiple copies, it is proposed, according to the invention, to design the loading roller or loading rollers as a ballbearing which is in direct non-positive contact with the sheet.
