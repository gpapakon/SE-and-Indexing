<ABSTRACT>
The precursor is of the type including a chlorine-containing organotin derivative and an organotin fluoroalkanoate. It is characterised in that it consists:   - of 60 to 90% by weight of at least one chlorine-containing organotin derivative, - of 5 to 30% by weight of at least one organotin mono(fluoroalkanoate), and   - of 0 to 15% by weight of a tetraorganotin compound.   When deposited in vapour phase, it gives a coating which has a low surface resistance and a high light-transmission coefficient. The deposition requires little time, with the result that the precursor is well suited for forming a coating on a moving substrate, for example on float glass.
