<ABSTRACT>
A device for detecting motion of a vehicle uses 
a fuel tank level sensor (111) that provides a 

signal (112) indicative of a level of fuel (105) 
in a fuel tank (103). A filter (117), preferably 

in a highpass configuration, receives the signal 
(112) and provides a filtered signal (123) 

indicative of changes in the level of fuel in the 
fuel tank (103) greater than a predetermined rate 

of change. Preferably, a comparator (127) 
provides an indication of motion of the fuel in 

the fuel tank (103) when the filtered signal (123) 
exceeds a predetermined threshold (125). In an 

alternative embodiment, the signal (112) from the 
fuel tank level sensor (111) is monitored by an 

alarm module (201). The alarm module (201) uses 
the detected motion in tandem with various other 

vehicular inputs (129,203) to determine either an 
absolute level or a stability of the fuel level, 

resulting in sounding of an alarm (137). A method 
for the detection of motion is also 

detailed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is generally directed to the 
field of motion detectors, and specifically for 
the detection of motion in a vehicular fuel tank. 
In particular, it is useful for providing a 
detection of motion in a vehicular alarm system. Contemporary vehicles often employ motion 
detectors to enhance the performance of certain 
systems of the vehicle. These systems may include 
vehicular alarm systems. These vehicular alarm 
systems may use a motion detector to warn the 
alarm system that the vehicle is being jacked-up 
to remove a tire, or that the vehicle is being 
lifted to be towed. Given this information from 
the motion detector the alarm system may activate 
the alarm to warn the vehicle operator or others 
of the action. In present vehicular alarm systems, this motion 
detector is typically based on a mercury switch. 
These mercury switches are difficult to package, 
require extra labor and cost to install and add to 
system complexity thus unreliability. What is needed is an improved motion detector 
for application in a vehicle that is less costly, 
easy to install, and more reliable than present 
motion detectors.  FIG. 1 is a system block diagram of a motion 
detector applied in an alarm system in accordance 
with a preferred embodiment; FIG. 2 is a system block diagram of a motion 
detector applied in an alarm system in accordance 
with an alternative embodiment; and FIG. 3 is a flow chart illustrating method 
steps associated with the alternative embodiment 
shown in FIG. 2; and FIG. 4 is another flow chart illustrating 
alternative method steps associated with the 
alternative embodiment shown in FIG. 2. In a preferred embodiment, a device for 
detecting motion of a vehicle uses a fuel tank 
level sensor that provides a signal indicative of 
a level of fuel in a fuel tank. A filter, 
preferably in a highpass configuration, receives 
the signal provided by the fuel tank level sensor, 
and provides a filtered signal indicative of 
changes in the level of fuel in the fuel tank 
greater than a predetermined rate of change. 
Preferably, a comparator provides an indication of 
motion of the fuel in the fuel tank when the 
filtered signal exceeds a predetermined threshold. In an alternative embodiment, the signal from 
the fuel tank level sensor is monitored by an 
alarm module. The alarm module uses the detected 
motion in tandem with various other vehicular  
 
inputs to determine a condition resulting in 
sounding of an alarm. A method for the detection 
of motion is also detailed. An
