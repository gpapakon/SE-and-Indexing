<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a thermal transfer printing 
method. In particular, this invention relates to a method of 
printing by using a recording means such as a thermal head 
together with an ink material containing coloring material made 
of dyestuff. A well-known thermal transfer printing method in recent 
years is to record through sublimation and diffusion of dyestuffs 
i.e. coloring materials. According to this method, a recording 
can be obtained by using an ink sheet comprising a heat-resisting 
substrate such as polyethelene terephthalate (PET), condenser 
paper or the like which is disposed on the surface with an ink 
material layer made of dyestuffs and a binder material with a 
thickness of about 1 µm to transfer the dyestuffs directly on a 
recording medium having a color developing property by a 
recording head. In the following, the above-mentioned conventional 
thermal transfer printing method is explained with reference to 
the structure and the operation. First, an ink sheet comprising a heat-resisting substrate 
and an ink material layer made of dyestuffs and a binder material 
is placed between a thermal head and a platen and press-welded  
 
together with a color receiving sheet such as a recording paper. 
Next, a signal coming from a recording signal source heats the 
thermal head and raises a temperature of the ink material 
selectively. When the ink sheet is separated from the color 
receiving sheet, a part of the dye contained in the ink material 
layer is transferred onto the color receiving sheet. A 
transferred image is obtained in this way. However, the above-mentioned conventional structure has 
the problem that a transferred amount of the dye differs greatly 
according to the surface material of the color receiving sheet. 
In other words, since the dye is transferred onto the color 
receiving sheet by raising the temperature of the ink material 
layer and causing sublimation and diffusion of the coloring 
material made of dyestuffs, the recording is only possible when 
the surface material of the color receiving sheet has a color 
developing property. Furthermore, the transferred amount of the 
dye is dependent upon the color developing property of the 
surface material of the color receiving sheet. For example, when 
ordinary paper is used as the color receiving sheet, the recorded 
image can be scarcely obtained by the transfer of the dyestuffs, 
since there is hardly any color developing property on the 
surface. Furthermore, the above-mentioned conventional structure
