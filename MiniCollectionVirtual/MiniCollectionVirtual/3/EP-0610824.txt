<ABSTRACT>
Security door lock on a domestic clothes dryer has a door spigot, with a spring action lock. The lock striking plate carries a spring action sliding element, and a dual position security device to prevent use, or to lock the door when the machine is running. The clothes dryer (10) has a large aperture (5) and a suitable door (6) with handle (8). It is reversible n the bolts (4) for hinge (9) or door lock (1). The power is switched on only when the projection (7), or (7,1) when the door is reversed, is completely pressed into the slot above the aperture.

A safety door closure for household appliances with a 
detent element arranged on the door (6) and with a sprung 

counter-detent element (22) arranged on the household 
appliance in the region of the door opening, in which the 

detent element and the counter-detent clement (22) assume in 
the closed position of the door (6) a detent position which 

is able to be released again with a given force, in 
particular for washing driers,
 
characterised in that 


the counter-detent element, which is constructed as a slider 
(22), and a spring element (26) are accommodated in a stop 

strip (20), 
in the stop strip (20) an additional security element (25) 
is mounted which is adjustable in at least two positions, 
in one position of the security element (25) the slider (22) 
projects int
o an opening (21) for the detent element which 
is constructed as a detent hook (3), and is held in a sprung 

operating position to close the door (6), and in the other 
position of the security element (25) the slider (22) and/or 

the spring element (26) are adjusted so that the sprung 
operating position of the slider (22) is counteracted and 

hence maintenance of the closed position of the door (6) is 
prevented. 
A safety door closure according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that the slider (22) facing away from the 

opening (21) is supported by means of the spring element 
(26) against a control shoulder (28) of the security element 

(25) and is held against a stop of the stop strip (20) in 
the sprung operating position, and
 
the control shoulder (28) has a cam defining the positions 

of the security element (25), which cam has in the positions 
a different distance from the rotational axis of the 

rotatably mounted security element (35) (Fig. 3 to 6). 
A safety door closure according to Claim 1 or 2,
  
 

characterised in that
 
the spring element (26) is constructed as spring tongues 

formed in one piece on the slider (22), which lie against 
the cam of the control shoulder (28) of the security element 

(25). 
A safety door closure according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that 


the slider (22), facing away from the opening (21), is 
supported by means of the spring element (26) against a step 

or stop (30) of the stop strip (20), 
the slider (22) is extended by a frame-like shoulder (27) 
beyond the opening (2) and lies with this against a control 

shoulder (28) of the security element (25) which is 
rotatably mounted in the stop strip (20) and 
the control shoulder (28) has a cam defining the positions 
of the security element (25), which cam has in the positions 

a different distance from the rotational axis of the 
security element (25) (Fig. 7 and 8). 
A safety door closure according to Claim 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the spring element (26) is constructed as a helical spring 

which is guided on a pin-shaped shoulder of the slider (22) 
and lies against the slider (22) and against the step or 

shoulder (30) of the stop strip (20). 
A safety door closure according to Claim 4 or 5,
 
characterised in that 


the opening (21) in the stop strip (20) is rectangular and 
is aligned with its longitudinal dimension in the 

longitudinal direction of the stop strip (20), 
the opening of the frame-like shoulder (27) of the slider 
(22) is likewise rectangular and has a longitudinal 

dimension which is greater than the longitudinal dimension 
of the opening (21), and 
the dimension of the opening of the frame-like shoulder (27)  
 

of the slider (22) perpendicularly to the longitudinal 
direction of the stop strip (20) is equal to or less than 

the associated dimension of the opening (21) but greater 
than the thickness of the detent hook (3). 
A safety door closure according to one of Claims 1 to 
6,
 
characterised in that
 
the security element (25) on the end face facing the front 

side of the stop strip (20) has a shoulder, reduced in 
diameter, with a round cross-section, which is inserted from 

the rear into a bore of the stop strip (20) and is mounted 
so as to be rotatable therein. 
A safety door closure according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that
 
the detent hook (3) is constructed symmetrically and has on 

both narrow sides an engagement bevel and a disengagement ` 
bevel. 
A safety door closure according to one of Claims 1 to 
8,
 
characterised in that 


the stop strip (30) is provided with two fastening mounts 
(4), the spacing of which corresponds to the spacing of the 

fastening mounts of a door hinge by which the door (6) is 
articulated on the household appliance, and 
the stop strip (20) is able to be arranged on the household 
appliance in two positions, rotated through 180Â°. 
A safety door closure according to one of Claims 1 to 
9,
 
characterised in that
 
the door (6) is provided with a door contact via which the 

household appliance is put in readiness for operation and is 
capable of being initiated by means of a switching means 

such as a switch, button or the like.
