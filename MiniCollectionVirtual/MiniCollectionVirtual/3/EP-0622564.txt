<ABSTRACT>
A quieted motorized servoactuator with a sub-fractional horsepower high 
rpm, low voltage motor (30) driving a gear train with about 900:1 reduction 

overall. The motor shaft has a metal worm (32) meshing with a first stage 
gear (34) of elastomeric material, preferably polyamide polyester, of a hardness 

not greater than 72 on the Shore "D" scale. The first stage gear has an 
integral pinion (38) meshed with a second stage gear (40) of harder 

thermoplastic material, preferably acetal. The second stage gear has an 
integral pinion (42) meshed with an output sector gear (46) formed of harder 

thermoplastic material preferably comprising polyamide filled one-third by 
volume with fine glass particles.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to motorized servoactuators of the type
employing a small, high rpm, low torque electric motor driving a train of gears
to provide a low rpm, high torque output for connection to a mechanism for
performing a mechanical function. Servoactuators of this type are commonly
employed in automotive vehicles for controlling air valves or blend-air doors in
automotive air conditioning systems; and may also be used in other
applications such as heater coil water valves and valves used for control of
engine coolant circulation during engine warm-up.Heretofore, where it is desired to employ a small, high rpm, low torque
motor operating on a low voltage supply such as a direct current supply
operating at 12 - 14 volts, as typically employed in a passenger motor vehicle,
problems have been encountered with noise in the gear train, due to the high
rpm of the motor shaft input gear. In particular, the relatively high frequency
vibration of the input stage gear causes resonance in the gear casing or
housing of the servoactuator which has been transmitted to the surrounding
vehicle structure, producing a noticeable and objectionable sound which is
audible in the passenger compartment.It has thus been desired to provide a motorized servoactuator capable of
operating on a relatively low voltage direct current supply, and which provides
a low rpm, relatively high torque output and which is quiet in the sense of
being free from any audibly objectionable whine or gear noise which would be
noticeably objectionable to a passenger in a vehicle. The abstract to JP-A-2030866 relates to a door locker. In this
context the miniaturization of a motor is suggest by a method
in which the tooth of a worm gear fixed to the output shaft of
an electric motor is profile shifted sideways and a wheel gear
to be engaged with the worm gear and to turn an operating lever
is provided. The constitution thereof is as follows: The tooth
of a phosphorus bronze worm gear fixed to the output shaft of
an electric motor is profile shifted sideways to reduce the
width of tooth and also to increase backlash. When the motor is
operated, a resinous wheel gear is turned through the first
mentioned gear and an operating lever is turned with a pin by
the end of the projection of the second mentioned gear. A
locking arm connected to the lever is also moved to a locking
position or an unlocking position.JP-A-58-54254 discloses a reduction gear mechanism comprising
only plural spur gears. Housing means are provided having a motor
