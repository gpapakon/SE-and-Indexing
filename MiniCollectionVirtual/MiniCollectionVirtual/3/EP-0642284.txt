<ABSTRACT>
A method of operating a small telephone system which provides 
telecommunications services for personal wireless telephone sets over an 

area which is divided into service cells is disclosed. Each of the cells is 
defined by reception characteristics of a plurality of radio base stations 

within the cell. During a call progress, if the wireless telephone set is 
mobile, a radio link with the set is handed off from one cell to another as 

the wireless telephone set moves along. The telephone system includes a 
service controller and a port being wireline connected between each radio 

base station and the service controller. The service controller selects 
radio base stations for setting up radio links with wireless sets of a calling 

or called persons, and responds to received signal strengths for handing a 
radio link from a radio base station to radio base station, to maintain the 

quality of the radio link with an active mobile wireless telephone set,

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to low power wireless communication 
systems, but more particularly to a telephone system for providing low 
power mobile telephone service. Wireless telephones, such as cellular phones, have become 
popular beyond expectation. Cellular phones are supported by cellular 
telephone systems which typically include a mobile telephone central 
switching exchange being connected to a multitude of geographically 
distributed cellular radio stations via a corresponding multitude of multi-channel 
trunks. In populous areas, cellular systems are rapidly becoming 
overloaded with the result that mobile telephone services are sometimes 
degraded or simply unavailable. As an alternative to the cellular systems, 
a new standard referred to as CT2 has been recommended. This standard 
defines low power radio links, in a different portion of the radio frequency 
spectrum with respect to that of the cellular spectrum, and being functional 
over much shorter distances, for example distances of up to about 200 
metres. It has been realized that the typical cellular system structure and 
radio link control methods are inefficient and unsuitable for direct 
application in a telephone switch incorporating the CT2 standard. It is an object of the invention to provide a low power wireless 
telephony service, being supported by a small telephone system. Small telephone systems are of two different basic architectures, 
namely that of a key telephone system, and that of a telephone branch 
exchange. In these systems, individual associated telephone sets have 
traditionally been wire linked to the system.  The branch exchange includes a call controller which is 
commonly accessible to all the telephones connected to the branch 
exchange. Telephone operations and telephony features are centrally 
provided. Beyond some minimum size, the branch exchange is more 
economical than the key telephone system. A wireless system supported 
by a branch exchange is disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,771,448. Key telephone systems are characterised in that there is little or 
no apparatus which is commonly accessible to the telephones connected to 
the system. The primary advantage of key telephone systems is one of 
economy with small size. Examples of small telephone systems, are disclosed in each of 
United States Patent Nos. 4,873,682, 4,893,310 and 5,136,585 issued in the 
names of George Irwin et al, David Robertson et al, and Nadir 
Nizamuddin et al respectively, each being titled "Digital Key Telephone 
System

<CLAIMS>
In a small telephone system having a plurality of cells for 
wireless communication with portable sets each having a preassigned 

identity, wherein each cell includes a plurality of radio base stations, any 
one of which is operable to provide a radio link with a portable set over 

any one of a plurality of radio frequency channels, and wherein a portable 
set is operable to initiate the radio link by identifying at least one vacant 

radio frequency channel and then periodically broadcasting, in the 
identified radio frequency channel, a radio signal including a coded 

message corresponding to a preassigned identity of the portable set, a 
method for completing the radio link comprising the steps of: 


a) in one of the radio base stations detecting a receive signal 
strength indication (RSSI) level of the broadcast radio signal; 
b) registering the received RSSI level at said radio base station; 
c) in response to the RSSI level being greater than a portable 
originating link setup (POLS) threshold level, broadcasting, from said radio 

base station, an acknowledgement radio signal being indicative of the 
channel and the RSSI level of the radio link with said portable set, to a first 

cell manager associated with the radio base station; 
d) completing a telephone wireless connection between the 
radio base station and the portable set if, the RSSI level of the radio link 

therebetween is at least a value of an arbitration threshold; 
e) instructing cell managers associated with base stations in 
neighboring cells to send registered RSSI levels, associated with the 

channel used by the portable set, to the first cell manager, if the RSSI 
level is of a lesser value than the arbitration threshold and if the registered 

RSSI levels of neighboring cell managers is greater than the POLS 
threshold level; 
f) receiving, at the first cell managers, the registered RSSI 
levels of cell managers associated with neighboring cells to compare with 

the RSSI level of the radio link; and 
g) enabling completion of a radio link at a cell manager having 
the greatest RSSI level.
