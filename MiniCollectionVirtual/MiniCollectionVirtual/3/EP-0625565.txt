<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electro 
rheological fluid, and to a homogeneous electro rheological 
fluid in particular, wherein the viscosity of the fluid can 
be controlled by applying an electric field. An electro rheological fluid is generally referred 
to as an electric insulating fluid in which inorganic or 
high-molecular particles have been dispersed in a state of 
suspension. The viscosity of the fluid varies rapidly and 
reversibly from a liquid to a plastic solid state when an 
electric field is applied to the fluid. The phenomenon is 
referred to as the Wien's law effect. Generally, the surface of the foregoing dispersed 
particles is affected and polarized with ease by the action 
of an electric field. Examples of the inorganic dispersion 
particles include silica, (U.S. Patent No. 3,047,507, BP No. 
1,076,754 and JP Laid-Open Publication No. 61-44998) and 
zeolite (JP Laid-Open Publication No. 62-95397). Examples of 
the high-molecular dispersion particles include an alginic 
acid (JP Laid-Open Publication No. 51-33783), a glucose  
 
having carboxyl or sulfonic acid group, and a divinylbenzene-crosslinked 
polyacrylic acid (JP Laid-Open Publication No. 
53-93186), a resol-type phenolic resin (JP Laid-Open 
Publication No. 58-179259). Examples of the electric insulating liquid include 
a hydrocarbon oil, a silicone oil, an ester-type oil, and a 
fluorine-type oil, and the like. Although it is envisaged 
that the prime application of electro rheological fluids will 
be in the production of engine mounts, shock absorbers, 
clutches, and the like, they have not been put to practical 
use. Precipitation of the dispersed particles from the 
heterogeneous phase of electro rheological fluids is the main 
factor in the difficulty. Attempts to develop homogeneous 
electro rheological fluids have been made, for example, by 
using a low-molecular liquid crystal such as 
methoxybenzylidene butylaniline [Japanese Journal of Applied 
Physics 17, page 1525(1978)]; however, the resulting fluids 
have a very poor electro rheological effect, and have not 
been commercially acceptable. In addition to the foregoing, 
Japanese Patent Publication No. 42-11315 discloses a 
homogeneous solution of a high-molecular liquid crystal which 
can exert an electro rheological effect. Further, it has been disclosed that a solution of a 
poly(γ-benzyl-L-glutamate) in a low-boiling polar solvent or  
 
a low-boiling chlorine-type solvent can exert a marked 
electro rheological effect wherein dioxane, tetrahydrofuran,
