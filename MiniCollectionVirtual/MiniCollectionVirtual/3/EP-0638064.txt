<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to substituted 1,1,2- triphenylbutenes 
which are structurally related to tamoxifen, a drug used in the 
treatment of oestrogen-dependent cancer, especially breast 
cancer, and their use for the same purpose. Researchers into anti-cancer drugs continually seek to 
improve on existing drugs, in particular to increase their 
efficacy. Many variations of the structure of tamoxifen have 
already been proposed. One such proposal is contained in our US 
Patent 4 839 155. (The European counterpart is EP-B 260 066). 
This patent claims 3- and 4- iodotamoxifen derivatives of formula 
(1): 
 
wherein I represents a 3- or 4- iodo substituent and R1 and R2, 
which may be the same or different, represent C1-3 alkyl groups 
or R1 represents a hydrogen atom and R2 a C1-3 alkyl group and R1 
and R2 together with the nitrogen atom to which they are  
 
attached represent a saturated heterocyclic group, in the form of 
the free bases or their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition 
salts. Preferably R1 and R2 represent methyl groups or R1 and R2 
together with the said nitrogen atom, represent a pyrrolidino 
group. The most preferred such compounds have the iodine atom in 
the 4-position of the phenyl group and are termed "4-iodo 
tamoxifen" and "Idoxifene" respectively. It has now been found that extending the ethylene (-CH2-CH2-) 
part of the side-chain of such compounds confers on 
representative compounds benefits over tamoxifen, and even over 
4-iodotamoxifen or Idoxifene, from which it can reasonably be 
concluded that they will be particularly valuable for treatment 
of oestrogen-dependent cancer, especially breast cancer. Accordingly, the present invention provides compounds of the 
general formula (2) 
 
wherein n is an integer of from 3 to 10, I represents a 3- or 4-iodo 
substituent and R1 and R2, which may be the same or 
different, represent C1-3 alkyl groups or R1 represents a 
hydrogen atom and R2 a C1-3 alkyl group or R1 and R2 together 
with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached represent a 
saturated heterocyclic group and their pharmaceutically 
acceptable acid addition salts.  
 The invention also includes compounds of formula (2) for use 
in the treatment of said cancers, most particularly in humans. Compounds of formula (2) in which the iodine atom is 
radioisotopic are included in the invention, as well as their use 
in treating the said cancers by radiotherapy or in diagnosing 
them, according to the isotope employed. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical
