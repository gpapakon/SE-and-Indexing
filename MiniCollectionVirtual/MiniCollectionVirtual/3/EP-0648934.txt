<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a full-circumferential
flow pump, and more particularly to a full-circumferential
flow pump which has an impeller mounted on an
end of the shaft of a motor and an annular space defined
around the motor.One known pump in which the fluid being handled
flows circumferentially around the motor is disclosed in
German laid-open patent publication No. 1653692 (DE 1653692).
The disclosed pump allows the shaft to be rotated manually
and the pump assembly to be serviced without the piping's
being detached.FIG. 17 of the accompanying drawings shows such a
known pump. As shown in FIG. 17, the pump has a block-shaped
housing 100 which houses a motor comprising a stator 101 and
a rotor 102 that is positioned within the stator 101 with a
small gap defined therebetween. Impellers 103, 104 are
mounted on the respective ends of the shaft of the rotor 102.
The fluid which is being handled flows in from an inlet port
105 and is divided into two fluid flows which are pressurized
by the respective impellers 103, 104 which are being rotated.
The fluid forced out of the impellers 103, 104 merges and is
then discharged from an outlet port 106.In the known pump, however, the stator 101 is
subject to pressure irregularities and tends to suffer 
various mechanical failures. Specifically, there are
developed three regions on the outer circumferential surface
of the motor. These three regions include:
(1) a region where the fluid flows under the inlet
suction pressure;(2) a region where the fluid flows under the outlet
discharge pressure; and(3) a region where the fluid does not flow.
Accordingly, pressures or external forces which are not
uniform are applied to the stator 101, possibly causing the
stator 101 to be strained or deformed.The motor is highly likely to undergo mechanical
distortions particularly if an outer motor frame casing is
made of thin sheet metal or the pressure for discharging the
fluid is high. Furthermore, since the outer motor frame
casing and an outer pump casing are integrally formed with
each other in the disclosed pump, the motor may possibly
malfunction when subjected to external forces due to a piping
load or the like.It is therefore an object of the present invention
to provide a full-circumferential flow pump which can
uniformize external forces or pressures applied to an outer
motor frame casing surrounding a motor stator to thereby
prevent the motor frame from being strained or deformed, and
can be serviced internally without detachment of the piping.According to an
