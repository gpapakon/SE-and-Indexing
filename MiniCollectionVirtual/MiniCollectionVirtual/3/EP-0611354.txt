<ABSTRACT>
A pallet (10) of corrugated fiberboard material has floor-contacting spaced, parallel and longitudinal extending base members (11) perpendicularly interconnected at longitudinally spaced intervals by spaced, parallel and laterally extending deck members (12). Each member is constructed from creased and scored rectangular blanks (21) folded to comprise a solid core of adjacent vertically oriented panels (22) surrounded by an outer covering of perimetric horizontally and vertically running panels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a pallet of corrugated material for the
shipment and storage of a load of goods stacked thereon according
to the preamble of claim 1.Pallets are widely used in the transportation and
storage of goods. The goods (typically packaged in boxes
or bags) are stacked on the pallet and bound thereto by
straps or wrapping for shipment therewith as an integral
unit. Loaded pallets are stored in warehouses either on
the floor or in racks in adjacent single or multiple level
layers.Conventional pallets are usually made of wood.
Wooden pallets offer good materials handling and stacking
strength characteristics. The decreasing supply of
readily available wood is raising the cost of such
pallets, however, and such wooden pallets are heavy and
bulky to transport.The use of pallets made of corrugated paperboard and
similar materials as a substitute for wooden pallets has
gained limited acceptance for some applications. Such
corrugated pallets are lightweight, relatively maintenance
free and readily disposable or recyclable. They may be
transported and stored in unassembled form for maximum
space utilization when unloaded, and assembled on-site for
loading. After usage, they can be broken down for
disposal or recycling just like cardboard boxes and other
corrugated products. One kind of known corrugated pallet is illustrated by
the structures shown in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,446,914;
2,728,545; 3,464,371; and 3,477,395. Such pallets
comprise a plurality of longitudinally extending elongated
base members or stringers held in parallel, spaced
relation by means of top and bottom rectangular decking
sheets to form skids with open channels into which the
tines of forklifts can be inserted for materials handling
purposes. Other versions of such pallets, as shown in
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,131,656 and 3,683,822, add a degree of
lateral stability by providing a plurality of laterally
extending, parallel; spaced deck members or cross runners
perpendicularly interconnecting the base members at
axially spaced intervals to form a rectangular lattice
structure. The deck members span the base members in
elevated positions without floor contact between the base
members leaving the fork channels unobstructed.Though known corrugated pallets provide lightweight,
inexpensive alternatives to conventional wooden pallets
for some applications, their strength and rigidity under
both static and dynamic loading is insufficient to permit
widespread general usage for all types and distributions
of goods. Base member constructions,

<CLAIMS>
A pallet of corrugated material for the shipment and
storage of a load of goods stacked thereon, and the

like, comprising:

a plurality of spaced, parallel and longitudinally
extending base members (111);
a plurality of spaced, parallel and laterally extending
deck members (112);
each base member (111) being a rectangular cross-sectioned
member having a planar top surface and

comprising a first unitary blank (26) of corrugated
material, divided by first crease and score lines

(27, 28) into first adjacent rectangular panels
(29), and folded along said first crease and score

lines (27, 28) to present a first closely packed
core of adjacent vertically stacked ones of said

first panels (29), wrapped by a first outer covering
of perimetrically placed, alternating vertically

and horizontally disposed ones of said first
panels (29), said vertically stacked and vertically

disposed first panels (29) having their respective
corrugations oriented vertically;
each deck member (112) having a planar top surface
and comprising a second unitary blank (126) of

corrugated material, divided by second crease and
score lines into second adjacent rectangular panels,

and folded along said second crease and score
lines to present a second closely packed core of

adjacent stacked ones of said second panels, wrapped
by a second outer covering of perimetrically

placed, alternating vertically and horizontally
disposed ones of said second panels, said horizontally

disposed second panels having their respective
corrugations oriented vertically; 
each base member (111) being further provided with
a plurality of longitudinally-spaced, parallel and

laterally extending first U-shaped notches (116)
which open upwardly onto said each base member top

surface;
each deck member (112) having opposing vertical
sides and being further provided with a plurality

of laterally-spaced, parallel and vertically extending
second U-shaped notches (117, 118);
said deck members (112) being respectively inserted
at said notches (117, 118) into corresponding ones

of said first notches (116) to establish the longitudinal
spacing of said deck members (112); and
said first notches (116) being vertically dimensioned
so that said deck members (112) inserted into

said first notches (116) present said deck member
top surfaces in a common plane with said base member

top surfaces;

characterized in that
each deck member (112) has a rectangular cross-section;
the stacked second panels are horizontally stacked
and have their respective corrugations oriented

vertically;
the second U-shaped notches (117, 118) are arranged
as opposing pairs, one notch (117) of each pair

opening to one vertical side and the other notch
(118) of each pair opening to the other vertical

side, said deck members (112) being respectively
inserted at said pairs of second notches (117, 118)

into corresponding ones of said first notches
(116); 
said first notches (116) being longitudinally dimensioned
less than spacings between said second

notches (117, 118) by an amount sufficient to apply
an interference force fit for interconnecting said

base members (111) by said deck members (112) to
establish the lateral spacing of said base members

(111) and
said first notches (116) being vertically dimensioned
relatively the same as corresponding vertical

dimensions, between said ones of said pairs of

second notches (117, 118), of said deck members
(112).
The pallet according to claim 1, characterized in
that at least one of said plurality of base members

(111) is provided with a series of cutouts (135) to
form laterally aligned tine receiving openings.
The pallet according to claim 2, characterized in
that base member has a first and second portion, said

laterally aligned tine receiving openings being
formed in said first portions and defining lifting

surfaces against which the tines inserted in said
channels can act to lift said pallet, and said second

portions being located adjacent to said first portions
and defining backup surfaces of uncut corrugated

material in alignment with said laterally aligned
tine receiving openings against which said tines can

also act when they act against the cutout lifting
surfaces during lifting of said pallet. 
The pallet according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that the deck members are square

cross-sectioned runners, and the bottom surfaces of
said deck members and said base members do not lie in

a common lower horizontal plane.
The pallet according to one of the preceding claims,
characterized in that a top sheet (14) is attached on

the top surfaces of the base and deck members (111,
112).
