<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid catalyst
component comprising an electron-donor selected from a
particular class of diketones, and to a catalyst for the
polymerization of CH2=CHR olefins, wherein R is hydrogen or a
C1-C6 alkyl radical or an aryl radical, comprising the product
of the reaction between said solid catalyst component, an Al-alkyl
compound and, optionally, an electron-donor compound.Further, the invention relates to said specific class of diketones itself.Catalysts comprising titanium compounds supported on
magnesium halides in active form are well known in the art.Catalysts of this type are described, for example, in US
patent 4,298,718. Said catalysts, although very active in the
polymerization both of ethylene and of α-olefins, such as
propylene, are not sufficiently stereospecific.Stereospecificity has been improved by adding an electron-donor
compound to the solid component comprising the titanium
compound (US patent 4,544,717).Further improvements have been obtained by using both an
electron-donor compound added to the solid catalyst component
(internal donor) and one added to the Al-alkyl compound
(external donor; US patent 4,107,414).Extremely high performances, both in terms of activity and
stereospecificity, are given by the catalysts described in
European Patent 0045977. Said catalysts comprise as a solid
catalyst component a magnesium halide in active form on which
is supported a titanium halide (TiCl4) and an electron-donor 
compound selected from specific classes of carboxylic acid
esters, such as the phthalates, for example. The co-catalyst
used is an Al-alkyl compound to which is added a silicon
compound containing at least one Si-OR bond (R = hydrocarbon
radical).US patent 4,522,930 describes catalysts whose solid
catalyst component is characterized in that it contains an
electron-donor compound which is extractable with Al-triethyl
(under standard extraction conditions) for at least 70% in
moles, and after the extraction it has a surface area of at
least 20 m2/g.Said catalysts comprise, as a co-catalyst, an Al-trialkyl
compound to which is added an electron-donor compound (external
donor) having the property of not causing complexing reactions
with the Al-triethyl detectable by potentiometric titration
under specific reaction conditions. The above mentioned
electron-donors comprise silicon compounds having Si-OR bonds;
2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, 2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine,
Al-diethyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide, Al-dichloromonophenoxy,
and other
