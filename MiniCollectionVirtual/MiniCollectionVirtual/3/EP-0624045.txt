<ABSTRACT>
An acoustic waveguide loudspeaker system has an 
electroacoustical transducer (21) having a vibratile 

surface (21). An acoustic waveguide (22) has a first end 
(23) open and a second end (21A) adjacent to the vibratile 

surface (21) and an effective length corresponding 
substantially to a quarter wavelength at the lowest 

frequency of pressure wave energy to be transmitted between 
the first and second ends (23,21A). Damping material (24) 

in the waveguide (22) near the vibratile surface (21) is 
positioned so as to negligibly attenuate bass frequency 

energy while of sufficient volume to damp peaks at higher 
frequencies above the range of the bass frequency energy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to an
acoustic waveguide loudspeaker system generally of the type
disclosed in Bose U.S. Patent No. 4,628,528 and more
particularly concerns an acoustic waveguide loudspeaker
system having damping and starts from EP-A-0 101 031.EP-A-0 101 031 discloses a speaker with open-ended
acoustic waveguide. US-A-3867996 discloses a speaker with
highly damped housing.According to the invention, there is provided an
acoustic waveguide loudspeaker system comprising:
an electroacoustical transducer having a vibratile
surface,an acoustic waveguide having a first end open and a
second end adjacent to said vibratile surface, and
characterised by:the acoustic waveguide having an effective length
corresponding substantially to a quarter wavelength at the
lowest frequency of pressure wave energy to be transmitted
between said first and second ends, anddamping material in said waveguide near said vibratile
surface positioned so as to negligibly attenuate bass
frequency energy while of sufficient volume to damp peaks
at higher frequencies above the range of said bass
frequency energy.  Other features, objects and advantages will become
apparent from the following detailed description when read
in connection with the accompanying drawings in which:
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of a
loudspeaker driver at one end of a hollow hard tube
acoustic waveguide with damping material near the driver; Fig. 2 is a perspective view with top removed of an
exemplary embodiment of the invention;Fig. 3 is a graphical representation of pressure
response as a function of frequency of the embodiment of
Fig. 2; and Fig. 4 is a diagrammatic plan view illustrating the
structure of an exemplary embodiment of the invention in a
stereo receiver cabinet.With reference now to the drawing and more
particularly Fig. 1 thereof, there is shown a diagrammatic
representation of a loudspeaker driver 11 at one end of a
hard tube 12 which may have substantially 55-60% the cross-sectional
area of driver 11 and functioning as an acoustic
waveguide of length 1 having an open end 13 that radiates
waves launched at the other end by driver 11 with damping
material 14 near driver 11. Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown a perspective
view of an embodiment of the invention suitable for
formation in a table receiver. Driver 21 is seated in
opening 21A of acoustic waveguide 22 having open end 23.
Polyester damping material 24 fills the section of
waveguide 22 adjacent to the driver compartment portion 21B
of waveguide
