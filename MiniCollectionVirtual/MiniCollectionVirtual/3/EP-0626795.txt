<ABSTRACT>
Changing ω₀ in a transfer function is much easier than 
recombining transfer functions of a built-in filter. Noticing 

this point, the circuit uses a method of shifting the 
frequency characteristic of a bell filer or antibell filter 

instead of changing a bell and antibell and uses means for 
changing central frequencies while keeping the amplitude 

characteristic constant. Therefore, input sides of filters 
can be changed so that a signal processing system can also 

shift frequencies. Moreover, by separately preparing a 
reference signal, adjustment is omitted by making the 

reference signal pass through the bell and antibell filters at 
the same time and monitoring and adjusting filter 

characteristics one by one.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates an SECAM chroma processing
circuit for automatically adjusting SECAM-type chroma signal
processing and preferably used mainly for a video tape
recorder (VTR).In the SECAM system, an R-Y signal (red color-difference
signal) frequency-modulated at the carrier frequency of
4.40625 MHz and a B-Y signal (blue color-difference signal)
frequency-modulated at the carrier frequency of 4.25 MHz are
alternately transmitted every horizontal period. The
amplitude of these frequency-modulated signals is suppressed
in the vicinity of the carrier frequencies of the signals at the
transmission side in order to decrease dot disturbances by
suppressing a carrier wave amplitude nearby the achromatic
wavelength. This suppression filter is called an antibell
filter because its characteristic has an antibell shape. The
central frequency of the antibell filter during transmission
is 4.286 MHz. The frequency of 4.286 MHz is hereafter shown
as 4.3 MHz. For a television picture tube, a signal is
processed after passing it through a filter in which the
signal amplitude increases in the vicinity of the carrier 
frequency to offset the group delay characteristic and
amplitude characteristic at the transmission side, inversely
to the antibell filter of the transmission side.In the chroma recording/reproducing system of a VTR, the
SECAM system includes L-SECAM system and ME-SECAM system. Of
these two systems, the L-SECAM system uses a method of
dividing the chroma signal component of a color television
signal into four parts to convert the frequency into a low
frequency and record the frequency and multiplying the
frequency for reproduction by four to convert the
frequency into the original high sub-carrier-wave frequency.FIG. 16 shows the processing system of an existing VTR
recording/reproducing system of the L-SECAM system.For recording, switches SW9 and SW10 are connected to the
R side. A color television signal inputted to an REC chroma
input terminal IN is supplied to 4.3 MHz BPF 81 through the
switch SW9. The BPF 81 extracts only an SECAM chroma signal
from the color television signal. The chroma signal is
inputted to a 4.3 MHz bell/antibell filter 82. The 4.3 MHz
bell/antibell filter 82 serves as a bell filter for recording.
A limiter circuit 83 amplifies the output of the 4.3 MHz
bell/antibell filter 82. A four-to-one frequency 84 decreases the
frequency of the output signal of the limiter circuit 83 to
1/4. The SECAM chroma signal whose frequency is thus
decreased to 1.1 MHz is inputted to the
