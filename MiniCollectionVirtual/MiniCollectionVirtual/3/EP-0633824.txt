Holding device for the holding, guiding and automatic 
release of a fastener part, such as for example a nut or 

another element, in an apparatus for the attachment of 
the fastener part to a plate-like component or in another 

apparatus for the positionally accurate conveyance 
of the element, comprising a guide piece (32) having a 

channel (36) to which the element (60) can be supplied 
through a lateral supply opening (56), a plunger (20), 

which is longitudinally displaceable in the channel (36) 
through a relative movement between the guide piece and 

the plunger in order to displace the element (60) in a 
push-out movement from a starting position adjacent to 

the supply opening (56) to a working position at one end 
of the channel (36), and at least two holding claws (82) 

which are pivotally journalled by pivot pins (86), 
which, in an inwardly pivoted closed position, hold the 

element (60) in contact with the plunger (20) and can 
be automatically outwardly pivoted into an open position 

releasing the element (60), characterised in that the 
holding claws (82) are pivotally mounted on the plunger 

(20) so that they move with the plunger (20); and in 
that a compulsory guide (90) is provided for the holding 

claws (82), which holds the holding claws in their 
closed position during a push-out movement of the 

plunger (20) and first releases them for outward pivoting 
into the open position when the plunger (20) 

reaches the working position at the end of the channel 
(36).  

 
Holding device in accordance with claim 1, characterised 
in that the compulsory guide (90) has guide surfaces 

(92, 94) provided at the holding claws (82) and at the 
guide piece (32), which, during a relative movement between 

the guide piece (32) and the plunger (20) 
slidingly contact one another and thereby prevent an 

outward pivoting of the holding claws (82). 
Holding device in accordance with claim 2, characterised 
in that a set-back step (96, 98) serving as a relief 

follows the guide surfaces (92, 94) in each case and enable 
an outward pivotal movement of the holding claws 

(82) when the plunger (20) reaches the working position 
during its push-out movement. 
Holding device in accordance with claim 3, characterised 
in that the set-back portions (96, 98) are provided with 

oblique surfaces (96a, 96b) which pivot the holding 
claws (82) back into their closed position during a retraction 

movement of the plunger (20). 
Holding device in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the bearing pins (86) for 

the holding claws (82) are arranged in elongate slots 
(88) of the plunger (20) in order to enable a restricted 

longitudinal displacement of the holding claws 
(82) relative to the plunger (20); and in that an inclined 

surface connection (100) is provided between the 
holding claws (82) and the plunger (20) which pivots the 

holding claws (82) outwardly into their open position 
during such a longitudinal displacement. 
Holding device in accordance with claim 5, characterised 
in that the holding claws (82) project in the longitudinal 

direction beyond the plunger (20) so that they are  
 

stopped during a push-out movement of the plunger (20) 
by striking a stationary counter-surface (62, 64) and 

thereby execute the longitudinal displacement relative 
to the plunger (20) necessary for the outward pivoting 

movement. 
Holding device in accordance with claim 5 or claim 6, 
characterised in that the inclined surface connection 

(100) consists of inclined surfaces (104) provided on 
the holding noses (102) of the holding claws (82), with 

the inclined surfaces contacting the element (60) in the 
closed position of the holding claws (82). 
Holding device in accordance with one of the claims 5 to 
7, characterised in that the holding claws (82) are each 

provided with a cam-projection (106) which, during a retraction 
movement of the plunger (20), cooperates with 

a cam-surface of the guide piece (32) in order to reset 
the holding claws (82) in the longitudinal direction 

relative to the plunger (20). 
Holding device in accordance with one of the claims 5 to 
7, characterised in that the holding claws (82') are so 

biased by springs (91) in the longitudinal direction 
that during a retraction movement of the plunger (20) 

they are reset relative to the latter by the spring 
force (10). 
Holding device in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the holding claws (82) are 

arranged in longitudinal grooves (84) of the plunger 
(20).  

 
Holding device in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the bearing pins (84) of 

the holding claws (82) are secured against sliding out 
by contact at the wall surfaces of the channel (36). 
Holding device in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the plunger is formed as 

the plunger (20) of a punch device, which is secured to 
a housing (4) of an upper part (2) of a press which is 

vertically moveable relative to a die (62) which receives 
the plate-like component (64). 
Holding device in accordance with claim 12, characterised 
in that the channel (36), which receives the 

plunger (20) is centrally arranged in the guide piece 
(32), and in that the guide piece (32) is displaceably 

mounted in a centrally arranged guide opening (34) of 
the housing (4). 
Holding device in accordance with claim 13, characterised 
in that the guide piece (32) is biased in the direction 

away from the upper part (2) of the press by
