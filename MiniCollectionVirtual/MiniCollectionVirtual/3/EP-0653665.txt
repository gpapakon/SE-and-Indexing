<ABSTRACT>
An optical switch has relatively low power requirements and a relatively 
broad operating bandwidth. This switch includes a Mach-Zehnder interferometer 

(MZI) (30) optically coupled at respective ends to an input coupler (10) and an 
output coupler (40). One arm (90) of the MZI includes a thermo-optic phase shifter 

(110). 
The output coupler (40) is an adiabatic 3-dB coupler. In one embodiment, the 

input coupler (10) is a Y-branch coupler having one input port (20). In a second 
embodiment, the input coupler is an adiabatic 3-dB coupler having two input ports.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the switching of optical signals between 
alternate waveguiding media such as optical fibers. More particularly, the invention 
relates to optical switches in which resistive heating causes a refractive index change 
in a portion of the switch, leading to a change in the distribution of transmitted light 
at the output end of the switch. Switches are needed in optical communication networks, for, e.g., 
routing signals and adding and substituting signal-carrying lines. Integrated optical 
switches are advantageous for these purposes because they can be made more 
compact than mechanical switches, and can be embedded in integrated networks of 
optical interconnections. One integrated optical switch of current interest is based on a Mach-Zehnder 
interferometer (MZI) that includes a thermo-optic phase shifter in one arm. 
Light enters the MZI through one branch of an input directional coupler, and exits 
the MZI through one of alternate branches of an output directional coupler. When a 
heating current is applied to the phase shifter, the output signal shifts from one to the 
other of the alternate branches. This switch has excellent transmission 
characteristics only when the power coupling ratios of the directional couplers are 
close to 3 dB. When these ratios deviate substantially from 3 dB, the output 
channels suffer crosstalk and excess loss. The power coupling ratio is close to 3 dB 
only within a relatively narrow band of wavelengths. As a consequence, effective 
operation of the switch is limited to a relatively narrow spectral range. For example, 
a typical switch designed to operate at 1.4 µm will have cross talk, in its powered 
state, of less than -15 dB over a range of about 1.36 µm - 1.45 µm. Significantly, 
such a range is too small to include both the 1.3-µm and 1.55-µm communication 
channels. Some practitioners have modified the MZI switch to extend its useful 
spectral range. For example, T. Kitoh et al., "Novel Broad-Band Optical Switch 
Using Silica-Based Planar Lightwave Circuit," IEEEPhoton.Technol.Lett.4 (1992) 
735 - 737, reports a switch in which the directional couplers are replaced by 3-dB 
wavelength-insensitive couplers (WINCs). Each WINC includes an MZI having a 
subsidiary thermo-optic phase shifter in one arm. This switch has a predicted  
 
crosstalk of less than -20 dB over a spectral range of 1.27 - 1.62 µm. However, this 
switch requires relatively high electric power to operate the three thermo-optic phase 
shifters. Thus, practitioners in
