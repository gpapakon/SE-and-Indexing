<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to the use of a fastening element for the releaseable connection of a polygonal tube, preferably of a box-shaped tube (7), to a basic body (1) which can be inserted into the end of the polygonal tube and on which there are arranged expansion elements (2) which, by actuation from the outside, by way of axial displacement relative to the basic body (1), can be expanded against inner surfaces (11) of the polygonal tube, in order to connect the basic body and the polygonal tube to one another in a frictionally locking manner. In order, when using said fastening element, to avoid buckling of the inner pipe walls as a result of high retaining forces, it is proposed that the number of the expansion elements (2) be equal to the number of the inner edges of the polygonal tube, and the expansion elements (2) be arranged on the basic body (1) such that, in the expanded state, they bear in the respective inner edges of the polygonal tube.

Device for the releasable connection of
polygonal tubes, comprising at least one polygonal

tube, preferably a quadrilateral tube, and a fastening
element with a basic body which can be introduced into

the end of the polygonal tube and on which there are
arranged spreader elements which, by actuation from the

outside, can be spread against inner surfaces of the
polygonal tube by way of axial displacement relative to

the basic body, in order to connect the basic body and
polygonal tube to one another in a frictionally locking

manner, characterized in that the number of spreader
elements (2) is equal to the number of inner edges (11)

of the polygonal tube (7), and the spreader elements
(2) are arranged on the basic body (1) such that, in

the spread-out state, they butt exclusively against the
respective inner edges (11) of the polygonal tube (7),

and in that the spreader elements (2) are designed in a
resilient manner and are inclined at an acute angle (w
1
)
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the polygonal

tube (7).
Fastening element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the spreader elements (2) are

designed in a resilient manner such that they increase
their acute angle of inclination (w
1
) in order to
produce the spreading movement.
Fastening element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the basic body (1) has supporting

surfaces (12) which are inclined at an acute angle (w
2
) 
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the polygonal

tube (7) and along which the spreader elements (2)
slide as they are spread out and as the spread-out

state is cancelled.
Fastening element according to Claim 3,
characterized in that, in the non-spread out state, the

acute angle of inclination (w
1
) of the spreader elements
(2) is smaller than the acute angle of inclination (w
2
)
of the supporting surfaces (12), with the result that

the spreader elements (2) butt against the supporting
surfaces (12) exclusively in the region of the

spreading tips (6) formed at their outer edges.
Fastening element according to one of Claims 1
to 4, characterized in that all the spreader elements

(2) form a constituent part of a single-piece,
resilient spreader body (5) which has a central region

(9) on which an actuating means (3, 3a, 3b) acts and
from which the individual spreader elements (2) extend

radially outwards via obtuse-angled transitions.
Fastening element according to Claim 5,
characterized in that the spreader body (5) is designed

as a punched metal component, and the individual
spreader elements (2) are formed by obtuse-angled bent

sections of said punched component.
Fastening element according to one of Claims 1
to 6, characterized in that the spreader elements (2)

have a section (14) which is constant in terms of width
and which is adjoined by spreading tips (6) which taper

in the form of a V.
Fastening element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the spreader elements (2) are

actuated via an actuating means (3, 3a, 3b) arranged
centrally in the basic body.
Fastening element according to Claim 1,
characterized in that, in addition to the basic body

(1), the fastening element has other, essentially
identical basic bodies (1), these being arranged on a

preferably cube-shaped central body (16) for the 
purpose of fastening further polygonal tubes

orthogonally with respect to one another.
Fastening element according to Claim 9,
characterized in that the central body (16) is provided

with a common actuating member (17, 18) by which the
actuating means (3b) of a plurality of basic bodies (1)

can be actuated simultaneously.
