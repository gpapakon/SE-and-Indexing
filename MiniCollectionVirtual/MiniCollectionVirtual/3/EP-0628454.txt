<CLAIMS>
A belt retractor (10) for vehicular seat belt systems 
having a rotational belt tensioner drive (12) engaging the 

belt reel (16), characterized by a speed-up planetary 
gearing (26, 28, 30) being inserted in the force flow 

between the belt tensioner drive (12) and the belt reel 
(16), said speed-up gearing comprising a planetary gear 

carrier (323). 
A belt retractor as set forth in claim 1, characterized 
by the planetary gearing comprising an internally toothed 

ring gear (30), planetary gears (28), the planetary gear 
carrier (323) and a sun gear (26), said planetary gears (28) 

engaging the internal toothing of said ring gear (30) and 
the outer toothing of said sun gear (26). 
A belt retractor as set forth in claim 2, characterized 
in that said belt tensioner drive (12) has a drive part 

drivingly coupled to said ring gear (30), in that said sun 
gear (26) of said planetary gearing can be drivingly coupled 

to said belt reel (16) and in that said planetary gear 
carrier (323) is fixed with the retractor housing. 
A belt retractor as set forth in claim 3, characterized 
by said drive part being formed by a rotary piston (301) of 

a rotary-piston rotational drive with a gas generator (36).  
 
A belt retractor as set forth in claim 4, characterized 
by an extension of a rotary piston (301) being formed on the 

outer circumference of said ring gear (30), said extension 
forming together with said ring gear (30) a single-vane 

rotary piston orbiting in a ring-shaped space (321, 322) 
surrounding said ring gear (30). 
A belt retractor as set forth in claims 4 and 5, 
characterized by a pyrotechnical gas generator (36). 
A belt retractor as set forth in claims 4 to 6, 
characterized by a clamping roller coupling (24, 40, 241) 

being inserted between said belt reel (16) and said sun gear 
(26). 
A belt retractor as set forth in any preceding claims, 
characterized by said planetary gearing being provided with 

three planetary gears (28). 
A belt retractor as set forth in claims 2 to 8, 
characterized by said planetary gears (28) being inserted in 

recesses in said planetary gear carrier (323).
