<ABSTRACT>
A scene change detector operates on an 
image signal which has been converted to a spatial-frequency 

distribution by an orthogonal transformation 
circuit such as a discrete cosine transformation circuit 

(18). A DC coefficient extracting section (27) extracts 
the DC component of the spatial-frequency distribution for 

each of a plurality of blocks in the image. These 
values are stored for successive frames in two stores 

(29,30) and the differences between them calculated by a 
circuit (31). The absolute values of the differences 

are taken (32) and a discriminating circuit (33) 
determines whether the differences exceed a threshold. 

A scene change is indicated if the threshold is exceeded 
for more than a predetermined number of blocks in the 

frame.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image editing apparatus,
and more particularly to a method of automatically
detecting a change or shift between different scenes of
an image, and and an image editing apparatus which makes use
of the method.When an editing operation is performed for image
information such as a video image, the editing operation
is performed in most cases for each scene or shot of the
video information. Also, when engaged in connecting a
plurality of scenes to make up a single work, connection
of the scenes is carried out after first deleting unnecessary
portions, editing the image, processing the image,
adding special effects and performing other necessary
operations for each of the scenes.In a movie or cinema, editing operations such as
those mentioned above have been performed by coloring a
film frame by frame or patching, that is, cutting and
connecting, a film after photographing. Where image
information is stored on a video tape, a video disk, a
hard disk or a similar recording medium, the physical 
recording medium itself is not made a subject for editing,
but rather, editing operations are performed for an
image signal read out from the recording medium. As the
image signal, a signal that has been processed by image
compression processing is frequently used.In order to perform an editing operation for an
image signal, since an editing operation is performed in
most cases for each scene, it is necessary to detect and
record information regarding a starting time and an
ending time of each scene in advance. Conventionally, an
image is displayed using a frame feeding function of an
image reproducing apparatus, and starting and ending
times of each scene are manually written down one by one
making use of time information incidental to input source
data. This method, however, requires considerable labor
and time for detection of a change or shift between
scenes, resulting in a reduction of operation efficiency
in editing operations.An image editing apparatus is disclosed in Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Application No. 268370/1990 (JP, A, 2-268370)
by Katayama et al. wherein, using image data
coded so as to allow progressive display as subject data,
original image data are automatically edited in accordance
with an editing procedure in which editing has been
performed for low resolution data of the image data.
With the apparatus, since a retrieving or editing operation 
by a human operator is performed for low resolution
data, the time required for retrieval or transmission can
be reduced.

<CLAIMS>
A method of detecting a scene change of an
input image composed of a plurality of frames, comprising

the steps of:

detecting a direct current component value of a
spatial frequency distribution by orthogonal

transformation for each of a plurality of blocks into
which each of the frames is divided;
calculating an absolute value of a difference
between the direct current component value of a current

frame and the direct current component value of a frame
adjacent to the current frame for each of the blocks of

the current frame; and
counting the number of blocks for which the absolute
value exceeds a first threshold value and discriminating,

when the number of the blocks is higher than a second
threshold value, that there is a scene change between the

current frame and the adjacent frame.
The method for detecting a scene change as
claimed in claim 1, wherein the plurality of frames are

inputted in a time series.
The method for detecting a scene change as
claimed in claim 2, wherein the adjacent frame is a frame

that precedes or succeeds the current frame.
The method for detecting a scene change as
claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the orthogonal

transformation is discrete cosine transformation. 
The method for detecting a scene change as
claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, wherein each of the

blocks is a rectangular region in the frame.
The method for detecting a scene change as
claimed in any of claim 1 to 5, wherein time information

or image position information of the input image when the
scene change is detected is stored.
Image editing apparatus for editing an input
image composed of a plurality of frames, comprising:


orthogonal transformation means (18) for applying an
orthogonal transformation to each of a plurality of blocks

into which each of the frames is divided;

direct current component values to said first storage

means or said second storage means for each of the frames;

said first and second storage means to calculate the

absolute values of the differences between the direct
current component values of corresponding blocks of the

first and second frames; and 
discriminating means (33) for discriminating the
presence or absence of a scene change in the input image

based on the said absolute values by counting the number
of blocks for which the absolute value exceeds a first

threshold value and, when the number is higher than a
second threshold value, by determining that there is a

scene change between the first frame and the second frame.
