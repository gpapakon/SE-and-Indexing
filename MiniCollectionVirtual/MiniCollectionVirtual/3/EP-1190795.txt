<ABSTRACT>
An indexable insert (10) is located on a toolholder (40) with reference to bearing surfaces (80,82) on
the insert and the toolholder which are proximate to the active cutting edge. These bearing

surfaces (80,82) are internal to the peripheral (side) flanks (18) of the insert. Location of the insert in the
toolholder is substantially independent of the relation between the toolholder pocket

sidewalls and the peripheral flanks (18) of the insert, thereby eliminating sources of error from
insert manufacture and pocket manufacture. The insert (10) and toolholder (40) have locating units (30,32)

disposed thereon adapted to matingly engage each other when the insert (10) is placed in the
toolholder (40). At least one of the locator elements (30,32)

has a bearing surface (80,82) or surfaces that
extends through 360Â° and resulting in less movement of the insert (10) during use.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to cutting tools that effect location of the insert at a selected position on the toolholder with improved accuracy and reliability. More particularly, the invention provides inserts and toolholders wherein the inserts are located in the toolholder using reference surface or surfaces close to the active cutting edge and substantially independent of contact between the flanks of the insert and the toolholder.In the cutting tool industry, it is a conventional practice to use cutting toolholders, e.g. mills, drills, lathes, reamers, bores, cutters, blades and other known cutting devices, having replaceable cutting inserts of hard wear resistant material releasably secured thereto. The toolholders are manufactured with recesses or pockets therein, to hold and support the cutting insert, either alone or coupled with an insert-holding cartridge. Generally, the insert has multiple cutting edges or cutting edge portions and only one or two of them are put in contact with the workpiece at any one time. The cutting edge or edges positioned in the toolholder to contact the workpiece are referred to as active cutting edges. In this manner, when the active cutting edges of the insert become dull or the insert otherwise fails, the less expensive insert is indexed to an unused cutting edge which becomes "active" or replaced rather than replacing or repairing an entire tool.The use of inserts has provided cost savings in materials and labor, as well as allowing use of materials for the cutting insert that are different from the toolholder material. However, the use of replaceable inserts has also created challenges in positioning the insert uniformly, accurately and repeatably in the toolholder in a selected orientation, that is, to locate the insert. Another challenge presented by insert use is to limit movement of the insert relative to the toolholder during use. Location is critical to overall tool performance including the tolerances that can be maintained, reliability of the tool, down time and tool life.Historically, cutting edges integral with a cutting tool, such as the teeth on a hand saw, had a fixed position relative to the tool body and movement of the cutting edge was limited by characteristics of the tool material. The use of inserts as individual parts of a cutting tool, separate from the toolholder, introduced new variables that contribute to inaccuracy in positioning of the active cutting edge. Variables that affect position of the active cutting edge in the toolholder include,

<CLAIMS>
A cutting tool comprising:

(a) a toolholder (40) having an insert receiving region (44) comprising an insert receiving seat (16) and bores (50) penetrating the insert receiving seat (46) and extending into the toolholder (40);
(b) a cutting insert (10) securable within the region (44) having a body (12) defined by a top surface (14) a bottom surface (16) and at least one flank (18) extending therebetween, and at least one cutting edge (11, 13, 24, 26) formed by intersection of one of the flanks and one of the surfaces (14, 16),
(c) a first locating unit disposed on the insert body (12), the first locating unit comprising first (30) and second (32) stationary locator elements disposed on at least one of the surfaces (14, 16) the first stationary locator element (30) positioned proximate a cutting edge (24, 26) to be located,
(d) a second locating unit disposed in the insert receiving region (44) the second locating unit comprising first (64) and second (66) toolholder locator elements positioned within the bores (50) at least one of the toolholder locator elements (64, 66) being adapted to extend outward from the insert receiving seat (46) to matingly engage at least one of the stationary locator elements (30, 32),
(e) the locator elements (30, 32) comprising bearing surfaces (36),
(f) a tensioning device (68) for urging bearing surface (80) on one of the toolholder locator elements (64), into abutment with the bearing surface (36) of the first stationary locator element (32).
The cutting tool of claim 1, wherein the first (30) and second (32) stationary locator elements comprises bores for matingly engaging pins (64, 66) on a toolholder (40) and bearing surface circumscribing the bore for frictionally limiting rotational and translational movement of the insert.
