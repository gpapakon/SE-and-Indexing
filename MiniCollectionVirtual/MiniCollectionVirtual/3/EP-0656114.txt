<ABSTRACT>
Methods and compositions useful in the detection of human cancer cells and malignant tumors are provided. Certain human autocrine motility factor receptors or proteins (gp78-hAMFR) have been identified which are useful in the detection of human cancer cells and malignant tumors. Methods and assay kits for the detection of human cancer, human cancer cells, and tumors, are provided wherein antibodies or other probes are used which recognize gp78-hAMFR expression. These methods and assays readily distinguish between non-malignant and malignant cancer cells and tumors and can be used to gauge metastatic potential.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method of Determining Metastatic Potential of Tumor CellsA portion of the work described herein was supported by NIH Grant CA-51714-01A2.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to methods and compositions useful in the analysis of human cancer cells and malignant tumors. More specifically, the present invention provides techniques for determining the presence and level of expression of autocrine motility factor receptors on human cells. In one aspect, the level of expression of human autocrine motility factor receptors in cancerous bladder tissue cells is determined to predict metastatic potential. In this manner, the invention provides a means by which treatment may be more accurately administered. This invention also relates to assay kits for cancer analysis. The method and assays of the present invention readily distinguish between non-malignant and malignant cancer cells and tumors and can be used to gauge metastatic potential.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONA considerable amount of research effort has been directed towards the development of techniques to detect cancer cells or to distinguish between non-malignant and malignant cancer cells or tumors. For those patients with cancerous cells or tumors, it is important to determine which patients have the greatest risk for tumor progression or metastasis. For these patients, aggressive therapy, including surgery and chemotherapy, may be selectively employed. For patients demonstrating a lower risk of progression and metastasis, less aggressive therapy may be employed, particulary since progression or metastasis can now be readily monitored as provided in the present invention. Thus,SUBSTITUTE SHEET 

one of the major problems of cancer treatment and research is the development of reliable and predictive methods of cancer detection.Recently, various methods for analyzing tumor specimens or exfoliated cells have been developed to detect genetic alterations, tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, tumor cell products, and angiogenic factors. It is known that cancer progression in stage or grade is associated with increasing chromosomal anomalies that can be assessed by measuring tumor cell DNA content, by cytogenetic studies, or by measuring the function of activation in oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes.Masters et al., "DNA Ploidy and the Prognosis of Stage pTl Bladder Cancer," Br. J. Urolo. 64, 403 (1985), has used DNA measurements which show a correlation to tumor grade and recurrence rates. Norming et al.,

 CLAIMS
What is claimed is:
1. A purified and isolated human autocrine motility factor receptor having the amino acid sequence set forth in Figure 1.
2. A polynucleotide having the sequence set forth in Figure 1.
3. A polypeptide having the amino acid sequence of amino acids 1 to 111 in Figure 1.
4. An antibody prepared using the amino acid sequence of amino acids 1 to 111 in Figure 1.
5. A cDNA or RNA for use in detecting the presence of DNA or RNA having the base sequence substantially as set forth in Figure 1.
6. A method of detecting malignant human cells, said method comprising: exposing a sample of human cells to a probe for a gp78-hAMFR protein, wherein the probe has a detectable label; removing unbound probe from the sample; and detecting the level of probe bound to the sample to determine the level of gp78-hAMFR protein expression of the sample; wherein increased gp78-hAMFR protein expression correlates with malignant human cells.
7. A method as defined in claim 6, wherein increased gp78-hAMFR correlates with presence of malignant human cells and with the stage of development of malignant human cells.
SUBSTITUTE SHEET 


 8. A method as defined in claim 6, wherein the gp78-hAMFR protein has the amino acid sequence substantially as set forth in Figure 1.
9. A method as defined in claim 6, wherein the gp78-hAMFR protein has the amino acid sequence substantially as set forth between amino acid residues 1 and 111 in Figure 1.
10. A method as defined in claim 8, wherein the detectable label is fluorescent.
11. A method as defined in claim 9, wherein the detectable label is fluorescent.
12. A method as defined in claim 6, wherein the human cells are human bladder cells.
13. A method as defined in claim 10, wherein the human cells are human bladder cells.
14. A method as defined in claim 11, wherein the human cells are human bladder cells.
15. A method of evaluating the probability of metastasis of a cell sample from a mammalian host, comprising the steps of: contacting the cell sample to be tested for metastatic potential with a probe wherein the probe is an antibody which selectively binds gp78-hAMFR; removing excess probe from the cell sample; and detecting the level of the probe bound to the cells to determine the level of expression of gp78-hAMFR by the cell sample.
16. A method as defined in claim 15, wherein the mammalian host is a homo sapiens.
