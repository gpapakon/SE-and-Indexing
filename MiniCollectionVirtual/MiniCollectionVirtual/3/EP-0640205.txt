<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention is that of telescoped round-type ammunition cases. The case according to the invention consists of a cylindrical plastic envelope (2) carrying at each end a plastic cap (3a, 3b) fitted with a metal reinforcing means. The invention is characterized in that the reinforcing means integral with the front cap (3a) is a collar (5) which includes a peripheral cylindrical portion (6) and an outer edge (7) and entirely covers the front end (8) of the cap (3a) extending from the envelope. Application in weapons.

<CLAIMS>
Casing for a telescoped-type munition (1) composed 
of a cylindrical envelope (2) made of plastic material and 

having a plug (3a,3b) at each end in plastic material 
fitted with metal reinforcing means (5,15) comprising a 

peripheral cylindrical part (6,17) and an external edge 
(7) or a base (16), reinforcing means which entirely 

covers one end (8,18) of the plug (3a,3b) projecting from 
the envelope (2), a casing 
characterised in that
 it 
comprises at least one ring-shaped hollow (20a,20b), 

provided on the plug (3a,3b) near to one end (21a,21b) of 
the envelope (2) coming into contact with the reinforcing 

means (5,15), a hollow designed to absorb the deformation 
of the plug during firing and thereby prevent a wad from 

forming. 
Casing according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the ring-shaped hollow is marked out by two ring-shaped 

surfaces roughly flattened and perpendicular to the axis 
of the munition, one being supported by the reinforcing 

means and the other by the plug. 
Casing according to one of claims 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the reinforcing means (5,15) are 

made integral with the plug (3a,3b) by catching a ring-shaped 
rim (11a,11b) provided on the reinforcing means on 

a peripheral groove (12a,12b) of the plug. 
Casing according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the external diametre of the 

reinforcing means is at least equal to that of the nominal 
diametre of the envelope (2) at the maximum operational 

temperature of the casing. 
Casing according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that at least one internal ring-shaped 

cavity (9) is provided between the front plug (3a) and the 
reinforcing ring (5) in such a way as to enable the axial 

and radial deformations of the plug caused by the passage 
of the projectile during firing to be absorbed. 
Casing according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that at least one plug (3a,3b) comprises  

 
a peripheral ring-shaped groove (13a, 13b) designed to be 

placed opposite the envelope (2), and in that the envelope 
is deformed to enable it to be squeezed into the plug 

groove in order to make the plug integral with the 
envelope. 
Casing according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the deformation is performed level with indentation points 

(14) evenly distributed at an angle. 
Telescope-type munition comprising a casing 
according to one of claims 1 to 7 wherein a projectile 

(4), a propelling charge and a primer (19) for the 
propelling charge are placed.
