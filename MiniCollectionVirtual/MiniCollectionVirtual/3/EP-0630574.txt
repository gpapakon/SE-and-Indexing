<ABSTRACT>
A method for producing a molded chocolate product 
having a complicated concaved and convexed decorative pattern 

thereon involves the steps of: (a) charging a low viscosity 
fluidized chocolate material (20) into a complicated concaved 

and convexed decorative pattern portion (15) of an elastic 
mold (10) in bag form for forming the complicated concaved and 

convexed decorative pattern of the chocolate product so that 
air bubbles necessarily incorporated into the low viscosity 

fluidized chocolate material (20) ascend therethrough so as to 
be removed, (b) charging an ordinarily tempered fluidized 

chocolate material (21) into the elastic mold (10) to form a 
main body of the chocolate product, and (c) solidifying the 

low viscosity fluidized chocolate material (20) and the 
ordinarily tempered fluidized chocolate material (21) charged 

into the elastic mold (10) followed by taking the molded 
chocolate product out of the elastic mold (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for producing a 
molded chocolate product, and more particularly to a method 
for producing a molded chocolate product from which air 
bubbles can be removed especially when producing such a 
product having a complicated or intricate concaved and 
convexed decorative pattern at which air bubbles are formed. A variety of methods for removing air bubbles 
incorporated into a chocolate material in the chocolate 
production process have been known. For example, it has been 
well known to vibrate a chocolate mold into which a fluidized 
chocolate material having approximately 60,000 centipoises 
after ordinary tempering is performed is charged. Although in 
the conventional methods it is possible to remove air bubbles 
incorporated into the chocolate material charged into a 
chocolate mold having a simple shape for producing a 
plate-shaped chocolate product, there arises a problem with 
such conventional methods in that it is only insufficiently 
possible to remove air bubbles incorporated into an ordinarily 
tempered chocolate material having a viscosity of 
approximately 60,000 centipoises present in complicated 
concaved and convexed decorative portions formed within a bag 
shaped elastic mold such as finely shaped decorative portions  
 
or inverted tapered decorative portions thereof. The 
chocolate products having decorative patterns on which air 
bubbles are present are commercially less valuable or can not 
be sold depending on the bubbles being formed. Accordingly, 
with the conventional methods decorative patterns of chocolate 
products are necessarily simple and limited in designing. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention 
to provide a method for producing a molded chocolate product 
in which it is possible to readily remove air bubbles 
incorporated into a chocolate material in complicated concaved 
and convexed decorative pattern portions of a chocolate mold, 
the inside of which the complicated patterns such as fine or 
inverted tapered configurations are formed. The above and other objects of the invention will 
become apparent from the following description. According to the invention, there is provided a 
method for producing a molded chocolate product having a 
complicated concaved and convexed decorative pattern thereon 
comprising the steps of: 
(a) charging a low viscosity fluidized chocolate 
material into a complicated concaved and convexed decorative 
pattern portion of an elastic mold in bag form for forming the 
complicated concaved

<CLAIMS>
A method for producing a molded chocolate product 
having a complicated concaved and convexed decorative pattern 

thereon comprising the steps of: 

(a) charging a low viscosity fluidized chocolate 
material (20) into a complicated concaved and convexed 

decorative pattern portion (15) of an elastic mold (10) in bag 
form for forming said complicated concaved and convexed 

decorative pattern of said chocolate product so that air 
bubbles necessarily incorporated into the low viscosity 

fluidized chocolate material (20) ascend therethrough so as to 
be removed, 
(b) charging an ordinarily tempered fluidized 
chocolate material (21) into said elastic mold (10) to form a 

main body of said chocolate product, and 
(c) solidifying said low viscosity fluidized 
chocolate material (20) and said ordinarily tempered fluidized 

chocolate material (21) charged into said elastic mold (10) 
followed by taking the molded chocolate product out of the 

elastic mold (10). 
The method according to claim 1 wherein said elastic 
mold (10) into which said low viscosity fluidized chocolate 

material (20) is charged in said step (a) is vibrated by means 
of vibrating means (30, 31, 32). 
The method according to claim 1 wherein said elastic 
mold (10) into which said ordinarily tempered fluidized 

 
chocolate material (21) is charged in said step (b) is 

vibrated by means of vibrating means (30, 31, 32). 
The method according to claim 1 wherein said low 
viscosity fluidized chocolate material (20) charged in said 

step (a) is a non-tempering chocolate material having a 
viscosity of 5,000 to 10,000 centipoises and wherein said 

ordinarily tempered fluidized chocolate material (21) charged 
in said step (b) has a viscosity of 30,000 to 60,000 

centipoises.
