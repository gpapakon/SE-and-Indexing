<CLAIMS>
Process for the wet-chemical treatment of 
workpieces of semiconductor material by exposing the 

workpieces to a flow of a gasified treatment medium used 

as the liquid, characterized in that a gas and a liquid 
are intensively mixed in a feed pump and the feed pump 

delivers a homogeneous dispersion of very fine gas 
bubbles in the liquid with which the workpieces are 

treated. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that water or an aqueous solution for cleaning or etching 

semiconductor material is used as the liquid. 
Process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that a surfactant is added to the liquid 

to stabilize the gas bubbles. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the gas which is used is inert gas, 

air, oxygen, ozone, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, 
nitrogen monoxide or nitrogen dioxide. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the workpieces are selected from a 

group which comprises semiconductor wafers, crystalline 
ingots of semiconductor material, semiconductor material 

in the form of granules, semiconductor material in the 
form of fragments and shaped bodies of semiconductor 

material.
