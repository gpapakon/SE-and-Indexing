cylinder plate (7) securely mounted on top portions of the 
guide posts (1), and a movable plate (4) slidably mounted on the 

guide posts (1). A cylinder (5) is mounted on the cylinder 
plate.
 A piston rod (9) of the cylinder (5) is connected to the 
movable plate (4). A pick-and-place device (11) is mounted on 

the base plate (2). The pick-and-place device (11) comprises a 
pair of guide rails mounted on the base plate at 

opposite sides of the lower die, opposite sliding 
members slidably mounted on the guide rails, a 

connecting member connecting the sliding members, a 
reciprocating cylinder for reciprocating the connected 

sliding members, and a plurality of gripping actuators 
provided on the opposite sliding members. The gripping 

actuator has opposite gripping cylinders, opposite 
gripping fingers operated by a piston rod of the 

corresponding cylinder for gripping a work. A parts-feeder 
is provided for feeding works one by one to the 

pick-and-place device (11). A sequence controller (12) is 
provided for sequentially operating the machine for 

progressively pressing and assembling works.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a progressive
automatic press and assembly machine.A conventional press machine comprises the features set out
in the preamble of claim 1. Such a press machine is known
from EP 405 894. Here, the cylinder operates so that press
work can be performed on the base plate of a die set. A
sequence controller operates the press machine.Another type of power press machine with progressive dies is
conventionally used to produce a work from hoop material
fed with a roller feeder. In general, the work is
progressively transferred by a robot. Accordingly, the
press machine is comparatively complicated in
construction and costly.An object of the present invention is to provide a
progressive multi-stage press machine using a die set
with an actuator and having a progressive pick-and-place
device, whereby the machine may be simplified in
structure, reduced in size and weight, and manufactured
at a low cost.A multi-stage press and assembly machine according to the present invention
comprises the features set out in claim 1. According to the present invention there is
provided a press and assembly machine with a die set
having a base plate, vertical guide posts securely
mounted on the base plate, a horizontal cylinder plate
securely mounted on top portions of the guide posts, a
movable plate, slidably mounted on said guide posts.The press and assembly machine further comprises a cylinder
vertically mounted on the cylinder plate, the press cylinder
having a piston rod which is connected to the movable plate.
The machine also includes an upper die secured to the movable
plate and a lower die secured to the base plate and a pick-and-place
device mounted on the base plate.The pick-and-place device comprises a pair of horizontally
movable members and gripping deices mounted thereon and means
for vertically moving the members. The pick-and-place device
progressively transfers first works and sends the first work to
the lower die.The machine also includes a parts-feeder means for feeding
second works one by one to the pick-and-place device, and for
engaging the second work with the first work mounted on the
lower die for assembling the first and second works. The
sequence controller operates the press and assembly machine to
perform progressive press and assembly operation of the first
and second works.In a preferred embodiment, the pick-and-place device comprises
a pair of guide rails mounted on the base plate at opposite
sides of the lower die. The movable members are slidably
mounted on the
