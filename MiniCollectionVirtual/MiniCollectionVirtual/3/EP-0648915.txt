<ABSTRACT>
Rock drilling device for drilling with a drill string comprising a set of tubes (1) and a 
set of rods (2) arranged centrally in the set of tubes. The rock drilling device 

comprises means (22) for sensing a liquid pressure in a recoil damper (21) and 
actuating means (23,24) for stopping the supply of pressure liquid to a hammer device 

(25) of the rock drilling device when the pressure in the recoil damper (21) falls 
below a predetermined value in order to prevent that the drilling tool and/or the 

machine housing is damaged at a to low damper pressure

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rock drilling device for drilling in rock by means of 
a drill string comprising a set of tubes, and a set of rods arranged in the set of tubes 
and comprising a number of rods abutting loosely against each other. When drilling with drill strings of the above mentioned kind it is essential that the 
rods forming the set of rods abut against each other when the hammer piston impacts 
the rearmost part of the set of rods so that the energy of the hammer piston is 
transferred to the drill bit at the other end of the drill string without unnecessary 
losses. This problem has been solved by means of the device according to US 
4,993,504. In the thus known device one still has problems when the drill bit 
penetrates into weaker formations. It has turned out that the set of rods in certain 
situations can sink down so that the projections, which are provided in order to 
prevent the rods from falling out from the set of tubes, come in contact with the tubes 
so that these are damaged by the impacts which the rods are exerted to by the 
hammer piston. It has also turned out that the pressure decrease which is obtained in 
the recoil damper can result in damages on the machine housing caused by the recoil 
from the set of rods. The present invention, which is defined in the appended claims, aims at achieving a 
rock drilling device where the above mentioned problem with damages on the set of 
rods and/or machine housing is done away with. An embodiment of the invention is described below with reference to the 
accompanying drawings in which fig 1 schematically shows a section through a rock 
drilling device according to the invention. Fig 2 shows a section through a drill string 
component which is used with the invention. Fig 3 shows a coupling diagram for the 
controlling of the hammer device according to the invention. The rock drilling device shown in fig 1 comprises a machine housing 3 on which a 
front part 11 is mounted. The drilling device comprises a drill string comprising a set 
of tubes 1, which in fig 1 is represented by the drill sleeve 1 which is the rearmost  
 
part, and a set of rods 2, which in fig 1 is represented by an adapter 2 arranged in the 
machine. In the front end of the drill string is a not shown drill bit arranged. The drill 
bit is rotated by means of the set of tubes which is rotated by a rotation motor 12 via 
a gear wheel 13 which gears into teeth 14 on the drill sleeve 1. A hammer piston 4 is 
movable to-and-fro in the machine housing 3 in
