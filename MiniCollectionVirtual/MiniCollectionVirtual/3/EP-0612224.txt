<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a ribbon curling and
shredding device, and particularly to a device suitable for
curling and for shredding polypropylene ribbon at a rapid
rate and for mass production.Hand-held ribbon curling and shredding devices are
known and are used for curling the ends of polypropylene
ribbon ties. Typically such ribbon is used for tying up a
gift parcel and, after making the final knot, the free ends
of the ribbon are curled. Such curling makes an attractive
flower like addition and has the advantage of hiding the
ribbon knot.In use the devices imposes a permanent shear stress on
one side of the ribbon, the amount of stress determining
whether the curls are loose or tight.A disadvantage of prior devices is that if the user is
inexperienced or makes a mistake, the ribbon may be
imprecisely curled or accidentally stressed on both sides.
This often results in having to tie the parcel again in
order to obtain two fresh ends with which to apply the
curling device.Optionally such curling devices may include one or
more shredding blades which slice the ribbon lengthwise.
The shredding blades increase the number of curly ends and
are usually applied to the ribbon after it has been drawn
across a curling edge.To overcome the aforementioned problems the present 
invention provides means for curling and/or shredding
continuous lengths of polypropylene ribbon, the treated
ribbon being pulled tight for trapping and tying parcels and
the free ends automatically adopting a curled form without
any additional operation. Alternatively, plain uncurled
ribbon could be used to tie a parcel, and curled ribbon be
tucked under the knot to provide an attractive feature which
hides the knot; two or more colours may be used.WO-A-91/16178 discloses a dispenser having in
sequence delivery means for delivering a supply of
unstressed curlable ribbon to a curling blade, whereby
curled ribbon is produced as it is drawn from the
delivery means. In the preferred embodiment the
dispenser is a box having an exit slot for the ribbon.US-A-4138048 discloses a tinsel dispensing device
having drive means for drawing tinsel from a reel. According to the invention there is provided a ribbon
curling device comprising in sequence delivery means for
delivering a supply of unstressed curlable ribbon, curling
means for the ribbon, drive means for drawing the ribbon
across said curling means, and stripping means for
separating the ribbon from said drive means. Preferably the
device includes shredding means downstream of said curling
mean
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
