<ABSTRACT>
A syringe device (10) which is not reusable after the first delivery stroke. The syringe has a hollow body (11) slidably containing a plunger (12) in fluid sealing relationship. The plunger (12) has a plunger rod (13) which includes a guide arrangement (17) receiving and guiding a locking member (18). The guide arrangement (17) is adapted to maintain the locking member (18) in an unengaged position relative to the body (11) when the plunger (12) is moved in the direction of a first intake stroke and in a first delivery stroke, and allows relative sliding movement and consequential pivoting movement of the locking member (18) such that, upon commencement of a second intake stroke, the locking member (18) snaggingly engages the inside surface of the body (11) to resist further movement of the plunger (12) in the intake stroke direction. Accordingly, in use, the locking member (18) interacts with the guide arrangement (17) of the plunger (12) and the inside surface of the body (11) so as to allow a first intake stroke and a delivery stroke, but to prevent a second intake stroke of the plunger (12). The syringe device (10) may also allow for aspiration testing, and may have a plunger rod (113) which has two interacting parts (113A, 113B).

<DESCRIPTION>
 NON-REUSABLE SYRINGE Field of InventionThe present invention relates to a non-reusable syringe, and more particularly to an improved syringe construction which prevents re-use and is convenient to manufacture.Description of Prior ArtIt is well known in the art to provide a syringe having a substantially cylindrical hollow body with one end open to receive a plunger and piston arrangement, and the other end adapted to receive a hypodermic needle, cannular or the like. In such syringes, the plunger and piston are normally formed as one piece and act in sealing relationship with the inside surface of the syringe body. When a medicament or the like is to be drawn into a syringe of this known type, the plunger and piston arrangement is withdrawn in an intake stroke, and to expel the medicament the plunger and piston arrangement is moved in a delivery stroke back towards the other end of the syringe body so that the medicament is delivered via the hypodermic needle or cannular into the desired place such as a vein, organ etc.It is nowadays desirable to prevent reuse of a syringe in certain circumstances so as to prevent communicating highly infectious diseases. The heretofore known syringes have the disadvantage that they may be refilled by subsequent withdrawal of the plunger and piston arrangement by the user, or, by pressure within a vial into which the needle of the syringe is inserted. There have been many attempts to provide a syringe which is designed to prevent a second intake stroke and thereby render the syringe useless after the first delivery stroke. Most of the prior art devices have required a sleeve member or the like which cooperates with the plunger at least during a first intake stroke, and 

 which prevents its operation when a second intake stroke is attempted. Although such devices can work effectively, it would be desirable, for example, to eliminate the need for the sleeve member and thereby simplify the locking mechanism. The construction of the device could also be simplified and may reduce the manufacturing cost of the syringe. Further, the syringe should preferably be able to be operated in the same manner as heretofore known syringes, and should allow techniques such as aspiration testing which allows the user to ensure, depending on what is being injected and where, that he has, or has not, found a vein or artery. Summary of the InventionOne broad form of the present invention provides a syringe device comprising: a generally elongate hollow body slidably containing a plunger end

<CLAIMS>
 CLAIMS
1. A syringe device comprising: a generally elongate hollow body slidably containing a plunger end of a plunger in fluid sealing relationship therewith, the hollow body having a first end having a fluid inlet/outlet, and a second end opposite to the first end; the plunger further comprising an elongate plunger rod attached at one end thereof to the plunger end and with the other end thereof projecting out from the second end of the hollow body for slidably moving the plunger end along and within the hollow body; wherein the plunger rod comprises a guide means which extends along the plunger rod, and which receives and is adapted to guide a locking member which has at least one snag projection facing in a direction away from the first end of the body and towards the inside surface of the body; and wherein, in use, the guide means functions to maintain the locking member in an unengaged position wherein the snag projection is spaced from an inside surface of the body when the plunger is moved in a first intake stroke away from the first end of the body, and also in a first delivery stroke towards the first end of the body, and which allows relative sliding movement and causes relative pivoting movement of the locking member with respect to the guide means such that, upon commencement of a second intake stroke, the locking member snaggingly engages the inside surface of the body to resist further movement of the plunger in the intake stroke direction for preventing reuse of the syringe device.
2. The syringe device of claim 1 wherein the locking member is in frictional sliding engagement with the inside surface of the body so as to provide for relative movement of the locking member with respect to the guide means. 


 3. The syringe device of claim 2 wherein the guide means has a first stop means against which the locking member bears during the first intake stroke; a second stop means spaced from said first stop means and against which the locking member bears during the delivery stroke; a slide means extending between the first and second stop means along which the locking member slides during use of the syringe device; wherein the first stop means causes the locking member to be orientated at a first angle with respect to a longitudinal axis of the plunger rod, the second stop means causes the locking member to be orientated at a second angle with respect to the longitudinal axis which is greater than said first angle, and wherein the guide means further comprises an interference portion which causes the locking member to pivot further away from the longitudinal axis and thereby snaggingly engage the inside surface of the body during a second intake stroke, but only when the locking member is oriented at least a predetermined angle with respect to the longitudinal axis which is larger than the first angle at the commencement of the second intake stroke.
4. The syringe device of claim 3 wherein the interference portion is positioned intermediate the first and second stop means and is spaced a predetermined distance from the second stop means so as to allow for aspiration testing of the syringe device.
5. The syringe device of claim 2 wherein the guide means comprises: an elongate slide means extending longitudinally of the plunger rod; a first stop means at one end of the slide means has contoured portion at a predetermined position along the slide means; and 


 a second stop means at the other end of the slide means; the device further comprising a sleeve member which cooperates with the plunger rod, whereby, in use, the sleeve member overhangs and retains the locking member adjacent the first stop means during the first intake stroke, the locking member bears against the first stop means during the delivery stroke whilst the sleeve member is caused to move relative to the plunger rod away from the guide means and release the locking member; and the locking member is caused to slide along the slide means such that a portion thereof rides up an inclined face of the contoured portion whereby the locking member pivots with respect to the longitudinal axis of the plunger rod and brings the snag projection thereof into snagging engagement with the inside surface of the hollow body at the commencement of the second intake stroke.
6. The syringe device of claim 5 wherein the sleeve member is caused to move in unison with the plunger and to retain the locking member during the first intake stroke, and, due to a frictional engagement of the sleeve member with the inside surface of the body, is caused to move with respect to and along the plunger rod away from the plunger end so as to release the locking member when the plunger is moved in the delivery stroke.
7. The syringe device of claim 6 wherein the inclined surface is inclined with respect to a plane of the slide means along which a base portion of the locking member slides during an intake stroke of the plunger, wherein the inclined surface guides the base portion of locking member such that the snag projection is moved into snagging engagement with the inside surface of the body, and wherein the inclined surface has a leading edge in the plane of the slide means which is spaced a predetermined distance from the first stop means which is sufficient to 


 allow for aspiration testing of the syringe device.
8. The syringe deviced of claim 3 wherein the plunger rod is formed by two or more members which cooperate and, in combination, define the guide means for receiving and guiding the locking member.
9. The syringe device of claim 8 wherein the plunger rod is formed by two members which are slidable with respect to one another in the longitudinal direction of the plunger rod between a retracted position wherein the locking member is retained between the first stop means of the first member and a surface of the second member which is generally parallel to the first stop means, and an extended position wherein the surface of the second member is spaced from the guide means; wherein the two plunger rod members are in their retracted position before a first intake stroke, and are moved into their extended position during the first intake stroke; and wherein the plunger rod members have a securing means adapted to secure the two plunger rod members together in their extended position before commencement of the delivery and second intake strokes.
10. The syringe device of claim 9 wherein the interference portion is positioned intermediate the first and second stop means and is spaced a predetermined distance from the second stop means so as to allow for aspiration testing of the syringe device.
11. The syringe device of claim 2 wherein the plunger rod is formed by a first member and a second member which cooperate and, in combination, define the guide means for receiving and guiding the locking member, wherein: the plunger rod members are slidable with respect to one another in the longitudinal direction of the plunger rod between a retracted position and an extended position; the first plunger member has an overhang portion and 


 the second plunger member has a contoured portion, with the first and second plunger members, in combination, forming the slide means; the locking member has a hook portion at one end thereof which is closest to the first end of the body
