<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for processing an
interlace scanned video signal into a non-interlaced compressed
digital signal.The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) are
establishing a standard for transmission and storage of video data
primarily for use by computers. This proposed standard is
detailed in the document "International Organization for
Standardization", ISO-IEC JT(1/SC2/WG1), Coding of Moving
Pictures and Associated Audio, MPEG 90/176 Rev. 2, Dec. 18,
1990. The signal protocol includes the processing of successive
frames of interlace scanned video signal according to a sequence
of inter- and intraframe compression techniques. However only
the odd fields of respective frames are processed and transmitted.
The Advanced Television Research Consortium (ATRC) has
adapted this protocol for the transmission of higher resolution
video images wherein both even and odd frames are processed
and transmitted.According to the compression protocol, the video signal
is processed over respective image areas of, for example, 16-by-16
pixels. Such areas are represented by respective macroblocks
of data. Each macroblock includes six blocks of data. Four of these
blocks correspond to luminance information, with each block
representing an 8-by-8 matrix of pixels. The remaining two
blocks correspond to chrominance information, i.e., one block of U
and one block of V color difference information (U and V may
represent the conventional B-Y and R-Y signals). These blocks
respectively represent the color information over the entire
macroblock, but in subsampled form. That is, the 16-by-16 block
of pixels representing chrominance is interpolated down to an 8-by-8
block of values, and the interpolated values are encoded. Encoding is performed on a frame basis. Successive
pairs of interlace-scanned even and odd fields are first combined
into frames of data, and thereafter the frames of data are
processed as a unit. Refer to FIGURE 1 which illustrates a block of
pixel values. The small squares represent samples corresponding
to respective pixels. The shaded squares represent lines of pixels
from an odd field and the white squares represent lines of pixels
from an even field. The compressed luminance data is derived
from a matrix of image sample values arranged similarly to the
illustrated matrix of squares. The circles represent interpolated
chrominance samples, either U or V. Nominally each chrominance
value is calculated from corresponding neighboring pixel values as
indicated for example, between the upper two
