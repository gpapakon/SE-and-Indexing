<ABSTRACT>
According to the present invention, by setting the logic state of one or more delay 
signals to appropriate values, the resistive value of a plurality of power supply delay 

elements throughout an integrated circuit having distributed circuit blocks may be 
modified to produce desired delay times or pulse width adjustments throughout the 

integrated circuit. Setting delay signals to desired logic states may be accomplished by 
a variety of means including forcing test pads to a logic level, blowing fuses, or entering 

into a test mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit devices, and more
specifically to variable impedance power supply delay elements for use in such
integrated circuit devices.Throughout the design, test, and manufacture of integrated circuit devices, such
as memory devices, there exists the need to determine circuit performance. Especially
during circuit debug, speed optimization, and yield optimization, certain device
parameters and corresponding critical signals must be evaluated. Such critical signals
may include sense amp timing, set-up and hold times, rise and falls times, etc.
Evaluation of critical signals is often accomplished by introducing delays to the critical
signals to change the timing of these critical signals and then measuring how the circuit
responds to such delays. Introduction of delays is often controlled by delay elements. It is often necessary
to distribute delay elements throughout the integrated circuit in order to effect a global
delay for a critical signal, since the critical signal may be distributed across a chip or
within repeated circuit blocks. For example, sense amp timing delays are often times
found in each memory block. It is common for sense amp timing delays to be introduced
to 8, 16, 32, or more circuit blocks.There are several methods currently used in the art to introduce delays in critical
signal timing. Adjustments in the delay of critical signals may be accomplished using
experimental masks, but this is costly and time consuming. It could be done using a
focused ion beam (FIB), but when a number of circuit blocks must be adjusted, this can
be quite time consuming, prone to error, and expensive. FIB is best suited for adjusting
the circuitry at a limited number of locations, rather than repetitive operations. Also, FIB
does not allow for production adjustment by blowing fuses and is therefore not ideal for
a production environment. Additionally, placing fuses in each delay circuit takes a great
deal of layout area and is cumbersome to layout in the central block control area of the
chip.To date, methods for introducing delays to critical integrated circuit signals have
required the placement of delay elements throughout the integrated circuit in distributed
circuit blocks. The distribution of delay elements throughout the integrated circuit means
that adjustments to these delay elements must be made at multiple locations. Methods 
currently used to do this, as described above, may be time consuming, prone to error,
expensive, and not desirable for a
