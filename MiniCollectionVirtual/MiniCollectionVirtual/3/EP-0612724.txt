<ABSTRACT>
There are described benzenesulphonylureas and -thioureas of the formula I 
<
IMAGE
>
 where R(1) is H, (fluoro)methyl, R(2) is H, Hal, (fluoro)(mercapto) alkyl(oxy), E is O, S; Y is -[CR(3)2]n- where R(3) = H or alkyl and n = 1 - 4, X is H, Hal, alkyl, Z is Hal, NO2, alkyl(oxy). The compounds (I) are used for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and for the prevention of sudden heart death due to arrhythmias and can therefore be used as antiarrhythmics. They are particularly suitable for those cases in which arrhythmias are the result of constriction of a coronary vessel, such as in angina pectoris or in acute cardiac infarct.
