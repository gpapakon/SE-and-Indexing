<ABSTRACT>
This unit (device) (1) is intended for equipping an appliance for preparing infusions (infused beverages), comprising a casing (2) enclosing a reservoir of cold water (3), a heating plate (4), intended for supporting an infusion collector (5), a water heater (6) connected thermally to the plate (4) and an electrical resistance element (9) for heating the water heater (6) connected to an electrical supply circuit (10) controlled by the said unit. According to the invention, the device is adapted to supplying the electrical resistance element (9), in a first phase, intermittently by means of current pulses of specific duration which are separated by pauses which are also of specific duration, and, in a second phase, continuously. The invention applies to electric coffee makers or tea makers.

Domestic electrical appliance designed for the preparation 
of infused drinks such as, for example, coffee, tea or a 

similar drink, and comprising a casing (2) enclosing a cold-water 
reservoir (3), a heating plate (4) supporting an 

infusion collector (5), a water heater (6) thermally connected 
to the plate (4) and having a pipe (6') connected to the cold-water 

reservoir (3) and a rising pipe (6'') connected to a 
spout (7) for spraying an infusion filter (8) disposed above 

the infusion collector (5), an electrical heating element (9) 
for the water heater (6) connected to an electrical supply 

circuit (10), and a control device (1) arranged in the 
electrical supply circuit (10) and adapted to supply the 

electrical element (9) continuously in a first phase, 
characterised in that the control device (1) is, moreover, 

adapted so as, in a second phase preceding the first, to 
supply the electrical element (9) intermittently with current 

pulses of a determined duration, separated by periods of 
pause, also of a determined duration. 
Domestic electrical appliance according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the duration of each pulse is small 

compared with the duration of the pause between two successive 
pulses. 
Domestic electrical appliance according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the control device (1) comprises a 

control unit (11) controlling a means (12) for switching the 
supply to the element (9). 
Domestic electrical appliance according to Claim 3, 
characterised in that the control unit (11) comprises a 

microprocessor (11'). 
Domestic electrical appliance according to Claim 3 or 4,  
 

characterised in that the switching means (12) comprises a 
triac. 
Domestic electrical appliance according to Claim 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the switching means (12) comprises a 

relay. 
Domestic electrical appliance according to any one of 
Claims 4 to 6, characterised in that the control device (1) 

additionally comprises a unit (15) for displaying the stages 
in the infusion process, controlled by the microprocessor 

(11'). 
Domestic electrical appliance according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the control device (1) is 

situated inside the casing (2). 
Domestic electrical appliance according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the control device (1) is 

situated outside the casing (2).
