A method of synchronizing a data signal of a controller chip 12 to a 
reference clock signal of a color palette chip 12 in a video driving system 10 

includes the steps of altering the reference clock signal frequency, adjusting the 
phase of an output clock signal from the palette chip 12 wherein the output clock 

signal coupled with delay from controller chip 12 produces a feedback clock 
signal that is synchronized with the altered reference clock signal, and latching 

the data signal with the feedback clock signal thereby synchronizing the data 
signal to the reference clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic circuits and more particularly relates
to synchronization circuits in video palette applications.As video systems continue to increase in operational frequency individual
integrated circuit chips suffer synchronization problems. FIG.1 is a prior art
block diagram illustrating the problem. In FIG.1 a video circuit 10 has a
controller chip 12 connected to a video color palette chip 14. Controller chip 12
sends data to color palette 14 at a first frequency and color palette 14
manipulates the data at a second frequency which is greater than the first
frequency. Typical examples would be a first frequency of 50 Mhz and a second
frequency of 200 Mhz. Due to the high internal operating frequency of color
palette 14, it is very difficult to obtain synchronization between color palette 14
and controller chip 12. Since the period of video palette 14 is 5nS and since the
delay of the clock through controller chip 12 may be 10-20nS (CLKout - CLKin)
it is obvious that synchronization between the two circuits can be a problem.FIG.2 is a prior art solution to obtain synchronization between data of
controller chip 12 and a reference clock signal CLKref of color palette 14. In
FIG.2, signals, varying in delay from one another, each incrementally latch data
into flip flops 16a-16d such that data is synchronized with CLKref of color
palette 14. This solution is limited by the fact that one must assume what delay 
will be needed to appropriately synchronize data to CLKref. Furthermore, the
delay through controller chip 12 is a strong function of temperature, supply
voltage, and process variation, therefore the delay may constantly vary. A second
disadvantage is that multiple flip flops 16a-16d are needed for each data bit.
Therefore, if 64 data bits are incoming, 256 flip flops are needed; if 128 data bits
are incoming, 512 flip flops are needed. Obviously, the large number of flip flops
take a great deal of area in color palette 14 and dissipate power undesirably.It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a method of providing
synchronization between a controller chip and a video palette having variable
delays in clock signals while simultaneously decreasing circuit area and power
dissipation. Other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent
to those of ordinary skill in the art having reference to the following specification
together with the drawings herein.A method of synchronizing a data signal of a controller chip 12 to a
