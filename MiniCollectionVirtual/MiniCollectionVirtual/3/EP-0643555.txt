<DESCRIPTION>
 A method of producing herbicidal granular productsThe present invention relates to a method of producing herbi¬ cidal granular products which contain carbamoyloxyphenyl- carbamates and/or substituted benzofuranes, known per se, as active ingredients, surfactants, suspending agents, inert car riers, and possibly other auxiliary agents, such as stabi¬ lizers, defoamers, coloring agents, and preservatives. The sa active ingredients are insoluble in water and in the main foliage-acting, and they are thus sprayed, as water dilutions, onto the plant stand. For this reason the granules are made water dispersible so that a homogenous suspension which will not clog the sprayer will be obtained when the product is di¬ luted with water.Carbamoyloxyphenylcarbamate and benzofurane herbicides have conventionally been formulated as emulsion concentrates in which the active ingredient is dissolved in organic solvents and can, with the help of solution emulsifiers, be caused to mix with water to form an emulsion. These formulations have, however, the drawbacks of toxicity of the products, due to the organic solvents, inflammability of the products, as well as difficulty of obtaining a stable uncrystallizing emulsion of the product together with water. Crystallization is typical specifically of methyl-3-tolγlcarbamoyloxyphenylcarbamate.Product forms in which the active ingredients are not in a dis solved form are as such advantageous, since then the problems of toxicity, inflammability, packaging material, and storage are usually avoided, since especially in the case of foliage- acting herbicides, penetration and translocation abilities are required in order to achieve sufficient biologic efficacy. Hydrolytic decomposition is often also a disadvantage. An ac¬ tive ingredient in molecular form is, in a true liquid, capabl of penetrating through the wax and cuticle layers much more effectively than is a solid particle. For this reason, in- 

 soluble particles of the active ingredient must be as finely ground as possible, and their penetration and translocation abilities must be improved with oils, organic solvent addi¬ tions, and surfactants. In the case of carbamoyloxyphenylcarb mates in particular, it is indispensable to add exceptionally large amounts of these auxiliary agents in order to achieve a sufficient biologic efficacy. Air-jet and suspension mills are used for the grinding to produce a maximally finely divided active ingredient, preferably in the order of magnitude of 1 - 5 microns, in order to achieve

 Claims
1. A method for enhancing the efficacy of granular or tablet-form herbicidal products, such as methyl-3-m-tolyl- carbamoyloxyphenylcarbamate, ethyl-3-phenyl-carbamoyloxyphenyl carbamate, 2-ethoxy-2,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethylbenzofurane-5-yl- methane sulfonate, 5-amino-4-chloro-2-phenylpyridazine~3(24)- one and 4-amino-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-6-phenyl-l,2,4-triazine-5 one, by using activators known per se, characterized in that the activator substances and activator constituents are impreg¬ nated into and/or mixed with a solid carrier material which possibly contains auxiliary agents known per se, whereby a solid activator composition is obtained, and the obtained solid activator composition is contacted with the herbicidal product either a) by forming a layer it on the granule or tablet surface or b) by incorporating it as a core inside the granule or tablet or c) by mixing the solid components together.
2. A method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the carrier is inorganic or organic by structure or is a mixture of such substances.
3. A method according to Claim 2, characterized in that the carrier is of natural origin.
4. A method according to Claim 2 , characterized in that the carrier is of synthetic origin.
