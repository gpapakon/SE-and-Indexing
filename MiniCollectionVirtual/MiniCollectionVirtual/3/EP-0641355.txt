<ABSTRACT>
Novel steroid sulphatase inhibitors are disclosed as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing them for use in the treatment of oestrone dependent tumours, especially breast cancer. The novel steroid sulphatase inhibitors are: sulphamate esters of formula (I), where R1 and R2 are each H, alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, or together represent an alkylene group optionally containing a heteroatom e.g. -O- or -NH-; and -O-polycycle represents the residue of a polycyclic alcohol, preferably a sterol, most preferably a 3-sterol. Preferred compounds are oestrone-3-sulphamate and N,N-dimethyl oestrone-3-sulphamate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to use of novel compounds
in the manufacture of a medicament to inhibit steroid
sulphatase activity.Steroid precursors, or pro-hormones, having a sulphate group in
the 3-position of the steroid nucleus, referred to hereinafter simply
as steroid sulphates, are known to play an important part as
intermediates in steroid metabolism in the human body. Oestrone
sulphate and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA) sulphate, for example, are
known to play an important role as intermediates in the production, in
the body, of oestrogens such as oestrone and oestradiol. Oestrone
sulphate, in particular, is known, for example, to represent one of the
major circulating oestrogen precursors particularly in post-menopausal
women and oestrone sulphatase activity in breast tumours is 100-1000
fold greater than that of other enzymes involved in oestrogen formation
(James et al., Steroids, 50, 269-279 (1987)).Not only that, but oestrogens such as oestrone and oestradiol,
particularly the over-production thereof, are strongly implicated in
malignant conditions, such as breast cancer, see Breast Cancer,
Treatment and Prognosis: Ed. R.A. Stoll, pp. 156-172, Blackwell
Scientific Publications (1986), and the control of oestrogen production
is the specific target of many anti-cancer therapies, both chemotherapy
and surgical, e.g. oöphorectomy and adrenalectomy. So far as endocrine
therapy is concerned, efforts have so far tended to concentrate on
aromatase inhibitors, i.e. compounds which inhibit aromatase activity,
which activity is involved, as the accompanying oestrogen metabolic
flow diagram (Figure 1) shows, in the conversion of androgens such as
androstenedione and testosterone to oestrone and oestradiol
respectively. Pharmazie, vol. 30, no. 1, January 1975, Berlin, DD, pages 17-21 discloses a number of
compounds comprising a sulphamate group attached to a steroidal ring structure. The
sulphamate group of each of these compounds is a N,N-dialkyl-amino sulphamate.
This document teaches that the disclosed compounds may be useful in pharmaceutical
compositions.DD-A-114806 discloses (at Example 10) a N,N-dialkyl-amino sulphamate group
attached to a steroidal ring.GB-A-1 398 026, discloses, inter alia, steroid esters comprising a sulphamate group.
The sulphamate group may be a N,N-dialkyl-sulphamate.Zeitschrift für Chemie, vol. 14, no. 1, 1974, Leipzig, DE, pages 15-16 discloses
compounds comprising a steroidal ring and a sulphamate group. Each of the sulphamate
groups disclosed is an N,N-dialkyl-sulphamate. In
