<ABSTRACT>
The explosion attenuating vent cap for storage 
batteries according to the present invention features an 

electrolyte drain and baffle design adapted for 
maximizing return to the battery of any liquid which may 

enter the vent from vibration, tilting, overheating, 
overcharge and the like. The vent barrel(s) (50) include 

a step (150) to assist in closure of the fill openings, 
and baffles (80, 82, 84, 104 106, 108) within the vent 

prevent accumulation of electrolyte within the cap. The 
arrangement of the entrance (140) to the gas escape 

passage (leading through an explosion attenuation device 
(120) such as a disc of microporous polymer) is located 

on the center lines of the barrel and at the highest 
possible location within the vent to minimize the 

intrusion of electrolyte into the attenuation material. 
This location of the entrance prevents accumulation of 

electrolyte at that location. Preferably, the vent cap is 

of the ganged variety, i.e. useful for simultaneously 
capping three or more fill openings of the battery.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the art 
of electric storage batteries, for example sealed 
automotive batteries. More particularly, the invention 
relates to vent caps for such batteries which provide a 
flow path for the escape of hydrogen and oxygen formed 
during the electrochemical reactions which take place in 
such batteries. Still more specifically, the invention 
relates to a vent cap which also controls the flow of 
electrolyte which may enter the vent cap to ensure that 
it is returned to the battery cells and does not become 
entrained in the flow of gases passing through the cap or 
flow through the cap to the gas exhaust port. Conventional lead-acid batteries, such as those used 
for automobiles, generally include a number of cells 
disposed in a battery housing. Each cell typically  
 
includes a plurality of positive and negative battery 
plates or electrodes, and separators are sandwiched 
between the plates to prevent shorting and undesirable 
electron flow during the reactions which take place 
during manufacture and use of the batteries. The plates 
and separators are immersed in a liquid electrolyte in 
the cells, the most common being aqueous sulfuric acid. 
The positive plate generally is constructed of a lead-alloy 
grid covered with lead oxide, while the negative 
plate generally contains lead as the active material, 
again covering a lead alloy grid. In most battery constructions the battery housing 
includes a box-like base containing the cells and is made 
from a moldable resin. The housing is generally 
rectangular in horizontal cross-section, the cells being 
provided by vertical partitions within the housing. A 
cover is provided for the casing, the cover includes 
level terminal bushings and a series of fill holes to 
allow electrolyte to be added to the cells and to permit 
whatever servicing is required during use of the 
batteries. To prevent undesirable spillage of 
electrolyte from the fill holes, most prior batteries 
have included some sort of filler hole cap. Battery 
electrolyte spillage can be caused by a number of 
factors, including vibration or tilting as the vehicle 
with which this battery is used maneuvers during normal 
use. Electrolyte escape may also be caused by battery 
overheating, a problem especially pronounced in recent 
years with smaller car engines, which tend to run hotter 
than prior engines. The electromotive potential of each battery cell is 
determined by the chemical composition of the 
electroactive substrates employed in the

A vent cap for a battery of the type which 
includes a battery cover (152) having electrolyte fill 

holes (153) and electrolyte which may, during use, spew, 
spill, evolve or be pumped from the fill holes, the cap 

being characterized by: 
   a chamber having a floor (32) and plural 

barrels (50) arranged linearly and extending from the 
floor and arranged to be inserted into the fill holes 

(153), the floor having a generally planar portion (33) 
from which the barrels extend and an inclined portion 

(34) arranged to facilitate drainage of any electrolyte 
entering the chamber to the planar portion; and 

   the chamber including a flame arrestor (120) 
having an entrance (140) for gases which may enter the 

chamber through the barrels and an exhaust port (27), the 
entrance being located generally above a line extending 

through the centerline of the barrel openings (62). 
The vent cap of Claim 1, further characterized 
by splash guards (102) within the chamber for the 

barrels. 
The vent cap of Claim 2, further characterized
