<ABSTRACT>
The invention is a locking device for a bearing arrangement, known per se, in which at least three running rollers which are each rotatably mounted on a bearing pin and are arranged in a rotationally symmetrical fashion lie in one plane and guide and bear a running ring between them. In this arrangement, the bearing pins are arranged on a carrier device which itself is mounted so as to rotate about a central axis which is aligned with the rotational axis of the running ring so that the running ring and the carrier device can rotate at different speeds of rotation. Such an arrangement of bearings on a rotating carrier is particularly suitable for a centrifuge in which a separation chamber which is provided with a centrally attached line is to be operated in such a way that the hose is not rotated. The locking device is characterised in that the bearing pins (20) are arranged eccentrically on bolts (74) which are mounted in the carrier device (36) so as to be capable of rotating with respect to it, in that a transmission component (84, 86) which rotates or revolves at the same angular speed as the carrier device (36) engages the bolts (74) in such a way that the bolts which engage with the transmission component are rotated in relation to the carrier device simultaneously with the rotation of the transmission component, in that the transmission component (84) is coupled via at least one coupling element (94; 122, 124, 142) to a shaft (40; 140) which is mounted in the housing, and in that means are provided in order to impart to the transmission component (84, 86) a relative movement in relation to the carrier device. Either a specific arrangement of control rollers on a drive belt or else a planetary gear are provided as means for imparting the relative movement.
