<ABSTRACT>
A curvable slide rail for a curtain support and/or draw slider, in 
which the rail consists of at least one rectilinear section bar 

and at least one curvable connection element provided with 
recesses in the form of partially penetrating cuts, both having an 

essentially C-shaped cross-section defining a continuous lateral 
longitudinal slot for housing a portion of at least one slider, 

within the connection element there being embedded at least one 
tubular element enabling drawing cord elements to pass, wherein 

the at least one tubular element is open longitudinally towards 
the slot, the tubular element being arranged to receive one end of 

a support element for an element for fixing the slider to the 
drawing elements of at least one end of a curtain.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a curvable slide rail for a curtain 
support and/or draw slider. Various types of curtain support and slide rails are known. These 
are generally of hollow profiled cross-section with a lateral 
longitudinal slot through which slidable curtain support elements 
known as draw sliders or curtain carriers are inserted. European patent EP-A-473 211 describes one of such rail types, 
consisting essentially of two section bars joined together by a 
connection element which has a cross-section complementary to the 
rail. The connection element is inserted into both ends of the 
rail to hence join each rail terminal portion, provided for fixing 
to a wall, to the central portion of the rail. The connection element is provided with a plurality of variously 
shaped recesses in the form of partially penetrating cuts. These 
recesses allow curvature to a desired angle, which can be up to 
90Â° or slightly more. Two continuous rigid tubes can be embedded in a part of the 
connection element and be curved together with the connection 
element in order to collaborate in maintaining the position of 
this element once curved.  
 The main drawback of these rails is the presence of the internal 
tubes in the connection element. In this respect these tubes 
hinder or indeed prevent sliding of the drawing cord which draws 
the curtain carrier, is the slider. DE-A-4 200 286 discloses a 
section bar comprising tubular elements which are open towards a 
longitudinal slot and arranged to receive one end of support 
element.  
 The main object of the present invention is to provide a curvable 
slide rail for a support and/or draw slider which obviates said 
drawback by allowing and/or facilitating the sliding of the 
slider drawing cord over its entire length, ie including within 
the connection or curved portions. This object is attained according to the present invention by a 
curvable connection element for a slide rail for a curtain support 
and/or draw slider, as defined in 
independent claim 1. Various modifications of the rail of claim 
1 are specified in the dependent claims. The structural and operational characteristics and advantages of a 
curvable slide rail for a curtain support and/or draw slider 
according to the invention will be more apparent from the detailed 
description given hereinafter by way of non-limiting example with 
reference to the accompanying schematic drawings in which: 
Figure 1 is a plan view, at least of end portions, of a curvable 
rail with sliding curtain support

<CLAIMS>
A curvable slide rail for a curtain support and/or draw 
slider, in which said rail (11) consists of at least one rectilinear 

section bar (13, 12) and at least one curvable connection element (14) provided 
with recesses (26) in the form of partially penetrating cuts, both 

having an essentially C-shaped cross-section defining a continuous 
side longitudinal slot (16) for housing a portion of at least one 

slider (19), within said connection element (14) there being embedded at 
least one tubular element (20) enabling drawing cord elements (15) to pass, 

characterised in that said at least one tubular element (20) is open 
longitudinally towards said slot (16), said tubular element (20) being 

arranged to receive one end of a support element (24) for an element (25) 
for fixing said slider (19) to said drawing cord elements (15) of at least one 

end of a curtain, wherein 
said fixing element (25) and said support element (24) can be 

inserted through a through aperture (28) provided in that 
portion (27) of said slider (19) partly inserted into said slot 

(16). 
A curvable rail as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said tubular element (20) is a rigid element able to be curved 

together with said connection element (14), which is partially 
insertable into said section bar (13, 12) 
A curvable rail as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that said tubular element (20) has a cross-section essentially of 

"3" shape open towards said slot (16) in said rail (11). 
A curvable rail as claimed in claim 3, characterised in 
that said tubular element (20) essentially consists of two side-by-side 

channels (22, 23) open longitudinally towards said slot (16). 
A curvable rail as claimed in claim 4, characterised in 
that said two channels (22, 23) of said tubular element (20) have a curved wall 

portion (30) extending into the region facing said slot (16).  
 
A curvable rail as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said end of said support element (24) insertable into said tubular 

element (20) is in the form of a sleeve (29) complementary to at least one 
portion of an inner surface of said tubular element (20). 
A curvable rail as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said fixing element (25) is a double-arched needle. 
A curvable rail as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that said fixing element (25) and said support element (24) are rigidly 

joined together by engaging locking portions of the one onto 
portions of the other.
