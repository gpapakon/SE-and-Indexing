<ABSTRACT>
A compact and light weight axle unit with good durability and reliability
for driving a vehicle wheel is provided wherein the splined bore 28 of the hub

6a is engaged with the splined shaft 30 of the drive shaft member 29, and a
stop ring 35 is held between the outer engagement groove 25 on the inner

peripheral surface of the splined bore 28 and the inner engagement groove 24
on the outer peripheral surface of the splined shaft 30 to prevent the splined

shaft 30 from being removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an axle unit for driving a vehicle wheel,
being a so-called fourth generation hub unit, used for rotatably supporting a
driven wheel {the front wheels of an FF vehicle (front engine, front wheel
drive vehicle), the rear wheels of an FR vehicle (front engine, rear wheel drive
vehicle), the rear wheels of an RR vehicle (rear engine, rear wheel drive
vehicle) and all wheels of a 4WD vehicle (four-wheel-drive vehicle)}
supported on an independent suspension, relative to the suspension unit, and
driving the driven wheel. The fourth generation hub unit has a hub unit and a
constant velocity joint detachably combined with each other.Various kinds of axle units have heretofore been used, in which an outer
ring and an inner ring are rotatably combined via rolling members in order to
rotatably support a wheel on a suspension unit. It is necessary for the axle unit
used for supporting the driven wheel on the independent suspension and
rotatably driving the driven wheel, to smoothly transmit the rotation of the
drive shaft to the wheel (while ensuring constant velocity); in combination 
with a constant velocity joint, regardless of relative displacement between the
differential gear and the driven wheel and the steering angle imparted to the
wheel. The axle unit for driving the vehicle wheel, which is a so-called fourth
generation hub unit, can be combined with such a constant velocity joint and
can be constructed relatively compact and lightweight. Such an axle unit has
heretofore been disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Tokukai Hei No. 7-317754,
or in US Patent No. 5,674,011.FIG.36 shows one example of a conventional construction disclosed in
Japanese Patent Publication Tokukai Hei No. 7-317754. An outer ring 1
which does not rotate while being supported on the suspension unit when
incorporated into the vehicle, has an outward flange shaped attachment portion
2 for supporting the outer ring on the suspension unit, on the outer peripheral
face thereof, and two rows of outer ring raceways 3 on the inner peripheral
face thereof.On the radially inner side of the outer ring 1, a hub 6 formed by
combining a first element 4 and a second element 5 is disposed. Of these, the
first element 4 is formed in a cylindrical form having an mount flange 7 for
supporting the wheel on one end side (on the left end side in FIG. 36), and an
inner ring raceway 8 on the other end side (on the right end side in FIG.36).
The second element 5 has on one end side (the left end side in FIG. 36) a
cylindri

<CLAIMS>
An axle unit for driving a vehicle wheel combined
with a constant velocity joint and comprising:


an outer ring being stationary during use and having
an inner peripheral surface formed with an outer ring

raceway,
a hub having an outer peripheral surface formed with
a mount flange for wheel support on one end side thereof,

with an inner ring raceway on the other end side thereof,
directly thereon or on an inner ring thereon, and with a

splined bore at a center portion thereof,
a drive shaft member provided with a splined shaft
on one end side thereof to form a splined engagement

portion between the splined shaft and the splined bore
and with a housing portion on the other end side thereof,

the housing portion forming an outer ring of the constant
velocity joint,
a plurality of rolling members rotatably provided
between the outer ring raceway and the inner ring

raceway,
a connecting member being different from the hub,
such that part of the connecting member is mounted to the

one end of the drive shaft member on the one end side
thereof, that the part of the connecting member and part

of the drive shaft member cooperate with each other to
position the hub in the axial direction with reference to

the connecting member and drive shaft member,
and
a seal member made of a resilient member and
resiliently held between the hub and the drive shaft

member such that the spline engagement portion between
the splined bore and the splined shaft is sealed with the

seal member.
The axle unit for driving the vehicle wheel of Claim
1, wherein the splined engagement portion is provided

with lubricant.
The axle unit for driving the vehicle wheel of Claim
1, wherein the housing portion has an outer peripheral

surface formed with a brim portion.
