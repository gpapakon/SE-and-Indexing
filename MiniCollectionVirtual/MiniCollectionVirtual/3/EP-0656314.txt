<ABSTRACT>
A modular push button controller (1) for 
a crane, consisting of a push button unit 

(2) and and at least one module (41...44) 
attached to it with a detachable joint 

(27) and transmitting or sending a control 
signal (6, 11, 14, 17) to the crane. 

The detachable joint (27) permits each 
one of the modules to be separately 

attached to and detached from the same 
push button unit (2). The modules transmitting 

or sending a control signal are 
provided with plug-and-socket connectors 

(9), each one of which is compatible with 
the corresponding connector in the push 

button unit (2). 
The signal sent to the crane by the modules 
is a parallel signal (6), a serial 

signal (11), a radio signal (14) or an IR 
light signal (17) and the module may 

contain a signal converter (8) between 
itself and the push button unit (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a push-button controller
for a crane and to a crane control apparatus connected to it
via a signal link.Crane controllers are traditionally built as units fitted to
suit a particular crane. This means that the controllers for
e.g. three cranes using identical machineries but different
control methods are each fitted individually to match the
crane machineries. Thus the control signals of a normal
contactor-controlled crane are taken directly from the crane
controller's push buttons via a cable to the control
apparatus of the crane.If a crane of the same type is equipped e.g. with a radio
control system, the controller is traditionally manufactured
as a complete set with push buttons and radio transmitter
integrated in a common controller box.If a crane of the same type is equipped with an infrared
control system, the push buttons and infrared transmitter
are traditionally integrated with the box as single unit.Corresponding integration is also employed in the equipment
used for the handling of the signals in the crane itself.
For example, the receiver for radio control is integrated
with the parallel interface from which the signals are taken
in parallel form to the crane drives.A drawback in known technology is the difficulty of changing
the control method. Another notable drawback of known technology
is the difficulty of achieving a uniform appearance
and image of the controller because the whole controller
with all its equipment is handled at the same time. Achieving
a uniform appearance and image of the controller is of
course possible, but it is expensive. EP-A-432 284 discloses a push botton controller for a crane and
a crane control apparatus connected to it via a signal link,
wherein the push botton controller consists of a push botton
unit and at least one module attached to it with a detachable
joint and transmitting or sending a control signal through a
cable to the crane.FR-A-1 113 581 discloses a push botton unit which may be used
for all kinds of electric drives which push botton unit comprises
push botton modules which can be connected to the push
botton controller via a plug and socket connection. The object of the present invention is to eliminate some of
the drawbacks of previously known technology and to achieve
a crane control method that permits easier and cheaper transition
to a different control method, which can be utilized
e.g. in the renovation of cranes.The invention is characterized by what is said in the characterization
part of claim 1.The
