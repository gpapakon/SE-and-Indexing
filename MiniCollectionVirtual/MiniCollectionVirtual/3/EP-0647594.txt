<ABSTRACT>
A water treatment apparatus has been described which has a flanged cylinder shell and an elongate electrode arranged in the centre of the shell, a generator for low electrostatic voltage being arranged outside the shell, and a water inlet and a water outlet, in addition to a pair of insulation pieces, being provided at the two ends of the shell. The entire shell is lined on its entire inner surface with a highly conductive material having a negative electric potential so that it can act as a negative electrode. An electrostatic field of low voltage is built up between the positive and negative electrode in the interior of the shell after switching on the generator. It is characterizing that a preset electron density is generated when the water flows through the field in order to generate a predetermined amount of active oxygen in the water for sterilizing more than 95% of the bacteria and the algae in the water flowing through.
