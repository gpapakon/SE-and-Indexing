<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
forming high-quality thin films of semiconductors, 
dielectrics and metals to be used in the electronic 
industry and the optical industry. Thin films of semiconductors, dielectrics and 
metals have widely been applied to electronic devices 
and optical instruments, and high-quality thin films 
meeting the requirements of advanced electronic devices 
and optical instruments have been needed. Ex-situ 
measurement of the quality of films, i.e., measurement 
of the quality of films after the films have been 
formed, does not suffice for providing such high-quality 
films. Generally, since a film is formed by the 
condensation of the elements of source gases having high 
energy, modes of nuclei formation and growth of nuclei 
on the surface of a substrate are greatly dependent on 
film forming conditions. Particularly, variation of 
parameters of the film forming process including the 
temperature of the substrate, the pressures of the  
 
source gases, plasma density and such entails formation 
of a film structure having an irregular morphology and 
voids in the film. As is generally known, the 
morphology of the film structure and voids in the film 
influence greatly the mechanical, optical and electrical 
characteristics of the film, and the irregular 
morphology and voids are causes of cracking. 
Accordingly, the quality of the film must be monitored 
during the film forming process through the in situ 
measurement of the quality of the film, i.e., 
measurement of the quality of the film during the film 
forming process, and a film forming apparatus provided 
with a film monitor capable of monitoring the film to 
detect the variation of the quality of the film during 
the film forming process is necessary. The in situ 
measurement of the quality of the film must be started 
in the initial stage of the film forming process in 
which the film is very thin. The conventional film forming apparatus is 
provided with a quartz oscillation type film thickness 
monitor for measuring the varying thickness of the film, 
an ellipsometer and a reflection electron monitor for 
measuring the physical properties of the film, and an X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscope (XPS) for inspecting the 
condition of the film.  A technique for detecting matters in the 
environment with glass fibers is disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Application No. 4-503251, and a technique for 
changing the reflectivity through the reaction between a 
solution and a waveguide immersed in the solution is
