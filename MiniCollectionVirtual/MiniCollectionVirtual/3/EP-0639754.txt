<ABSTRACT>
An arithmetic control circuit (600) drives and controls a motor (209) on the basis of a measurement result by a measuring 
portion (300), and a frame holding device (100) is subjected to tilting rotation control so that the center line (503) of the measurement 

portion of a V-shaped groove (502) of a lens frame (501) is in parallel with a reference measurement plane SO. Coordinates 
of each point of the V-shaped groove (502) are sequentially measured by the measurement portion (300), and the shape of an eyeglass 

frame (501) is computed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for
digitally measuring the shape of a spectacle frame lens
rim or template copying the lens rim, and more
particularly to a frame shape measuring apparatus which
is suitable to be used together with a grinder for
grinding a pre-edge spectacle lens in accordance with
information of the shape of a lens rim or template.With respect to a frame shape measuring
apparatus of the type mentioned above, there is known
an apparatus in which a spectacle frame is held on a
holding surface of a body of a frame holding apparatus
with both eye portions pressed against the holding
surface by a spring-biased holding bar, a bead-like
feeler is moved contacting an inner side of a V-shaped
groove of the spectacle frame, a moving locus of the
feeler is three-dimensionally detected thereby to
measure the shape of the spectacle frame.It is also known from document EP-A-0 238 877 a
frame shape measuring apparatus, in which a lens rim of
a spectacle frame is held on the upper face of a
support plate, rotatably received in a stationary ring.
A vertical rod extending through an opening of the
plate carries a finger at its upper end. Springs
maintain the finger in a V-shaped groove formed in the
lens rim, thanks to vertical translations of the rod in
a support and thanks to horizontal translations of the
support. Both translations are measured when the plate
is rotated, to determine the shape of the rim. In document EP-A-0 160 985, it is disclosed a
method for calculating the relationship between a
pre-edged lens and a spectacle frame, for use in a lens
edging machine. A lens rim of a spectacle frame is
mounted in a frame holding member, itself received on a
frame holding apparatus. A detector is provided with a
feeler adapted to engage a V-shaped groove formed in
the lens rim. The detector measures the polar
coordinates of the groove with respect to the geometric
center of the lens rim.Finally, document EP-A-0 190 450 describes a
frame shape measuring apparatus according to the
preamble of claim 1.However, since the spectacle frame is generally
curved, even if the lens rim is held by the holding bar
with a bridge side for connecting the pair of lens rims
allowed to contact the holding surface, a peripheral
portion of the opposite side (that portion where a
sidepiece, this being also served as an ear hunger, is
to be attached) is held in a "floating state" on the
holding surface and therefore, a reference measuring
surface and the lens rim are 
inclined (frame inclination).Since the
