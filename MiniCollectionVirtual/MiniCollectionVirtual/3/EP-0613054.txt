<ABSTRACT>
The surface of an electrostatic recording sheet, which 
has a recording (2) layer of a liquid crystal polymer directly or 

indirectly on a substrate (1), is selectively charged by a head 
before or after heating the liquid crystal polymer to a 

temperature higher than the temperature of forming the liquid 
crystal phase of the polymer, thus enlarging the domain size of 

the liquid crystal phase and recording information. Information 

is deleted by heating the liquid crystal polymer to a temperature 
higher than that of forming an isotropic phase of the polymer and 

then cooling the polymer uniformly with no application of voltage 
to the head, thus reducing the domain size and deleting recorded 

information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a reversible electrostatic 
recording sheet which is capable of recording, saving and having 
information deleted from it and can be used repeatedly, and an 
electrostatic recording method. The electrostatic recording method of adhering toner to a 
charged section of a nonrecording material has been applied as a 
conventional recording method for facsimiles and the like. 
Electrostatic recording sheets colored by heating, heat transfer 
recording techniques transferring ink by heating, and the like 
have also been used as methods of recording documents and 
pictures. Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application No. Hei 
1-184640 discloses an optical recording medium capable of 
recording information and being erased by a photon to heat mode 
recording. Recursive thermal recording materials for recording and 
deleting observable information have also been disclosed in 
Published Unexamined Japanese Patent Application Nos. Hei 
2-175280, Hei 2-236518 and Hei 3-159785. However, since conventional electrostatic recording and 
thermal recording methods cannot remove transferred toner or ink  
 
and colored sections, it has been difficult to repeatedly use 
recording paper with information recorded on it. Because conventional thermal recording media and 
recursive thermal recording materials employ optical heads using 
a laser light source and thermal heads or the like as recording 
means, they have the problems of low energy efficiency and slow 
recording speed. An objective of the invention is to provide an 
electrostatic recording sheet, which has high recording 
sensitivity and can provide direct thermally reversible recording 
and deletion of information, and an electrostatic recording 
method which achieves high speed recording by using the 
electrostatic recording sheet of the invention. In order to accomplish these objectives, the 
electrostatic recording sheet of the invention comprises a 
recording layer formed directly on a substrate or indirectly on 
at least one other layer on the substrate, which comprises a 
liquid crystal polymer used for reversible electrostatic 
recording. It is preferable in this composition that the liquid 
crystal polymer is a thermotropic liquid crystal polymer. It is also preferable in this composition that a 
conductive layer is formed between the substrate and the 
recording layer.  It is further preferable in this composition that the 
conductive layer is colored. It is preferable in this composition that the conductive 
layer is made
