<ABSTRACT>
A travois assembly, comprises a load-carrying frame having a lower end 
and an upper end. A single wheel is rotatably mounted on said lower end of said 

load carrying frame. A user harness includes a single vertical frame member 
attached to a horizontal frame member at a lower end thereof, a back pad attached 

to the vertical frame member at an upper end thereof, a belt circumferentially 
attached to the horizontal frame member, a pair of shoulder straps each having a 

first end attached to the back pad and a second end attached to the horizontal 
frame member. The load carrying frame is attached to the user hamess by a 

universal joint having a first end rigidly attached to the upper end of the load 
carrying frame and a second end attached to the vertical frame member of the user 

harness.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wheeled travois for towing supplies and 
other loads behind an individual. The wheeled travois of the present invention is 
particularly useful for towing supplies and other loads over uneven terrain. The prior art presents a diverse array of embodiments of different devices 
which may be employed to tow or carry a load behind an individual. The object of 
these devices is to assist an individual in transporting a load, especially those 
loads weighing more than an individual may comfortably carry for any significant 
distance. Though many different types of carriers exist, including carriers which are 
handheld and may be either pushed or pulled and carriers which are attached to 
and towed behind an individual, each of the carriers found in the prior art have at 
least one of several problems including stability, limitations of maneuverability or 
desirability of function. Of particular interest herein are carriers with a load carrying 
frame having a single wheel structure which may be attached to and towed behind 
an individual.  Prior art descriptions of carts or carriers employing a single wheel structure 
that may be either pushed or pulled include Murphy, U.S. Patent No. 3,055,449; 
Strand, U.S. Patent No. 3,550,997; Tracy, et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,560,015; Fraser, 
U.S. Patent No. 4,063,744; and Cockram, U.S. Patent No. 4,171,139. Of 
these,Tracy, et al. and Strand disclose a backpack frame which upon removal may 
be converted to a single wheeled cart. There are several readily apparent advantages to be gained with a travois 
structure which incorporates the features of a single wheel and an attachment for 
towing behind an individual. These features when embodied in a travois will 
narrow its profile, free the hands of the user, and allow the user to travel a greater 
distance with the load. However, attempts in the prior art to embody these features 
have not been satisfactory. A common design disclosed by the prior art teaches a travois which is 
attached to the user at two points, and includes embodiments where the 
attachment is made to either a belt or an over the shoulder harness worn by the 
user. While the use of two points of attachment creates a stable arrangement, it 
imposes as substantial trade-offs unwanted limitations on maneuverability and 
desirability of use due in part to limitations on side to side movement and additional 
weight in the frame. Embodiments of a travois using two points of attachment may 
be found in United States Patent
