<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting male infertility 
comprising administering to a human in need thereof an 

effective amount of a compound having the formula 

   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine, hexamethyleneamino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
An estimated one in five couples in the United 
States has some degree of infertility. Infertility is 
defined as the inability of a heterosexual couple to 
achieve a pregnancy within one year of unprotected 
intercourse (Cecil Textbook of Medicine, W.B. Saunders 
Company, 19th Ed., p. 1339-1340, (1992)). Major 
etiological factors include ovulatory dysfunction, abnormal 
tubal function, cervical factors, and male sperm factors. 
(The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, Merck Research 
Laboratories, 16th Ed., p. 1768-1770, (1992)). An 
estimated five to six percent of men in the reproductive 
age group are infertile. Most causes of male infertility 
are due to an abnormal sperm count or low semen quality. A majority of problems associated with fertility 
in males stem from changes in testosterone levels. In 
particular, decreases in concentration of this steroid can 
result in infertility and impotence. Endogenous estrogen 
has been well-documented to serve as a regulatory factor in 
testosterone production by interaction with the estrogen 
receptor (Nozu, K. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1915 (1981); 
Brinkman, A. et al., Endocrinology, 110, 1834 (1982)). 
Thus, intratesticular estrogen plays a key role in 
testosterone steroidogenisis with increased levels of 
estrogen inhibiting testosterone production (Cigorraga, 
S.B. et al., J. Clin. Invest. 65, 699 (1982); Padron, 
R.S.J., Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 50, 1100 (1980)). A need 
exists for new methods of treating or preventing male 
infertility. This invention provides methods for inhibiting 
male infertility comprising administering to a human in 
need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I     wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 
wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;
 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 
pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino; and 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. The current invention concerns the discovery 
that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes 
(benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for 
inhibiting male infertility. The methods of treatment 
provided by this invention are practiced by administering 
to a human in need thereof a dose of a compound of formula 
I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, 
that is effective to inhibit male infertility. The term 
inhibit is defined to include its generally accepted 
meaning which includes prophylactically treating a human 
subject to incurring the problem
