<ABSTRACT>
An angiotensin II antagonist compound is 
administered to mammals with viral disease. This 

administration ameliorates virus-associated cell 
injuries, producing therapeutic effects in viral 

diseases. This compound is also useful for the 
prevention of such diseases.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical
composition for viral diseases which comprises an
angiotensin II antagonist compound as an active ingredient.Virus vaccines are chiefly used in the prevention
of viral diseases but each vaccine is specific and
effective only for the corresponding virus. While
there exist many kinds of viruses, vaccines
commercially available today are limited in kind.
Furthermore, each virus has many mutants and it is
often the case that a vaccine is not effective for all
strains of the same virus. It is also a very difficult
task to develop vaccines with low risks of side
effects.Meanwhile, a variety of antiviral drugs
(aciclovir, ganciclovir, Ala-A, etc.) have been
developed and clinically in use but they are effective
only for very limited types of viral infections and no
drug is available that is effective for a variety of
viral diseases. Moreover, the administration of such
antiviral drugs may entail severe adverse reactions
prohibiting clinical application. In recent years,
interferons have come to be used in the treatment of
some diseases inclusive of viral hepatitis but side
effects inclusive of fever have been reported with high
frequencies. Moreover, while interferons do actually
inhibit the proliferation of viruses, there is no
report suggesting that they directly protect the cells
from damages. Gamma-globulin is prevalently used in
the treatment of viral diseases but clinical responses
are not necessarily constant and definite. It is disclosed in Supplement to the Journal of the
American College of Cardiology, Vol. 21 (2), February, 1993,
Page 197a that the angiotensin II antagonist losartan was
tested in the treatment of viral myocarditis in mice. However,
it was found that only an extremely high dosis of losartan was
effective and that other compounds such as captopril are much
more effective for treating viral myocarditis in mice.Viruses vary a great deal as mentioned above and it is
difficult to institute therapies specific to the respective
viruses. Therefore, it is an objective of paramount importance
to prevent or ameliorate cellular damages in various organs
which occur in a variety of viral diseases. It is generally
acknowledged that the cell injury in viral diseases includes
not only direct damages inflicted by the proliferation of
viruses but is associated with various immunologic reactions
elicited by infection with viruses. The present invention has
for its object to provide a prophylactic/therapeutic regimen
for viral diseases which is directed to
