Process for the manufacture of a micromachined 
device adapted to contain or to convey fluid substances in 

particular liquids, this process consisting of : 

machining a silicon plate (4) by means of selective 
oxidation and photolithographic operations to form therein 

at least one cavity (7, 12) adapted to contain or to convey 
said fluid, and to oxidize the wall of said cavity to render 

it hydrophilic, and 
to complete said device by fixing closure plates 
(1, 5) to the body of the device thus formed, 
 
characterized in that it consists in : 


preceding said machining operations by covering the 
surfaces of said plate (4) adapted to be in contact with 

said closure plates (1, 5) with a screening layer (25) 
resistant to said machining operations; 
after completing said machining operations, 
oxidizing the surfaces of said plate adapted to be exposed 

to said fluid to form thereon an oxide layer (32) favouring 
the wettability of these surfaces; 
removing said screening layer (25); and 
fixing said closure plates (1, 5) to said plate 
(4). 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said screening layer (25) is made of silicon nitride and 

deposited on said plate (4) with interposition of an 
intermediate oxide layer (24). 
Process according to claim 2, characterized in that 
said intermediate oxide layer (24) has a thickness less than 

that said oxide layer (31) favouring the wettability, the 
process also consisting, after removal of said screening 

layer, of eliminating said intermediate oxide layer while 
said oxide layer favouring wettability is uncovered. 
Device produced by micromachining silicon adapted 
to contain or convey a fluid, characterized in that it is 

obtained according to the process as defined in any one of 
claims 1 to 3.
