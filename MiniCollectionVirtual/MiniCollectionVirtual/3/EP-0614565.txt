Method for determining the position in a cassette recorder having a tape 
thread-in and thread-out mechanism with position switches (A,B), in which the 

output signals of the switches (A,B) are coupled via a resistor network R
1
, R
2
, 
R
3
), the output of which is connected to the input of an analog-to-digital 
converter (W), 
characterised in that
 during a calibrating operation the voltage 
value assigned to each individual position is measured at the output of the resistor 

network (R
1
, R
2
, R
3
) the corresponding digital values are entered into a memory 
and used as a desired value during normal operation. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the calibrating operation ends 
automatically when a prescribed number of position 

changes have occured. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the calibrating operation is 
divided into two phases which are differentiated through 

the direction of movement of the mechanism and the 
counting direction of a position counter. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 always the instantaneous voltage 
value is compared with the preceeding voltage value in a 

comparator. 
Method according to claim 4, 
characteriized 
in that
 each time upon registering a 
deviation of the instantaneous voltace value from the  

 
preceeding voltage value, the movement of the mechanism 

is stopped, a predetermined number of voltage 
measurements is carried out and the count of the 

position counter is altered. 
Method according to claim 4, 
characterized 
in that
 the average value is formed from 
the predetermined number of measurements. 
Method according to claim 2 and 6, 
characterized 
in that
 a new total average value is 
calculated from the average values measured for the 

various phases. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the calibrating operation is 
performed at a mechanism speed which is lower then the 

speed of the mechanism during normal operation. 
Method according to claim 8, 
characterized 
in that
 the reduction in mechanism speed 
is carried out through an alteration to the switch-on 

period of the motor driving the mechanism. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the starting position for the 
calibrating operation is determined by a switch inquiry. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the starting position for the 
calibrating operation is carried out by measuring the 

current supplied by the resistor network. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the starting position for the 
calibrating operation is determined in a time-controlled 

manner.  
 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in that
 the initiation of the calibrating 
operation is carried out within a test operation. 
Method according to claim 3, 4, 6, 8 and 9, 

characterized in that
 the inquiry of the 
resistor network line, the position counting, the 

comparison, the forming of the average value, the 
controlling of the motor driving the mechanism and the 

storing of the voltage value determined are carried out 
by a microprocessor.
