<ABSTRACT>
In a method to control the metering rate in a loss-in-weight feeder, apart from a filling level compensation characteristic which reproduces the dependence of the setting signal value on the filling level of the bulk material, a metering rate profile is also used to control the feed rate of the loss-in-weight feeder during a control action, using a setting signal value which corresponds as accurately as possible to the desired metering rate. The metering rate profile is determined by way of different actual metering rate values and the setting signal values necessary for reaching these actual metering rate values.

Method of controlling the dosing performance of a 
differential dosing weigher, in which a delivery speed 

adjusting signal dependent upon the container level is used in 
a dosing control system during a control operation in order to 

achieve or maintain the desired dosing performance,
characterised by
 the following procedural steps: 

a) measurement and storage or inputting, into the dosing 
control system, of an apparatus-specific and product-specific 

dosing performance profile (DLP) consisting of different 
actual dosing performance values and of the adjusting signal 

values (N) which are necessary for achieving the said actual 
dosing performance values, the respective container levels 

(BP) being stored away as additional parameters, 
b) measurement and storage or inputting, into the dosing 
control system, of a filling height compensation 

characteristic (FHK) consisting of adjusting signal values (N) 
which are necessary for maintaining one or more constant 

dosing performances (m ˙
FHK
), in dependence upon different 
container levels (BP). 
c) establishing of the difference value (ΔN) between that 
adjusting signal value which is assigned, in the filling 

height compensation characteristic, to the container level 
(BP
DLP
) of the dosing performance profile (DLP), which 
container level is stored as a parameter, and that adjusting 

signal value which is assigned to an actual container level 
(BP
ist
), and 
d) control of the delivery speed with an adjusting signal 
value which is assigned, on the basis of the dosing 

performance profile (DLP), to a predeterminable dosing 
performance, and by which the difference value (ΔN) 

established from the filling height compensation 
characteristic is corrected. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the 
adjusting signal difference value (ΔN) is corrected by means 

of a rectification factor which consists of the ratio of a 
specific dosing performance (m ˙) to that constant dosing 

performance (m ˙
FHK
) at which the filling height compensation 
characteristic has been established. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
dosing performance profile (DLP) established at different 

container levels (BP) is normalised, by means of normalising 
correction values (ΔN
norm
) obtained from the filling height 
compensation characteristic (FHK), to a constant normalising 

container level (BP
norm
), the normalising correction value 
(ΔN
norm
) forming a first component of the adjusting signal 
difference value (ΔN),
 
and that there is established, from the filling heig
ht 
compensation characteristic (FHK), a remnant correction value 

(ΔN') for correcting the adjusting signal (N) on the basis of 
the normalised dosing performance profile (DLP
norm
), which 
remnant correction value (ΔN') produces, in conjunction with 

the corresponding normalising correction value (ΔN
norm
), the 
overall difference value (ΔN) for correcting the adjusting 

signal (N), the remnant correction value (ΔN') being 
established from the difference between that adjusting signal 

value which is assigned to the normalising container level 
(BP
norm
) in accordance with the filling height compensation 
characteristic (FHK), and that adjusting signal value which is 

assigned to an actual container level (BP
ist
). 
Method of controlling the dosing performance of a 
differential dosing weigher, in which a delivery speed 

adjusting signal dependent upon the container level is used in 
a dosing control system during a control operation in order to 

achieve or maintain the desired dosing performance,
characterised by
 the following procedural steps:  
 


a) measurement and storage or inputting, into the dosing 
control system, of an apparatus-specific and product-specific 

dosing performance profile (DLP) consisting of different 
actual dosing performance values (m ˙) and of the adjusting 

signal values (N) which are necessary for achieving the said 
actual dosing performance values, the respective container 

levels (BP) being stored away as additional parameters, 
b) measurement and storage or inputting, into the dosing 
control system, of a filling height compensation 

characteristic (FHK) consisting of actual dosing performance 
values (m ˙) in dependence upon different container levels (BP) 

at one or more constant adjusting signal values (N
FHK
), 
c) establishing of the difference value (Δm ˙) between that 
dosing performance value which is assigned, in the filling 

height compensation characteristic, to the container level 
(BP
DLP
) of the dosing performance profile (DLP), which 
container level is stored as a parameter, and that dosing 

performance value which is assigned to an actual container 
level (BP
ist
), and 
d) control of the delivery speed with an adjusting signal 
value which is assigned, on the basis of a corrected dosing 

performance profile (DLP
korr
), to a predeterminable dosing 
performance, the corrected dosing performance profile (DLP
korr
) 
being corrected by the difference value (Δm ˙) established from 

the filling height compensation characteristic. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in that the 
dosing performance difference value (Δm ˙) is corrected by means 

of a rectification factor which consists of the ratio of a 
specific adjusting signal value (N) to that constant adjusting 

signal value (N
FHK
) at which the filling height compensation 
characteristic has been established.  

 
Method according to claim 4 or 5, characterised in that the 
dosing performance profile (DLP) established at different 

container levels (BP) is normalised, by means of normalising 
correction values obtained from the filling height 

compensation characteristic (FHK), to a constant normalising 
container level, the normalising correction value forming a 

first component of the dosing performance difference value 
(Δm ˙), and that there is established, from the filling height 

compensation characteristic (FHK), a remnant correction value 
for the further correction of the dosing performance profile, 

which remnant correction value produces, in conjunction with 
the corresponding normalising correction value, the overall 

difference value (Δm ˙) for correcting the dosing performance 
profile, the remnant correction value being established from 

the difference between that dosing performance which is 
assigned to the normalising container level in accordance with 

the filling height compensation characteristic, and that 
dosing performance which is assigned to an actual container 

level. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in 
that the bulk product density of the material to be dosed is 

stored away as an additional parameter in the dosing 
performance profile (DLP), and used for correcting the 

adjusting signal value (N). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in 
that, in order to determine the dosing performance profile 

(DLP), a number of actual dosing performance values, and the 
adjusting signal values (N) necessary for achieving the said 

actual dosing performance values, are stored away, and other 
values, particularly ones which lie between them, are 

determined by preferably linear interpolation or 
extrapolation. 
Method according to claim 8, characterised in that, in 
order to determine the dosing performance profile (DLP), three  

 
to ten actual dosing performance values, which are preferably 

spaced apart in a regular manner, are determined. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in 
that at least one theoretical working point, which is 

determined from the dosing performance profile (DLP) and the 
filling height compensation characteristic (FHK) and 

predetermined by the ideal dosing performance, the corrected 
adjusting signal value assigned to the latter, and the 

container level (BP), is compared with at least one working 
point which is measured during the regulating operation and 

predetermined by the actual dosing performance measured, the 
actual adjusting signal value of the regulator and the 

container level measured, and that a correction value, which 
takes account of the deviation of the theoretical working 

point from the measured working point, for the further 
correction of the theoretical adjusting signal value for the 

control operation is formed and/or an alarm is emitted, if the 
deviation of the theoretical working point from the measured 

working point exceeds a predeterminable maximum value.
