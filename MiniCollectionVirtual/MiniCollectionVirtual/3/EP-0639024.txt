<ABSTRACT>
A method for generating a screened reproduction of an 
image including the steps of providing a representation of an 

original having input density values representing the grey levels 
of various locations of the original for a given color separation, 

defining a desired irregular screen function for the image 
and writing screen segments in a line by line fashion, wherein 

each screen segment is a line whose length and location is determined 
by employing the input density values of the original and 

the desired irregular screen function.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to screened image reproduction
and more particularly to a method and apparatus for
electronically generating a screened reproduction of an image.Electronic screening for image reproduction is well
known in the art. According to a well known technique described
in U.S. Patent 4,456,924 of the present assignee, for each
screened dot, a multiplicity of coordinates of a laser plotter
are translated into screen-cell coordinates. A corresponding cell
memory is preloaded by threshold values, defining a cell memory
matrix. Input digitized scanned density values of an image, such
as a color separation, are compared with the threshold values,
cell by cell. The results provide an on/off control input for a
laser plotter.U.S. Patent 4,149,183 describes an electronic halftone
generator wherein a halftone signal is generated by pulse width
modulating or comparing the scanned or video signal with a periodic
analog signal having two frequencies and phases to create a
dot pattern output which is a function of the frequency and phase
of the two combined modulating signals. The halftone reproduction
generated has variable dot configurations that are controllable
to enable both rotation of the dot pattern and geometric modifications
of the dot pattern.U.S. Patent 5,079,721 of the present assignee/applicant
describes apparatus and a technique for generating a screened
reproduction of an image comprising the steps of providing a
representation of an original having input density values representing
the grey levels of various locations of the original for
a given color separation, defining a desired screen dot arrangement
for the image, writing screen dots in a line by line fashion,
wherein each screen dot is made up of a plurality of lines 
whose length and location determines the dot
configuration and whose length and location is determined
by an analog operation employing the input density values
of the original and the desired screen dot arrangement.U.S. Patent 4,040,094 describes a method and
apparatus for electronic screening of a graphic image to
be reproduced by printing. The density of the graphic
image is determined repetitively during the digital
generation of each dot which will form a part of the
half-tone image when produced, and the dot is modified
according to changes in the density. Thus the structure
of any halftone dot may be modified during its
construction.EP-A-0141869 discloses a method and apparatus for
producing half-tone printing forms with rotated screens
