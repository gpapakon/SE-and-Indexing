<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to substituted 2β-morpholino-androstane 
derivatives, a process for the preparation 
thereof, a pharmaceutical composition containing the 
same, as well as the use of these steroids as an 
anaesthetic drug. Androstanes are steroids having a skeleton of the 
formula hexadecahydro-10,13-dimethyl-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene. 
The compounds with only a 13-methyl group 
are named 19-norandrostanes. Androstanes with an ethyl 
side-chain at the 17-position are named pregnanes. For 
reasons of simplicity only the term androstane is used 
in this description. The term androstane may, however, 
also be read as 19-norandrostane, pregnane, or 19-norpregnane. 
In the experimental section the usual chemical 
names are used. Derivatives of androstane having intravenous anaesthetic 
activity are known in the art. They have less side 
effects when compared with other steroidal anaesthetics. 
These steroids may carry substituents at several 
positions (see for example British patents 1,376,892, 
1,380,248, 1,430,932, 1,570,394, 1,377,608, and 
1,581,234; and US patent 3,983,111). A well-known 
example is alfaxalone as disclosed in German patent 
2,030,402. 
It has been found these steroids when substituted by 
various groups may have advantageous properties, but 
substitution may also lead to decrease of anaesthetic 
activity. 
It is of particular advantage to have water soluble 
anaesthetic compounds, since such compounds can 
advantageously be used for intravenous anaesthesia. 
Anaesthetic androstane derivatives having groups which  
 
improve the water solubility at various positions of the 
steroid skeleton, are known. Introduction of such groups 
does not always lead to increase of activity or 
stability. In the search for water-soluble anaesthetic 
androstane derivatives having intravenous activity, 2β-amino-derivatives, 
and particularly 2β-morpholino 
derivatives were claimed to be favourable. Androstane 
derivatives having a morpholino group attached at the 
2β-, 11α- or 21- positions of the steroid are disclosed 
as compounds with anaesthetic activity, for example in 
British patents 1,377,608 and 1,581,234, and in US 
patent 3,983,111. However, the 2β-morpholino derivative 
of alfaxalone is significantly less active than 
alfaxalone itself. It has now been found that substituted 2β-morpholino-androstane 
derivatives, the morpholino group of which is 
substituted by alkyl, spirocycloalkyl, phenyl, or 
benzyl, are very potent anaesthetic compounds having in 
general a better therapeutic
