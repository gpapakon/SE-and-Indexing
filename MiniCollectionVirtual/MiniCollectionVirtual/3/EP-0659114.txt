<ABSTRACT>
A flexible protective and waterproofing membrane (10) includes a flexible polymeric sheet (14) having an open-textured surface on each of its opposite faces defining interconnected internal voids open to the atmosphere and capable of being impregnated by a cementitious bonding material. In the described preferred embodiments, each of the open-textured surfaces is a fibrous surface layer (15, 16), and wherein at least one of the fibrous surface layers is pre-impregnated with a cementitious bonding material based on Portland or other water hardenable cement (17) which is substantially in a non-hydrated condition.

<DESCRIPTION>
 FLEXIBLE PROTECTIVE MEMBRANE PARTICULARLY USEFUL FORWATERPROOFING AND PROTECTING REINFORCEDCONCRETE BODIES AND METAL PIPESThe present invention relates to protective membranes for providing protection against corrosion and/or water penetration. The protective membrane of the present invention is capable of adhering to cement mortar or concrete that sets and hardens whilst in contact with it. It is therefore particularly useful for providing such protection for buildings and concrete structures and also to metal pipes and is therefore described below with respect to such applications, but it will be appreciated that the invention could advantageously be used in other applications, e.g., for protecting sheet metal constructions.The main cause of degradation of reinforced concrete structures is corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Initially, the steel is protected from corrosion by the "passivation effect" of the high alkalinity of the concrete. However, in the course of time, the penetration of carbon dioxide from the air into the concrete converts the highly alkaline calcium hydroxide, present in the concrete, into non-alkaline calcium carbonate, thus diminishing the alkalinity of the concrete and the above passivation effect. In addition, the penetration into the concrete of chlorides dissolved in water also diminishes the passivation effect. With the diminishing or elimination of the passivation effect, oxygen in the presence of moisture in the air initiates corrosion of the steel reinforcement at a rate depending on the rate of supply of the oxygen.Steel pipes are commonly protected against corrosion by bonding to the pipe polyethylene or other polymeric tape wrapped around it or by forming a layer of cementitious mortar around the pipe. However, polymeric tape protection for steel pipes does not provide the above- described passivation effect to the pipe to inhibit corrosion; moreover, any imperfections in the polymeric tape 

which may be initially present, or which may appear during use, expose the pipe to corrosion in the vicinity of the imperfection. While a cementitious mortar layer applied around the pipe provides the above-described passivation effect to the pipe surface, this effect is diminished during the course of time as the cementitious layer is unprotected and therefore undergoes carbonation; moreover, the penetration of salts in a soluble form through the unprotected concrete also diminishes this effect.Another method of protecting a steel pipe is to apply a concrete layer around the
