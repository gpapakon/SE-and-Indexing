<ABSTRACT>
A drill string anchor (1) for use in a well bore, the anchor having a body (11), a through bore (12) and a plurality of anchor assemblies (13), each assembly comprising an anchor member (20), a piston (2) supported within a body and a biassing means (3). The piston is radially movable in response to fluid pressure in the through bore between a first retracted position and a second extended position in which the piston drives the anchor member into contact with the wall of the well bore. The biassing means acts to provide a force biassing the piston towards the first retracted position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anchor for use in a 
drill string. Drill strings are subjected to variations in the fluid 
pressure in the well bore. These variations in pressure can 
cause any tool mounted on the string to move axially within 
the bore, and this axial movement can affect the accurate 
operation of the tool. In particular, if a drill string 
carrying a cutting tool is caused to expand or contract by 
changes in fluid pressure, the accuracy of the cutting 
operation will be impaired. Any unscheduled axial movement 
of the tool would cause the cutters to trace a spiral path 
in the well bore. One cause of undesirable tool movement is 
pulsations in the fluid pressure within the drill string 
resulting from operation of the mud pumps. It would therefore be desirable to be able to anchor 
the drill string at a particular location to prevent axial 
movement of the tool in the well bore. Axial movement caused by well bore pressure changes is 
particularly noticeable on small diameter work strings and 
coiled tubing. In general, the smaller the diameter of the 
string, the greater the effect becomes. In order to ensure 
that a cutting tool will cut successfully and accurately it 
is clearly necessary to hold the tool against axial 
movement. Drill string anchors according to the precharacterising 
part of the main claim are known from 
US-A-2546950, US-A-2792063 and EP-A-477452. With such drill  
 
string anchors the full cross sectional area of each piston 
is permanently exposed to the fluid pressure in the through 
bore. When the fluid pressure in the through bore rises to 
a sufficient value to displace the pistons against the force 
of the respective return springs, the anchor members will be 
moved into engagement with the surrounding well casing. 
However, at pressures equal to or just above those 
sufficient to move the anchor members into engagement with 
the well casing the tool will not be able to resist 
substantial longitudinal displacement forces since the force 
with which the anchor members engage the well casing will be 
small. The anchor of the present invention has been developed 
to endeavour to prevent any axial movement of a drill string 
at the location of the anchor as fluid pressure in the drill 
string or annulus is varied. The anchor may be used with 
any other tool which requires location at a specific depth 
within a tubing or casing of a well bore. The present invention is characterised in that a drill 
string anchor for use in a well bore, the anchor

<CLAIMS>
A drill string anchor for use in a well bore, the 
anchor comprising: a body (11); a through bore (12); and a 

plurality of anchor assemblies (13), each assembly 
comprising an anchor member (21), a piston (2) supported 

within the body, and a biasing means (3), the piston being 
radially movable in response to fluid pressure in the 

through bore between a first retracted position and a second 
extended position in which the full cross-sectional area of 

the piston is exposed to the fluid pressure in the through 
bore and the piston drives the anchor member into contact 

with the wall of the well bore, and the biasing means acting 
to provide a force biasing the piston towards the first 

retracted position, characterised in that in the first 
retracted position the pistons (2) each sealingly engage a 

respective working area restricting device (15) which 
reduces the working area of each piston which is exposed to 

the fluid pressure in the through bore (12) to an area less 
than the full cross-sectional area of the piston so that the 

effective area of each piston (2) which is exposed to the 
fluid pressure in the through bore when the piston is in the 

first retracted position is smaller than the effective area 
of the piston which is exposed to the fluid pressure in the 

through bore when the piston is displaced from the first 
retracted position. 
A drill string anchor according to claim 1, wherein the 
effective piston area when the piston is in the first 

retracted position is defined by a portion of the inner face 
(14) of the piston (2) which is exposed to the fluid 

pressure in the through bore when the piston is in its first 
re
tracted position.  
 
A drill string anchor according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the outer face (21) of the piston (2) is toothed to 

constitute the anchor member.
