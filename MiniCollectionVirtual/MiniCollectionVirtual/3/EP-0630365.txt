Process for the preparation of β-phenyl-isoserine 
and its analogues of general formula: 


 
in which Ar represents an aryl radical and R represents 

a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical containing 1 to 4 
carbon atoms, which is optionally substituted by a phenyl 

radical, or a phenyl radical, characterised in that there 
is hydrogenolysed a product of general formula: 


 
in which Ar
 and R are defined as above and Ph represents 
a phenyl radical which to optionally substituted by one 

or more atoms or radicals chosen from halogen and alkoxy 
radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkylthio 

radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon aroms, amino radicals, 
alkylamino radicals containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, 

dialkylamino radicals in which each alkyl portion 
contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms or nitro radicals. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the hydrogenolysis is performed by means of hydrogen 

in the presence of a catalyst.  
 
Process according to claim 2, characterised in 
that the catalyst consists of palladium on carbon or 

palladium dihydroxide on carbon. 
Process according to one of claims 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the procedure is carried out at a 

hydrogen pressure of between 1 and 50 bars. 
Process according to one of claims 2, 3 or 4, 
characterised in that the procedure is carried out in an 

organic solvent. 
Process according to claim 5, characterised in 
that the organic solvent is acetic acid optionally 

combined with an aliphatic alcohol containing 1 to 4 
carbon atoms. 
Process according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the product of general formula (II) used is obtained 

by hydrolysis or alcoholysis of a product of general formula: 

 
in which Ar and Ph are defined as in claim 1, by means of 

an alcohol in an acidic medium, the product of general 
formula (III) being obtained by saponification or 

hydrogenolysis of a product of general formula: 

 
in which Ar and Ph are defined as in claim 1 and R
1
 
represents a group protecting the alcohol functional 

group in the form of an ester or an ether, by means of an 
inorganic base or by the hydrogen optionally generated 

in situ, in the presence of a catalyst chosen from  
 

palladium on black containing 1 to 10 % by weight of 
palladium, followed by separation of the diastereoisomers 

obtained, the product of general formula (IV) 
being obtained by cycloaddition of an imine of general 

formula: 

 
in which Ar and Ph are defined as above, onto an acid 

halide of general formula: 

 
in which R
1
 is defined as above and X represents a 
halogen atom chosen from bromine and chlorine, in the 

presence of an organic base chosen from aliphatic 
tertiary amines and pyridine. 
The product of general formula: 

 
in which Ar represents a phenyl or an α- or β-naphthyl 

radical which is optionally substituted by one or more 
atoms or radicals chosen from halogen atoms (fluorine, 

chlorine, bromine, iodine) and alkyl, aryl, aralkyl, 
alkoxy, alkylthio, aryloxy, arylthio, hydroxy, 

hydroxyalkyl, mercapto, formyl, acylamino, aroylamino, 
alkoxycarbonylamino, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, 

carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, carbamoyl, dialkylcarbamoyl, 
cyano, nitro and trifluoromethyl radicals, it being 

understood that the alkyl radicals and the alkyl portions 
of the other radicals contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms and 

that the aryl radicals are phenyl or α- or β-naphthyl  
 

radicals, Ph represents a phenyl radical which is 
optionally substituted by one or more atoms or radicals 

chosen from halogen and alkoxy radicals containing 1 to 
4 carbon atoms, alkylthio radicals containing 1 to 4 

carbon atoms, amino radicals, alkylamino radicals 
containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, dialkylamino radicals in 

which each alkyl portion contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms or 
nitro radicals and R
1
 represents an alkyl, phenylalkyl or 
phenyl radical or a R'
1
-CO radical in which R'
1
 represents 
an alkyl, phenylalkyl or phenyl radical, it being 

understood that, when Ar represents a phenyl radical, Ph 
is different from an unsubstituted phenyl radical.
