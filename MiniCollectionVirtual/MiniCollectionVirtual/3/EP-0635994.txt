<ABSTRACT>
A dispersing medium containing plural types of 
particles is let to flow in a flow path formed in a 

flow cell. The flow cell is irradiated with 
interfering light to form interference fringes of a 

pattern of stripes. In another arrangement, light is 
two-dimensionally scanned at high speed so as to cross 

a flow in the flow path. The moving particles receive 
a braking force by the light gradient force whenever 

they pass through each irradiation light stripe. In 
that case, greater braking forces act on particles 

having larger sizes (or larger refractive indices) than 
on particles having smaller sizes (or smaller 

refractive indices). Accordingly, the particles 
receiving smaller braking forces pass through the 

irradiated position more rapidly, so that particles can 
be separated to flow in the order from the particles 

receiving smaller braking forces to the particles 
receiving greater braking forces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to technology for
separating particles with light, and in particular to a method of and an apparatus for separating dispersed particles.Various methods have been known for separating
particles such as living-organism-related particles,
i.e., cells, microorganisms, liposomes, etc. and
synthetic particles, i.e., latex particles, gel
particles, industrial particles, etc.As an example, there is a report on separating
particles using so-called laser trapping, in which
particles are confined in a space by collecting and
condensing laser beams [H. Misawa, et al. Chem. Lett.,
469(1991)].The laser trapping is technology for handling
the particles, utilizing a dynamic action of light on
the particles. When a light beam having an intensity
gradient, such as a laser beam, is condensed and
irradiated onto particles, two types of forces act on
the particles, i.e., a light pressure (a radiation
pressure) acting in the irradiation direction of light
beam and a force to confine the particles in the
optical axis (i.e., a light gradient force). Either 
one of the light pressure and the light gradient force
depends on the light intensity, an intensity
distribution in the direction of the optical axis,
which is a condensing degree by a lens and the like,
and an intensity distribution in the direction
perpendicular to the optical axis. The light pressure
and the light gradient force further depend on the
refractive index, the absorption index (reflectance)
and the size of particles. Particles can be trapped at
an irradiated position by the action of the gradient
force among the two types of forces.The separation of particles using the
above-described laser trapping is conducted as follows.
Prepared is a group of particles consisting of a
mixture of two types of polystyrene latex particles
which are different in the size from each other. Laser
beams are collected and condensed in a pattern of
multiple rings by optical interference so as to impinge
upon the particles. If the diameters of the rings are
changed while keeping particles light-trapped on
associated rings, smaller particles as weakly trapped
spring out and are removed from the rings, whereby only
larger particles are continuously kept to be trapped on
the rings. As a result, the larger particles can be
selectively separated.However, the above-described method is insufficient
in the separating ability, and it is difficult to
separate, for example, three or more particle groups by
the method.The present invention has been accomplished to
