<ABSTRACT>
A apparatus for separating solid particles and a 
gas phase which contains them, which consists of a 

bent-axis duct. 
On the outermost surface of the bent portion, a 
slit is provided through which the solid products 

escape to the outside. The limited volume of the 
apparatus allows both phases to be separated with low 

residence times.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for 
separating solid particles from a gas phase which 
contains them. The present invention also relates to a process 
for separating solid particles from a solid-gas 
mixture, which uses said apparatus. The need for separating the solid particles 
contained in a gas is particularly felt in the 
production processes using fluidized bed reactors. The 
most widely known apparatuses for gas-solid separation 
are cyclones, which consist of a cylindrical chamber 
the lower portion of which is given an elongated-cone 
shape. The biphasic fluid enters the chamber at the 
high side thereof, in a tangential direction, causing 
a circular-vortex flow pattern. The considerable 
decrease in gas velocity, together with the 
centrifugal force which pushes the particles towards 
the wall, cause the segregation of said phases: i.e., 
the solid matter in the outermost portion of the 
chamber flows downwards precipitating along the bottom 
conical portions, from which it leaves to the outside; 
the gas, changing its flow direction, leaves said 
chamber from the top portion thereof, through a coaxial 
duct with the same chamber. Additionally to traditional cyclones, different 
types of apparatuses have been proposed and used. In U.S. patent No. 4,348,364; a system is 
disclosed for separating solid particles from gas-solid 
streams from TRC (Thermal Regenerative Cracking)  
 
processes. The primary separator unit is positioned at 
reactor outlet, wherein the reactant mixture displays 
high temperature, as well as high velocity values, 
which may be as high as 50 m/second. The residence times of the process gas inside the 
apparatus are short. The separation takes place by 
centrifugal projection of the solid particles towards 
a solid bed. The separator unit consists of a chamber inside 
which the gas phase and the solid phase are caused to 
change their flowing direction by 180 degrees and 90 
degrees, respectively. Inasmuch as the reactor is of 
downflow type, the gas-solid mixture enters it from 
the top side thereof. During separator operation, 
inside the chamber, on the opposite surface to the 
inlet fitting, a thick layer of solid matter is 
deposited, and protect the chamber wall from getting 
corroded. In U.S. patent No. 4,664,888 an apparatus is 
disclosed for gross catalyst-reactant gases separation 
in FCC (Fluid Catalytic Cracking) processes. The 
separator unit, installed at catalyst riser outlet, 
causes the stream flowing direction to be reversed 
downwards.

Apparatus for separating solid particles from 
a gas-solid mixture, which consists of a duct length 

with a rectangular cross-section, 
the axis of which describes a semi-circumference,wherein 

the internal (S1) and external (S2) surfaces of the 
duct are semicylindrical and concentric, and the front 

and back surfaces are flat and contoured in order to 
follow the bending of the axis of the duct, and on the 

external surface (S2), at a certain angular distance 
from the beginning of the bend of the duct, there is 

provided a slit having a suitable thickness from which 
the solid particles are obliged to leave the apparatus 

in a tangential direction relatively to the circular 
path of the gas. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said semicylindrical and concentric duct 

surfaces, have bending radiuses of R1 = 0.1 m and 
R2 = 0.14 m, respectively, of length, and the rectangular 

portion of the duct has, as its sides, Li = R2-R1 and 
Lm = 0.1 m, respectively, and the slit is at 120° from 

the beginning of the bend of the duct. 
Process for separating solid particles from a 
gas-solid mixture characterized in that said mixture 

is fed to an apparatus for separating solid particles 
from a gas-solid mixture, which consists of a duct 

length having a rectangular cross-section, the axis of 
which describes a semi-circumference, wherein the internal 

(S1) and external (S2) surfaces of the duct are 
semicylindrical and concentric, and the front and back

bending of the axis of the duct, and on the external 
surface (S2), at a certain angular distance from the 

beginning of the bend of the duct, there is provided 
a slit having a suitable thickness from which the 

solid particles are obliged to leave the apparatus in 
a tangential direction relatively to the circular path 

of the gas which, by now free from solid particles, 
leaves the appararus from the duct end.

that said semicylindrical and concentric duct 

surfaces, have bending radiuses of R1 = 0.1 m and 
R2 = 0.14 m, respectively, of length, and the rectangular 

portion of the duct has, as its sides, Li = R2-R1 and 
Lm = 0.1 m, respectively, and the slit is at 120° from 

the beginning of the bend of the duct.
