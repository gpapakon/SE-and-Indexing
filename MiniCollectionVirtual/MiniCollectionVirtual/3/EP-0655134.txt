<ABSTRACT>
A method of testing for contaminating mineral oil in a sample of synthetic ester lubricating oil from mechanical vapour recompression type heat transfer equipment which is to be retrofilled with hydrohalocarbon working fluid, comprises mixing a predetermined quantity of the synthetic ester lubricating oil with a predetermined quantity of a polar liquid or a mixture of polar liquids and determining whether the resulting mixture is clear or turbid, a clear mixture indicating that the concentration of contaminating mineral oil in the synthetic ester lubricant is below the maximum tolerable concentration and that the system can therefore be safely retrofilled with the hydrohalocarbon working fluid; and a turbid mixture indicating that the concentration of contaminating mineral oil is above the maximum tolerable concentration and that the system must therefore be reflushed with synthetic ester lubricant to further reduce the mineral oil contamination.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of testing, 
and in particular to a method of testing to be used in 
conjunction with the so-called "retrofilling" of 
mechanical vapour recompression type heat transfer 
devices. In recent years there has been increasing concern 
about the adverse effects of chlorofluorocarbons and 
hydrofluorocarbons on the content of ozone in the 
Earth's upper atmosphere and in consequence then is a 
need to replace the use of the most damaging 
halocarbons and hydrohalocarbons in refrigeration and 
air-conditioning systems with the use of more 
acceptable working fluids, in particular 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (R134a). A procedure which has been found to be 
particularly effective and successful in converting 
existing recompression type heat transfer devices to 
use 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane is the retrofill 
procedure which is described and claimed in 
EP-A-0 468 729. When the term "retrofill" is used in 
this application the term is intended to mean the 
procedure as described and claimed in EP-A-0 468 729. The synthetic ester lubricating oils which are 
particularly suited to the retrofill procedure are 
those which are described in EP-A-0 468 729. These 
esters are available commercially under the trade name 
"CASTROL ICEMATIC SW" (Trade Mark), different mixtures 
of the esters being tailored for particular refrigerant 
applications, covering a wide range of lubricant  
 
viscosities. In performing the retrofill procedure this 
usually comprises the steps of isolating the 
compressor from the remainder of the system, draining 
the mineral oil to be replaced from the compressor, 
filling the compressor with a synthetic ester 
lubricating oil, reconnecting the compressor and then 
running the system to flush the mineral oil to be 
replaced back to the compressor. The amount of 
running which is required will depend on the 
particular equipment which is to be retrofilled, e.g. 
the size and complexity of the system. After this 
running of the system the lubricating oil is tested to 
check the content of mineral oil whose presence in the 
system when the working fluid has been replaced by the 
new hydroflurocarbon would be likely to cause problems 
due to the immiscibility of mineral oils in 
1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane. The present procedure for testing of samples of 
the lubricating oil for mineral oil contamination 
involves sending the sample to a test laboratory where 
the sample is tested, usually by thin layer 
chromatography, to determine the mineral oil content 
of the

<CLAIMS>
A method of testing for contaminating 
mineral oil in a sample of synthetic ester lubricating 

oil from mechanical vapour recompression type heat 
transfer equipment which is to be retrofilled with 

hydrohalocarbon working fluid, which method comprises: 

(a) mixing a predetermined quantity of the 
synthetic ester lubricating oil contaminated with 

mineral oil with a predetermined quantity of a polar 
liquid or a mixture of polar liquids, the ester 

lubricating oil being itself completely miscible with 
the polar liquid(s) and the quantities of the ester 

lubricating oil and polar liquid(s) being so selected 
that the mixture is just saturated with the 

contaminating mineral oil when the concentration of 
the mineral oil in the synthetic ester lubricant 

corresponds to the maximum which is tolerable in the 
equipment after retrofilling with hydrohalocarbon 

working fluid; and 
(b) determining whether the resulting mixture 
is clear or turbid, a clear mixture indicating that 

the concentration of contaminating mineral oil in the 
synthetic ester lubricant is below the maximum 

tolerable concentration and that the equipment can 
therefore be safely retrofilled with the 

hydrohalocarbon working fluid; and a turbid mixture 
indicating that the concentration of contaminating 

mineral oil is above the maximum tolerable 
concentration and that the system must therefore be 

reflushed with synthetic ester lubricant to further 
reduce the mineral oil contamination. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein 
the synthetic ester lubricant is an ester or mixture 

of esters of pentaerythitol or dipentaerythitol with  
 

one or more mono or dicarboxylic acids. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
wherein the polar liquids comprise one or more organic 

liquids containing oxygen and/or nitrogen.

and water. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3, wherein the 
polar liquid comprises a mixture of acetonitrile and 

ethanol. 
A procedure for retrofilling a mechanical 
vapour recompression type heat transfer system with a

(iv) operably reconnecting the compressor to the 
remainder of the system; 
(v) running the system to flush contaminant 
mineral oil back to the compressor; 
(vi) extracting a sample of the lubricating oil 
from the compressor; and 
(vii) testing the sample of oil by the method 
of testing as claimed in any one of the preceding 

claims. 
A test kit for use in the method of testing 
as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 or the 

procedure as claimed in Claim 6, which test kit 
comprises the following components:- 


(a) a supply of the polar liquid or mixture of 
polar liquids comprising the test solution; 
(b) a measuring device for measuring an 
appropriate quantity of the test solution; 
(c) a syringe for extracting a sample of
