roller which presses a magnetic tape to the capstan axle, in which 

the capstan axle has, as an outermost layer, a diamond-like carbon 
film having a Knoop hardness of at least 5000 kg/mm², and a density 

of not larger than 3 g/cm³, which has high reliability and good 
driving performances.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a
diamond-like carbon film and a magnetic tape driving apparatus
which is used in a video tape recorder, a cassette deck, and the like.Hitherto, in a magnetic recording-reproducing apparatus
such as a video tape recorder, a cassette tape recorder, and the like,
a magnetic tape is pressed to a capstan axle by a pinch roller and
driven by the constant rotation of the capstan axle.Now, a tape driving apparatus will be explained by making
reference to Figs. 1A and 1B. The apparatus of Fig. 1 comprises a
capstan axle 21 and a pinch roller 22 which is movable in a direction
of the capstan axis and rotates with pressing a magnetic tape 23 to
the capstan axle 21.Since the pinch roller 22 presses the magnetic tape 23 to
the capstan axle 21, the magnetic tape 23 is conveyed in a rotation
direction of the capstan axle 21 according to a rotation speed of the
capstan axle 21. To prevent tape slip, a pressing force of the pinch
roller 22 to the capstan axle 21 is usually set at 1 kg or larger. By
the formation of minute unevenness on a surface of the capstan axle
21, a frictional force between the surface of the capstan axle 21 and
the magnetic tape 23 is increased and in turn a tape driving force is
increased, whereby the tape slip is suppressed. In addition, unpublished
Japanese Patent Application No. 3-209161 discloses a tape 
driving apparatus comprising a capstan axle 21 on a surface of which a diamond-like
carbon film (hereinafter referred to as "DLC film") is formed to increase the
tape driving force by utilizing frictional sliding characteristics and wear resistance
of the of the DLC film.In the article "Applications of Diamond-like Films to Electronic Components"
published by Nakaue et al. at pages 240 to 244 of "Thin Solid Films" vol. 212
(1992) May 15, Nos. 1/2 (Lausanne, Switzerland) representing the closest prior art
from which the invention proceeds it is described that DLC films show remarkable
characteristics such as high mechanical hardness, low friction and chemical
stability so that such films are very suitable as protective layers. In this article, DLC
films are examined as protective layers for metal evaporated tapes, cylinders and
capstans which are used in video tape recorders. Since the DLC film is amorphous but has the properties
similar to diamond, it is expected to find wide variety of applications
including a tribology field. As a synthesis method of the DLC
film, Japanese Patent Application No. 3-209161 discloses an ionization
vapor
