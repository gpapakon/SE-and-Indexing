<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a cutting tip for peeling or shaft turning with at least one main and secondary cutting edge. The invention consists in the fact that at least the main cutting edge (1) is arranged inclined towards the cutting tip (5) by an angle ( alpha ). The advantages achieved by the invention consist in particular in the fact that, in the case of a main cutting edge (1) and a secondary cutting edge (2), a very large effective secondary cutting edge can be realised and thus very large feed rates can be set. It should be especially emphasised that, at a given length of the cutting tip and preset ratios between main and secondary cutting edges, a total of four cutting-edge systems for example, consisting of main and secondary cutting edge, can be arranged. As a result, large secondary cutting edges are available, so that work can be carried out at large feed rates with such cutting tips while obtaining a good surface quality of the workpiece to be machined.
