of the "fly-back" type, a second switched dc/dc 

converter (CC2) of the "feed-forward" type, an H-shaped 
bridge switching circuit (HB) which is connected to the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control circuit for a
gas-discharge lamp, particularly for use in motor vehicles,
of the kind defined in the preamble of Claim 1.EP-A-0 411 617 discloses a control circuit for a discharge
lamp of this kind, comprising a lighting circuit and a
starting circuit coupled to the lamp. The lighting circuit
can be a switching circuit of the H-bridge type. The
starting circuit includes a dc/dc converter coupled to a
timing control transistor. When a power source is turned
on, said transistor maintains a glow discharge of the lamp
using power supplied from the starting circuit. Subsequently
the flow discharge is shifted to an arc discharge
by power supplied from the lighting circuit.In order to drive a gas-discharge lamp correctly during a
switching-on stage, a very high voltage of the order, for
example, of 20 Kv must be applied thereto initially in
order to start the lamp. At this stage, which is of very
short duration (of the order of a few tens of 
nanoseconds), the current through the lamp is
substantially zero.The starting stage is followed by a stage normally
called the "take-over" stage in which a fairly high
voltage, for example, of the order of 200-500 V
nevertheless has to be applied to the lamp. This
stage has a duration of the order of 0.1 milliseconds.There then follows a stage of a few seconds' duration
in which the lamp is heated (warmed up), during which a
low voltage (for example between 20 and 100 V) is
applied to the lamp, whilst a current of high intensity
(for example between 0.4 and 2.6 A) is made to flow
through the lamp.During the subsequent steady operation, the voltage
applied to the lamp is still of the order of several
tens of volts and the current also remains large, for
example, between 0.3 and 0.5 A.Control circuits for gas-discharge lamps used in motor
vehicles should conveniently have small dimensions.In some known control circuits a switched dc/dc
converter, for example, of the so-called "fly-back"
type is used and comprises a transformer, downstream of
which a rectifier circuit and an output capacitor are
connected. The primary winding of the transformer is
connected in switched mode to a direct-current voltage
source, by means of one or more electronic switches.The use of a "fly-back" dc/dc converter enables very
high voltages to be achieved for the starting and
take-over stages, irrespective of the turns ratio of 
the transformer used. The core of the transformer is
physically quite bulky, however, since its dimensions
depend (almost
