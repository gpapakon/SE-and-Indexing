<ABSTRACT>
This photodetector array has a multiplicity of photodetector elements 16, 10, 13 regularly arranged in one surface, with in each case an associated output line 18 and a differential amplifier (difference former) 20 connected to the latter. In order to obtain a space (fill) factor which is as high as possible, at least two layers A and B are provided, the photodetector elements being arranged in the first layer A which faces the light incidence and being connected to one another directly via paths 26, 23 of controllable electrical conductivity, for example channels of MOS transistors. The gate electrodes 28 of the MOS transistors are connected to a network 2 of control lines extending between the photodetector elements. All other circuit elements, in particular the differential amplifiers 20 and further required storage elements 19, are put in the second layer B which is arranged to be coplanar with respect to the first layer.
