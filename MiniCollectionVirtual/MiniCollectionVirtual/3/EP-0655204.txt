<ABSTRACT>
The dietetic products according to the invention contain water-soluble alkali metal or ammonium humates which are synthetically prepared by oxidation of polyhydric phenolic compounds and have a molecular weight of up to 50,000 Da. Preferably, the dietetic products are bakery products which contain 0.1 to 2% by weight of the humates.

<CLAIMS>
Use of synthetic water-soluble alkali metal or ammonium huminates having a 
molecular weight of up to 50 000 D produced by oxidation of multivalent 

phenolic compounds for the manufacturing of dietary products. 
Use according to claim 1 characterised in that the huminates are present in 
dissolved form. 
Use according to claim 1 characterised in that the huminates are present in 
solid form. 
Use according to claim 1 characterised in that the dietary products are beverages. 
Use according to claims 1 and 2 characterised in that the dietary products are 
raw fruits containing said huminate. 
Use according to claims 1 and 3 characterised in that the dietary products are 
baked goods. 
Process for the production of dietary products according to claim 6 
characterised in that a flour dough is formed containing 0,1 to 2 % by weight of 

said huminate and that the dough is baked by heating for a short period of time 
after shaping. 
Process according to claim 7 characterised in that baking of the shaped dough 
is effected by microwave treating for 10 to 30 seconds.
