<ABSTRACT>
An electro-optical scanning unit consisting of a linear LED array (1) and a 
linear lens array (2) for imaging slitwise onto a photoconductive drum (4) light 

emitted by the LED's.
 

A holder (14, 15) for the lens array (2) is connected by leaf springs (30, 31) to a 
holder (7) for the LED array (1).

 
The leaf springs (30, 31) connect the holders (14, 15; 7) in the middle of the arrays 

(1, 2) and at some distances therefrom and permit adjustment of the lens array (2) 
in a direction (Y-direction) perpendicular to the optical axis plane of the lens array 

(2) and in a direction (Z-direction) parallel to said optical axis plane.
 

The lens holder consists of two parts (14, 15) which are glued to the lens array (2) 
and which together form a diaphragm for the lens array (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an electro-optical scanning unit comprising a linear
array of electro-optical elements fixed on an elongate holder and a linear array of lens
units fixed to a lens holder, which lens array extends substantially parallel to the
electro-optical array,
as disclosed in WO-A-9003015.
An electro-optical scanning unit of this kind is also described in European patent
application EP-A-0575666, which is not a prior publication. In the electro-optical
scanning unit described there, connecting elements
are connected to the holders and serve to allow relative
movement of the arrays solely in their longitudinal direction. One disadvantage of
this is that to obtain a qualitatively good scanning the positional accuracy of the lens
array with respect to the array of electro-optical elements must meet high
requirements, and the same applies to the imaging place, in directions other than
their longitudinal direction, and the straightness and optical quality of the arrays. In
practice, however, linear lens arrays deviate from the straight, particularly if they are
long and have not yet been secured to a holder, and the attainable positional
accuracy of a lens array is affected by dimensional tolerances of the arrays
themselves and the elements by means of which they are interconnected. Such
tolerance deviations have a negative influence on the scanning quality.
The object of the invention is to provide an electro-optical scanning unit
without this disadvantage.
In an electro-optical scanning unit of the type described above, to this end,
according to the invention as defined in claim 1,
each connecting element is rotatable with respect to a
holder connected to one of said ends of said connecting element, about a line which
extends in the longitudinal direction of the arrays, to form a parallelogram between
the connecting elements and the holders.
Consequently, the lens array is adjustable with respect to the array of electro-optical
elements for adjustment of maximum light transmission through the lens array.
If the connecting elements are leaf springs, the leaf plane of which is situated
substantially parallel to a plane passing through the two arrays, this achieves
adjustability of the lens array without affecting the focusing thereof, in a simple but
efficient manner.In one attractive embodiment of an electro-optical scanning unit according to
the invention, the lens holder forms a slit diaphragm for the lens array. 
Consequently, when the lens array is adjusted in a direction perpendicular to
