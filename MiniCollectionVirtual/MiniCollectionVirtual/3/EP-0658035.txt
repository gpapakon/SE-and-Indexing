<ABSTRACT>
A system and method for providing subscriber selected advertising in
the form of video images to a local telephone station (16) is disclosed. The

telephone network (14) includes a telephone line system (57) and switch facility
(56,58) contained within the line system for forwarding calls made by a calling party

from a local telephone station (16) through the telephone line system to a destination
point (81). The local telephone station is interfaced with the network. The phone

includes a display monitor (18) for receiving data corresponding to video images and
displaying same. The images are stored in a central database (100) and compressed

(104) into data packets (106) of lesser bandwidth for transmission from the database
through a network interface (102) and into the existing telephone line system in

packet form to the local telephone station (16) where they are arranged and
decompressed for display on the monitor (18). A plurality of telephone stations can

be grouped into a cluster unit. In this format, video data is preferably compressed,
multiplexed, transmitted over the telephone network, demultiplexed and then

decompressed for display at respective monitors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a telephone system for
providing subscriber selected video images to a local
telephone station having a display monitor for receiving
and displaying the video images.Major providers of commercial services such as
telephone subscribers of toll-free 800 telephone services,
airline reservation services, and other similar commercial
services, spend much money catering to the world
traveller. This is especially true with telephone
subscribers of various telephone services as well as the
telephone network providers themselves. It is difficult
to advertise these services overseas. Often sales people
must travel overseas to contact foreign nationals, or
advertise directly in overseas newspapers and television
commercials. This major "sales" effort is done to "catch"
the international market, especially the world traveler.Besides the use of an international sales force, some
domestic United States telephone providers have proposed
placing their technology overseas. This is sometimes
difficult, however. Often there is a problem with a
foreign country's right-to-use such technology since it
may compete with the foreign country's national telephone
service. Also, some of the technology must be certified
and meet stringent customs duties.This void in advertising to the international world
traveler has been met to a certain degree by placing
technologically advanced telephone stations, such as the
AT&T Public Phone 2000, in airport terminals and other 
places such as hotels where these travelers tend to stay.
These phones not only provide the standard transmitter and
receiver for making local and international phone calls
but also these phones have a color monitor which displays
images such as a company logo for eight to ten seconds, or
displays information in a selected language on how to use
the phone. The Public Phone 2000 has a microprocessor
contained in the phone station which controls the color
monitor and allows other advanced telephone functions,
thus catering to the international world traveler.It would be desirable to use an existing phone having
a display monitor to play selected still or video images,
such as vendor and subscriber selected advertisements to
the world traveller. It would also be desirable to
selectively control these images depending on the location
of the phone, i.e., the terminal, the time of incoming
flights, their origin, and other factors. For example, a
local telephone station positioned at an airport terminal
may have travelers of different national origin

means (104) for compressing the data corresponding to said video images into
data packets of lesser bandwidth for transmission from said database,
decompression means (36) at said local telephone station (16) for
decompressing said compressed data corresponding to said video images,
means for displaying the video images on said display monitor,
network control means (60) in said telephone network (14) and associated
with said switch means (56) for controlling and routing the call made from the local

telephone station through said switch means, and
a call routing manager (80) located at a premises location (81) of a network
subscriber, said network subscriber being located at the premises location (81)

separate from the telephone network (14);

   wherein said call routing manager (80) is operatively connected to said
network control means (60) for determining routing logic of the call through the switch

means as a function of different calling parameters; and

   wherein said network control means (60) includes means for interacting with
the calling party and responding to a selected touch tone sequence input by the calling

party via a keypad at said local telephone station (16) for routing the call to the image database (100) and for prompting said image
