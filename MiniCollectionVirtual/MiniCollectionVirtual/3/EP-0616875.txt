<ABSTRACT>
A robot has a working arm (1) carrying a base (5) 
which itself carries supporting bars (10) and suction pads 

(11). To improve positioning of an object (20) carried by 
the robot, a rotatable connecting member (2) may be 

provided as well as a first member (3) and a second member 
(4). The second member (4) is movable in a first direction 

relatively to the first member (3) under the control of a 
first control means such as cylinder (6), and the base (5) 

is movable relatively to the second member (4) in a second 
direction substantially perpendicular to the first 

direction under the control of a second control means such 
as cylinder (8). To allow objects of different sizes, and 

misplaced objects, to be carried without wastage of 
suction, each suction pad (11) may include a valve ball 

(18) which is movable within a valve chamber (15) to close 
a main connecting hole (16), but not a smaller connecting 

hole (17), when no object (20) is present. The suction pad 
(11) may have a mouth defined by a soft member which is 

resiliently restorable to its original state after 
deformation to allow suction to be applied to uneven 

surfaces.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to carrying and
positioning robots.It is known from EP-A-0149806
(closest prior art)
for a robot to have a
working arm, or micro-manipulator to carry out large
movements, a base carried by the working arm, at least one
supporting bar carried by the base, and for hydraulic
piston and cylinder assemblies at right angles to one
another to provide a micro-manipulator between the end of
the working arm and the supporting bar. It is also known
from US-A-4778329 to provide a robot with a working arm as
the sole movement provider but to provide a sprung lost-motion
mechanism between the free end of the working arm
and the object being transported. Finally, DE-A-3923672
discloses a robot arm including suction heads which engage
an object to be lifted and which, in response to being
mechanically pressed against the object to be lifted allow
a greater degree of vacuum to be applied to the object.According to this invention, a robot comprises a
working arm, a base carried by the working arm, at least
one supporting bar carried by the base, and a plurality of
suction pads carried by the or each of the supporting bars,
wherein a first member is carried by the working arm, a
second member is carried by the first member to be movable
relatively to the first member in a first direction (X), a
first cylinder is connected between the first member and
the second member to constrain, but allow, said motion of
the second member relatively to the first member when
driven by the working arm, the base is carried by the
second member to be movable relatively to the second member
in a second direction substantially perpendicular to the
first direction, and a second cylinder is connected between
the second member and the base to constrain, but allow, 
said motion of the base relatively to the second member
when driven by the working arm;
and wherein said plurality of suction pads are
respectively provided with a valve chamber having a main
connecting hole and a smaller connecting hole, both of
which are connectible through a passageway to a source of
suction, and a valve body is inserted within the valve
chamber and is freely movable up and down to move up to
close the main connecting hole when the source of suction
is driven and to move down to open the main connecting hole
when a pad member connected to the valve chamber is covered
by an object (20).Preferably, the first member is carried by a
connecting member which is rotatably carried by the working
arm, and the first and second control means are
