<ABSTRACT>
An insert for the radial turning of grooves composed of a shank portion (2) and a cutting head (3) wherein the cutting head (3) includes an upper side composed of two inward sloping surfaces (11, 12) and two corresponding surfaces (13, 14) constituting the bottom surface as well as flank side surfaces (15, 16, 17) which extend between them. The dividing line between the upper surface and the forward flank (17) constitutes the main cutting edge (18) and the dividing lines between the upper surface and the lateral flanks constitute the side cutting edges (19, 20). The upper surface features a number of grooves (21) on each side of the inserts centre line (CL) which are separate from each other and which form a non-continuous side cutting edge (19, 20). The groove (21) is preferably V-shaped. The top side of the insert features at its forward end two protrusions (24, 25) at a distance from each other situated symmetrically on each side of the centre line (CL), the extent of which is limited by an oblique upward sloping surface and a portion of an upper planar surface. Protrusions (24, 25) are oblong in shape and are, when seen from the front surface (17) of the insert, first converging towards each other and subsequently divergent relative to each other. This geometry has resulted in an insert which is extremely well suited for the radial turning of grooves.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cutting insert for
grooving operations in accordance with claim 1. The cutting
insert is, according to the invention, particularly
suitable for different radial groove cutting and groove
turning operations as well as the profiling of grooves with
small angles, for example, the production of grooves for
piston rings.During such machining chip breaking and chip forming often
have a decisive influence on the number of interruptions in
production. Modern, high productive machines put very high
demands on good chip removal. Long, uncontrollable chips
can easily cause breakdowns in production and defective
components which have to be scrapped. Close attention must
therefore be paid to chip control and it must be allowed to
have a major influence on the design of the tool.Cutting inserts intended for the turning of grooves and
parting operations are generally clamped in holders, which
are of the blade type, in order that they can be used in
confined spaces. Such cutting inserts are, for example,
known through US-A-5,375,948 and US-A-5,423,639.US-A-4,629,372, which discloses in combination the features of
the preamble of claim 1,
teaches a metal-cutting insert for cutting-off
operations that includes transverse rake faces
positioned to the rear of the cutting edge. The cutting
edge is situated at the front end of the insert and is at
right angles to the insert's longitudinal centre line. This
insert can be used for turning grooves with a rectangular
cross section.It has been established that cutting inserts, known until
now, for the radial turning of grooves have not always
functioned satisfactorily. The chips are not broken
adequately and chip control is sub-standard.The first purpose with the present invention is
consequently to produce an insert which is well suited for
the repeated, radial turning of grooves.The second purpose with the present invention is to produce
an insert which can also be used for profiling and
longitudinal turning, in particular the profiling of the
sides of a groove with small angles.An additional purpose with the present invention is to
produce an insert which can also, in a reliable manner, 
carry out the first cut, during which a long, unbroken chip
is generally formed.These and other purposes have been achieved by developing
an insert for the turning of grooves with the features
indicated in claim 1.An embodiment of the invention is now described in more detail with
reference to the enclosed drawings in order to better
clarify but in no way
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An insert primarily for the turning of grooves in
metallic workpieces, comprising a rear shank portion (2)

and a forward cutting head (3), where the cutting head
includes an upper surface (11, 12), an underside (5) as

well as flank side surfaces (15,16,17) which extend between
these two sides and form acute angle with the upper

surface, plus that the transition line between the upper
surface and the forward flank (17) form the main cutting

edge (18)
characterized in that
 the upper surface transition line
with the lateral flank side surfaces (15,16) form side

cutting edges (19,20) and that these together extend
forward to form an acute angle (α) between them, and that a

number of grooves (21) which are separate from each other
are formed in the upper face so that the insert features a

non-continuous side cutting edge on each side of the
forward cutting head's centre line (C), the grooves(21)

extend inwards into the insert essentially at right angles
to the centre line (CL), that the width of the groove (21)

decreases in the direction inwards into the insert and that
the largest width of the groove (21) is smaller than the

distance between two adjacent grooves.
Insert according to claim 1, characteristic for this
insert is that each groove(21)) has its greatest depth in

the plane of the flank side surfaces (15, 16), and that the
depth of the grooves decreases in the direction inwards

into the insert.
Insert according to claim 1, characteristic for this
insert is that the side cutting edges (19,20) extend in

pairs towards the main cutting edge (9) forming an angle
(α) between them of 1,5-20°.
Insert according to claim 3, characteristic for this
insert is that two protrusion (24, 25) which are positioned

at a distance from each other are arranged symmetrically
relative to the centre line (CL) of the cutting head.
Insert according to claim 4, characteristic for this
insert is that it features a crooked surface (26), which

slopes downwards from the main cutting edge (18) connecting
with an upward sloping surface (27) between protrusions

(24, 25). 
Insert according to anyone of the claims 1-5,
characteristic for this insert is that the upper surface of

the cutting head is composed of V-shaped plane surfaces
(11) and (12), two of which slope obliquely downwards from

each side cutting edge and extend in the longitudinal
direction of the cutting head.
Insert according to claim 6, characteristic for this
insert is that both the downward sloping surfaces (11, 12)

vertical shoulder (10), which preferably has a half

cylindrical form.
