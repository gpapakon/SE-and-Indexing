<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a catalyst for purifying 
exhaust gases. More particularly, it relates to the catalyst 
which can efficiently purify nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the 
exhaust gases whose oxygen concentrations are at the 
stoichiometric point or more than required for oxidizing carbon 
monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons (HC) therein. As catalysts for purifying automotive exhaust gases, there 
have been employed 3-way catalysts so far which oxidize CO and 
HC and reduce NOx to purify the exhaust gases. For example, 
the 3-way catalysts have been known widely which comprise a 
heat resistant support formed of cordierite, a catalyst carrier 
layer formed of gamma-alumina and disposed on the support, and 
a noble metal catalyst ingredient selected from the group 
consisting of Pt, Pd and Rh and loaded on the catalyst carrier 
layer. The purifying performance of the 3-way catalysts for 
purifying exhaust gases depends greatly on the air-fuel ratio  
 
A/F of automotive engine. For instance, when the air-fuel 
weight ratio is larger than 14.6, i.e., when the fuel 
concentration is low (or on the fuel-lean side), the oxygen 
concentration is high in exhaust gases. Accordingly, the 
oxidation reactions purifying CO and HC are active, but the 
reduction reactions purifying NOx are inactive. On the other 
hand, when the air-fuel ratio is smaller than 14.6, i.e., when 
the fuel concentration is higher (or on the fuel-rich side), 
the oxygen concentration is low in exhaust gases. Accordingly, 
the oxidation reactions are inactive, but the reduction 
reactions are active. Moreover, when driving automobiles, especially when 
driving automobiles in urban areas, the automobiles are 
accelerated and decelerated frequently. Consequently, the air-fuel 
ratio varies frequently in the range of from the values 
adjacent to the stoichiometric point (or the theoretical air-fuel 
ratio: 14.6) to the fuel-rich side. In order to satisfy 
the low fuel consumption requirement during the driving 
conditions such as in the above-described urban areas, it is 
necessary to operate the automobiles on the fuel-lean side 
where the air-fuel mixture containing oxygen as excessive as 
possible is supplied to the engines. Hence, it has been 
desired to develop a catalyst which is capable of adequately 
purifying NOx even on the fuel-lean side (i.e., in the oxygen-rich  
 
atmospheres). In view of the aforementioned circumstances, the 
applicants et al. of the present invention proposed a novel 
catalyst in Japanese Unexamined Patent
