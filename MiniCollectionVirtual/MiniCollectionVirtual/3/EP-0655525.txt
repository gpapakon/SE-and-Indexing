<ABSTRACT>
In an ironing machine for outer clothing having sleeves, such as windcheaters, anoraks, etc., with fully automatic feeding, in which the article of clothing (7) hanging on a hanger (6) is lowered and slipped onto an ironing bust (12) which loads the article of clothing (7) with steam from the inside, it is proposed that, after possible prior lowering, the front and rear side of the article of clothing (7) is grasped from outside in each case by a gripping device (2) which causes the article of clothing (7) to open as a result of a movement directed outwards, subsequently, by lowering, irons (1) are introduced into the (opened) article of clothing (7) from the underside, are first located near to one another and, as a result of outward movement, stretch the article of clothing (7) approximately rectangularly at the bottom, so that the bust (12) can move from below into the article of clothing (7), the article of clothing (7) then moves upwards together with the bust (12), until the irons (1) are released and thereupon open to such an extent that the bust (12) and the article of clothing (7) are lowered synchronously and, after the working position is reached and the sleeves have been laid out, the loading commences.

Method of feeding an ironing machine with an outer 
garment (7) having sleeves, in which the outer garment 

(7) hanging on a hanger (6) is lowered onto an ironing 
bust (12) which supplies the outer garment (7) from the 

inside with steam, characterized in that the front side 
and the rear side of the outer garment (7) are seized 

from the outside by means of a gripping device (2) and, 
by an outwardly directed movement of the gripping 

devices (2), the outer garment (7) is opened at the 
lower side, that then the outer garment (7) is lowered 

onto bars (1) engaging into the outer garment (7) from 
below, which bars initially lie close together and then 

stretch the outer garment (7) at the bottom 
approximately rectangularly by outward movement, the 

gripping device having already released the outer 
garment, that then the bust (12) is introduced from 

below into the outer garment (7) and is moved upwards 
together with the outer garment (7) sufficiently far 

until the bars (1) are released from the outer garment 
(7) and can be withdrawn, and that then the bust (12) 

and, with it, the outer garment (7) are synchronously 
lowered and, after a working position has been reached 

and the sleeves have been laid outwards and the ends of 
the sleeves have been closed, are subjected to the 

steam. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
bars (1) with their branches form a downwardly open U-shape. 
Method according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
bars are formed by, for example, four vertical pins, 

outwardly movable in a star-shape.  
 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the gripping devices (2) are suction devices or 

needle grips or adhesive grips. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that a lower hem of the outer garment (7) is fixed 

with steam during the steaming. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterized 
in that the sleeves are moved outwards by pivoting by 

means of rotating bars bearing from the inside against 
the sleeves. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterized 
in that the upward and the downward movements of the 

bust (12) and of the outer garment (7) situated on it 
control light barriers (10, 11) or proximity switches.
