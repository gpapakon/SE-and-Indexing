<ABSTRACT>
A new device for extruding and smoothing plastic foils has an extruder (1) for extruding thermoplastic material, a sheet die (2) linked thereto and a smoothing roll mechanism (7) with at least two smoothing rolls (5, 6) which form an intermediary slit (4) for receiving the extruded web (3). In order to avoid high pressures at the slit caused by variations in the thickness of the extruded web, at least one roll (6) of the smoothing mechanism is elastically movable perpendicularly to the contact plane between the two rollers, thus modifying the distance (A) between the axes of the two rolls.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for extruding and smoothing of plastic films
consisting of


A) an extruder (1) to extrude thermoplastic materials,
B) a film die (2) connected thereto,
C) a smoothing roll mechanism (7) comprising at least two
smoothing rolls (5, 6) forming an intermediary slit (4)

to receive an extruded film web (3),

   characterized in that

at least roll (6) of smoothing mechanism (7) is arranged in
an elastic and movable way perpendicularly to the contact

plane of the intermediary slit, thus modifying the distance
A between the axes of the two rolls.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
pressure at the slit varies within a range of ± 20 % being

independent on the axle shifting.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
slit pressure is adjusted to an almost constant size.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
slit pressure P1 in relation to the slit length does not

exceed 100 N/cm.
Apparatus according to any one of the above Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the pressure at the slit is

adjustable.
