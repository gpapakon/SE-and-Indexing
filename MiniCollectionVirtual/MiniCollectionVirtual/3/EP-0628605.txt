<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silicone
composition which can be cured by both curing mechanisms of
a moisture- or anaerobic-curing mechanism and a photocuring
mechanism.Silicone affords a soft cured material rich in
elasticity and having high impact resistance, vibration
resistance and thermal stress resistance, and thus it is a
substance of high industrial utility value. However, since
the conventional one-pack type silicone requires a
considerable time for complete curing because it undergoes a
condensation reaction in the presence of moisture and cures.
To avoid this inconvenience, a silicone which cures upon
exposure to light has recently been developed. For example,
a silanol terminated organopolysiloxane is treated with an
aminoalkoxysilane to replace the end with an amino group, and glycidyl (meth)acrylate
is added thereto, to render the siloxane photocurable (see JP55-112262A). However,
since the glycidyl group exhibits low reactivity to the amino group it is necessary
to conduct the reaction at a high temperature with heating for a long time or the
reaction has to be carried out in the presence of catalysts. As to the addition
reaction of glycidyl (meth)acrylate, since the epoxy group and the acryl group 
are similar in reactivity to each other, the acryl group
will undergo a Michael addition reaction, resulting in
photocurability being sometimes not imparted to the
siloxane.In JP61-145227A, a silicone oil of amino chain and
a vinyl group-containing isocyanate are reacted with each
other, but the cured material obtained is very hard because
of a side chain type and thus is unsuitable for potting or
bonding although it is superior for coating or the like.Further, in the reaction of a vinyl group-containing
isocyanate with an amino group terminated
silicone oil, if the amino group is a primary amino group, a
urea bond results, so that the proportion of hydrogen bonds
increases and the viscosity becomes very high, thus making
it very difficult to handle the reaction product.An anaerobic-curable silicone is also known.
Generally, while in contact with air or oxygen, this
silicone does not cure and is stable over a long period of
time, but when air or oxygen is shut off, for example,
between two adjacent faces, it polymerizes and cures, so is
used for bonding, sealing or fixing metallic parts and the
like.Heretofore, as anaerobic-curable compositions of
this sort, there have been known compositions each
comprising a monomer consisting principally of an acrylic 
ester monomer and/or a
