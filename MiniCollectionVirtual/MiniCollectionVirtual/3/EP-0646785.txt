<ABSTRACT>
In order to measure the water content of a fluid, in particular of oil in oil baths of thermal treatment systems, a partial flow of the fluid is fed through a measuring cell (2) in the form of a metallic waveguide, whilst microwaves are injected into the waveguide and extracted. The microwaves are fed through the waveguide. The signal received by a detector (10) constitutes a measure of the attenuation. In an evaluation and control unit (11), the analogue signal is digitised in a manner which is known per se and can be displayed.
