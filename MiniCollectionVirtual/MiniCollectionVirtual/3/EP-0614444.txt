<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to new compositions of matter having the formula AnCx, wherein A is a monovalent cation and Cx is a fullerene anion, preferably wherein x is equal to 60 and 70. The present invention also relates to a process for preparing the composition by applying an electrical potential to a non-aqueous solution of a fullerene and a salt containing a monovalent cation. The present invention also relates to a method for electrochemically generating fulleride salts as a solution in other hydrocarbons. The present invention also relates to a method for electrochemically preparing solid fulleride salts. The compositions may be used as electrode material in reversible electrochemical cells, superconductors, spin labels, magnetic thermometers, organic, and polymer precursors.

 NOVEL SALTS OF FULLERENESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to novel salts of fullerenes, also known as fulleride salts, their preparation and use.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONDiamond and graphite are two well known allotropic forms of carbon. Another form, the fullerenes, have been prepared by graphite volatilization (See W. Kratschmer et al , Nature, 347, p. 354 (1990)). Potassium and other metal complexes of fullerenes have been observed in the gas phase by mass spectrometry (See D. M. Cox et al , J. Chem. Phvs. 88(3), 1588 (1988)).Fullerenes are hollow molecules composed only of carbon atoms and constitute a new allotropic form of carbon. Typically, fullerenes each have carbon atoms arranged as 12 pentagons, but differing numbers of hexagons having the formula C2n where n is equal to or greater than 16 (hereinafter "fullerenes"). The pentagons are required in order to allow the curvature and eventual closure of the closed surface upon itself. The most abundant species of fullerenes identified to date is the C60 molecule or Buck insterfullerene (here¬ inafter "C6θ"). C60 consists of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. However, other species, including C70 have also been identified.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThe portion of this invention that relates to Cβo fulleride salts was first disclosed by applicants at a seminar in Boston, Massachusetts on November 29, 1990, and subsequently published in Mat. Res. Soc. Svmp. Proc. Vol. 206, p. 659 (1991). This invention provides new compositions of matter having the formula AnCx, wherein Cx is a fullerene anion wherein x is preferably selected from the group consisting of C60 and C70 and wherein A is a monovalent cation. 

 Preferred monovalent cations, in accordance with the present inven¬ tion, include ammonium cations, alkyl ammonium cations such as quater¬ nary ammonium cations, alkali metal cations, phosphonium and arsoniu cations, especially organophosphonium and organoarsonium ions, partic¬ ularly phenylphosphonium and phenylarsonium cations. The preferred fullerene used in the practice of the present invention is C60-In one embodiment of the present invention, the fulleride salt compounds of the present invention are prepared by passing an electric current through (electrolyzing) a non-aqueous solution of fullerenes in the presence of a soluble salt containing a cation, A, of the AnCχ compound to be formed. The electric potential is applied for a time sufficient to generate fullerene anions in the solution. In another embodiment of the present
