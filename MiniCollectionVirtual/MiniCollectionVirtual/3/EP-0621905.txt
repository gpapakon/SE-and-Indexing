<ABSTRACT>
The present invention concerns a new process and the relative plant for reducing hexavalent chromium contained in the resultant earth after the production of chromium, in order to obtain the transformation from water-soluble compounds into insoluble compounds, the process comprising the phases of mixing the said residual products with one or more reducing agents and of indirectly heating the said mixture substantially without the presence of oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "PROCESS AND PLANT FOR THE REDUCTION OF HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM CONTAINED IN THE RESIDUE RESULTING FROM THE PROCESSING OF CHROMIUM MINERALS"The present invention concerns a new reduction process for hexavalent chromium contained in the earth resulting from the production of chromium, in order to obtain the transformation from water-soluble compounds into insoluble compounds.5. The invention also concerns a plant for carrying out the above-mentioned process.It is well known that in the process of extracting hexavalent chromium by roasting chromite and its subsequent leaching, it is not possible to recover all the hexavalent chromium in order to produce alkaline 10. chromate.In fact, after leaching, a solid material is obtained which is commonly called "leaching residue" or "resultant earth", which still contains variable quantities of hexavalent chromium.There are three very different cases connected with the result of 15. leaching.In brief, since the technology of chromium extraction is known to the technicians in the art, these three cases may be summarized as follows:A) Mixtures with a high content of lime (or dolomite). 20. B) Mixtures with a low content of lime (or dolomite). C) Mixtures without lime (or dolomite).The problem of eliminating the hexavalent chromium which is soluble in 

 water is easy to solve for processings which do not include lime, since the relative residual products do not contain partially soluble chromium compounds owing to the complexes formed between calcium salts and hexavalent chromium.5. In this case, it is sufficient to add to the residual products a normal reducing agent, such as ferrous sulphate, ferrous chloride etc. , which reduce the chromium from CrO to Cr 0 , which is3 23 insoluble.For processings which contain calcium, there is still the formation of 10. compounds containing hexavalent chromium in a form which is difficult to dissolve in a short time, such as calcium chromate, for example.These derivates, therefore, cannot be leached immediately during normal processing and remain in the resultant earth. However, as time goes by, if the earth is subject to wash-out, by the action of rain 15. water, for example, the hexavalent chromium is leached and released.Hence, it is evident how these solid residual products from the processing of chromium minerals create serious problems, as they are classified and treated as harmful toxic waste and not easy to dispose in suitably equipped dumps.20. It should also be borne in mind that the quantity of these residual products
