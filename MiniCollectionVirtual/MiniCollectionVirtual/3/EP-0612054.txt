<ABSTRACT>
A method for making invisible identification markings on 
electronic images, e.g. for proving ownership, involves 

inserting identical colour values into at least two entries 
in a colour palette. An area of the image is modified to 

include a pattern composed of two or more pixel values which 
index entries in the colour palette containing identical 

colour values. Thus, the area is displayed on the screen as 
an area of single colour, and the pattern is invisible. 

However, the pattern can be detected electronically, or can 
be made visible by modifying the pallette entries..

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to storage and display of electronic 
images, such as for example graphical, pictorial or 
photographic images held in electronic form for display on 
(eg) a computer screen. An object of the invention is to provide a method of making 
invisible identification markings on such images. These 
markings could be used for any purpose, such as for example 
to identify versions of images. It is envisaged that one 
important usage could be to prove ownership of an image 
should any dispute arise over copyright or other rights in 
that image. According to the invention there is provided an image display 
system comprising: 
a) a display memory for storing an image as an array of 
pixel values; b) a colour palette for holding a table of colour values; 
and c) means for reading a pixel value from the display memory 
and using it to index the colour palette, to read out a 
colour value for display on a screen;  d) characterised in that at least two of the entries in the 
colour palette contain identical colour values; and  e) the image stored in the display memory contains at least 
one area containing a pattern composed of pixel values 
which index said entries containing identical colour 
values, whereby the area is displayed on the screen as 
an area of single colour. It can be seen that the invention provides a way of storing 
markings in the image itself rather than as ancillary 
information in the file containing that image. As a result, 
the markings will be propagated not only when the file is 
copied but also if the information is converted to other file 
formats, or if the image is "captured" by a computer program 
which attempts to copy images by reading the image details 
directly from the computer's display hardware or display 
memory whilst the image is being displayed. The markings are invisible in the sense that they cannot be 
detected when the image is displayed in the normal manner on 
(eg) a computer screen. However, a computer program 
cognisant of the method for encoding these markings can 
display the markings when required. The drawing is a block diagram of a computer system including 
a display system. One display system in accordance with the invention will now 
be described by way of example with reference to the 
accompanying drawings.  Referring to Figure 1, the system comprises a display memory 
10 which stores an image as a rectangular array of pixel 
values, each value corresponding to the colour of a 
particular point of the image. For example, a typical full
