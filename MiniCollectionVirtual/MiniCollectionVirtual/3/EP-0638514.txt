<ABSTRACT>
The tube furnace has numerous catalyst-containing tubes located in a fire space. Synthesis gas containing primarily hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is generated in the tubes. At the outsides of the discharge ends of the tubes, there is the danger of carbide formation (metal dusting corrosion). To prevent this, a largely CO-free, gaseous or vapour-form protective medium is supplied to the exterior region of the discharge ends of the tubes.

<CLAIMS>
A tubular furnace for the catalytic cracking of 
hydrocarbons for producing crude synthesis gas 

containing above all hydrogen, carbon monoxide and 
carbon dioxide, in which the furnace has a plurality of 

catalyst-containing tubes which are located in a 
combustion chamber, characterised in that at least some 

of the tubes in the outer region of their mouth end 
which is located outside the combustion chamber and 

through which the crude synthesis gas flows have a 
means for supplying a largely CO-free, gaseous or 

vaporous protective medium. 
A tubular furnace according to Claim 1, 
characterised in that the outside of the mouth end of 

at least some tubes has a chamber for introducing 
protective medium. 
A tubular furnace according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that the mouth end of at least some 

tubes has a refractory lining. 
A tubular furnace according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the protective medium is 

brought in through a line which extends over a certain 
distance immediately along the outside of the 

associated tube carrying synthesis gas.
