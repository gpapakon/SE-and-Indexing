<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides an imaging element comprising on the 
same side of a support in the order given a base layer, a light 

sensitive layer containing a silver halide emulsion and a surface 
layer comprising physical development nuclei characterized in that 

said base layer and/or said light-sensitive layer comprises gelatin 
being hardened with a divinylsulfonyl hardener such that the time 

needed to completely brake down said base layer, light sensitive 
layer and surface layer using an aqueous solution of 0.14% by weight 

of NaOCl at 25°C is between 1000s and 1600s. A lithographic 
printing plate can be obtained with such imaging element according 

to the silver salt diffusion transfer process and exhibits an 
improved printing endurance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for manufacturing a
lithographic printing plate precursor and to a method for producing
a lithographic printing plate therewith.The principles of the silver complex diffusion transfer reversal
process, hereinafter called DTR-process, have been described e.g. in
US-P 2,352,014 and in the book "Photographic Silver Halide Diffusion
Processes" by André Rott and Edith Weyde - The Focal Press - London
and New York, (1972).In the DTR-process non-developed silver halide of an
information-wise exposed photographic silver halide emulsion layer
material is transformed with a so-called silver halide solvent into
soluble silver complex compounds which are allowed to diffuse into
an image-receiving element and are reduced therein with a developing
agent, generally in the presence of physical development nuclei, to
form a silver image having reversed image density values
("DTR-image") with respect to the black silver image obtained in the
exposed areas of the photographic material.A DTR-image bearing material can be used as a planographic
printing plate wherein the DTR-silver image areas form the
water-repellant ink-receptive areas on a water-receptive
ink-repellant background. The DTR-image can be formed in the
image-receiving layer of a sheet or web material which is a separate
element with respect to the photographic silver halide emulsion
material (a so-called two-sheet DTR element) or in the
image-receiving layer of a so-called single-support-element, also
called mono-sheet element, which contains at least one photographic
silver halide emulsion layer integral with an image-receiving layer
in waterpermeable relationship therewith. It is the latter
mono-sheet version which is preferred for the preparation of offset
printing plates by the DTR method. For example the United Kingdom
Patent Specification 1,241,661 discloses a method for the production
of a planographic printing plate consisting of a sheet material
comprising an outer hydrophilic colloid layer on the surface of
which there is concentrated a silver image stemming from an 
underlying exposed silver halide emulsion layer by the silver
complex diffusion transfer reversal process. The silver image
formed on the surface is suitable for printing images in a
lithographic printing process using a dampening liquid.Commercial lithographic printing plate precursors of the latter
type typically contain on a support in the order given a base layer
serving as an anti-halation layer, a silver halide emulsion layer
and a
