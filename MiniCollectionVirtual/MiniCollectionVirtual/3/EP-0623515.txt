<ABSTRACT>
A device for handling objects during transport, especially through filling and/or packaging plants, works with carrier elements (14a, b) which have a plane standing surface (17) and which are matched to the shape and/or nature of the objects. The objects are received temporarily in these carrier elements. The arrangement is such that, as seen in the direction of transport, the carrier elements are provided on both sides with mutually parallel surface regions (20), and that, for selective conveyance, they are arranged on different transport means.
