A die for drawing wire of a predetermined diameter 
comprising an optically non-opaque CVD diamond body having a 

thermal conductivity greater than 4 watts/ cm-K with an opening (12) 
extending through said body and having a wire bearing portion (17) of 

substantially circular cross-section determinative of the diameter of 
the wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to diamond wire dies.Wires of metals such as tungsten, copper, iron, molybdenum,
and stainless steel are produced by drawing the metals through
diamond dies. Single crystal diamond dies are difficult to fabricate,
tend to chip easily, easily cleave, and often fail catastrophically
because of the extreme pressures involved during wire drawing.With reference to single crystal wire dies, it is reported in
Properties and Applications of Diamond, Wilks et al, Butterworth-Heinemann
Ltd 1991, pages 505-507: "The best choice of
[crystallographic] direction is not too obvious because as the wire
passes through the die its circumference is abrading the diamond on
a whole 360° range of planes, and the rates of wear on these planes
will be somewhat different. Hence, the originally circular hole will
not only grow larger but will loose its shape. However, 〈110〉
directions offer the advantage that the wire is abrading the sides of
the hole with {001} and {011} orientations in abrasion resistant
directions."Diamond dies which avoid some of the problems attendant
with natural diamonds of poorer quality comprise microporous
masses compacted from tiny crystals of natural or synthesized
diamonds or from crystals of diamond. The deficiencies of such
polycrystalline hard masses, as indicated in U.S. patent 4,016,736, are
due to the presence of micro-voids/pores and soft inclusions. These
voids and inclusions can be more than 10 microns in diameter. The
improvement of the patent utilizes a metal cemented carbide jacket 
as a source of flowable metal which fills the voids resulting in an
improved wire die.European Patent Application 0 494 799 A1 describes a
polycrystalline CVD diamond layer having a hole formed
therethrough and mounted in a support. As set forth in column 2,
lines 26-30, "The relatively random distribution of crystal
orientations in the CVD diamond ensures more even wear during
use of the insert." As set forth in column 3, lines 50-54, "The
orientation of the diamond in the polycrystalline CVD diamond
layer 10 may be such that most of the crystallites have a (111)
crystallographic axis in the plane, i.e. parallel to the surfaces 14, 16,
of the layer 10.Other crystal orientations for CVD films are known. U.S.
patent 5,110,579 to Anthony et al describes a transparent
polycrystalline diamond film as illustrated in Figure 3A,
substantially transparent columns of diamond crystals having a
〈110〉 orientation perpendicular to the base.Because of its high purity and uniform consistency,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A die for drawing wire comprising:-

(a) a substantially transparent polycrystalline CVD diamond body having a thermal
conductivity greater than 4 watts/cm-K and a uniform small diamond grain structure

of less than about 5 microns throughout its cross section and an opening
extending through said diamond body and having a wire bearing portion of

substantially circular cross section
for receiving

wire fed through said opening during drawing, and
(b) a support body for supporting the diamond body, whereby the wear resistance of
said die is substantially increased.
The die according to claim 1, wherein said body comprises diamond crystals
having a 〈110〉 orientation perpendicular to a base surface of the diamond body.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 1 having a thermal conductivity
of at least about 6 W/cm-K.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 3 having a thermal conductivity
of at least about 9 W/cm-K.
A die for drawing wire in accordance with claim 4 having a thermal conductivity
about 21 W/cm-K.
