<ABSTRACT>
A Salmonella gene, encoding a cytolysin, has been identified by screening for hemolysis on blood agar. The gene (slyA) is present in every strain of Salmonella examined in Shigella, and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) but not in other enterobacteriaceae. It is encoded near 28.5 minutes on the chromosome. A SlyA (salmolysin) has hemolytic and cytolytic activity and has a molecular weight predicted by the DNA sequence.

<DESCRIPTION>
Many Gram negative and Gram positive pathogenic
microorganisms produce toxins or hemolysins that can lyse eukaryotic
cells and contribute to their pathogenicity. S.A. Mims (1982), The
Pathogenesis of Infectious Disease (Academic Press). The most
intensively studied exotoxin produced by Gram negative pathogens are
members of the RTX family and are reviewed in A. Ludwig and W. Goebel
(1991), Genetic determinants of cytolytic toxins from gram-negative
bacteria; in J.E. Alouf and J.H. Freev (eds.), Sourcebook of bacterial
proteins, pp. 117-146, Academic Press, London; and in R.A. Welch (1991),
Mol. Micro.5, 521-528, and V. Braun et al. (1991), Critical Reviews in
Microbiology18, 115-158. The HlyA hemolysin present in strains of
uropathogenic E. Coli is the best studied of these. HlyA increases E. Coli
virulence in a rodent model of peritonitis. R.A. Welch et al. (1981), Nature294, 665-667. Although the precise mechanism by which this occurs is
unclear, it is suggested that these toxins are involved in attenuating host
phagocytic cell function. Welch et al., supra; S. Bhakdi et al. (1986),
Infect. Immun. 52, 63-69; S. Bhakdi et al. (1990), J. Clin. Inv. 85, 1746-1753;
S.J. Cavalleri et al. (1984), Infect. Immun. 37, 966-974; and B. Konig
et al. (1986), Infect. Immun. 54, 886-892. Several facultative intracellular
pathogens, including rickettsiae, shigellae, Trypanosoma cruzi, and
Listeria monocytogenes share a common trait, i.e., to allow escape from
the phagocytic vesicle of professional phagocytic cells. J.W. Moulder
(1991), Micro. Rev.55, 143-190; J. Turco et al. (1991), Infect. Immun.59,
1647-1655; B.B. Finlay et al. (1989), Micro. Rev.53, 210-230; and N.W.
Andrews et al. (1990), Cell.61, 1277-1287. A defined role in virulence is
difficult to assign to most toxins, in part because of the lack of convenient
animal models for many organisms. One exception is the listeriolysin
made by Listeria monocytogenes. The toxin dissolves the phagocytic
membrane, allowing the bacteria to escape into the cytoplasm; hemolysin
negative mutants are avirulent. J.L. Gaillard et al. (1987), Infect. Immun.
55, 1641-1646; S. Kathariou et al. (1987), J. Bact. 169, 1291-1297; and D.
Portnoy et al. (1989), Infect. Immun. 57, 477-486. The infected cell 
remains intact, and the bacteria are protected from the immune defenses
of the host. C.M. Hage-Chahine et al. (1992), Infect. Immun. 60, 1415-1421.
Transfer of the gene-encoding listeriolysin to the non-pathogenic
bacterium Bacillus subtilis allows it to also escape the phagosome,
