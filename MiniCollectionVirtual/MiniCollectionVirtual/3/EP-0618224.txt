<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to dipeptides and 
analogs thereof having a phosphonomethyl moiety, 
pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, 
processes for making such compounds, intermediates used in 
these processes, and methods for inhibiting the production 
of Endothelin. These compounds inhibit Endothelin 
Converting Enzyme and are thus useful in treating 
conditions responsive to inhibition of production of 
Endothelin. The peptide Big Endothelin, found in endothelium cells, 
is cleaved by the enzyme Endothelin Converting Enzyme (ECE) 
to produce the peptide Endothelin. Endothelin is a 21 amino 
acid vasoconstrictor and is produced by endothelium cells, 
mesangial, kidney and epithelial cells and by various human 
cancer cell lines and human macrophages. Biologically, endothelin has effects on vascular smooth 
muscle, nonvascular smooth muscle, heart, nervous tissue, 
kidney and adrenal glands. Endothelin constricts arteries 
and veins, increases mean arterial blood pressure, 
decreases cardiac output, increases cardiac contractility in 
vitro, stimulates mitogenesis in vascular smooth muscle cells  in vitro, contracts vascular smooth muscle including guinea 
pig trachea, human urinary bladder strips and rat uterus in 
vitro, increases airway resistance in vivo, induces formation 
of gastric ulcers, stimulates release of atrial natriuretic 
factor in vitro and in vivo, increases plasma levels of 
vasopressin, aldosterone and catecholamines, inhibits 
release of renin in vitro and stimulates release of 
gonadrotropin in vitro. See, for example, PCT patent 
application publication number WO 92/13545. Possible indications for use of inhibitors of 
production of endothelin include treatment of 
cardiovascular diseases (e.g., myocardial ischemia, 
congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, unstable angina and 
hypertension); bronchoconstriction (pulmonary hypertension 
and asthma); neuronal action disorders (cerebral vasospasm 
and subarachnoid hemorrhage); endocrine disorders (preeclampsia); 
renal disease (acute/chronic renal failure); 
vascular disorders (atherosclerosis, Buergers disease, 
Takayasu's arteritis, Raynaud's phenomenon and 
complications in diabetes); cancer (especially pulmonary 
carcinoma; gastric mucosal damage (gastrointestinal 
disorders); and endotoxic shock and septicemia. See J.Med. 
Chem. 35(9): 1493-1508 (1992); Neurology 42: 25-31 (1992); 
and Drug Development Research 26: 361-387 (1992).  The present invention relates to a compound having the
