<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a differential gear that, 
when a rotational difference occurs 

on a pair of output-side rotary bodies (17) arranged in opposite 
form to each other on the shaft center of an input-side 

rotary body (1), a differential rotation of each output-side 
rotary body is achieved by interconnecting the rotary motion 

of each output-side rotary body by means of numerous grooves (10a) 
and numerous balls (6) fitted to these grooves. At this time, 

when the force necessary to cause a rotational difference is 
given to each output-side rotary body only from one output-side 

rotary body, the balls or grooves of the driven side at 
differential rotation cause the grooves or balls of the 

driving side to follow their own motion on the other output-side 
rotary body. Consequently, the reaction force caused 

at this time acts as a resistance to limit the differential 
rotation of each output-side rotary body. Accordingly, this 

invention permits a very stable differential limitation 
effect of torque sensitizing type to be obtained without 

requiring any special mechanism for this purpose.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a differential gear that 
allows a rotational difference between the left-hand and 
right-hand driving wheels or between the front and rear 
driving wheels of a vehicle. In the past, the differential gear used for the driving 
force transmission system of vehicles has been a system that 
allows a rotational difference between the left-hand and 
right-hand driving wheels when a vehicle travels on curves 
or the rotational difference between the front and rear 
driving wheels of a four-wheel drive vehicle.
 
However, when only one driving wheel runs on a surface with 
an extremely low coefficient of friction such as snow or 
sand, this wheel races and the whole driving force is lost 
with the result that the vehicle cannot escape from such a 
surface.
 
If the load on the inner wheel is substantially reduced by  
 
centrifugal force when the vehicle travels on a curve at 
high speed, the driving force to negotiate the curve at high 
speed is easily lost. To make up for such a drawback, some 
vehicles are provided with a differential limitation 
mechanism, for example, of a clutch disk crimping type, 
thereby limiting the differential rotation of each driving 
wheel under a specified condition. However, this type 
indicates a sudden differential limitation effect with the 
increase of rotational difference and mutually binds 
individual wheels even at non-driving when no driving force 
is input from the engine side. This makes it difficult to 
combine with a system in which independency is required for 
the rotation of each wheel as seen in the antilock brake 
system. For this reason, a differential limitation mechanism of 
rotation speed sensitizing type using a viscous coupling is 
often used of late to maintain independency for the rotation 
of each driving wheel limiting the differential rotation 
under a specified condition at driving.
 
The viscous coupling is a type of viscous clutch which 
transmits torque by means of the shear resistance of a 
viscous fluid (e.g., silicone oil), so a smooth differential 
limitation effect can be obtained in accordance with each 
rotational difference.  As a differential gear having a mechanism to limit the 
differential rotation only at driving without limiting each 
driving wheel at non-driving, for example, a torque 
sensitizing type combined with a worm gear has already been 
made known as described in Provisional Publication 
No.271926/92 of Japanese Patent Application Official 
Gazette.
 
In this type, a pair of screw-shaped worms
