<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dihydropyran derivatives and 
their use. 3,3',4,4'-tetrahydro-6,6'-bis-2H-pyran (abbreviated 
herein as "bis-DHP") is known. It selectively protects 
1,2-diols, to form dispiroketals, and this protection is 
useful for carbohydrates; see Ley etal, Tet. Lett. (1992) 
33: 4767-70, and Synthesis (1992) 52-54. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
novel compounds are ring-substituted derivatives of bis-DHP, 
having C2 symmetry, in single enantiomer form. The 
formula (1) of 2,2'-disubstituted such compounds is shown 
in Scheme 1, and 5,5'-disubstituted compounds are shown by 
formula (1A). They are useful for the resolution of chiral 
1,2-diols or related 1,2-difunctional compounds or for the 
desymmetrisation of prochiral 1,2-difunctional compounds, 
e.g. glycerol, or as catalysts. In particular, a novel compound (1) may be reacted 
enantioselectively with a compound (2) to give a 
dispiroketal (3); see Scheme 1. The dispiroketals are 
themselves new. According to a further aspect of the 
invention, the dispiroketals may be used as a chiral 
template, or separated from a non-reacting enantiomer of 
racemic (2), and the bis-DHP unit may then be removed. The present invention is based on the discovery that, 
when the bis-DHP contains substituents R, e.g. in the 2 and 
2' positions, and the compounds are in substantially single 
enantiomeric form, they are highly selective in protecting 
diol functions of a specific chirality. Thus, treatment of 
compound (1) with a difunctional compound of formula 
R'-CH(XH)-CH(YH)-R'' (2) will give specifically a 
dispiroketal of formula (3) (Scheme 1).  In the case of a compound (1) where R=Me, a synthesis 
is outlined as Scheme 2. The 2S,2S'-product is shown, but 
this process can be adapted for the preparation of any 
2,2'- or other disubstituted-bis-DHP compound of the 
invention. Examples of 2,2'-substituents R on the bis-DHP molcule 
are C₁₋₆ alkyl or C₆₋₁₀ aryl, e.g. methyl or phenyl or, more 
generally, higher alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, etc. The nature 
of R is not critical, e.g. of up to 20 C atoms, but it is 
preferably inert. There may be other ring-substituents, 
provided that C2 symmetry and enantioselectivity to 1,2-difunctional 
compound (2) are retained. Thus R may be as 
shown in formula (1A), and these groups may be alternative 
or additional to 2,2'-substituents. The substituents shown 
in formula (1A) may have a function other than directing 
enantioselective reaction, however; such compounds may have 
utility,
