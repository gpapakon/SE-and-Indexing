in quantizing the previous values will be taken in account in the 
search of the optimum quantization levels of the next values.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for speech coding
as set forth in the preamble of claim 1 and a speech coder as
set forth in the preamble of claim 19.In the telecommunication field it is useful to transmit the
information both vocal and video using as less numbers of
bits as possible without loosing part of the information
transmitted.Such aim is achieved by means of suitable coding techniques.
There are a lot of these techniques: each of them has its
characteristic features. From the field of the communication
theory, and in particular from the modulation theory the
Trellis Coded Modulation technique is well known. The Trellis
Coded Modulation paradigm, combined with well-known
quantization theories, gave rise to the Trellis Coded
Quantization (TCQ) algorithm.From US patent no. 4, 975, 956 a speech coder is known that
employs vector quantization of LPC parameters after
conversion from RC to LSP. The gain and pitch are encoded
using an adaptive tracking technique with a form of trellis
coding. Said form of trellis coding, however, involves a too
high computational load, since the generated sequences are
compared to find the minimum distortion.TCQ is a recent technique for efficient scalar encoding of
any source.In particular, it has been introduced by M.W. Marcellin, T.G:
Fisher, in "Trellis Coded Quantization of memoryless and
Gauss-Markov Sources", IEEE Trans. on Communication, vol. 38,
No. 1, January 1990, for encoding memoryless Gauss-Markov
sources. The feature of the trellis coded quantization
approach is the use of a structured codebook with an expanded
set of quantization levels. Based on the notion of set
partitioning introduced by G: Ungerboek, in "Channel Coding
with Multilevel/Phase Signals", IEEE Trans. on Information
Theory, 
Vol. IT-28, Jan. 1982, the trellis structure then prunes the
expanded number of quantization levels down to the desired
encoding rate. The encoder uses the Viterbi algorithm for finding
a vector of quantized scalars that is closest (according to a
predetermined metric) to the unquantized vector.Because of the complexity of the matter, only a good knowledge of
both the modulation theory (TCM) and of the quantization theory
allows a proper implementation and exploitation of this quantization
technique.The main object of the present invention is therefore substantially
an efficient and effective way how to apply the TCQ technique.According to the invention, therefore, the method for speech coding
is constructed as set forth in claims 1 or 18 and the speech
