<ABSTRACT>
In rhinostereometric measurement, the positions in a fixed coordinate system are determined for a number of points on the nasal mucosa of a test subject. To obtain comparable results on different measuring occasions, the head of the test subject must occupy the same position in the coordinate system every time. By determining the position of the test subject's face in the coordinate system on every occasion of rhinostereometric measurement and transposing the measuring position of the face in the coordinate system to a reference position, the values of the points in the nose can be corrected for the displacement of the face from the reference position that has taken place since the latest measurement, thereby to obtain comparable results that are always related to the reference position. Preferably, the position of the face in the coordinate system is determined by measuring the distance between fixed locations in the coordinate system and points in the test subject's face with the aid of distance-measuring lasers (8-12) mounted on a fixed frame (3) in the coordinate system. The displacement of the test subject's head is minimised by a mechanical fixing means (5) in the form of a spectacle frame. The measured values are processed in a computer (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND DEVICE FOR RHINOSTEREOMETRIC MEASUREMENT This invention relates to a method for rhinostereo¬ metric measurement as well as a device for implementing the method, comprising optical equipment for determining the coordinates of one or more points on a person's nasal mucosa.Rhinostereometry is a known optical method used for measuring the congestion of the nasal mucosa. The head of the person to be subjected to such measuring is fixed in a coordinate system. The positions in the coordinate sys¬ tem of a number of points on the nasal mucosa are then determined with the aid of a surgical microscope placed on a micrometer table so as to be movable in all three dimen- sions. Rhinostereometry is described in more detail in a doctoral thesis by Jan-Erik Juto: Rhinostereometry, Stock¬ holm, 1985, ISBN-91-7222-905-5.In order that the results of rhinostereometric mea¬ surements should be comparable, the head of the test sub- ject must occupy exactly the same position in the coordi¬ nate system every time. Positional accuracy has to be extremely high, since a point on the nasal mucosa moves about 4 mm at the most when the mucosa changes from a state of minimum congestion to one of maximum congestion. Such accuracy is hard to achieve.The object of the invention is to provide a method and a device making it possible to obtain comparable results in rhinostereometric measurements performed on different occasions. This object is achieved by a method having the dis¬ tinctive features recited in appended claim 1 and by a device having the distinctive features recited in appended claim 6. Preferred embodiments of the invention are defin¬ ed in the appended subclaims. Because the position of a person's face in the coor¬ dinate system is determined on each measuring occasion and is then transposed to a reference position in the coordi- 

nate system, comparable results can be obtained on diffe¬ rent measuring occasions regardless of the position of the face in the coordinate system by a corresponding transpo¬ sition of the coordinates of the measured point on the nasal mucosa. In this way, the person's head need not be fixed in exactly the same position on all measuring occa¬ sions, but the head may change positions between them.Preferably, the position of a person's face is deter¬ mined by contactless distance measurement from fixed loca- tions in the coordinate system, e.g. by means of radar, ultrasound or laser. At present, laser is preferred for reasons of accuracy. Also the coordinates of a point on the
