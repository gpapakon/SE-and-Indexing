<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of macromolecular
compounds having tight molecular meshes, for example non-diamond
carbon allotropes and in particular carbon-based
macromolecular structures such as fullerenes, graphite and
amorphous carbons, as therapeutic or diagnostic agents, in
particular as contrast enhancing agents for contrast media
for diagnostic imaging procedures, especially magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), magnetometric imaging (MSI),
electrical impedance tomography (EIT), X-ray, ultrasound
and scintigraphy.Contrast agents may be administered in medical
imaging procedures, for example X-ray, magnetic resonance
and ultrasound imaging, to enhance the image contrast in
images of a subject, generally a human or non-human animal
body. The resulting enhanced contrast enables different
organs, tissue types or body compartments to be more
clearly observed or identified. In X-ray imaging the
contrast agents function by modifying the X-ray absorption
characteristics of the body sites in which they
distribute; magnetic resonance contrast agents generally
function by modifying the density or the characteristic
relaxation times T1, T2 and T2* of the nuclei, generally
water protons, from the resonance signals of which the
images are generated; scintigraphic contrast agents (a
term used herein to include PET contrast agents) act as
emitters of detectable radiation; and magnetometric
contrast agents act by creating peturbations in the
magnetic field in the body zones into which they
distribute, peturbations which can be detected for example
by SQUID magnetometers; and ultrasound contrast agents
function by modifying the speed of sound or the density in
the body sites into which they distribute. The X-ray contrast agents first developed, barium
sulfate and sodium iodide, have been superseded by
iodinated organic compounds, in particular triiodophenyl
compounds. Proposals have also been made to utilize the
X-ray absorption properties of the lanthanides and other
high atomic number metals to develop contrast agents with
improved X-ray attenuation especially at the wavelengths
used in CT; however these attempts have generally been
relatively unsuccessful.Thus, for example, Nalbandian et al. (see Ann. N.Y.
Acad. Sci. 78: 779 (1959)) and Shapiro et al. (see Ann.
N.Y. Acad. Sci. 78: 756 (1959)) proposed the use of the
diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate of
bismuth (BiDTPA) and the ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(EDTA) chelate of lead (PbEDTA) as radiographic contrast
agents but encountered problems
