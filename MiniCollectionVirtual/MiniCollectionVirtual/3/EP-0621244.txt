<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and 
furnace apparatus for bending and 

tempering glass sheets. A glass sheet 
is supported on the same outline mould 

throughout the entire handling 
process. A bending furnace (10) is 

designed to be sufficiently long in 
the traveling direction for carrying a 

partially bent glass sheet towards a 
tempering section (16) in such a 

manner that the glass sheet reaches 
its final shape during the passage 

occurring within the bending furnace 
(10). For this purpose, the glass 

sheet is heated in the bending furnace 
(10) with such a high effect that it 

reaches its tempering temperature 
before reaching its final shape. The 

movements and heating of glass sheets 
are controlled individually on the 

basis of the thickness and measured 
temperature of each glass sheet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for sag-bending and
tempering glass sheets supported on a ring mould, in which
method
a cold glass sheet is placed on a ring mould,the ring mould mould along with its glass sheet is
carried through at least one preheating section into a
bending furnace,the preheated glass sheet is heated in the bending
furnace to a bending and tempering temperature, andthe bent glass sheet is carried into a tempering
section, wherein chilling air is blown to its opposite
surfaces.The invention relates also to a furnace apparatus for
sag-bending and tempering glass sheets, said apparatus
comprising a loading and unloading station, a plurality of
outline moulds provided with carrier wagons therefor, a
separate bending furnace and a separate tempering section
provided with nozzles for blowing chilling air to the
opposite surfaces of a bent glass sheet.The invention is particularly suitable for bending
relatively simple glass shapes that can be bent by the
gravitational use of an outline mould. Many of the
automotive side windows are of such relatively
simple shapes that they can be bent by the application of a
method and apparatus of the invention. There is a prior
known method for essentially the same purpose, wherein a
hemothermal glass is dropped onto an outline mould and the
glass assumes its proper shape by virtue of the inertial
force and the configuration of the outline mould (sag-bending). This
prior known method offers benefits such as high capacity 
and operational reliability but it also involves drawbacks,
such as expensive price, a rather long shape
replacement time (4-5 h), the marks caused by dropping on
the edge areas of a glass, and the high price of tools for
each particular glass.On the other hand, there are prior known single furnaces
operating on the outline mould principle, wherein the
glass is only heated from above and the glass bends to its
shape whose bending or flexural depth is determined by
adjusting the heating time. The advantage offered by
single furnaces is simplicity and a low price but the
notable drawbacks include low capacity, a relatively large
minimum thickness (typically 5 mm, sometimes 4 mm), simple
bending shapes and only a moderate bending accuracy (as
the bending depth is only controlled by means of the heating
time).An object of the invention is to provide an improved
method and furnace apparatus having a favourable price and
a compact size in relation to capacity as well as low
mould-related costs, facilitating also the bending of
glasse
