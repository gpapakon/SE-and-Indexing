<ABSTRACT>
In a distributorless ignition system for an internal combustion engine with a controlled device and with an ignition coil, consisting of a primary coil which is switched by the control device and of a secondary coil with a spark plug connected to one end, further spark plugs are connected to the same terminal of the secondary coil. A controllable semi-conductor switch is connected into the electrical connection from this terminal to the respective spark plug. The semi-conductor switch is switched by the control device at least approximately simultaneously with the primary coil for the spark plug to be fired.

<CLAIMS>
A distributor-less ignition system for an internal combustion engine, 
comprising a control device and an ignition coil made up of a primary coil 

connected by the control device and a secondary coil with a number of 
spark plugs connected to a terminal at one end of the ignition coil, with an 

optically controllable semiconductor switch containing a number of series-connected 
semiconductor elements (102) and inserted in the electric 

connection from the first-mentioned connection to the respective spark plug, 
wherein the semiconductor elements (102) of the semiconductor switch for 

the spark plug to be ignited are activated by the control device via a 
common light-emitting element (104), at least approximately simultaneously 

with the primary coil, 
characterised in that
 the semiconductor switch is 
incorporated in a spark-plug connector inserted in the lead to the respective 

spark plug, and the semiconductor components (102) are disposed around 
the light-emitting element (104) and are at least approximately at the same 

distance therefrom. 
An ignition system according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the 
light-emitting element (104) defines a longitudinal direction and a number of 

semiconductor switches (102) are disposed in series in each row and a 
number of such rows are disposed parallel to one another and to the light-emitting 

element (104), which extends in the longitudinal direction. 
An ignition system according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the 
rows of semiconductor components (102) are disposed around and enclose 

the light-emitting element (104). 
An ignition system according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that
 the 
rows are optically separated from one another by opaque webs (105). 
An ignition system according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised 
in that
 the space between the light-emitting element (104) and the 
semiconductor elements (102) is filled with a light-transmitting insulator.
