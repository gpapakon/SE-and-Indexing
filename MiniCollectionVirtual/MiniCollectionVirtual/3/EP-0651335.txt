<ABSTRACT>
A high speed interface receiver/transmitter is 
particularly suitable for enhancing data throughput rates 

between a DTE and a DCE, such as a modem. The high speed 
interface includes a driver programmed with high speed 

processing software. The driver operates in conjunction with 
modem firmware programmed in a programmable memory within the 

DCE to implement special firmware handshake protocol which 
enables the DTE to transmit or receive data as fast as 

necessary to sustain the required data rate of a particular 
operating mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to data transmitting and 
receiving interface devices and, more particularly, to a 
combined hardware and software interface that substantially 
increases the speed of data transmission and reception 
between a variety of communication devices. With the increase in the development of computer and 
telephone communications systems requiring expanded data 
conversion and processing capabilities, there is greater need 
for data transmission schemes with minimal error and data 
loss between the data terminal equipment (DTE) and the data 
communication equipment (DCE). For example, the increased 
use of audio technology requires high speed voice data 
processing capabilities at very high sampling rates. Such 
advanced technologies, however, in turn, require extremely 
fast data throughput processing for transmitting and 
receiving voice data through the DCE. A conventional DCE implementation generally includes a 
modem (modulator/demodulator) coupled to the DTE. The DTE 
typically includes an arrangement of a personal computer (PC) 
having a central processing unit (CPU) and additional 
processing devices which may be internal or external to the 
base computer. The PC CPU typically drives all or most of 
the operating functions of the PC. To communicate with other  
 
data processing devices, the PC may be coupled to the DCE, 
e.g., the modem peripheral, by a serial or parallel data bus. A conventional modem peripheral may include a standard 
universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (UART) or UART 
emulator in which the format of incoming data is converted. 
A UART device is necessary to achieve compatibility between a 
standard PC and a serial peripheral device, such as a modem. 
A UART essentially functions as a serial-to-parallel or 
parallel-to-serial converter, depending upon whether the 
modem is in a receive or transmit mode, respectively. As 
shown in FIG. 5, within the modem peripheral device, a UART 
is normally coupled to a modem controller which has another 
UART embedded therein. The serial data output from the first 
UART is converted by the modem controller to parallel data, 
and is processed and manipulated through one or more memory 
devices. Ultimately, the data is passed through a data pump, 
and output over the public switched telephone network (PSTN) 
or other output device, such as a speaker in the case of 
audio data. Likewise, data from the PSTN or microphone is 
converted to serial by the modem controller UART and 
converted to parallel by the PC
