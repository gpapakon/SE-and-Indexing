<ABSTRACT>
A coin-deposite lock to be placed on a trolley being part of a row of mutually connected e.g. shopping trolleys or baggage trolleys comprises a main slide (14) being longitudinally slidable against the force from a spring (16) and a measuring slide (20) likewise longitudinally slidable against the force from a second spring (22). Each of the slides (14, 20) has a transverse central aperture (26, 24), and when a coin (C) of a certain value (diameter) has been inserted between the slides, the apertures (24, 26) are mutually aligned. Upon insertion of a key (8) belonging to the lock in a first key opening (6) in the lock, the slides (14, 20) can be moved to a position (Figure 2), in which a latching finger (36) on a pivotable release member (34) engages in the mutually aligned apertures (24, 26) and retains the slides (14, 20) and the coin (C) between them in a withdrawn position. At the same time, the release member (34) pivots to a position, in which a second latching finger (38) on it frees a second key (12) associated with a previous trolley in the row thus freeing the trolley from the row.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin-deposit lock, 
said lock being adapted to be placed on a trolley and being 
of the kind set forth in the preamble of claim 1. Coin-deposit locks of this kind are e.g. disclosed in 
the DK Published Applications Nos. 145,550 and 145,952, and 
the International Application No. WO82/01950 being included 
herein by reference. These coin-deposit locks suffer from 
the disadvantage that they are not especially selective 
with regard to the size and hence the value of the coin 
having been inserted, for which reason they are less suitable 
for achieving the purpose of such coin-deposit locks, viz. 
to ensure that the trolley is returned and connected to the 
row of trolleys, to which it belongs, so that the amount 
deposited is returned. On the above background, it is the object of the 
present invention to provide a coin-deposit lock of the 
kind referred to above, said lock being adapted to sense 
the size and hence the value of the coin having been inserted, 
and which only releases the trolley from the row of 
trolleys, if the inserted coin has the correct size. This object is achieved with a coin-deposit lock 
additionally exhibiting the features set forth in the characterizing 
clause of claim 1. If, with this arrangement, the coin having been inserted 
has a larger diameter than the correct coin (provided 
that it is at all possible to insert the coin in the coin-insertion 
opening) or a smaller diameter than the correct 
coin, then the first latching member on the release member 
cannot engage in the through-going apertures in the main  
 
slide and the measuring slide, and the release member cannot 
pivot towards its first position and release the second key 
belonging to a preceding trolley in the row from the second 
key opening so as to liberate the trolley from the row of 
trolleys. Then, the wrong coin having been inserted will 
simply be returned to the coin-insertion opening when the 
first key is again removed from the first key opening. Solely 
when a coin of the correct size is inserted into the coin-insertion 
opening, the second key will be freed from the 
coin-deposit lock and the first key will be retained in 
the lock. Admittedly, parts of the features set forth in the 
characterizing clause of claim 1 are disclosed in the DK 
Published Application No. 163,387, but this publication 
relates to a coin-deposit lock of a different kind from the 
one set forth in the preamble of claim 1, as this known 
coin-deposit lock has only one single key opening
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Coin-deposit lock to be placed on a trolley capable 
of being part of a row of such trolleys connected to each 

other, said trolleys especially being in the form of shopping 
trolleys and baggage trolleys, said coin-deposit lock being 

adapted to liberate a trolley connected to the row by the 
insertion of a coin of a certain value in the lock and to 

free the coin having been inserted when the trolley is replaced 
and re-connected to the row, said coin-deposit lock 

being of the kind comprising a coin-insertion opening (66), 
a pivotable release member (34) and two key openings capable 

of being blocked, viz. a first key opening (6) for receiving 
and retaining a first key (8) belonging to the coin-deposit 

lock and a second key opening (10) for receiving and 
retaining a second key (12) belonging to a corresponding 

coin-deposit lock on a preceding trolley in the row, 

characterized
 by the combination of a sensing means for the 
coin size comprising a spring-biased main slide (14) and a 

spring-biased measuring slide (20) and the pivotable release 
member (34), in which the insertion of a correct coin (C) 

in the coin-insertion opening (66) followed by the insertion 
of the first key (8) in the first key opening (6) causes 

the coin (C), the main slide (14) and the measuring slide 
(20) to be moved forward to a retained position within the 

lock and pivoting of the release member (34) to a first 
position (Figure 2), in which a first latching member (36) 

on the release member (34) engages in a through-going aperture 
(24,26) in the main slide (14) and the measuring slide 

(20) and retains these slides, and a second latching member 
(38) on the release member (34) is disengaged from an aperture 

(40) in the second key (12) and frees the latter from 
the second key opening (10), and in which re-insertion of 

the second key (12) in the second key opening (10) causes 
pivoting of the release member (34) to a second position 

(Figure 1), in which the first latching member (36) frees 
the main slide (14) and the measuring slide (20), and the  

 
coin (C) is returned to the coin-insertion opening (66), and 

in which the second latching member (38) engages in the 
aperture (40) in the second key (12) and retains the latter 

in the second key opening (10), and in which the release 
member (34) has a third latching member (42), in the first 

position (Figure 2) of the release member (34) engaging in 
an aperture (44) in the first key (8) and retaining the 

latter in the first key opening (6), and in the second 
position (Figure 1) of the release member (34) being disengaged 

from the aperture (44) in the first key (8) and liberates 
the latter from the first key opening (6). 
Coin-deposit lock according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
by the main slide (14) and measuring slide (20) 

each having an aperture (24,26), said apertures, when a 
coin (C) of said certain value has been inserted between the 

slides (14,20), are mutually aligned and able to be engaged 
by the first latching member (36) on the release member (34). 
Coin-deposit lock according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
by further comprising a first (46) and a second 

(48) ejector, said ejectors being spring-biased away from 
each other by ejector springs (50), wherein the first ejector 

(46) by insertion of the first key (8) in the first key 
opening (6) is moved towards the second ejector (48) and 

retained by a fourth latching member (52) on the release 
member (34) in the latter's first position (Figure 2), while 

at the same time, a fifth latching member (56) on the release 
member (34) frees the second ejector (48) so that the latter 

moves the second key (12) out from the second key opening 
(10), and wherein the second ejector (48) upon insertion of 

the second key (12) in the second key opening (10) is moved 
towards the first ejector (46) and retained by the fifth 

latching member (56) on the release member (34) in the latter's 
second position (Figure 1), while the first ejector 

(46) is freed from the fourth latching member (52) on the 
release member (34), so that it moves the first key (8) out 

from the first key opening (6).  
 
Coin-deposit lock according to claim 3, 
characterized
 
by a slide (60) placed between the first (46) and 

the second (48) ejector and adapted for limited movement

from the first ejector (46), said slide (60) being engaged 
with a pin (64) on the pivotable release member (34) in 

order to switch the latter from its first position (Figure 
2) to its second position (Figure 1), and vice versa.
