Use of compositions of fluids comprising aluminium 
carboxylates as electro-viscous fluids characterized 

in that these are homogeneous electro-viscous fluids 
and contain aluminium salts of organic acids as 

electro-viscous active component, whereby the 
aluminium salts of organic acids are produced by 

reacting one or more saturated and / or unsaturated 
monomeric, oligomeric and / or polymeric C
3
 to C
32
 
polycarboxylic acid(s) having one or more carboxylic 

groups, the anhydrides and / or semi-esters thereof, 
the alcohol component(s) thereof are straight or 

branched, monohydric or polyhydric C
1
 to C
12
 alcohols 
and / or the oligomers thereof with one or more 

aluminium alcoholates, the alcohol components 
thereof are one or more aliphatic straight or 

branched, mono- or polyhydric C
1
 to C
18
 alcohols. 
Use according to claim 1 characterized in that the 
compositions of fluids contain aluminium salts of 

organic acids which are produced by reacting one or 
more polycarboxylic acids, anhydrides or semi-esters 

with 3 to 18 carbon atoms, particularly with 12 to 
18 carbon atoms. 
Use according to claim 1 or 2 characterized in that 

the compositions of fluids contain aluminium salts 
of organic acids which are produced by reacting one 

or more alkenyl succinic acids and or semi-esters  
 

thereof with 5 to 18 carbon atoms, particularly with 
12 to 18 carbon atoms. 
Use according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the compositions of fluids 

contain aluminium salts of organic acids which are 
products obtained by reacting polycarboxylic acids, 

anhydrides or semi-esters with aluminium 
alcoholates, all or part of the valences of the 

aluminium having been reacted. 
Use according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the compositions of fluids 

contain aluminium salts of organic acids, which are 
products obtained by reacting polycarboxylic acids, 

the anhydrides and particularly the semi-esters 
thereof, which comprise one ore more free OH groups 

with aluminium alcoholates. 
Use according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the compositions of fluids 

contain aluminium salts of organic acids, which are 
a product obtained by reacting semi-esters, the 

alcohol component(s) thereof are di- to tetrahydric 
alcohols with 1 to 6 carbon atoms, particularly 2 to 

5 carbon atoms and the oligomers thereof.  
 
Use according to any of the preceding claims 
characterized in that the composition of the fluids 

consists of: 

(a) 2 to 50 wt.-% of the aluminium salts of organic 
acids in homogeneous solution with 
(b) 50 to 98 wt.-% of a conventional hydraulic base 
fluid, and additionally 
(c) 0 to 10 wt.-% soluble hydraulic oil additives known 
per se, 
 
each referring to the total composition. 
Use according to any of the claims 1 to 6 
characterized in that the composition of the fluids 

consists of: 

(a) 5 to 40 wt.-% of the aluminium salts of organic 
acids in homogeneous solution with 
(b) 60 to 95 wt.-% of a conventional hydraulic base 
fluid and additionally 
(c) 0 to 5 wt.-% of soluble hydraulic oil additives 
known per se, 
 
each referring to the total composition.
