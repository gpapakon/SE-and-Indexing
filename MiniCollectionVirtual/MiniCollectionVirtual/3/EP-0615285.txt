<ABSTRACT>
Integrated circuits such as transponders (10) are attached to a substrate 
(28) such as cardboard packaging material by adhering an integrated 

circuit to the substrate, applying a patch antenna (18) to the substrate 
and the integrated circuit, and applying a sealing layer (40) over the 

integrated circuit and at least a portion of the antenna. In variations of 
the method, an indentation (34) may be formed in the substrate into 

which the integrated circuit is placed. The patch antenna may be screen 
printed onto the substrate and the integrated circuit, using conductive 

ink, or may be a metallic foil which is applied to the substrate and the 
integrated circuit. Where the integrated circuit is a transponder, it can 

be programmed with an identification code, either before or after being 
attached to the substrate.

<DESCRIPTION>
South African patent application no. 92/0039 describes an identification 
system in which transponders are attached to articles to be identified, 
such as containers or packaged articles in a supermarket, with the 
transponders carrying an identification code which identifies each article, 
either uniquely or as one of a number of articles of a particular type. In order for such a system to be economically viable, it is important to 
provide a relatively simple but effective way of attaching the 
transponders to the containers or packages.  According to the invention a method of attaching an electronic circuit 
to a substrate comprises:
 
   providing an electronic circuit having at least two electrical 
terminals;
 
   securing the electronic circuit to the substrate; and
 
   applying a conductive element to the substrate and the electronic 
circuit to define an antenna, so that the conductive element 
makes electrical contact with the at least two electrical terminals. The conductive element may comprise a layer of conductive ink, printed 
in the shape of the antenna. The conductive ink may comprise carbon or metallic particles. Alternatively, the conductive element may comprise a metallic foil. The metallic foil may be applied to the electronic circuit prior to 
securing the integrated circuit to the substrate, with the foil and the 
circuit being applied together to the substrate. Alternatively, the metallic foil may be applied to the substrate after the 
electronic circuit has been secured to the substrate. The metallic foil may have an adhesive layer thereon for securing the  
 
foil to the substrate. The adhesive layer is preferably removed from the metallic foil in areas 
corresponding to the position of the electrical terminals of the electronic 
circuit prior to application of the foil to the electronic circuit or the 
substrate. The metallic foil may be applied to the substrate prior to securing the 
electronic circuit to the substrate, and the electronic circuit may be 
subsequently attached to predetermined areas of the metallic foil, 
thereby to secure the electronic circuit to the substrate. The electrical contacts of the electronic circuit may be attached to 
predetermined areas of the foil using a conductive adhesive. The method may include applying solder to the at least two electrical 
terminals, applying the conductive layer to the substrate so that it makes 
contact with the terminals, and reflowing the solder to join the antenna 
to the terminals. The method may include forming a
