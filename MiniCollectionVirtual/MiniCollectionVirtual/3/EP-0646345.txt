<ABSTRACT>
A flexible endoscopic probe (10) is provided. The probe 
includes a fiber optic image guide (24) and a lens (32) adhered to 

the distal end (20) of the fiber optic image guide. one or more 
fiber optic illumination fibers (36) surround the image guide 

and terminate at the distal end of the probe. These 
illumination fibers are held in place by a short retaining 

tube (38) and a potting material (40) injected into the spaces 
between the fibers, the image guide and the retaining tube. 

Depending on the application, an additional covering layer (44) 
can be added to provide an additional environmental 

barrier. A method of manufacturing the flexible probe is 
also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to medical 
diagnostic devices. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to devices used during endoscopic 
procedures. The present invention particularly, though not 
exclusively, relates to fiber optic, flexible endoscope 
probes and their method of manufacture. Modern surgical procedures attempt to minimize the 
invasive aspects of surgery. This is the result of the 
widely accepted belief that patient discomfort, overall 
recovery time, as well as the likelihood of post-surgical 
complications are generally proportional to the 
invasiveness of the particular procedure. One way to reduce the invasiveness of surgical 
procedures such as exploratory surgery is through the use 
of endoscopes. Endoscopy is a surgical procedure where a 
thin scope is placed into the person being examined. Some 
specific examples include laparoscopy, where a scope is 
placed into the abdominal cavity, esophascopy, where the 
scope is placed into the esophagus, and arthroscopy, where 
the scope is placed into a joint. Using endoscopes, the surgeon is able to view the 
interior of the person's body without the necessity of 
making a large incision. Instead, the endoscope, which 
includes a thin, insertable probe, requires only a small 
incision or hole into which the probe is inserted. It is 
the reduced trauma at the entry point which results in the 
reduced recovery time and reduced post-surgical 
complications such as infections or ruptured suture lines. 
Reduced trauma results because both the skin and the 
musculature are only minimally disturbed. The rapidly expanding uses for endoscopy require new 
types of instruments which are minimally invasive. For 
example, in an esophascopy procedure which seeks to allow  
 
a surgeon to inspect a person's esophagus and/or stomach, 
the probe of the esophascope is placed into the esophagus 
and/or into the stomach. Typical esophascopes are structurally representative 
of other types of endoscopes. For example, the probe 
portion typically includes a relatively rigid outer tube 
which contains an image guide as well as a light source. 
The image guide and light source are often optical fibers. 
The light source is used to illuminate the area adjacent 
the tip of the probe of the scope. Light reflected by 
objects is picked up by a lens which is also at the tip of 
the probe. The lens then directs the reflected light into 
the image guide which transfers the light to a video camera 
or other imaging means. Importantly, it is the
