<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information displayer with 
interchangeable boards. More particularly, the invention relates to a device of the above 
kind that allows to display different boards, particularly advertising boards 
in a selective manner. It is well known to those who are experts in the art that more or 
less recently different kinds of devices have been realized, said devices 
allowing to change the image displayed towards the public. A first device of this kind provides a number of horizontal 
triangular-shaped elements that can rotate about their horizontal axis, so 
that, rotating the different faces in synchronism, it is possible to change 
the message that is visible to the public according to a predetermined 
timing. Is is well evident that this kind of device is rather limiting from 
a functional point of view: in fact, it allows the vision of only three different 
advertising messages, and only according to a rigid sequence. Furthermore, if it is desired to replace the advertising message, 
it is practically necessary to replace all the device, such an operation 
involving high costs and remarkable practical drawbacks. A second kind of device to display different images to the 
public already available on the market is the one comprising a sheet 
wound on two rolls and having a sequence of images to be displayed 
printed on it. Winding and unwinding the sheet on said rolls it will be 
possible to change the message shown to the public. In this case the number of available messages can also be 
high, although it is in any case is limited by the sizes of the sheet. However, the above device does not allow to propose the 
messages according to a casual and selective sequence, since the choice 
is binded by the order of the messages printed on the sheet. Furthermore, it is very difficult, troublesome and expensive, or 
even impossible or economically not convenient, to replace the sheet with 
another one having a different group of advertising messages. In GB-A-182 964 a picture displaying apparatus is disclosed, 
said apparatus comprising removable picture roll drums or carriers and  
 
preferably means for rendering the picture exhibiting mechanism 
inoperable unless it is in the correct operating position. In US-A-1 700 435 an automatic advertising machine is 
described wherein a number of advertisements are singly and 
consecutively brought into view. In view of the above, the Applicant has studied and realized a 
displayer of multiple information or images that allows to
