<ABSTRACT>
An electrolytic water producing method and device can 
control the electrolytic degree of electrolytic water 

(W1,W2) discharged from an electrolyzer (1,301,601) having 
anode and cathode chambers (1a,1b;301a,301b;401a,401b; 

501a,501b;601a,601b) partitioned by an ion-permeable 
barrier membrane (3,303,503,603) so as to produce 

electrolytic water having the desired pH value in 
accordance with the pH value, electric conductivity, 

oxidation-reduction potential, and ion concentration. The 
electrolytic degree of the electrolytic water is 

controlled by injecting a regulated electrolyte solution 
(SS) into raw water (WO) to be supplied into the 

electrolyzer (1,301,601), regulating the flow quantity of 
the raw water and/or the electrolytic water discharged

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and device for 
producing electrolytic water such as acidic water usable 
as rinsing or disinfecting water and alkaline water which 
may be used as drinking water with high efficiency, and 
more particularly to an electrolytic water producing 
method and device capable of suitably controlling 
electrolysis of water to efficiently produce the acidic 
and/or alkaline water having a desired electrolytic 
degree. In general, it has been known that acidic electrolytic 
water having low pH value showing acidic properties can be 
used as rinsing or disinfecting water in a food or medical 
field. However, such acidic water being low in acidity 
could not be stably produced in large quantities with 
ease. A conventional water-electrolyzing device for producing 
electrolytic water fundamentally comprises an electrolyzer 
having anode and cathode chambers which are partitioned by 
an ion-permeable barrier membrane, and anode and cathode 
electrodes set in the anode and cathode chambers. When 
applying an electric current to the anode and cathode 
electrodes, raw water introduced into the electrolyzer is 
electrolyzed, so that the water in the cathode chamber is 
increased in pH value to be made alkali, and at the same 
time, the water in the anode chamber is decreased in pH 
value to be made acidic. Thus, acidic water having the 
low pH value and alkaline water having the high pH value 
can be produced simultaneously. It has however been 
difficult to continuously produce the acidic water and 
alkaline water having the desired electrolytic degree in 
large quantities. Incidentally, the electrolytic degree 
signifies the pH value, electric conductivity, oxidation-reduction 
potential and/or ion concentration of water.  
 Typical service water to drink has small electric 
conductivity (EC value) of about 100 to 200 Âµ/cm and 
substantial neutrality of about pH 6.5 to 8. Although the 
electrolysis in the electrolyzer can possibly be more 
activated by increasing the electric current applied to the 
anode and cathode electrodes, thereby to produce a large 
quantity of electrolytic water, the voltage must be increased 
in order to produce the electrolytic water in large quantities 
because the electric current is reluctant to flow through the 
pure drinking water being low in electric conductivity, thus 
disadvantageously consuming large electricity. Furthermore, the convention general purpose water-electrolyzing 
device has suffered a drawback in that only 
slightly acidic
