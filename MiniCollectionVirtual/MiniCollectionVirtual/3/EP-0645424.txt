<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a rubber
composition suitable for reinforcing bead portions
of pneumatic tyres, and more particularly to a
rubber composition suitable for use in a chafer in
the bead portions of heavy duty tyres for auto
truck, auto bus and other large vehicles.Tyres used for trucks, buses and so on are required
to have high speed performance because of the spread
of superhighways, in addition they must bear greater
loads due to the increase of size and load of
vehicles. Consequently, rubber compositions used in
the chafer disposed in the beads of tyres are
required more and more to have high hardness, high
durability and high ageing resistance.Since these types of tyres are recapped and
retreaded to replace their tread rubber after the
completion of first life, they are required to be
particularly free from fault. One fault which makes
recap of used tyres impossible is deformation of the
bead in a tubed tyre. Bead deformation is a
phenomenon in tubes tyres where rubber in the bead
is located in a spacing between the wheel rim and a 
ring, thus resulting in deformation during long term
use. Rubber compositions used in chafers in beads
of tubed tyres are required to have high hardness,
high durability and high ageing resistance in order
to prevent occurrence of this phenomenon.In order to obtain rubber compositions satisfying
these properties, it has been practised (1) to
specially select the kind of carbon black or to
increase the amount of carbon black, (2) to increase
the amount of sulfur, or (3) to use an ultra-accelerator
TT (tetramethylthiuramdisulfide).
However, the use of a large amount of carbon black
causes problems in processing as it become difficult
to conduct milling with good dispersion, and burning
takes place due to heat generation resulting from
the high loading, and the problem that the crack
growth resistance of the rubber is deteriorated.When a large amount of sulfur is incorporated in a
rubber, there arise problem changes in physical
properties owing to heat, changes in physical
properties with the lapse of time and permanent set
(deformation owing to heat) becomes large, and the
ageing resistance and resistance to breaks such as
cracking are deteriorated. Since the thiuram ultra-accelerator TT produces
nitrosoamine which is a carcinogenic substance and
it was found to be a mutagen, its use is being
prohibited.It is also proposed in Japanese Patent Publication
Kokoku No 57-20164 to incorporate a syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadiene
short fibre into a rubber.
However, such
