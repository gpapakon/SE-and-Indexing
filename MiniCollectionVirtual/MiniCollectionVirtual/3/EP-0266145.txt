<ABSTRACT>
An improved method and apparatus for performing 
operations on mathematical expressions in a data 

processing device, in which stored menus having labels 
of operations, performable on mathematical expressions 

which are concordant with the syntax of individual 
expressions, are individually addressed by each expression 

developed in the data processing device. A selected 
label from a menu addressed by an expression is employed 

to perform an operation upon the expression. A change 
in form of an expression by a label of one menu, 

for example, selecting a subexpression of the expression, 
may address another menu. Where more than one menu 

exists for an expression a menu group is addressed by 
that expression and one menu of that group is displayed. 

The displayed menu and/or another menu or other menues 
from that group may be selected to provide labels for 

performing operations upon that expression.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to electronic data 
processors and scientific calculators and more particularly to 
methods and apparatuses in such processors and calculators for 
providing improved algebraic expression manipulation 
capabilities. Scientific calculators are typically hand held or desk-top 
devices which include a manually actuable keyboard for 
receiving input data and operational commands from the operator 
and a visual display for communicating results to the operator. 
A more recent development is the provision of an alphanumeric 
display which allows for the entry, display, and editing of data 
structures which are more complicated than simple numbers. In 
particular, it allows for entry, display, and editing of 
equations and algebraic expressions. The increasing complexity of these scientific calculators 
together with the trend toward providing more diverse data 
structures has provided impetus for automating the editing process 
for these data structures. Previous calculators have 
employed so called character editors for editing equations and 
algebraic expressions, wherein the operator may delete, insert,  
 
or overwrite individual characters or groups of characters in 
the displayed form of the equation or expression. While character editors are useful and important for 
the correction of operator inputting errors, they are highly 
deficient for the purpose of rearranging a formally correct 
expression which appears in an inappropriate form. As an example, 
consider the expressions:(alog(2N)+1)-alog(2N) and (alog (2N)-alog(2N))+1 
 
where alog is the common antilogarithm function, and N is the 
number of significant digits carried by the calculator. While 
these expressions are formally equivalent, they will yield different 
results when evaluated on the calculator, and only the 
second form will yield the correct result. A primary deficiency 
of a character editor, then, is that it will not allow the operator 
to transform the first expression into the second expression 
without considerable effort and the possibility of introducing 
errors into the expression. A second deficiency of character editors for this kind 
of editing is the lack of guidance for the operator in the 
processes of transforming an expression into a formally equivalent 
one.

A data processor for performing mathematical operations 
upon a mathematical expression concordant with the syntax of 

the mathematical expression, comprising: 

(a) a processing device (201); 
(b) a memory (203,204,RAM 1,RAM 2); 
(c) menu objects, mathematical function objects (Ln, +) and 
number objects (1,2.3) stored in said memory; 
(d) individual interface elements (104,105,107,etc.); 
(e) object advancing means including a data pointer stack 
(305) in memory between individual interface elements 

(202) and individual object locations in said memory, 
each pointer (1006) addressing a respective object in 

memory, sequential operation of selected interface 
elements selecting corresponding pointers on said data 

pointer stack and hence menu objects, mathematical 
function objects and number objects in the sequence of 

operation of said interface elements, thereby forming 
a mathematical expression object [Ln(2.3+1)]
 recorded 
in said memory; 
(f) said menu objects comprising individual mathematical 
menu objects which are related, respectively, to 

differing mathematical expressions, each mathematical 
menu object comprising individual recorded menu items 

(602-604) respectively defining mathematical operations 
(704) to be performed on a mathematical expression 

concordant with the syntax of that mathematical 
expression; 
(g) mathematical menu object selection means between memory

are recorded and memory (203,204) whereat mathematical 

menu objects are stored, a mathematical expression 
object when recorded in memory addressing a specific 

mathematical menu object stored in memory;

(i) object display means (200,201,205,206) between said 
interface elements (202) and said display device

individual mathematical function objects and number 
objects in the sequence of selection and addressing and 

of the resulting mathematical expression object recorded

mathematical operations of a menu item (602-604) 
selected from the display of menu items by operation of 

an interface element. 
The data processor of claim 1, wherein said display 
means (205,206) cause each object addressed by a selected
