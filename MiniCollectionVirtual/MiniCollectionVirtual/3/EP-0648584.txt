<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a machine and to a method for manufacturing ready-to use cladding panels (tiles), the method consisting in:   - securing together a moving support (4) and at least one tile (8) which, together with a substrate, is intended to form a cladding panel by at least partial submersion of the tile (8) into the substrate; - shifting the said moving support (4) and the substrate one against the other until the tile (8) becomes immersed in a chosen arrangement; - keeping the support and substrate immobile until the tile (8) has become fixed in the said arrangement, by solidifying the adhesive layer; and - detaching the tile thus fixed to the substrate of the cladding panel thus obtained from the support.   The invention applies to the production of cladding panels, for example based on tiling.
