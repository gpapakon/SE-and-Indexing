<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for filling a flexible container with gas essentially instantaneously upon the occurrence of powerful retardation forces, wherein the gas-filled container functions as a force-absorbing cushion for protection against injury. The arrangement includes a gas-filled high-pressure vessel, a conduit which connects the pressure vessel to the container, a mechanical opening device for opening the connection between the vessel and the container upon the occurrence of a retardation force which exceeds a smallest value, and a retardation meter. The arrangement is characterized in that the vessel is filled with a gas which exhibits a reversed Joule-Thomson effect.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for
filling an empty flexible container essentially instantaneously
with a gas when the speed of an automotive vehicle
in which the container is installed is greatly and abruptly
retarded, wherein the container is intended to prevent
injury to person or persons present in the vehicle, or to
reduce the extent of the injury sustained in the event of
a collision for instance.Certain cars are quipped with so-called airbags as
an alternative or as a supplement to standard vehicle
safety harnesses. These bags are swiftly inflated in front
of the driver or passengers of the vehicle in the event of
a collision, so as to shield the driver or passengers from
such injuries as those which might be inflicted when
thrown forwards against the steering wheel or the instrument
panel.Hitherto, vehicles have not been quipped with airbags
for backseat passengers. The reason is possibly
because backseat passengers would require much
larger bags, which is probably associated with a number
of problems which can be related purely to gas kinetics.In the event of a head-on collision, or any other collision,
in which the vehicle is stopped very quickly it is
necessary for the container to be inflated with gas and
form an airbag or a gas cushion before the person is
thrown forward against the backrest of the front seat or
against the steering wheel/or the instrument panel at the
initial speed of the vehicle.In order to obtain effective protection, it is estimated
that the airbag must be inflated within one-hundredth of
a second.Assuming that a car is travelling at a speed of 110
km/hour when a collision occurs, a person seated in the
car will be moved through a distance of about 0.3 meter
in relation to the ground in this time. Since the actual
body of the vehicle will not stop instantaneously, owing
to the fact that the front of the vehicle is buckled-in
through a distance of one or more decimeters, the driver
or passengers of the vehicle have time to move about
one to two decimeters relative to the vehicle body in 0.01
seconds, which means that the airbag has time to inflate
and to prevent the driver or passengers being thrown
onto the driving wheel, the instrument panel or the backrest
of the seat in front.A device for filing a flexible container (airbag) essentially
instantaneously with gas upon the occurrence of
powerful retardation forces is known from DE-A1-2061759.
The device comprises a flexible container to
be filled with gas, an elongated pressurized vessel containing

An arrangement for filling a flexible container essentially
instantaneously with gas upon the occurrence

of powerful retardation forces, wherein the gas-filled
container functions as a force-absorbing cushion for

protection against injury, and wherein the arrangement
includes a high-pressure vessel containing

helium, a conduit which connects the pressure vessel
to the container, a mechanical opening device

for opening the connection between the vessel and
the container upon the occurrence of a retardation

force which exceeds a smallest value, and a retardation
meter, 
characterized
 in that the high-pressure
vessel mainly contains helium and

hydrogen.
An arrangement according to Claim 1, 
characterized

in that the hydrogen concentration of the gas
mixture is below the value at which the mixture is

combustible in the presence of ambient air.
An arrangement according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized

in that the gaseous mixture contains less
than 15 percent by volume hydrogen.
