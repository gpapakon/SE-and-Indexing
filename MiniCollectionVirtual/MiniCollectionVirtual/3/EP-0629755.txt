<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of laying a floor. The 
floor is built up of parts butting together with their edges, which are 

laid on a subfloor. A layer consisting of an elastic and/or resilient 
material is provided on at least part of a subfloor in tautened condition. 

Parts butting on each other are successively glued onto said layer 
consisting of a resilient material. The layer consisting of an elastic 

and/or resilient material may at its upper side be provided with an 
adhesive layer covered by paper or the like material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of laying a floor as
described in the pre-characterising part of claim 1.From FR-A-2 237 035 there is known a method for laying a
floor wherein a layer consisting of a sheet of filt covered on both sides
with an elastomer is adhered to a subfloor. On said layer there are glued
tiles or the like.The purpose of the invention is to obtain a method wherein it
is possible to provide the parts, closely butting together, on the
subfloor in a simple manner.According to the invention this may be achieved as defined in
the characterising part of claim 1.By adhering or glueing the parts generally consisting of wood
or the like material entirely or partly on an elastic and/or resilient
material layer in a tautened condition it may be achieved that the parts
of the upper layer are constantly pulled together under tension by the
layer consisting of an elastic and/or resilient material, thus preventing
the formation of cracks and the like between the parts as a result of
shrinking and/or swelling caused by changes in the air humidity.The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter with
reference to the accompanying figures, which diagrammatically shows a
sectional view of a part of a floor during its laying.The figure shows the usual subfloor 1 present in a building
or the like, which is in many cases a concrete floor provided with a
finishing layer, but which may for example also be a wooden subfloor or
the like.On this subfloor a layer 2 consisting of an elastic and/or
resilient material has been provided. Said sublayer 2 may be a layer,
which may or may not be massive, of plastic material and/or rubber having
open or closed cells.When being laid on the subfloor 1, covering the subfloor 1
entirely or partly, for example in strips, said layer 2 of an elastic
and/or resilient material is pulled quite taut and fixed to the subfloor
in its tautened condition. Said fixing to the subfloor 1 of the layer 2
consisting of an elastic and/or resilient material may be done in an
efficient manner by glueing said layer 2 to the floor 1. For this purpose 
the layer 2 may be provided with an adhesive layer (not shown) on its
bottom side, which may be covered by a layer of paper or the like prior
to the layer 2 being applied to the floor 1.Furthermore it is possible to partly fix the layer 2 to
the subfloor 1 in its tautened condition by means of double-sided adhesive
strips, which might be removed after the floor parts have been laid.It is noted that in many cases it is not absolutely
neces

<CLAIMS>
A method of laying a floor comprising placing a layer (2)
consisting of an elastic and/or resilient material on a subfloor (1),

and thereafter successively glueing onto said layer an upper layer
built up of a plurality of parts (5, 6) with abutting edges,

characterised in that the elastic and/or resilient material layer (2)
is installed on the subfloor (1) in the tautened condition whereafter

said parts (5, 6) are glued on said layer (2). 
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that said
layer (2) consisting of an elastic and/or resilient material is at its

upper side provided with an adhesive layer (3) covered by paper (4) or
the like material, which is removed over part of said layer (2)

consisting of an elastic and/or resilient material prior to laying a
first part (5) of the upper layer on said layer (2) consisting of an

elastic and/or resilient material and which is folded back prior to
said first part (5) of the upper layer being laid on said layer (2)

consisting of an elastic and/or resilient material, after which the
next part (6) of the upper layer is laid on the folded-back layer of

paper (4) and is pressed against the first part (5) of the upper layer
so as to butt tightly against said first part (5) of the upper layer,

after which said layer of paper (4) is pulled away from under said
second part (6) of the upper layer.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
said layer (2) consisting of an elastic and/or resilient material is

laid on the entire surface or on parts of the surface of the subfloor
(1), for example in strips.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that said layer (2) consisting of an elastic and/or

resilient material is at its bottom side provided with an adhesive
layer, by means of which said layer (2) consisting of an elastic

and/or resilient material is adhered or glued to the subfloor (1).
A method according to any one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that use is made of a layer (2) consisting of an

elastic and/or resilient material, which is provided
on a protective layer of paper and which is loosely provided

on the subfloor (1) or only fixed with respect thereto near the sides
of the subfloor.
