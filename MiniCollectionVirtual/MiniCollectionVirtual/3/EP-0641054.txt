<ABSTRACT>
A strain relief device (cable grip) (10) for a cable guiding arrangement (51) having a cable duct (22) for at least one cable (23, 24) (which is guided in the cable duct (22)) having a first connecting device (13, 15, 17; 14, 16, 17), which acts in a force-fitting manner, for the connection of an equipment device, which is to be connected to the cable or cables (23, 24), to the cable duct (22), and having a further connecting device (20), which acts in a force-fitting manner, for connection of the cable or cables (23, 24) to the first connecting device, the further connecting device being formed from a soft-elastic material insert (20) which has a rough surface (which abuts against the surfaces) and fills the radial interspace between the cable or cables and the first connecting device.
