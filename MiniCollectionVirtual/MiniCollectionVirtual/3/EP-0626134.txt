<ABSTRACT>
A pesticidal barrier, which may be used as a liner 
for a building excavation to protect the building to be 

constructed from infestation by termites and other insect 
pests, takes the form of a flexible membrane. The membrane 

comprises an assembly of fibers or filaments. The assembly has 
an average void volume of less than 85% when measured under a 

pressure of 10kPa (1.45 psi). The fibers in the assembly have 
an average fiber size of less than 6 denier. The assembly 

integrally incorporates within its structure, or has above or 
below its structure, an array or network of connected 

permeable-walled tubes, so that an insecticide may be delivered 
to all parts of the membrane, particularly after the barrier 

has been installed at a building site.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a flexible membrane for permanent
burial in the soil at a building site as a barrier against
termites and other subterranean pests, said membrane comprising
an assembly of interconnencted fibers.Insect pest control devices comprising some form of bonded
textile fibers coated with an insecticide are known in the
art. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,103,450 to Whitcomb shows
an insecticidal device, which uses a lofty bonded web of
textile fibers as a scaffold for insecticidal materials, which
may subsequently volatilize therefrom into the ambient air.
The device purports to permit control over the location,
distribution and dispersal of the volatile insecticide deployed
therein, and may be simply discarded when the quantity of
the insecticide remaining therein falls below an effective
level. The device is said to have a number of advantages,
particularly for household applications, because it may be
deployed readily in small spaces behind appliances which may
attract insects. Because the insects in question may actually
crawl through the interstices between the textile fibers in
the lofty assembly, thereby coming into prolonged direct
physical contact with the 
insecticide being used, the Whitcomb device is highly efficient
in its use of the insecticide.The emphasis in the Whitcomb patent is on a lofty,
resilient, highly porous structure which provides an effective,
but temporary, means of controlling domestic insect pests in
the interior of a house. However, the solution to problems
encountered in exterior, or outdoor, insect control requires a
totally different approach. For example, in many parts of the
world, termites are endemic, and, as cellulose forms their
principal food material, they can cause a great deal of damage
to wooden structures. Typically, termite colonies build nests
underground in the soil near ground level, in a stump or other
source of timber, or in the trunk of a living tree. Colonies
may persist for years and may attain populations running into
millions of individuals.Termite attacks originate from the nest. Timber
lying on or buried, partially or completely, in the ground may
be reached by underground foraging galleries. Attacks may also
be carried out well above the ground surface via access
passages constructed by the termites from mud or earth on a
concrete or brick building foundation.Both a building and its contents may be provided with
significant protection by means of a chemical soil barrier
which prevents the attacking termites from reaching

<CLAIMS>
A flexible membrane for permanent burial in the soil (32)
at a building site (30) as a barrier against termites and

other subterranean pests, comprising an assembly of interconnected
fibers (12), characterized in that said fibers

(12) have an average size smaller than 6 denier, and said
assembly has an average void volume of less than 85% when

measured under a pressure of 10kPa (1.45 psi), and at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) contiguous with said

assembly, said tube (14) being permeable-walled to permit
a liquid within to pass therethrough, so that said at

least one permeable-walled tube (14) may convey an insecticide
throughout said flexible membrane (10) while said

flexible membrane (10) is in situ at a building site (30).
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein the
average distance between fiber crossing points within said

assembly is less than 100 microns (0.1 mm), whereby said
termites and other subterranean pests are prevented from

entering therein.
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
assembly comprises fibers (12) of a synthetic, polymeric

resin.
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 where said
assembly comprises ceramic fibers (12).
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said
assembly comprises metallic fibers (12). 
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable walled tube (14) is of a synthetic,

polymeric resin.
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) extends transversely

across said assembly of interconnected fibers (12).
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) extends transversely

across and longitudinally along said assembly of interconnected
fibers (12) in snake-like fashion.
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) is a network of permeable-walled

tubes (14), wherein individual tubes (14) in
said network are connected to other tubes (14) therein.
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) extends within said'

assembly of interconnected fibers (12).
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) extends above said

assembly of interconnected fibers (12).
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) extends below said

assembly of interconnected fibers (12). 
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) includes a plurality

of pores (18), said pores (18) making the walls of said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) permeable and being

provided at preselected intervals along said at least one
permeable-walled tube (14).
A flexible membrane as claimed in claim 1 wherein said at
least one permeable-walled tube (14) is made of a nonporous,

permeable synthetic, polymeric resin.
