<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new series of trifluoromethylbenzene 
derivatives of general formula I having antifungal activity. The invention also 
relates to a process for their preparation, to the pharmaceutical compositions 
containing them and to their use for the manufacture of a medicament for the 
treatment of fungal diseases. European patent application EP 332,387, published September 13, 1989 
(assigned to Sankyo Company Limited) describes, among others, certain 
antifungal compounds of general formula 
wherein:
 
Ar represents a phenyl group optionally substituted by one or two halogen or 
trifluoromethyl groups; R₁ is H or together with R₂ forms an oxazolidine ring; 
R₂ is H, C₁-C₄ alkyl or together with R₁ forms an oxazolidine ring; and p is 0 or 
1. These compounds are useful for the treatment of fungal diseases in animals 
and plants. The above mentioned patent application discloses as preferred 
meanings for the susbtituent Ar a phenyl group substituted by one or two 
halogen atoms, preferably fluorine and/or chlorine. More specifically, EP 
332387 mentions as more preferred meanings for Ar the following groups: 4-chlorophenyl, 
4-fluorophenyl, 2,4-dichlorophenyl, 2,4-difluorophenyl, 2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl 
and 2-fluoro-4-chlorophenyl, of which 2,4-dichlorophenyl, 
2,4-difluorophenyl, and 4-chlorophenyl are most preferred. 
Among these compounds, the compound (4R*,5R*)-5-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-4-methyl-5-[(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]-3-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]oxazolidine 
(hereinafter referred to as compound 4) shows an excellent antifungal 
activity (Chem. Pharm. Bull.,1990, 38, 2476). However, this compound has 
now been found to be toxic at high doses, which severely limits its use in 
treating human mycoses. The present invention relates to a series of compounds of general 
formula Iwherein R₁ represents hydrogen and R₂ represents hydrogen or C₁₋₄ alkyl, or 
R₁ and R₂ together represent a group -(CH₂)-; p is 0 or 1, and the salts and 
solvates thereof. This family of compounds is not specifically disclosed in the 
aforementioned patent application, nor is the 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl 
moiety specifically named as a preferred example of the Ar substituent in their 
general structural formula. In fact, none of the compounds containing a 
trifluoromethyl substituent in the Ar ring had actually been prepared. In an 
exhaustive attempt to reduce the toxicity of this kind of products while 
retaining their activity, we have surprisingly found that the substitution of the
