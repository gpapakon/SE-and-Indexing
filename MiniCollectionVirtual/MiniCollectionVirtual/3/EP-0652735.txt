<ABSTRACT>
An implantable bioartificial pancreas device (1) having an islet chamber (5) containing glucose responsive and insulin-secreting islets of Langerhans or similar hormone secreting cells, the islet chamber (5) having baffle means (60) inside thereof to assist in even distribution of the islets in the chamber, one or more vascularizing chambers (10) open to surrounding tissue, a semi-permeable membrane (25) between the islet and vascularizing chambers that allows passage of small molecules including insulin, oxygen and glucose and does not allow passage of agents of the immune system such as white cells and antibodies, the vascularizing chambers containing a growth factor soaked fibrous or foam matrix (30) having a porosity of about 40 to 95 %, the matrix providing small capillary growth and preventing the blood from clotting in the lower chamber.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLEBIOARTIFICIAL PANCREASFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is directed to a bioartificial implantable pancreas for the treatment of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere is a need to provide a biocompatible and implantable device containing islets of Langerhans, or the beta cells thereof, that can supply the hormone insulin for the purpose of controlling blood glucose levels in people with diabetes mellitus requiring insulin.Insufficient regulation of blood glucose levels in people with diabetes has been associated with the development of long-term health problems such as kidney disease, blindness, coronary artery disease, stroke, and gangrene resulting in amputation. Therefore, there is a need to replace conventional insulin injections with a device that can provide more precise control of blood glucose levels. An implantable bioartificial pancreas device which was evaluated in dogs by Monaco et al. was recently described in the following articles: "Successful treatment of diabetes with the biohybrid artificial pancreas in dogs" Transplantation 51, 43-51, January, 1991; "Biohybrid artificial pancreas: Long-term implantation studies in 

diabetic, pancreatectomized dogs" Science 252, 718-721, May 1991; "Transplantation of islet allografts and xenografts in totally pancreatectomized diabetic dogs using the hybrid artificial pancreas" Ann. Surg. 214 339- 362 September, 1991. The device described in these articles was a chamber containing a coiled copolymer tubular membrane through which and within which blood flowed. The coiled copolymer tubular membrane had a nominal porosity of 80,000 daltons which permit free passage of nutrients and insulin but inhibit passage of the agents of the immune system (immunoisolation) . Surrounding the outside of the coiled tubular membrane and within the chamber were placed islets of Langerhans. The islets of Langerhans are composed primarily of α, β, δ and PP cells which synthesize and secrete the hormones glucagon, insulin, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide respectively. These cells may interact in unknown ways to regulate the level of serum glucose. The islets are not in direct contact with the blood. Blood flow through the coiled tube was achieved by connecting the ends of the coiled tube to standard vascular grafts which were then anastomosed to blood vessels. In this type of device blood physically contacts and flows through the artificial coiled copolymer tubular membrane which comprises the device. The major
