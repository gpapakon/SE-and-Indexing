<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new antibiotics, 
delaminomycins, which have an immunosuppressive activity 
and also have an antibacterial activity and an antineoplastic 
activity. This invention also relates to processes 
for the production of these antibiotics. More particularly, this invention relates to 
delaminomycin A, delaminomycin B, delaminomycin C, 
delaminomycin A2, delaminomycin B2 and delaminomycin C2 
which are the new antibiotics having an immunosuppressive 
activity, an antibacterial activity to Gram-positive 
bacteria and an antineoplastic activity, as well as 
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the delaminomycins. 
This inventions also relates to processes for the production 
of these new antibiotics. Further, this invention 
relates to a pharmaceutical composition, especially an 
immunosuppressant composition which comprises the new 
antibiotic(s) as an active ingredient. Furthermore, 
this invention relates to sulfuric acid esters of delaminomycins 
A2, B2 and C2 or salts thereof. The above-mentioned delaminomycin A, delaminomycin  
 
B, delaminomycin C, delaminomycin A2, delaminomycin B2 
and delaminomycin C2 are the antibiotics which were named 
the antibiotics MJ202-72F3-A, MJ202-72F3-B, MJ202-72F3-C, 
MJ202-72F3-A', MJ202-72F3-B' and MJ202-72F3-C', respectively, 
at the time which we, the present inventors, 
initially succeeded in obtaining these new antibiotics. 
These new antibiotics are described under the laboratory 
designations, MJ202-72F3, in the specification of Japanese 
patent application No. 187403/92 (filed 23 June 1992), 
though the new names of delaminomycins are recently 
employed by us in stead of the names of MJ202-72F3. Hitherto, cyclosporin A, FK506 and spergualins 
etc., are known as the immunosuppressive substances which 
are produced by microorganisms. However, these known 
substances are not fully satisfactory as immunosuppressant. For long years, there occur demands to provide 
a new immunosuppressive substance which is useful for 
transplantation of organs and for therapeutic treatments 
of immuno-defficiency diseases and local inflammations 
and is superior to the known immunosuppressants, and to 
provide a substance which has an excellent antineoplastic 
activity. In an attempt to find out useful substances 
having an immunosuppressive activity in the microbial 
products, we, the present inventors, have isolated a 
number of microorganisms out of naturally occurring 
soils and made extensive researches on the products of 
these microorganisms. As a result,
