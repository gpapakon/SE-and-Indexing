<ABSTRACT>
The laminar article of the invention comprises a mixture of a 
polyolefin matrix with a barrier resin of polyethylene-vinyl alcohol 

copolymer and a compatibilizer selected from an ethylene-ethylenically 
unsaturated carboxylic acid copolymer such as ethylene methacrylic acid or 

ethylene acrylic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, polyethylene vinyl alcohol or 
mixtures thereof. A process is also claimed for preparing a laminar article 

with multiple thin, overlapping layers, comprising preparing a melted 
heterogeneous blend of a polyolefin, an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, 

and the above compatibilizer; extending the body of the melt; and cooling 
the extended body to below the melting point of the polyolefin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to laminar blends of polyolefins and 
ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers which have superior barrier and physical 
properties. Polyolefins have been broadly used as packaging materials for 
foodstuffs and the like because of excellent mechanical strength and 
sanitariness. However, polyolefins disadvantageously permit high 
permeability of gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. As a result, 
foodstuffs cannot be preserved for a long time with use of containers or the 
like formed of polyolefins. Containers and films which are blends or laminates of 
polyolefins and ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymers have been the subject of 
several investigations because this combination of polymers has the 
potential for providing high resistance to permeation by water, oxygen and 
hydrocarbons. U.S. Patent No. 3,975,463 discloses a molded structure having a 
specific multilayer structure and good resistance to gas permeation made 
from (a) 30 to 98% by weight of a crystalline polyolefin, (b) 2 to 70% by 
weight of a saponified product of an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, and 
(c) 0.5 to 15 parts by weight of a thermoplastic polymer containing a 
carbonyl group in the main or side chain. The thermoplastic polymer (c) 
can be a copolymer of maleic anhydride or an acrylic acid grafted 
polyethylene. Prior art laminar articles were found to exhibit significant 
variation in resistance to permeation by hydrocarbons, water and/or oxygen 
and in mechanical strength. Such variations are undesirable in laminar 
structures which are to be used in applications such as containers for 
hydrocarbon fuels and packaging for perishable foodstuffs. In addition, the 
components used in laminar articles to be used as containers for foodstuffs 
often must be approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration or other regulatory authorities. Thus, a need exists to  
 
provide polyolefin/ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer laminar structures 
which will consistently provide optimum barrier properties and mechanical 
strength, and which are approved for use as a container for foodstuffs. The inventive laminar articles consistently exhibit outstanding 
barrier properties toward oxygen have good mechanical properties and are 
suitable for use as food containers. Specifically, the present invention provides a laminar article 
comprising the following: 
(a) a polyolefin; (b) an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer containing about 20-60 mole% of 
ethylene units, said copolymer having a melting point at least about 
5°

<CLAIMS>
A process for manufacturing a laminar, shaped article of 
polymeric materials comprising the steps of: 


(a) establishing a melted, heterogeneous blend of 

(i) polyolefin, 
(ii) a polyethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer containing about 20-60 mole % 
of ethylene units and having a melting point at least about 5°C higher 

than the polyolefin, and 
(iii) a compatibilizer comprising an ethylene-α, β ethylenically unsaturated 
carboxylic acid copolymer, polyethylene vinyl acetate polyethylene vinyl 

alcohol or mixtures thereof. 
(b) extending a body of the melt; and 
(c) cooling the extended body to below the melting point of the polyolefin. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the melted, heterogeneous blend 
is established by heating particles of a combination of the polyolefin and the 

compatibilizer and particles of the polyethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, without 
substantial additional mixing, to a temperature above the melting point of the 

polyethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the melted heterogeneous blend 
is established by heating particles of the polyolefin with particles of a 

combination of the compatibilizer and the polyethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, 
without substantial additional mixing, to a temperature above the melting point 

of the polyethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the polyolefin is polyethylene, 
polypropylene, or polybutylene homopolymers or copolymers, or mixtures 

thereof. 
The process of claim 1 wherein the amount of polyolefin is at 
least about 80 to about 90%, the amount of polyethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer 

is about 2 to about 20%, and the amount of the compatibilizer is about 0.5 to 
about 15% by weight of the mixture of the three components. 
A laminar article comprising 

(a) a polyolefin; 
(b) an polyethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer containing about 20-60 mole % 
ethylene units and having a melting point at least about 5°C higher than the

carboxylic acid copolymer, polyethylene vinyl acetate, polyethylene vinyl 

alcohol or mixtures thereof.

The laminar article of claim 6 wherein the amount of polyolefin 
(a) is about 60 to about 98%, the amount of ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer (b) 

is about 2 to about 20%, and the amount of the compatibilizer (c) is about 0.5 to 
about 15% by weight of the mixture of the three components. 
The laminar article of claim 6 wherein the polyethylene-vinyl

overlapping layers of material.
