<ABSTRACT>
A method for recovering dimethyl naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate 
(DMN) from a mixture of dimethyl 

naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate (DMN) and dimethyl 
terephthalate (DMT), which comprises recrystallizing 

said mixture in a mixed medium of ethylene glycol and 
methanol, said mixed medium containing 10 to 60 % by 

weight of ethylene glycol, and separating precipitated 
dimethyl naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate (DMN).

 
According to this invention, DMN can be recovered with 

high yield from a mixture of DMN and DMT which is 
obtained from depolymerization of a mixed polymer of 

polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate and 
polyethylene terephthalate.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for
recovering dimethyl naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate
(hereinafter abbreviated at times as "DMN") from a
mixture of dimethyl naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylate (DMN)
and dimethyl terephthalate (hereinafter abbreviated at
times as "DMT"). More specifically, this invention
relates to a method for recovering DMN from a mixture
of DMN and DMT which is obtained from depolymerization
of a mixed polymer containing polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
and polyethylene
terephthalate.Among polyalkylene terephthalate-type
polyesters, polyethylene terephthalate has many
excellent characteristics, and is, therefore, used in a
large amount in a variety of fields such as fibers,
films and other molded articles. Further,
polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate is superior
to polyethylene terephthalate in heat resistance and
mechanical properties, and is attracting attention as a
high-performance material for fibers, films and other
molded articles. During the polymerization step of
these polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
or the step of forming them
into yarns, films or other molded articles, defective
products, scraps, etc. are formed. In the step of
recovering the defective products, the scraps, etc.,
said polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate and
polyethylene terephthalate are sometimes mixed with
each other.Further, after the molded articles of
polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate 
are put on the market and
actually used up, they are recovered as waste articles.
At that time, it is generally difficult to separate
polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate
as molded articles, and they
are recovered in the form of a mixture.From the standpoint of not only effective
reuse of resources but also environmental pollution, it
is significant to recover, from a mixed polymer of the
aforesaid polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene-2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate,
their raw materials,
above all, the most expensive naphthalene-2,6-dicarboxylic
acid component.A variety of methods for recovering a
dicarboxylic acid component by depolymerizing a
polyester have been so far known. A method for
recovering a naphthalenedicarboxylic acid component in
particular by depolymerization of polyethylene
naphthalate has been also known. For Example, Japanese
Patent Publication No. 11,381/1975 describes a method
in which a bisglycol ester of naphthalenedicarboxylic
acid is obtained by depolymerizing
