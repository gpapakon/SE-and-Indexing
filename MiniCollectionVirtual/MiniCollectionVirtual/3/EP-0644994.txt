<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a combustion chamber 
for burning fuel with an oxidizer fluid over a wide 
range of fuel flows and, more particularly, to a 
combustion chamber for a gas turbine engine which has 
a pilot zone and a main zone for burning the fuel 
with an acceptable level of unburnt hydrocarbons, 
carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen. An axial flow rotary machine, such as a gas 
turbine engine for an aircraft, includes a 
compression section, a combustion section and a 
turbine section. A flowpath for hot working medium 
gases extends axially through the engine. The 
flowpath for hot gases is generally annular in shape. As the working medium gases are flowed along the 
flowpath, the gases are compressed in the compression 
section causing the temperature and pressure of the 
gases to rise. The hot, pressurized gases are burned 
with fuel in the combustion section to add energy to 
the gases. These gases are expanded through the 
turbine section to produce useful work and thrust. The engine has a rotor assembly in the turbine 
section which is adapted by a rotor disk and blades 
extending outwardly therefrom to receive energy from 
the hot working medium gases. The rotor assembly 
extends to the compression section. The rotor 
assembly has compressor blades extending outwardly 
across the working medium flowpath. The high energy  
 
working medium gases in the turbine section drive the 
rotor assembly about its axis of rotation. The 
compressor blades rotate with the rotor assembly and 
drive the incoming working medium gases rearwardly, 
compressing the gases and imparting a swirl velocity 
to the gases. The combustion section is located between the 
compression section and the turbine section. The 
combustion section includes a diffuser plenum and a 
combustion chamber disposed in the plenum. The 
diffuser plenum receives the hot, swirling gases from 
the compression section. The diffuser plenum reduces 
the velocity of the gases causing the static pressure 
to rise and distributes the working medium gases to 
the combustion chamber. The working medium gases 
entering a conventional aircraft gas turbine engine 
include air which, because of the presence of oxygen, 
provides an oxidizer fluid for the combustion 
chamber. Fuel is mixed with the oxidizer fluid in 
the combustion chamber and burned to add energy to 
the gases. The combustion process is not totally 
efficient causing the production of various emissions 
which are a function of engine power and the 
efficiency of the combustion
