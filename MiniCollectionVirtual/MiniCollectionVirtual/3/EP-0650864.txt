<ABSTRACT>
The raiser (boost cushion) (5b) is mounted so that it can move on the underframe (2) of the seat via two link rods (9a, 9b) which are articulated, at one of their ends, to the underframe (2) and, at their other end, to the rigid support (8b) of the raiser (5b) about an axis (12) of transverse direction situated close to the anterior end of the raiser (5b). The raiser (5b) can move between a position in which it is lower down inside a cavity (7) made between fixed parts of the seat cushion (5) of the seat and a raised and set back position in which the raiser (5b) rests on a fixed part (5a) of the seat cushion (5), in a position adjacent to the backrest (4). The seat additionally includes a means (18) for locking the link rods (9a, 9b) relative to the underframe (2) associated with an operating and unlocking means (20, 29) located beneath the seat cushion (5) of the seat (1).

Seat for a motor vehicle formed by a seating base (5) 
resting on an underframe (2) and a back (4) and 

comprising a lift-up section (5b) to allow the seat 
(1) to be adapted for use by a child, and comprising a 

padded panel (8a), a rigid support (8b) articulated by 
means of rods (9a, 9b) to the underframe (2), and a 

means (18, 19, 20) for locking the rods in relation to 
the underframe (2) disposed at a lower level to that 

of the seating base (5) in order to allow the lift-up 
section (5b) to be displaced manually between a 

lowered position, in which the lift-up section (5b) 
forms a part of the seating base (5) of the seat in 

its arrangement for use by an adult, and a raised 
position moved back towards the seat back (4), in which 

the lift-up section (5b) is locked to form the seating 
base of the seat (1) in its arrangement for use by a 

child, the seating frame (5) having a fixed section 
(5a, 6a, 6b) defining a cavity (7) above the 

underframe (2) at least in the central and rear 
section of the seat (1) in order to receive the lift-up 

section (5b) in its arrangement for use by an 
adult, characterised in that the lift-up section (5b) 

is movably mounted on the underframe (2) solely by 
means of two rods (9a, 9b), which are articulated at 

one of their ends to the underframe (2) and at their 
other end to the support (8b) of the lift-up section 

(5b) around a transverse axis (12) located in the 
vicinity of the rear end of the lift-up section (5b) 

between said lowered position in the interior of the 
cavity (7) and said raised and moved-back position, in 

which the lift-up section (5b) rests on the fixed 
section (5a) of the seating base in a position  

 
adjacent to the seat back (4); and that the means (18, 

19, 20) of locking the rods (9a, 9b) is connected to 
an operating and unlocking means (29) located below 

the fixed section of the seating base (5) and at the 
front of the seating base (5). 
Vehicle seat according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the means (18) for locking the rods (9a, 9b), for 

the assembly of the two rods (9a, 9b), comprises a 
axis (19) for pivoting in a transverse direction in 

relation to the seat (1) rotatably mounted on the 
underframe (2), a push-rod (20) for setting the axis 

(19) in rotation by means of a lever (21); and, for 
each of the rods (9a, 9b), comprises a lever (22) 

integral to the axis (19) at one of its ends and at 
its other end a locking bar (24) inserted into an 

opening (23) passing through a plate (11) integral to 
the seating frame (2), as well as a recess (25) in a 

side section of the rod (9a, 9b) and a spring (26) for 
returning the bar (24) towards an end of the 
opening 
(23) in the locking position of a rod (9a, 9b) by 

inserting the bar (24) into a recess (25). 
Vehicle seat according to Claim 2, characterised in 
that the push rod (20) is disposed in a longitudinal 

direction of the seat (1) and comprises a end integral 
to a push button (29) which is mounted to slide in the 

longitudinal direction of the seat (1) in a guide (27) 
integral to the underframe (2) and returned to the 

front of the seat by a return spring (30). 
Vehicle seat according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that for manual displacement of the 

lift-up section (5b), a tab (13) is fastened to the  
 

rear of the lift-up section (5b) so that it is 
accessible to a user in the arrangement of the seat 

for use by an adult and in the arrangement for use by 
a child. 
Vehicle seat according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a guide bar (16) of a safety
