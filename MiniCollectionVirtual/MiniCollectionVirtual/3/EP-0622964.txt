<ABSTRACT>
Voice-activity detection method for determining the existence of voice signals 
in a telephone signal where can also exist one or two frequency tones comprising 

the steps of: 

computing the value of the ratio, 

 
where Amax corresponds to the maximum value of the received signal during 

a sampling window and E a measure of the energy, 
comparing said computed ratio to a first determined threshold value, 
reporting the existence of a unique tone when said ratio appears to be lower 
than said first threshold value. 
Additionaly, the calculated value is compared to a second threshold value and 
if it appears to be inferior to the latter, there will be reported the existence of 

a dual-tone in the received signal. Conversely, if the ratio is superior to that 
second threshold value, the process will conclude on the existence of some 

voice-activity, assuming the level of the received signal is superior to - 
43 dB. 
Preferably, the determination of the single or dual tone signals comprises the 
steps of: 


computing (201) the value of the energy of the signal, 
processing (201) said received signal to determine the existence of one or two 
tones in said signal,  
applying a second-order or fourth-order autoregressive process in response to 
said determination and performing (203, 208) a first estimation of the 

autoregressive parameters of said received signal, 
performing a digital band-pass filtering operation (205,210) adjusted to the 
result of the estimation of said autoregressive parameters to provide a partial 

elimination of the noise existing on said received signal, 
reapplying (205, 210) a second-order or fourth-order autoregressive process 
in response to said determination and performing a final estimation of the 

autoregressive parameters of said received signal, 
 
computing (206, 211) the values of the frequencies each tone from the value 
of said estimated parameters. 
The first and final second-order autoregressive process are based on the predicting 

function having the z-transfer function: 

and which is associated with a Least Mean Square algorithm continuously 
adapting the parameters of the predictor in a sense allowing the minimizing of 

an error signal. On the other hand, the first and final fourth-order 
autoregressive process are based on the predicting function having the z-transfer 

function:

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to voice detection in the telecommunication
field and particularly to a method and apparatus for
discriminating the voice signals from the numerous call-progress
signals which are conveyed on the telephone links.The detection of some voice-activity appears to be a key
problem for telecommunication engineers since more and more
equipments, ranging from the simpler fax machines to the more
sophisticated voice procession application systems, are likely
to be connected to a common Private Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN).US-A-5,070,526 is an example of a prior art system for analyzing
a digital representation of a signal to detect call progress
signals which are periodic as compared to voice signals which
are of essentially random frequency content within the audible
frequency band. In this system, an analog communication signal
transmitted over a telephone line is converted to digital for a
for storage in the memory of a computer. Segments of the
digital representation of the signal are analyzed to determine
whether or not the signal has uniform frequency components
repeating at regular intervals.EP-A-0 228 096 discloses a method for discriminating among
various signals indicative of progress while making a telephone
connection. A call progress analyzer uses a particular
waveform parameter known as peak factor to aid in the detection
of and the discrimination among single-tone signals, double-tone
signals and speech. Waveform peak factor is measured and
compared with predetermined peak factor ranges for the several 
signal types. Waveform ON and OFF times are combined with the
signal-type determinations to automatically determine the
status of a call.The problem of voice-activity detection is particularly important
in the case of voice-server applications providing the
transmission of an understandable vocal messages from one
system on one side of the telephone line to a human being on
the other side. Two different types of calls can be found in
such systems according the caller. A first type is often
referred to as an "in-coming' call 
which applies to the telephone communications which are initiated by a person
who has dialed the telephone number of a voice-server application, in the case
of mail-order business application for instance. Conversely, in some more sophisticated
systems, the call may also be initiated by the machine which performs
the required dialing operations in order to call a private telephone
subscriber and delivers some vocal messages. The second type of call is
