<ABSTRACT>
A simple arrangement, suitable for automatic production, for fastening stator plates to profile rod-like supporting members (11, 13, 15, 17) of the stator (3) in an electric motor (1) is provided according to the invention in that the outer circumferential face (37) of the stator plates (25) has receiving grooves, which extend in the direction of the axis of the motor, for bearing, in a positively engaging fashion, the U-shaped supporting elements (11, 17), in that the receiving grooves are arranged between stop noses which are constructed to protrude opposite the outer circumferential face of the stator plates (25) and are arranged in pairs one opposite the other, and in that the tips of the stop noses of some laminar plates can be caulked behind stop edges in the supporting elements in order to securely connect the stator plates (25) to the supporting elements (11, 17).
