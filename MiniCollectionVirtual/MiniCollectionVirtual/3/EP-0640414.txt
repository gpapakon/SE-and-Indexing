<ABSTRACT>
A hollow steering shaft (6a) having a good quality 
can be manufactured at a low cost by passing a blank 

tube (16) having a circular cross section through a 
preliminary shaping die (25) and then through a finishing 

shaping die (26). The blank tube (16) which has passed through 
the preliminary shaping die (25) is formed with two kinds 

of convex curve surface portions (39,40) having different 
radii of curvature and arranged continuously, 

circumferentially and alternately. When the blank 
tube (16) passes through the finishing shaping die (26), the 

larger convex curve surface portions (40) are deformed 
into flat portions (41). As a result, a steering shaft (6a) 

having an elliptical cross section is manufactured.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
manufacturing, and an apparatus for manufacturing, a 
hollow shaft. A conventional steering apparatus of a 
vehicle has a structure as shown in Fig. 10, for 
example. A steering shaft 1 is supported only 
rotatably in a steering column 2 supported on a 
vehicle body. A steering wheel (not shown) is fixed 
to the upper end of the steering shaft 1. The 
movement of the steering wheel is transmitted to 
steering gears (not shown) through a universal joint 
3 and a transmission shaft 4. The steering apparatus comprising the 
steering shaft 1 and the steering column 2 of the 
conventional type has a so-called collapsible 
structure which shrinks in its longitudinal direction 
when it receives a shock so that it protects the 
driver at the time of collision. As shown in Fig. 
10, the steering shaft 1, for example, comprises a 
hollow cylindrical lower shaft 5 and a solid upper  
 
shaft 6 connected thereto. Each of the fitting 
portions of both shafts 5 and 6 has an elliptical 
cross section so as to prevent relative rotation 
therebetween. Synthetic resin members 9 are filled 
and solidified in annular grooves 7 formed in the 
outer peripheral surface of the lower portion of the 
upper shaft 6 and through holes 8 formed in the upper 
portion of the lower shaft 5. The synthetic resin 
members 9 prevent axial displacement between the 
shafts 5 and 6 in the normal operation of a vehicle. 
Upon collision, however, they are broken and allow 
the displacement between the shafts 5 and 6 to 
shorten the length of the steering shaft 1. Recently, there have been used more or more 
hollow upper shafts 6a of steering shafts 1, as shown 
in Figs. 11 and 12, in order to make the steering 
shafts light. Each hollow upper shaft 6a is 
manufactured by drawing a cylindrical blank tube 
having a circular cross section. On the upper end 
portion of the upper shaft 6a are formed a spline 
portion 10 and a male screw 11 which engages a nut 
for holding a steering wheel mounted on the spline 
portion 10. The lower half of the upper shaft 6a forms 
a substantially elliptical fitting portion 14 
comprising a pair of arcuate portions 12 and a pair 
of flat portions 13 arranged circumferentially and  
 
alternately. The fitting portion 14 is inserted in a 
fitting portion 15 formed on the upper half of the lower 
shaft 5 (Fig. 10) so that only axial movement between the 
fitting portions 14 and 15 is allowed. The annular 
grooves 7 are formed in the outer peripheral surface of 
the fitting

A method of manufacturing a hollow shaft 
including the steps of pushing part of a blank tube 

(16) having a substantially circular cross section 
through a preliminary die (25) and then through a 

finishing die (26) and forming a tube having a pair of 
cross-sectionally arcuate portions (39) and a pair of 

cross-sectionally flat portions (41), respective ones 
of said arcuate portions (39) and said flat portions 

(41) being arranged alternately around the 
circumference of said tube; 


each of said preliminary die (25) and said 
finishing die (26) comprising i) a respective tapered 

drawing portion (29,34) having an inner periphery 
defining a respective first passageway having a cross-sectional 

area which becomes gradually smaller in a 
direction in which said tube is pushed into each said 

die (25, 26) and ii) a respective land portion (30,35) 
adjacent an end of each said respective tapered 

drawing portion (29), each said land portion (30, 35) 
having an inner periphery defining a respective second 

passageway which has a smaller cross-sectional area 
than the smallest cross-sectional area of the adjacent 

respective first passageway, each said land portion

predetermined shape;
