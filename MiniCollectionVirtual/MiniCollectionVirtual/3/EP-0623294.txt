<ABSTRACT>
An article of sport footwear, in particular a ski 
boot, with a boot shell (1) in which a boot entrance (8) is 

defined for receiving the skier's leg, and with a plate-like 
lug (10) associated with the shell at the location of the 

entrance (8) to provide predetermined conditions of support 
for the skier's leg, wherein the lug (10) is pivotable 

relative to the shell (1) into at least two working 
positions where it presents different portions (10a,b) to 

the entrance (8), thereby varying the support conditions 
provided for the skier's leg accordingly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an article of sport
footwear, in particular a ski boot, having a boot shell
which incorporates a bootleg portion encircling a boot
entrance adapted to receive the user's leg therethrough, the
article comprising a plate-like lug associated with the
shell at the location of the entrance thereof and effective
to provide support conditions for the user's leg, said lug
being pivotable relative to the shell.A ski boot having the above features is known from
FR-A-2506135.It is known to form ski boots with a shell of a
plastics material having a bootleg portion which carries, in
its rearward area, opposite from the shell toe end, a lug
commonly called "spoiler" adapted to provide support for the
calf region of the skier's leg. The spoiler permits to adopt
a proper skiing position.In order to change the supported condition of the
leg to suit a skier's individual morphology, as well as to
meet the skier's own requirements, it is known to provide
spoilers which are adjustable in height. An example of such
technical solutions is described, for instance, in US Patent
5046268 by this Applicant.An adjustable spoiler of that kind does fill even
the most exacting of requirements for adjustability, but
still has a drawback in that its construction is complicated
and only justified for high performance boots. Also, it can
only be fitted to the boot in the rearward area thereof.The underlying technical problem of this invention
is to provide an article of sport footwear, such as a ski
boot, which is conceived both construction- and function-wise
to obviate the drawbacks with which the aforementioned
prior art is beset. This problem is solved, according to the
invention, by an article of sport footwear as claimed in the
appended claims.The invention will now be described with reference
to six preferred applications thereof shown, by way of
example and not of limitation, in the accompanying drawings,
in which:
Figures 1 and 2 are fragmentary perspective views
showing schematically a ski boot according to a first
embodiment of the invention; Figure 3 is a longitudinal section view of a
detail of the ski boot in the preceding Figures;Figures 4 and 5 are fragmentary perspective views
showing schematically a ski boot according to a second
embodiment of the invention;Figures 6 and 7 are fragmentary perspective views
showing schematically a ski boot according to a third
embodiment of the invention;Figures 8 and 9 are fragmentary perspective views
showing schematically a ski boot according to a fourth
embod

<CLAIMS>
An article of sport footwear, in particular a
ski boot, having a boot shell (1) which incorporates a

bootleg portion (6,7) encircling a boot entrance (8) adapted
t o receive the user's leg therethrough, the article

comprising a plate-like lug (10; 23; 36; 51) associated with
the shell at the location of the entrance thereof and

effective to provide support conditions for the user's leg,
said lug being pivotable relative to the shell,

characterized in that said lug has at least two different
portions (10a,b; 23a,b; 36a,b; 51a,b) so formed as to

provide correspondingly different predetermined support
conditions for the user's leg when projecting at the

location of the bootleg entrance, said lug being pivotable
on said shell into at least two respective working

positions where said lug presents to said entrance a
corresponding one of said different portions (10a,b; 23a,b;

36a,b; 51a,b), so that the support conditions afforded can
be changed by rotating said lug into a selected one of said

working positions.
An article of footwear according to Claim 1,
wherein said lug portions (10a,b) presented to the entrance

(8) in said working positions project beyond the entrance
(8) by different amounts.
An article of footwear according to either
Claim 1 or 2, wherein said lug portions (51a,b) presented to

the entrance in said working positions have different
elastic resistance to deformation.
An article of footwear according to Claim 3,
wherein at least one of said lug portions (51a,b) includes

at least one weakening area (53) for decreased elastic
resistance of the corresponding lug portion (51b).
An article of footwear according to one or more
of the preceding claims, wherein said lug (10) is associated

with the boot shell (1) at the location of said bootleg portion. 
An article of footwear according to one or more
of Claims 1 to 4, including a front tongue (41) and wherein

said lug (46) is associated with the boot shell at the
location of said front tongue (41).
An article of footwear according to one or more
of the preceding claims, wherein said lug (10) is pivoted to

said boot shell (1).
An article of footwear according to Claim 7,
wherein two opposite sides (11,12) are defined on said lug

(10) and said lug is pivoted to the boot shell at a location
(13) at unequal distances from said opposite sides.
An article of footwear according to one or more
of Claims 1 to 5, 7 or 8, wherein said lug (10) is

associated with the boot shell at a forward and/or rearward
and/or side portion of said bootleg portion.
An article of footwear according to Claim 6,
wherein said tongue (41) comprises a shield (42) and a pad

(43), said lug (46) being bonded to said shield and
interposed between it and said pad.
An article of footwear according to Claim 10,
wherein said pad (43) extends, with a portion (47) thereof,

beyond the free end of said shield (42), and said lug (46),
when in said at least one working position, acts on said pad

portion (47) in continuation of said shield (42).
