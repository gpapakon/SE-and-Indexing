<ABSTRACT>
A plastics tile (9) is made up of a plurality of discrete plastics pieces (10, 11, 12) which are shaped relative to each other and assembled together to abut edge to edge in lower regions of the pieces and form a recess above each mutually abutting edge of abutting pieces in upper regions of the pieces. The pieces are joined together along said mutually abutting edges below the recesses to form a unitary tile.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to tiles, to a method of 
manufacturing tiles from plastics materials, and to 
equipment for facilitating such manufacture. In particular, although not exclusively, the present 
invention is concerned with the manufacture of plastics 
floor tiles which have a predefined pattern of blocks with 
a wood grain appearance which resemble wooden parquet 
floors. One way of manufacturing such tiles, in the past, has 
been to pre-print each tile with a preset pattern of blocks. 
In this case every tile has exactly the same pattern of 
blocks and it is difficult to make the whole floor resemble 
a natural wooden block parquet floor because it is 
impossible to achieve a random effect. To overcome this 
monotony, one could produce a number of sets of tiles with 
each set of tiles being of the same pattern of blocks as all 
the other sets but with different wood grain effects for 
each set of tiles. Such approaches have been quite 
expensive to produce because of the different sets of 
artwork required to make each tile. Furthermore, it is 
impossible to achieve a totally random effect. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
plastics tile which is made of a number of predetermined 
shaped pieces which are joined together to produce a unitary 
tile. According to one aspect of the present invention there 
is provided a plastics tile comprising a plurality of 
discrete plastics pieces which are shaped relative to each  
 
other and assembled together to abut edge to edge in lower 
regions of the pieces and form a recess above each mutually 
abutting edge of abutting pieces in upper regions of the 
pieces, said pieces being joined together along said 
mutually abutting edges below the recesses to form a unitary 
tile. Preferably the upper regions of the peripheral edge of 
each piece that abuts another piece is provided with a 
chamfer to form V-shaped recesses extending down from the 
top surface of the tile along the mutually abutting edges of 
the pieces, and the pieces are joined together through the 
full depth of the extent of the edges that contact adjoining 
pieces below the bottom of the recesses. Preferably the joins are continuous joins, but they 
could be joined at spots at spaced intervals along the 
edges between mutually abutting pieces. In a preferred embodiment each piece comprises a top 
layer of translucent plastics material, a printed layer and 
a backing layer, and the pieces are joined together through 
the thickness of the backing layer. According to a further
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A plastics tile (9) comprising a plurality of discrete 
plastics pieces (10,11,12) which are shaped relative to each other and 

assembled together to abut edge to edge in lower regions of 
the pieces and form a recess above each mutually abutting 

edge of abutting pieces in upper regions of the pieces, said 
pieces being joined together along said mutually abutting 

edges below the recesses to form a unitary tile. 
A tile (9) according to claim 1, wherein the upper 
regions of the peripheral edge of each piece that abuts 

another piece is provided with a chamfer (20) to form V-shaped 
recesses extending down from the top surface of the tile 

along the mutually abutting edges of the pieces, and the 
pieces (10,11,12) are joined together through the full depth of the 

extent of the edges that contact adjoining pieces below the 
bottom of the recesses. 
A tile according to claim1 or claim 2, wherein said joining 
together is by continuous joins. 
A tile according to claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the pieces (10,11,12) are 
joined together by spot joining the pieces at spaced 

intervals along the edges between mutually abutting pieces. 
A tile according to any one preceding claim, wherein each piece 
comprises a top layer of translucent plastics material (14), a 

printed layer (15) and a backing layer (17), and the pieces are joined 
together only through the thickness of the backing layer. 
A tile according to claim 5, wherein there is a 
coloured layer (16) between the backing layer (17) and the printed 

layer (15). 
A method of manufacturing a tile constructed in 
accordance with claim 1, comprising the steps of cutting a  

 
plurality of complementary shaped pieces (10,11,12) from a sheet of 

plastics material, the pieces having recessed edges in upper 
regions thereof, assembling the pieces to form the precursor 

of a tile of the required shape with abutting edges below 
said recesses between each pair of adjacent pieces, and 

effecting a join at said edges below the bottom of each said 
recess to form a unitary tile. 
A method according to claim 7, wherein the join is 
effected by welding. 
A method according to claim 8, wherein the welding 
step is carried out by dielectric heating of the pieces in 

the vicinity of the join. 
A method according to claim 7, 8 or 9, in which at least 
two sets of at least two pieces (10,11,12) cut from sheet stock are 

used to assemble each unitary tile (9), the pieces of each set 
being 
shaped so that they can be interengaged in a plurality 
of different ways to give the same shaped unitary tile 

whereby to provide a reduced probability of producing two 
tiles of identical appearance from sheet stock of standard 

appearance. 
In a method according to claim 7, 8 or 9, the use of a 
welding jig in which the shaped pieces (10,11,12) are assembled in a 

rimmed base member of the jig and are conjoined by welding 
along mutually abutting edges through dielectric heating of 

25 the pieces between the base member and a top electrode (21), 
which top electrode has projections entering recesses formed 

along said mutually abutting edges. 
A method according to claim 11, in which said 
recesses have a semi-angle greater than 45° and said 

30 projection has a semi-angle of not more than 45°. 
In a method according to claim 11 or claim 12, the use of a 
base member with at least one adjustable rim to close edges  

 
of the pieces together prior to welding. 
A method according to claim 8, wherein the join is 
effected by ultrasonic welding. 
A method according to claim 7, wherein the join is 
effected by adhesive bonding or 

solvent bonding.
