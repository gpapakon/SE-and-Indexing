<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a refrigerator (1) having a body part (2) which bounds a refrigerating space and on which the refrigerator door (3) is articulated, and having shelves (6) which are height-adjustably supported on the side walls (4) of the refrigerator. In order to further develop this refrigerator in such a way that its shelves (6) are supported such that they can be pulled out while retaining the possibility of free height-adjustability, in each case two rails (5) or grooves, parallel to one another and to the opening side of the refrigerator door, are arranged on or in the side walls of the refrigerating space, which rails or grooves are provided at intervals with latching recesses (8) and in which rails or grooves holding pieces (9) capable of being latched in and released from the latching recesses are displaceably guided. The holding pieces (9) are equipped on their mutually facing sides with guide pieces (12) which engage in grooves (15; 16) in the lateral end edges (20) of the shelves (6).
