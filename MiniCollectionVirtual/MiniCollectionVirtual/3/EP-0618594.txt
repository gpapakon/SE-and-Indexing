<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
electronic component having a structure formed by 
elastically interposing an electronic component element 
between a pair of spring terminals, and more particularly, 
to an electronic component having a structure capable of 
preventing accidents caused by the destruction of an 
electronic component element in the case of an abnormality. Fig. 5 is a cross sectional view showing a positive 
temperature coefficient thermistor (hereinafter referred to 
as a PTC) device as one example of known electronic 
components. In a PTC device 1, a PTC element 3 is contained 
in a case 2 made of synthetic resin. The case 2 comprises a 
case body 2a having an opening formed in its upper part and 
a cover member 2b for closing the opening. The PTC element 
3 has a structure in which electrodes 3b and 3c are formed 
on both major surfaces of a plate-shaped thermistor body 3a. Elastic portions 4a and 5a of spring terminals 4 and 5 
are brought into contact with the electrodes 3b and 3c, so 
that the spring terminals 4 and 5 are electrically connected 
to the electrodes 3b and 3c, respectively. The spring  
 
terminals 4 and 5 are not only electrically connected to the 
electrodes 3b and 3c by the elastic portions 4a and 5a but 
also hold the PTC element 3 elastically interposed 
therebetween to put the PTC element 3 in a predetermined 
position in the case 2. In this structure, portions, which 
are respectively brought into contact with the electrodes 3b 
and 3c, of the elastic portions 4a and 5a, that is, contact 
portions 4b and 5b are opposed to each other while being 
separated by the PTC element 3. An example of one of these prior art's components 
can be formed in the PATENT ABSTRACTS of JAPAN, 
vol. 16, no. 294 (E-1225) 29 June 1992 & JP-A-04 078 103 
(MURATA MFG CO LTD) 12 March 1992. In the PTC device 1, however, an abnormal voltage 
exceeding a rated voltage may, in some cases, be applied to 
the PTC element 3 depending on any circumstances. Also, the 
PTC element 3 may, in some cases, be degraded due to, for 
example, the change in the environment. As a result, the 
PTC element 3 is destroyed while it is being used, so that 
PTC element pieces 3A and 3B formed by the destruction may, 
in some cases, be scattered in the case 2. In the conventional PTC device 1, however, the PTC 
element piece 3A remains elastically interposed between the 
spring terminals 4 and 5 even if the PTC element 3 is 
destroyed, as indicated by the PTC element piece 3A shown in 
Fig. 6. That
