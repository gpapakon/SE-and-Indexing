<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a transport rack with a rectangular baseframe which has at its corners angled, vertically arranged plug-in elements with in each case one support element, provided on the underside, for receiving and supporting bearing columns for intermediate floors (8) which can be inserted into supports of the bearing columns by means of supporting arms (6), elongated frame elements being provided between the plug-in elements to form the baseframe. In order to be able to cover the transport surface of the insertion floors (8) completely with European standard containers it is proposed that the columns be formed from an angular profile (2) which is opened towards the intermediate floors (8) and whose one leg (3) has on its inner side arranged distributed over its length at a distance from one another supports for the supporting arms (6) of the insertion floors (8), the plug-in elements being constructed as open angled profile elements which surround at least two outer sides of the columns.

A transporting rack with a rectangular base frame (23), which has at its
comers angular vertically disposed push-in pieces (9) on the underside of

each of which there is a resting piece (22) to receive and support columns (1)
for carrying intermediate shelves (8) which can be fitted into supporting rests

(4,5) in the support columns (1) and onto support arms (6,7), whereby
elongated frame elements are provided between the push-in pieces (9) to form

the base frame (23), the columns (1) being formed from an angled profile
section (2) which is open towards the intermediate shelves (8) and one flange

(3) of which has on its inside face and spaced at intervals over its length
supporting rests (5) for the support arms (6,7) of the intermediate shelves (8),

characterised in that only one flange (3) of the angled profile section (2)
having over its entire length an inwardly directed indentation (17) which has,

at the desired distance apart, apertures (18) for insertion of the support arms
(6,7), the undersurface of each of which forms a supporting rest (5), the push-in

pieces (9) being constructed as open angled profiled members (10)
comprising at least the two outside faces (11,12) of the columns (1).
A transporting rack according to Claim 1, characterised in that the free ends
of the flanges (13) of the angled profiled members (10) forming the push-in

pieces (9) have a narrow projecting area (15,16) bent over inwardly at a right
angle, for each to engage furthermore around an inserted coloumn (1) formed

by the angled profiled section (2).
A transporting rack according to one of Claims 1 to 2, characterised in that
with ale angled profiled section (2) inserted and at a suitable height, at least

one transverse web (19) is disposed at a distance (20) from the further flange 
of the angled profiled section (2) which is at right angles to the first flange (3)

and parallel with the angled profiled section (2), so that a support arm (6,7)
of an intermediate shelf can be placed on each one.
A transporting rack according to one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that
alternating and externally applied markings (21) are associated with all

supporting rests (5) in order to identify supporting rests (5) which are at the
same height.
A transporting rack according to one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that
approximately at half the oppositely disposed elongated frame elements of the

base frame (23) there are in each case two further push-in pieces (9) as
fixings for in each case one further angled profiled section (2).
