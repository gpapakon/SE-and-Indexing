<ABSTRACT>
An adduct of a 2,2'-bis(cyclic vinyl ether) such as 
bis-dihydropyran and a chiral compound that has the formula 


R₁CH(XH)-COOH
wherein R₁ is an inert substituent and X is a heteroatom. 
Such an adduct can be used to prepare an enantiopure acid 

of the formula 

R₁R₂C(XH)-COOH
by reaction with base and then with a corresponding 
electrophile capable of introducing the group R₂, and 

releasing the desired enantiomer from the appropriate 
diastereomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to dihydropyran derivatives, 
and analogues thereof, and their use. 3,3',4,4'-Tetrahydro-6,6'-bis-2H-pyran (abbreviated 
herein as "bis-DHP") is known. It selectively protects 
1,2-diols, to form dispiroketals, and this protection is 
useful for carbohydrates; see Ley etal, Tet. Lett. (1992) 
33: 4767-70, and Synthesis (1992) 52-54. EP-A-0614895 describes ring-substituted derivatives of 
bis-DHP, having C2 symmetry, in single enantiomer form. 
They are useful for the resolution of chiral 1,2-diols or 
related 1,2-difunctional compounds or for the 
desymmetrisation of prochiral 1,2-difunctional compounds, 
e.g. glycerol, or as catalysts. Seebach etal, Tetrahedron 40:1313-1324 (1984), 
describe a synthesis of enantiopure α,α-disubstituted-α-hydroxyacids. It has now been discovered that, as an example of bis-cyclic 
vinyl ethers joined at the respective 2-positions, 
bis-DHP will form dispiroketals from α-substituted 
carboxylic acids, and that stereo-controlled alkylation 
reactions can be performed on the resulting dispiroketals 
to give highly enantioselective syntheses of, for example, 
α-hydroxy acids and α-amino-acids. Scheme 1, in which X is a heteroatom, e.g. -S- or -NZ- 
(wherein Z is an electron-withdrawing group such as acyl or 
sulphonyl) and preferably -O-, shows the relevant 
reactions; R₁ and R₂ are each any substituent which does not 
interfere with the reaction, e.g. alkyl, aryl or aralkyl 
optionally substituted with, say, OH, and are chosen with 
regard to the desired product. Scheme 1 shows the use of bis-DHP (I) by way of 
example only. The same reactions can be conducted using an 
analogous compound which comprises two cyclic vinyl ether  
 
moieties bridged at the C atoms adjacent to the respective 
O atoms. With further reference to Scheme 1, the chirality of 
compound II (R₁≠H) determines the stereochemistry of the 
dispiroketal (III) framework. Following treatment with 
base, alkylation with R₂-Y (an electrophile) then takes 
place to introduce a new alkyl group (R₂) on the equatorial 
face, and throughout the reactions there is a preservation 
of chirality; by this means, for example, (S)-lactic acid 
may be converted into (S)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoic acid, 
or (S)-phenylalanine converted into (R)-α-methylphenylalanine. 
When carrying out the process on 
amino-acids, it may be necessary to stabilise the 
dispiroketal by use of a protecting group on the amino 
function of the amino acid (X = -NZ-). Schemes 2 and 3 show examples of the invention, i.e. 
step
