<ABSTRACT>
A method of inhibiting hirsutism or alopecia 
in women comprising administering to a female human in 

need of treatment an effective amount of a compound 
having the formula 


   wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


or 

wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine, hexamethyleneamino, and piperidino; or a 
pharmaceutically acceptable salt of solvate thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
Hirsutism (hypertrichosis) is characterized by
excessive growth of hair. In women, hirsutism refers
specifically to excessive growth of hair in a male pattern
and distribution. Clinically, hirsutism in women is seen
as a growth of terminal hair on the face (particularly on
the upper lip), the chin, chest, back, and lower abdomen
(escutcheon). This growth of hair is often seen as
unsightly and can be the cause of embarrassment and
psychological distress. Hirsutism is a common occurrence
at the menopause, but can occur any time after puberty.
The etiology of the condition has been linked to over
production of androgens by either the ovaries or adrenal
glands or both.Hirsutsim in women can be treated in a variety
of ways. Cosmetic treatment of the condition, including
shaving, plucking of hairs, and bleaching, while effective
in improving the appearance of the patient, are only
palliative and must be constantly re-applied.
Glucocortacoid steroids are often effective; however, they
have the potential of serious side-effects such as
Cushing's Syndrome. Oral contraceptives can be effective;
however, care must be taken because certain progestins used
in common oral contraceptive regiments may actually
contribute hirsutism because of their androgenic side-effects.
Cimetidine and Spironolactone have shown some
effectiveness in the treatment of hirsutism; however, each
of these can have unwanted side-effects. Clearly, a more
effective and better tolerated agent would be useful.Alopecia (hair loss) can occur in women for a
variety of reasons, and includes female pattern alopecia.
Female pattern alopecia is characterized by chronic and
progressive hair loss often beginning around thirty years
of age and accelerating at menopause. The hair loss is
usually confined to thecentral scalp in a diffuse pattern. 
This loss of hair is cosmetically damaging and often
psychologically disturbing to the patient. The etiology of
the condition has been linked to an elevated level of
androgens and the subsequent response of androgen sensitive
hair follicles. Treatment of the condition is primarily
cosmetic in nature, e. g., wigs, hair styles which cover
the effected area, etc. The drug, Spironolactone, has been
used, but does have side-effects. Clearly, an effective
treatment for this condition would be useful.This invention provides the use of
a compound of formula I
wherein R1 and R3 are independently hydrogen,
-CH3,

wherein Ar is
optionally substituted phenyl;R2 is selected from
pyrrolidino, hexamethyleneimino, and piperidino;
