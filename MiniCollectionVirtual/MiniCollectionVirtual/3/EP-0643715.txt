<DESCRIPTION>
 _PROTECTED PHOSPHONOALKYL PHENYLALANINE COMPOUNDS FOR USE IN PEPTIDE SYNTHESISFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention is concerned .with providing 5 phosphonic acid-containing derivatives of phenylalanine and optically active isomers thereof, which are functionalized in a manner which makes them suitable for facile incorporation into peptides using standard solid-phase or solution-phase techniques.10 BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONSynthesis of 4-phosphonomethyl-DL-phenylalanine (Formula la) , and derivatives thereof (Formulas lb-d) have previously been reported 1-4 (See Table 1) . The purposes of such preparations were to utilize the prepared 4-phosphonomethyl-15 DL-phenylalanines as competitive anta-gonist of N-methyl-D- aspartic acid 2 or as mimics of O-phosphotyrosine 1>3'4. These previously prepared derivatives are not suitable for facile incorporation into peptides or peptide mimetics using standard protocols developed for either solution-phase or solid-phase20 peptide synthesis using "F oc protocols" 5> .Central to peptide synthesis is the protection of reactive functional groups with moieties which are easily removed under conditions which are compatible with the preservation of other functionalities in the peptide. A major25 branch of peptide chemistry has recently evolved using 9- fluorenyl ethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) groups for protection of α- amino groups during coupling reactions of a ino acid monomers into peptide chains. The Fmoc groups are then generally removed by brief treatment with an appropriate base such as30 piperidine. In such reactions, other chemically reactive groups on the amino acid monomers must be protected bySUBSTITUTESHEET 

 functionalities which are stable to the basic conditions utilized to remove Fmoc groups. Traditionally, these other groups were removed by mild acid treatment (e.g. , tri- luoroacetic acid) such as used to cleave the finished peptide from a given resin. The tert-butyl group is used widely inFmoc-bearing residues for the protection of hydroxyl groups, since it is stable to base and easily removed by mild acid treatment. Unlike the present inventive compounds, the prior known 4-phosphonomethyl-DL-phenyl-alanine compounds shown in Table 1 (Compounds la - Id) require significant synthetic manipulation to render them suitable for peptide synthesis.SUBSTITUTESHEET
