<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of concentration
detection and more particularly to the detection of
toner concentration in color liquid developer compositions
especially in the presence of contaminants.In liquid developer systems the liquid developer is
generally comprised of a carrier liquid and toner particles
in a generally constant ratio. During imaging operations the
concentration of toner particles is reduced and concentrated
toner is added to return the concentration to its desired
value.It is important that the concentration of particles
should be kept within a given range in order to realize
consistent copy quality. This requirement is especially
important in color printers or copiers, where the quality of
the images is especially dependent on the color balance and
on its stability.In general, concentration of toner particles in liquid
developers is determined by measuring the attenuation of
light passing through a given path filled with the liquid
developer. Since the particles absorb and scatter light, the
attenuation of the light is related to the concentration of
the particles.U.S. Patent 4,579,253 describes a system in which the
beam of light is split into two components only one of which
is attenuated by the liquid developer. The concentration is
determined from the ratio of the attenuated and unattenuated
beams.Such systems work fairly well in single color systems
or in multicolor systems in which there is no cross contamination
between the colors. In general, the most troublesome
cross-contamination is black toner particles in a relatively
low attenuation color such as yellow. Since black has an
attenuation several times that of yellow, visually
negligible black contamination can effect the determination
of the color concentration in a way which seriously disturbs 
the color balance of the system.Japanese Patent Publication Kokai 1-148943 describes a
system in which the attenuation of beams of light having two
different colors are sequentially measured. Using these
attenuation values, the publication describes a method for
determining the concentration of both the black and the
color particles.US patent 3,724,957 to Tamate describes a system for the measurement of paper
fibers in the presence of clay. The system utilizes the fact that one of the material is optically
active (i.e., it rotates the polarization of light that passes through it) to differentiate between
the materials. There is no teaching of how to perform these measurements for materials that
are not optically
