<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a screwing device with feeding device (1) for screws (4) connected by a strip, a drivable screwing blade (11) is rotatably and displaceably mounted in a bearing body (6). A feeding lever (12) of the feeding device (1) can be actuated by the rotating screwing blade (11) via a pivoting lever (16), in which case the screw strip (3) is displaced in the direction of the screwing blade (11). To feed the screw strip (3), the force of the drive motor (10) is used therefor and the operator is relieved of the hitherto customary tensioning operation.

<CLAIMS>
A screwdriving unit having a conveying device for belted screws (4), having a bearing 
body (6) movable in relation to a guide sleeve (7) and in which a drivable screwdriver 

blade (11) is rotatably and movably mounted, having a guide channel transverse thereto 
for the screw strip, on which strip acts a spring-loaded and swivellable conveying lever 

(12) of said conveying device, 
characterized in that
 said conveying lever 
(12) is actuatable against the spring action by the rotating screwdriver blade (11, 28). 
A screwdriving unit according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said 
conveying lever (12) is actuatable by a swivel lever (16) against the action of a 

tensioning spring (15), where a cam (20, 30) connected to said screwdriver blade (11, 
28) interacts with said swivel lever (16). 
A screwdriving unit according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 a toggle 
lever (18) is provided between said conveying lever (12) and said swivel lever (16). 
A screwdriving unit according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that
 a 
triggering element (21) actuatable by said guide sleeve (7) and interacting with said 

swivel lever (16) is provided for returning said swivel lever (16) to its rest position. 
A screwdriving unit according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in 
that
 a sleeve (29) provided with a cam (30) is movably mounted on said screwdriver
