<ABSTRACT>
Method and system for reading recording media chiefly comprising a crosstalk correcting circuit (5) and crosstalk coefficient estimation circuits (2, 4g, 4d). The estimation circuit (2) calculates from supposedly corrected signals (x-j, xj, xj+1), residual crosstalk coefficients (ej, ed). The coefficient obtained is equal to the product of the value of a track signal (xj) and the signal sign of an adjacent track. Two left and right coefficients (Cjg and Cjd) are thereby obtained. Then the coefficients (ej, ed) are are filtered by filters (4g, 4d) which store the crosstalk coefficients (Cj, Cd) calculated during a preceding operation and update the crosstalk coefficients (Cj, Cd) by a fraction k' of the residual crosstalk coefficients. Applications in reading high density recording media (magnetic or optical).
