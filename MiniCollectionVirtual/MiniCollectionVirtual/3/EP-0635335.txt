<ABSTRACT>
A conformable sanding device incorporating a flexible 
attachment means for ready attachment to a hand or power 

sander means. The sanding device is particularly useful for 
sanding contoured and other non-planar surfaces and angles. 

The sanding device comprises a compressible sanding block, 
said sanding block further comprising peripheral surfaces of 

an abrasive material; and, said sanding block further 
comprising a flexible attachment means. The flexible 

attachment means is designed for ready attachment to, and 
ready removable detachment from, a hand or power sanding 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to sanding devices. The present invention further relates to sanding devices 
incorporating attachment means. The present invention also relates to conformable 
sanding devices, incorporating flexible attachment means, 
designed for ready attachment to and ready removable 
detachment from a hand or power sanding means. It has been a long standing problem in the field of hand 
sanding means to create devices which possess appropriate 
stiffness values, enabling operators to apply even pressure 
and achieve evenly sanded finishes. Another major problem in 
this field of art relates to the manageability of hand 
sanding means in terms of the operators' ability to grip 
them. These seemingly distinct concerns have not been 
simultaneously addressed in any disclosures heretofore 
divulged. The present invention combines solutions to these two 
problems by enhancing stiffness while simultaneously 
providing a unique flexible attachment means. However, a 
sanding device must also be sufficiently elastic, resilient 
and, in particular, conformable if all manner of surfaces, 
non-planar as well as planar, are to be sanded. It is  
 
necessary to provide a sanding device capable of withstanding 
forces and pressures applied to them by their operators 
without compromising the nature of the sanded finish 
achieved. To achieve these goals, the present invention 
employs a compressible medium and incorporates a unique 
flexible attachment means in the middle of the compressible 
sanding block. When employing a sanding device, unevenly applied 
pressure produces an uneven finish. Attempts have been made 
to enhance the stiffness of sanding devices, often at the 
expense of comformability. The present invention addresses 
this two-fold problem by adding an incorporated flexible 
attachment means. Additionally, previous disclosures fail to 
provide a means for one-hundred percent coverage of all types 
of surfaces which require sanding, and there is no suggestion 
in the prior art of incorporating flexible attachment means 
to enhance orbital action or for ready removable attachment. Known sanding blocks recognize the need for sufficient 
stiffness of body and conformability, however, no previous 
disclosures address the problem in the manner which the 
present invention does. The present invention derives both 
its conformability and its unique ease-of-use from the 
incorporated flexible attachment means extending outward and 
oriented co-planar with the upper and lower peripheral  
 
surf
