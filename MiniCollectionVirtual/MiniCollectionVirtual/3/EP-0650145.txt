<ABSTRACT>
The present invention performs an 
interpolation operation between a pair of stereo images to 

produce plural intermediate images. The interpiolation 
operation involves estimating the velocity vector field of 

the intermediate images. The estimation for a particular 
intermediate image includes constraining the search for the 

correspondences between the two images in the horizontal 
direction allowing the system to arrive at a more optimal 

solution. Excessive gap filling by smoothing is not 
necessary. At the same time the process vertically aligns 

the entirety of the images.

<DESCRIPTION>
A microfiche appendix of source code in the 
"C" language having 63 total frames and one total 
microfiche. The microfiche appendix included herewith 
provides source code suitable for implementing an embodiment 
of the present invention on a Sun Microsystem Sparc 10 
computer running the Unix operating system. The present invention relates to a method and 
an apparatus for constructing a depth image from a pair of 
stereo images by interpolating intermediate images and then 
interlacing them into a single image. Producing images that have the perception of 
depth has traditionally been accomplished by photographic 
methods. Integral and lenticular photography have a long 
history of theoretical consideration and demonstration, but 
have only been 
met with limited commercial success. Many of the elementary 
concepts supporting integral and lenticular photography have 
been known for many years (see Takanori Okoshi, 
Three-Dimensional Imaging Techniques, Academic Press, New 
York, 1976; and G. Lippman, "E'preuves re'versibles, 
Photographics integrales," Comptes Rendus, 146, 446-451, 
March 2, 1908). The term integral photography refers to the 
composition of the overall image as an integration of a  
 
large number of microscopically small photographic image 
components. Each photographic image component is viewed 
through a separate small lens usually formed as part of a 
mosaic of identical spherically-curved surfaces embossed or 
otherwise formed onto the front surface of a plastic sheet 
of appropriate thickness. This sheet is subsequently bonded 
or held in close contact with the emulsion layer containing 
the photographic image components. Lenticular photography 
could be considered a special case of integral photography 
where the small lenses are formed as sections of cylinders 
running the full extent of the print area in the vertical 
direction. A recent commercial attempt at a form of 
lenticular photography is the Nimslo camera which is now 
being manufactured by a Hong Kong camera works and sold as a 
Nishika camera. A sense of depth is clearly visible, 
however, the images resulting have limited depth realism and 
appear to jump as the print is rocked or the viewer's 
vantage relative to the print is changed. An optical method of making lenticular 
photographs is described by Okoshi. A photographic camera 
is affixed to a carriage on a slide rail which allows it to 
be translated in a horizontal direction normal to the 
direction of the desired scene. A series of pictures is 
taken where
