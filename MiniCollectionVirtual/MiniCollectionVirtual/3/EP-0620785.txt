<ABSTRACT>
A method of protecting machine-readable markings on the surfaces of articles consisting in applying to the machine-readable markings a thin layer of an amorphous fluoropolymer, which may be, i.a., a copolymer of perfluoro(1,3-dioxole) or of perfluoro(2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxole) with a fluoromonomer selected from a specifically recited group, especially, with tetrafluroethylene; or a cyclic aliphatic homopolymer in which the repeating unit contains an aliphatic ring of 5-9 members, at least two of the ring members being carbon atoms independently substituted either by fluorine atoms or by perfluoromethyl groups, at most two of the ring atoms being oxygen atoms, the remaining portions of the repeating units, when present, being perfluoromethylene groups.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of protecting machine-readable 
markings by means of an optically clear, chemically resistant, and 
mechanically strong coating as well as to articles carrying on their outer 
surfaces machine-readable markings protected by such coating. Machine-readable markings are nowadays routinely placed on 
various objects to provide instant identification of such objects, for example, 
their nature, price, size, or destination. The most commonly used machine-readable 
marking is a bar code system. The bar code marking applied to the 
object is read by a suitable device, which generates a control signal, usually 
electrical, which is sent to a computer or a computer-controlled apparatus 
for taking appropriate action. This may be simply entering the information 
about the object into a database for the purpose of inventory, or directing a 
manufacturing or processing machine to perform a step in a process, or 
directing a car or container to the proper destination. Sometimes, machine-readable 
markings are placed on metal, usually aluminum, tags attached to 
an object, for example, to a piece of plant or laboratory equipment. 
Information stored on those tags may, in addition to simple inventory 
identification, include information about safety or hazards of operation, or 
maintenance requirements. In other cases, machine-readable markings are 
often painted on or otherwise applied to the exterior surfaces of shipping 
containers and railroad freight cars, so that they can be easily identified as to 
ownership, contents, and destination. In many applications where machine-readable markings are 
applied to various objects, the objects themselves are exposed to corrosive 
environment, for example, in plants or laboratories. In other cases, the 
objects may be exposed to adverse atmospheric conditions, for example, 
smog, rain and snow. With time, those markings can become unreadable or 
inaccurate. It, therefore, is desirable to protect machine-readable markings by 
means of a coating that can be readily applied, that is transparent to the 
wavelength used by the contemplated reading device, that is resistant to the  
 
corrosive or adverse atmospheric conditions to which the markings may be 
exposed, and that can be readily cleaned and restored to its original 
appearance without abrasion or other damage. Various protective coatings have been proposed in the past. 
Thus, U.S. Patent 4,600,630 to Quinn et al. proposes a coating of a polymeric 
composition that is curable upon
