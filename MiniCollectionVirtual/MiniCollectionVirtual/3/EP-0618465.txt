<ABSTRACT>
An optical waveguide hose includes a hollow tubular 
cladding (1) made of a material having rubber elasticity 

at the service temperature. The cladding (1) is filled 
with a core fluid (2) having a higher index of refraction 

than the cladding (1) and closed with sealing plugs (3) at 
opposed open ends. The hose is improved in flexibility 

and handling, prevents gas penetration into the core fluid 
(2), maintains transparency at widely varying temperature 

over a long time, and is lightweight and inexpensive.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to optical waveguides
having a fluid core, and more particularly, to an optical
waveguide hose having a fluid core which is designed to
prevent penetration of gas into the core, to help maintain
its function over a wide temperature range and a long period
of time and with good flexibility.Well-known fiber optics include
optical fibers of inorganic glass systems such
as quartz glass and multi - component glass and
optical fibers of plastic systems such as
polymethyl methacrylate and polystyrene. These
are all solid optical fibers wherein both the
core and the cladding are solid materials.
Although these optical fibers have satisfactory
characteristics, they are limited in flexibility
because they are formed from glass or hard 
plastics. Also, when it is desired to increase
the diameter for transmitting a large quantity
of light, a plurality of optical fibers each
having a diameter of about 10 to 1,000 µm must
be bundled. The optical fiber bundle has a
space left among fibers even when fibers are
packed at a possible maximum packing density and
thus has a reduced effective inlet surface area
for receiving light. The bundle is then low in
efficiency and rather expensive.As an alternative to the all-solid optical
fibres, we proposed in
US-A-4,009,382 and US-A-3,814,497
optical waveguide
hoses using a normally-liquid light
transmitting medium. See
also US-A-4927231.
The liquid system optical fiber
includes a cladding in the form of a flexible
hollow tube and a liquid core therein having a
higher index of refraction than the cladding.
Opposite end openings of the cladding are closed
with window members. This allows the fiber to
have a large diameter and a large effective
light-receiving area and the fiber is thus
highly efficient and cost effective.Although the liquid system optical fiber
had excellent features as mentioned above, it 
has the problem that since its stiffness is
provided by a cladding in the form of a flexible
hollow tubular member, gases can penetrate into
the core liquid to lower its transparency due to
a change in the service environment temperature
during a long period of use. This is because
the core is liquid and thus has a higher
coefficient of expansion than the hollow tubular
cladding generally formed of resinous material.
At low temperatures, the volume of the core
liquid is smaller than the interior volume of
the cladding so that the hollow interior of the
cladding is under negative pressure, encouraging
gases to penetrate thereto through the
