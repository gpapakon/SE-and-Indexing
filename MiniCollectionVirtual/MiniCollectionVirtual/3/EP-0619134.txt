<ABSTRACT>
In a mixing apparatus for mixing two or more substances, the substances to be mixed flow along a separation plate (22) which is arranged upstream of the mixing zone (d) and on which are mounted flow-influencing elements. The elements are vortex generators (9) of which a plurality are arranged adjacently transversely to the direction of flow over the width or the periphery of the separation plate (22). A vortex generator (9) has three surfaces over which flow freely passes and which extend in the direction of flow and of which one forms the roof surface (10) and the other two form the side surfaces (11, 13). The side surfaces together enclose the sweepback angle ( alpha ). The roof surface runs at an angle of attack ( THETA ) to the wall (21). By means of the vortex generators, large-scale longitudinal vortices can be generated which make possible rapid controlled mixing of the flowing substances within the shortest possible path.

Mixing appliance for mixing materials which can 
have equal or unequal mass flows, the materials to be 

mixed flowing on both sides and along a separating 
plate (22) arranged upstream of the mixing zone (d) and 

means influencing the flow being applied to both sides 
of the separating plate, 


the means being vortex generators (9) of which a 
plurality are arranged adjacent to one another 

transverse to the flow direction over the width or 
the periphery of the separating plate (22), 
a vortex generator (9) having three surfaces 
around which flow of the same material can take 

place freely, which surfaces extend in the flow 
direction, one of them forming the top surface 

(10) and the two others forming the side surfaces 
(11, 13), 
the side surfaces (11, 13) abutting the same wall 
of the separating plate (22) and enclosing a 

V-angle (α) between them, 
the top surface (10) being in contact, by means of 
an edge (15) extending transverse to the wall of 

the separating plate (22) around which flow 
occurs, with the same wall as the side walls, 
and the longitudinally directed edges (12, 14) of 
the top surface, which abut the longitudinally 

directed edges of the side surfaces protruding 
into the flow duct, extending at an angle of incidence 

() to the wall of the separating plate 
(22). 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the two vortex generator (9) side 

surfaces (11, 13) enclosing the V-angle (α) are 
arranged symmetrically about an axis of symmetry. 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 1, 

characterized in that the two side surfaces (11, 13) 
enclosing the V-angle (α) include between them a 

connecting edge (16) which, together with the  
 

longitudinally directed edges (12, 14) of the top surface 
(10), form [sic]
 a point (18), and in that the 
connecting edge preferably extends at right angles to 

that wall of the separating plate (22) which the side 
surfaces abut. 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the connecting edge (16) and/or 

the longitudinally directed edges (12, 14) of the top 
surface are configured so as to be at least 

approximately sharp. 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the axis of symmetry of the 

vortex generator (9) extends in the flow direction, the 
connecting edge (16) of the two side surfaces (11, 13) 

forming the downstream edge of the vortex generator and 
the edge (15) of the top surface (10) extending 

transverse to the wall around which flow occurs being 
the edge which the flow meets first. 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 3, 
characterized in that the axis of symmetry extends in 

the flow direction, the connecting edge (16) of the two 
side surfaces (11, 13) being the edge which the flow 

meets first, whereas the edge (15), extending 
transverse transverse [sic]
 to the wall around which 
flow occurs, is arranged downstream of the top surface 

(10). 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that the separating plate (22) is 

arranged in a twin-duct containment so as to form two 
annular partial ducts (20', 20''), and in that the same 

number of vortex generators (9) is arranged in the 
peripheral direction in each partial duct, and in that 

the vortex generators are fastened on the separating 
plate (22) in the same axial plane on both sides. 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the ratio of the height (h) of 

the vortex generator to the height (H) of the partial 
duct (20', 20'') is selected in such a way that the  

 
vortex generated fills the complete partial duct height 

or the complete height of the duct part associated with 
the vortex generator immediately downstream of the 

vortex generator. 
Mixing appliance according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that the vortex generators (9), of two 

adjacent partial ducts, arranged on the separating 
plate (22) are offset relative to one another by half a 

pitch.
