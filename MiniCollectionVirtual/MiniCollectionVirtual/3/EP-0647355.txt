<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, in the production of a semiconductor storage device with stacked capacitor above bit line storage cells, use is made of a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process in which at least the transistor-capacitor contact pillars (9) are produced using one CMP step and there is an overall planarised surface before the bit line (10) is produced. Further CMP steps are applied preferably in the production of the transistor-bit line contact pillar (8) of a bit line (10) embedded in a groove and the lower capacitor plate (11) and for the overall planarisation of the cell field and periphery before the circuit is wired.
