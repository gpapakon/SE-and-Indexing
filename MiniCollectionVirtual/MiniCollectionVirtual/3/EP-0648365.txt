<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are a method and apparatus for analyzing an input vocal signal to produce a plurality of harmony signals that are combined with the input vocal signal to produce a multivoice signal. The method makes a current estimate of the fundamental frequency of the input vocal signal and determines if the current estimate is the correct estimate of the fundamental frequency. If the current estimate is correct, a reference note is assigned to correspond to the current estimate and a plurality of harmony notes are selected to correspond to the reference note. The method then generates a plurality of harmony signals by scaling the input vocal signal with a piecewise linear approximation of a Hanning window to extract a portion of the input vocal signal and by replicating the extracted portion at a plurality of rates equal to the fundamental frequencies of each of the harmony notes. The plurality of harmony signals and the input vocal signal are combined to produce the multivoice signal. The steps of the method are carried out with a microprocessor and a signal processing circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for 
generating musical harmonies and, in particular, to an apparatus and method for 
generating vocal harmonies. Musical harmony generators are machines that operate to produce a set of 
harmony signals that correspond to a given musical input signal. With such a 
machine, a musician can play a melody line while the machine generates the 
harmony lines, thereby allowing one musician to sound like several. Harmony 
generators that work with signals from musical instruments, such as guitars or 
synthesizers, have been well known for many years. Such devices generally 
operate by sampling an input signal and shifting its frequency to generate the 
harmonies. In a periodic musical signal, there is always a fundamental frequency that 
determines the particular pitch of the signal as well as numerous harmonics, which 
provide character to the musical signal. It is the particular combination of the 
harmonic frequencies with the fundamental frequency that make, for example, a 
guitar and a violin playing the same note sound different from one another. In a 
musical instrument such as a guitar, flute, saxophone, or a keyboard, as the pitch 
of a note varies, the spectral envelope of the fundamental frequency and the 
harmonics expand or contract as the pitch is shifted up or down. Therefore, for 
musical instruments one can create harmony notes by sampling sound from the 
instrument and playing the sampled sound back at a rate either faster or slower, 
without the harmony notes sounding artificial. Although this method of 
generating harmonies works for musical instruments, it does not work well for 
generating vocal harmonies.  
 In a vocal signal, there is typically a fundamental frequency that 
determines the pitch of a note an individual is singing, as well as a set of 
harmonic frequencies that add character and timbre to the note. In 
contrast with a musical instrument, as the pitch of a vocal signal varies, 
the spectral envelope of the harmonics retains the same shape but the 
individual frequencies that make up the spectral envelope may change in 
magnitude. Therefore, generating harmony signals for the voice, by 
sampling a note as it is sung and varying its frequency, does not sound 
natural, because that method varies the shape of the spectral envelope. In 
order to generate harmony notes for a vocal signal, a method is required 
for varying the frequency of the fundamental, while maintaining the 
overall shape of the spectral
