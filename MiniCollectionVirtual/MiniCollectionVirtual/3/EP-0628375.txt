manufactured of, for example, aluminum alloy. The YAG laser 
welding is conducted by any one of (a) emitting one pulse of 

a YAG laser onto the panel assembly (1) to laser-weld the 
panel assembly (1) in the manner of spot welding, (b) 

providing an outer panel (1a) having a slit (11) between 
portions of the outer panel (1a) where weld beads (3A) are 

formed, (c) laser-welding the panel assembly (1) using a 
first YAG laser having a first laser output and a second YAG 

laser having a second, lower laser output intermittently 
along a welding schedule line (L), and (d) laser-welding the 

panel assembly (1) on a line (S) of the panel assembly 

increased in bending rigidity due to a hemming curvature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laser welding
method which can be used for laser-welding aluminum alloy
parts.As one example of manufacturing automobile parts
of aluminum alloy, the manufacture of aluminum alloy
automobile hoods is taken. In the manufacture, an inner
panel having a peripheral portion and an outer panel having
a hemmed portion are welded at the hemmed portion. If a
conventional pressure-type spot welding is applied, the
hemmed portion will be seriously deformed under the
pressurizing forces from welding tips. This means that it
is not desirable to use the conventional spot welding for
welding aluminum alloy parts. In place of conventional spot
welding, MIG welding or TIG welding could be used. However,
because the thermal conductivity and the thermal expansion
rate of the aluminum alloy are much greater than those of
steel, relatively large deformations will be generated in
the weld deposits and the heat-affected zone, and will need
repair after welding.To suppress deformation, the utility of laser
welding of aluminum alloy parts is being investigated. For
example, Publication, "NIKKEI MECHANICAL" published on May 
3, 1993 from NIKKEI BP Company Ltd. discloses the application of laser welding to
automobile hoods. In the laser welding, a Yttrium-Aluminium -Garnet (hereinafter, YAG)
laser is used and is transmitted from a laser generator to a laser torch via optical fibres. The
laser torch is moved along a welding schedule line to make intermittent weld beads each
having a length of about 20mm. The reason for using a YAG laser is that a YAG laser has
a wave length of 1.06 micron and is almost not absorbed by the optical fibres constructed
of SiO2.However, with the above-described intermittent weld beads there is a problem that
the thermal expansion and shrinkage caused in the weld beads and heat-affected zone
thereof are relatively large so that relatively large deformations are still caused in the
welding portion of the parts.US Patent No: 4,607,150 describes an industrial robot that carries a portable laser
welder on its movable end effector. The welder has a hollow compression tube that is
axially movable against an anvil to hold a plurality of work-pieces together during welding.
The laser beam is brought through the tube from a remote laser generator by means of a
light pipe system.An object of the invention is to provide a laser welding method which can suppress
deformation or distortion generated in a panel assembly during laser-welding.The invention provides a laser welding
