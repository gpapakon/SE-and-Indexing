<ABSTRACT>
Telecommunications network such as PON-FITL-Systems are known with 
a TDMA frame structure comprising a main station (2) and a number of substations (4 

to 7). Due to increased capacity demands and still further service demands, there is a 
tendency for increasing bit rates over such networks. A high bit rate PON is disclosed 

fulfilling such demands, in which the substations are hardly more complicated than 
substations coupled to lower bit rate PONs. This is achieved by forming sub-frames in 

the main station with data for a number of substations and by bit interleaving these sub-frames 
onto the fibre cable. The substations are arranged only to listen to sub-frames 

intended for them. In an advantageous embodiment the substations are automatically 
adjusted for listening to a particular phase in the interleaved bitstream on the basis of 

phase adjustment data transmitted by then main station to the substations via a 
housekeeping time slot.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a telecommunications network comprising
a main station and a plurality of substations, in which network communication between
the main station and the substations occurs in a data-frame with a predetermined bit rate
via a transmission channel on the basis of a multiple access protocol, which channel is
at least partially common to the substations. Such a telecommunications network can be
a passive optical network.The present invention further relates to a main station for use in such a
network.The present invention further relates to a substation for use in such a
system.A telecommunications network of this kind is known from the article,
"The provision of telephony over passive optical networks", C.E. Hoppitt and D.E.A.
Clarke, Br. Telecom Technol. Journal, Vol. 7, No. 2, April 1989, pp. 100-114,
in
which a TPON (Telephony on a Passive Optical Network) is disclosed comprising a
head-end station or exchange termination as a main station, broadcasting TDMA (Time
Division Multiple Access) frames to a number of terminations on an optical
transmission channel or glass fibre in a downstream direction. A single fibre is fed from
the exchange and fanned out via passive optical splitters at a cabinet and distribution
point positions to feed to the terminations. In an upstream direction, each termination
transmits data in a predetermined time slot and the data from the different terminations
interleave at the head-end into a TDMA frame of a predetermined format. Several
variants of terminations are described, such as "House terminations" (fibre-to-the
home)
for individual subscribers, "Business terminations" (fibre-to-the-building)
for small
business customers having a number of subscriber lines coupled to the termination, or
"Street TPON termination" (fibre-to-the-curb), the latter being quite similar to the
"Business termination" apart from the fact that "copper lines" are fed to individual 
subscribers. Such a network is generally referred to as a BTS (Bit Transport System),
the exchange termination being referred to as a BTS-Master and the terminations being
referred to as ONUs (Optical Network Units). In known optical network the bit rate
typically is 20.48 Mbit/s, or 20 Mbit/s for short. Such a network capacity is suitable for
transporting 8 interleaved 2 Mbit/s streams, e.g. each stream transporting 30 speech
channels of 64 kbit/s. Apart from speech data or other subscriber data the 20 Mbit/s
datastream comprises overhead data for controlling purposes, such as housekeeping
