<ABSTRACT>
By forming a grid of grooves (12) in one side of a slab (10) of 
natural stone (marble, granite, porphyry) or conglomerate material and 

anchoring therein a linear reinforcing member (16) made of metal, 
organic fibre or inorganic fibre, said anchoring being achieved by means 

of an organic or inorganic binder (20), the resistance of the slab (10) 
to bending and fragmentation is increased.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel products made from natural stone
or conglomerates of stone or ceramic material, in particular in the form
of reinforced slabs for floors and linings in the building sector.In the description below, "natural stone" is understood as meaning
granite, marble, porphyry, or a material which is used for floors and for
lining the interior and in particular the exterior of buildings. The
term "conglomerate" on the other hand is understood as meaning products
made from mixtures of particles of stone or ceramic material and an
inorganic or organic binder, which are hardened using the processes known
in the art.In the case of the abovementioned applications, namely floors and
linings, the abovementioned materials are used in the form of thin slabs
having dimensions which are as large as possible.These slabs give rise to a few problems and drawbacks of a mechanical
nature, namely poor bending strength and fragility under exceptional
loads.These drawbacks or defects of the slabs in question are of critical
importance in certain applications.In the case of so-called suspended floors, i.e. those floors where a
cavity is provided between the reinforced concrete base and the slab, for
example in order to house the components of electrical and telephone
installations and the piping of heating systems (as occurs particularly
frequently in environments intended for offices and commercial or
industrial use), the poor bending strength means that the slabs must have
small dimensions.In the case of internal and external building linings, on the other hand,
the poor resistance to loads and exceptional stresses, as may occur in
the case of earthquakes and gales, and hence the fragility of the slabs,
may result in the breaking-off of fragments from the slabs themselves,
with serious risks for people and property.In the past, measures have been suggested for overcoming these problems
and drawbacks, but all of the solutions proposed involved solely 
synthetic materials, albeit based on particles of stone material, and
consisted substantially in embedding reinforcing members in the synthetic
material, in the same way as when concrete products are reinforced.
The Belgian patent BE-A-413.816 discloses means to render less slippery
the road surface and, with particular reference to wooden road surfaces,
it consists in realizing in the upper surface grooves to be filled with
an anti-slippery material.No reinforcing property is even remotely suggested as regards the road
construction.The British

<CLAIMS>
Slab-like product of natural, stone or conglomerate material,
consisting of a slab (10) having, in use, a front surface (14) and a rear surface

(22), wherein the rear surface (22) contains a plurality of
grooves (12) each having a depth sufficient for housing therein a linear

reinforcing member (18), but such as to leave a residual thickness behind
the front surface (14), said reinforcing member being permanently anchored

within the grooves, by a binding material (20). 
Product according to Claim 1, characterized in that said slab (10) consists
of a natural stone chosen from marble, porphyry and granite.
Product according to Claim 1, characterized in that said plurality of
grooves (12) forms a regular grid (16).
Product according to Claim 1, characterized in that said linear
reinforcing member (18) is chosen from fibres, cords, strands or a meshwork

lattice.
Product according to Claim 4, characterized in that said linear
reinforcing member (18) is made of a material chosen from metal materials or

inorganic or organic fibres.
Product according to Claim 5, characterized in that said metal material
is steel.
Product according to Claim 5, characterized in that said
fibres consist of carbon or Kevlar.
Product according to Claim 1, characterized in that said binder (20) is
chosen from either organic binders which can be anchored to natural stone or

cement.
Product according to Claim 8, characterized in that said organic binder (20)
is chosen from polyester resins and epoxy resins.
Product according to Claim 8, characterized in that said cement is of
the anti-shrinkage type.
Product according to Claim 1, characterized in that the depth of each
said groove (12) is not less than half of the thickness of said slab (10).
Product according to Claim 1, characterized in that each groove (12) has a
predetermined inclination with respect to the outer surface of the slab

in which said grooves are formed. 
Product according to Claim 1, characterized in that said linear
reinforcing members (18) have associated therewith lugs (28) projecting from the

surface of the slab (10) in which said grooves (12) are formed, said lugs (28)
protruding by a predetermined height for anchoring the product in a

cement base or to a supporting structure.
Product according to Claim 13, characterized in that associated with
said lugs (28) are plate-shaped members (30) provided with holes (32) for anchoring the

product in a laying mortar or in a supporting structure.
