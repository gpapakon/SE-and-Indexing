<ABSTRACT>
In a circular saw (1) of slide compound design, 
typically comprising a base (2) designed to stand 

freely on a bench, with a supporting structure (3) 
mounted to the base (2) and carrying a power-driven 

saw blade (4), the base consists in a plinth (5) 
surmounted by and supporting a table (6) and two 

sliding rests (7) on which work (8) is positioned 
for cutting. The connection between the components 

is such that the table (6) can be rotated about an 
axis perpendicular to the plinth (5) between two 

limit positions, while the rests (7) are disposed 
mutually parallel one on either side of the table 

and slidable longitudinally along their own axes; 
the table (6) affords a longitudinal slot (14) to 

receive the blade, and is connected mechanically to 
the rests in such a way that one rest (7) at least 

will retract when the table is rotated towards it.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention falls within the art field of 
portable or transportable power cutting tools, and 
relates to a circular saw capable of making cross, 
mitre, bevel and compound cuts. The cutting tool of 
such machines consists in a circular blade rigidly 
and interchangeably associated with the spindle of 
a motor, typically electric, by which it is set in 
rotation. The motor and the blade form part of an 
assembly referred to as the saw head. The prior art embraces circular saws with compound 
cutting capabilities suitable for metals or wood, 
which are also portable, i.e. such as can be taken 
with ease onto construction sites, in particular, 
or at all events used in locations other than those 
equipped with permanently installed machines, where 
the need exists for materials to be cut to shape. A circular saw of this type consists in a base or 
frame, designed to stand on a bench or work-top, 
which supports both the saw head and the work and 
affords a perpendicular fence against which the  
 
workpiece is positioned and checked during the cut. The base affords an integrally incorporated recess 
of circular shape freely accommodating a matching 
circular plate by which the saw head is supported, 
in the manner typical of cross-cut machines. More 
exactly, the saw head is mounted to a supporting 
structure associated with the circular plate by way 
of a cylindrical hinge, and rotatable thus about a 
horizontal axis down onto the work to make a cross 
cut, then upwards and away from the work toward an 
at-rest position. The cylindrical hinge in its turn 
is anchored to the circular plate by way of a short 
column, mounted pivotably and in such a manner that 
the saw head can also be rotated together with the 
supporting structure about a second horizontal axis 
perpendicular to the hinge axis, and the blade thus 
tilted from the vertical. In addition, extra cross-cutting width is obtained 
by mounting the saw head supporting structure to a 
slide, capable of movement allowed by guide rods 
disposed transversely to the axis of the base and 
carried by the components of the cylindrical hinge. Accordingly, besides lifting and tilting, the saw 
head is able to slide on the rods transversely to 
the work, moving between a retracted position and  
 
an extended position. With this additional linear 
movement, the saw is able to cross-cut work wider 
than would be possible with angular movement alone. The circular plate performs a role of particular 
importance in correct use of the saw by providing

<CLAIMS>
A portable circular saw of the slide compound type, 
comprising a base (2), and a saw head (41) equipped 

with a motorized circular saw blade (4) mounted to 

a support assembly (3) pivotably associated with a 
table (6) forming a part of the base (2), wherein 

the saw head (41) is rotatable together with the 
table (6) about a vertical axis, pivotable toward 

and away from the table at least about a horizontal 
axis, and slidable horizontally in relation to the 

table between two limit positions, 
characterized 


in that the base (2) comprises a plinth (5), surmounted 
by a table (6) of substantially rectangular 

embodiment and by two sliding rests (7) disposed 
within the same plane as that occupied by the table 

and positioned to support the work (8); 
in that the table (6) and the sliding rests (7) 
are supported by and connected to the plinth (5) in 

such a way that the table (6) is rotatable between 
two angular limit positions about a vertical axis 

 
perpendicular to the plinth (5), with the two 

sliding rests (7) disposed one on either side of 
the table (6) and capable of linear movement along 

their respective longitudinal axes; 
in that the table (6) affords a longitudinally 
disposed slot (14) positioned to coincide with the 

plane occupied by and accommodating the horizontal 
sliding movement of the circular saw blade (4); 

and, 
in that the table (6) and the sliding rests (7) 
are connected one to another by mechanical means 

(9) arranged in such a way that a rotation of the 
table (6) induces retraction of the rest (7) toward 

which the table is directed and extension of the 
remaining rest (7). 
A circular saw as in claim 1, wherein the table (6) 
exhibits a substantially rectangular appearance and 

is flanked on either side by two sliding rests (7) 
likewise substantially rectangular in appearance, 

each of which affords a face (10) located at the 
end toward which the rotating table (6) is directed 

and functioning as a stop by means of which to 
limit the movement of the table. 
A circular saw as in claim 1, wherein the table (6) 
is rigidly associated with a bearing pivot (11) 

passing through the plinth (5) and coupled to the 
mechanical connection means (9). 
A circular saw as in claim 3, wherein mechanical 
connection means (9) consist in a gear wheel (12) 

rigidly associated with the bearing pivot (11) and 
a pair of racks (13) rigidly associated with the 

sliding rests (7) and engaged in meshing contact 
with the gear wheel (12). 
A circular saw as in claim 4, wherein the gear 
wheel (12) and the racks (13) are positioned above 

the plinth (5). 
A circular saw as in claim 3, wherein mechanical 
connection means (9) consist in two sector gears 

(15) secured to or integral with opposite sides of 
the table (6), and a pair of racks (13) rigidly 

associated with the sliding rests (7) and engaged 
in meshing contact each with a respective sector 

gear (15). 
A circular saw as in claim 4, wherein the gear 
wheel (12) and the racks (13) are housed internally 

of a plinth (5) of hollow embodiment. 
A circular saw as in claim 7, wherein the gear 
wheel (12) consists in a bevel wheel keyed to the 

bottom end of the bearing pivot (11), and the two 
racks (13) are embodied each as an integral part of 

the respective sliding rest (7) projecting downward 
internally of a relative longitudinal seating (23), 

afforded by the plinth (5), of which the bottom is 
open at least in part to admit a gear (24) engaged 

in meshing contact with the rack (13) and connected 
mechanically to the bevel wheel (12).
