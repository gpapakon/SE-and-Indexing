<ABSTRACT>
A skin adhesive hydrogel formed by mixing in aqueous medium: (A) major proportion of a high molecular weight water-soluble polyvinylpyrrolidone having ring opened pyrrolidone groups and (B) a minor proportion of a water-soluble multifunctional amine-containing polymer to form a water insoluble, water swellable cross-linked salt between carboxyl groups of the ring opened pyrrolidone groups and basic amine groups of the polyfunctional amine-containing polymer. The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of a plasticizer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to skin adhesive hydrogel
compositions based on a cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone,
for use on animal bodies, particularly human bodies.
Examples of such uses include surgical drapes, wound and
burn dressings and packings, bandages, plasters, transdermal
and iontophoresis drug delivery systems, antimicrobial
barriers for catheter hubs, ostomy products, electrodes,
face masks and nail wraps. The invention also relates to the
method of making the hydrogel composition and to medical and
cosmetic systems comprising the hydrogel composition.The use of cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone hydrogel
as an adhesive in one or more of the foregoing applications
is known. The principal means of cross-linking the
polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) has been by ionizing radiation.
Typical United States Patents directed to this are:
4,646,730 to Schonfeld etal; 4,750,482 to Sleverding, and
3,545,230 to Morse. Chemically cross-linked PVP and
copolymers of PVP and other materials are also disclosed for
one or more of the aforementioned applications in, for
example, the following U.S. Patents: 3,759,880 to Hoffmann
etal.; 3,878,175 to Steckler; 3,336,129 to Herrett etal.;
4,094,822 to Kater, 3,993,049 to Kater, and 4,498,896 to
Heinecke.US Patent 5,156,601 to Lorenz et al discloses a
dressing comprising a stable tacky hydrophilic gel which
comprises a blend of polyurethane (used in water-dispersed
form) and a hydrophilic poly (N-vinyl lactam) (such as ring-opened
polyvinyl pyrrolidone) having a K value calculated
according to Fikentscher's formula of at least about 60 and
above about 1.4 mole equivalents of available acid groups
per mole of poly (N-vinyl lactam). Whilst Lorenz et al do
not intend to be bound by theory, they believe that the
formation of the gel is caused by pervasive and tight
hydrogen bonds between chains and that the presence of the
ring-opened pyrrolidone plays an imperative role in some
undetermined way.British Patent Application No. 2,073,758 discloses
compositions useful as pressure-sensitive adhesives 
comprising an optically clear blend of a water-soluble
polymer of an N-vinyl lactam and a tacky water-insoluble
copolymer of an acrylic or methacrylic acid ester or mixture
of esters, an ethylenic monomer containing an acid group and
optionally another comonomer. There is no disclosure that
the tacky water-insoluble copolymer may contain functional
groups other than acid groups.It is the principal object of the present invention to
provide an improved skin adhesive hydrogel
