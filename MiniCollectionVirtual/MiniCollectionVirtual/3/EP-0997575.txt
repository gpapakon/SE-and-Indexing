<ABSTRACT>
Natural fibers whose surfaces have been plated with titanium oxide.
Scoured wool is immersed in a solution of acetic anhydride (10 weight %) in

DMF (90 weight %). The solution containing the wool is heated to 50 °C and
kept at this temperature for 30 minutes to make the wool anionic. This wool

is washed in water and then immersed in a 2.0 % owf aqueous solution of at
least either of a titanium alkoxide and titanium fluoride at ordinary

temperature for 30 minutes. Subsequently, a 0.5/l/l (by weight) mixture of
boric acid, cirtric acid, and D, L-malic acid is added to the aqueous solution in

an amount of 0.5 owf. The wool is thus treated at 50 °C for 30 minutes and
then washed in water. Thus, natural fibers whose surfaces have been plated

with titanium oxide can be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a natural organic fiber containing titanium
oxide having various functions such as a deodorizing function, a stain
resisting (stain proofing or stain releasing) function, an antibacterial function,
and the like, by a photo-catalytic action of titanium oxide, and to a process for
producing the same.From GB-A-391 773 a process for the fixation of insoluble
metal compounds on textile materials is known with which the
materials are treated with an aqueous liquid containing reagents
which interact with slow formation of the desired compound wherein
the insoluble compound can be titanium oxide or hydroxide.
The insoluble metal oxides or hydroxides are slowly liberated
from aqueous treatment liquids prepared with metal salts and
either neutral bases or salts of strong bases with weak acids.It conventionally has been known that titanium oxide has a photo-catalytic
action and thereby decomposes organic matters. The mechanism of
decomposing organic matters by the photo-catalytic action can be explained as
follows. More specifically, when titanium oxide is irradiated with light beam
such as visible radiation, ultraviolet rays, and the like, charge separation
occurs so as to generate electrons and highly oxidizable electron holes. The
electron holes react with water vapor or oxygen in the air to generate reaction
active species such as OH radicals, O2-, etc. Such reaction active species
instantaneously decompose organic matters existing around them. At
present, titanium oxide is used for the purpose of environmental clean-up, for
example, a deodorizing purpose, stain resisting purpose, an antibacterial
purpose, etc. by using the photo-catalytic action.However, when titanium oxide is used in a field of fibers, there are the
following problems. First, since titanium oxide is provided in a form of
powder, it can be mixed and added to the interior of synthetic fibers.
However, since there is no effective method for attaching titanium oxide to
natural fibers such as wool, cotton, etc., it has been difficult to attach titanium
oxide to natural fibers. Furthermore, even if titanium oxide is attached to
natural fibers by some means, the portion of the natural fiber to which
titanium oxide is attached is deteriorated by the strong photo-catalytic action
of titanium oxide and titanium oxide is easily peeled off. Moreover, as
mentioned above, titanium oxide is activated only when ultraviolet rays are
present in light to some extent, therefore titanium oxide does not exhibit a  
sufficient
