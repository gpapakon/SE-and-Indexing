<ABSTRACT>
A termite-proofing agent containing at least either a compound represented by general formula [I] or a salt thereof as the 

active ingredient, wherein R₁ represents pyridyl, pyrazinyl or thiazolyl each of which may be substituted; R₂ represents hydrogen, 
optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or alkoxy; R₃ represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl; and R₄ represents 

cyano or nitro.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a termiticide comprising a amine 
derivative represented by general formula [I] as shown below or a salt 
thereof as the active ingredient. Many types of termiticide, such as organochlorine compounds, 
organophosphorous compounds, carbamate compounds, etc., have been used 
for the control of termites in the past, however, most of those 
termiticide have not been always satisfied in terms of their 
insufficient effectiveness and/or their high toxic property. Therefore, 
the development of novel termiticide which has less disadvantages as 
described above and is highly safe to human beings, has been intensively 
demanded. It is an object of the present invention to provide a termiticide 
having firm effectiveness and capable of using it safely. The present invention is a termiticide containing at least either a 
compound represented by the general formula [I]; 
wherein R₁ represents optionally substituted pyridyl, optionally 
substituted pyrazinyl or optionally substituted thiazolyl; R₂ 
represents hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or 
alkoxy; R₃ represents hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl; and R₄ 
represents cyano or nitro, or a salt thereof as the active ingredient. For the examples of the amine derivatives of the invention  
 
represented by the general formula [I], there are recited several 
compounds in Table 1. The manufacturing process of the amine 
derivatives represented by the general formula [I] and the salts thereof, 
and the use of those as insecticides is disclosed in WO91/04965.  It is possible to control Isopterous insects such as termites, 
including Coptotermes formosanus Shiraki, Reticulitermes speratus Kolbe, 
Cryptotermes domesticus Haviland, Incisitermes minor Hagen, 
Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, etc. by applying the amine derivative 
represented by the general formula [I] or the salt thereof against such 
termites. The termiticide according to the present invention comprises a 
compound represented by the general formula [I] or the salt thereof as 
the active ingredient. The compound as the active ingredient can be 
applied without being subject to the formulation, however, it is 
normally used in the typical applicable form for this sort of agents, 
such as wettable powder, water soluble powder, dust formulation, 
emulsifiable concentrate, liquid, granular formulation, flowable 
formulation, paste, aerosol, fumigant and smoking generator. For 
additives and carriers, if solid formulations are required, plant-origin
