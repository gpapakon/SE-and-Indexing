<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass composition 
which has a high ultraviolet ray absorbing ability and a 
relatively high luminous transmittance and which has the 
same brown color as current colored plate and float glass 
for buildings and vehicles. Heretofore, dark blue or green-colored infrared ray 
or ultrared ray absorbent glass containing a large amount 
of e.g. FeO, Fe2O3 and CeO2, has been known (Japanese 
Unexamined Patent Publication No. 310539/1992 or No. 
56466/1994). Further, glass having fine semiconductor 
crystals precipitated therein, so that it is capable of 
efficiently absorbing ultraviolet rays, is also known. 
However, the former glass contains a large amount of an 
iron component, whereby the luminous transmittance is 
low, and it is difficult to prepare brown-colored glass 
which is presently used for vehicles. Whereas, the glass 
with the fine semiconductor crystals can be formed stably 
only with borosilicate glass, and this method can not be  
 
applied to a float process as the typical process for the 
production of plate glass. Further, brown-colored glass 
has had a problem that it is likely to be discolored by 
ultraviolet rays. It is an object of the present invention to obtain 
glass which is capable of absorbing ultraviolet rays and 
at the same time has a sufficient transmittance of 
visible lights and which will not be discolored by 
ultraviolet rays and has a color tone equivalent to 
conventional glass for buildings or vehicles. The present invention has been made to solve the 
above-mentioned problems and provides ultraviolet ray 
absorbent colored glass for buildings and vehicles, which 
consists essentially of from 65 to 75 wt% of SiO2, from 
0.1 to 5.0 wt% of Al2O3, from 10 to 18 wt% of Na2O, from 
0 to 5 wt% of K2O, from 5 to 15 wt% of CaO, from 1 to 6 
wt% of MgO, from 0.05 to 1.0 wt% of SO3, from 0.08 to 
0.20 wt% of vanadium as calculated as V2O5, from 0.36 to 
0.65 wt% of MnO2, from 0 to 0.0020 wt% of CoO and from 
0.06 to 0.18 wt% of iron as calculated as Fe2O3, wherein 
from 0 to 10 wt% of the total iron content is FeO. Now, the present invention will be described in 
detail with reference to the preferred embodiments. Firstly, the reasons for defining the above 
components will be explained. If SiO2 is less than 65 wt%, the weather resistance 
tends to be poor, and if it exceeds 75 wt%, the glass  
 
tends to undergo devitrification. If the proportion of 
Al2O3 is less than 0.1 wt%, the water resistance tends to 
be low, and if it exceeds 5%, the
