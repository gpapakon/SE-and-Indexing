<ABSTRACT>
A frequency divider comprises a transmission gate (T1) 
having input and output terminals and a gate
 terminal to 
which a single-phase clock signal (CLK) is applied to turn 

on or off the transmission gate (T1); an element (S1) having 
an input terminal connected to the output terminal of the 

transmission gate (T1), and performing inversion, delay, and 
amplification of a signal input to the input terminal and 

outputting the signal to the input terminal of the 
transmission gate (T1); and an output terminal (OUT) 

connected to the output terminal of the element (S1) having 
functions of inversion, delay, and amplification and to the 

input terminal of the transmission gate (T1), and outputting 
a signal having a frequency equal to 1/n (n = integer) of 

the frequency of the clock signal. Since the frequency 
divider comprises one transmission gate (T1) and one element 

(S1) having functions of inversion, delay, and 
amplification, the delay time of the critical path required 

for inverting the produced frequency-divided signal is 
reduced, so that accurate frequency division is performed 

with high-speed clock. Further, accurate frequency division 
is achieved with a single-phase clock signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frequency divider 
that produces an output signal whose frequency is an exact 
integral submultiple of the frequency of an input clock 
signal. A frequency divider is used to gradually reduce the 
frequency of an input signal. Figure 9 is a circuit diagram illustrating a prior art 
frequency divider. The frequency divider of figure 9 comprises 
transmission gates T4 and T5 that are turned on or off when 
a positive phase clock signal and a negative phase clock 
signal are input to the gate terminals, respectively, an 
element S3 having function of amplification (hereinafter 
referred to as amplification element), and an element S4 
having functions of inversion and amplification (hereinafter 
referred to as inversion and amplification element). The amplification element S3 is interposed between an 
output terminal of the transmission gate T4 and an input 
terminal of the transmission gate T5. The inversion and 
amplification element S4 is interposed between an output 
terminal of the transmission gate T5 and an input terminal 
of the transmission gate T4.  In this prior art frequency divider, an input terminal 
of a positive phase clock CLK is connected to the gate 
terminal of the transmission gate T4, and an input terminal 
of a negative phase clock CLK is connected to the gate 
terminal of the transmission gate T5. The amplification 
element S3 is interposed between the output terminal of the 
transmission gate T4 and the input terminal of the 
transmission gate T5. The inversion and amplification 
element S4 is interposed between the output terminal of the 
transmission gate T5 and the input terminal of the 
transmission gate T4. An output terminal OUT of the circuit 
from which a signal obtained by frequency-dividing the 
positive or negative phase clock signal is output is 
connected to the output terminal of the element S4. That 
is, this frequency divider comprises two transmission gates 
T4 and T5, two input terminals of clock signals having 
opposite phases, an element S3 having function of 
amplification, and an element S4 having functions of 
inversion and amplification. Figure 10 illustrates an example of the frequency 
divider shown in figure 9 in which a noninverting logic 
circuit is employed as the amplification element S3 and an 
inverting logic circuit is employed as the inversion and 
amplification element S4. In figure 10, a noninverting 
logic circuit G5 corresponds to the amplification element S3  
 
of figure 9, and an inverting logic circuit G6
