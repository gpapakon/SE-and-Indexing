<ABSTRACT>
A single wavelength semiconductor laser 
comprises a laser cavity portion and a mode 

selector portion. The laser cavity portion 
includes a waveguide and perturbation means 

for imparting a periodical perturbation to 
the waveguide. The laser cavity portion 

functions as a mode selecting reflective mirror 
for coupling two modes, which have different absolute 

values of propagation constants, to each other, 
accompanied with a mode conversion. The two 

coupled modes respectively travel forward and 
rearward along the waveguide to constitute two 

degenerate laser resonance modes. The mode selector 
portion selectively outputs a predetermined laser 

resonance mode out of the two degenerate laser 

resonance modes, and the mode selector portion 
is structured so that light returing to the 

semiconductor laser from outside can be coupled 
only to the other of the two degenerate laser 

resonance modes. Thus, a dynamic single wavelength 
semiconductor laser is obtained, which is insensitive 

to returning light, even without use of any isolator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a single-wavelength 
semiconductor laser that is applicable to optical 
communications, optical exchanges, optical recordings, 
optical operations, optical measurements and the like. Conventionally, a Fabry-Perot type of semiconductor 
laser, which uses its cleaved facets as a cavity, has 
been known. This type of laser has a cavity whose 
length is several hundred to several thousand times 
as large as the oscillation wavelength, and has multiple 
resonance or longitudinal modes in the vicinity of 
the laser's gain peak. Therefore, the laser is likely to 
oscillate in a multimode fashion, and such multimode 
oscillation is particularly prominent during 
high-speed modulation driving. Multimode oscillation 
becomes a serious problem when that type of laser is 
used in fiber optical communications, because of the 
wavelength dispersion of the optical fiber. Hence, 
a dynamic single-mode semiconductor laser, which 
performs single wavelength operation even during 
high-speed modulation driving, has been earnestly studied 
and developed.  
 As a dynamic single-mode semiconductor laser, 
there have been proposed distributed feedback 
(DFB) and distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) 
lasers which introduce a distributed 
reflector of a grating into the cavity of the laser 
and utilize its wavelength selectivity in order to 
selectively reduce the resonator loss of only one 
resonance mode. However, when a part of the output 
light beam is reflected and returns to the laser cavity 
of that dynamic single-mode laser, the laser 
characteristic will greatly fluctuate even if the amount 
of the returning light is small. The fluctuation due to 
the returning light appears as fluctuations of light 
output power, oscillation mode and oscillation spectral 
width, with respect to static characteristics. As 
dynamic characteristics, for example, the intensity noise 
due to mode-hopping between axial or longitudinal 
modes of an external resonator increases and the response 
characteristic during the modulation driving due to the 
quantum noise varies, because of the returning light. The operation of the semiconductor laser under the 
influence of the returning light can be described by using 
a coupled cavity model. In this model, it is assumed 
that the multi-reflection at the external resonator is 
disregarded, and light emitted through the end facet 
of the laser is reflected by the external reflection 
plane to be returned to the laser and optically couples  
 
to the laser cavity at the
