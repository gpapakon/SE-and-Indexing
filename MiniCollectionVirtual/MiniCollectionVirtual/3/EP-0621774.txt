<ABSTRACT>
Solid particle aerosol formulations of polypeptide drugs are made by lyophilizing solutions of the drugs which contain milling stabilizers that inhibit degradation of the drug during subsequent milling. The lyophilized drug is milled in fluid energy mills that have been fitted with abrasion-resistant materials and which use pure nitrogen that has been filtered to eliminate particles of greater than 0.1  mu m to transport the drug. The use of (a) milling stabilizers in the solution and (b) abrasion-resistant fluid energy mills that use pure filtered nitrogen in the milling step reduce insoluble contaminants and inactive fractions in the milled product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the field of 
pharmaceutical formulation. More particularly, it 
concerns improvements in a process for micronizing 
polypeptide drugs into powders that are suitable for 
formulation as solid particle aerosols. Inhalation therapy involves the administration 
of a drug in an aerosol form to the respiratory tract. 
Two types of aerosols are employed: liquid particles and 
solid particles. The liquid aerosols are generated by 
nebulizing solutions of the drug. Solid particle 
aerosols are either in the form of a powder suspended in 
a propellant which is administered from a metered dose 
inhaler or simply as a powder that is administered from a 
dry powder inhaler. In the case of polypeptide drugs, 
solid particle aerosols are typically made by 
lyophilizing the drug from solution and then milling or 
grinding the lyophilized drug to the desired particle 
size distribution for pulmonary administration. Prior workers have recognized certain stability 
problems in making such drugs. First, prior workers have 
recognized that removal of residual water during the 
lyophilization in the presence of protective agents 
provides a more stable lyophilized product. A variety of  
 
excipients have bean proposed as such cryoprotactants 
(Pikal, M.J., Biopharm. (1990) 3(8):18-27 and Franks, F., 
Cryoletters (1990) 11:93-110. Prior workers have also recognized and 
addressed problems associated with the "stability" of 
drug powders that are used in solid particle aerosols. 
These "stability" problems involve the particles being 
adsorbed or absorbed by materials in which they come into 
contact during their handling or the particles forming 
agglomerates. For instance, PCT Application Publication 
No. WO90/09781 suggests using "extender" molecules to 
avoid particle adsorption, absorption, or agglomeration 
while metering the particles into unit dose containers. 
Among the suggested extenders are amino acids 
(particularly DL-methionine), mono-, di-, and 
polysaccharides, and polypeptides. European Patent Application Publication No. 
0384752 describes a process for reducing the particle 
size of protein material using a fluid energy mill. 
There is no mention of modification of the mill or of 
adding milling stabilizers to avoid degradation of the 
protein material. International Patent Application No. WO-A-9011091 describes a 
process for preparing a protein drug in the presence of a stabilizer, such as human 
serum albumin, thereby preventing denaturation of the proteins, agglomeration and
