<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electrodeposition coating 
compositions, and in particular to such compositions including an 
acid salt of zinc. Electrodeposition coating, or electrocoating, is 
widely used in the art for the application of polymer coatings 
to metal substrates. Electrodeposition baths usually comprise 
a principal film-forming resin, such as an acrylic or epoxy 
resin, with ionic groups that can be salted so that the resin 
can be dispersed or dissolved in an aqueous bath. Pigments 
(dispersed in resin pastes), dyes, flow control agents, and 
other additives are often included in the electrocoat bath. For automotive or industrial applications where hard 
electrocoat films are desired, the bath also includes a blocked 
crosslinking agent that unblocks under appropriate conditions 
(e.g., with the application of heat) to react with functional 
groups on the principal resin and thus cure the coating. One of the advantages of electrodeposition coating 
compositions and processes is that the coating composition can be 
applied to a variety of metallic substrates regardless of shape or 
configuration. This is especially advantageous when the coating is 
applied as an anticorrosive coating onto a substrate having a 
number of irregular surfaces, such as a motor vehicle body. In 
order to maximize an electrodeposition coating's anticorrosion 
effectiveness, it is important that the coating form a contiguous 
layer over all portions of the metallic substrate. A criterion for measuring the effectiveness of an 
electrodeposition coating for covering all portions of the 
substrate is throw power. Throw power measures the effectiveness 
of an electrodeposition coating at covering recessed or interior 
areas of a metal substrate. Good throw power is important in order 
to maximize anticorrosion effectiveness of an electrodeposition 
coating. Electrodeposition coatings must often satisfy a number of 
other criteria as well. A high degree of smoothness is often 
desirable. For example, when the electrodeposition coating serves 
as a primer for a high-gloss topcoat, the primer layer must be very  
 
smooth in order for the topcoat to have a satisfactory appearance. 
It is also advantageous to exhibit stability over a range of pH. It is therefore desirable to provide an electrodeposition 
coating composition that provides good throw power without 
compromising overall corrosion protection and smoothness. According to the present invention, there is provided an 
electrodeposition coating composition
