<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a polymer containing 
functional groups by reacting a polymer (A) having 

alkenyl groups with less than 1/N mole ratio with 
respect to the mole number of the alkenyl group of 

a silicon polyhydride compound (B) having 2 to 6 
hydrogen-silicon bonds in one molecule, so as to 

increase the molecular weight and leaving unreacted 
alkenyl groups remain in molecules, or if desired, by 

adding the silane compound (C) in the reaction system 
so as to react the silane compound with the remaining 

alkenyl group in one-point process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
preparing a polymer containing functional groups by
reacting a polymer containing alkenyl groups with a
silicon polyhydride compound.Conventionally, the molecular weight of a polymer
containing functional groups obtained by a transformation
of functional group is determined by the molecular
weight of the polymer used as its raw material. Since
the molecular weight between chemical crosslinks is
equal to the molecular weight of the starting polymer.
Therefore, in the case where a polymer containing
functional groups is made to serve as a curable
composition utilizing its functional group, the
properties of the product polymer obtained are
inevitably restricted according to the molecular weight
of starting material.For example, for preparation of a polymer
containing a plurality of alkenyl groups in one molecule
from a polyisobutylene serving as a starting polymer,
methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,316,973,
JP-A-63-105005 and JP-A-4-103606
can be considered. However, in
any of these methods, a polyisobutylene is prepared by
the cationic polymerizing method for isobutylene
monomers in a solvent (inifer method). However, when
the molecular weight of the polymer obtained by the 
polymerization is excessively high, polymer is
precipitated out from the polymerization system, thus
resulting in an ununiform reaction. Therefore, in
practice, the molecular weight can only be achieved up
to 5,000 to 10,000 at most.In the meantime, for preparation of a polymer
containing a plurality of silyl groups in one molecule,
methods disclosed in
JP-A-63-006003 and 1-197509 can be
considered. However, the starting polymer is a polymer
containing alkenyl groups in each of the these
publications, and therefore it is difficult to prepare
an oligomer having a molecular weight of higher than
10,000 for the same reason as indicated above. Even if
an oligomer having a molecular weight of 10,000 or more
is prepared, the molecular-weight distribution will
be broad due to the ununiformity of the reaction,
which is caused by the precipitation of the polymer,
which is caused by the separating of oligomer, and the
introduction of functional groups such as alkenyl groups
cannot be completely performed.Further, if the molecular weight exceeds 10,000,
the viscosity of the obtained oligomer increases
remarkably. As a result, the pumping out and transfer
of a product, which follows the completion of the
purification and concentration step after
polymerization, cannot be performed or easily
