<ABSTRACT>
A coiled tubing conveyed sampling apparatus (40) 
includes an actuator housing (44,46) having a housing 

interior (80) and having a proximal housing end (82) 
including a connector (84) for connecting the housing to a 

coiled tubing string (30) so that a tubing bore (100) of the 
coiled tubing string is communicated with the housing 

interior. A one-way check valve (114) is disposed in the 
housing interior (80) and allows well fluid from the well 

bore to fill the tubing bore (100) of the coiled tubing 
string as the sampling apparatus (40) is run into the well. 

The check valve (114) isolates the tubing bore (100) of the 
coiled tubing string (30) from the well when pressure in the 

tubing bore (100) exceeds pressure in the well. A sampling 
tool is attached to a lower end of the actuator housing 

(46). A pressure responsive actuator (92,94,120,114) is 
disposed in the housing interior (80) and actuates the 

sampling tool in response to pressure in the tubing bore 
(100) of the coiled tubing string (30) exceeding pressure in 

the well by a first predetermined value so that a well fluid 
sample is drawn into the sampling tool and trapped in the 

sampling tool. The apparatus is especially useful in taking 
samples from horizontal portions of highly deviated wells.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coiled tubing 
conveyed sampling apparatus, and to a method of obtaining a 
sample of well fluid. Reference is made to our European divisional 
patent application no. 96 202 033.5. It is becoming a common practice to drill highly 
deviated wells often referred to as horizontal wells. Such 
a highly deviated or horizontal well typically includes a 
substantially vertical portion followed by a radiused 
portion which leads to a substantially horizontal portion of 
the well bore which runs for substantial distances 
horizontally through a subsurface formation from which oil 
or gas is to be produced. Many testing tools which are designed for use on 
wireline cannot function satisfactorily in horizontal wells 
because of the fact that the wireline tools which depend on 
gravity for their motive force cannot extend outward into a 
horizontal portion of the well. The present invention provides a sampler 
constructed to be run on coiled tubing. The sampler is 
constructed to be actuated in response to an increase in 
pressure within the coiled tubing and thus provides positive 
surface control of actuation of the sampler. The sampler is 
especially useful in horizontal wells since, unlike wireline 
conveyed samplers, the coiled tubing can be used to move the 
sampler into the horizontal portion of the well. According to the present invention, there is 
provided a coiled tubing conveyed sampling apparatus which  
 
comprises an actuator housing having a housing interior 
and having a proximal housing end including connector means 
for connecting said housing to a coiled tubing string so 
that a tubing bore of said coiled tubing string communicates 
with said housing interior; check valve means, disposed in 
said housing interior for allowing well fluid from a well 
bore to fill said tubing bore of said coiled tubing string 
as said sampling apparatus is run into said well bore on 
said coiled tubing string, and for isolating said tubing 
bore from said well bore when pressure in said tubing bore 
exceeds pressure in said well bore; a sampling tool 
attached to said actuator housing; and pressure responsive 
actuator means disposed in said housing interior for 
actuating said sampling tool in response to pressure in said 
tubing bore exceeding pressure in said well bore by a first 
value so that a well fluid sample is trapped in said 
sampling tool. Preferably, a relief and drain valve is also 
provided for relieving pressure from the tubing bore to the 
well bore when pressure

A coiled tubing conveyed sampling apparatus (40) 
which comprises an actuator housing (44,46) having a housing 

interior (80) and having a proximal housing end (82) 
including connector means (84) for connecting said housing 

to a coiled tubing string (30) so that a tubing bore (100) 
of said coiled tubing string communicates with said housing 

interior (80); check valve means (114), disposed in said 
housing interior (80) for allowing well fluid from a well 

bore to fill said tubing bore of said coiled tubing string 
as said sampling apparatus is run into said well bore on 

said coiled tubing string (30), and for isolating said 
tubing bore (100) from said well bore when pressure in said 

tubing bore exceeds pressure in said well bore; a sampling 
tool attached to said actuator housing (44,46); and 

pressure responsive actuator means (92,94,120,114) disposed 
in said housing interior for actuating said sampling tool in 

response to pressure in said tubing bore (100) exceeding 
pressure in said well bore by a first value so that a well 

fluid sample is trapped in said sampling tool. 
Apparatus according to claim 1, further comprising 
relief and drain valve means (92,94,122,86) for relieving 

pressure from said tubing bore (100) to said well bore when 
pressure in said tubing bore (100) exceeds pressure in said 

well bore by a second value greater than said first value, 
and for allowing fluid to drain from said tubing bore (100) 

when said coiled tubing string (30) and said sampling 
apparatus (40) are retrieved from said well bore. 
Apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said 
relief and drain valve means (92,94,122,86) includes a 

relief port (86) defined in said actuator housing (44,46) 
and a sliding sleeve valve (92) received within said housing 

interior (80) and slidable from a first position wherein  
 

said relief port (86) is closed to a second position wherein 
said relief port (86) is open; and said check valve means
