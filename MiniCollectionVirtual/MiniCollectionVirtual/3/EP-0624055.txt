<ABSTRACT>
A power supply structure for a multichip package is 
provided to improve the transmission performance of signals. 

Cases (120) are fitted onto one face of a ceramic substrate 
(103). On the other face are aligned substrates (121). 

On each of the substrates (121) are erected I/O pins (105). 
The I/O pins (105) are connected to signal pins (113) of 

LSIs (101) via the ceramic substrate's internal layer (104). 
On side faces of the substrates (121) are pvovided power 

supply pads (122). To the power supply pads (122) are 
connected the power supply pins (112) of the LSIs (101) 

via the ceramic substrate's internal layer (104). When 
power is to be supplied, electroconductive bars (123) are 

inserted between the substrates (121). The electroconductive 
bars (123) supply power to the LSIs (101) via 

the power supply pads (121). A cable (110) is connected 
to one of the I/O pins (105).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power supply 
structure for a multichip package, and more particularly 
to a power supply structure for a multichip package in 
which high-speed integrated circuits are to be mounted. Multiple packaging is one of the techniques for 
increasing the signal transmission speed between integrated 
circuits. Multichip packaging means the mounting of a 
plurality of integrated circuits on a single substrate. 
Within a multichip package, a plurality of integrated 
circuits are packaged in high density. The shorter 
distances between the integrated circuits result in 
the faster signal transmission between the circuits. However, a further increase in processing speed 
of integrated circuits requires further improvement in 
signal transmission speed. A technique for satisfying 
this requirement, disclosed in the U.S. Patent No. 
4,819,131, is intended for further improvement in the 
signal transmission speed between integrated circuits. Referring to FIG. 1 of the above-mentioned patent 
gazette, a plurality of integrated circuit chips 2 are 
packaged over a multilayer substrate 1. The integrated 
circuit chips 2 and the multilayer substrate 1 constitute 
a multichip package. Referring to FIG. 3, the multilayer  
 
substrate 1 is mounted on a mother board 20. The multi-layer 
substrate 1 and the mother board 20 are connected 
to each other by input/output pins and power supply pins. 
Referring to FIG. 2, the input/output pins and the power 
supply pins constitute coaxial pins 3. Inner conductors 8 
of the coaxial pins 3 are the input/output pins, which 
convey signals. Outer conductors 9 surpress waveform 
distortion or crosstalk of these signals. The elimination 
of waveform distortion or crosstalk result in the reduction 
of the distances between the input/output pins, which in 
turn serves to shorten the distances between the integrated 
circuit chips 2. Shorter distances between the integrated 
circuit chips 2 result in a higher speed of signal 
transmission. The above-described technique achieve higher signal 
transmission speed within a multichip package. However, 
no effective technique has as yet been developed to 
increase the speed of signals transmission between the 
inside and the outside of a multichip package. Referring again to FIGS. 1 and 3 of the U.S. Patent 
No. 4,819,131, on the rear face of the mother board 20 
is provided a connector, not shown, to which an external 
unit is connected. Signals between the integrated circuit 
chips 2 and the external unit pass
