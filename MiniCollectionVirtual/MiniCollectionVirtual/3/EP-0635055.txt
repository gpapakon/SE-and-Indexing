<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
bacterial antigens. More particularly, the present
invention pertains to proteins derived from Haemophilus.
somnus and the use of the same in vaccine compositions.Haemophilus somnus is a Gram negative bacterium
which is related to several Actinobacillus species and
appears to be identical to Histophilus ovis and
Haemophilus agni (Philbey et al., Aust. Vet. J. (1991)
88:387-390. H. somnus causes a number of disease
syndromes in animals. The bacterium is commonly
associated with thromboembolic meningoencephalitis
(ITEME), septicemia, arthritis, and pneumonia (Corbeil,
L.B., Can. J. Vet. Res. (1990) 54:S57-S62; Harris, F.W.,
and Janzen, E.D., Can. Vet. J. (1990) 30:816-822;
Humphrey, J.D., and Stephens, L.R., Vet. Bull. (1983)
53:987-1004). These diseases can cause significant
economic losses to the farm industry. Currently
available vaccines are either based on killed whole cells
or on outer membrane protein (OMP) preparations. (See,
e.g. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,981,685 and 4,877,613). However,
whole cell bacterins and surface protein extracts often
contain immunosuppressive components which can render
animals more susceptible to infection. Furthermore, an
OMP enriched vaccine has only been shown to offer
significant protection against H. somnus induced disease
in an experimental challenge model (Harland, R.J., etal., Res. Work. Anim. Dis. 71st (1990) 29:6). Subunit
vaccines, i.e. vaccines including select proteins
separated from the whole bacterium, afford a method for
overcoming the problems inherent in the use of the above-described
vaccines.Iron is an essential nutrient for bacterial
growth and the ability to acquire iron from a host's
iron-limiting environment is necessary to establish and
maintain an infection. A correlation between virulence
and the ability to scavenge iron from the host has been
shown (Archibald, F.S., and DeVoe, I.W., FEMS Microbiol.
Lett. (1979) 6:159-162; Archibald, F.S., and DeVoe, I.W.,
Infect. Immun. (1980) 27:322-334; Herrington, D.A., and
Sparling, F.P., Infect. Immun. (1985) 48:248-251;
Weinberg, E.D., Microbiol. Rev. (1978) 42:45-66).Bacteria can scavenge iron from a number of
sources. Iron-containing compounds, such as free heme,
haemoglobin, myoglobin, transferrin, lactoferrin,
catalase, cytochromes, haem-haemopexin, haem-albumin,
haemoglobin-haptoglobulin, and the like, can provide
iron, depending on the bacterium in question. A limited
number of Gram-negative bacteria, including Haemophilus
species, can utilize haemin as a source
