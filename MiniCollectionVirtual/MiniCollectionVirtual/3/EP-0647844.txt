<ABSTRACT>
An automated interactive cytology system provides expedited 
handling of samples, minimizing false negatives, while not 

substantially increasing the number false positives. A computerized 
system identifies and displays the cells which are of greatest interest 

to the cytologist. The system then processes this information on all 
cells identified to classify the slide as normal, abnormal, or 

questionable based on a statistical analysis of cells meeting given 
criteria. Before displaying the results of the statistical analysis, a 

cytologist reviews the cells which the computer has determined to be 
most significa
nt. It is only then after the cytologist has determined 
whether the cells are positive, negative, or questionable, that the 

determination is inputted into the automated system. The automated 
system then compares the cytologist's analysis with its own statistical 

analysis. Based on the two opinions, the cytologist determines how to 
advise a doctor regarding the sample.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of automated cytology, and in
particular to an interactive method of automated cytology in which a
cytotechnologist or cytopathologist interacts with an automated
cytology screening system to markedly increase accuracy.Presently, several computerized cytology systems are being
introduced into the market place. Cytyc Corporation has been
developing its CDS-1000tm cytology workstation (Automated Cervical
Cancer Screening, An International Perspective, Oct. 17-19, 1991,
Hyatt Regency Tech Center, Denver Colorado) in which a computer
system identifies cells having the highest potential for being
abnormal, representative normal cells for the comparison, and
clusters of cells which may be of interest to the system operator.
Such a system provides the cytotechnologist or cytopathologist
("cytologist") with a narrowed field of cells for review, but generates
no machine interpretation as to specimen normality or abnormality.NeoPath, Inc. has been developing its AutoPaptm 300 system
(Automated Cervical Cancer Screening, An International Perspective,
Oct. 17-19, 1991, Hyatt Regency Tech Center, Denver Colorado) for
automatic screening of conventional Papanicolaou slide smears. This
automatic analysis system scans multiple smears and classifies each
smear either as normal or requiring review. Only samples classified
as needing further review are to be reviewed by a cytologist and no
cell images are selected for display.On the other hand, automated computer systems also have their
drawback. Although a computer system adds uniformity based on its
statistical analysis approach, there is no practical way for the
computer to interpret abnormality based on the presence of only a
few abnormal cells. Thus, many systems do not rely on the computer
to interpret the normality or abnormality of the cells. Neuromedical 
Systems, Inc. has been developing its PapnetÂ® system
(Automated Cervical Cancer Screening, An International
Perspective, Oct. 17-19, 1991, Hyatt Regency Tech Center,
Denver Colorado) designed with the philosophy that the
actual evaluation of the cells and interpretation of the
case are left to the cytologist reviewing the case, since
the task is both highly complex and subjective. The
cytologist reviews each case on a high-resolution, full-color
monitor having images displayed in a grid-like
manner. Here again there is no computer interpretation of
the specific cases.Moreover, automated cytological specimen classification
systems and methods have been described in U.S. Patent

<CLAIMS>
An interactive method of evaluating cells in a
biological sample using a computer-assisted system and an

operator, which comprises:

(a) the system scanning the biological sample using an
automated scanning device and generating scan data

corresponding to the biological sample;
(b) the system classifying cells in the scan data by

identifying cells exhibiting a first predetermined set of
characteristics;
(c) the system generating a gallery of cells, the
gallery comprising a plurality of cell images for display

to the operator, the plurality of cell images including
images of cells which exhibit the first predetermined set

of characteristics;
(d) the system preparing a diagnosis of the biological
sample, wherein the diagnosis is based on statistical

analysis of the occurrence of cells exhibiting the first
predetermined set of characteristics;
(e) the operator viewing the gallery of cells and
independently preparing a diagnosis of the biological

sample, wherein the operator diagnosis is prepared without
the operator knowing the diagnosis of the system;
(f) the operator inputting the independently prepared
diagnosis into the system;
(g) then the system displaying the system diagnosis to
the operator; and
(h) comparing the independently prepared operator
diagnosis with the system diagnosis to determine whether

further review of the cells is required.
The interactive method of claim 1, wherein the
scanning comprises scanning a microscope slide.
The interactive method of claim 2, wherein the
microscope slide contains cytological material. 
The interactive method of claim 3, wherein the
first predetermined set of characteristics correspond to

physically identifiable parameters.
The interactive method of claim 4, wherein the
physically identifiable set of parameters are selected from

the group consisting of cell size, nuclear size, color and
shape.
The interactive method of claim 1, wherein the
generating of scan data comprises forming a digital image

of the scanned sample.
The interactive method of claim 1, wherein the
generating of the gallery further comprises displaying the

gallery on a television screen.
The interactive method of claim 7, wherein the
television screen is a high definition television screen.
The interactive method of claim 7, wherein the
television screen displays about 60 cells at one time.
The interactive method of claim 1, wherein the
statistical analysis of the occurrence of cells exhibiting

the first predetermined set of characteristics comprises
assigninq a value to each cell based on the number and

nature of the characteristics identified from the first
predetermined set of characteristics which are present in

each cell.
The interactive method of claim 10, wherein the
values assigned to the cells are totalled and compared to

a predetermined value, thereby preparing a system diagnosis
of the biological sample. 
The interactive method of claim 1, further
comprising manually reviewing the cells if either the

independently prepared operator diagnosis or the system
diagnosis indicates that at least one cell is abnormal.
The interactive method of claim 1 further
comprising reporting a normal diagnosis if the

independently prepared operator diagnosis and the system
diagnosis agree that the cells are normal.
