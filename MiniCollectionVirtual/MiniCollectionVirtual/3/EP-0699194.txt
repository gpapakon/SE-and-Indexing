<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to novel compounds having pharmacological activity, to a process for their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals.European Journal of Pharmacology 146 (1988), 187-188, and Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. (1989) 340:403-410, describe a non classical 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor, now designated the 5-HT4 receptor, and that ICS 205-930, which is also a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, acts as an antagonist at this receptor.WO 91/16045 (SmithKline and French Laboratories Limited) describes the use of cardiac 5-HT4 receptor antagonists in the treatment of atrial arrhythmias and stroke.EP-A-501322 (Glaxo Group Limited), WO 93/02677, WO 93/03725, WO 93/05038, WO 93/05040, WO 93/18036, PCT/EP93/03054, PCT/GB93/01895, PCT/GB93/02028, PCT/EP93/02808, PCT/EP93/02775, PCT/EP93/02809, PCT/GB93/02130, PCT/EP93/003054, PCT/GB94/000172 (SmithKline Beecham plc) describe compounds having 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity.EP 0173585A1 and US 4665076 (applicant/assignee Rhone-Poulenc Sante) disclose compounds of the general formula (4-piperidyl)-CH2-CH2-CO-Ar, i.e. 1-aryl-3-(4-piperidyl)-1-propanone; wherein the aryl group = 1- or 2-naphthyl, or optionally substituted 1-isoquinolyl or 4-quinazolinyl; for use in treating and/or preventing disturbances of cardiac rhythm, in particular ventricular arrhythmias.DE-A-2618152 and US 4064255 (applicant/assignee: Mar-Pha) discloses a method of treating depression using a compound of formula (4-piperidyl)-(CH2)n-CO-Ar wherein Ar = optionally substituted 3-indolyl. In US 4064255, the compounds of the invention are disclosed as being effective in blocking serotonin uptake.It has now been discovered that certain compounds also have 5-HT4 receptor antagonist properties, i.e. have 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity.Accordingly, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof:
