<ABSTRACT>
A proofing element containing: (a) a photoconductive layer on an electrically 
conductive substrate; and (b) overlaying the photoconductive layer, a removable 

dielectric layer containing thermoplastic polymeric resinous particles which have 
steric stabilizer groups adhered to the surfaces of said polymeric particles, said steric 

stabilizer groups being in coordinated association with a charge directing moiety and 
said charge directing moiety having a charge dissipating agent in association 

therewith. 
A process for applying a removable dielectric layer to a photoconductive 
substrate comprising the steps of: (a) applying an organosol to a photoconductive 

substrate, the organosol comprising: a carrier liquid having a dispersion therein of 
thermoplastic polymeric resinous particles which have steric stabilizer groups adhered 

to the surfaces of said polymeric particles, said steric stabilizer groups being in 
coordinated association with a charge directing moiety and said charge directing 

moiety having a charge dissipating agent in association therewith; and (b) removing 
the carrier liquid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrophotographic color proofing element and more
particularly, it relates to a photoconductive layer coated with a releasable dielectric
layer. This invention also relates to a process for making the inventive
electrophotographic color proofing elementMulticolor toner images produced by successive toner transfer from a
photoconductor to a single receptor are well known in the art, both for powder
toners with constituents in tended to improve resolution on transfer and for use with
magnetic brush development (U.S. Pat. No. 3,833,293). U.S. Pat. No. 3,612,677
discloses a machine designed to provide good registration when using successive
color image transfer and U.S. Pat. No. 3,804,619 discloses special powder toners to
overcome difficulties toners have in three color successive transfer.U.S. Pat. No. 3,847,642 discloses a method and apparatus for transferring
and fixing images formed by electrostatographic imaging techniques. A thin film of
viscous material is applied to an imaging member prior to or after forming an
electrostatic latent image thereon. The latent image is developed with electroscopic
marking material and the resulting developed image is transferred by contact to a
recording medium. A portion of the viscous material is also transferred to the
recording medium with the image and is subsequently solidified, thereby fixing the
image to the recording medium.The production of multi-colored images by overlaying toned images on a
photoconductor surface is also known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,337,340
discloses liquid developers designed to minimize the "bleeding away of charge on
the photoconductor surface" which occurs when recharging of an already toned
surface is attempted. U.S. Pat. No. 4,155,862 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,157,219 disclose
liquid 
toner formulations and apparatus for producing multicolor composite toned images
on a photoconductor surface. U.S. Pat. No. 4,275,136 emphasizes the difficulties in
ensuring that overlaid toner layers on a photoconductor adhere to one another. The
addition of zinc or aluminum hydroxides coated on the colorant particles is used to
solve the problem.Many methods are used to aid the efficient transfer of toner from a
photoconductor surface after toner development to a receptor sheet. U.S. Pat. No.
3,157,546 discloses overcoating a developed toner image while it is still on the
photoconductor. A liquid layer having a concentration of about 5 % of a film-forming
material in a solvent is used at between 10 and 50 microns wet
