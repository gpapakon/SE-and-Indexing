<ABSTRACT>
A method of waste disposal is described which 
comprises initiating a zone of oxidation by combining a 

source of elemental phosphorus and an oxygen-containing gas, 
within a protective layer of an inert, non-flammable fluid 

(such as water). The non-flammable fluid protects the 
elemental phosphorus from otherwise contacting atmospheric 

oxygen so that the elemental phosphorus is oxidized within 
the protective layer by the oxygen-containing gas thereby 

providing a zone of high temperature oxidation to incinerate 
the waste (e.g., a chemical waste).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to method of waste 
disposal involving oxidation of elemental phosphorus. A procedure is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,868,094 
wherein an elemental phosphorus material is contacted with 
an oxygen-containing gas while the elemental phosphorus is 
protected from contact with atmospheric oxygen by a 
protective layer of an inert, non-flammable fluid, such as 
water. The bringing together of the oxygen-containing gas 
and elemental phosphorus, while the phosphorus is within the 
protective blanketing layer of fluid, such as water, causes 
highly exothermic oxidation of the phosphorus in a safe and 
efficient manner oxidation of the protective fluid layer. When 
water is the selected protective layer, the oxidation of the 
phosphorus generates P₂O₅ values and yields a phosphoric 
acid solution which can be recovered for ultimate commercial 
usage. The oxidation between the elemental phosphorus and 
oxygen, as mentioned above, is highly exothermic since 
phosphorus normally burns in air at extremely high 
temperatures in the neighborhood of 2300°C-2700°C depending, 
for example, upon the presence of excess air. If oxygen-­
enriched air or substantially pure oxygen is used, the 
temperature of oxidation can be even higher (e.g., 5000-­
5000°C). The present invention is a method of waste disposal 
which comprises using the aforementioned type of technology 
to incinerate an undesired waste. Although the waste, in a 
preferred embodiment, is a chemical waste, the present 
invention is broadly applicable to disposal, via 
incineration, of any waste or refuse. The present method  
 
comprises: (1) at least intially combining a source of 
elemental phosphorus and an oxygen-containing gas, within a 
protective layer of an inert, non-flammable fluid (such as 
water) which protects the elemental phosphorus from 
otherwise contacting atmospheric oxygen, to initiate a zone 
of extremely high temperature from the resulting oxidation; 
and (2) bringing a waste into contact with that oxidation 
zone. When the waste is brought into contact with the zone 
of oxidation intially generated by the elemental phosphorus 
and oxygen within the protective fluid blanket, the waste is 
incinerated or decomposed. The present invention, in 
another aspect, is directed to waste incineration by use of 
a sustained zone of oxidation within a layer of a fluid by 
the combination of a fuel and an oxygen-containing gas which 
produces and sustains the zone of oxidation in the fluid. The aforementioned U.S. Patent No.

<CLAIMS>
1. A method of waste disposal which comprises 
initiating a zone of oxidation by mixing a source of 

elemental phosphorus and an oxygen-containing gas, within 
a protective layer of an inert non-flammable fluid which 

protects the elemental phosphorus from contact with the 
atmosphere, and bringing a waste into contact with the 

zone of oxidation so that the waste is thereby 
incinerated within the layer of fluid. 
2. A method of waste disposal which comprises 
sustaining a zone of oxidation within a protective layer 

of an inert non-flammable fluid by mixing a fuel and an 
oxygen-containing gas to produce the zone of oxidation 

and bringing a waste into contact with the zone of 
oxidation to incinerate the waste within the layer of 

fluid. 
3. A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the fluid is water and the oxygen-­

containing gas is substantially pure oxygen. 
4. A method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2 
characterised in that the waste is a chemical waste. 
5. A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4 
characterised in that the fluid is water.
