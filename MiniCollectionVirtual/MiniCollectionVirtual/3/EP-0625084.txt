<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to abrasive articles,
and more particularly, to a coated abrasive article
having an embossed backing containing recesses that
carry abrasive composite members therein.Abrasive articles have long been known in the
art, and have been used to abrade, finish, and polish a
variety of surfaces. In its most basic form, a coated
abrasive article comprises abrasive grains adhered to a
backing. Paper and cloth have long been used as
backing materials for coated abrasive articles. The
abrasive grains may also be adhered to other types of
backings, including inflexible backings.Coarse-grade abrasive articles are used for
rough sanding or abrading of a workpiece. At the other
end of the spectrum, extremely fine abrasive grains,
sometimes called microabrasive grains, are incorporated
into coated abrasive articles and used to achieve a
close tolerance finish or polish. Coated abrasive
articles containing microabrasive grains are used, for
example, for magnetic head finishing; polishing or
burnishing floppy disks; creating high gloss finishes
on an acrylic surface; and providing a final finish to
stainless steel or brass.Whether using microabrasive grains, coarse-grade
abrasive grains, or other types of abrasive
grains, the abrading surface of a coated abrasive
article can become clogged or gummed by materials worn from
the workpiece. One way this problem has been addressed
is by applying the abrasive grains to the surface of a
backing in a dot pattern or matrix. See, for example, 
U.S. Patent Nos. 3,246,430 (Hurst); 794,495 (Gorton);
1,657,784 (Bergstrom); 4,317,660 (Kramis et al.). When
abrasive grains are disposed in a pattern, pathways
exist for abraded material to be removed.Coated abrasive articles having abrasive
grains arranged in a dot pattern have been made by
applying adhesive to a backing in a desired dot
pattern. The surface is then flooded with abrasive
grains that adhere to the dots of adhesive. This
method typically provides multiple abrasive grains at
each adhesive position. Alternatively, the adhesive
can be continuous and the abrasive grains can be
applied in a desired pattern.Other types of abrasive tools have been made
by setting abrasive granules, such as diamonds, into a
desired pattern by hand. It does not appear that hand
setting of large abrasive granules, such as diamonds,
has been employed in a commercially available flexible
coated abrasive article.Abrasive grains, even when tightly graded,
vary in size, and are typically of an irregular shape.

<CLAIMS>
An abrasive article comprising:

an embossed backing sheet having a front surface and
a back surface, said front surface having a plurality

of unconnected recesses formed therein, each of said
recesses having a side wall portion and a recessed

surface portion, the side wall portion extending
between the front surface and the recessed surface

portion of each recess;
a plurality of abrasive composite members positioned
in said recesses, such that one abrasive composite

member is positioned in each recess, said abrasive
composite members being expanded with an expanding

agent to extend above the front surface
of said embossed backing sheet, each of said abrasive

composite members surrounded by a region free of
abrasive composite members, said abrasive composite

members comprising abrasive grains dispersed in a
solidified binder.
The abrasive article of claim 1 further including a
size coat provided over said embossed backing sheet and

said abrasive composite members.
An abrasive article comprising:

an embossed backing sheet having a front surface, a
back surface, and a plurality of unconnected recesses

extending completely through said embossed backing
sheet, said recesses including a side wall portion 

extending from the front surface to the back surface
of said embossed backing sheet;
a plurality of abrasive composite members positioned
in said recesses, such that one abrasive composite

member is positioned in each recess, said abrasive
composite members being expanded with an expanding

agent to extend above both the front
surface and the back surface of said embossed backing

sheet, each of said abrasive composite members
surrounded by a region free of abrasive composite

members, said abrasive composite members comprising
abrasive grains dispersed in a solidified binder.
The abrasive article of claim 3, further including a

size coat provided over the front surface or back
surface or both surfaces of the embossed backing sheet

and over said abrasive composite members.
The abrasive article of any one of claims 1 to 4,
wherein said abrasive composite members are unconnected

and have an average area spacing such that there are 2
to 10,000 members/cm
2
.
The abrasive article of any one of claims 1 to 5,
wherein said abrasive composite members have an

elongated shape and have a linear spacing of 2 to 100
members/cm.
The abrasive article of any one of claims 1 to 6,
wherein said abrasive composite members contain from 5

to 95 percent by weight abrasive grains.
The abrasive article of any one of claims 1 to 7,
wherein the material of said embossed backing sheet is

selected from the group consisting of paper, polymeric 
film, fiber, and non-woven materials, coated

combinations thereof, and treated combinations thereof.
The abrasive article of any one of claims 1 to 8,
wherein said abrasive composite members are uniform in

height.
The abrasive article of any one of claims 1 to 9,
wherein the top surface of said abrasive composite

members has a pattern thereon.
The abrasive article of any one of claims 1 to 10,
wherein said abrasive composite members have a maximum

dimension of 10 to 5000 micrometers.
A method for manufacturing an abrasive article according
to claims 1 or 2,

comprising the steps of:

A. providing an embossed backing sheet having a front
surface and a back surface, said front surface having

unconnected recesses formed therein, each of said
recesses having side wall portions and a recessed

surface portion, said side wall portions extending
between said front surface and said recessed surface

portion of each recess;
B. providing each of said recesses with (1) an abrasive
slurry comprising a plurality of abrasive grains

dispersed in a binder precursor and (2) an expanding
agent;
C. activating said expanding agent to cause said
abrasive slurry to increase in volume sufficiently so

that said abrasive slurry expands above said front
surface of said embossed backing sheet;
D. solidifying said binder precursor whereby a plurality
of abrasive composite members extending above said

front surface of said embossed backing sheet are
formed in said recesses; and optionally applying a 

size coat over the front surface of said embossed
backing sheet and over said abrasive composite

members.
The method of claim 12 for manufacturing an abrasive
article according to claims 3 or 4, wherein the

recesses in the embossed backing sheet used in step A
extend completely through said sheet.
The method of claim 12 or 13, wherein said size coat is
