<ABSTRACT>
Device for gripping and handling objects (5) with a hole (8), such as compact discs. It comprises a carrier (2) to be placed above the object at the hole. Spring-loaded control means (10) extend through the carrier, which means can move gripping means (16) inwrds and outwards relative to the supporting face (3) of the carrier. This supporting face must be placed over the hole. Control means are present here in such a way that when the gripping means move out, they move towards each other. In this way the object can be gripped near the peripheral edge by the gripping means.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Device for gripping and handling objects.The invention relates to a device for gripping and handling objects with a hole, such as compact discs.Such a device is generally known in the prior art. In particular in the case of compact discs and other relatively thin objects, the problem is that they are difficult to remove from the pack and to place in the pack or elsewhere without the fragile surface containing the important information being touched. Besides, compact discs are placed in rather a tight fit in boxes, and it is often difficult to undo this clamping force. According to the instructions, such compact discs should be gripped at the edge, in order to avoid fingermarks and the like on the surface containing the information.The object of the invention is to provide a device by means of which it is simpler to grip such objects. This relates not only to the gripping of compact discs, but also to gramophone records or other objects provided with a hole which are difficult to grip in any other way.This object is achieved according to the invention with the characterizing measures according to claim 1. The invention is based on the idea that for gripping of the objects in question at least one gripping element is moved to and fro relative to the center of the disc. In that way the disc can be engaged and disengaged. Clamping of the disc by the device according to the invention can be realized in at least two ways. In one of them the gripping elements comprise gripping means engaging one side of the disc and a support face engaging another side of the disc. In this embodimen except from the movement to and fro from the center of the hole by the gripping means, these gripping means can also move relative to the support face in a direction of the thickness of the object to be engaged. In another embodiment it is possible to realize the gripping elements in that they comprise jaws having an opening to engage the circumferential edge of the opening. In this embodiment it is not necessary to move the gripping elements in another direction than to and from the center of the opening of the hole. Whilst at least one of the gripping means is movable the other gripping means can be in the form of a fixed supporting part which grips the edge of the object in question over its thickness or grips round it. 

 All gripping elements are, however, preferably in the form of a gripping means.The control means for the gripping means are preferably disposed on the end of the carrier away from the gripping means. In order

CLAIMS
1. Device (1,20) for gripping and handling objects with a hole, such as compact discs, characterised in that it comprises a carrier (2,22) to be placed above the object at the hole, which carrier near the its extremity (3,28) directed to the object is provided with at least two gripping members lying at a distance from each other and projecting outwards relative to the extremity, in order to grip the peripheral edge of the hole, while at least one gripping member comprises gripping elements which are at least displaceable relative to the extremity by control means (10,21) in order to reduce the distance between the individual gripping members when the gripping means move outwards.
2. Device according to claim 1, wherein the gripping elements comprise gripping means to be positioned one side of the disc and a cooperating support face (3) of the carrier to be placed on the other side of the disc, wherein the gripping means are displaceable to engage the disc between the supporting face and gripping means.
3. Device according to claim 1, wherein the gripping elements comprise jaws (25) having an opening (27) to engage the peripheral edge.
4. Device according to one of thr preceding claims, in which at least two opposite gripping means are present.
5. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the carrier at the end away from the supporting face comprises control means (13,21) connected to the gripping means.
6. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the control means comprise a cam surface (11) disposed on the gripping means, and interacting with a support (12) fixed on the carrier.
7. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the gripping means comprise a sleeve-shaped element (14) provided with recesses (15), in order to bound fingers (16). 8. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which spring means (17) are present in order to move the gripping means into the position inserted in the carrier.
9. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the gripping means are provided at the gripping ends with outward projecting barbed means (18) .
10. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which centring means (21) are present on the supporting face. 


 AMENDED CLAIMS
[received by the International Bureau on 15 March 1993 (15.03.93; original claims 1-10 replaced by amended claims 1-7 (1 page)]
1. Device (1,20) for gripping and handling objects with a hole, such as compact discs, comprising a carrier (2,22) to be placed against the object at the hole, which carrier near its extremity (3,28) directed to the object is provided with at least two gripping fingers (16), which can be displaced relative to each other in radial direction of the hole to be engaged, in order to grip the peripheral edge of said hole with outwardly directed barbed means (18) at their free extremities, wherein at least one finger (16) is displaceable by control means (10), characterized in that at least one finger (16) is arranged displaceable in axial direction relative to the hole of the object to be engaged and in that the control means (10) comprises cooperating cam means on both the carrier and said finger (16).
2. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which at least two opposite gripping means are present.
3. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the control means comprise a cam surface (11) disposed on the gripping means, and interacting with a support (12) fixed on the carrier.
4. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the gripping means comprise a sleeve-shaped element (14) provided with recesses (15). in order to bound fingers (16).
5- Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which spring means (17) are present in order to move the gripping means into the position inserted in the carrier.
6. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which the gripping means are provided at the gripping ends with outward projecting barbed means (18).
7. Device according to one of the preceding claims, in which centring means (21) are present on the supporting face.
