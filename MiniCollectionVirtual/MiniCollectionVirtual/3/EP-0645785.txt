<ABSTRACT>
An electronic circuit is proposed, in which resistors Ro...Rn+m connected in series with fuses Q0...Qn+m are provided, at least one fuse Q0...Qn+m being bridged by means of an additional resistor Rn+1', Rn+m'. The fuses Q0...Qn+m can be changed from a conducting state into a non-conducting state. This means that the admittance Ytotal of the electronic circuit can be set by means of specific blowing of individual fuses Q0...Qn+m.
