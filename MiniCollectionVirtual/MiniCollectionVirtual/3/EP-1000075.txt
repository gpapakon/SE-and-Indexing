<ABSTRACT>
C-nucleosides are synthesized by a method in which a sugar is derivatized in a single step to provide a heterocycle at the C1 position, and then the heterocycle is aromatized in another single step. In one class of preferred embodiments a cyano sugar is converted into thiocarboxamide, and subsequently condensed to form an azole ring. In a second class of preferred embodiments a cyano sugar is condensed with an amino acid to provide the azole ring. In a third class of preferred embodiments a halo sugar is condensed with a preformed heterocycle to provide the azole ring.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD OF PRODUCING TIAZOFURIN AND OTHER C-NUCLEOSIDESBackgroundC-Nucleosides are interesting compounds having potential activity as pharmaceutical agents. One of these compounds, Tiazofurin. [6, 2-(Î²-D-ribofuranosyl)thiazole-4- carboxamide)], possesses significant activity against both human lymphoid. F. Earle and R. I. Glazer, Cancer Res., 1983, 43 133). lung tumor cell lines (D. N. Carnex. G. S. Abluwalia, H. N. Jayaram, D. A. Cooney and D. G. Johns, J. Clin. Invest.. 1985, 75 175) and murine- implanted human ovarian cancers (J. P. Micha. P. R. Kucera, C. N. Preve, M.A. Rettenmaier, J. A. Stratton, P. J. DiSaia, Gynecol Oncol. 1985, 21, 351). Tiazofurin also demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of acute mycloid leukemia (G. T. Tricot, H N. Jasyaram C. R. Nichols, K. Pennington, E. Lapis, G. Weber and R. Hoffman, Cancer Res. 1997, 47 4988). In addition, recent findings has brought interest in Tiazofurin as a possible treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blast crisis (G. Weber, United States Patent, 5.405,837; 1995). In the cells Tiazofurin is converted to its active metabolite, thiazole-4- carboxaimde adenine dinucleotide (TAD) which inhibits IMP dehydrogenase, and as a result depletes guanosine nucleotide pools. (E. Olah, Y. Natusmeda, T. Ikegami, Z. Kote, M. Horanyi, I Szelenye, E. Paulik, T. Kremmer. S. R. Hollan, J. Sugar and G. Weber, Proc. Natl Acad Sci USA, 1988, 85, 6533).Although Tiazofurin has been known for over 15 years, and is currently under phaseII/III trials in humans, there is no suitable synthesis for large scale production. Tiazofurin was first synthesized independently by M. Fuertes et al. (J. Org. Chem., 1976, 4 .. 4076) and Srivastava et al. (J. Med. Chem., 1977, 20, 256) in low yield. In both methods the authors obtained side products (i.e. compound 12) and used column chromatography at each stage to purify the products. The principal disadvantage of these methods is the formation of the furan derivative as well as the utility of highly toxic hydrogen sulfide gas.W. J. Harmon et al. (J. Org. Chem., 1985, 50, 1741) developed a somewhat different route for Tiazofurin in 19% yield. The Harmon method also suffers from low yield, the use H2S gas and chromatographic purifications. More recently P. Vogel et al. (Helv. Chem. Acta., 1989, 72, 1825) synthesized Tiazofurin in nine steps with 25% yield. Still more recently, D. C. Humber et al. (J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1, 1990, 283) worked a synthesis for Tiazofurin starting from benzyl (2,3,5-tri-O-benzyoyl-
