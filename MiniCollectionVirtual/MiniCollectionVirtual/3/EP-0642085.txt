<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to electronic circuits and more particularly
relates to sampling circuits for circuit testing.In integrated circuits, circuit performance is verified through
functional and parametric testing. For example, a series of voltage values are
placed on circuit inputs and the outputs are examined to see whether the
circuit is functioning appropriately. Additionally, supply currents, signal
transition times and other characteristics are measured to ensure each
circuit meets the parametric specifications required by the customer. As
circuits become faster, test mechanisms must become more creative to ensure
that high speed data transfers are error free.FIG.1 is a prior art diagram illustrating a portion of a video driver
circuit 10. Video driver circuit 10 consists of a data source 12, typically pixel
data, a bus 13, a control circuit 14, a second bus 15, and a digital-to-analog
converter (DAC) 16. Control circuit 14 may include internal multiplexing
that ramps up the speed of internal operations on chip so that incoming pixel
rates can be reduced, RAM look-up tables, and additional switching circuitry
that is common in video drivers. Control circuit 14 provides DAC 16 with a
multiple bit code (or "word") that reflects a desired color intensity via bus 15.
DAC 16 converts the bit code into an analog voltage that reflects the desired
color intensity. In the past, because transfer speeds were slow (<50 Mhz) and 
control circuitry 14 was simple, high speed data transfers were guaranteed
by design and were not tested. As data transfer speeds have increased (75-200
Mhz) and control circuitry 14 has increased greatly in complexity it has
become necessary to test the integrity of data transfers.Data cannot simply be directly ported to an ATE (automated test
equipment) at high frequencies because the circuit of FIG.1 would need
additional drivers to drive the high frequency data over an inductive cable to
the ATE. Furthermore, an ATE that can read data at high frequencies is
much more expensive than low frequency testers.A common prior art method of testing the integrity of data transfers is
to digitize the analog voltage of DAC 16 and compare the digitized voltage
value to the expected voltage. This is typically performed by transferring all
"0"'s and "1"'s to obtain a black/white color pattern (square wave) at the DAC
output. However, this is a slow test to perform and therefore is expensive.
Additionally, the resolution of the digitizing technique is not great enough to
ensure transfer accuracy
