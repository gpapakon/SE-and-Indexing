signal of a disc player, an audio tape recorder, a tuner, or
an amplifier, etc. provides control circuits. A plurality

of operation buttons are composed of: basic operation
buttons for basic action of the electronic equipment, such

as starting or stopping reproducing of the reproducing unit
of a recording medium, music selection, and tuner selection

and switching volume adjusting operation of an amplifier;
additional function buttons associated with basic operation,

such as random reproducing of a reproducing unit of a
recording medium, adjusting of equalizing characteristic,

and switching adjusting operation of tone quality or sound
field, etc.. The control circuits are provided in the

electronic equipment, and in the normal operation mode,
switches overall operation in response to operation of both

basic action and additional function buttons. When the
simple operation button is operated, the control circuit

switches overall operation mode to simple operation mode to
switch overall operation in response to basic operation

button, and do not accept operation of additional function

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronic
equipment and control method thereof, and more particularly,
to the electronic equipment which can be operated easily and
the method for controlling it.In a conventional audio equipment in which a disc
player unit, a tuner unit, and a tape recorder unit are
unified, various functions are added to make it convenient
to use.That is, the disc player unit can select
reproduction mode, such as program reproduction where
performances specified previously by user are reproduced
sequentially, repeat reproduction where a desired
performance is reproduced repeatedly, and random
reproduction. The tape recorder unit can select dubbing or
timer recording in cooperation with the tuner unit.In addition, the amplifier unit switches the
operation of a built-in digital signal processor when
processing audio signal from the disc player unit, the tape
recorder unit, and the tuner unit to output reproduced
sounds, thereby various sound fields can be generated and
the tone quality can be adjusted freely.Therefore, the users who are so called "audio
freaks" can be satisfied with this kind of audio equipment.However, if various functions are added to audio
equipment, it is impossible to avoid increasing the number
of operation buttons (e.g. switches) so that inexperienced
users have difficulty operating such equipment.More specifically, inexperienced users may not be
able to operate such equipment at all.One solution to this problem is to remove the
plural functions to reduce operation buttons in order that
inexperienced users can operate easily. However, if several functions are removed, the
equipment may not appeal to audio freaks because it does
not have the functionality they desire.If these contrary problems could be solved, audio
equipment could appeal to inexperienced users and audio
freaks at the same time.It is, therefore, an object of the present invention
to provide an electronic equipment and method of
operating it which resolves the above-mentioned problem.It is another object of the present invention to
provide a method for controlling an electronic equipment
which resolves the above-mentioned problem.GB 2,164,512-A discloses a radio apparatus in which
the programming functions can be disabled by switching a
switch actuated by a key or magnetic card. This allows
an unskilled operator to use the device without a
possibility of incidentally disrupting the program set-up.EP 0,512,206-A discloses an electronic device in
which the buttons may be used in the stand-by mode
