<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to copper, stannous and zinc 
salts o
f polyhydroxy compounds having at least one acid, 
ester-linked salt-forming substituent. These salts have 

anti-bacterial activity and are useful for inclusion in 
personal care compositions, particularly in oral care 

compositions, to impart anti-plaque, anti-caries, anti-gingivitis 
properties thereto. Several of these salts are 

novel compounds; typical examples are stannous and copper 
salts of glucose-6-phosphate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to copper, stannous and zinc 
salts of polyhydroxy compounds having at least one acid, 
ester-linked salt-forming substituent, having utility as 
therapeutically active ingredient in personal care 
compositions, particularly oral care compositions. More particularly, the present invention related to copper, 
stannous and zinc salts of polyhydroxy compounds having at 
least 4 C-atoms, having at least one acid, ester linked 
salt-forming substituent, particularly saccharides having 
at least 4 carbon atoms, and to their utility as 
therapeutically active ingredients in oral care products. Copper salts with a great variety of anions are known in 
the art as anti-plaque agents. Thus, US Patent 4,332,791 
(Raaf et al) discloses quite a number of copper salts, 
including copper salts of organic acids such as copper 
citrate, copper lactate, copper gluconate and copper 
glycerophosphate. Similarly, stannous salts with a great variety of anions 
have been described as anti-caries or anti-plaque agents in 
oral care products. Thus, e.g. in our EP 0,426,213 we have 
described many stannous salts with organic anions such as 
stannous gluconate, stannous citrate, stannous tartrate, 
having utility as anti-plaque agents in oral care products. In EP 0,311,259, stannous gluconate in combination with 
stannous fluoride is disclosed for anti-staining anti-plaque 
and anti-gingivitis benefits. Equally, zinc salts with a great variety of anions are 
well-known in the art as anti-plaque agents in oral care 
products. Thus, our above EP 0,426,213 also discloses a  
 
variety of zinc salts of organic acids such as zinc 
citrate, zinc glycerophosphate, zinc lactate, zinc tartrate 
as anti-plaque agents. While it is primarily the copper-, stannous- or zinc cation 
which is responsible for the therapeutic activity of the 
copper-, stannous- or zinc compound, the anion nevertheless 
may also play an important role as regards stability, 
solubility, substantivity and overall efficacy of the 
compound. We have now surprisingly found that copper-, stannous- or 
zinc salts of polyhydroxy compounds having at least 4 
carbon-atoms and having at least one acid, ester-linked 
salt-forming substituent provide for improved anti-caries, 
anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis effects as compared with 
other copper-, stannous- or zinc salt. Furthermore, they 
are useful as anti-microbial agents in a variety of other 
products for personal care, such as deodorant-, anti-perspirant-, 
skin care-, hair care- and cosmetic
