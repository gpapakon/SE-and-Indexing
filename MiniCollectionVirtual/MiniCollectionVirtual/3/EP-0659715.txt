<ABSTRACT>
A gas generant composition contains as a fuel a mixture of a 
major portion of a triazole or tetrazole and a minor portion of a 

water soluble fuel; and an oxidizer component, at least 20 wt% of 
said oxidizer component being a transition metal oxide, such as 

CuO. Generant compositions in accordance with the invention 
autoignite in a range around 170째C, providing autoignition of the 

generant without the need for separate autoignition devices. 
Also, the generant compositions are useful as autoignition 

pyrotechnic in autoignition devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present Invention is directed to gas generant
compositions for inflating automotive airbags and other devices
in which rapid production of high volumes of gas is required.
More particularly, the invention is directed to such compositions
where tetrazoles and triazoles are the fuel component and
oxidizers are selected to achieve a low combustion temperature so
as to minimize production of toxic oxides during combustion.Most automotive air bag restraint systems, presently in use,
use gas generant compositions in which sodium azide is the
principal fuel. Because of disadvantages with sodium azide,
particularly instability in the presence of metallic impurities
and toxicity, which presents a disposal problem for unfired gas
generators, there is a desire to develop non-azide gas generant
systems, and a number of non-azide formulations have been
proposed. However, to date, non-azide gas generants have not
made significant commercial inroads.Alternatives to azides which have been proposed, e.g., in
US-A-5,035,757,
include azole compounds,
including tetrazole and triazole compounds. Tetrazole compounds
include 5-amino tetrazole (AT), tetrazole, bitetrazole and metal
salts of these compounds. Triazole compounds include 1,2,4-triazole-5-one,
3-nitro 1,2,4-triazole-5-one and metal salts of
these compounds. Although all of the above azole compounds are
useful fuels in accordance with the present invention, AT is the
most commercially important of these. Gas generant systems include, in addition to the fuel
component, an oxidizer. Proposed oxidizers for use in
conjunction with azole fuels include alkali and alkaline earth
metal salts of nitrates, chlorates and perchlorates. A problem
with azole compound-based gas generant systems, heretofore
proposed, is their high combustion temperatures. Generated
levels of toxic oxides, particularly CO and NOx depend upon the
combustion temperature of the gas-generating reaction, higher
levels of these toxic gases being produced at higher
temperatures. Accordingly, it is desirable to produce gas
generant mixtures which burn at lower temperatures.Several gas generant processing procedures utilize water.
Water-processing reduces hazards of processing gas generant
materials. It is therefore desirable that gas generant
compositions be formulated so as to facilitate water processing.One example of water processing, taught, e.g., in
US-A-5,015,309,
involves the steps of
1. Forming a slurry of the generant ingredients with
water.2. Spray drying the slurry to form spherical prills
