<ABSTRACT>
Recombinantly expressed measles antigens provide practical and accurate measles diagnostic assays. The baculovirus expression system is efficacious for producing measles antigens for the assays. Measles nucleoprotein produced using the baculovirus system is particularly useful.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the detection of 
measles-specific IgG and IgM antibodies using measles 
antigens produced by recombinant DNA techniques. The 
expressed measles antigens maintain reactivity with 
immunoglobulins from patients infected with measles and 
are produced by expressing cloned genes in alternative 
hosts. These antigens are then used in place of whole 
measles virus preparations or derivatives thereof in 
assays to detect anti-measles antibodies in patients 
potentially exposed to the virus. The antigens 
preferably are immobilized on a surface, directly or 
indirectly as in sandwich assays, and then incubated with 
a serum sample. Antigen-binding immunoglobulins in the 
serum are detected by labelled antibody binding reagents 
such as anti-human immunoglobulin secondary antibodies. 
A recombinant baculovirus system is preferred for 
production of measles antigens, and the nucleoprotein 
gene of measle virus expressed in such a system is 
particularly preferred in the assays of the invention. Measles is a major health problem in the world. This 
is true especially in developing countries, which 
worldwide report an estimated 70 million cases each year 
that cause the death of 2 million children. Within the United States, eradication of measles 
remains elusive despite the implementation of vaccine 
regimens since 1963. As a result of vaccine failure or 
failure to vaccinate, over 27,000 measles cases were 
reported in 1990 in the U.S., 50% more than in 1989 and  
 
nearly ten times the number reported in 1988. Centers 
for Disease Control (1990) Morbid. Mortal. Weekly Rep.39: 353-363. Due to the continuing worldwide problem of measles 
and the resurgence of measles in the United States 
(together with its frequent complications), there is a 
continuing need for improved methods of preventing and 
treating measles, and concomitantly for improved methods 
of diagnosis. Current technology for measles virus detection 
includes the use of whole virus as antigen in an enzyme 
immunoassay format. Commercial diagnostic tests such as 
"MEASELISA" and "MEASLESTAT M," supplied by Whittaker 
Bioproducts, Inc., are available for the detection of IgG 
and IgM antibodies, respectively, and employ the 
Edmonston vaccine strain of measles virus grown in MK-2 
cells as whole virus antigen. Boteler et al. (1983) J. 
Clin. Microbiol.17: 814-818. A capture IgM EIA of similar design has recently been 
described that also uses the Edmonston strain, grown in 
E-6 Vero cells, as an assay antigen.

<CLAIMS>
An immunoassay method, for the detection of measles-specific 
immunoglobulin in a human serum sample, comprising 

the steps of: 

(i) contacting the sample with an immobilised 
recombinant measles nucleoprotein antigen 

under conditions that 
permit binding of the immunoglobulin and the immobilised 

antigen; and 
(ii) detecting the presence of measles-specific 
immunoglobulin bound to the immobilised antigen. 
A capture immunoassay method, for the detection of 
measles-specific
 immunoglobulin IgM in a human serum 
sample, comprising the steps of: 


(i) contacting the sample with immobilised purified 
anti-human IgM capture antibody, under conditions that 

permit binding of the IgM and the immobilised antibody; 
(ii) contacting the captured IgM with a recombinant 
measles nucleoprotein, 

under conditions sufficient to 
permit binding of the nucleoprotein and the captured IgM; 

and 
(iii) detecting the presence of nucleoprotein bound to 
the captured IgM. 
The method of claim 2, wherein step (iii) comprises 
contacting the IgM-bound nucleoprotein with an anti-nucleoprotein 

monoclonal antibody bound to a detectable 
label, under conditions sufficient to permit binding 

therebetween, and detecting the presence of bound label. 
The method of claim 2 or claim 3, wherein the capture 
antibody is immobilised by indirect fixation to a plate 

surface. 
The method of claim 1, wherein the antigen is 
immobilised by indirect fixation to a surface.  

 
The method of any preceding claim, wherein the 
nucleoprotein is expressed by a cell transfected with a 

recombinant DNA sequence comprising a baculovirus 
polyhedrin promoter operably linked to a DNA molecule 

encoding the nucleoprotein. 
The method of claim 6, wherein the cell is 
Spodoptera 
frugiperda
. 
The method of claim 6, wherein the cell is transfected 
with a recombinant DNA sequence comprising plasmid 

pAcYM1S-MVN.
