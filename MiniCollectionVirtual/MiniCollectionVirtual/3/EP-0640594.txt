<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel hydantoin 
derivative having an inhibitory activity on metalloprotease. In general, a series of proteases of which a metal 
such as Zn, Ca or Co plays an important role in expression of 
their enzymatic activities or maintenance of their structures 
are classified as metalloprotease. There are various kinds of metalloproteases in 
mammalia and each of them plays its respective important 
role. For example, carboxypeptidase A (which takes part in 
digestion and absorption of dietary protein in mammals), 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE; EC 3.4.15.1) (which takes 
part in the biosynthesis of angiotensin II which is a potent 
vasoconstrictor), neutral metalloendopeptidase (NEP; EC 
3.4.24.11) (which takes part in the metabolic degradation of 
in vivo peripheral hormones or neuropeptides) and collagenase 
(which takes part in the metabolic degradation of collagen 
which is an important constituent of cartilaginous matrix) 
are known as a metalloprotease. In addition, it has recently 
been revealed that the endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) 
(which takes part in the biosynthesis of endothelin I which 
is a potent vasoconstrictor) is also one kind of 
metalloproteases.  As described above, it is considered that 
metalloprotease contributes to the biosynthesis and metabolic 
degradation of various hormones, neurotransmitters and the 
like which posses a potent physiological functions, and hence 
plays an important role to keep homeostasis in mammalia. Accordingly, there is a possibility that inhibitors 
of these metalloproteases are useful as treating drugs for 
diseases induced by anomalies of hormones or neurotransmitters. Among these metalloproteases, NEP is an enzyme which 
is widely distributed in mammalia and known that it 
metabolically degrades circulatory peptide hormones such as 
atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and endogenous opioid 
peptides (e.g., endorphins, enkephalins), thereby 
inactivating these peptide hormones. Endorphins and enkephalins are polypeptides and 
pentapeptides, respectively, and both of them bind with the 
opioid receptor in the brain, thereby raising the threshold 
of pain and expressing an analgesic effect. ANP is a peptide 
composed of 28 amino acids which is excreted from the atrium. 
Its physiological action includes vasodilation, natriuresis, 
and diuretic action, which are important for the 
physiological control of blood pressure, body fluid, and 
electrolytes. Consequently, it is expected that an inhibitor of NEP 
is useful
