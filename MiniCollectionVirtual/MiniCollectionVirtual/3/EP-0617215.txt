<ABSTRACT>
An electrohydraulic control device (76) for a drive 
train (10) of a vehicle (12) including an engine (14), a 

transmission (32), a source of pressurized fluid, and an 
input clutch (64) driving connected between the engine (14) 

and the transmission (32). The device (76) includes a 
control lever (82) or handle having a control member 

progressively manually movable between first and second 
positions, wherein the transmission (32) is adapted to 

responsibly shift between a FORWARD and a REVERSE gear 
ratio in response to movement of the control member (82) 

from the first position to the second position. An 
electronic control module (78) is adapted to determine a 

transmission clutch relative speed as a function of the 
transmission output speed and the transmission input speed 

and responsively engage and disengage the input clutch (64) 
during a directional shift.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to an 
electrohydraulic control device and method for controllably 
operating a vehicle, and more particularly to an 
electrohydraulic control device having an electronic 
control module and one or more manually operated actuator 
mechanisms for affecting certain modes of operation of the 
drive line of the vehicle through the electronic control 
module including the engagement of a torque converter input 
clutch. In one conventional mode of "inching" of a vehicle the 
transmission is kept in gear and the brakes are manually 
modulated by use of a foot pedal. This is undesirable 
because it requires considerable operator effort and 
because the service brakes experience a relatively rapid 
rate of wear. In another well known mode, when the 
vehicle's service brakes are applied by the depression of 
a foot pedal and associated disc and plate type 
transmission clutch is caused to slip so that the 
transmission is substantially neutralized. This is most 
often accomplished by the brake system fluid circuit acting 
upon an "inching" valve disposed between a pressure source 
and the clutch, as has been widely used in shuttle-type 
lift trucks. This is desirable since the vehicle's ground 
speed is reduced for more precise control, while the speed 
of the engine is maintained at a relatively high rate to 
enable a rapid response of the auxiliary equipment operated 
by the engine. However, controlled slip at a fixed setting 
of the manually operated control member in both of these 
modes of operation has heretofore been impractical. The interconnection between the service brake pedal 
and a clutch pedal can be done mechanically, but this 
requires rather critical adjustments to function properly. 
US-A-2,972,906, for example, discloses a left foot pedal  
 
that mechanically operates a spool of a valve for 
decreasing the pressure delivered to a clutch in order to 
controllably slip it. A right foot pedal is independently 
depressible to solely engage the service brakes, and the 
left foot pedal is mechanically connected to the right foot 
pedal after some free travel of the left foot pedal to 
depress it and cause the application of the service brakes 
after some clutch slippage. US-A-3,181,667 is illustrative of another double pedal 
system for automatically neutralizing a vehicle's 
transmission with the application of the service brakes. 
Depression of the right brake pedal causes application of 
the service brakes, whereas depression of the left brake 
pedal causes
