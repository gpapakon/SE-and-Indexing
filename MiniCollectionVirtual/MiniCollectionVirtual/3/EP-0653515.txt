Method and dryer section in contact-drying of a 
paper web (W). The paper web (W) is dried by 

means of heated smooth-faced drying cylinders (10, 
20A,20B) by using a number of successive so-called 

normal groups (R₁...R
N
) with single-wire draw, in 
which the drying cylinders (10) are placed in the 

upper row and the reversing suction cylinders (11) 
in the lower row. After the press section of the 

paper machine, the paper web (W) is dried initially 
in a number of successive groups (R₁...R
N
) with 
single-wire draw by pressing the paper web (W) by 

means of the drying wire (15) of the cylinder group 
against the heated faces of the drying cylinders (10) 

and by, in each group (R₁...R
N
) with single-wire 
draw, passing the paper web (W) on support of the 

same drying wire (15) from one drying cylinder 
(10) onto the other drying cylinder over reversing 

suction cylinders (11) or rolls. By means of the 
groups (R₁...R
N
) with single-wire draw, the paper 
web (W) is dried to a dry solids content of k₁ = 

70...92 %. After the drying steps which were 
carried out exclusively by means of normal groups 

(R₁...R
N
) with single-wire draw, the paper web (W) 
is dried immediately further by means of one single 

group (R
TW
) with twin-wire draw to its ultimate dry 
solids content.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method in contact-drying of a paper web, wherein the 
paper web is dried by means of heated smooth-faced drying cylinders by using a 
number of successive so-called normal groups with single-wire draw, in which the 
drying cylinders are placed in the upper row and the reversing suction cylinders or 
corresponding reversing suction rolls in the lower row, in which method, after the 
press section of the paper machine, the paper web is dried initially in a number of 
successive groups with single-wire draw by pressing the paper web by means of the 
drying wire of the cylinder group against the heated faces of the drying cylinders 
and by, in each group with single-wire draw, passing the paper web on support of 
the same drying wire from one drying cylinder onto the next drying cylinder over 
reversing suction cylinders, and in which method, after the above drying steps, 
which were carried out exclusively by means of normal groups with single-wire 
draw, the paper web is dried immediately further by means of one single group with 
twin-wire draw to its ultimate dry solids content. Further, the invention concerns a dryer section of a paper machine, whose initial 
part is composed of a number of successive so-called normal groups with single-wire 
draw, in which the drying cylinders are placed in the upper row and the reversing 
suction cylinders or corresponding suction rolls are placed in the lower row, and 
between which said normal groups the paper web to be dried has closed draws over 
the group gaps, and which said reversing suction cylinders have been arranged to be 
subjected to negative pressure, at least at their drying-wire turning sectors, and in 
which dryer section, after the last group with single-wire draw, one single group 
with twin-wire draw is provided, in which there are two rows of drying cylinders, 
one row placed above the other. In the way known from prior art, in multi-cylinder dryers of paper machines, twin-wire 
draw and/or single-wire draw is/are employed. In twin-wire draw, the groups  
 
of drying cylinders include two wires, which press the web, one from above and the 
other one from below, against the heated cylinder faces. Between the rows of drying 
cylinders, which are usually horizontal rows, the web has free and unsupported 
draws, which are susceptible of fluttering, which may again cause web breaks, in 
particular since the web is still relatively moist and, therefore, of low strength. This 
is why, in recent years, increasing use has been
