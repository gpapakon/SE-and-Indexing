<ABSTRACT>
In this method for installing the deck (1) of an off-shore platform for a support structure (3) with the aid of a ballastable barge (2) and with the aid of several cylinder and a plunger-piston assemblies (14, 15), it is possible to avoid impacts between pistons (14) and support structure (3) and between the legs (6) of the deck (1) and the support structure (3), which impacts would be due to the vertical movements of the deck brought about by the swell during deck fitting operations, by providing in each leg (6), a low-pressure hydraulic fluid accumulator (17), it being possible for first means (24) to be operated in order to establish a two-way high-flow rate communication between the accumulator (17) and one chamber (16) of a cylinder (15), it being possible for second means (24) to be operated in order to establish a one-way high-flow rate communication from the accumulator (17) towards the chamber (16), and it being possible for third means (25, 35) to be operated in order to establish a low-flow rate communication between the chamber (16) and a hydraulic fluid reservoir (26).

platform on a support structure (3) at sea, said deck 

including a plurality of vertical tubular legs (6) each 
containing a hydraulic cylinder and plunger piston 

assembly (15, 14), said support structure (3) including a 
number of vertical tubular members (8) and/or of piles 

(5) corresponding to the number of legs (6) of the deck 
(1), each vertical member or pile including at its top 

end a receiver portion (7) suitable for receiving the 
bottom end of the plunger piston (14) associated with a 

leg (6) of the deck, the method comprising the following 
operations: 


a) bringing a barge (2) between the vertical members 
(8) or piles (5) of the support structure (3), with the 

deck (1) supported on the barge by a plurality of 
retractable supports (9); 
b) positioning and holding the barge (2) in such a 
manner that the legs (6) of the deck (1) are and remain 

substantially in alignment with the corresponding 
vertical members (8) or piles (5) of the support 

structure (3); 
c) lowering the plunger pistons (14) until their 
bottom ends come into abutment against the receiver 

portions (7) of the corresponding members (8) or piles 
(5) of the support structure (3); 
d) ballasting the barge (2) to lower it and transfer 
the load of the deck (1) to the support structure (3); 
e) subsequently retracting the supports (9) situated 
between the deck (1) and the barge (2) so that the deck 

is supported solely by the support structure (3); 
f) making rigid connections between the legs (6) of 
the deck (1) and the vertical members (8) or piles (5) of 

the support structure (3); and 
g) evacuating the barge (2) from between said 
vertical members (8) or piles (5); 
  
 

   characterized in that it consists, for operation c), 
in allowing the plunger pistons (14) to descend under 

their own weight, while establishing large flow rate 
bidirectional communication between a low pressure 

hydraulic fluid accumulator (17) and a chamber (16) in 
the top portion of each hydraulic cylinder (15) above the 

plunger pistons (14) so as to bring each of the plunger 
pistons into contact with the receiver portion (7) of the 

corresponding vertical member (8) or pile (5) of the 
support structure (3); 


h) then, during an observation stage, allowing the 
barge (2), the deck (1), and the hydraulic cylinders (15) 

to oscillate vertically with the swell relative to the 
plunger pistons (14) bearing against said corresponding 

receiver portions (7), while leaving said bidirectional 
communication open; 
i) then establishing high flow rate communication 
that is unidirectional only from said low pressure 

accumulator (17) to said chamber (16) in each hydraulic 
cylinder (15) so as to prevent any downwards movement of 

the deck (1) and of the hydraulic cylinders (15), but 
without preventing any upwards movement thereof and 

without preventing the chamber (16) filling with 
hydraulic fluid should there pass beneath the barge (2) a 

wave having its crest at a level that is higher than the 
level that the water occupied at the moment when 

unidirectional communication was established; 
j) subsequently performing operations d) and e); 
k) subsequently establishing low flow rate 
communication from said chamber (16) of each hydraulic 

cylinder (15) to a hydraulic fluid reservoir (26) so as
