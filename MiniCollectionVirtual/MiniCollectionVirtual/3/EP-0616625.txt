<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to fluorescent pigment 
concentrates for use in a variety of polymers. The 
concentrates incorporate a low molecular weight 
ethylene-carbon monoxide copolymer which provides 
improved resistance to plate-out. Fluorescent pigments or daylight fluorescent 
pigments have been produced commercially since the late 
1940's for use in paints, printing inks, and plastics. 
US patent literature from 1938 forward describes the 
preparation and use of various fluorescent pigments. 
Patton, in his Pigment Handbook, (Volume 1, pp 891-903) 
describes the chemistry, the production, the properties, 
the major uses, and some of the limitations of 
fluorescent pigments. An early advancement in the use 
of fluorescent colorants for plastics is described in 
U.S. Patent 2,119,189 in which Widmer taught the use of 
a resinous molecule as a carrier or suitable medium for 
fluorescent dyes. Later, Switzer, Kazenas, and others 
utilized extremely friable organic glass-like compounds 
as carriers for fluorescent dyes. These glass-like 
compounds included modified sulphonamide resins, urea-melamines, 
glyceryl phthalates, polyesters, polyamides, 
vinyl resins, and silica gels. U.S. Patent 3,922,232 describes a fluorescent 
colorant comprising particles of a resinous 
precondensate colored with a fluorescent dye. The 
precondensate consists of 0.5 to 2 molecules of a 
carboxylic acid, ester, or anhydride and one mole of a 
polyhydroxy compound. It is mentioned that additives, 
such as polyethylene wax and ethylene-acrylic acid  
 
copolymers, can be added to the precondensate or to the 
final colorant. The final colorant is useful for 
coloring polyethylene. U.S. Patent 4,911,830 teaches the preparation of 
fluorescent pigment concentrates by mixing about 5 to 
40 wt % fluorescent pigment, 5 to 20 wt % inorganic 
fillers, 2 to 10% silica gel or precipitated silica, 1 
to 10% dispersant comprising at least 2 of (a) oxidized 
polyethylene wax, (b) unoxidized polyethylene wax, 
(c) ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers, and (d) bivalent 
metal salts of (a) or (c) and the remainder an ethylene 
polymer of substantially higher molecular weight up to 
50% by weight. Certain types of fluorescent pigments, 
especially those useful at elevated temperatures, were 
not effective using this composition, resulting in 
excessive plate-out. Although several advancements have been made in the 
state of the art for the use of fluorescent pigments to 
color plastics, most commercial fluorescent pigment 
concentrates continue to

A low plate-out fluorescent pigment concentrate 
characterized as being a blend of: 


(a) a pigment comprising a polymer selected 
from the group consisting of polyesters, 

melamine-formaldehyde resins and 
triazine-formaldehyde resins and a 

fluorescent dye, and 
(b) a copolymer of ethylene and carbon monoxide 
having a molecular weight of 1,000 to 

100,000, said copolymer containing 
carbon monoxide residue in the amount of about 

5-30% by weight, said copolymer being present 
in sufficient amount to disperse said pigment. 
A concentrate according to Claim 1 wherein said 
pigment and said polyolefin are each present in an 

amount of 5-50% by weight based on the weight 
of the concentrate. 
A concentrate according to Claim 1 which contains, 
in addition, up to about 50% by weight of a 

compatible thermoplastic polymer as a carrier, said 
thermoplastic polymer having a molecular weight of 

10,000 to 100,000. 
A concentrate according to Claim 3 wherein said 
thermoplastic polymer is selected from the group 

consisting of polyethylene, polypropylene, 
polystyrene, polystyrene copolymers and 

terpolymers, and polyamides.  
 
Process for preparing a low plate-out fluorescent 
pigment concentrate characterized by dry blending 


(a) a pigment comprising a polymer selected from 
the group consisting of polyesters, melamine-formaldehyde 

resins and triazine-formaldehyde 
resins and a fluorescent dye, and 
(b) a copolymer of ethylene and carbon monoxide
