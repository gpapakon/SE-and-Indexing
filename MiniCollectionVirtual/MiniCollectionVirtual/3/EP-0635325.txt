<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for making a workpiece in titanium by sintering, characterised in that it consists in:     - (a) mixing a titanium hydride powder with a temporary binder, - (b) injecting the mixture obtained into a mould in order to obtain a workpiece of the desired shape,   - (c) removing the binder, - (d) heating the workpiece in a hydrogen atmosphere up to the desired sintering temperature, - (e) replacing the hydrogen atmosphere by a vacuum or a non-reactive atmosphere once the sintering temperature has been attained, and - (f) cooling the workpiece in the atmosphere of the non-reactive gas.

Process for the manufacture by sintering of a
titanium part having a porosity less than 2 %,


characterized in that
 it consists of:

(a) mixing a titanium hydride powder with a
temporary binding agent,
(b) injecting the mixture obtained into a mould
to obtain a part in the desired shape,
(c) removing the binding agent,
(d) heating the part in a hydrogen atmosphere
with a temperature gradient comprised between 50째C and

250째C per hour up to a sintering temperature comprised
between 1'000 and 1'400째C,
(e) replacing the hydrogen atmosphere by vacuum
or a non-reactive atmosphere once the sintering

temperature has been reached, and
(f) cooling the part in a non-reactive gas
atmosphere, so that a sintered titanium part is

obtained.
Process according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 step (d) is carried out for between 4 and 8 hours.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
, during step (d), the
hydrogen is supplied in the form of a continuous flow.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
, during step (e), the part
is maintained at said sintering temperature for between

5 and 60 minutes.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
, during the steps (e) and
(f), the non-reactive atmosphere is argon or helium.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 step (c) is carried out
chemically or thermally.
Process according to claim 6, 
characterized in
that
 step (c) is carried out in a vacuum at a
temperature below 300째C. 
Process according to claim 7, 
characterized in
that
 step (c) is carried out for between 6 and 9 hours.
Process according to claim 6, 
characterized in
that
 the binding agent is a thermoplastic polymer and 
in
that
 step (c) comprises the chemical decomposition of
the polymer by an acid vapour.
Process according to any one of the preceding
claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a
supplementary step (g) during the course of which the

part is subjected to specular polishing.
