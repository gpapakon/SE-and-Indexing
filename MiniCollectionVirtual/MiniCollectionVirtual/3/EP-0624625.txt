<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to polymer mixtures 
comprising a first polyalkylene phthalate, for example, 

polybutylene terephthalate, and a second polyalkylene 
phthalate and/or a thermoplastic elastomer and 

phosphorus compounds. It has been found that, with 
regard to the crystallisation behaviour, the addition of 

certain nucleating agents (namely talcum or carbon 
black) show a synergistic effect with certain phosporus 

compounds.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a polymer mixture
comprising
A. a first polyalkylene phthalate which comprises more
than 35 mol% of units derived from 1,4-butanediol
and which comprises more than 35 mol% of units
derived from terephthalic acid; andB.
B1 a second polyalkylene phthalate which comprises
less than 15 mol% of units derived from
1,4-butanediol; orB2 a thermoplastic elastomer selected from a
polyether ester block copolymer, a polyester
ester urethane and a polyether imide ester or a
mixture thereof; orB3 a mixture of B1 and B2; andC. a certain type of transesterification inhibitor as
indicated hereinafter, andD. a certain type of nucleating agent as indicated
hereinafter.The invention also relates to articles formed
from a polymer mixture according to the invention. Blends of two polyesters are generally known.EP-A-0 604 074 published on June 29, 1994 describes blends of a
relatively low molecular weight polybutylene terephthalate resin, a
relatively high molecular weight polyester resin and a melt viscosity
stabilizer. The known blends may comprise further additives like glass
fibers, talc, mica, clay of mixtures thereof. The high molecular weight
resin and the melt viscosity stabilizers can be chosen among a variety of
possibilities.EP-A-0 604 080 published on June 29, 1994 describes compositions
which comprise polybutylene terephthalate and/or polyethylene
terephthalate, a polycarbonate, a stabilizer and an inorganic filler selected
from barium sulfate, strontium sulfate, zirconium oxide and zinc sulfate.EP-A-0 609 538 published on August 10, 1994 describes polymer
mixtures comprising two polyesters and a transesterification inhibitor.
The known mixtures may comprise carbon black.US-A-4,111,892 describes compositions comprising polybutylene
terephthalate (which can be admixed with another polymer which can be
polyethylene terephthalate), a flame reatardant combination of a halogen
containing compound, hydrated silica and a reinforcing filler. The
reinforcing filler can comprise talc and a second reinforcing filler. The
talc and the hydated silica are added to improve the electrical
characteristics of the composition.GB-A-1 060 401 describes the use of phosphorus compounds like for
example diammonium hydrogen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen
phosphate, magnesium hydrogen phosphate and manganese hydrogen
phosphate. The hydrogen phosphates just mentioned have for their
disadvantage that they negatively influence the mechanical properties, for
example, the tensile strength and the impact strength. The
