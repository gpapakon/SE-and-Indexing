<ABSTRACT>
A transmitter (100) of a radio communication apparatus 
includes means (17) for converting a signal (S1) input to 

the transmitter into a signal (S11) having a frequency 
according to its voltage, means (15,16) for mixing a signal 

(S12) having a prescribed frequency with the converted input 
signal (S11) and generating a signal for transmission (S13) 

having a frequency at which communication is substantially 
carried out, means (19) for detecting the frequency at which 

communication is substantially carried out from the signal 
for transmission, and means (100a) for eliminating useless 

signals that are included in the signal for transmission and 
have frequencies different from the frequency at which 

communication is substantially carried out, according to the 
detected frequency. Therefore, signals having frequencies 

different from the frequency at which communication is 
substantially carried out are not radiated to space. As a 

result, this radio communication apparatus does not cause 
noises in other communication apparatuses of the same kind 

and using communication frequencies different from that of 
this apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a radio communication 
apparatus and, more particularly, to a transmitter included 
in the radio communication apparatus that does not transmit 
signals having frequencies other than specific frequencies 
at which the radio communication is carried out. Figure 17 is a circuit diagram illustrating a 
transmitter of a conventional radio communication apparatus. 
In figure 17, a voltage controlled oscillator 17 receives an 
input signal S1 and outputs a signal S11 having a frequency 
in proportion to the voltage. A frequency synthesizer 16 
generates a signal S12 for converting the signal S11 into a 
signal having a frequency to be transmitted. The signal S11 
from the voltage controlled oscillator 17 and the signal S12 
from the frequency synthesizer are input to a mixer 15. The 
mixer 15 compounds these signals and outputs a signal S13 to 
a voltage amplifier 14. The voltage amplifier 14 amplifies 
the signal S13 and outputs a signal S14. The signal S14 
passes through a filter 13. The filter 13 eliminates signal 
component of unnecessary frequency from the signal S14 and 
outputs a signal S14a. The signal S14a is radiated into 
space from an aerial 11 as a signal S2. A transmit-receive 
switch (hereinafter referred to as TR switch) 12 is  
 
interposed between the filter 13 and the aerial 11. In radio communication system, communication 
apparatuses of different kinds have different frequency 
bands for the communication (hereinafter referred to as 
usable frequency bands). If an automobile telephone having 
a usable frequency band ranging from 900 MHz to 920 MHz 
transmits signals having frequencies outside this range, 
these signals cause a noise of a radio communication 
apparatus having a usable frequency band including the 
frequencies. On the other hand, in radio communication using the 
same radio communication apparatuses, each person uses his 
own frequency range in the usable frequency band of the 
communication apparatus. For example, when a radio 
communication apparatus has a usable frequency band from 900 
MHz to 920 MHz, if the frequency range for each person, 
i.e., each communication, is 100 KHz, two hundreds and one 
radio communications are possible. Figure 18 illustrates input frequency vs. output 
voltage characteristics of the filter 13 of the radio 
transmitter 800 shown in figure 17. The usable frequency 
band of this radio transmitter ranges from 900 MHz to 920 
MHz. As shown in figure 18, the filter 13 has a pass band 
for suppressing signals of
