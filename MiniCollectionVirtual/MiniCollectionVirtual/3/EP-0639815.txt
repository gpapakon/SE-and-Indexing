<ABSTRACT>
A method for constrained material requirements planning, 
optimal resource allocation, and production planning provides 

for an optimization of a manufacturing process by designating 
the amounts of various manufactured products to be produced, 

which products include both end products as well as 
subassemblies to be employed in the manufacture of one or more 

of the end products. In order to accomplish the optimization, 
the method employs an objective function such as the 

maximization of income in a situation wherein there are 
limitations on the inventory of raw materials and tools to be 

employed in the manufacturing process. Data describing 
elemental steps in the manufacturing process for the 

production of each end product, as well as the quantity or 
demand for each end product which is to be supplied, are 

presented as a set of linear mathematical relationships in 
matrix form to be inserted in a computer which determines the 

optimum number of each end product in accordance with an LP 
optimization algorithm. The matrix contains bill of material 

data, and various constraints such as a constraint on the sum 
of products shipped and used as subassemblies, and constraints 

based on inventory, on available time for use of resources 
such as tools, and on inventory left over from an early 

production run for a later run.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methodology for optimization of 
manufacturing resource planning (MRP), including resource 
allocation and production planning, by linear programming and, 
more particularly, to optimization of MRP for a multiple level 
assembly process by use of an optimal resource allocation 
procedure to determine shipment and production schedules, 
these schedules to be included in data of the MRP process. A need for resource allocation decisions arises in a broad 
range of technological and industrial areas such as the 
assignment of transmission facilities in telephone 
transmission systems, the control of the product mix of a 
factory, the deployment of industrial equipment, and inventory 
control, by way of example. Resource allocation in this 
context means, in general, the deployment of specific 
technological or industrial resource for the production of 
particular technological or industrial results. Resource allocation decisions are typically subject to 
constraints such as limitations in availability of materials, 
equipment, time, cost, and other parameters affecting the 
outcome of a technological process, as well as the utility of 
a particular resource in a particular application. As an 
example of particular interest herein, there is need to 
optimize the MRP for production of products, such as 
semiconductor devices, particularly in a situation wherein 
plural intermediate products must be formed first during 
various time frames for subsequent combination to provide the 
end product. Each particular allocation of resources can be 
associated with a specific result such as the cost or number 
of products produced.  Ideally, resources should be allocated so as to satisfy all of 
the constraints and, simultaneously, to maximize a resulting 
benefit, such as by minimizing the costs or by maximizing the 
number of devices outputted by a manufacturing process. One method of representing such allocation decision problems 
is known as a linear programming model. Such a model consists 
of a number of linear relationships, set forth in matrix 
format, and representing quantitatively the relationships 
among allocations, constraints and results of an industrial or 
other technological process. In the linear relationships, 
there is provided the sum of constant coefficients multiplied 
by unknown allocation values. While many resource 
allocation problems are not represented by such linear 
relationships, but involve higher powers or other nonlinear 
expression of equation variables,
