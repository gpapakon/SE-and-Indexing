<ABSTRACT>
A process of preparing a treated labdanum oil is 
disclosed, which comprises: (a) a step of mixing a labdanum 

raw material with an aqueous alkali solution and separating 
the aqueous layer; (b) a step of adding an acidic substance 

to the aqueous layer separated in step (a) and separating the 
thus released acidic components of labdanum; and (c) a step 

of heating the acidic components obtained in step (b) at a 
temperature of from 200 to 350°C for a period of from 0.1 to 

10 hours. A treated labdanum oil prepared in this process 
and a perfume composition containing the same are also 

disclosed. A novel ketone compound of formula (I): 

and a perfume composition containing the ketone compound are 
further disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a treated labdanum oil with
an improved odor which is useful as a material of a perfume
composition and a process for preparing the same. It also
relates to a novel ketone compound having an animal and
amber-like fragrance and a perfume composition containing the
same.Labdanum is a black and highly viscous liquid
obtained from plants belonging to the genus Cistus.
Labdanum, though of plant origin, has an animal and amber-like
fragrance and is widely used as a natural amber material
in various perfume compositions (see S. Arctander, Perfume
and Flavor Chemicals and Osamu Okuda, KORYO KAGAKU SORAN).
Labdanum in general use includes labdanum gum obtained by
boiling branches and leaves of Cistus Ladaniferus L. in water
and then collecting a resin separated therefrom, labdanum gum
extract obtained by removing inorganic solids from the
labdanum gum, and labdanum gum distillate obtained by
distillation or fractional distillation of the labdanum gum
extract.However, these conventional labdanum gum, labdanum
gum extract and labdanum gum distillate not only give off an 
undesired crude woody note like cedarwood oil as well as an
amber-like fragrance but assume a black to brown black color.
Therefore, where the labdanum product is used as such as a
material of perfume compositions for soaps, detergents, etc.
to give its characteristic amber animal fragrance, it
deteriorates the smell of the scented products due to its
rough, woody odor and also colors the products.While considerable study has been given to the
fragrance components present in labdanum, the animal and
amber-like fragrance characteristic component of labdanum has
not yet been elucidated.An object of the present invention is to provide a
treated labdanum oil which is free from the crude odor like
cedarwood oil possessed by the conventional labdanum gum,
labdanum gum extract and labdanum gum distillate, which has
an animal and amber-like fragrance with an enhanced animal
note, and which has a reduced color and a reduced viscosity.Another object of the present invention is to provide
a process for preparing the above-mentioned treated labdanum
oil.A further object of the present invention is to
provide a perfume composition containing the above-mentioned
treated labdanum oil.A still further object of the present invention is to
provide a novel perfume component, in particular, a compound 
having an animal and ambler-like fragrance and useful as a
material for perfume compounding.The present inventors have conducted extensive
inv
