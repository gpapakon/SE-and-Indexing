<ABSTRACT>
A position determination device (15) operating on an ultrasonic basis on a linear actuator (1) is proposed. The drive element (4) of the linear actuator carries a magnetic arrangement (27) which operates in conjunction with an adjacently arranged sensor device (16) which contains a sound wave conductor of magnetostrictive material. The magnetic arrangement (27) has an axially polarised ring- or disc-shaped magnetic part (33) and a pole part (34) arranged next to the former. The variation of the magnetic field of the magnetic part (33) can be influenced via the design of the pole part (34) in order to provide for optimum tuning with respect to the sensor device (16).

A position sensing device (15) operating on an ultrasonic
basis on a linear drive (1), for detecting the axial position of

an axially-movable drive element (4) mounted in the casing (2)
of a linear drive (1), with a sensor device (16) attached firmly

to the casing in the radial peripheral area of the drive element
(4) and having an acoustic waveguide (18) of material suitable

for magnetostriction extending in the longitudinal direction of
the casing (2) and communicating with an analysis unit (26), and

with a magnet assembly (27) containing permanent magnets and
linked to the drive element (4) within the casing (2) in such a

way that its magnetic field (32) acts on the momentarily radially
adjacent area of the acoustic waveguide (18), characterized in

that one permanent magnet of the magnet assembly (27) is in the
form of an axially-polarized, annular or disc-shaped magnet

element (33), so linked to the drive element (4) that its two
pole surfaces (35, 36) are axially aligned, and that the magnet

assembly (27) also encompasses an annular or disc-shaped pole
element (34) located coaxially alongside one of the pole surfaces

(35) of the magnet element (33).
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that a pole
element (34) of the magnet assembly (27) is flanked coaxially on

either side by an axially-polarized annular or disc-shaped
permanently-magnetic magnet element (33, 33'), with the two

magnet elements (33, 33') being so arranged that their pole
surfaces face one another with like polarity.
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the
pole element (34) is located on the side of the north pole

surface (35) of each magnet element (33, 33'). 
Device according to any of claims 1 to 3, characterized in
that the magnet assembly (27) is at least partly embedded in the

drive element (4).
Device according to claim 4, characterized in that the magnet
assembly (27) is completely encompassed by the drive element (4).
Device according to claim 5, characterized in that the drive
element (4) has two axially-consecutive elements (38) bounding

a mounting space (39) which accommodates the magnet assembly
(27).
Device according to any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in
that the annular or disc-shaped elements (33, 33', 34) of t
he
magnet assembly (27) are directly adjacent to one another.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in
that the linear drive (1) is an operating cylinder, and the drive

element (4) is its piston.
Device according to any of claims 1 to 8, characterized in
that sensor device (16) located on the long side next to the

casing area (3) accommodating the drive element (4) is mounted
in a channel-like recess (46) integral with the wall (47) of the

casing (2) of the linear drive (1) and running parallel to the
longitudinal axis (14) of the casing.
Device according to claim 9, characterized in that the casing
(3) is in the form of an extruded section, preferably of

aluminium.
Device according to claim 9 or 10, characterized in that the
channel-like recess (46) is open at one or more end faces to form

an insertion opening (48) for the sensor device (16). 
Device according to any of claims 9 to 11, characterized in
that the analysis unit (26) is accommodated in a protected space

(52) axially adjoining the channel-like recess (46).
Device according to claim 12, characterized in that the
protected space (52) is located at least partially in a

protective enclosure (53) attached axially to the casing (2) of
the linear drive (1).
