<ABSTRACT>
A frictionless hinge arrangement comprises two hinge components (1,2), 
each 

having a hinge surface (3,4), the hinge surfaces (3,4) 
confronting each other, and 

connected hingedly close together by a plurality of thin pliable 
connecting straps (11,12), of which each such strap passes between the 

confronting surfaces (3,4) 
of the two hinge components (1,2), thus very slightly 

separating them; the straps (3,4) being disposed in approximately s-shape 
and reverse s-shape arrangement alternately in one sense and in the 

other to allow the adjacent hinge surfaces (3,4) 
to roll on each other (with 

the straps (11,12) in between) 
when the hinge is opened or closed, each strap 

being secured fixed on each side in relation to a respective one of 
the hinge components; wherein on each side, each of the flexible 

straps (11,12) is provided with a lug (13,14) 
accommodated in a slot or socket 

formation (9,10) 
associated with one of the hinge parts (thus fixing the lug 

in relation to one of the hinge parts), so that the slot or socket 
formation (9,10) 

retains the lug (13,14) and the associated end of the strap against 
movement lengthwise relative to the hinge parts (1,2) as well as against 

disassembly by any pulling-forces exerted on the flexible strap (11,12). 
The 

end of the flexible strap that forms part of the snap-in fixing can be 
accessible by a user's hand or by a tool to allow the complementary 

formations to be dislodged and thereby disassembled. The hinges (and 
kits of parts for making them) are applicable for example to fold-up 

displays, space frames, constructional display systems, folding or 
other hinged doors and partitions for office furniture, dividers, 

doors and gates, as well as almost any other application requiring 
hinge function. In such hinge arrangements the ends of the flexible 

straps can be provided with springy folded-back tongue extensions to 
help retain the lugs in engagement with the socket formations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to hinge arrangements and to their construction 
and their applications, for example to their use for panel assemblies, 
for display devices with plural relatively fixed or movable panels or 
other parts, and for hinged doors. In particular the invention 
concerns frictionless hinge arrangements, their construction and 
assembly, and their applications, and kits of parts for assembly to 
form such hinge arrangements. The prior art includes a number of frictionless hinge arrangements. 
Frictionless hinges are known prior art of a general type appearing to 
have in common the following general features. In such frictionless 
hinges, there are generally two hinge parts or hinge components with 
confronting surfaces to be connected hingedly together, for example 
after the manner of an edge of a door and a side of its doorframe. 
These hinge components have rounded (alternatively, nearly flat) hinge 
surfaces that confront each other. The hinge components are connected 
by a plurality of thin pliable connecting straps which can be in the 
form of flat bands or thin wires. Each such strap passes between the 
rounded (or nearly rectangular) confronting surfaces of the two hinge 
components, thus very slightly separating them; each such strap is 
disposed in approximately an s-shape (or reverse s-shape) arrangement 
which at or near one of its ends passes against a front edge of one 
hinge component, thence between the confronting surfaces of the hinge 
components, and thence at or near the other of its ends against a back 
edge of the other hinge component. One end of each strap is secured 
fixed in relation to each hinge component. Adjacent connecting straps 
pass alternately against the front and the back of each of the hinge 
components, so that as seen from one end of the hinge assembly, 
transverse to the hinge axis, the straps are disposed alternately in 
s-shape and in reverse s-shape. This is otherwise expressed by saying 
that the straps are passed round the hinge components alternately in 
one sense and in the other to allow the adjacent hinge surfaces to  
 
roll on each other (with the straps in between) when the hinge is 
operated (e.g. opened or closed). German Patent 38 870 (Schmidt, 1886) describes hinge arrangements for 
hanging doors on their frames, using rounded-off edges of the door and 
its frame or post, and flexible metal strips attached one under 
another to the door and the frame in such a way that adjacent strips 
cross. French Patent 1 030 268 (Willm, 1950)

<CLAIMS>
1: A frictionless hinge arrangement comprising two hinge components 
(1,2), each having a hinge surface (3;4), said hinge surfaces 

confronting each other, and connected hingedly close together by a 
plurality of thin pliable connecting straps (11,12), of which each of 

said straps passes between said confronting surfaces of said hinge 
components, thus very slightly separating them; said straps being 

disposed in approximately s-shape and reverse s-shape arrangement 
alternately in one sense and in the other sense to allow said 

confronting hinge surfaces to roll on each other (with said straps 
therebetween) when the hinge arrangement is opened or closed, each 

said strap being secured fixed on each side in relation to a 
respective one of the hinge components; characterised in that at 

least one end of each said flexible strap (11;12) is provided with a 
formation (15;16) that cooperates with a complementary formation 

(17,18;19,20) which is fixed in relation to a respective one of said 
hinge components (1;2) so that the said formations together form a 

releasable snap-in fixing (15;16;17,18;19,20) that retains said end of 
said strap against movement lengthwise relative to said respective one 

of said hinge parts (1;2) as well as against disassembly by any 
pulling-forces exerted on said flexible strap (11;12). 
2: A hinge arrangement as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that 
the snap-in closure (15;16;17,18;19,20) is manually releasable. 
3: A hinge arrangement as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the end of the flexible strap that forms part of the snap-in 

fixing, is accessible (13;14;29;30) by a user's hand or by a tool to 
allow the complementary formations (15;16;17,18;19,20) to be dislodged 

and thereby disassembled. 
4: A hinge arrangement as claimed in claim 1, 2, or 3, characterised 
in that said releasable snap-in fixing comprises a lug (15;16) 

associated with a respective end of a respective flexible strap 
(11;12) for accommodation in a slot or socket formation 

(23,24;17,18,19,20) associated with one of said hinge parts (1,2), 
thereby to retain said lug in relation to one of said hinge parts. 
5: A hinge arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1-4, characterised 
in that said lug comprises a pair of arms (15;16) each extending 

transversely of the length direction of said flexible strap, and said 
slot or socket formation (23,24) comprises a pair of lands 

(17,18;19,20) which are spaced apart by about the width of the 
flexible strap (11;12) and further comprises a socket space behind the 

lands, arranged to receive the end of the flexible strap (11;12) and 
its lug (15;16), together with a wider opening away from the 

confronting surfaces of the hinge part arranged so that the end 
(25;26) of the flexible strap together with its lug (15;16) can be 

inserted through the wider opening and brought into the socket space 
to engage with the lands (17,18;19,20) and so to be retained by the 

lands against pulling-forces that would tend to disassemble the strap 
from the hinge bodies. 
6: A hinge arrangement as claimed in any of claims 1-5, characterised 
in that the ends (25,26) of the flexible straps are provided with 

springy folded-back tongue extensions (25,26) to help retain the lugs 
(15,16) in engagement with said lands (17,18;19,20) of the socket 

formations. 
7. A display arrangement characterised in that it includes a 
frictionless hinge arrangement according to any of claims 1-6, 

comprising a first hinge part (#8: 4a,5a) in fixed relation with a 
first panel (#8: 4,5) or edge member for mounting a panel, and a 

second hinge part in fixed relation with a second panel or edge member 
for mounting a panel. 
8. A display arrangement according to claim 7, characterised in that 
each said hinge part (#1: 1,2) has open ends with circular or 

part-circular cross hollow section to allow insertion therein of a 
cylindrical connecting rod thereby to allow assembly of plural numbers 

of hinges or hinged panels (#7,#8: 1,2; 4,6; 8,9) together with any 
desired rotational angle between the planes of adjacent panels.
