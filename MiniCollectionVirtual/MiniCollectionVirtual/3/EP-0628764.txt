<ABSTRACT>
A switch assembly, particularly for use in a flashlight, is provided which is 
moveable about a longitudinal axis of a flashlight between at least a first position for 

placing the light source in electrical continuity with the power source and a second 
position breaking the electrical continuity between the light source and the power 

source. The switch assembly is connected to the flashlight in a removable and 
aesthetically pleasing manner and, during operation, wiping of contact strips ensures 

continual prevention of corrosion build-up.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrical switch assembly, particularly to an
electrical switch assembly for use in a flashlight.In general, flashlights and portable lanterns include a protective body which
contains one or more batteries electrically connected, either in a series or in parallel, by
a conductor to a light source. The conductor is typically interrupted by a switch
mechanism which moves the light source into contact with the conductors. There are
three well-known switching mechanisms which are used in this way, that is a push
button switch, a slide, or a twisting head.Although such switching mechanisms are commonly used on many articles,
including flashlights, there are disadvantages associated with their use. Thus, in the
push button and slide switches the aesthetic incorporation of the switch within the
design of the flashlight often causes problems. A further problem associated with the
push button switch is the occasional failure of the spring mechanism used to rebound
the switch between the on/off positions. In addition, there is often a loss of electrical
continuity and, as a result, failure of the article to operate, associates with the use of a
push button switch, caused by a general lack of a wiping action to clear contact points
or to prevent corrosion build-up.A disadvantage associated with the twisting head switch, that is a switch in
which the head is twisted into contact with the conductors, is that the operator often
does not know which way to rotate the head in order to turn the flashlight on. This is a
particular problem when there is a focus adjustment feature incorporated into the head
of the flashlight, which requires that the head assembly be rotated through various
positions in order to adjust the focus. In that case there is inevitable confusion between
twisting to activate the light and twisting to adjust the focus of the light. The ideal action
for such an embodiment would be for the switch to be off when the head or lens
housing is in its forward-most position. Some rotation, and resulting rearward
longitudinal motion, would be required to make contact and activate the light source.
Contact could then be maintained during subsequent rotation and resulting longitudinal
motion rearward as the focus is adjusted. The problem that occurs with this method is
that the head must always be returned to its forward-most position to deactivate the
light. Inevitably, this means that the specific focal position achieved during previous use 
of the light is lost when the
