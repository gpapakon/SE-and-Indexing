<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a 
household apparatus (1) for drying linen, characterized 

in that said apparatus comprises a flat body (2) 
including therein at least a fan (3,4) providing an air 

flow through a vertical grid (10). 
In front of the grid there is arranged a 
linen spreading panel (20) including a plurality of linen 

supporting wires or rods (21) which extend with a 
parallel relationship with respect to the air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
household apparatus for drying linen. As known, a very important problem in a 
household environment, mainly in cold months, is that 
of easily and quickly drying linen which operation, 
in winter time, usually requires a comparatively long 
time. In the industrial field, this problem has 
been already solved by using apparatus involving a 
very high power consume, for providing a high heat 
amount for drying in a short time the linen; however, 
such an apparatus can not be used in a household 
environment, since it involves, as stated, a very 
high power consume. Accordingly, the aim of the present 
invention is to solve the above mentioned problem, by 
providing a household apparatus for drying linen 
which is specifically designed for drying linen in a 
very short time without requiring a high power 
consume. Within the scope of the above mentioned 
aim, a main object of the present invention is to  
 
provide such a household linen drying apparatus which 
has a very reduced size, so as to be easily put 
against a wall without projecting substantially 
therefrom. Another object of the present invention is 
to provide such a linen drying apparatus which can be 
easily used jointly with conventional domestic linen 
spreading devices and which is adapted to provide a 
forced air circulation for drastically reducing the 
linen drying time and which, moreover, is very 
reliable and safe in operation as well as very 
competitive from a mere economic standpoint. According to one aspect of the present 
invention, the above mentioned aim and objects, as 
well as yet other objects, which will become more 
apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a household 
apparatus for drying linen, characterized in that 
said apparatus comprises a flat body including at 
least a fan for providing an air flow through a 
vertical grid assembly, in front of which can be 
arranged a linen spreading device including a 
plurality of linen supporting wires or rods arranged 
with a parallel relationship with respect to the air 
flow.  Further characteristics and advantages of 
the invention will become more apparent hereinafter 
from the following detailed disclosure of a household 
linen drying apparatus, which is illustrated, by way 
of an indicative, but not limitative, example, in the 
accompanying drawings, where: 
Figure 1 is a schematic perspective view of 
the apparatus shown in its use condition; Figure 2 illustrates another perspective 
view of the subject apparatus, shown in its closed
