<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to bracing of the central support of a composite column having spaced-apart supports extending at least partially parallel to said central support, in particular for composite columns of a bar-like grid framework, in the case of which the invention provides a central-support holder 6 which encloses the central support 3 at least partially in a positively locking and/or frictionally locking manner and from which a plurality of web portions 7 extend radially, each of said web portions 7 exhibiting a holder 8. The holders 8 each enclose one of the supports 4 at least partially in a positively locking and/or frictionally locking manner.   An increase in stability is achieved by the central-support holder according to the invention. It is only after the composite column has been set up that the central-support holder is fitted in a predetermined or desired axial position, the axial position being fixed both in accordance with visual standpoints and taking account of static standpoints. The axial fitting location of the central-support holder can be changed subsequently. This permits adaptation both to newly arising visual/architectural requirements and to changed strength conditions.
