<ABSTRACT>
A photo-to-photo transducer (12a) is composed by 
laminating a photoconductive layer member (16) and a 

photo-modulation layer member (20a) including liquid 
crystals of scattering type each other and disposing the 

members (16 and 20a) between two transparent electrodes 
(14 and 22). The transducer (12a) is operated as 

follows: a specified voltage is applied across the 
electrodes (14 and 22) to operate the photo-modulation 

layer member (20a) in the vicinity of operation threshold 

level thereof; an electro-magnetic radiation beam for 
writing information is projected onto the photoconductive 

layer member (16) through the electrode (14) at the side 
thereof; and an electro-magnetic radiation beam for 

reading the information is projected onto the photo-modulation 
layer member (20a) through the electrode (22) 

at the side thereof, thus the electro-magnetic radiation 
beam for reading the information is modulated accordingly 

with intensity of the electro-magnetic radiation beam for 
writing the information.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photo-to-photo
transducer (abbreviated to a PPC hereinafter) which
transduces information carried by an electro-magnetic
radiation beam such as light into some form applicable
to an image pick-up apparatus, an optical projector or
an optical computer. This invention also relates to an
image pick-up apparatus comprising a PPC.A video signal obtained by picking up an
optical image of an object can be easily processed by
such as editing, trimming and the like. Recording,
reproducing and erasing the video signal also can be
easily performed. These techniques have been widely
used in various fields such as printing, electronic
publishing, measuring and the like.There has been an increased demand for an
apparatus capable of imaging and recording an optical
information such as a moving picture or an image with a
higher resolution when compared to a conventional
apparatus.In order to reproduce images with high quality
and resolution, it is necessary for an image pick-up
apparatus to generate a video signal by which an image
of high quality and resolution can be reproduced.
However, an image pick-up apparatus using an image pick-up
tube has a limit for minimizing the diameter of an
electron beam, and also the target capacity thereof
increases as its size becomes large, resulting in a poor
resolution.Furthermore, for high resolution moving
images, the frequency band of a video signal becomes
larger than several tens to hundreds MHz, thus posing a
problem of poor S/N. The above problems have made it
difficult to obtain video signal which can reproduce
images of high quality and resolution.As for a PPC capable of receiving an optical
image of an object and emitting out the optical image
applicable to optical parallel processing in an optical 
projector and an optical computer and image-recording,
for example a space-modulation device such as a liquid
crystal-type optical modulator, a photoconductive-Pockels
effect-device and a microchannel-type optical modulator
or a device made of a photochromic material have been
remarked on.The assignee of this application has proposed an
image pickup apparatus with high resolution employing the
PPC which is shown in Fig. 1.Throughout the drawings, like reference numerals and
letters are used to designate like or equivalent elements
for the sake of simplicity of explanation.The image pickup apparatus shown in Fig. 1 comprises
an imaging lens 10, a PPC 12, a beam splitter 24, a wave-plate
26, an analyzer 28, a polarizer 30 and a light
source 32 such as
