<ABSTRACT>
An electronic control device, in particular for controlling or regulating the ignition or fuel injection of internal combustion engines, in which sensor output signals are read in at fixed read-in periods and individual components are derived from these at fixed calculation periods, which individual components are logically combined at output periods (180 DEG CA in four-cylinder engines) to form control or regulation variables (ignition angle, injection period). The length of the respective read-in period is fixed here as a function of the maximum speed of change of the associated sensor output signal in multiples of the output period, the same applying to the variable of the respective calculation period. As a result, processing time is saved, improving the speed of the calculation of the control variables or regulation variables. This is particularly advantageous in the high speed range.

Method for forming a control variable (ZW, ED), 
to be output periodically by a control unit (ST) in 

output periods (AP), for controlling a device, in particular 
the ignition or fuel injection of internal combustion 

engines, in which method output signals (a-e, g) of 
at least two sensors (A,B,D,E;G) are read into the 

control unit and, taking this as the basis, individual 
components (zw1-zw5) of the control variable (ZW, ED) are 

determined, characterized 

in that the reading in of the sensor output signals (a-e; 
g) and the determination of the individual components 

(zw1-zw5) takes place periodically at intervals of a 
reading-in period (EP) or a determination period (KP) 

which is identical to the output period (AP) of the 
control variable (ZW, ED) or is a multiple thereof, 
in that the reading-in period (EP) of a sensor output 
signal (a-e; g) is dependent on the rate of change of 

this signal, the reading-in period (EP) being greater the 
smaller the maximum rate of change of this signal, 
in that the determination period (KP) of each individual 
component (zw1-zw5) is dependent on the reading-in 

periods (EP) of the sensor output signals (a-e; g) 
involved in each individual component, and 
in that the control variable (ZW, ED) in each output 
period (AP) is formed from all the individual components 

(zw1-zw5) with the values which are valid in this output 
period. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the magnitude of the reading-in periods (EP) of the 

sensor output signals (a-e; g) and that of the determination 
periods (KP) of the individual components (zw1-zw5) 

can be varied as a function of an operating 
parameter of the device to be controlled. 
Method according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that one operati
ng parameter of the device to be controlled 
is the engine speed.
