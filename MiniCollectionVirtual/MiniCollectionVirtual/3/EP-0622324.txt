<ABSTRACT>
In order to simplify the change of a traversing device according to thread conditions, there is provided on a winding machine (1) an insertable traversing device (7) which guides the thread either by means of so-called grooved-drum traversing or a traversing device which guides the thread by means of so-called traversing flyers. The traversing device is arranged essentially opposite a contact roller, so that a thread (F) to be wound is guided to and fro according to a stroke length by the traversing device (7), by means of a thread guide (10), and is deposited onto a thread package (4) via the contact roller (5). The thread package (4) is wound onto a tube (3) which is drawn on a bobbin mandrel (2) or (2.1). Furthermore, as is evident from Figure 2, the traversing unit (14 or 14.1) can consist of upper and lower flyers, the upper flyers being stationary in an overall baseplate (49), whilst the lower flyers are mounted rotatably in unit baseplates (50), and, as is evident from Figure 3, the unit baseplates (50) are pivotable about an axis of rotation (51), in such a way that the lower flyers can be pivoted out of an operating position according to Figure 2 into a position of rest according to Figure 3, so that the lower flyers can thereby be exchanged quickly and simply.

A yarn traversing device with wings (7) for
guiding back and forth a yarn along a chuck in a

winding machine in order to form a bobbin thereon,

characterized in that the one wings (15, 17, 18,

21; 37, 38, 41, 42) are assigned to the one base
plate (49) and the other opposite wings (16, 19,

20, 22; 39, 40, 43, 44) are assigned to the other
base plate (50, 50.1, 50.2) and that the one base

position which is distanced from the other base

plate (49).
A traversing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that the traversing device for a

multifilament winding per chuck (2, 3) is respectively
provided with several traversing units

(14).
A traversing device as claimed in claim 2,

the connection of the wings to the common drive.
A traversing device as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the wings of a traversing device

which the same accepts the yarn and in the
following position in which the wings transfers

the yarn encompasses an angle α of substantially
45°.
A traversing device as claimed in claim 1,
characterized in that in a wings traversing unit

at least two wings pairs with substantially
oppositely arranged wings are provided per stroke

(H.1; H.2), with the rotational axes of the pair
of wings effecting the reversal of the stroke of

the yarn being arranged mutually offset in such a
way that the receiving wings projects further

towards the yarn and further in the direction of

A traversing device as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that upper outer wings (15, 21; 37, 42)
