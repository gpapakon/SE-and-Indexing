<ABSTRACT>
A cartridge adaptor for accommodating a 
second cartridge which is smaller than a first cartridge 

to allow the second cartridge to be mounted in a 
disk apparatus designed to receive the first cartridge. 

The cartridge adaptor includes a shutter opener engageable 
with a shutter opener of the disk apparatus to 

open and close a shutter of the second cartridge, a 
projection engageable with a recess of the second 

cartridge to restrict insertion direction of the second 
cartridge into the disk apparatus, and a conveying 

member which is be inserted into a transmission aperture 
formed in correspondence with an identification 

hole formed in the second cartridge, thereby opening 
and closing a detection hole of the cartridge adaptor 

formed at a corresponding position to an identification 
hole of the first cartridge. When the cartridge adaptor 

accommodating the second cartridge is mounted in 
the disk apparatus, the shutter of the second cartridge 

is opened, and the information on a disk housed in the 
second cartridge provided by the identification hole is 

correctly detected by the disk apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a cartridge
adaptor mountable in a disk apparatus for reproducing
or recording and reproducing a disk accommodated in a
cartridge, and also to a cartridge to be accommodated
in the cartridge adaptor.Along with recent improvement in the recording
density of disk-shaped recording mediums such as
optical disks, the resistance of such recording mediums
against dust and scratches has been lowered. For the
purpose of protection of the surfaces, such recording
mediums are accommodated in a cartridge formed of a
plastic material or the like.A cartridge includes a case having an opening
for accommodating a disk, a shutter for opening and
closing the opening, and the like. Through the opening,
a disk driving mechanism and a recording and
reproducing head is inserted into the cartridge.Today, optical disks are available in sizes
of 3.5 inches and 5.25 inches in the field of data
processing. In the audio and video field, the optical
disks are available from a minimum size of 2.5 inches
to a maximum size of 12 inches. Different cartridges
for reproducing or recording and reproducing apparatuses
are designed to receive different sizes of optical
disks. Demand for recording data in and reproducing
data from different sizes of disks using one disk
apparatus has been increased. Different sizes of
disks, which are accommodated in different sizes of
cartridges, can hardly be mounted directly in one disk
apparatus. In order to mount a cartridge which is
smaller than a cartridge which the disk apparatus is
designed to receive, the smaller cartridge is first
accommodated in a cartridge adaptor and then the cartridge
adaptor is mounted in the disk apparatus.
Examples of such a cartridge adaptor are disclosed in
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication Nos. 2-121174 and
2-187973.A conventional cartridge to be accommodated
in a cartridge adaptor mainly includes a cartridge case
having a head opening, a shutter for opening and closing
the head opening, and an optical disk rotatably
accommodated in the cartridge case. A surface of the
cartridge case has a write protect tab for prohibiting
erroneous deletion of data. The shutter is constantly
elastically biased to close the head opening by a
spring member built in the cartridge case.A conventional cartridge adaptor mainly
includes a case having a cartridge receptacle portion
and a head opening and a shutter for opening and closing
the head opening. In the case, an arm for opening
and closing the shutter of the cartridge is pivotably
supported. The arm

<CLAIMS>
A combination of a cartridge adaptor (130) mountable in a disk apparatus
designed to perform at least one of data reproduction from and data recording on

a disk accommodated in a first cartridge provided with an identifier for providing
information indicating one of a characteristic of the first cartridge and a

characteristic of the disk accommodated in the first cartridge, and a second cartridge
(3) to be accommodated in the cartridge adaptor (130), wherein:


the cartridge adaptor (130) includes a housing (1) for accommodating the
second cartridge (3), and the housing (1) has an external profile substantially

identical with the external profile of the first cartridge, an opening (4) for insertion
therethrough of at least a head for said at least one of recording and reproducing

and a disk driving mechanism of the disk apparatus, and an identification detection
section (15, 23) located at a position corresponding to the identifier of the first

cartridge; and
the second cartridge (3) is smaller in external profile than the first cartridge,
and includes:


an opening (25) for insertion therethrough of at least the head and the
disk driving mechanism,
an identifier of the second cartridge (3) for providing information
indicating a characteristic of the second cartridge (3), the identifier of the second

cartridge (3) including an identification hole (32) and indicating the information
based on whether the identification hole (32) is opened or closed, and
identification information conveying means (16, 16', 21) for
conveying the information provided by the identifier of the second cartridge (3) to

the identification detection section (15, 23) of the cartridge adaptor (130), the 
identification information conveying means (16, 16', 21) being configured to convey

the information provided by the identifier
