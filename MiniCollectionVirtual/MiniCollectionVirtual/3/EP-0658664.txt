<ABSTRACT>
Flat roof comprising a roof construction (1), on at 
least one edge thereof an eave profile (2) connected 

thereto and a roof covering foil (3) which is applied to 
the roof construction (1) and with its edge on at least 

part of the eave profile (2), characterized in that the 
eave profile (2) is composed of two profiles in between 

which an edge of the roof covering foil (3) is caught, 
namely a lower profile (6) which is connected to the 

roof construction (1) and an upper profile (7) which is 
located with one part (16, 17) over the lower profile 

(6) and the edge of the roof covering foil (3) and with 
an other part (21) is clenched over a part (15) of the 

lower profile (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a flat roof which contains a 
roof construction, on at least one edge thereof an eave 
profile attached thereto and a roof covering foil which 
is applied on the roof construction and with its edge on 
at least a part of the eave profile. With flat roofs of this type, the eave profile is 
simple. When the roof covering foil is not applied 
properly on the part of the eave profile, or comes 
loose, water can intrude under the roof covering foil. The invention aims at remedying this disadvantage and to 
provide in a flat roof with eave profile whereby the 
intrusion of water at the edge of the eave profile is 
excluded. This aim is met according to the invention because the 
eave profile is composed of two profiles in between 
which an edge of the roof covering foil is caught, 
namely a lower profile which is attached to the roof 
construction and an upper profile which is located with 
one part over the lower profile and the edge of the roof 
covering foil, and with an other part is clenched over a 
part of the lower profile. Seams in the lower profile are covered by the roof 
covering foil, whereas the outmost edge of this foil 
itself is covered by the upper profile. This upper 
profile can be attached to the lower profile in a very 
rapid way without connection means of tools, by means of 
clenching.  Efficiently, the part of the upper profile which is 
clenched is a slantingly upwards directed edge, and the 
part of the lower profile over which said part is 
clenched, is a slantingly downwards directed edge. In a special embodiment of the invention, the lower 
profile comprises a flat part which is attached to the 
roof construction and an upwards sloping part, whereas 
the upper profile comprises an upwards sloping part 
which is located above the upwards sloping part of the 
lower profile, a bend and a downwards sloping part which 
extends upto next to the roof construction. Thereby, the lower profile preferably comprises, under 
the upwards sloping part, a corner part of which one leg 
is almost in a direct line with the flat part of this 
lower profile, and of which the other leg is directed 
downwards next to the roof construction, while the part 
of the lower profile on which the upper profile is 
clenched, stands on the latter leg. Efficiently, the upper side of the upwards sloping part 
of the lower profile and the lower side of the 
above-lying upwards sloping part of the upper profile 
are corrugated. The invention also relates to an eave profile which is 
destined
