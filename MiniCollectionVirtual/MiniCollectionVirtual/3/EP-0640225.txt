<ABSTRACT>
A process is provided for preparing concentrated dye-water compositions for spectrally sensitizing photographic emulsions in the absence of a solvant or surfactant which comprises adding a sensitizing dye having a solubility in water as low as about 0.005 weight percent to water or a water-polymer medium with agitation at a temperature of from about 20 DEG  to about 50  DEG C and continuing agitation for from about 30 minutes to about 5 hours.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for
preparing concentrated dye-water compositions for the
spectral sensitization of photographic emulsions.Dyes for spectrally sensitizing silver halide
emulsions are known to be substantially insoluble in
water for all practical purposes. Accordingly, such
dyes, as well as other photographic additives which are
capable of being adsorbed on the grain surfaces of silver
salts, have been added to photographic silver halide
emulsions in the form of solutions in suitable water
miscible solvents such as methyl alcohol or
dimethylformamide.However, spectrally sensitizing dyes are
difficult to dissolve in the usual solvents.
Consequently, large quantities of solvent are often
needed for satisfactory dissolution of such additives.
This presents a significant problem since the presence of
residual solvent generally causes diffusion and migration
of spectrally sensitizing dyes in the emulsion. Further,
even minute residues of solvent promote recrystallization
processes in the photographic layer which, in turn,
adversely affect not only the dyes and other additives
introduced using solvent but other additives in the
emulsion as well. Moreover, if residues of polar organic
solvents miscible with water remain in a silver halide
emulsion, particularly a silver-rich emulsion having a
high silver packing density, the residual solvent
considerably reduces the stability of the casting
emulsion which in turn causes a reduced stability during
processing including phase separation between hydrophilic 
and hydrophobic phases, agglomeration, and coalescence as
well as flocculation before casting.Additives which need not be held on the surface
of silver halide crystals by adsorption after their
introduction into a photographic emulsion have long been
incorporated into silver halide emulsions in the form of
dispersions. For that purpose, the additive is usually
dissolved in a suitable solvent, which is generally
immiscible with water, in the presence of an oil former
and wetting agent, and then emulsified into an aqueous
gelatin solution. The low boiling solvent generally used
for this purpose is subsequently removed from the
emulsion and the resulting dispersion is added to the
photographic silver halide emulsion.Unfortunately, the complete removal of the
solvent from the resulting dispersion is difficult to
achieve, even when low boiling solvents are employed, and
particularly when polar solvents are employed. Polar
solvents, in particular polar protic solvents, can be
removed from gelatin
