<ABSTRACT>
A composition useful in copying and printing is described. 
In one embodiment, the composition comprises a purified 

fraction of uintaite and a thermoplastic polymer. Preferably, 
the composition comprises a maltene-enriched fraction 

of uintaite derived by solvent extraction, a thermoplastic 
polymer and a colorant. In another embodiment, the present 

invention is an electrophotographic method comprising the 
steps of generating a latent electrostatic image; developing 

said latent image with a toner comprising a purified 
fraction of uintaite; and fixing said toner. The present 

invention is also a printing ink emulsion comprising a 
maltene-enriched fraction of uintaite.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to new compositions of matter which 
are particularly useful in electrophotographic copying and 
printing. More particularly, this invention relates to a 
composition comprising a purified fraction of uintaite 
derived by solvent extraction and having a substantially 
reduced asphaltene content, combined with a thermoplastic 
polymer or a colorant. These compositions are particularly 
useful in toners and inks. Electrophotographic copying is a process where an 
electrostatic latent image is produced by a strong light 
flash. A colored, finely-divided powder, a dry toner, is 
used to develop and transfer this latent image into a 
visible image, generally on standard, plain paper. See 
Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Ed. 
Vol. 8, 1978, pp. 794-826, which is incorporated herein by 
reference. See also "Pigment Blacks in Toners for 
Electrophotographic Copying Process", American Ink Maker, 
July 1987, pp. 18-20, which is incorporated herein by 
reference. Although there are a variety of machines with different 
toner requirements, some of the steps in electrophotography 
are common to almost all systems. The first step is 
electrostatic charging or sensitization of the semiconductor 
photoconductor layer through corona discharge. Then, a 
latent electrostatic image of the original item to be copied 
is generated on this photoreceptor surface by exposure to  
 
light. This latent image corresponds to the intensity of 
light and dark areas in the original. This electrostatic 
image is developed by contact with a toner having an 
opposite triboelectric charge. The toner particles are then 
transferred from the semiconductor layer to the image 
carrier, e.g., the paper. The image is finally fixed, 
generally by means of heat and/or pressure. Lastly, the 
photoreceptor is cleaned of toner and neutralized of any 
residual charge. A variety of materials have been used as toners in copiers. 
These are described in the Encyclopedia of Materials Science 
and Engineering Vol. 2, pp. 1503-1508, 1986, which is 
incorporated herein by reference. Typically, thermoplastic 
organic polymers are used along with a colorant and a charge 
agent. Copolymers of acrylates or methacrylates and 
styrenes are the primary thermoplastics used in most 
commercial toners. Charge agents include such diverse 
components as ammonium salts and dyes. The natural mineral 
uintaite has been used in toner compositions. Desirable toner properties include low cost, hardness, 
friability, hydrophobility,
