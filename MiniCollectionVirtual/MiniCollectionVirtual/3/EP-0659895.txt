<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine valve having a body, a head and a contact surface disposed on said head adapted to periodically enter into gas sealing engagement with a valve seat, said contact surface being formed in metal alloy comprising an iron base hard facing alloy 
exhibiting good wear properties, resistance to PbO corrosion, and 
oxidation resistance in a relatively low cost composition. The alloy used in the invention has competitive high 
performance as used for forming a contact surface of engine valves, 
and can save considerably the cost of the preparation of the facings 
of engine valves. In general, the alloy powder may be useful 
wherever a high performance alloy is required for use at high 
temperature and under corrosive conditions. This type of service is 
required, for example, of the valves and associated of parts such as 
valve faces and inserts, which are directly exposed to the high 
temperatures and the corrosive products of combustion of internal 
combustion engines. Generally, these parts of engines must withstand 
exposure to corrosive gases passing thereover at high temperature and 
at temperatures ranging from about 538 °C or higher, at different 
parts of the cycle. A conventionally used hard-facing alloy for exhaust valve facings 
are the Stellite alloy, which are cobalt-chromium facing alloys 
commonly used in applications where an unfaced austenitic stainless  
 
steel valve is otherwise subject to severe face wear and corrosion. 
The various Stellite alloys including Cobalt based alloy of 
STL ( Stellite ) #6 (refer to JIS; 1.2C- 1.0Si-30Cr-4W-Co:balance ), 
STL #32 ( 1.8C-1.0Si-22Ni-26Cr-12W-Co: balance) possess excellent high 
temperature wear resistance, resistance to PbO corrosion and oxidation 
resistance. However, the Stellite alloys are expensive materials due 
to their high content of expensive metals such as cobalt, nickel and 
tungsten. The basic Stellite composition is a non-ferrous alloy of 40 
to 80 % cobalt, 0 to 25 % tungsten, 20 to 35 % chromium and 0.75 to 
2.5 % carbon. On the other hand, generally iron based alloy is relatively 
uncostly, but not good at high temperature performances. Where iron based alloy has been used for preparation of the 
contact surface of engine valves by oxyacetylene welding process, the 
prepared contact surface will entail high possibility of defects found 
in the contact facings. U. S. Patent No. 4,122,817 discloses an engine valve having a 
contact surface of formed of an alloy which
