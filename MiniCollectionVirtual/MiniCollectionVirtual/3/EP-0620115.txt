<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for coating printing carriers in printing machines for applying water-based liquids of relatively high viscosity. The object of the invention is to develop an appropriate device for printing machines, which allows in-line processing of liquids of relatively high viscosity. The object is achieved in that a flexographic printing unit (6) is arranged upstream of a conventional varnishing unit (7).

<CLAIMS>
Device in a rotary printing press for multi-colour 
offset printing for coating material to be printed 

with at least two varnishing units, wherein each 
varnishing unit has an impression cylinder (8), a 

forme cylinder (10) and an applicator roller (11, 
14), and the varnishing unit arranged upstream 

corresponding to the sheet running direction is 
constructed as a flexo print unit (6), wherein the 

flexo print unit (6) consists of the following 
elements: 


a relief forme carrying forme cylinder (10.1) which 
is in contact with the impression cylinder (8.1), 

an applicator roller (11) with a raster structure, 
which is in contact with the forme cylinder (10.1) 

and a settable-on chamber doctor (12) which is 
connected with a feed pump for liquid feed and a 

suction pump for liquid return wherein directly or 
indirectly arranged after the flexo print unit (6) 

is a varnishing unit (7) and wherein in the 
varnishing unit (7) an applicator roller (14) is 

provided relative to which a metering roller (13) is 
arranged to form a common metering slot. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the flexo print unit (6) is arranged in an offset 

printing press between the printing units (1-5). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the flexo print unit (6) is arranged in an offset 

printing press prior to the printing units (1-5). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that 
the flexo print unit (6) is arranged in an offset 

printing press subsequent to the printing units (1-5).
