<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a motor having a rotor driven by a 
vibrator generating a vibration of rope skipping motion. 

The rotor has a friction portion which is in contact with 
the friction portion of the vibrator so as to be given the 

vibration of rope skipping motion by the friction portion 
of the vibrator, and a supporting portion which is 

provided at a position spaced apart from the friction 
portion and which is contact with a portion of the 

vibrator. Thus, the motor is constructed compactly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vibration driven motor.A vibration driven motor comprising the features of the
pre-characterizing clause of claim 1 is known from
JP-A-6214 1980.Such a motor, as shown in Figure 12 of the
accompanying drawings, comprises a vibrator comprising a vibration member
100 comprising a metallic round bar of horn-like shape
the outer diameter of whose base portion gradually
decreases toward the fore end portion, a circular
ring-like metallic keep member 101 having an outer
diameter equal to that of the large-diameter portion
of the vibration member 100, and two electrostrictive
element plates 102, 103 as electromechanical energy
conversion elements formed into a circular ring-like 
shape and disposed between the vibration member 100
and the keep member 101, the keep member 101 being
fixed to the vibration member 100 by a bolt 104,
the electrostrictive element plates 102 and 103
being urged against each other and held thereby.
The electrostrictive element plates 102 and 103
each have on one surface thereof two electrodes
differing in the direction of polarization from
each other and formed symmetrically divisionally
and have a common electrode on the other surface
thereof, and are disposed positionally
90Â° out of phase with each and with the divisional electrode side
as the front side. Between the electrostrictive
element plates 102 and 103, there is disposed an electrode
plate which is in contact with the
divisional electrodes of the rearward electrostrictive
element plate 103 and the common electrode
of the forward electrostrictive element plate 102,
and the divisional electrodes of the forward electrostrictive
element plate 102 are in contact with the
vibration member 100 and the common electrode of the
rearward electrostrictive element plate 103 is in
contact with an electrode plate 105.By AC voltages equal in both amplitude and
frequency being applied to the forward electrostrictive
element plate 102 and the rearward
electrostrictive element plate 103 with a phase 
difference in time therebetween, a vibration comprising
the combination of the vibration of the electrostrictive
element plate 102 and the vibration of the electrostrictive
element plate 103 is generated in the
vibration member to thereby cause the fore end of the
vibration member to effect circular motion.Figure 13 of the accompanying drawings shows
a motor using such a vibrator as a drive source.
The fore end of the vibrator is urged against the
surface of a disk 108, and the disk 108 is frictionally
driven by the
