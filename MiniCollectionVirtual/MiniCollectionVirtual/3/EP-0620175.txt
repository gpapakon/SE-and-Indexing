A device for detachably holding a winding core of a roll of 
tape on a spindle by means of a spring-loaded, manually 

operated change-over device, characterised 

in that the spindle (4) is axially rotatably arranged on a 
stationary bearing journal (5), 
the spindle (4) being provided with a hub (6) connected 
to a disc (7), 
in that a spring ring (9) having an axial clearance is 
arranged concentrically between the hub (6) and a 

shoulder (8) of the spindle (4), 
in that the spring ring (9) in the unloaded state has a 
greater outer diameter than an inner diameter (10) of the 

winding core (2), 
in that the spindle (4) has a smaller diameter (11) than the 
inner diameter (10) of the winding core (2), 
in that a first free end (12) of the spring ring (9) is movably 
connected to the spindle (4) and a second free end (13) 

of the spring ring (9) is movably connected to the hub (6), 
and in that the spindle (4) is provided with a free-running 
device (14), the bearing journal (5) being provided as a 

free-running shaft. 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that a 
Seeger ring (9A) having openings (15, 16) arranged within  

 
the outer diameter is provided as the spring ring (9), one 

opening (15) being connected to the spindle (4) by a pin 
(17) and the other opening (16) being connected to the hub 

(6) by another pin (18). 
A device according to at least one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the device (1) is provided for holding 

rolls (3) of one-sided adhesive tape. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that the device (1) is provided for 

apparatus for binding elongate objects (cable harnesses). 
A device according to at least claim 1, characterised in that 
the device (1) is interchangeably constructed for different 

winding-core diameters (10).
