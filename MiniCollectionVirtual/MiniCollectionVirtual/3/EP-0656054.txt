 SPECIFICATION ALIQUOT-PACKAGE DETERGENT PRODUCT USING WATER- SOLUBLE FILMBackground of the Invention Field of the InventionThe present invention relates to an aliquot- package detergent product, i.e., a dispenser, comprising an aliquot quantity of a detergent packaged in a water-soluble packaging film which exhibits a high strength, which is excellent in elasticity and is free from rigidification when used for packaging a detergent therein. The packaging film provides a pleasant touch to a user who uses the packaged detergent and the breaking strength thereof lowers only a small amount during storage of the packaged detergent. Description of the Related ArtMost of the conventional, commercially available powdered detergent products for clothes are those which comprise 100 to 200 cm3 by volume (an amount necessary for performing washing 60 to 100 times) of a detergent packaged in a paper carton which is prepared by spray drying, has a bulk density of 0.2 to 0.4 g/cm3, and is used normally in an amount of about 40 g 

per 30 _ of water in a unit run of washing. It has been common practice to use them either by lifting the carton itself and shaking an appropriate amount of the powdered detergent directly out of the carton into a washing machine tub or by roughly weighing a necessary amount of the detergent out of the carton with a cup or the like and throwing the weighed detergent into a washing machine tub. Recently, powdered detergents having a bulk density of 0.7 g/cm3 or above have been developed, whereby the problem of carrying a powdered detergent or the like has been solved. However, powdered detergents having a bulk density of 0.7 g/cm3 or above still have a handling problems in that the detergent powder scatters during the process of weighing or throwing.In order to solve the problem of detergent powder scattering when being weighed or thrown, one-pack detergent products prepared by packaging a detergent in an amount necessary for one washing run in a water- insoluble, water-permeable or water-soluble material have been proposed. For example, Japanese Patent Publication-A Nos. 8497/1988 (published on January 14, 1988) and 12467/1988 (published on January 19, 1988) disclose certain one-pack detergent products prepared by packaging a detergent in a water-soluble material 

such as a water-soluble film, specific examples of which include those prepared by packaging an aliquot quantity of a detergent having a bulk density as high as 0.5 to 1.2 g/cm3 in a water-soluble film and those prepared by
