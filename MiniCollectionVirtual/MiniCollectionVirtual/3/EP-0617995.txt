<ABSTRACT>
An activated-carbon solvent treatment unit (1) for 
dry-cleaning machines with increased absorption, which 

comprises a cylindrical container (2) with a vertical axis 
that extends vertically and has a convex hood (5) and base 

(10) connected respectively to a tube (13) for introducing 
the gaseous air-solvent mixture (A+S) arriving from the 

drum and to an intake fan (12) connected to a tube (11) for 
the discharge of the treated air (A); the container (2) is 

internally provided with two filtering diaphragms (14,15) 
between which activated carbon is arranged; a cooling heat 

exchanger (16) is arranged below the lower diaphragm (14) 
and is suitable, during absorption, to lower the 

temperature of the warm mixture arriving from the drum to 
cause the solvent to be absorbed by the activated carbon at 

the temperature at which the carbon is most effective, and, 
during regeneration, to cause the condensation of the 

water-solvent mixture to be sent to a separator.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an activated-carbon 
solvent treatment unit for dry-cleaning machines with 
increased absorption. In the past, at the end of the dry-cleaning cycle the 
door of the drum was opened and the garments were removed 
while they still contained considerable traces of solvent, 
most of which dispersed spontaneously in the environment; 
later, in order to work more effectively and to eliminate 
residual solvent traces from the cleaned garments, the so-called 
deodorization cycle has been devised: in practice, 
the washing drum is flushed by a stream of warm air which 
removes even small traces of solvent and moisture from the 
garments. Until recently, this stream used to be discharged 
outside either directly or through an activated-carbon 
filter in order to recover part of the solvent present in 
the expelled air. Now, instead, due to more restrictive pollution-control 
rules, a stream of air containing solvent can be 
discharged outside only if it complies with maximum 
concentration values determined on the basis of the flow-rate 
of the air stream. Known activated-carbon filters have some drawbacks 
related to the fact that often the shape, dimensions and 
orientation of the filter are not such as to produce 
effective air treatment: in addition to this, the activated 
carbon often works in non-optimum conditions, in that the  
 
temperature of the gaseous mixture conveyed onto the carbon 
is too high to allow the carbon to fully use its absorption 
ability, and this prevents the extraction of all the 
solvent that should be removed: one should bear in mind 
that the amounts of solvent that the statutory provisions 
of various countries allow to disperse into the 
environment, are constantly becoming smaller. Also known from DE-A-3 139 781 is a solvent treatment unit with 
vacuum regeneration The aim of the present invention is to obviate the 
above described drawbacks of known devices, i.e. to provide 
an activated-carbon solvent treatment unit for dry-cleaning 
machines with increased absorption which produces very high 
solvent absorption. Within the scope of this aim, another object of the 
present invention is to achieve the above aim with a 
structure which is simple, relatively easy to produce in 
practice, safe in use and effective in operation, as well 
as relatively modest in cost. This aim and these objects are all achieved by the 
present activated-carbon solvent treatment unit of claim 1.

<CLAIMS>
Activated-carbon solvent treatment unit (1) for 
dry-cleaning machines with increased absorption, 

comprising a cylindrical container 
(2) that extends vertically and has a base (10) with a 

tube (13) for introducing the gaseous air-solvent mixture 
(A+S) arriving from the drum of a dry-cleaning machine 

and with a convex hood (5) connected via a tube (11) 
to an intake fan (12) 

for the discharge of the treated 
air (A), a duct (17) connected to a steam supply and a water 

and solvent removal duct (19) are connected respectively to 
said hood (5) and to said base (10) of said container (2) 

for the activated-carbon regeneration step, said container (2) 
being internally provided with 

two filtering diaphragms (14,15) between which activated 
carbon is arranged, a cooling heat exchanger (16) which is 

arranged below the lower diaphragm (14) and is suitable, 
duri
ng absorption, to lower the temperature of the warm 
mixture (A+S) arriving from said drum to cause the solvent 

to be absorbed by the activated carbon at the temperature 
at which the carbon is most effective, and, during 

regeneration, to cause the condensation of the steam-solvent 
mixture to be sent to a water-solvent separator.  

 
Treatment unit according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said heat exchanger (16) is suitable to bring the 

air-solvent mixture (A+S) arriving from the drum to a 
temperature at the order of 20 degrees Celsius.
