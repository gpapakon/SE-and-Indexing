<ABSTRACT>
Improved elastomeric materials useful for medical and 
therapeutic device applications, such as penetrable septa, 

are described. In one aspect, the materials are deep-cleaned 
with solvent to significantly lower levels of 

undesirable organics. In another aspect, internally 
lubricated elastomer compositions compatible for use in 

medical and therapeutic device applications are provided. 
The lubricating fluid is present in the composition from 

about 0.5% to 50% by weight, and is initially substantially 
homogeneously dispersed in the elastomer. The fluid can be 

integrated into the elastomer by a solvent infusion method.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of elastomeric
materials suitable for use in biomedical applications. In
particular, the invention is related to penetrable
elastomeric materials for use as septa for injection or
withdrawal of fluids employing needle syringes or related
fluid withdrawal/injection devices.There is a continuing need in the medical device field
for inexpensive elastomeric materials that combine
biocompatibility with desirable elastomer properties such
as flexibility, durability, and tear-strength. In
particular, improved inexpensive biocompatible elastomer
materials for sealing and access applications are needed.The present invention provides means for treating
elastomeric material, particularly inexpensive natural and
synthetic rubbers, which significantly improves ease of use
while decreasing the amount of undesirable organics that
are extractable from the elastomer into physiological
fluids. The methods provided minimize deterioration of
desirable elastomeric properties of the material and
instead result in improvement of certain properties. The
methods provided are particularly useful for applications
to penetrable elastomeric materials including applications
of such materials in human infusion systems. One method
involves deep cleaning of elastomers employing organic
solvents. A second method involves introduction of
lubricating fluids into elastomers to give more easily
,penetrable materials. A third method involves infusion of
the elastomer with a solution of a lubricating fluid in an
organic solvent to give internally-lubricated elastomeric 
materials having significantly lower levels of extractable
organics.In view of the serious concerns today with reducing
health care worker contact with patient blood and other
body fluids, there have been increasing efforts in the
health care industry to improve the integrity of apparatus
for the infusion of or withdrawal of fluids from patients.
A needle-penetrable barrier functions as the most
convenient means for introducing or withdrawing fluids from
patient infusion systems. The penetrable barrier or septum
allows access to the infusion system while protecting the
patient from external contamination and protecting others
from contact with potentially dangerous patient body
fluids. It is desirable that such barriers allow
penetration for fluid access with minimum force of
insertion to lessen the danger of either damage to the
apparatus or injury to the patient while maintaining a
sealed system. Currently, infusion systems are single
patient,
