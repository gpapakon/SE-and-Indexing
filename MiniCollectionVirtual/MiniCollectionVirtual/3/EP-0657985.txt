<ABSTRACT>
System for supplying a load (M) with electrical energy from a main source (SP) and from an auxiliary source (UC) consisting of an energy storage and recovery device of the high mass energy capacitor type, in which the auxiliary source (UC) is connected directly to the terminals of the load (M), characterised in that a power electronics interface (IEP), of the switched-mode static converter type, is interposed between the main source (SP) and the auxiliary source (UC), this interface being continuously monitored on the basis of electrical quantities characterising the system status, so as to obtain smoothing of the power supplied by the main source (SP).

A system for supplying a load (M) with electric 
energy from a principal source (SP) and an auxiliary source 

(UC) formed by a capacitor-type energy storage and recovery 
device, wherein the auxiliary source (UC) is connected 

directly across the load (M), a power electronic interface 
(IEP) of the chopping st
atic converter type being 
interposed between the principal source (SP) and the 

auxiliary source (UC), said interface being permanently 
controlled from electric quantities characterizing the 

system status, so as to obtain the smoothing of the power 
supplied by the principal source (SP), characterized in 

that the power electronic interface (IEP) is controlled 
according to the value of the current at its output (I
IEP
) 
and to the value (V
UC
) of the voltage across the auxiliary 
source (UC), in accordance with a specific law comprising 

at least four phases, i.e.: 

1/ a first phase, during which the voltage (V
UC
) 
across the auxiliary source (UC) is constant and equal to a 

first predetermined value (V1), while the output current 
(I
IEP
) of the interface (IEP) varies between 0 and a first 
predetermined value (I1); 
2/ a second phase, during which the voltage (V
UC
) 
across the auxiliary source (UC) varies between said first 

predetermined value (V1) and a second predetermined value 
(V2), which is lower than said first predetermined value, 

while the output current (I
IEP
) of the interface (IEP) 
varies between said first predetermined value (I1) and a 

second predetermined value (I2), which is higher than said 
first predetermined value; 
3/ a third phase, during which the voltage (V
UC
) 
across the auxiliary source (UC) is constant and equal to 

said second predetermined value (V2), while the output  
 

current (I
IEP
) of the interface (IEP) varies between said 
second predetermined value (I2) and a maximum value (IM); 

and 
4/ a fourth phase, during which the output current 
(I
IEP
) of the interface (IEP) is limited to its maximum 
value (IM), while the voltage (V
UC
) across the auxiliary 
source (UC) becomes lower than said second predetermined 

value (V2). 
The system according to claim 1, characterized in 
that during the second phase the voltage (V
UC
) across the 
auxiliary source (UC) varies according to the output 

current (I
IEP
) of the interface (IEP) in accordance with a 
predetermined law. 
The system according to claim 2, characterized in 
that said predetermined law is a linear variation law. 
The system according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the principal source (SP) is current reversible, 

characterized in that there is provided a fifth phase, 
during which the voltage (V
UC
) across the auxiliary source 
(UC) having reached a maximum value (VM), the interface 

(IEP) is made current reversible so that energy can be 
returned to the principal source.
