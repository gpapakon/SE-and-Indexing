<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a modular wall chamber 
for sliding doors (2) comprising flanks (10) 

constituted by fretted metal panels (3) arranged 
in succession and interconnected by means of 

connecting joints (4) made on adjacent edges (51, 
52) of the panels (3). The edges (51, 52) are 

complementarily shaped so as to be associable by 
reciprocal superposing with a movement which is 

transversal to the lie plane (9) of the panels 
(3), thus connecting one to another by elastic 

snap-fitting and subsequent geometrical 
interference in a parallel direction to the lie 

plane (9) of the panels (3).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a modular chamber of the
type fitted into walls to receive a sliding door.
Such chambers comprise flanks constituted by metal
panels arranged in succession and interconnected
by means of joints made on adjacent edges of the
panels, the edges being shaped so as to form
geometrical joints effective according to a
direction of the panels which is parallel to their
lie plane.Before being installed in a space specially made
in a wall, the above-mentioned chambers are
combined with metal grilles welded to the flanks
of the chambers with the dual aim both of
strengthening the chambers themselves and
providing a structure usable for anchoring the
chambers to the wall.Two discrete types of the above chambers are
presently in production.The first type envisages the manufacturing of
monolithic boxes, made-to-measure according to the 
door dimensions.The second type uses modular structures wherein
the flanks are constructed using vertical fretted
metal panels arranged equidistantly and connected
on the contiguous sides of the chamber by means of
metal structural bars realising one vertical
stanchion and and two horizontal connecting bars,
one upper and one lower.In such a chamber, one vertical end is left open
so as to permit the door to slide in and out of
the chamber on special horizontal guides
associated to the upper connecting bar. This type
of chamber can also be lengthened by adding
further panels to the existing ones and thus
creating enough space to house a longer door.The panel connecting joints are obtained by
folding the edges of the metal panels so that
complementary geometrical shapes are obtained,
with the result that any two panels can be
connected by means of geometrical interference.
More precisely, the shaped edge of a panel is
inserted into a cavity made on a corresponding
edge of an adjacent panel by means of a relative
movement of the two panels along a tangential
direction to the lie plane of the flanks. A further characteristic of the known-type chamber
is that at the open end, where the door runs in
and out, means are afforded for anchoring wooden
(or other material) uprights to the chamber so
that it can be effectively masked from view.The means for anchoring uprights are T-shaped and
are arranged in such a way as that their wings are
flush with the flank of the chamber, while the
central body of the T inserts into a groove in the
upright and is anchored by means of screws driven
transversally across the central body of the T.The fundamental drawback of the

<CLAIMS>
A sliding door wall chamber, of the type
comprising flanks (10) constituted by metal panels

(3) arranged in succession and interconnected by
means of connecting joints (4) made on adjacent

edges (51, 52) of the panels (3), said edges (51,
52) being complementarily shaped such as to link

geometrically in a parallel direction to a lie
plane (9) of the panels (3), the chamber being

characterised in that the connecting joints (4)
are conformed in such a way that the edges (51,

52) are associable through reciprocal
superposition with transversal movement with

respect to the lie plane (9) of the panels (3) and
connect by means of geometrical interference.
A wall chamber as in claim 1, characterised in
that each connecting joint (4) comprises a first

elastically deformable L-shaped edge (51) which is
associated to a second edge (52) having at least

one wall (6) destined to interfre geometrically 
with the first edge (51) after a snap-fit of the

two edges (51, 52).
A wall chamber as in claim 1, characterised in
that the joint (4) comprises a first L-shaped edge

(51) associated to a second edge (52) having at
least one wall (6) destined to interfere

geometrically with the first edge (51), the second
edge (52) having an ingress opening (100) which is

inclined with respect to a horizontal plane so as
to allow unobstructed entry to the edge (51) when

the relative panel (3) is inclined to the same
degree as the opening (100) during its

association, while it constitutes a permanent
joint when the panel (3) returns to its natural

horizontal position.
A wall chamber as in claim 1, of the type
comprising a vertical bar (7) connected to an edge

(51 or 52) of a panel (3) of the flanks (10),
which bar (7) supports an upright (8) screwed to

the bar (7), the chamber being characterised in
that the bar (7) is Z-shaped, having a first wing

(15) fixed to the flank (10) as well as a central
bar (16) and a second wing (15) peripherally 

associable to the upright (8), permitting of a
visible connection of the upright (8) to the bar

(7).
