<ABSTRACT>
An electrical connection device, especially for passing heavy current, of the type including a fuse and two female terminals crimped onto power supply cables interacting with the said fuse. The device includes a connection module 3 clipped in with a box 2 between two positions, the first of which corresponds to the female terminals 6 passing through the box 2 and the module 3 to a position where the female terminals 6 are clipped into the module, and the second corresponds to the movement of the module 3 towards the interior of the box 2 up to a position for latching the female terminals 6 by an end piece 32 integral with the module 3.

<CLAIMS>
Electric connection device, notably for the 
leadthrough of high currents, of the type comprising a 

fuse and two socket lugs crimped onto feeding cables 
cooperating with said fuse, comprising a connection 

module (3) clipped into a box (2) between two 
positions, the first of which corresponds to the 

passing of the socket lugs (6) through the box (2) and 
module (3) up to the position in which the socket lugs 

(6) clip into the module (3), and the second of which 
corresponds to the displacement of the module (3) 

towards the interior of the box (2) up to the locking 
position of the socket lugs (6), characterized in that 

the box comprises a guideway (30) for guiding the 
socket lug (6) in accordance with the direction of 

insertion (A), and in that the socket lug (6) pushes 
back a head (32) integral with the module (3) to recess 

it into a housing (33) integral with the box (2) before 
reaching said first clipping position. 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the head (32) of the module (3) comes to bear 

against a wall (37) integral with the box (2) in order 
to constitute a rear stop preventing withdrawal of the 

socket lug (6). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the locking of the socket lug (6) is ensured by a 

stop (32) integral with the module (3). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the device further comprises a cover (4) which 

covers over the fuse (1) and module (3) by clipping 
over the box (2). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the device comprises a retaining element (5)  

 
tightly surrounding the feeding cables (7a, 7b). 
Device as claimed in claim 1, characterized in 
that the module (3) comprises at least one clip-in 

blade (16) with a stub capable of catching in a housing 
arranged in a socket lug (6) to make the latter 

integral with the module (3). 
Device as claimed in claim 5, characterized in 
that the retaining element (5) is constituted by the 

cooperation of two parts (50) fitting side by side 
along the diametral plane common to the tightly 

surrounded cables (21). 
Device as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that the two parts (50) cooperate according to two 

snap-in positions, the first of which corresponds to a 
separation enabling the feeding cables (7) to be 

inserted laterally (D), and the second of which 
corresponds to the flat side-by-side fitting and 

holding of said cables (7). 
Device as claimed in claim 7, characterized in 
that each part (50) comprises a guide bar (55 or 56) 

and a corresponding hole (57 or 58) to guide the 
sliding together of the two parts (50). 
Device as claimed in any one of the previous 
claims, characterized in that each socket lug (6) 

comprises four strips (18) making electric contact with 
the fuse (1). 
Device as claimed in claim 10, characterized 
in that the four strips (18) are offset type strips to 

ensure smooth plugging in of the fuse (1).
