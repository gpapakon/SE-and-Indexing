<ABSTRACT>
An aluminum alloy casting is provided high 
weldability by consisting of 3.5 to 12.0 Wt% of Si and 

hydrogen in a limited content to be less than or equal 
to 0.3 cc per 100g of alloy. The aluminum alloy 

casting thus has strength and ductility suitable for 
application to a joint for automotive frames.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum alloy
casting having high laser weldability and high strength and
ductility at a joint. The invention also relates to a
technology for improving overall strength, fatigue strength,
ductility and so forth of an aluminum alloy structural
member subjecting only a part thereof to a thermal treatment
(laser processing).In the recent years, in transporting equipments, such
as automotive vehicles, railway vehicles, ships, and so
forth, for demands for better fuel economy and higher speed,
lighter weight of structures perse and for lighter weight
of structural members to be employed in the light-weight
structures have been developed. For light-weight structural
member, the members of aluminum alloy are becoming to be
frequently employed in place of the conventional steel
member for lighter weight.As the aluminum alloy material, there are a variety of
materials, such as rolled material, extruded material, cast
material and so forth depending upon difference of the
production processes. Among these variety of aluminum alloy
materials, rolled materials and extruded materials have
relatively long stand achievement of use in the railway
vehicles and ships. The rolled materials are processes into
a desired configuration through press, bending and reducing
process and so forth. The extruded material is shaped into
a desired configuration of a hollow member and so forth
corresponding to a configuration of dies. Such processed
members are connected by welding, primarily by arc welding
so as to be assembled into a structure.On the other hand, the aluminum alloy casting has not 
been positively employed in a welded structure except for
repair welding. Also, since the aluminum alloy casting has
different mechanical performance of the products depending
upon the size, thickness and applied portion and so forth,
it may have relatively low reliability. This is also one of
the reasons why the aluminum alloy casting has small field
of application.U. S. Patent No. 4,618,163 discloses an automobile
chassis made from extruded light metal tubular rods held
together by connecting members also made from light metal.
The connecting members are die cast or forged members. It
has been known a technology for constructing an automotive
chassis structure by connecting the extruded frame of the
light metal by means of joints also made of the light metal,
for achieving the weight reduction of the vehicle. The
above-identified U. S. Patent further discloses employment
of the die cast of the light
