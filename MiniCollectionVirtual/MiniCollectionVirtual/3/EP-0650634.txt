<ABSTRACT>
A method for the preparation of a two-phase magnetic material comprising as the major phase a crystalline alloy of one or more rare earth metals, boron and iron, substantially all of the crystallites of which have a size of less than 35 nanometres, and as the minor phase (alpha)-Fe, which method comprises the steps of (i) melt spinning an alloy consisting of up to 12 atomic percent of one or more rare earth metals, 3 to 7 atomic percent of boron and the balance iron or a mixture of iron and cobalt; (ii) quenching the melt spun alloy from step (i) under conditions such that a mixture of crystalline and amorphous material is produced, (iii) subjecting the material from step (ii) to an annealing treatment under conditions such that controlled crystal growth occurs to provide the crystalline alloy phase, substantially all of which has a particle size of less than 35 nanometres, the resulting materials having a remanence in excess of the theoretical value of 0.8 Tesla.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to magnetic 
materials and, in particular, to two-phase magnetic 
materials comprising a mixture of a crystalline phase 
of an alloy of Fe, B and R, where R is a rare earth 
element and α-Fe. Magnetic materials and permanent magnets are 
important materials which are used in many fields, 
including electrical appliances and electronic 
devices. In view of the increasing requirement for 
miniaturization and the greater demands placed on 
electrical appliances and electronic devices there 
has been an increasing demand for improved magnetic 
materials and permanent magnets. EP-A-0101552 describes magnetic materials based 
on alloys of the type Fe-B-R containing at least one 
stable compound of the ternary Fe-B-R type, where R 
is a rare earth element including yttrium, which 
compound can be magnetized to become a permanent 
magnet. The amount of rare earth R is generally in 
the range of from 8 to 30 atomic percent. EP-A-0108474 describes a magnetically hard alloy 
composition comprising at least 10 atomic percent of 
one or more rare earth elements, 0.5 to 10 atomic 
percent of boron; and iron or mixtures of iron with a 
transition metal element, the alloy containing a 
major portion of a magnetically hard, fine 
crystallites having an average diameter of less than 
400 nanometres. The materials described in the above patents have 
generally exhibited the highest remanence when the 
percentage of rare earth present in the alloy is 
about 12 atomic percent. Previously, attempts to produce magnetically hard 
alloy compositions similar to those described in  
 
EP-A-0101552 and EP-A-0108474, but comprising less 
than 10 atomic percent of the rare earth metal, have 
produced products with a low remanence and energy 
product, the latter being attributed to the presence 
of α-Fe. Existing theories, such as those developed by 
Stoner and Wohlfarth, for the expected properties of 
isotropic permanent magnet materials, indicate that 
the remanence should not exceed half the value of the 
saturation magnetisation. For NdFeB, with a 
saturation of approximately 1.6 Tesla, the remanence 
should not be greater than 0.8 Tesla. This maximum 
value would apply to the stoichiometric composition 
of NdFeB (2:14:1), which corresponds to about 12 
atomic percent Nd, and deviation from this value in 
either direction will reduce the maximum achievable 
remanence. If the material can be produced such that 
the material structure is sufficiently fine and 
uniform, so that significant magnetic
