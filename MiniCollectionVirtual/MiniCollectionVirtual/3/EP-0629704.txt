<ABSTRACT>
A repeat insult microbial test method in which an 
antimicrobial agent is applied to a porous permeable 

substrate. The porous permeable substrate is inoculated with 
microorganisms and the porous permeable substrate is 

incubated for a predetermined period of time, at a 
temperature which is conducive to the flourishment of the 

microorganisms. The porous permeable substrate is 
reinoculated and reincubated a predetermined plurality of 

times and the inoculated porous permeable substrate is 
incubated for a final period of time between 18-24 hours at 

the temperature used previously. The porous permeable 
substrate is then examined and the growth of microorganisms 

is determined.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is a method of determining the 
effectiveness against microbial growth of certain 
antimicrobial agents, either alone or as an ingredient of 
various cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. More 
particularly, an "in vitro" test method has been devised 
which is capable of demonstrating the efficacy of an 
antimicrobial agent in a cosmetic or deodorant product. The test method of the invention mirrors "in vivo" 
efficacy and conditions and provides an indication of how 
well and for how long an antimicrobial agent is effective in 
a given product during use. In addition, the test method 
simulates (i) the dilution effect when the skin is subjected 
to sweat and microbial attack, and (ii) the diffusion effect 
of an antimicrobial agent away from the skin as a function 
of time. Cosmetic products are particularly vulnerable to 
contamination by microorganisms and, therefore, the control 
of microbial contamination is an important aspect of 
cosmetic manufacturing. Cosmetic products provide a good 
medium for the growth of various kinds of microorganisms, 
for such products contain water, oils, gums, protein, 
polyols and other nutrients which promote growth. The presence of viable organisms in cosmetic 
products can cause separation of emulsions, discoloration 
and the formation of unpleasant odors. Decomposition of 
some of the ingredients of a cosmetic product may lead to 
skin irritation and the presence of pathogenic organisms can 
place the user at the risk of infection. One safeguard used in the pharmaceutical and 
cosmetic industry has been to evaluate substances intended 
for the topical application to human skin, for their  
 
propensity to irritate and or sensitize the skin. 
Traditionally, it has been demonstrated that a product can 
be safely applied to human skin without significant risk of 
adverse reaction by "Repeated Insult Patch Testing". This 
"in vivo" procedure is a predictive patch study that can 
detect weak sensitizers that require multiple applications 
in order to induce a cell-mediated immune response 
sufficient to cause an allergic reaction. Such "in vivo" procedures are costly and time 
consuming and must be administered by qualified and 
specialized personnel who have been trained in the nuances 
of the test techniques. Typically, these tests involve the 
use of a study group of hundreds of volunteer subjects, who 
are under Federal regulations and are required to execute an 
informed consent document prior to entering the study. The 
study can extend over a six

A method for conducting a repeat insult 
microbial test comprising the steps of (i) applying an 

antimicrobial agent to a porous permeable substrate; (ii) 
inoculating the porous permeable substrate with at least one 

microorganism; (iii) incubating the inoculated porous 
permeable substrate for a first predetermined period of time, 

at a first temperature which is conducive to the flourishment 
of the microorganism; (iv) repeating the inoculating and 

incubating steps (ii) and (iii) a predetermined number of 
times but at least twice; (v) incubating the inoculated 

porous permeable substrate for a final predetermined period 
of time in excess of the first predetermined period of time 

and at the first temperature; the final incubation step (v) 
being carried out following the last inoculation in step 

(iv); and (vi) examining and determining the growth of 
microorganisms on the porous permeable substrate.

microorganism is selected from Staphylococcus aureus, 

Staphylococcus epidermis and E.coli.
