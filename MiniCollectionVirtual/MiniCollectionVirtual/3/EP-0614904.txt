Process for preparing isopropylidene derivatives of
saccharides which have two adjacent hydroxyl groups in

the cis position, characterised in that the mono-, di-
or polysaccharide is reacted with diketene or with the

addition product of diketene with acetone.
Process for preparing isopropylidene derivatives
according to claim 1, characterised in that the

saccharide is D-glucose, D-galactose, L-arabinose,
D-arabinose, fructose, sorbose, D-xylose, D-mannose,

D-ribose or D-mannitol, or that L-ascorbic acid is used.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that acetone is used as the reaction medium.
Process for preparing 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose
according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that

α-D-glucose is reacted with diketene in the presence of
a Lewis acid or a Brönsted acid in acetone at a

temperature in the range from 60 to 120°C, at the end of
the reaction the mixture is cooled, freed from any solid

constituents and then combined with the aqueous solution
of an alkaline-reacting compound, until a pH in the

range from 6 to 8 is achieved, the acetone is distilled
off, the residue is extracted with a water-immiscible

organic extraction agent, the combined extracts are
evaporated down, the residue is recrystallised from an

organic solvent and the 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose is
isolated.
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that
α-D-glucose is reacted with diketene in the presence of

boron halides or complex boron halides or in the
presence of an inorganic acid or an organic acid in

acetone at a temperature in the range from 80 to 100°C, 
after the reaction has ended the reaction mixture is

cooled, freed from solid constituents and then combined
with the aqueous solution of an alkaline or alkaline

earth metal hydroxide until a pH in the range from 6.5
to 7.5 is achieved, the acetone is distilled off, the

residue is extracted with a halogenated hydrocarbon, a

cycloalkane or an alkyl aromatic, the combined extracts
are evaporated down, the residue is recrystallised from

an alkane or a cycloalkane and the 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose
is isolated.
Process according to claim 4, characterised in that
α-D-glucose is reacted with diketene in the presence of

the boron trifluoride/diethylether complex at a
temperature of 90°C, after the reaction has ended the

reaction mixture is cooled, filtered and then dilute
sodium hydroxide solution is added until a pH of 7 is

achieved, the acetone is distilled off, the residue is
extracted with dichloromethane, the combined extracts

are evaporated down, the residue is recrystallised from
cyclohexane and the 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose is

isolated.
Process for preparing 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose
according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that

α-D-glucose is reacted with 2,2,6-trimethyl-1,3-dioxin-4-one
in the presence of a Lewis acid or a Brönsted acid

in acetone at a temperature in the range from 60 to
120°C, after the reaction has ended the reaction mixture

is cooled, freed from solid constituents and then the
aqueous solution of an alkaline-reacting compound is

added until a pH in the range from 6 to 8 is achieved,
the acetone is distilled off, the residue is extracted

with a water-immiscible organic extraction agent, the
combined extracts are evaporated down, the residue is

recrystallised from an organic solvent and the 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose
is isolated. 
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that
α-D-glucose is reacted with 2,2,6-trimethyl-1,3-dioxin-4-one

in the presence of boron halides or complex boron
halides or in the presence of an inorganic acid or an

organic acid in acetone at a temperature in the range
from 80 to 100°C, after the reaction has ended the

reaction mixture is cooled, freed from solid
constituents and then the aqueous solution of an

alkaline or alkaline earth metal hydroxide is added
until a pH in the range from 6.5 to 7.5 is achieved, the

acetone is distilled off, the residue is extracted with
a halogenated hydrocarbon, a cycloalkane or an alkyl

aromatic, the combined extracts are evaporated down, the
residue is recrystallised from an alkane or a

cycloalkane and the 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose is
isolated.
Process according to claim 7, characterised in that
α-D-glucose is reacted with 2,2,6-trimethyl-1,3-dioxin-4-one

in the presence of the boron trifluoridediethylether
complex at a temperature of 90°C, after the

reaction has ended the reaction mixture is cooled and
filtered and then dilute sodium hydroxide solution is

added until a pH of 7 is achieved, the acetone is
distilled off, the residue is extracted with

dichloromethane, the combined extracts are evaporated
down, the residue is recrystallised from cyclohexane and

the 1,2-5,6-diacetone-D-glucose is isolated.
