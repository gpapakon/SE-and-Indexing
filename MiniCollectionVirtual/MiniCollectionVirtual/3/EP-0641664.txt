<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a paper discharge apparatus (6) 
provided together with a printer (2) for discharging a printed matter such 

as a receipt and a ticket. The paper discharge apparatus (6) stores therein 
a paper (20) which is to be fed during printing and discharges the paper 

(20) upon completion of printing. It is possible to perform a stable printing 
operation and paper discharge operation because a recipient does not 

touch the paper (20) during printing. The paper discharge apparatus (6) 
stops the discharge of the paper (20) depending on stress applied to the 

paper (20) when the discharge of the paper (20) is obstructed, and it 
quickly restarts the discharge when the obstruction is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a paper discharge apparatus 
attached to a printer for use in discharging a continuous recorded paper 
such as a printed receipt, ticket, etc. In a conventional printer adapted for use in an issuing apparatus 
for issuing a receipt, ticket, etc., a continuous paper is printed and 
discharged, then cut off upon completion of printing. Fig. 21A shows an outer appearance of the conventional printer. A 
paper discharge port 306 is provided at a front surface panel portion 304 of 
an outer casing 302. A continuous paper 308 is discharged from the paper 
discharge port 306 depending on the printing operation while it is printed. 
A recipient can receive the discharged paper 308 while picking up it with 
fingers. Fig. 21B shows an internal structure of the conventional printer. 
There is formed a paper feed passage 310 which extends from the inside 
of the outer casing 302 to the paper discharge port 306. A paper feed 
mechanism 312, a print mechanism 314 and a cutter mechanism 316 are 
respectively provided on the paper feed passage 310. The paper feed 
mechanism 312 is a means for feeding the paper 308 in synchronization 
with printing. The paper feed mechanism 312 is provided with a pair of 
driving rollers 318 and 320. The paper 308 is guided between and clamped 
by the driving rollers 318 and 320 and fed out by the rotation of the driving 
rollers 318 and 320 while it is pressed by and brought into contact with the 
driving rollers 318 and 320. The print mechanism 314 comprises a print 
head 322 and a platen 324 which are confronted to each other while 
interposing the paper feed passage 310 therebetween. When the print  
 
head 322 is driven, the paper 308 is printed. Printing form is varied 
depending on the kind of the paper 308. If a heat sensitive paper is used, 
an ink ribbon is not needed while if an ordinary paper is used, a color 
medium such as the ink ribbon is needed. A cutter mechanism 316 is 
composed of an independent unit and contains therein a cutter blade 326 
which slides in the direction perpendicular to the feeding direction of the 
paper 308. The cutter blade 326 is driven by a slide driving mechanism. 
In the cutter mechanism 316, when the cutter blade 326 slides downward 
in Fig. 21B, the paper 308 is cut off. In this printer, the paper 308 is discharged from the port 306 while 
it is printed. Upon completion of printing, the paper 308 is discharged 
continuously by a given amount and cut off by the cutter blade 326 when 
the cutter blade 362

<CLAIMS>
A paper discharge apparatus (6) 
for discharging a printed paper from a printer (2) comprising: 


a paper feed means (8) for feeding a paper (20) to be printed or 
under printing; 
discharge rollers (68) and (70) for clamping and holding a leading 
end of the paper (20) which is fed by the paper feed means (8), the 

discharge rollers (68) and (70) discharging the paper (20) upon completion 
of printing; 
a paper storage means (58) for storing the paper in a slackened 
condition with the leading end thereof held by the discharge rollers (68) 

and (70); 
a paper discharge passage (60) for guiding the paper (20) which was 
discharged by the discharge rollers (68) and (70) to a paper discharge port 

(62); 
a paper detection sensor (76) for detecting the leading end of the 

paper (20) which passes thereunder along the paper discharge passage 
(60); 
a control means (110) for stopping rotation of a motor (26) for driving 
the discharge rollers (68) and (70) and at the same time operating the 

paper feed means (8) so as to feed the paper (20) toward the paper storage 
means (58) in a slackened condition when the paper detection sensor (76) 

detects the paper (20) which arrives thereunder, the control means (110)
