<ABSTRACT>
In order to carry out a fire extinguishing 
operation by ejecting a fire extinguishing gas having 

cooling and oxygen deficiency functions and a high 
fire extinguishing capacity from a plaurality of 

cylinders (5) in succession, a repeating injector is 
provided with an ejection mechanism which has a 

magazine (33) containing a plurality of cylinders (5) filled 
with such a fire extinguishing gas and detachably 

fixed to a receiver barrel (1) constituting an injector 
body, and which is adapted to break a seal member (6) on a 

head portion (7) of each of the cylinders (5) by a triggering 
operation and eject the fire extinguishing gas, and a 

cylinder renewing mechanism for discharging a 
cylinder (5), which has been subjected to the ejection of 

the fire extinguishing gas and become empty, by knob-pulling 
operation, and renewing the cylinder (5) 

successively. An emptied cylinder (5) is discharged by 
pulling a knob (27), and the cylinders (5) in the magazine (33) are 

sent sequentially to the interior of an extracrtor (18) in 
the receiver barrel (1), the seal member (6) on the head 

portion (7) of the cylinder (5) in the extractor (18) being broken 
by a firing pin (17) by a triggering operation, whereby the 

fire extinguishing gas is ejected from the cylinder (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a repeating injector 
for a fire extinguishing gas. Various types of fire extinguishers have 
heretofore been produced. One known example of the 
fire extinguisher is a gas fire extinguisher which 
uses a cylinder filled with a fire extinguishing gas, 
such as carbon dioxide in a liquefied state, and which 
is adapted to eject the gas as a fire extinguishing 
agent, for example, by manually breaking a seal member 
of this cylinder. The known fire extinguishers also 
include a fire extinguisher adapted to eject a 
powdered or water soluble fire extinguishing agent 
with a gas pressure. However, among these 
conventional fire extinguishers, a gas fire 
extinguisher is not speedily operated by hand, so that 
an efficient fire extinguishing action using the same 
cannot be made. When a fire extinguisher adapted to 
eject a powdered or water soluble fire extinguishing 
agent is used practicaly, the machines, instruments, 
clothes and documents installed, stored and placed in 
a room are damaged greatly due to the deposition of 
the fire extinguishing agent thereon during a fire 
extinguishing operation. It is also possible to use a  
 
fire extinguisher having a cylinder filled with a fire 
extinguishing gas under a high pressure, sealed at a 
head portion thereof with a seal member, and adapted 
to eject the fire extinguishing gas when the seal 
member at the head portion of the cylinder is broken 
forcibly by a manual operation. However, even in the 
case of this fire extinguisher in which only one 
cylinder filled with a fire extinguishing gas is 
installed, it is necessary to remove a cylinder which 
has become empty, and install a new cylinder filled 
with a fire extinguishing gas, by manual operations 
each time the ejection of the fire extinguishing gas 
is completed. Namely, since such a cylinder renewing 
operation takes much time, a fire extinguishing action 
cannot be carried out continuously with a high 
efficiency when a fire extinguishing purpose cannot be 
achieved with only one cylinder. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a repeating injector for a fire extinguishing gas 
which has a plurality of cylinders filled with a fire 
extinguishing gas of a high fire extinguishing 
capacity having a cooling function and an oxygen 
deficiency function, and which is capable of ejecting 
a fire extinguishing gas continuously in sequence like 
a machine gun making an efficient fire extinguishing 
action. Another object of the present invention is to 
provide a
