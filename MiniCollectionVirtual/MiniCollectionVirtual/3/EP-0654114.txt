<ABSTRACT>
A freely mountable device (1) with a vertical wall construction constituting a rail/fender on a balcony. It comprises a rail element which is self-supporting, mountable at the ends or connectable in several sections at an angle to one another, and that the rail element is flush with the veranda. The device (1) comprises known per se securing elements in the form of frames with attachment means for sealing the top and bottom of the rail element. Furthermore the frames form space structures to enable flower boxes, cladding, special elements, etc. to be added if desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device mountable on a balcony,
veranda or terrace, comprising a safety barrier for the
balcony, veranda or terrace, and may comprise known per se
securing elements in the form of frames with attachment means
for securing the frame to the top and bottom of the safety
barrier.There are two principal types of balcony/veranda/terrace
(henceforth referred to as balconies).One type, herein referred to as type A, usually has a depth
of 1.5 - 3.0 metres and a length of 5 - 7 metres. Type A
covers the entire area of the building construction, and is
closed at the sides with an opening in front. One example is
a concrete floor extending between two concrete slabs.A second type, herein referred to as type B, generally has
the same depth as type A, but with a length of 2 - 5 metres.
It is open on three of the sides and can be a projecting
concrete/steel floor, or be supported on pillars.When rehabilitating older buildings the balconies either have
to be demolished or repaired due to structural failure, such
as, e.g., carbonization of reinforced concrete structures due
to acid rain, or corrosion damage to steel structures. The
balconies are often too narrow, and it can be difficult and
expensive to extend the area due to static loads and/or the
position of windows.An additional problem, particularly for structures of type A,
is that an extension of the balcony depth cuts off daylight
to the rooms in the flats in the underlying floor. Older balconies in particular often have insufficient space
for a table with accompanying chairs or, e.g., for a place
for sunbathing. 1.8 metres is considered an absolute
minimum, but approximately 2 metres is a normal depth.Difficulties are often encountered with regard to flowers on
the balconies. Small flower boxes which are suspended from
the rail are the most common. These are often expensive and
not particularly durable, and they are so small that plants
dry out if they do not receive daily care in the form, e.g.,
of watering. Moreover, plant boxes of this kind have to be
suspended from the inside of the balcony rail if it is more
than 2 metres down to ground level.If large flower pots are placed on the balcony, the weight
can cause problems, especially since the weight can be more
than doubled if these are filled with water. Furthermore the
positioning can be unsuitable with regard to the static load.Concrete flower boxes, which act both as a flower box and a
rail, e.g. of the "Selvaag type", can only be used in new
buildings since the specific weight

<CLAIMS>
A device in combination with a balcony veranda or terrace, the device
comprising a safety barrier (9), which

is capable
of preventing, in normal use, an adult from falling from the

balcony, veranda or terrace,
and a plurality of frames (7,8;15,16;20,21;27;28;

29,30) arranged such that the frames project outwardly of the
outer edge of the balcony, veranda or terrace to define a

space lattice structure, characterised in that said safety
barrier is a vertical safety barrier which is disposed at the

outer edge of the balcony, veranda or terrace,
said space lattice structure

extending outwardly of said vertical safety barrier and
providing usable space outwardly of said vertical safety barrier, and in that the frames (27;28;29,30) are pivotally mounted so as to be pivotable to the outwardly projecting position.
A device according to claim 1, wherein the safety
barrier is a trusswork beam (9).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
material of the device (1) comprises laminated beams,

aluminium or steel.
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
the frames (7,8;15,16;20,21) are in the form of a

tetrahedron.
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
the frames are composed of or connected with stay elements

(7,8; 15).
A device according to claim 5, wherein the frames
and/ or stay elements are connected by joints in the form of

balls (16) with threaded holes and struts (15) with threads.
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
the space lattice structure comprises table tops, flower

boxes, screens (19), cupboard units, or the like. 
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
the device is constructed by means of welding, bolts and/or

fastenings.
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
the frames comprise modules consisting of 3-dimensional

cassettes (20,22) which are connected to one another.
A device according to any proceding claim , wherein the frames
(27) are also articulated.
A device according to any preceding claim, wherein
the space lattice structure provides support at a level below

the top of the safety barrier.
