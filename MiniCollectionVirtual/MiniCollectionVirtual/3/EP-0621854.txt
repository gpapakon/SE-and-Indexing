<ABSTRACT>
An alkaline earth bicarbonate is solubilized in water and contacted by a flue gas. The solubilized alkaline earth bicarbonate reacts with the SO2 in the flue gas to form an alkaline earth sulfite which readily precipitates from the water solution and is efficiently separated therefrom. In accordance with the invention, the slurry exiting the desulfurization step is subjected to a heating step which causes soluble alkaline earth bisulfite formed during the desulfurization step to convert to the insoluble sulfite. The solids are separated from the aqueous phase and subjected to thermal degradation to recover the alkaline earth oxide and SO2. The alkaline earth oxide can be recirculated and reused in the desulfurization process while the SO2, which has practical uses as a precursor in various chemical processes and therefore is of commercial value, is liquified. Thermal degradation of the solids from the desulfurization step is carried out in apparatus which includes a preheater zone, an ignition and heating chamber and a degradation zone. The thermal degradation is carried out in the presence of heated pellets which are themselves inert to the degradation reaction. Preferably, the pellets are heated in the ignition and heating chamber prior to contact with the solids from the desulfurization step.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DESULFURIZATION OF A GASField of the InventionThis invention relates to the treatment of gases for the removal ' of sulfur therefrom and more particularly to a continuous method for the treatment of flue gases and the like 5 to remove sulphur dioxide.Background of the InventionThe combustion of fossil fuels, particularly coal and high sulfur petroleum, leads to many environmental problems due to the generation of sulphur oxide products during the 10 combustion. These sulphur compounds, generally referred to as SOχ are the primary precursors to environmental problems such as acid rain which has recently gained much attention.Various methods have been utilized in the prior art for the treatment of the effluent from the combustion of such15 fossil fuels to remove the sulphur combustion products. For example, one method involves the creation of a water solution of sodium sulfite which is then contacted with the flue gas to produce acid sodium sulfite. The acid sodium sulfite is then treated with calcium carbonate or calcium hydroxide to20 generate calcium sulfite crystals which are subsequently oxidized to gypsum. A similar method involves a slurry of calcium hydroxide which is then contacted with the flue gas to produce calcium sulfite which is subsequently oxidized to gypsum. These methods present a major problem relating to the25 disposal of the large quantities of gypsum produced. Also, in the sodium sulfite process,disposal of the caustic soda produced by the process presents an additional environmental■- problem.Another method involves contacting the flue gas with a*30 slurry of magnesium oxide to form magnesium sulfite which may then be thermally decomposed to regenerate S02 and MgO. These operations are of low efficiency because the insolubility of the magnesium oxide only permits contact between the flue gas 

 and the surfaces of the magnesium oxide particles contained in the slurry. Once magnesium sulfite is formed on the surface of a particle, the inside of the particle is prevented from contact with the flue gas so that the ultimate reaction efficiency is substantially reduced. Because of the relative inefficiency of the desulphurization process, large amounts of reactant are required for the S02 removal and a substantial amount of unreacted MgO plus the MgS03 produced by the process results in a large bulk of material for thermal decomposition. It becomes necessary to use large indirect thermal heaters to carry out the decomposition process. These heaters are
