<ABSTRACT>
The cDNA which encodes heme-regulated eIF-2 alpha  kinase (HRI) has been cloned from a lambda Zap II cDNA library of rabbit reticulocytes. The rabbit HRI cDNA is highly homologous to human HRI and hybridizes to the human HRI DNA under moderately stringent conditions. The rabbit HRI cDNA contains 2729 amino acids. In vitro translation of HRI mRNA transcribed from HRI cDNA yields a 90 kDa polypeptide with eIF-2 alpha  kinase activity. Since HRI is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis, it is anti-proliferative in nature. In addition, the unusually high degree of homology of HRI to three protein kinases involved in the regulation of cell division suggests that HRI plays a direct role in the regulation of cell division. Since regulation of protein synthesis is vital for cell growth and differentiation, the cDNA can be inserted into cells to manipulate proliferation and differentiation, especially of cells that are proliferating in an uncontrolled manner or characterized by arrested differentiation, such as some of the types of cancers. Deletion mutants of HRI cDNA can be constructed that are insensitive to regulation by heme, which should be more effective than native HRI in its anti-viral and anti-proliferative action.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heme-regulated eukaryotic
initiation factor 2α kinase, certain modifications thereof and methods of use
thereof in inhibition of cellular proliferation.Heme controls the synthesis of protein in
reticulocytes. In heme-deficiency, there is
diminished initiation of protein synthesis with
disaggregation of polyribosomes. The principal
mechanism of the inhibition of initiation of protein
synthesis is the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of
the eukaryotic initiation factor 2, eIF-2α. In
addition to heme-deficiency, oxidized glutathione
(GSSG) and low levels of double stranded RNA inhibit
initiation by promoting phosphorylation of eIF-2α.The translation of mRNA in eukaryotic cells
occurs in the cytoplasm. In the first step of
initiation, free 80 S ribosomes are in equilibrium
with their 40 S and 60 S subunits. In the presence of
eIF-3, 40 S subunits bind the eIF-3 and eIF-4C to form
a 43 S ribosomal complex; the binding of eIF-3 and
eIF-4C to the 40 S subunit inhibits the joining of the
60 S subunit.In the next step, eIF-2 binds GTP and the
initiator tRNA, Met-tRNAf, in a ternary complex. The
binding by eIF-2 is specific for both guanine
nucleotides and for Met-tRNAf. The ternary complex now
binds to the 43 S ribosomal complex to form the 43 S
preinitiation complex. The 43 S preinitiation complex
binds mRNA in an ATP-dependent reaction in which eIF-4A,
eIF-4B, and eIF-4F form a complex with the mRNA.
The product of the binding of mRNA to the 43 S 
structure is bound close to the ribosome and the AUG
initiator codon is downstream from the cap structure.The joining of the 48 S preinitiation complex
and the 60 S subunit is catalyzed by eIF-5 which has a
ribosome-dependent GTPase activity. The joining
reaction is accompanied by the release of the
initiation factors eIF-3 and eIF-4C, eIF-2 is
translocated to 60 S subunit as a binary complex,
eIF2-GDP. The product of the joining reaction is the
80 S initiation complex. Formation of the active 80 S
initiation complex is the final step in initiation.
The Met-tRNAf is positioned in the P (peptidyl) site on
the ribosome for the start of polypeptide elongation.The sequence of steps in the process of
initiation affords several opportunities for
regulation. These include the recycling of eIF-2
after its release as the eIF-2-GDP complex; the
formation of the ternary complex; and the relative
affinities of mRNAs for eIF-2 and for eIF-4A, -4B, and
-4F in determining the relative rates of translation
of the mRNAs.A schematic summary of
