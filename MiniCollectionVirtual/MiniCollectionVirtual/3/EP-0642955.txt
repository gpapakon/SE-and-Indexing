<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a restraining device for articles which are loosely stored in a vehicle, the said device being composed of a gridlike or reticular element (1) which defines a restraining surface and of devices (4) for fastening the gridlike or reticular element (1) in a vehicle. In order to produce a restraining device which on the one hand can be easily mounted or dismounted, is easy to handle and is also easy to stow away, and on the other hand which displays a relatively small amount of flexibility in comparison with known, flexible nets and displays a much higher degree of safety, especially in the event of accidents, it is proposed according to the invention for a flexible and essentially linear clamping element (3) which can be subjected to tensile stress and is at least partly guided by the fastening devices (4) and a tensile stress exerting device (2) to be provided, mounts (5) for the gridlike or reticular element (1) being provided on the clamping element (3) and it being possible for the tensile stress exerting device (2) to be used to increase the tensile stress in the clamping element (3) to a desired value or to decrease it, for the purpose of disassembly, for example.

A restraining device for items which are stowed loosely in a 
vehicle, comprising a grill-like or mesh-like element (1) defining a 

restraining surface, and fixing devices (4) for fixing the grill or mesh 
element (1) to the vehicle, wherein there are provided a flexible and 

substantially linear bracing element (3) which can be subjected to a 
tensile force and which is passed at least partially through the fixing 

devices (4), and a tensioning device (2), characterised in that disposed 
on the bracing element (3) are holders (5) for the grill or mesh element 

(1), wherein the tensile force in the bracing element (3) can be increased 
to a desired value or reduced for example for the purposes of dismantling, 

by means of the tensioning device (2). 
A restraining device according to claim 1 characterised in that 
the bracing element (3) is movable in the longitudinal direction relative 

to the mesh holders (5). 
A restraining device according to claim 2 characterised in that 
the mesh holders (5) have tubular guide openings (23) for the bracing 

element (3). 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 3 
characterised in that the tensioning device (2) has a winding device (11, 

12, 13) with a ratchet mechanism (14, 15). 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 4 
characterized in that the bracing element extends at least predominantly 

along the outside contours of the grill or mesh element (1). 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 5 
characterised in that the outside contours of the grill or mesh element 

(1) extend in a trapezoidal configuration. 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 6 
characterised in that the bracing element is a cable comprising a 

resilient material.  
 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 6 
characterized in that the bracing element is a steel cable or strip. 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 8 
characterized in that the fixing devices (4) are substantially rigid 

elements with guide eyes (19) or rollers for the bracing element (3). 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 9 
characterized in that the fixing devices (4) have plastically deformable 

absorbing elements (7) for carrying load peaks. 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 10 
characterized in that the fixing devices are lockable to parts (21) 

rigidly connected to the vehicle body. 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 11 
characterized in that the bracing element (3) comprises a one-piece 

portion extending around the grill-like or mesh-like element in the 
proximity of the outer edge thereof. 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 12 
characterized in that the tensioning device (2) is a detour-route guide 

means (35, 27, 28, 31) for the bracing element (3). 
A restraining device according to claim 13 characterized in that 
the lower edge of the grill or mesh element (1) is at a spacing relative 

to the floor of the vehicle and that there are provided tensioning devices 
(35, 27) through which the bracing element (3) is drawn in the form of a U-shaped 

loop from the lower edge of the mesh in the direction of the 
vehicle floor. 
A restraining device according to one of claims 1 to 14 
characterized in that it has at least one stiffening element (26) which 

extends between portions of the bracing element (3) and/or the edge of the  
 

grill or mesh element (1), which portions are spaced from each other and 
do not extend along the same straight line, and the stiffening element 

holds said portions at the spacing predetermined by the stiffening element 
(26).
