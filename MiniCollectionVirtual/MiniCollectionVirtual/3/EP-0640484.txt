<ABSTRACT>
An ink filling method for filling an ink 
cartridge with ink to be supplied to a recording head 

for ejecting ink includes providing an ink cartridge 
having a negative pressure producing material 

accommodating portion (4) and an ink accommodating 
portion (6), the negative pressure producing material (3) 

accommodating portion accommodating a negative 
pressure producing material (3) and being provided with an 

air vent (10), and the ink accommodating portion being 
substantially hermetically sealed except for fluid 

communication with the negative pressure producing 
material accommodating portion (4), and accommodating 

directly the ink to be supplied to the recording head, 
the ink cartridge further includes a partition wall (5) 

between the negative pressure producing material 
accommodating portion and the ink accommodating 

portion, the partition wall (5) being provided with a gap (8) 
for permitting formation of meniscus of the ink; and 

directly injecting the ink into the ink accommodating 
portion (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink
filling method and
an ink filling system comprising an ink filling
apparatus and an ink cartridge.A recording apparatus such as a printer,
copying machine, facsimile machine or the like and a
recording apparatus used as an output apparatus of a
combined electronic apparatuses or work station
including computer, word processor or the like, is
constituted such that image is recorded on a recording
material such as a sheet of paper or plastic material
in accordance with image information. The recording
apparatuses can be classified into an ink jet type, a
wire dot type, a thermal type, a laser beam type and
so on on the basis of recording system.In an ink jet type recording apparatus, ink
is ejected onto a recording material through recording
means (recording head). It comprises the following
advantages. The recording means can be significantly
downsized, and fine images can be recorded at a high
speed. The recording is possible without particular
treatment on plain paper. The running cost is low,
and the noise is low because it is a non-impact type
apparatus. In addition, it is easy to effect color
image recording use different color inks. Among ink jet recording means, an ink jet
recording means (recording head) using thermal energy
to eject the ink is advantageous in that high density
liquid paths (ejection outlets) can be easily provided
by the use of electrothermal transducers, electrodes,
liquid passage walls and top plate produced through
semiconductor manufacturing process including etching,
evaporation, sputtering and so on. Therefore, further
downsizing is possible.An ink container used with the ink jet
recording apparatus is required to supply in good
order an amount of the ink corresponding to the
ejections of the ink through the recording head by the
recording operation and is required not to leak the
ink through the ejection outlets when the recording
operation is not carried out.Additionally, in the case that the ink
container is a replaceable or exchangeable type, it is
also required that the mounting and demounting of the
ink container is smooth without ink leakage, thus
assuring the ink supply to the recording head.As an example of an ink container usable with
an ink jet recording apparatus, Japanese Laid-Open
Patent Application No. 87242/1988 (first prior art)
discloses an ink jet recording cartridge comprising an
ink container, a foamed material therein and a
plurality of ink ejection orifices. With such a container, a negative pressure
production
