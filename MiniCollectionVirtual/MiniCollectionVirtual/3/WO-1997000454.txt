<ABSTRACT>
An equipment has a transducer (G) that receives signals from a number of objects with unknown positions and senses the directions from the transducer to the objects. The directions of the sight lines to the objects are sensed in at least two separate transducer locations. The transducer signals are supplied to a calculation means (CU) which calculates the positions of the objects.

<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINAΗON OF OBJECTS POSITIONS AND EQUIPMENT TO PRODUCE A SET OF OBJECTS WITH KNOWN POSITIONSTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a method of determining the position of objects in equipment comprisingat least one transducer designed to receive signals from a set of objects arranged to emit signals that propagate linearly between the objects and the transducer,and members arranged to produce direction-defining signals that define the direction of the sight lines from the transducer to the objects in relation to the transducer.The invention also relates to an arrangement for creating a set of objects with known positions for equipment of the above type.The following terms are used in this application: the location of an object is defined by the position and/or orientation of the object; the position of an object is determined by a number of translation coordinates; the orientation of an object is determined by a number of rotational coordinates.Furthermore, the term object denotes an object able to emit signals that can be received by the transducer, that is to say signals that propagate linearly between the object and the transducer. Such signals are primarily optical signals with frequencies within the visible wavelength range or outside this range, such as infrared light. Examples of objects are light sources (e.g. light bulbs or light-emitting diodes), reflectors (e.g. markers of reflecting tape) or details of the transducer's surroundings identifiable by means of image analysis (e.g. corners, holes, light points or markers having a certain shape and with a colour or brightness that deviates from the surroundings). Alternatively other signal forms may be used, e.g. ultrasonic or microwave signals, in which case the objects, for instance, consist of sources or 

reflectors for these signals, for instance.BACKGROUND ARTA position transducer arrangement is known through the Swedish patent specification No. 444 530. This arrangement preferably utilizes optical signals. An optical transducer is designed to sense the direction from the transducer to each of a number of light sources, whose positions in relation to each other are known. The transducer determines the directions to at least three such light sources. The arrangement has calculation means which, on the basis of the directions thus determined, determine the angles between the sight lines from the transducer to the light sources and which, on the basis of these directions and angles and of the known positions of the
