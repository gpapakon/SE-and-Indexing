<ABSTRACT>
A flexible polymeric sheet foam having insulating and moisture vapor retardant properties is installed beneath the interior surfaces drywall of a home. The flexible sheet foam may be located across or between wooden members which define the structure of the home. The sheet foam reduces energy losses between the interior of the home and the outdoors as a result of thermal conduction through wooden members of the home. The sheet foam may be fabricated by extruding a thermoplastic polymeric resin, and foamed by expansion or blowing agents.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLEA flexible polymeric foam for use as an insulator and a moisture retardant and a process for producing it.FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe invention relates to a flexible polymeric foam sheet which is useful as an insulator and moisture vapor retardant.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONIn conventional wall framing techniques which are used for construction of residential homes, as much as 23 % of the wall is wood. For example, wood members comprise the wall studs, trimmers, nailers, headers, among others. The remainder of the cavity defined within the residential wall is generally filled with insulation. The R or insulation value of the cavity may range from 19 to 21, however, the R value of the wood is approximately 1 per inch. As a result, energy loss occurs across or through the wood members which have a relatively low insulation value. In other words, the wood members conduct energy from the interior of the home to the outdoors, or vice versa. In typical residential home construction, a thin polyethylene sheet is installed directly over the wooden members, and drywall in affixed to the wooden members through the polyethylene sheet. While this sheet functions as a vapor moisture retardant, the sheet has a nominal R value, and accordingly, lacks i y significant affect on energy conduction through the wooden members. 
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a flexible foam sheet which improves the insulation characteristics of structures within a home having wooden members, and also functions as a moisture vapor retardant. The flexible foam sheet may be incorporated during construction of residential homes by installing the flexible foam sheet across or between the wooden members on the interior face or side of the wooden members, and thereafter affixing drywall through the foam and into the wooden members, e.g., a nail or screw is driven through the drywall and the foam sheet, and into the wooden members. After having installed the foam sheet, the wooden members are insulated from the drywall or the interior of the home; thereby increasing the R value of the wall, reducing moisture vapor permeation, and exfiltration of conditioned interior air, e.g., heated or cooled air. The seams between the foam sheet may be sealed before installation of the drywall, thereby permitting the foam to function as a secondary air infiltration barrier.The flexible foam sheet is produced by extrusion using conventional foam systems such as tandem, screw, stretched single screw, among others.

 THE FOLLOWING IS CLAIMED.
1. A process for producing a polymeric foam sheet comprising: heating a polymeric resin to a temperature sufficient to provide a 5 molten polymer, wherein at least a portion of said resin comprises recycled resin, adding and mixing at least one blowing agent with said molten polymer to provide a plasticized mixture, heating the mixture to a temperature and applying a pressure such that the plasticized mixture such that the plasticized mixture substantially does not 10 foam, thereafter, reducing the temperature of the mixture to increase the viscosity of said mixture; and extruding the plasticized mixture into a foam sheet having a density from about 2.0 to 8.0 pounds per cubic foot.
15 2. The process of Claim 1 wherein said resin comprises at least one of polyethylene, polystyrene, an ionomeric resin, and polypropylene.
3. The process of Claim 2 wherein said resin comprises polyethylene.
20 4. The process of Claim 1 wherein said blowing agent comprises at least one of HFC-152a, HFC-134a, dimethlyether, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.
5. A foam sheet product formed according to the process of Claim 3.
25 6. A foam sheet product formed according to the process of Claim 4.
7. The process of Claim 1 further comprising laminating at least one facing material onto at least one surface of the foam sheet.
30 8. A process for improving the moisture vapor permeation and reducing the thermal conductivity of a home comprising: providing a structural member of a home having an exterior face, affixing at least one polymer foam sheet, having a density of about 2.0 s to 8.0 pounds per cubic foot, to the interior face of the structural member, and; 35 installing an interior surface member upon the polymer foam sheet. 


 9. The process of Claim 8 wherein said polymer foam sheet comprises polyethylene.
10. The process of Claim 8 wherein said structural member comprises at least one a wall, floor, and ceiling.
11. The process of Claim 8 wherein said interior surface member comprises at least one of drywall and carpeting.
12. The process of Claim 8 further comprising sealing the seams between said foam sheets.
13. The process of Claim 8 wherein said foam sheet further comprises a laminate.
14. An improved wall formed in accordance with the process of Claim 8.
15. An improved floor formed in accordance with the process of
Claim 8.
