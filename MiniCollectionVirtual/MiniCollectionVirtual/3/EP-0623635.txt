<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to amine functionalized polyesters. More
particularly, the present invention relates to polyester resins functionalized with
aromatic amines. Most particularly, the present invention relates to polyesters
having free aromatic amine functionality in the polymer.Polyesters, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) or PET, and
poly(butylene terephthalate) or PBT, are widely used in the preparation of
articles by forming methods such as injection molding and tube extrusion. Many
of their properties, including chemical stability, solvent resistance and low
permeability to gases, make them attractive candidates for such forming
operations as blow molding, profile extrusion and thermoforming.Additionally, polyester resins modified with linear amines have found use
in various commercial applications. For example, Marcus, United States Patent
No. 3,886,230, teaches that dyeable polyesters can be prepared by blending
conventional polyesters with modified polyesters containing a
di(hydroxyalkyl)amine polymerized in the molecule. Pacifici et al., United States
Patent No. 4,374,716, teach the use of polyesters prepared from glycols
containing a linear tertiary amine in UV curable compositions.EP-A-0272992 discloses a thermotropic, aromatic polyester containing
repeating units derived from an aromatic diol, an aromatic dicarboxylic acid, p-aminobenzoic
acid and a difunctional ether.BE-A-649576 discloses a polyester containing repeating units derived
from ethylene glycol, trimellitic acid and p-aminobenzoic acid. The polyester is
used as a binder for an electrically insulating varnish. However, none of the prior art references teach or suggest a polyester
resin having free amine functionality in the polymer. The prior art references
teach only the reaction of polyesters with linear amines which provides a
polymer having amide linkages. Surprisingly, it has now been found that
polyesters having free aromatic amine functionality can be provided by reacting
the polyester with an aromatic amine acid, ester or alcohol.According to the present invention there is provided an aromatic
amine-functionalized polyester resin having free aromatic amine functionality
consisting of units derived from:
(a) a diol selected from tetramethylene glycol, ethylene glycol, trimethylene
glycol, 2-methyl-1,3 propane glycol, decamethylene glycol, cyclohexane
dimethanol, neopentylene glycol, 1,3-propylene glycol, 1,6-hexanediol, and
mixtures thereof;(b) a dicarboxylic acid or ester forming reactive derivative thereof;
