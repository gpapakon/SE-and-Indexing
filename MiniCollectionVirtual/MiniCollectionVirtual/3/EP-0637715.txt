<ABSTRACT>
A lamp (bulb) (5) is inserted into an opening (4) at the apex of a reflector (3) of a vehicle headlamp (headlight) from the rear of the headlamp. The cap (base) (6) of the lamp (5) has a circumferential flange (11) with positioning flaps (12) which extend radially outwards. The opening (4) of the reflector (3) is surrounded by a locking ring (15) which is made of plastic and on which resilient tongues (16) are integrally formed. The lamp (5) can be guided through with its positioning flaps (12) between the tongues (16) and, after a subsequent rotation about its longitudinal axis, engages beneath the resilient tongues (16). The resilient tongues (16) bear in the final position of the lamp (5) with prestress against the positioning flaps (12) and press the lamp (5) with its flange (11) against a bearing surface (26) which is directed towards the lamp (5) and is formed by an inner edge section which is integrally formed on the locking ring (15). The inner edge section (21) is arranged between the resilient tongues (16) and the reflector (3) at a distance from the resilient tongues (16).

A device for the detachable locking of a lamp (5) to a reflector (3) of a vehicle 
headlamp, having an opening (4) which is provided in the reflector (3) and which 

serves to receive a lamp (5) which can be passed through the opening (4) in the 
reflector (3), from the back of the reflector (3), with its glass bulb (8) in front and 

which has a base (6) with a surrounding flange (11) from which positioning rabs (12) 
extend radially outwards, and having a locking ring (15) which surrounds the opening 

(4) in the reflector (3) and which is fixed to the reflector (3), which locking ring is 
made of plastic on which resilient tongues (16) are integrally formed, between which 

the positioning tabs (12) of the lamp (5) can be passed and which engage above the 
positioning tabs (12) after a subsequent rotation of the lamp (5) about its longitudinal 

axis, wherein the positioning tabs (12) slide along a run-on face (27) of the tongues 
(16) until, in the final position of the lamp (5), the tongues (16) are seated under an 

initial stress against, the positioning tabs (12) and press the flange (11) of the base (6) 
against a contact face (26) oriented opposite to the direction of insertion of the lamp 

(5), characterised in that the locking ring (15) consists, as one piece, of the resilient 
tongues (16) and of an inner edge section (21) which extends between the resilient 

tongues (16) and the reflector (3) at a distance from the run-on faces (27) of the 
tongues (16), and the face of which inner edge section which faces the tongues (16) 

comprises the contact face (26) for the flange (11) of the base (6) of the lamp (5). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in that an outer ring section (17) of the 

locking ring (15) extends between two adjacent tongues (16) and is offset towards the 
reflector (3), and the inner edge section (21) is integrally formed on the ring sections 

(17). 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the inner edge section (21) 
is of an encircling design, and radially outwardly oriented wall sections (22) thereof 

extend below the respective tongue (16).  
 
A device according to claim 3, characterised in that the wall sections (22) of the inner 
edge section (21) are formed from a one-piece annular disc which extends at a 

distance from the resilient tongues (16). 
A device according to claim 2 or 4, characterised in that the resilient tongues (16) are 
each attached to the annular disc which is disposed offset towards the reflector (3) by 

sidewalls (23), the inner faces of which, which adjoin the underside of the tongues 
(16), extend in such a way that they can be demouled, together with the underside 

of the tongues (16) and the face of the wall sections (22) facing the tongues (16), 
using an adjustable mould part which is adjusted radially outwards when the locking 

ring (15) is demoulded. 
A device acccording to claim 5, characterised in that for tongues (16) which have free 
ends which are oriented radially inwards, each tongue (16) is joined at the outer 

narrower edges of its root, via a sidewall (23), to the annular disc, and the inwardly 
oriented edges of the sidewalls (23) disposed between two tongues (16) extend into 

a rib (28) which joins them and which is integrally formed on the disc. 
A device according to claim 5 or 6, characterised in that at least one sidewall (23) is 
extended radially inwards by an amount such that the inner face of its extension (36) 

serves as a stop for a positioning tab (12) of the lamp (5) when the lamp (5) is in its 
final position. 
A device according to any one of claims 4 to 7, characterised in that the central 
opening (29) of the annular disc is surrounded by a collar (30) which is directed 

towards the reflector (3) and which extends into the opening in the reflector (3) 
substantially free from play, and the inner face of which serves for the radial fixation 

of the lamp (5). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the 
locking ring (15) on the annular disc has fixing means (18) by which it can be joined 

to the reflector (3).  
 
A device according to any one of claims 4 to 9, characterised in that the annular disc 
is of dish-shaped design, wherein the dish is open towards the reflector (3). 
A device according to claim 10, characterised in that the cylindrical lateral boundary 
(32) of the dish is seated with its free end section against the back of the reflector (3). 
A device according to claim 10 or 11, characterised in that the external surface of the 
lateral boundary (32) of the dish-shaped disc serves as a contact face (26) for an 

annular rubber cap (38) which surrounds the locking ring (15) under an initial stress, 
the outer surrounding edge of which rubber cap can be placed on an opening (37) in 

a housing (1) of the vehicle headlamp. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterised in that the resilient 
tongues (16) have an edge section (25) which is oriented opposite to the direction of 

insertion of the lamp (5) at their inwardly oriented free end. 
A device according to any one of claims 1 to 13, characterised in that the thickness 
of the resilient tongues (16) diminishes towards their free end. 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that resilient 
tongues (16) are each attached at their roots (41), by a single sidewall (23), to the 

annular disc, and the longitudinal extent of the resilient tongues extends concentrically 
with the longitudinal axis of the lamp (5). 
A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that fixing 
means (43), by which the locking ring (15) can be fixed to a supporting structure 

(44), are provided at the outer edge section (42) of the lateral boundary (32) of the
