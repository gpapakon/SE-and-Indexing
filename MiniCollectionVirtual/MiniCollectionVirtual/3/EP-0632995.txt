<ABSTRACT>
The invention proposes a dental X-ray diagnostic device for producing tomosynthetic images of objects, in particular of the skull of a patient, using a pantomograph with an X-ray tube assembly (3) and a recording unit (4) arranged diametrically opposite the tube assembly. The device comprises means (D1) which permit the height of the X-ray tube assembly to be adjusted in a defined way and the tube assembly to be pivoted about a vertical and a horizontal axis in such a way that one object point is irradiated from several projection directions preferably lying in different planes.

whose width is matched to the width or length of the
body part to be imaged, there being present adjusting

means (D1, D4) which adjust the line scanning detector
camera with respect to the body part such that the slit

opening is moved along the body part, the fan beam
limited by the beam diaphragm (52, 12) of the radiation

source (3) being co-moved synchronously with the camera
movement.
X-ray diagnostic device according to Claim 7,
in which the X-ray detector is a CCD sensor which is

constructed from one or more rows and contains a
scintillation layer situated in front.
X-ray diagnostic device according to one of
