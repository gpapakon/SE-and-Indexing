<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a computer system with at least one microprocessor and a coprocessor, the coprocessor (COP) being hardware configured so that the function performed by the coprocessor is adjustable in dependence on the program to be executed. The coprocessor is made up of functional units which each can execute one function and programmable wiring channels which permit a connection to be established between each functional unit and the microprocessor. When an application program is executed, it is thus possible to configure one or more coprocessors according to the program code and hence accelerate program execution.

<CLAIMS>
Method of operating a computer system comprising at 
least one microprocessor (MP) and coprocessors (COP), in 

which the coprocessor (COP) is made up of a plurality of 

functional units (F(i)), each of which is specialized for 
the execution of a function, in which, for a user program 

to be processed, the command sequences which can be 
executed by a coprocessor are established during the 

compiling of said program, and in which, according to the 
established command sequence, one of the functional units 

of the coprocessor is selected and connected to the 
microprocessor (MP). 
Method according to Claim 1, in which, for the 
configuring of the coprocessor (COP), there is inserted 

by the compiler into the compiled program a configuration 
code by which the configuration of the coprocessor is 

initiated during the running of the program.
