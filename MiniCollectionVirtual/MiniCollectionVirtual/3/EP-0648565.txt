<ABSTRACT>
A device for connecting to the head (12) of a machine 
tool an instrument (1) for measuring micrometric lengths 

on a calibrated scale of the type including a casing (2) 
carrying a feeler (6) and a dial (8) for reading the 

extent of the movement of the feeler (6) relative to the 
casing (2). The device includes a body (14) with a seat 

(72) for receiving the feeler (6) of the instrument (1), 
a rotatable shaft (18) able to translate axially relative 

to the body (14) and transmission means operable to move 
the feeler (6) by an amount proportional to the axial 

movement of the shaft (18) relative to the body (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for connecting 
an instrument for measuring micrometric lengths on a 
calibrated scale to the head of a machine tool such as a 
milling machine or a boring machine for example. In machining carried out by means of a cutting tool which 
is movable relative to the workpiece (typically during 
drilling, milling, boring, turning and similar operations), 
it is necessary to position the tool-carrying 
head of the machine in a reference position relative to 
the workpiece before beginning the machining. This operation is normally carried out with the 
assistance of a machine known as a comparator which 
includes a casing with a feeler movable along the 
longitudinal axis thereof and a measuring mechanism 
capable of measuring the extent of the axial movements of 
the feeler rod with an accuracy up to a thousandth of a 
millimetre. The comparator is connected to the tool-carrying 
head and this is moved until the readings of the 
instrument show the head has reached a predetermined 
position relative to the workpiece.  The disadvantage which is most frequently encountered 
during the positioning of the machine tool relative to 
the workpiece is the difficulty of reading the instrument 
which, being fitted to the head of the machine, rotates 
therewith and is often in positions in which the dial of 
the instrument faces away from the operator, making it 
very difficult to read the measurements. In order to overcome this disadvantage, the object of the 
present invention is a device for connecting an 
instrument to the head of a machine tool, characterised 
in that it includes: 
a body with a seat for receiving the feeler of the 
instrument, a rotatable shaft able to perform axial translations 
relative to the body, and transmission means able to move the feeler of the 
instrument by an amount proportional to the extent of the 
axial movement of the shaft relative to the body. Thanks to this arrangement, it is possible to release the 
instrument from the rotation of the tool-carrying head of 
the machine and to centre the tool-carrying head relative 
to holes in the workpiece while keeping the dial of the 
instrument constantly facing the operator. Additional characteristics and advantages of the 
invention will become apparent from the detailed  
 
description provided hereafter purely by way of non-limitative 
example, with reference to the appended 
drawings, in which:

the said transmission m
eans include a rocker element (94) 
pivoted on the body (14) and having a first lever arm 

(92) bearing against a shoulder (90) of the shaft (18) 
 

and a second lever arm (100) against which an end of the 
feeler (6) of the instrument (1) is intended to bear. 
A device according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that it includes a feeler 

mechanism which includes a feeler member (40) rockable 
about an axis (48) orthogonal to the translational axis

the said resilient means includes a coil spring (56) 

coaxial with the shaft (18) and interposed between a 
shoulder (60) of the shaft (18) and a shoulder (64) of
