<ABSTRACT>
A pharmaceutical composition comprising 24, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol 
is useful for the remedy or prophylaxis 

of disorders associated with renal osteodystrophy. The active 
compound, 24, 25-(OH)₂-D₃, alone unexpectedly not only improves 

bone quality but also prohibits bone mass decreases in renal 
osteodystrophy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an agent for alleviating 
symptom in renal osteodystrophy, which comprises an effective 
amount of 24, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (hereinafter sometimes 
referred to as 24, 25-(OH)₂-D₃ or the active compound of the 
present invention) in admixture with a pharmaceutically 
acceptable carrier. In particular, the agent is useful in 
prohibiting a decrease in bone mass in renal osteodystrophy. A renal dysfunction leads to abnormal calcium and 
phosphate metabolism and to aberrant vitamin D activation, 
which induce renal osteodystrophy. Renal osteodystrophy is histologically classified 
into osteomalacia type, osteitis fibrosa type, mixed type, low 
turnover type, and mild type, according to the pathogenesis and 
histological evaluation. It is thought that the renal 
osteodystrophy is a disease wherein bone quality changes, in 
contrast to osteoporosis, wherein bone mass decreases. From 
the histological evaluation of bone biopsy specimens, even 
though there are some differences in the degree of bone lesion, 
it is thought that there are abnormalities of bone in almost 
all bone histological specimens from renal insufficient 
patients. Further, a recent technological advance using 
photon-energy of single wavelength for a quantitative 
measurement of bone mass enables the assessment of bone mass 
quantitatively.  Since it is possible to measure quantitatively bone 
mass of the whole bone by means of such photoenergetic method 
in contrast to a conventional observation by an X-ray technique 
or a histological evaluation on bone tissues, this method is 
clinically quite useful. Consequently, it has been revealed 
that bone mass in renal osteodystrophy patients, who have 
increased risk of bone fractures decreases. However, the 
pathogenesis thereof is still indistinct with an unclear 
relation to biochemical markers or hormones related with bone 
metabolism. Therefore, it may take time to solve these 
problems through future extensive researches. In order to treat diseases in a renal insufficient 
patient, vitamin D has been administered, together with dieting 
and dialysis to control blood phosphate and to prevent 
hypocalcemia. Specifically, vitamin D₃ or its metabolite is 
effective in preventing hypocalcemia by promoting calcium 
absorption from the intestine. Furthermore, vitamin D₃ or its 
metabolite has been widely applied to renal insufficient 
patients, especially for the case where secondary 
hyperparathyroidism is observed because it has an inhibitive 
action against
