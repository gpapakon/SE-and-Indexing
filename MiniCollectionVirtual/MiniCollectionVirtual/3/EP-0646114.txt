<DESCRIPTION>
5-(l,2,4-Triazol-l-ylmethyl )-3H-i sobenzofuran-l-one derivatives, their preparation and use as aromatase inhibitorsThis invention relates to heterocyclic compounds which are inhibitors of the enzyme aromatase, to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in medicine.Oestrogens are responsible for many physiological functions in both females and males. Their action is mediated by specific intracellular hormone receptors expressed in oestrogen responsive cells. Oestradiol, the major oestrogen, is produced from oestrone which in turn is produced from androstenedione by aromatization of the A-ring. This reaction is catalysed by the predominantly ovarian enzyme aromatase although in post menopausal women aromatase located in adipose tissue is responsible for the synthesis of oestrogens (O'Neill and Miller, Br.J.Cancer (1987)).Oestrogens are agonists in responsive tissues, such as breast, and are a major factor in the development of breast tumours. Thus, aromatase inhibitors have valuable therapeutic potential for the treatment of oestrogen responsive diseases, particularly breast cancer (Brodie, ISI Atlas of Science: Pharmacology (1987) 266-269 and Santen et al.. J.Lab.Clin.Med. (1987) 109:278-289) and have been the subject of active research world-wide, see for example, the work of Schieweck et al.. Cancer Res. (1988) 48:834-838; Wouters et al.. J.Steroid Biochem., (1989) 32:781-788; Bhatnagar et al.. J. Steroid Biochem., (1990) 37:1021-1027.We have now found a novel group of compounds which are potent and selective aromatase inhibitors.Thus the present invention provides a compound of general formula (I) 

 wherein R1 represents a cyano or nitro group;R2 represents hydrogen or one or more halogen atoms;R3 represents a Ci.βalkyl group and R4 represents hydrogen or aC-j .galkyl group or R3 and R4 together represent a C3.gcycloalkyl group; andR5 represents hydrogen or one or more halogen atoms or C-i^alkoxy groups and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof.As used herein an alkyl or alkoxy group may be a straight or branched chain group, for example an alkyl group is conveniently a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or butyl group. Halogen atoms include fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms.The compounds of formula (I) contain at least one chiral carbon atom. It is to be understood that formula (I) is intended to encompass all enantiomers of the compounds of the invention as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures.In a preferred
