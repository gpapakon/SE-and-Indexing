<ABSTRACT>
Any shapes of leads (L) formed on various types of drums (10) may be measured 
without employing an exclusively-used profiling plane by a lead shape measuring 

apparatus (700). The lead shape measuring apparatus (700) includes a shape measuring 
unit (190) for measuring a shape of a lead (L) formed on a drum (10) used in a VTR while a 

theoretical value suitable to this lead shape is varied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for measuring a lead of a work, for
example, a drum used to record a signal on a tape and/or to reproduce the signal from
the tape, on which the lead is fabricated.Recently, there has been available approximately 100 sorts of drums involving
the drums for VTRs (video tape recorders) for consumers as well as VTRs for business
use.As to the drums, there has been proposed a lead measuring method for
measuring the shape of the lead fabricated on the drum (e.g., the lower drum) on the
basis of this drum per se, and also the lead measuring method for measuring the shape
of the lead on the basis of the rotation shaft of the drum which has been assembled with
respect to the rotation shaft of the drum. In addition thereto, the theoretical values for
the variation amounts (π x drum diameter "D" x tan lead "") of the respective lead
shapes are different from each other with regard to 100 sorts of drums, so that the
positions along the upper and lower direction would be changed.Under such circumstances, every time the measuring method is changed and
also the sort of drums to be measured is changed, the exclusively-used measuring
machines should be manufactured in order to measure such different shapes of the leads
formed on the drums.There is another problem in case of manufacturing of such an exclusively-used
measuring machine that this measuring machine should possess either an exclusively-used
copying (profiling) plane, or an exclusively-used copying (profiling) means. The
copying plane, or means, has a shape approximated to, for example, the theoretical
value of the lead's shape.A hob tester for measuring the profile of a helical external thread provided on a
workpiece is disclosed in an article entitled "The New Hob Tester, Model PCD-50 HB",
published on pages 57 to 61 of "Microtecnic", No. 3, October 1982, Zurich,
Switzerland. The end of a feeler arm mounted on a slide carriage rests on the external 
thread of the workpiece which may rotate about its axis. The movements of the
workpiece and of the slide carriage are periodically halted so that measurements can be
made of the rotational position of the workpiece and of the position of the feeler arm.WO-A-90/12277 describes an apparatus for measuring the profile of a wide
variety of objects, such as the profile of a helical external thread provided on a
workpiece which is rotatable about its axis. A feeler portion of a sensor rests on the
external thread and detects the profile of the thread at each new rotational

<CLAIMS>
A drum lead measuring method wherein:

a theoretical value of a shape of a lead (L) is previously prepared and a
measuring port (23) which is moved over a trace approximated to the theoretical value

of the lead shape, is in contact with the lead (L) to measure the shape of said lead,
thereby obtaining an actual moving amount of said measuring port while said

measuring port is travelled over the trace approximated to the theoretical value;
a difference between the actual moving amount of the measuring port and the
trace approximated to the theoretical value of the shape of the lead is calculated; and
only the shape of the lead is extracted based on said difference and said shape of
the lead measured by said measuring port.
A drum lead measuring method as claimed in claim 1, wherein both the shape of
said lead and the actual moving amount of said measuring port are measured along a

direction (B) parallel to a central shaft (100) of said drum (10).
A drum lead measuring method as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, which is
applied to a drum (10) having a lead (L) for guiding a tape and used to record a signal

on the tape and/or reproduce the signal from the tape, said drum being chosen among a
plurality of drums of different sorts, wherein the information of the theoretical value

related to the shape of said lead (L) is chosen in accordance with the sort of said drum
(10).
