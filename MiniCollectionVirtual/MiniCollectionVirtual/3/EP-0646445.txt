<ABSTRACT>
Scrap related to plastic waste, especially expanded polystyrene, undergoes reprocessing in an apparatus in which it is simultaneously subjected to specific friction, shearing forces and heat to comminute and compact it and also control its temperature and/or dry it and/or deaerate it. The material treated in the apparatus (1), a mixing recycler, leaves the apparatus as highly compacted pourable granules and the treated material has an apparent density many times higher than the untreated initial product. The granules compacted in a pourable state are well suited for further processing, because they have been produced with low thermal loading.
