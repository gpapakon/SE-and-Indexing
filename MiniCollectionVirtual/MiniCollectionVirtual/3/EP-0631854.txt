<ABSTRACT>
A cutting board assembly for cutting and/or 
trimming paper sheets, the assembly including a cutting 

board (12), a rail assembly (14) pivotally mounted on said cutting 
board (12) for movement between operative and inoperative 

positions, a carriage assembly (16) mounted on the rail 
assembly (14) for movement across the cutting board (12), a 

circular cutting blade (18) mounted in the carriage assembly (16) 
which is biased to an inoperative position on the rail 

assembly (14), a self-healing pad (22) mounted on the cutting board (12) 
in the path of travel of the cutting blade (18) whereby the 

carriage assembly (16) is pushed downward on the rail assembly (14) 
to move the cutting blade (18) to an operative position with 

respect to the self-healing pad (22) for trimming or cutting 
the paper sheets.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to paper cutting devices
and more particularly to a cutting board having a cutting
blade carriage assembly mounted for translational
movement on a rail assembly mounted on the cutting board
to facilitate the cutting and trimming of sheet material.Cutting boards of the type contemplated here
are shown in U.S. Patent No. 2,327,223, entitled "Sheet
Trimmer," issued to C. Silver, on August 17, 1943, U.S.
Patent No. 2,753,938, entitled "Dispenser and Cutter For
Rolled Paper and The Like," issued to E. R. Thiess on
July 10, 1956, and U.S. Patent No. 3,821,915, entitled
"Fiber Cutting Apparatus With Self-Contained Blade
Sharpener," issued to W. T. Larrable on July 2, 1974. In
each of these patents a cutter blade, either rotary or
stationery, is mounted in a housing that is pushed or
driven across the cutting board to cut various materials.
In each of these patents a slot is provided in the
cutting board to accommodate the cutting blade. The
patents to Thiess '938 and Larrable '915 are concerned 
with cutting strips of rolled material. Silver '223 is
concerned with a sheet trimmer which has a stationary
knife mounted on the edge of the cutting board that is
engaged by a knife rotated by a pinion gear as it is
pushed past a set of gear teeth formed on a guide shaft.US-A-5,069,097 discloses a paper-cutting machine
having a board which is provided at one end thereof with a
rail support for supporting a rail. One end of the rail is
pivotally supported by the rail support through a pin. The
other end of the rail is movable up and down about the
pin. A slider is movably provided on the rail and a
rotatable cutter blade is attached to the slider
in such manner, that it is movable in a direction perpendicular
to the longitudinal direction of the rail.
A paper
holder is resiliently supported on the reverse side of the
rail through a spring.GB-A-856,192 discloses a machine for
perforating, slitting, creasing and like operations on a
sheet of paper or cardboard. The machine has a bed to
receive the sheet or sheets, a hardened strip lengthwise
of the bed, a perforating or like wheel mounted in a
carrier that is movable along a round rod mounted in the
lengthwise direction of the strip, said clamping bar being
spring-urged clear of said strip. The clamping is effected
solely by operation of the carrier with automatic release
of the sheet or sheets when the pressure is removed from
the carrier on completion of the operation.The present invention relates to a cutting board
assembly as claimed in claim
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cutting board assembly (10) for cutting
or trimming paper sheets, said assembly comprising a

cutting board (12), a rail assembly (14) including a
hollow rectangular rail (24) and a pair of posts (26, 26

and 108, 116), the posts being fixed to opposite
longitudinal ends of the hollow rail (24) for supporting

the rail on the cutting board (12), at least one (26,
108) of the posts being pivotally connected to a pivot

block (27, 110) mounted on the cutting board (12), the
arrangement being such that the rail assembly is

pivotable between a first position in which paper can be
placed on the cutting board, and a second position in

which the hollow rail is in parallel relation to the
cutting board (12) and in which the paper is pressed

between the rail assembly and the cutting board, a
carriage assembly (16) guided on the rail assembly for

translational movement both across the cutting board as
well as in a direction perpendicular to the plane defined

by the cutting board between an operative position
proximal to the cutting board and an inoperative position

distant from the cutting board, and a circular cutting
blade (18) mounted for rotary motion in said carriage

assembly (16), characterized by a longitudinally
extending opening on one side of the rail, and by a pair

of leaf springs (48) formed on said carriage assembly
(16), the springs being positioned inside the rail (24)

for supporting the carriage assembly on the rail assembly

while biasing the carriage assembly to the inoperative
position on the rail whereby the carriage assembly must

be moved from the inoperative position to the operative
position with respect to the rail in order to allow for

cutting or trimming the paper sheets. 
The cutting board assembly according to
claim 1 including a self-healing pad (22) mounted on the

board in the path of the blade (18). 
The cutting board assembly according to
claim 1 including a cover (36) mounted on the trolley

(34) for supporting the cutting blade (18) on the
trolley.
The cutting board assembly according to
claim 3 including a self-healing pad (22) embedded in

said cutting board.
The cutting board assembly according to
claim 1 wherein said circular cutting blade (18) is

removably mounted on said cover whereby cutting blades
having different cutting edges may be mounted on said

cover.
