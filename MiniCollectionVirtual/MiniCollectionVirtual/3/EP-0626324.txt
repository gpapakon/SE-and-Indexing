<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveyor provided with a frame and with 
at least one moving means (2) which can be moved in its longitudinal 

direction 
by driving means. Carriers (8) extending transversely to the direction 

of 
movement of the moving means are coupled to the moving means (2). At 

least 
a few of the carriers support sliding pieces (11), which can be moved 

along 
the respective carriers by guide means, so as to move objects to be 

conveyed by the conveyor during operation. A carrier (8) is coupled to a 
moving means (2) near its centre, which moving means is built up of 

links (3,4), 
which are pivotable with respect to each other about pivot pins crossing 

or intersecting each other at least substantially perpendicularly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conveyor provided with a frame
and with at least one moving means which can be moved in its
longitudinal direction by driving means, to which carriers extending
transversely to the direction of movement of the moving means are
coupled as described in the pre-characterising part of claim 1.Devices of this kind are for example known from US-A-3,361,247
and FR-A-2,388,737.The carriers of these known devices are secured at their
ends to two endless moving means extending parallel to each other,
whereby the active carriers constitute the upper part of an endless
chain and the non-active carriers constitute a return part of an
endless chain, which is located under said upper part. Consequently
only some of the carriers can be used effectively for conveying the
objects, whilst the other non-active carriers move back under the
active carriers towards the starting point of the conveyor.According to the invention the conveyor is characterised as
described in the characterising part of the claim 1.By using the construction according to the invention an
effective conveyor is obtained, whereby all the carriers can be moved
along the entire path of movement of the moving means with their
active surface turned upwards, whilst it is also possible to move the
carriers from a higher level to a lower level and vice versa, so that
the number of applications of the device according to the invention
has been considerably increased in comparison with the device
according to the aforesaid patents. It is thereby possible to
discharge objects from the conveyor in more places than with the
aforesaid known conveyor while using the same number of carriers and
the same length of the moving means.It is noted that a conveyor comprising a moving means built
up of links, which are pivotable about horizontal and vertical pivot
pins with respect to each other, is known per se, for example from
FR-A-2304413 and Dutch Patent 
Application No. 8900974, but said Dutch Patent Application No. 8900974
relates to a type of conveyor different from the present invention.The invention will be explained in more detail hereafter
with reference to an embodiment of the construction according to the
invention diagrammatically illustrated in the accompanying Figures.Figure 1 is a diagrammatic, perspective view of a part of
a conveyor according to the invention.Figure 2 is a diagrammatic view of a carrier and a sliding
piece, which can be moved along said carrier.Figure 3 is a diagrammatic plan view of a switch station,

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor provided with a frame (1) and with at least one
moving means (2) which can be moved in its longitudinal direction by

driving means, to which carriers (8) extending transversely to the
direction of movement of the moving means (2) are coupled, whilst at

least a few of said carriers (8) support sliding pieces (11), which
can be moved along the respective carriers by guide means comprising

guide wheels (15, 25) connected to said sliding pieces (11), guide
rails (18, 19) and switch pieces (16, 17; 23; 27, 28) arranged in a

switch station, by means of which a guide wheel (15, 25) may be guided
in the direction of guide rails (18, 19) extending transversely to the

direction of movement of the moving means (2), so as to displace
objects to be conveyed by the conveyor during operation in a direction

transverse to the longitudinal direction of the moving means,
characterised in that each of said carriers (8) is coupled near its centre to a single

moving means (2) built up of
links (3, 4), which are pivotable with respect to each other about

pivot pins crossing or intersecting each other at least substantially
perpendicularly and a carrier (8) is connected to a link (3, 4) by

means of a connecting piece (7), whilst a guide wheel (15, 25), when
seen in a direction along a carrier (8) and perpendicular to the

longitudinal direction of the moving means (2), is disposed besides
said connecting piece (7).
A conveyor according to claim 1, characterised in that a
carrier (8) is wider near its centre (10) than near at least one end,

seen in the longitudinal direction of said moving means (2).
A conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
a switch piece (16, 17; 23; 27, 28) can be pivoted into and out of the

path of movement of a guide wheel (15, 25).
A conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that
a switch piece (16, 17) can slide into and out of the path of movement

of a guide wheel (15).
A conveyor according to any one of the preceding claims,
characterised in that two guide wheel (15) arranged side by side on 

either side of the connecting piece (7), seen in the direction of
movement of the moving means, are coupled to each sliding piece (11).
A conveyor according claim 5, characterised in that for

each guide wheel (15) there has been provided a switch piece (16, 17;
23) whereby each switch piece (16, 17; 23) can be actuated

independently of the other switch piece (16, 17; 23).
A conveyor according to any one of the preceding claims
1-4, characterised in that a guide wheel (25) is coupled to a sliding

piece, said guide wheel (25) projecting beyond the connecting piece
(7) on both sides, seen in the direction of movement of the moving

means (2).
