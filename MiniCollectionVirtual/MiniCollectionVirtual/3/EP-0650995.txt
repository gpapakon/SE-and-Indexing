<ABSTRACT>
In the process for the continuous preparation of polymers containing recurring succinyl units, maleic anhydride or a derivative thereof as starting material A and ammonia or an ammonia-releasing compound or amides of carbonic acid as starting material B are mixed with one another and reacted in a first exothermic reaction step to give an N-containing, low-molecular-weight derivative of maleic acid. This derivative is then polymerised in a subsequent second reaction step. The reaction of the starting materials (A and B) in the first reaction step takes place substantially adiabatically. The heat of reaction liberated during this reaction is utilised to bring the reaction mixture to the polymerisation temperature and to polymerise, at least partially, the N-containing, low-molecular-weight derivative in the second reaction step to give a polymer containing recurring succinyl units.

maleic anhydride or a derivative thereof (starting
material A) is mixed together with ammonia, an

ammonia-releasing compound or amides of carbonic
