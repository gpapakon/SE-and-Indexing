<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing functionalized monomer/polymer, the process 
comprising reacting a monomer/polymer having an acetoacetate group with a 

compound having a primary amine and at least one additional functional group, 
to produce the functionalized monomer/polymer wherein the additional 

functional group is attached to the monomer/polymer via an enamine formed 
by the acetoacetate and amine groups. 
Polymers of the present invention have many uses including coatings, 
sealants, adhesives and saturant applications, and are most useful as solutions or 

dispersions in water or water-cosolvent mixtures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the preparation of functionalized polymers,It is generally known to be useful to modify the properties of polymers by incorporating desired
functional groups of one sort or another into the polymer molecules. The desired functional groups
may be incorporated either by employing, as a monomer during the preparation of the polymer, a
compound which already has such functional groups, or by post-reacting the polymer having precursor
groups with suitable reagents to convert to the desired functional groups.EP 0 442 653 A2 discloses a process for the production of a polymer having desired groups,
denoted as Y, by reacting a polymer having carbon or nitrogen-bound -NH2 and/or -NH2- precursor
groups, which groups are reactable with enolic carboxyl groups, with at least one compound having a
single enolic carboxyl group and at least one Y, wherein by an enolic carbonyl group is meant a
carboxyl group having enolic character by virtue of being bonded to an alpha methylene or methane
group which is itself bonded to an electron withdrawing group.EP 0 483 583 A2 discloses that polyacetoacetates or polyacetoaceteamides can be reacted with
amino group-containing alkoxy-silanes to give polyenamines which permit a long processing time and
which crosslink without the action of atmospheric humidity. This is alleged to be an advantage for
film thickness greater than 50 Âµm.The aim of the present invention is to provide a new advantageous process for incorporating a
desired functional group into a polymer.In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for producing a
functionalized polymer, the process comprising reacting an aqueous dispersion or emulsion of an
acetoacetate functional polymer with a compound having a single primary amine and at least one
additional functional group, which compound is of the formula R2NH2 wherein R2 is a linking group
bearing a functional group and wherein the linking group is a divalent group selected from the group
consisting of C2 to C18 alkyl, alkoxy and polyalkoxyl chains having a molecular weight of from 72 to
400,000, and wherein said additional functional group is a mercaptan group, an alkoxy silane group, an
olefinic group, a secondary amine group, or an adhesion promoting group to produce the functionalized
polymer, wherein the additional functional group is attached to the polymer via an enamine group
formed by the acetoacetate and primary amine groups. The additional functional group may be incompatible with
polymerization
