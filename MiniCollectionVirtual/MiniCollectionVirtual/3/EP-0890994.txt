<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to integrated circuits and to
the fabrication of such circuits, with particular reference to the
fabrication of low defect DMOSFET structures.Power MOSFET devices enjoy widespread use in
such applications as automobile electrical systems, power
supplies, and power management applications. Many such
devices are commercially available, but an illustrative
device is product number SMP60N05, available from
Siliconix Incorporated, Santa Clara, California. This
device is an N-channel enhancement mode transistor
packaged in a TO-220AB case. The technology used to
fabricate the SMP60N05 product is characterized by a
specific on-resistance of 3.5 micro-ohms/cm2.Many different processes have been used for the
fabrication of power MOSFET devices over the years. These
are generally deep diffusion processes. For example, in
one early process disclosed in Great Britain Patent
Application Publication No. 2 033 658 A, published May 21,
1980 and naming Lidow et al. as coinventors, a p+ tub
region is about 4 microns deep and a p+ body region is
about 3 microns deep. The cell configuration is
hexagonal.The technology used to fabricate the SMP60N05
product typically achieves junction depths range from 2.5
to 5 microns for the body, from 5 to 6 microns for the p+ 
body contact, and from 0.5 to 1 micron for the n+ source
regions. The cell configuration is square.The present invention facilitates the
realization of a reduced rDS(on) and a higher MOSFET cell
density, which promotes more efficient load management
switching and allows the use of smaller or no heat sinks.
In another respect, the present invention facilitates the
realization of a lower gate charge for the same specified
on-resistance of earlier devices, which allows the use of
small drive circuits and fewer components.These and other advantages are variously
realized in different embodiments of the present
invention. In one embodiment, a method for initially
oxidizing a silicon body with steam for forming a power
MOS device, gettering is performed with 1 - 6 percent TCA
at 1000 - 1250 degrees C. In another embodiment directed
to forming thin gate oxide of a power MOS device,
gettering is performed with 0.5 - 5 percent TCA at a
temperature in the range of 900 - 1100 degrees C. In
another embodiment directed to forming a p- body diffusion
in a power MOS device, gettering is performed with 0.5 - 5
percent TCA at a temperature in the range of 900 - 1200
degrees C. In another embodiment, a heavily doped p+
region of less than 2.5 micron
