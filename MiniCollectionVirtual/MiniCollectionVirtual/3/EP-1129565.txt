<DESCRIPTION>
 A METHOD FOR STORING AND FORWARDING VOICE AND FACSIMILE MESSAGES USING AN E-MAIL PLATFORMFIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONToday, PTT's offer voice boxes as a service. One of the major producers of such a system is Comverse Technology Inc. The voice box is illustrated with reference to the block diagram illustration of Fig. 1 , shows a message storing system, generally designated 10. When a caller 12 dials the receiver's telephone number 18 and does not receive an answer, the PBX 14, linking the user with the PSTN, routes the call to the receiver's voice box 16, digitizes the message and stores it on a hard disk. Messages can be retrieved later by the receiver 18 contacting the dedicated voice box 16, generally stored at the PTT site.The implementation of such systems is far from being trivial since PTT's, which deal with millions of customers need to provide a service in real time. For example, if one calls from city A to city B and does not receive an answer, he should immediately be connected to the hard disk which contains the allocated space of the receiver. Since the number of hard disks is huge (one per telephone line), this task requires special hardware and software that is not easy to make. Moreover, in order to leave a message for a person in a city B one has to call city B, in spite of the fact that if the line of the receiver in city B is busy, the PBX knows that it is busy without calling city B. In addition, leaving a message for a person in City B costs exactly the same as calling city B.Another form of Internet Telephony messaging available today is the sending of facsimiles (fax) to an email address. Such a service is provided by 

Efax, of Palo Alto, California, which provides registered subscribers or members with a personal fax number, as described on their web site (http//:www.efax.com).Each personal fax number is associated with an email address of the member.Fax messages which are sent to the personal fax number of the member are converted by "efax.com" into a format readable by email and then sent to the member in email format.The fax to email service also requires the supplier to provide .a large storage capacity for the messages being received as well as telephone lines for each personal fax number. Furthermore, the personal fax number is generally located in the code area of the supplier and thus persons sending messages who are outside the dialing area, will need to make a long distance or international call to send the fax.At present, telephony messaging via PSTN or the
