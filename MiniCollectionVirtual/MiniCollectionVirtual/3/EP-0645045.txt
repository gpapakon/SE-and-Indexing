<ABSTRACT>
A CD storage and loading cassette is made from a limited number of components most or all of which are formed by moulding. The moulded components are a tray (2), a slide cover (4), a magnetically permeable puck (8) and a lid (10), in addition to which there may be used a coil spring (6). The cassette is compatible with existing industry standard CD Readers, and its novel design permits the manufacturing and assembly costs to be substantially reduced over the corresponding costs for conventional cassettes. The cassette may be made with planar top and bottom faces to receive the maximum amount of printed information relevant to the data stored on the CD contained in the cassette.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a storage and loading cassette for 
optical compact discs (CDs). Such cassettes can be used for 
storing a CD and, on insertion into a laser disc reader, 
presenting the CD to the disc drive and reading head of the 
disc reader without removal of the CD from the cassette. Optical CDs, originally available only as CD ROMs, are a 
valuable storage medium for optically encoded digital 
information which can be randomly accessed by a laser reading 
head. They permit rapid access to vast amounts of 
pre-recorded information and are useful in a wide variety of 
computer-related applications including video games, computer 
databases and audio, video and audio-visual recordings. One 
advantage which CD ROMs have in the data retrieval field is 
that they cannot be over-written, so that they provide a 
security of recorded data as well as a vastly increased 
storage capacity, as compared with magnetic floppy discs for 
computer use. A more recent entry into the field of optical 
CDs is an erasible-rewritable CD which has all of the 
attributes of vast data storage, which is characteristic of a 
CD ROM, but the additional facility of the ability to erase 
or overwrite recorded data. One characteristic of a CD reader, or a CD reader/writer 
(hereinafter referred to simply as a CD Reader) for serious 
commercial use as opposed to domestic hi-fi music systems, is 
that the disc may be loaded into the CD Reader while 
contained in a cassette. The cassette acts as a storage case 
or storage for the disc while the disc is out of the CD 
Reader, but enables the disc to be accessed and read (data 
access) while in the CD Reader.  
 There are two alternative types of storage and loading 
cassette currently available. In one type, the optical disc 
remains in the cassette during data access, with the laser 
reading head accessing the disc through a radial slot in the 
cassette. The slot is covered by a slide cover when the 
cassette is removed from the CD Reader. In the other type, 
the CD Reader includes a pincer mechanism for grasping the 
disc by its edges, withdrawing it from the cassette and 
placing it on a turntable, all automatically on loading the 
cassette into the CD Reader. The reverse sequence takes 
place automatically prior to ejection of the disc in its 
cassette from the CD Reader. The present invention is 
concerned with the former type of CD storage and loading 
cassette only. One such design of cassette is currently 
marketed under licence from Sony Corporation under the Trade 
M

<CLAIMS>
A CD storage and loading cassette comprising: 

a tray (2) for receiving an optical compact disc, 
including a radial slot (26) extending from an outer 

periphery of a compact disc received in the tray to a 
central drive hole of the compact disc for access of the 

whole surface of the disc by an optical reading head; 
a lid (10) covering the tray; 
a slide cover (4) located inside the cassette 
between the tray and the lid, comprising a shutter blade 

(20) covering the whole of the slot when the cassette is 
removed from a CD Reader and being automatically slidable 

to an open position at one side of the slot on loading 
the cassette into the CD Reader, 
characterized in that the tray includes supports 
(17) moulded thereon for engagement with an outer 

peripheral edge of a compact disc received in the tray to 
define a rest position for the disc, and the slide cover 

further comprises an integrally moulded guide portion 
(22) at one end of the shutter blade, slidable on a 

linear guide rail (14) in the tray, and a parallel guide 
portion at an opposite end of the shutter blade and at an 

opposite side of the central drive hole of any compact 
disc received in the tray, received beneath a guide 

portion (18) of the tray to hold the shutter blade in a 
plane between the tray and the disc rest position and to 

guide the shutter blade for linear sliding motion in that 
plane. 
A CD cassette according to claim 1, wherein the 
supports (17) moulded on the tray define a minimum 

spacing between a CD received in the tray and a bottom 
inner surface (12) of the tray, and the moulded shutter 

blade (20) blade portion of the slide cover is of a 
thickness less than the said minimum spacing.  

 
A CD cassette according to claim 1 or claim 2, 
wherein the slide cover (4) is injection-moulded in one 

piece. 
A CD cassette according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the said opposite end of the shutter blade (20) 

is slidably received beneath an overhanging projection 
(18) upstanding from the inside of the tray. 
A CD cassette according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the slide cover (4) is slidable to one side only 

of the radial slot (26), to define its open position. 
A CD cassette according to any preceding claim, 
wherein the slide cover (4) is spring-biased towards its 

rest position. 
A CD cassette according to claim 6, wherein the 
spring bias is provided by a coil spring (6) having its 

opposite ends anchored to the slide cover (4) and the 
tray (2) respectively. 
A CD cassette according to claim 7, wherein the 
moulded guide portion (22) of the slide cover comprises 

an open channel portion (36) defined between two walls, 
the guide rail (14) of the tray comprises one wall of an 

interfitting open channel portion and the spring (6) is 
located in the innermost of the two open channel 

portions. 
A CD cassette according to claim 6, wherein the 
spring bias is provided by an integrally moulded coiled 

portion (46) of the slide cover (4), the coiled portion 
having a natural resilience to assume the tightly coiled 

state in which state it holds the slide cover in its rest 
position.
