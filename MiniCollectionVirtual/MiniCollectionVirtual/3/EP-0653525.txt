<ABSTRACT>
A portable accommodation unit (1O), which is of 
particular value for a custody building within which 

prisoners or other persons may be confined, comprises a 
secure, generally box-shaped, load-bearing inner 

structure (11), an outer wall (13) and a layer of heat-insulating 
material (12, 16) disposed between said 

inner wall structure (11) and said outer wall (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a portable 
accommodation unit, which is of particular value 
for a custody building within which to confine prisoners 
or other persons but which may also be used for 
other accommodation purposes. Custody buildings in the form of prisons or 
cell blocks almost invariably take the form of permanent 
structures built of conventional building materials 
on pre-designated sites and therefore afford very 
little or no flexibility in their use. This lack 
of flexibility in use is a serious limitation which 
leads to significant difficulties in practice, as 
will be explained. The prison population in Western society tends 
to vary in cycles over the years and also to increase 
progressively, with the result that often the available 
prison capacity is insufficient, either for a short 
period or on a longer-term basis. On such occasions, 
any overcrowding in the available accommodation 
may readily give rise to a deterioration in living  
 
standards therein. On other occasions, routine 
work carried out for maintenance, refurbishment 
or modernisation of existing accommodation reduces 
the amount of accommodation available and again 
can lead to local or regional overcrowding. Furthermore 
conventional prison accommodation is usually unable 
to cope with short-term, short-notice demands arising 
from national or international emergencies. For the foregoing reasons, it would be desirable 
to provide temporary, for example portable, accommodation 
suitable for increasing the capacity of a 
prison or other such institution quickly for at 
least a limited period. Unfortunately, available 
temporary accommodation units, which may be suitable 
for housing members of the general population for 
a limited period in an emergency or for a longer 
period, are wholly unsuitable for confining prisoners 
in that they afford no security against escape, 
especially by a determined individual. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide a portable accommodation unit by which some 
at least of these disadvantages of existing units 
are overcome and in particular which is suitable 
for use for confining prisoners. The portable accommodation unit according to 
the present invention comprises a secure, generally  
 
box-shaped, load-bearing inner structure, an outer 
wall and a layer of heat-insulating material disposed 
between said inner structure and said outer wall. The unit of the present invention differs 
fundamentally from most prior portable buildings 
in that its main
