<ABSTRACT>
Burner for gaseous fuel with adjustable fuel 
flow, comprising a mixing chamber (2) for mixing the fuel with 

an oxidation gas, a combustion chamber (3) for burning the gas 
mixture formed in the mixing chamber and a dividing wall (1) 

between mixing chamber and combustion chamber, the said 
dividing wall being provided with a burner deck (4) and with 

throughgoing channels (7) for conveyance of the gas mixture 
from the mixing chamber to the burner deck, wherein the 

channels all begin in one and the same plane on the side 
of the dividing wall which faces the mixing chamber and 

end in one and the same plane on the side of the dividing 
wall which faces the combustion chamber, each channel 

having a travel time for sound waves and there being at 
least one channel with a shortest travel time and at 

least one channel with a longest travel time different 
from the shortest travel time, the travel times being 

spread between the longest and the shortest travel time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a burner for gaseous
fuel with adjustable fuel flow, comprising a mixing
chamber for mixing the fuel with an oxidation gas, a
combustion chamber for burning the gas mixture formed in
the mixing chamber and a dividing wall between mixing
chamber and combustion chamber, the said dividing wall
being provided with a burner deck and with throughgoing
channels for conveyance of the gas mixture from the mixing
chamber to the burner deck.The burning of the gas mixture causes acoustic
vibrations, which, in the case of the customary burner
designs, are amplified and can lead to resonance in the
burner system. From DE-A-4014217 a burner of the type
described in the opening paragraph is known in which means
are used to avoid resonance of the burner. The occurrence
of resonance is avoided by ensuring that the frequencies
at which individual flames of the burner can resonate are
different. In particular this is achieved by placing the
flow openings in an irregular pattern or by providing the
openings with a collar having different dimensions.The flames on the various openings thus have not
only their own resonance frequency but also their own
combustion behaviour.Consequently, when the burner is modulated, some
parts of the burner will already be able to enter the
optimum range whilst other parts have not yet done so.
This can restrict the modulation depth of the burner to an
undesirable degree.The object of the invention is to provide a
burner of the type specified in the opening paragraph in
which these disadvantages are avoided. This object is achieved according to the
invention in that the channels all begin in one and the
same plane on the side of the dividing wall which faces
the mixing chamber and end in one and the same plane on
the side of the dividing wall which faces the combustion
chamber, each channel having a travel time for sound waves
and there being at least one channel with a shortest
travel time and at least one channel with a longest
travel time different from the shortest travel time, the
travel times being spread between the longest and the
shortest travel time.The differences in travel time result in phase
differences in the resonances in the individual channels.
These mutual phase differences prevent positive
interference between the resonances of the individual
channels and destructive interference even occurs with the
result that the resonances damp each other. This provides
a considerable reduction in the noise level generated in
the burner. This favourable effect

Burner according to claim 2 in which the difference
between the longest and the shortest travel time at

least approximately corresponds with one period of a
resonating sound wave generated in the burner.
Burner according to claim 1, in which channels have
different lengths to cause their difference in travel

times.
Burner according to claim 2, with the difference in

length between the channel with the longest travel
time and the channel with the shortest travel time

being between 1/4 and 1/2 of the wavelength of a
sound wave generated in the burner.

characterized in that channels that differ in length

also differ in cross-section.
