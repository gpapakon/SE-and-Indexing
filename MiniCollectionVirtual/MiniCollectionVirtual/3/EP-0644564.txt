<ABSTRACT>
A control panel includes controllers in the form of 
push buttons (20) supported by an elastomeric switch pad 

(34) over an electroluminescent lamp panel (52). The 
electroluminescent panel (52) includes circuits (58, 60, 62) 

formed by chargeable areas (56) which register with optical 
indicia (28, 30) carried by the buttons (20) and transmitted 

through openings in the elastomeric layer (34). The 
elastomeric layer (34) includes pads which resiliently urge 

the buttons (20) to a rest position at which contacts (46) 
carried by the elastomeric pad (34) are spaced apart from 

terminal conductors (92) on a printed wiring board (94). A 
peripheral (38) wall of the pad formed with the elastomeric 

layer (34) is supported by a tactile membrane (40) which 
permits depression of the button (20) to engage the contact 

(46) against the terminal conductors (92) of the printed 
wiring board (94), and returning the button (20) to the rest 

position. The control panel (10) controls that operate in 
response to audio system operating modes, for example, the 

controls related to a cassette player, can be identified by 
different colour or intensity of light depending on the 

drive circuits applied to the chargeable areas (56) formed 
on the electroluminescent lamp panel (52).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
illumination of indicia on a control panel and, more 
particularly, to audio system bezels for motor vehicles 
having illuminated optical indicia on controls of the audio 
system. Control panels often have background illumination in 
order to expose graphics or optical indicia that identify 
the functions related to particular controls on the control 
panel. The traditional choice for illuminating control 
panel graphics located above, on or below a button or switch 
actuator, particularly in motor vehicle audio entertainment 
systems, has been an arrangement of incandescent lamps and 
light pipes, for example, as shown in U.S. Patent No. 
4,449,024. A light pipe may be formed as a transparent or 
translucent panel but must be specially constructed with 
reflecting baffle surfaces and the like to direct light rays 
in particular directions at various distances and locations 
from an incandescent light source. Thus the substantial 
engineering, design and implementation of the light pipe 
requires a long lead time, particularly with a complex light 
path arrangement for audio system control bezels. 
Accordingly, such structures were correspondingly expensive. 
However, they do not offer a balance of light colour and 
intensity throughout the light pipe and they provide little 
or no differentiation of button actuator function graphics. 
For example, the illumination is unable to distinguish the 
operable controls of an audio system bezel or control panel 
during operation of a radio receiver from the operable 
controls and other functions during operation of a cassette 
tape player or a compact disc player once a different 
operating mode has been selected on the control panel. 
Furthermore, the light reflective surfaces arranged to 
reflect light toward a push button face after travelling 
transversely behind the buttons through the light pipe  
 
introduce illumination losses that interfere with 
identification of indicia, distinction between the indicia, 
and a user's selection of desired control. Other known lighting structures include background 
illumination for translucent or clear button grids where a 
light source provides background lighting for indicia in the 
button. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,138,119 and 
5,149,923 to Demeo disclose tactile dome switches with an 
illumination diode positioned beneath each dome. In other 
instances, the illumination is provided by an 
electroluminescent panel providing back lighting for the 
indicia.

An illuminated control panel comprising: 

a bezel panel (16) having a plurality of openings (18); 
at least one button (20) received in one of the openings 
(18); 
at least one of the bezel panel (16) and the at least one 
button (20) having optical indicia (28, 30); 
an elastomeric layer (34) beneath the button (20) and the 
bezel panel (16), said layer (34) resiliently maintaining the 

button in the opening (18) and having at least one contact 
element (46) registering with the button and carried on the 

surface opposite the button; 
an electroluminescent lamp panel (52) beneath the 
elastomeric layer (34); and
