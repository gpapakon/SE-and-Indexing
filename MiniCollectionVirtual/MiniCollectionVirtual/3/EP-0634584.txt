<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a hydrodynamic retarder with the following features:   a casing which can be filled with a working fluid and also emptied;    a rotor blade wheel which has a number ZR of blades;   with a stator blade wheel which has a number ZS of blades;   with a profile outside diameter DA;   with a profile inside diameter DI.   The invention is characterised by the following features: the number ZR of blades on the rotor is 1.2 to 1.5 times the number ZS of blades on the stator, preferably 1.35 times.
