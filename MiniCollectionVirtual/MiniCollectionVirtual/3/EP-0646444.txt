Concrete mixer hood intended to protect the
electric drive motor, characterized in that it comprises

at its lower part a sealed passage in the form
of a chicane which opens to the electric motor (3), and

in its upper part superimposed ducts (4
g
 and 4
t
), one
(4
g
) of which is in communication with the interior
space of the hood, and the other (4
t
) of which is able
to receive water coming from the outside, the said two

ducts being connected to the outside by means of a
leaktight double chicane (4
y
) so as to create a more or
less vertical draft for cooling the said motor.
Hood according to Claim 1, characterized in
that it comprises two vertical and parallel walls

(4
a
, 4
b
) joined together by front and rear faces (4
c

and 4
d
), a bottom (4
e
) secured to the rear face (4
d
)
while its free edge has a vertical cheek (4
f
) which,
with the front face (4
c
) defines an empty space, a
gutter (4
g
) shaped into the lower part of the front
face (4
c
) for wrapping round the vertical cheek (4
f
) so
as to form a chicane-shaped passage, a first lid
 (4
l
)
mounted to slide inside the walls (4
a
, 4
b
) comprising a
ventilation duct (4
g
), a second lid (4
m
) which covers
the first (4
l
) to form another leaktight duct (4
t
) and
a double chicane (4
y
) consisting of a vertical wall
(4
j
) secured to the front face (4
c
) into which the
ducts (4
g
 and 4
t
) open.
Hood according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the rear face (4
d
) is secured to a vertical upright
(5
a
) of the chassis (5) by means of a spacer 
piece (6) on which there is an O-ring seal (6
b
) which
is compressed by a washer (6
c
) and a circlip (6
d
) so
that the attachment is sealed against outside water.
Hood according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the vertical walls (4
a
 and 4
b
) comprise, at their
upper parts, edges (4
r
) turned towards the inside of
the hood (4) to form slideways in which the edges (4
z
)
of the first lid (4
l
) slide, so as to form a connection
which is sealed against outside water.
Hood according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the lid (4
l
) comprises two superimposed and
parallel plates (4
m
, 4
p
) of different lengths for
delimiting the ventilation duct (4
g
).
Hood according to Claim 5, characterized in
that one of the edges which are free and perpendicular

to the walls (4
a
, 4
b
) of the plate (4
p
) bears against
an inclined plane (4
k
) secured to the vertical wall
(4
j
).
Hood according to Claim 5, characterized in
that one of the edges which are free and perpendicular

to the walls (4
a
, 4
b
) of the plate (4
n
) is in abutment
against the rear face (4
d
), whereas the opposite edge
stops just above that of the plate (4
p
) in the region
of the inclined plane (4
k
).
Hood according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the double chicane (4
y
) comprises horizontal
deflectors (4
u
) secured to the face (4
c
) and to the
wall (4
j
).
Hood according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the bottom of the gutter (4
g
) is pierced with a
hole (4
h
) for removing the water.
