<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing natural rubber, which 
comprises drying and compounding one or more viscosity 

stabilizers for natural rubber comprising hydrazide 
compounds of the following general formula, 


R-CONHNH₂
where R is selected from alkyl groups having 1 to 30 
carbon atoms, cycloalkyl groups having 3 to 30 carbon 

atoms, and aryl groups. 
Preferred methods for manufacturing natural rubber 
comprise treating under drying conditions to result in 

10% or less of the difference of gel content and 85% or 
more of molecular weight retention between before and 

after drying; and treating with a strainer after 
compounding hydrazide stearate into the natural rubber. 
Gelation (storage hardening) is suppressed and a 
decrease in molecular weight is prevented, by means of 

the invention.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a manufacturing method of natural rubber which imparts a good
processability and excellent physical properties.In general, natural rubber is produced in tropical
countries such as the Kingdom of Thailand, Malaysia, and
The republic of Indonesia. Natural rubber is used widely
in the rubber industry, the tire industry and
the like due to its excellent physical properties.Immediately after natural rubber is produced, Mooney
viscosity of the natural rubber is as low as 60 ∼ 70.
However, during several months when natural rubber is
transported to Japan for example, the Mooney viscosity thereof
increases up to nearly 90 ∼ 100, that is gelation takes 
place ( so-called "storage hardening").As a cause of storage hardening, it is believed that
crosslinking is formed by the reaction of different kinds
of bonds ( an aldehyde group and the like ) in an isoprene
chain with protein and amino acids in natural rubber and
then gelation takes place ( the mechanism has not been
determined clearly yet in the literature).The gelation in natural rubber ( an increase in the
amount of gel ) deteriorates processability. In general,
natural rubber having a high molecular weight is preferable
from a consideration of physical properties, and a
decrease in molecular weight affects the physical properties
of natural rubber.Molecular weight and amount of gel are greatly
influenced by rubber coagulation from natural rubber latex,
storage of natural rubber and drying conditions after
water-washing.As drying conditions in processes for producing
natural rubber, there are two typical methods as follows.
One is ribbed smoked sheet (RSS) graded by Type
Description and Packing Specifications for Natural Rubber
Grade Used in International Trade (so-called "Green Book"),
and the other is technically specified rubber (TSR).
According to RSS, smoking is carried out at around 60 °C
for 5 ∼ 7 days, and in accordance with TSR, hot air-drying 
is carried out at around 120 °C for several hours.However, there is a problem that the drying conditions
at the time of manufacturing RSS promote the gelation of
natural rubber. Also, there is a problem that the drying
conditions at the time of manufacturing TSR lower the
molecular weight of natural rubber. In addition, since in
both RSS and TSR the viscosity thereof increases by
gelation during storage ( storage hardening ), there is a
problem that mastication causing a decrease in molecular
weight is needed.Most natural rubber is usually manufactured in the
order of tapping
