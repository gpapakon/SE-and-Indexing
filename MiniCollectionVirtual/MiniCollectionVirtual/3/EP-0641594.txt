<ABSTRACT>
A oil- and water-repellent filter which contains a porous filter material that 
has its internal and external surfaces coated with a compound formed by 

combining a fluoropolymer having a fluorine-containing aliphatic cyclic 
structure in the main chain and a fluoropolymer containing polyfluoroalkyl 

groups. The coating imparts superior oil- and water-repellency without 
impairment to the flow of air or other gases through the filter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas-permeable filter which has both
oil- and water-repellent characteristics. More particularly, the invention relates
to gas filters and vents in which a porous material of the filter is coated with a
compound of fluoropolymers which imparts oil- and water-repellent properties
to the porous material.As a result of improvements in materials and technology, and the current
trend towards miniaturization and portability, electronic and mechanical
devices for personal and industrial use are becoming sensitive to an
increasing number of materials that can adversely affect their performance
and are increasingly being installed, or carried into, and used in environments
which contain such materials.When possible, such devices are contained in sealed enclosures and
are not exposed to the ambient environment. However, in most cases, it is
desirable for the enclosures and housings containing sensitive mechanical or
electronic equipment to have openings that permit easy passage of gases,
such as air, through them. This may be desirable for transmission of sound,
for example, in the case of cordless telephones, transceiver radios, pagers,
loudspeakers, and the like; or for the purpose of accomodating or controlling
changes in temperature and pressure in devices such as modern cameras
with auto-focussing or zoom lenses, computers, analytical instruments,
automobile electronic controls, pressure sensors and pressure switches, and
the like.In these cases it is necessary to protect the sensitive components of the
devices from contact with harmful elements present in the ambient
environment. This is usually done by installation of a filter in the vents, or
openings, in the enclosure to serve as a barrier to harmful particulates, liquids,
or aerosols present in most environments. Porous membranes of hydrophobic
materials such as polytetrafluoroethylene or other fluoropolymers, or polyolefin
polymers, have been used as vent filter materials, and are well known in the 
art Also, other synthetic polymers in the form of woven or non-woven fabrics,
mesh, netting, or felts treated with water-repellent coatings have been used as
water-repellent gas-permeable filter materials. Filters containing these
materials can provide good barrier properties against passage of particles,
water, or water mist. However, such materials generally lack oil-repellency
and, when contacted by oils, may become plugged or blinded so that gas-permeability
is lost; or if contacted with many water-soluble oils,
