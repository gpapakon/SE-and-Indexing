<ABSTRACT>
Manganese dry cells sorted out of used-up dry cells are 
crushed and sieved to obtain a mixture composed predominantly 

of anodic substances, which is in turn used for ferrite 
production. The invention is preferable for a saving of 

resources and preservation of the environment, and enables 
ferrites on a practical-enough level to be obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for recycling used-up 
dry cells, especially manganese dry cells, and a process for 
producing soft ferrite by making use of such used-up dry cells. With recent reductions in the size and weight of 
electrical appliances and a current wide distribution of 
portable types, there is an increase in the quantitative 
proportion of dry cells used. Most of dry cells used as 
primary cells are of manganese and alkali-manganese types, and 
are now often discarded with domestic waste after use. In some 
cases, these used-up dry cells are incinerated as by municipal 
corporations together with domestic waste. Alternatively, they 
are collected in the form of garbage, and thereafter disposed 
by collectors, etc. For the disposal of the thus collected used-up dry cells, 
various proposals have been made from the recent viewpoint of 
preservation of the environment, a saving of resources and 
reductions in the volume of waste. For instance, there are 
processes for classifying or dismantling them or processes for 
separating valuable materials from them, as set forth in JP-A  
 
60-136174, JP-A 61-488, JP-A-61-78484, JP-A 61-97085, JP-A 61-118182, 
JP-A 61-23498, JP-A 62-145658, JP-A 62-286584, JP-A 4-65063, 
JP-B 4-22975, JP-B 3-31116, JP-B 63-2676, JP-B 3-6208, 
JP-B 3-48624, JP-B 2-47059, JP-B 63-25830, JP-B 52-7813, JP-A 
50-1094, JP-A 61-11191, JP-A 60-156594, JP-A 60-211023, etc. However, although all these publications suggest that the 
material obtained from used-up dry cells like manganese dry 
cells may be recycled as the raw material for preparing 
magnetic materials such as manganese dioxide or ferrites, they 
make no illustrative reference to the obtaining of materials 
such as ferrites. This is because the prior process cost much 
due to consumption of much energy; that is, their low cost-effectiveness 
hinders the progress of recycling and collecting 
techniques. Thus, current rates of recovering and recycling 
used-up dry cells remains still very low. Under such situations, it is expected that if material of 
high value added can be obtained from used-up dry cells, the 
rate of recovering them will then increase spontaneously. This 
is also preferable in view of preservation of the environment, 
a saving of resources, and reductions in the volume of waste. 
Thus, there is a strong demand for the effective recycling of 
used-up dry cells. A primary object of the invention is to achieve a saving 
of resources and preservation of the environment by recycling 
used-up
