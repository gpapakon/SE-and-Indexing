<ABSTRACT>
In order to save energy in the main drive of upsetting presses, the proposal is to arrange in the feed circuit of the hydraulic press cylinder a pressure-medium accumulator which is charged during the return stroke of the press and helps to drive the press tool during its advance.

Method of operating the press tools (3), which are provided with 
hydraulic reduction drives, of upsetting presses (1) for stock to be 

rolled, wherein the cylinders (4, 5) of the hydraulic reduction drives 
are incorporated in a hydraulic circuit which comprises a working pump (7 

to 7''') and to which a pressure storage device (9) is connected in 
parallel, characterised thereby that the return strokes of the reduction 

drives, which together with the working pumps (7 to 7''') and return 
stroke cylinders (5, 5') form a substantially closed hydraulic circuit, 

are effected by the working pumps (7 to 7'''), wherein the pressure 
medium expelled from the press cylinders (4) of the reduction drive is 

taken over into the pressure medium storage device (8), and that the 
pressure medium from the pressure medium storage device (8) works in 

parallel to the working pumps (7 to 7''') for the forward strokes at 
least until contact of the press tools (3) with the stock to be rolled. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised by a regulation of the 
synchronism between the two hydraulic reduction drives. 
Upsetting press (1) for reduction of the width of stock to be rolled, 
wherein press tools (3) arranged at both sides of the stock to be rolled 

each have hydraulic reduction drives, which effect a movement of the 
press tools (3) substantially towards or away from one another, the 

upsetting press (1) in a given case comprises advancing drives (6) which 
are able to drive the press tools (3) in direction of advance of the 

stock to be rolled, and the cylinders (4, 5) of the hydraulic reduction 
drive are incorporated into a hydraulic circuit which comprises a working 

pump (7 to 7''') and to which a pressure storage device (9) is connected 
in parallel, characterised thereby that each reduction drive comprises at 

least one press cylinder (4) which is known in itself and which 
together with at least one working pump (7 to 7''') and at least one 

return stroke cylinder is connected into a substantially closed hydraulic 
circuit, and that a pressure medium storage device (8) provided in 

parallel to the working pump (7 to 7''') is connected with this and the 
press cylinder (4) by way of a valve, preferably a storage/metering valve 

(10).  
 
Upsetting press according to claim 3, characterised thereby that the 

effective pressure area of the pistons of the return stroke cylinders (5, 
5') is smaller than the effective pressure area of the pistons of the 

press cylinders (4). 
Upsetting press according to claim 4, characterised thereby that 
travel transmitters for pick-up of actual travel values are associated 

with the press tools (3), that the travel transmitter is connected with a 
regulating device (2) for synchronising regulation between the two press 

tools and that the regulating device (2) operates on a pump (16) for the 
synchronising regulation. 
Upsetting press according to claim 5, characterised thereby that the 
working pumps (7 to 7''') of the press cylinders (4) and the return 

stroke cylinders (5, 5') form a drive circuit, with which is associated 
at least one supply pump (15, 15') by way of which a pressure medium loss 

is compensated for and in a given case pressure medium needed for the 
circuit is supplied. 
Upsetting press according to claim 6, characterised thereby that the 
working pump (7 to 7''') in the advancing circuit (11) is connected in 

parallel with a pump metering valve (12), which is preferably controlled 
in dependence on pressure and by way of which pressure medium can be 

supplied to a cooler (13) and subsequently to a tank (14). 
Upsetting press according to claim 6, characterised thereby that 
adjustable hydraulic motors (18 to 18'''), the hydraulic connections of 

which lie in the advancing circuit (11) between the working pumps (7 to 
7''') and the press cylinder (4) and which on the other hand are 

connected with the tank (14) in a given case by way of a cooler (13), are 
coupled to the working pumps (7 to 7'''). 
Upsetting press according to at least one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised thereby that pumps adjustable beyond zero find use as 

working pumps (7 to 7''').
