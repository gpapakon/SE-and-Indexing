<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with improvements in and 
relating to rolls of paper supported on hollow 
cylindrical formers, especially rolls for domestic use 
such as rolls of toilet paper and rolls of kitchen 
paper. Many systems are known whereby an odoriferous 
material may be introduced into the atmosphere of a 
confined space, such as a toilet or kitchen. It is an 
object of the present invention to provide a roll of 
paper, supported upon a hollow cylindrical former, which 
roll, in use, is capable of displacing a fragrance or 
odour to the atmosphere surrounding it. Basically, the present invention provides a roll of 
paper wound up on a hollow cylindrical former, the inner 
surface of the former being coated with a coating 
containing rupturable microcapsules containing an 
odoriferous substance. In use, the roll of paper will 
be supported by a rod-like support passing through the 
centre of the hollow former and it has found that the 
mechanical interaction between the surface of the 
support rod and the coated inner surface of the former 
causes rupture of some of the microcapsules contained in  
 
the coating and, as a result, release of the fragrance 
or perfume contained therein to the atmosphere. The hollow cylindrical former, on which the paper is 
wound, will generally, as is conventional, be formed of 
cardboard but, of course, other materials, such as 
plastics materials, may be employed. The coating, 
comprising microencapsulated odoriferous material, is 
conveniently applied to the inner surface of the 
cylindrical format by spraying thereon a dispersion or 
slurry of microcapsules in a suitable vehicle, typically 
water. The suspension may have dissolved in the liquid 
carrier thereof a binding agent for promoting adhesion 
of the microcapsules to the former surface but in many 
cases the material of which the outer surface of the 
microcapsules is formed will of itself have adequate 
adhesive properties to secure adequate adhesion of the 
microcapsules to the surface. Thus, for example, one 
common class of microcapsule comprises, as wall 
materials, an inner wall of material (in contact with 
liquid contained in the microcapsule) of gelatin and and 
an outer wall formed of a gum such as gum arabic. The 
art of forming microcapsules containing organic liquids, 
such as organic or odoriferous materials, is of course 
well established and widely practised.  The microcapsules used in accordance with the 
present invention suitably have a mean particle size in 
the range 10 to 30
