<ABSTRACT>
A teeth cleaning element 10 for cleaning relatively 
large spaces in the teeth consists of from about 400 to 

about 800 filaments in an elongated bundle that is from 
about 1,200 to 2,400 about denier. The filaments at the 

mid-portion (11) of the length of the bundle are 
textured with the crimps and crinkles of the texturing 

of the several filaments being intermingled and in 
contact at numerous points and being adhered together at 

the contact points to form a bulky, longitudinal, 
longitudinally and laterally resilient mass. The 

filaments at the opposite end portions 12, 13 of the 
bundle that extend from the bulky mid-portion are 

adhered together in compact, smooth parallel relation 
for threading between the teeth.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a string like element for
cleaning relatively large spaces in teeth, such as the
spaces in teeth which include bridges, implants, braces,
orthodontic appliances or other conditions which may
create unusually large spaces in which particles of food
and dental plaque may become trapped and which cannot be
cleared and cleaned effectively with conventional dental
floss.The features defined in the preamble of claims 1 and 6,
respectively, are disclosed in US-A-4008727 incorporating
US-A-3896824.US-A-3,896,824 describes a string-like teeth cleaner
formed of bundled filaments in which the filaments in a
portion of the bundle are textured by having been
crimped and crinkled and the textured filament portions
are adhered together at various contact points to form
an elongated, laterally enlarged spongy or resilient
portion. The bundled filaments extending from the
respective ends of the enlarged, spongy portion are
adhered together in tight parallel relation to be slim
and smooth, like dental floss, so as to enable it to be
pressed down between teeth into the space between the
teeth at the gum line. The enlarged spongy portion is
intended to more nearly fill the space between teeth at
the gum line which is normally larger than the space 
between adjacent teeth at their crowns. In addition the
spongy enlarged portion is longitudinally and laterally
resilient so that when it is pulled longitudinally it
stretched into a thinner diameter so that it can be
introduced into relatively small spaces and then expand
slightly to fill that space when the tension is released
to let it return to its normal relaxed diameter.The cleaner of US-A-3896824 is formed of 200 to 300
filaments and is of small enough diameter for its thin
end portions to be inserted into the crevice between
teeth as dental floss and for its larger brush portion
to fill the spaces ordinarily occurring in teeth.
However, it has been found that for cleaning larger
spaces an encountered between implants or in braces, for
example, this cleaner is not too satisfactory. It's
brush portion is not large enough to work well in
unusually large spaces and it is not rugged enough to
withstand being severely stretch, abraded and compressed
when used in tight spaces. By using two or three of the
prior cleaners together enough bulk can be provided for
clearing and cleaning larger spaces, but they still can
not stand up to the added abrasion, compression and
stretching stresses encountered with bridges,
orthodontic appliances and the like. Due

<CLAIMS>
A teeth cleaning element for cleaning relatively
large spaces in teeth, comprising:


an elongated bundle of individual filaments in which
the filaments in a mid-portion (11) of the length of the

bundle are textured by being crimped and crinkled with
the crimps and crinkles of the respective filaments

being in contact with each other and adhered together at
their points of contact, forming a bulky, cohesive,

laterally and longitudinally resilient mass of the
textured filaments, and in which the filaments in the

end portions (12, 13) of the bundle extending outward
from the bulky mid-portion are adhered together in

compact, smooth, substantially parallel relation,
characterised in that said bundle comprises about 400 to

800 filaments and is of from about 1,200 to about 2,400
denier.
The teeth cleaning element of claim 1, characterised
in that the bundle is formed of at least about 600

filaments and is about 1,800 denier.
The teeth cleaning element of claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the filaments are man made

synthetic resins from the group consisting of nylon and
polyester. 
The teeth cleaning element of claim 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the filaments are adhered together

with a synthetic resin from the group consisting of
nylon and polyester.
The teeth cleaning element of claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the filaments are nylon and

adhered together with nylon resin.
A method of manufacturing a teeth cleaning element
as defined in claim 1, the method comprising coating a

yarn of textured filaments with a resin and stretching a
portion of the yarn to draw out the crimps and crinkles,

and drying the coated yarn to adhere together the
textured filaments in the unstretched portion to form

the mid-portion (11) of the teeth cleaning element, and
in the stretched portion to form an end portion (12, 13),

characterised by using a yarn comprising about 400 to 800
filaments and being of from about 1200 to about 2400 denier.
