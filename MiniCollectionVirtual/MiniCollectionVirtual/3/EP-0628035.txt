 RETROVIRAL PROTEASE INHIBITORSFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to retroviral protease inhibitor compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, and a method of treating retroviral diseases therewith, including a metho of treating disease states associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, HIV-2) .BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Retroviruses, that is, viruses within the family of Retroviridae, are a class of viruses which transport their genetic material as ribonucleic acid rather than deoxyribonucleic acid. Also known as RNA-tumor viruses, their presence has been associated with a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. They are believed to be the causative agents in pathological states associated with infection by Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) , murine leukemia virus (MLV) , mouse mammary tumor virus ( MTV) , feline leukemia virus (FeLV) , bovine leukemia virus (BLV) , Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV) , simian sarcoma virus (SSV) , simian acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (SAIDS) , human T- 

lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I, -II) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1, HIV-2) , which is the etiologic agent of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)and AIDS related complexes, and many others. Although the pathogens have, in many of these cases, been isolated, no effective method for treating this type of infection has been developed.Retroviral replication occurs only in host cells. Critical to this replication is the production of functional viral proteins. Protein synthesis is accomplished by translation of the appropriate open reading frames into polyprotein constructs, which are processed, at least in part, by a viral protease into the functional proteins. The proteolytic activity provided by the viral protease in processing the polyproteins cannot be provided by the host and is essential "to the life cycle of the retrovirus. In fact, it has been demonstrated that retroviruses which lack the protease or contain a mutated form of it, lack infectivity. See Katoh et al . , Virology, 145, 280-92(1985), Crawford, et al . , J. Virol . , 53, 899-907(1985) and Debouk, et al . , Proc . Natl . Acad. Sci . USA, 84, 8903-6(1987) .Inhibition of retroviral protease, therefore, presents a method of therapy for retroviral disease.The use of isosteric replacements has been disclosed as a strategy for the development of protease inhibitors for HIV-1.
