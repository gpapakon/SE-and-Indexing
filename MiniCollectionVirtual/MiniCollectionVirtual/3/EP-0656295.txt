<ABSTRACT>
A sealing device for rolled-up-fabric packages, in particular 
plastics packages, comprises a first substantially rigid 

clamping element (4) made of plastic material and adapted to 
partly encircle a sealing area of said one package, and a 

second clamping element (7) made of plastic material and 
adapted to be engaged with said first clamping element (4) 

according to a plurality of positions, so as to completely 
enclose said sealing area, said first and second clamping 

elements (4, 7) defining pre-shaped clamping surfaces (9a, 
9b) between which said sealing area is squashed, and said 

first and second clamping elements (4, 7) comprising means 
for mutual engagement by forced fitting (7a, 8) adapted to 

define an irremovable engagement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for sealing
packages of rolled-up fabrics, in particular plastics
packages.It is known that packing sheets, generally made of plastic
material, polyethylene for example, are currently wrapped
around fabric rolls.These packing sheets are clamped and locked to the rolled-up
position in many cases with the aid of clips or staples of
metal material.Said clips are bent upon themselves in the same manner as
common staples for holding paper sheets together.The staples are applied to the end portions of the packing
sheets which are disposed close to the ends of the rolls and
folded in a layered or pleated form.This known technique has the merit of being simple and cheap
and also of holding said end portions of the packing sheets
steadily, so that they practically form end bunches in the
rolls, which bunches are also very useful for grasping the
fabric rolls when they are arranged in a stack.In fact, when several rolls are arranged in a stack,
withdrawal of a single roll when it is not located uppermost
is possible only by making the same slide in a direction
parallel to its wrapping axis, and in this case the grasping
point enabling said withdrawal is exactly said end bunch.Beside the above advantages, this known technique also has
some drawbacks.In fact, due to the rules of law obliging to carry out a
differentiated disposal of refuse, metal staples need to be
separated from the packing sheets of plastic material before
sending the latter to the dump.Therefore a specific intervention on the staples is necessary
in order to separate them from the plastics sheets. This
operation is time-consuming and therefore increases costs.The increase in costs may have an important incidence if we
consider that, when a great number of rolls is to be handled,
which usually happens in some industries in the textile 
field, it is sometimes necessary to assign appropriate staff
to this operation of separating the different parts of the
packaging before getting rid of them.Another drawback is connected with the fact that the above
metal staples do not enable achievement of a hermetic seal of
the packages.In fact the application of said staples involves the steps of
bending them and turning their ends towards the central
portion of same and therefore, once said staples have been
bent, their profile is like that of a butterfly, that is the
staple ends are expanded due to the presence of curved loops
formed by said bending.Practically the known metal staples in use produce on the
layers they tighten

<CLAIMS>
A sealing device for packages (2) of rolled-up fabrics, in
particular for packages (2) of plastic material, comprising:


a substantially rigid first clamping element made of plastic
material and adapted to partly encircle a sealing area (3a) of

a respective one of said packages (2),
and a second clamping element of plastic material to be
engaged with said first clamping element according to a

plurality of positions, so as to completely enclose said
sealing area (3a);


said first and second clamping elements defining pre-shaped and
opposite clamping surfaces (9a, 9b) between which said sealing

area (3a) is squashed, and having means for mutual engagement
by forced fitting,
said first clamping element being a substantially U-shaped
staple element (4) defining, at the inside thereof, a

substantially smooth seat (4a), and having two side arms (6)
provided with toothed locking portions (8) disposed externally

of said seat (4a),
and said second clamping element being a plate (7) having a
pair of gauged holes (7a) sized to receive said arms (6) with

said toothed locking portions (8) and providing an irremovable
connection when said plate (7) is engaged with said staple

element (4),

characterised in that the teeth of said toothed locking
portions (8) have each a transverse face (8b) substantially

parallel to the central portion of said U-shaped staple element
(4),
and in that in the engaged position of said plate (7) with said
staple element (4) said transverse faces (8b) fixedly hook said

plate (7) externally of said gauged holes (7a), allowing an
outwardly-convex bending of the clamping surface (9b) of said

plate (7).
A device according to claim 1, wherein said gauged holes
(7a) have a smooth circular configuration. 
Use of a device according to claim 1 for sealing a package
of a rol
led-up fabric, wherein the package (2) is made of a
plastic material and wherein said U-shaped staple element (4)

and said plate (7) are made of the same plastic material as
that of said package (2).
