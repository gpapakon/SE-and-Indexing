<ABSTRACT>
A pump (10) has a pump body (11) which at least partly encloses a pair of opposing pump chambers (12) and (13). Mounted in the body (11) are a pair of flexible diaphragms (14 and 15) which divide the respective chambers (12 and 13) into sub-chambers (16, 17, 18 and 19). Extending between the diaphragms (14 and 15)  is a connecting rod (20) which is connected to each diaphragm (14 and 15) by a flange assembly (21). Located at each longitudinal end of the pump (10) are manifolds (22) which each provide an inlet duct (23) and an outlet duct (24). Each duct (23) and (24) has an associated valve assembly (25) which restricts movement of the pumped liquid in one direction through the pump (10). Also disclosed is a control valve (29) with a spool (30) having encircling grooves cooperating with detents consisting of O-rings located in corresponding internal grooves in the valve body, and a circular diaphragm having central, intermediate and peripheral portions interconnected by resilient annular hinges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pumps and more particularly but not exclusively to 
air operated pumps to move liquid, including liquid having suspended solids (sludge). 
The invention also pertains to a control valve and more particularly to a control 
valve in which the conventional ball and spring detent mechanism is replaced with a 
polymeric O-ring or rings. The invention also relates to diaphragms employed in air operated pumps to move 
liquids. Compressed air operated pumps are known to consist of reciprocating dual 
diaphragms located within a metal pump body. The pump chambers are serviced by cast 
metal manifolds. The overall weight of these previously known pumps is considerable 
which is of a major disadvantage where the unit must be manhandled. This problem is 
exacerbated in cramped areas such as mines. Control valves such as spindle valves often include a positive locating device or 
detent mechanism. The locating device or detent mechanism positively orients the shaft 
or spindle of the valve with respect to the sleeve or valve body. Prior art spindle valves 
tended to jam because the steel balls of the detent mechanisms were susceptible to wear, 
the wear pattern increasing the likelihood of jamming between the shaft and the sleeve or 
body of the valve. Compressed air operated pumps are known to consist of reciprocating dual 
diaphragms located within a metal pump body. The pump chambers are serviced by 
manifolds. For example, such a pump is described in USA patent 4,238,992. The pump described in the abovementioned USA patent suffers from the 
disadvantage that the diaphragms fail at an unacceptably low number of cycles. It is the object of the present invention to overcome or substantially ameliorate at 
least one of the above disadvantages. There is disclosed herein a pump diaphragm (210) formed of resilient material and 
comprising: 
a central portion (216) for attachment to a piston; a peripheral portion (217) for attachment to a housing generally surrounding the 
piston; an intermediate portion (219) defining a frusto-conical plane, the intermediate 
portion (219) extending between the central portion (216) and the peripheral portion 
(217); said diaphragm comprising  
 first hinge means (221) merging the intermediate portion (219) with the central 
portion (216) and second hinge means (220) merging the intermediate portion (219) with 
the peripheral portion (217), each hinge means (220,221) comprising an annular 
protuberance extending out of the frusto-conical plane of the
