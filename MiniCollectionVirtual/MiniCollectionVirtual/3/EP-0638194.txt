<ABSTRACT>
Stationary speed-measurement devices used in traffic control have sensors laid in the road surface which react to vehicles that pass over them and which generate speed measurement values; when an admissible speed limit is exceeded by a vehicle driving over the sensors, a picture of the vehicle is taken by a camera. In order to test the operatability of such speed measurement devices, error recognition means prevent the speed measurement values from being taken into account when certain error criteria occur. Counters are provided for counting the frequency of occurrence of error criteria. A determined statistical distribution of the occurrences of the various error criteria results for each installation. When deviations from this distribution are detected, that means that the installation needs to be modified.
