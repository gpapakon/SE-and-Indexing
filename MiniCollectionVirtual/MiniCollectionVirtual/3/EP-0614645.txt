<ABSTRACT>
An optical CT apparatus in which the speed 
of scanning an object with light is increased for efficient 

measurement. In the present invention, a beam 
of light guided from light sources (15-1, 15-2) 

through a single optical fiber (12-5c) is introduced 
into one of optical fibers (12-1) of a fiber bundle 

through an image inversion optical system comprising 
a trapezoidal prism (13-1) and two lenses (14-2, 

14-1). When the trapezoidal prism (13-1) is turned 
on its optical axis, the beam of light from the optical 

fiber (12-5c) is sequentially introduced into different 
optical fibers (12-1), so that an object (11) to be 

measured is scanned with the beam. The beam 
transmitting through different parts of the object 

(11) returns through the corresponding fibers to the 
image inversion 
optical system, and then it is introduced 
into the corresponding optical fibers (12-4) of 

a fiber bundle and is detected by optical detectors 
(16-2a, 16-2b, ...).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved optical 
computed tomography equipment. More particularly, the 
invention relates to an improved method for irradiating 
light to a test subject. Computed tomography (CT) equipment has gained widespread 
acceptance as medical equipment. The CT 
equipment comes in various types: X-ray CT, nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) CT, positron CT and ultrasonic 
wave CT. The most recent version of the equipment is 
optical CT equipment that utilizes visible or near 
infrared light. The optical CT equipment operates on the so-called 
back projection method for image reconstitution. To use 
this method requires procuring projection data which is 
obtained as follows: a light beam is first irradiated to 
various points on the test subject to measure the 
intensity of the transmitted light from the subject in 
diverse directions. The measurements are used to find  
 
the light transmittance of the subject at the respective 
irradiation points. To acquire the projection data 
further involves having the irradiation position of 
light scan a number of points along the periphery of the 
subject under test; at each of the irradiation points, 
the light transmittance of the subject must be measured 
in various directions. The conventional scanning methods for irradiating 
the light beam to the test subject are typically shown 
in Figs. 2 and 3. The method of Fig. 2 is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 115548/1988. This method 
involves retaining a light source 21 and a photo 
detector 22 within the same gantry 23 that is rotated 
around the test subject 20. The rotation of the gantry 
23 changes the irradiation position of light and the 
detecting position of the transmitted light. The method 
of Fig. 3 is disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 
56411/1989. According to this method, a light beam 
guided from the light source 31 via an optical fiber 32 
is made to scan a test subject 30. The scanning is 
accomplished by use of an optical scanner 33 comprising 
a wobbling mirror 33a. The light transmitted through 
the subject 30 is detected by a photo detector array 34 
having numerous photo detectors arranged therein. The  
 
individual photo detectors in the photo detector array 
34 are switched electrically to vary that point on the 
subject at which to measure the transmitted light. Another conventional method is illustrated in Fig. 
4. This method, disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
No. 72542/1985, employs optical fibers 43 and 44 in 
switching between two
