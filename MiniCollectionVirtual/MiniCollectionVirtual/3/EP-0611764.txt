<ABSTRACT>
A method for preparing an aromatic ether bisimide 
is provided. The mixture obtained from reacting a 

substituted phthalimide, shown below, with a metal salt of a hydroxy 
aromatic compound in a non-polar solvent is extracted 

with about 4% to about 6% by weight aqueous alkali 
hydroxide solution to remove the reaction's by-products 

and thus provide substantially pure aromatic ether 
bisimide. The method is particularly suitable for 

extracting aromatic ether bisimide by-products from a 
continuous process preparing aromatic ether bisimide, 


wherein R¹ is hydrogen, an alkyl radical having from 1 to 8 carbon 
atoms or an aryl radical having from 6 to 13 carbon atoms and X¹ is a 

nitro or halo radical.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to improved
extractions which provide better removal of extraneous
materials or by-products produced while preparing
aromatic ether bisimides and thus increasing the yield
of the desired bisimide product. The invention also
relates to extractions of by-products from continuous
processes of preparing aromatic ether bisimides.EP-A-0,119,576 discloses a method for making
aromatic ether imides comprising effecting the
displacement of reactive radicals on a phthalimide
nucleus with a mono- or bis-alkali metal phenoxide in the
presence of a nonpolar solvent and a phase transfer
catalyst, such as a triorganoborate. The aromatic ether
imides are useful intermediates for making aromatic ether
anhydrides and aromatic his (ether anhydrides).EP-A-0,141,692 discloses bis-quaternary ammonium and
phosphonium salts such as bis(tri-n-butyl)-1,6-hexylenediammonium
dibromide are excellent phase transfer
agents for the preparation of aromatic ether imides, as
by the reaction of the disodium salt of bisphenol A with
4-nitro-N-methylphthalimide.EP-A-0,273,159 discloses the synthesis of aromatic
his (ether phthalimide) compounds by reacting a
phthalimide with a stoichiometric excess of an alkali
metal diphenoxide salt in the presence of a catalytic
amount of a phase transfer catalyst, in an anhydrous
nonpolar organic solvent under ether-forming conditions.
Impurities are removed by solid-liquid separation
techniques, such as filtering at a temperature at which
the bis(ether phthalimide) is substantially completely
soluble while alkali metal salt impurities are
substantially insoluble. The product is subsequently
recovered from the filtrate in high yields and at high
purity. Aromatic ether bisimides are useful as chemical
intermediates in the production of a number of
important compounds. For example, 2,2-bis[4-(N-methylphthalimide-4-oxyphenyl]propane
(hereinafter
"bisphenol A-bisimide" or "BPA-BI") is used in the
preparation of polyetherimides which are commercially
important thermoplastics. In certain processes
aromatic ether bisimides are prepared from an alkali
metal salt of a hydroxyaromatic compound which
undergoes a nucleophilic displacement reaction with a
substituted phthalimide. See, for example, U.S. Patent
4,520,204. The displacement reaction is usually
effected in a relatively non-polar organic diluent such 
as benzene, toluene, xylene, chlorobenzene,
tetrahydrofuran, octane, acetonitrile or the like in
the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, typically a
tetraalkylammonium salt.
