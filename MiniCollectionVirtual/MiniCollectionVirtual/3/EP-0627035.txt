Device for protecting buildings against the 
ingress of harmful gases, in particular radon, from the 

ground, a barrier system which consists of a plurality of 
horizontal layers being constructed in the floor between 

the ground and the interior of the building and being 
laterally bounded in particular by vertical walls of the 

building, the barrier system having horizontal boundary 
layers 
made of a plastic material, characterized in that 
a barrier layer (12; 24) forming a continuous barrier 

with the barrier system in the floor (1) is arranged in 
the vertical wall (2), this barrier layer (12; 24) being 

made of a material which inhibits the rising of hazardous 
gases, in particular radon, and is introduced via bores 

(13; 22) which are arranged in a row in the wall (2) and 
end in the area of the horizontally arranged barrier 

system in the floor (1), and in that, to connect the 
barrier layer (12; 24) in the wall (2) to the barrier 

system of the floor (1), a slot (21) accommodating the 
boundary layers (6) of the same projects with the latter 

into the barrier layer (12; 24) and is closed by a 
filling material. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the barrier layer (12; 24) in the wall (2) is made 

of a synthetic resin. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the barrier layer (12; 24) in the wall (2) is made 

of a wax, preferably a paraffin. 
Device according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the barrier layer (12; 24) is arranged in a  

 
vertical wall (2) consisting of masonry (10) formed from 

hollow chamber blocks (10â€²). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the barrier layer (12; 24) is arranged in a vertical 

wall (2) made of a material (25) containing a large 
number of pores, such as lightweight concrete. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, at a joint in the barrier system of the floor (1), 

across which joint a wall (2) is arranged, the barrier 
layer (12; 24) extends above the joint over the entire 

width of the wall (2). 
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that vent bores (19) are arranged in one 

or more layers in the wall (2) above the barrier layer, 
which vent bores (19) are connected to the outer atmosphere. 
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the vent bores (19) lead into a duct (15) which is 

connected to the outer atmosphere via one or more openings 
(17), there being a positive pressure or a vacuum in 

the duct (15) relative to the ambient pressure. 
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the duct (15) is arranged between the outside of an 

outer wall of the building and a heat-insulating layer 
(16) applied to said outer wall. 
Device according to one or more of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that an insulating layer (7) extending 

upwards from the floor (1) and completely or partly 
covering the wall (2) is arranged on the sides of the 

wall (2) which are located in the interior of the building.
