<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to people moving devices in 
general, and to balustrades therefor in particular. Escalators, moving walkways, and other people 
moving devices efficiently move a large volume of 
pedestrian traffic from one point to another. 
Passengers step on moving steps (or belts, or pallets) 
and are transported along at a constant rate of speed. 
For safety reasons, passenger handrails are provided, 
travelling in the same direction and speed as the steps. 
A balustrade assembly supports and guides one of the 
handrails on each side of the steps. Each balustrade assembly includes balustrade panels 
(typically glass) which extend up from a base to support 
the handrail. Externally, the base consists of a number 
of enclosure panels including an outer decking, an outer 
cladding, an inner profile, and a skirt panel. The 
outer decking and outer cladding enclose the mechanics 
on the side of the balustrade panel opposite the moving 
steps. The inner profile and skirt panel enclose the 
mechanics adjacent the moving steps. Within the base, the balustrade panel is supported 
by a panel holder fixed to a bracket welded to the 
frame-of the escalator. A clamping means clamps the 
balustrade panels within the panel holder(s). 
Typically, the clamping means also clamps a trim piece 
against the panel. On one side of the panel, the trim 
piece accepts and supports the edge of the outer 
decking, and on the other side, the trim piece accepts 
and supports the edge of the inner profile. The outer 
decking and inner profile panels are also supported by 
brackets or clips fixed to the frame or to the panel 
holder. In addition to supporting the handrail, the  
 
balustrade assemblies also give the escalator its 
aesthetic appearance. The shape and composition of the 
balustrade assembly is carefully chosen to provide an 
aesthetic appeal. Paramount to this appeal is the 
appearance of quality. PassengerS want to ride a 
quality escalator. Thus, it is highly desirable to 
ensure that all balustrade and base panels align 
properly. It is known in the art to have individual 
panel holders or extruded panel holder sections which 
may be adjusted to achieve the alignment desired. 
specifically, most designs either use the means for 
clamping the balustrade panel as the means for adjusting 
the height of the panel, or the position of the panel 
holder itself is adjusted to achieve the desired panel 
height. There are two problems with these approaches. 
First, adjusting a panel holder to align the balustrade

<CLAIMS>
A balustrade for an escalator or the like, 
comprising: 


a balustrade panel (12); 
a panel holder (24) having a length and 
incorporating a glass channel (26), for attaching said 

balustrade panel to a structure; 
a clamp (30) for clamping said balustrade panel 
within said glass channel; and 
means (32 etc) for adjusting the vertical position 
of said balustrade panel, independent of said clamp. 
A balustrade according to claim 1, wherein said 
adjusting means (32 etc) further comprises: 


an arm (32); and 
means (34 etc) for attaching said arm to said panel 
holder (24), wherein said arm extends into said glass 

channel (26) under said balustrade panel (12), thereby 
supporting said panel at a specific position independent 

of said clamp (30). 
A balustrade according to claim 2, wherein said 
attaching means further comprises a threaded fastener 

(34). 
A balustrade according to claim 2, wherein said 
adjusting means (32 etc) further comprises a shim (36) 

for spacing said arm (32) relative to said panel holder 
(24). 
A balustrade according to any of claims 2 to 4, 
wherein said attachment means (34 etc) and said panel 

holder (24) form a mating male and female pair which 
enable said arm to be attached at any position along 

said length of said panel holder.  
 
A balustrade according to claim 5, wherein said 
adjusting means (32 etc) further comprises means (34 

etc) for adjusting the position of said arm (32) 
relative to said panel holder (24). 
A method of adjusting the height of a balustrade 
panel (12) in a balustrade assembly, comprising the 

steps of: 

providing a panel holder (24) having a length and 
incorporating a glass channel (26), for attaching the 

balustrade panel to a structure (22); 
providing a clamp (30) for clamping the balustrade 
panel within said glass channel; 
providing means (32 etc) for adjusting the vertical 
position of the balustrade panel, independent of said 

clamp; and 
adjusting the balustrade panel to a predetermined 
position with said adjusting means, independent of said 

clamp.
