<ABSTRACT>
A novel synthesis of 1,2-dioxetane phosphate alkali metal salts and novel intermediates employed in this synthesis are disclosed. A hydroxyaryl enol ether alkali metal salt having formula (1), wherein T can be an unsubstituted or substituted adamant-2'-ylidene group, R
<
3
>
 can be a methyl group, Y can be a phenyl group and M
<
+
>
 can be a sodium cation, is reacted with a phosphorohalidate to give the corresponding enol ether ethylene phosphate, which is then reacted with an alkali metal cyanide to give the corresponding enol ether cyanoethyl phosphate diester alkali metal salt intermediate. Singlet oxygen addition to this enol ether cyanoethyl phosphate diester alkali metal salt intermediate to give the corresponding 1,2-dioxetane cyanoethyl phosphate diester alkali metal salt, followed by  beta -elimination of the cyanoethyl group using an alkali metal hydroxide or the like, gives the corresponding 1,2-dioxetane phosphate alkali metal salt.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of
copending U.S. patent application Serial No. 559,152,
filed July 24, 1990, which in turn is a division of
copending U.S. patent application Serial No. 367,772,
filed July 17, 1989 (based on PCT application
PCT/US 89/00016, filed January 3, 1989 in the U.S.
Receiving Office based on Japanese patent application No.
185319/88, filed July 25, 1988, and now-abandoned U.S.
patent application serial No. 140,197, filed December 31,
1987); hence, Serial No. 367,772 is a continuation-in-part
of Serial No. 140,197. US-A-4 956 477, issued
September 11, 1990 as a division of Serial
No. 367,772, and copending
US-A-5 177 241 as a continuation
of US-A-4 956 477, are also included in this chain of
copending applications.The above-mentioned copending U.S. patent
applications
disclose and claim a new synthesis of stable, watersoluble
chemiluminescent 1,2-dioxetanes, particularly ones
that are enzymatically cleavable, substituted with
stabilizing and solubilizing groups and ring-containing
fluorophore moieties.Among the 1,2-dioxetanes that can be obtained by the
novel synthetic methods of this and the above-mentioned 
applications are those represented by the formula:

In this formula the symbol T represents a spiro-bonded
stabilizing group, a gem carbon atom of which is also the
3-carbon atom of the dioxetane ring.Also included among the 1,2-dioxetanes that can be
obtained using the novel synthetic methods of this and its
above-identified predecessor applications are the 3-(substituted
adamant-2'-ylidene)-1,2-dioxetanes described
in
CA-A-2 069 957.Among the stabilizing groups represented by T are
fused, substituted or unsubstituted polycycloalkylidene
groups, bonded to the 3-carbon atom of the dioxetane ring
through a spiro linkage and having two or more fused
rings, each ring having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms,
inclusive, e.g, an adamant-2-ylidene group. The fused
polycycloalkylidene group may additionally contain
unsaturated bonds or 1,2-fused aromatic rings, or X and X'
substituents as described hereinbelow.OR3 is an ether group, preferably a lower alkyl ether
group such as a methoxy group, in which the symbol R3
represents a C1-C20 unbranched or branched, substituted or
unsubstituted, saturated or unsaturated alkyl group, e.g.,
methyl, ethyl, allyl or isobutyl; a heteroaralkyl or
aralkyl (including ethylenically unsaturated aralkyl) 
group, e.g., benzyl or vinylbenzyl; a polynuclear (fused
ring) or heteropolynuclear aralkyl group which may be
further substituted, e.g.,
