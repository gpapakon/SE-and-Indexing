<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for the production
of acetic acid by carbonylation of methanol or a reactive derivative
thereof in the presence of an iridium catalyst and as promoter, at
least one of ruthenium and osmium.Carbonylation processes in the presence of iridium catalysts
are known and are described for example in US 3772380. UK patent GB
1276326 describes preparation of monocarboxylic acids and their
esters by carbonylation of alcohols, halides, ethers, esters or 1,2
epoxy aliphatic compounds in the presence of rhodium or iridium
catalysts, halogen promoters and water or an alcohol, ether or
ester.Carbonylation processes in the presence of ruthenium and
osmium catalysts are also known. Thus, UK patents GB 1234641 and GB
1234642 describe a process for the production of an organic acid or
an ester by carbonylation of an alcohol, halide, ester, ether or
phenol in the presence of a noble metal catalyst selected from
iridium, platinum, palladium, osmium and ruthenium and their
compounds and a promoter which is halogen or halogen compound.
According to Jenner et al in J.Mol. Catalysis 40 (1987) 71-82
ruthenium compounds are effective carbonylation catalyts for
converting primary alcohols into acids and esters at high CO
pressures. Standard conditions of 450 bar CO pressure were used in
the reported experiments and low CO pressures were said to lead to
high yields of hydrocarbons and a lower yield of ester. UK patent
application GB 2029409 describes a process for the preparation of 
aliphatic carboxylic acids and esters by reacting carbon monoxide
with alcohols at an elevated pressure of 34 atmospheres or greater
in the presence of a ruthenium catalyst and halogen-containing
promoter.US patent US 5268505 describes the preparation of adipic acid
by hydrocarboxylating a pentenic acid in the presence of rhodium
catalyst and a co-catalyst of at least one of iridium, ruthenium and
osmium.European patent publication EP 0031606-A describes a process
for the co-production of carboxylic acids and esters by reaction of
esters and/or ethers with carbon monoxide and hydrogen in the
presence of a catalyst system which comprises a ruthenium compound,
a Group II metal iodide and/or bromide or transition metal iodide
and/or bromide, and a further Group VIII metal compound. The Group
VIII metal is said to be especially rhodium and palladium. Only
these Group VIII metals are illustrated in the examples.According to European patent publications EP 0075335-A and EP
0075337-A the Group II or transition metal
