<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to boundary scan testing of electronic 
circuit networks having both individual digital integrated 
circuit chips and individual analog integrated circuit chips 
which are not testable by the digital testing methods. Modern 
boundary scan testing technology consists of digital testing 
techniques, such as the IEEE 1149.1 Standard boundary scan 
testing and Level Sensitive Scan Design testing, as well as 
other methodologies, especially those developed for analog 
devices. Generating test patterns for both types of boundary 
scan testing, that is, analog boundary scan testing and 
digital boundary scan testing, as when both types of 
integrated circuit chips are present in the same circuit 
network, that is, on the same printed circuit board or card, 
has heretofore been accomplished only through special custom 
test circuits, test fixtures, and test programming. According 
to the system and method of the invention described herein, 
commonly available hardware and software can be used to 
automatically test circuit networks with mixed digital and 
analog integrated circuit types. Boundary scan testing is described in many papers, including 
R.W. Bassett, M.E. Turner, J. H. Panner, P.S. Gillis, S.F. 
Oakland, and D.W. Stout, "Boundary Scan Design Principles for 
Efficient LSSD ASIC Testing," IBM Journal of Research and 
Development, Vol. 34, No. 2/3, March/May 1990, pp. 339-354.  Heretofore functional testing of printed circuit boards has 
been carried out by test fixtures that facilitated "bed of 
nails" contact of the individual integrated circuit leads. 
The development of high pin count devices and surface mount 
technology, with high populations of high I/O density, grid 
array components, frequently on both sides of a card or board, 
has made bed of nails testing prohibitively expensive. To 
allow bed of nails testing, surface mount packages must either 
sacrifice their high I/O advantage and chip density, or even 
more complex and costly testing fixtures must be used. Boundary scan testing provides an alternative to bed of nails 
testing. Boundary scan testing provides board signal node 
access while limiting in-circuit test fixturing. Boundary scan 
techniques replace the physical access points needed for in-circuit 
testing with equivalent logical access points. These 
equivalent logical access points are the boundary scan 
latches. The boundary scan latches correspond to the signal 
I/O pins of each component. The board testing applications of boundary scan methodology
