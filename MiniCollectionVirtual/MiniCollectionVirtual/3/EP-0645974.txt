<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a chair with an adjustable-inclination seat (6) pivotable in the forward region about a horizontal pivot axis (5) and a back (11) with an angle of inclination which can be altered over-proportionately in relation to that of the seat, in which the seat (6) is articulatedly connected to pivot levers (10), one end of which supports the back (11) and the other end of which pivots on the bearing block (2) of the chair frame. The pivot levers (10) are articulated on the seat (6) at a distance from its rear, and the sections of the pivot levers (10) pivoting on the bearing block (2) to the sections of the pivot levers adjacent the articulation axis (9) of the seat are at an obtuse angle in relation to the bearing surface. There is a return spring (15) to restore the seat surface and the squab automatically from the inoperative to the operative position when the weight is relieved.

A chair comprising a seat (6) which is pivotable in the front 
region about a horizontal pivot axis (5) and which is variable in 

inclination, and a backrest (11) which is compulsorily overproportionally 
variable in inclination in dependence on the variation in inclination of 

the seat, wherein the seat is hingedly connected to pivot levers (10) of 
which one ends carry the backrest and the other ends are rotatably mounted 

on the mounting support (2) of the chair frame, wherein the pivot levers 
are pivotally connected to the seat at a spacing from the rear end of the 

seat and the portions of the pivot levers, which are rotatably mounted on 
the mounting support, are at an angle which is obtuse towards the support 

surface, relative to the portions of the pivot levers adjoining the pivot 
mounting axis (9) of the seat, wherein there is provided a return spring 

(15) for automatically returning the seat surface (7) and the backrest 
from the rest position into the operative position upon relief of the load 

due to weight, characterised in that the pivot axis (12) of the pivot 
levers (10) is displaceable relative to the mounting support (2) and that 

the return spring (15) is arranged between the mounting support (2) and 
the portions (10a) of the pivot levers 
(10), which are rotatably mounted 
on the mounting support (2), and is variably adjustable in its position of 

installation with respect to the pivot mountings (4, 14) in such a way 
that the torque exerted by the spring force about the pivot axes is 

variable. 
A chair according to claim 1 characterised in that the return 
spring (15) is fixedly mounted by one end to the mounting support (2) and 

is arranged displaceably with the other end in a slot-shaped guide (17) of 
the pivot levers (10). 
A chair according to claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in that the 
return movement of the pivot levers (10) is limited by means of a 

restricting device (19, 20) in such a way that the pivot levers (10) 
cannot come into contact with the underside of the seat. 
A chair according to claim 3 characterised in that the restricting 
device is formed by a slot guide (20) which is arranged at the underside 

of the pivot lever mounting (8) and into which engages a pin-like element 
(19) arranged on the mounting support (2).
