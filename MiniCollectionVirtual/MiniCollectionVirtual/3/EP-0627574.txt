Rotary oscillation damper, consisting of a primary mass 
(1) at the drive side, revolving with a drive shaft (2), 

which primary mass is in engagement with planet pinions 
(13) held axially free in a revolving secondary mass (7) 

at the take-off side and forms, together with these 
planet pinions (13), gear wheel pumps for a liquid 

damping agent conducted in a closed propelling circuit, 
wherein the primary mass (1) and the secondary mass (7) 

form a sealed casing for the damping agent, and pressure 
channels (17) of the gear wheel pumps are connected to 

the suction chamber (16) via devices (18, 21, 22) for

flow and devices (23, 24) for reduction of pressure 
peaks,
 
characterized in that,
 
the planet pinions (13) are constructed as bevel gears 

disposed with their axis radially to the drive shaft 
(2), which diverge radially outwards from the drive 

shaft (2), which are seated without shaft journals in 
pockets (12) of a pinion cage (10) of the secondary mass 

(7) and cooperate with a bevel gear tooth system (14) of 
the primary mass (1). 
Rotary oscillation damper, consisting of a primary mass

which primary mass is in engagement with planet pinions 
(33) held axially free in a secondary mass (7) revolving 

at the take-off side, and forms, together with these 
planet pinions (33), gear wheel pumps for a liquid 

damping agent conducted in a closed propelling circuit,

n.the primary mass (1) and the secondary mass (7) 
form a sealed casing for the damping agent, and pressure 

channels (17) of the gear wheel pumps are connected to

a function of rotational speed. 
Rotary oscillation damper according to claim 4, 
characterized in that the control device (21, 22) that 

closes as a function of rotational speed consists of at 
least one overflow bore (21) in the partition wall (20)
