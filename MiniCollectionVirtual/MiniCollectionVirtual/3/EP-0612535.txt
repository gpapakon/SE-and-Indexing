<ABSTRACT>
Implantable infusion apparatus (10) comprising a rigid manifold (12) 
having 

opposite first and second surfaces and a pronounced outwardly projecting 
mesa (18) positioned at or near the center of said second surface away 

from the 
periphery thereof, said mesa having a central perpendicular axis. A 

collapsible fluid tight infusate chamber (46) is provided having a closed 
end 

and an open end. Means are provided for mounting the chamber open end 
in a fluid-tight manner to the manifold first surface opposite said mesa. 

A self-sealing inlet port (144) is provided in said manifold mesa, said 
inlet 

port being accessible from the manifold second surface at the top of said 
mesa. Fluid conduit means (132) extend between said inlet port and the 

interior of 
said chamber. A first outlet conduit (76) communicates between said 

manifold 
first surface inside said chamber and the manifold periphery.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an implantable infusion apparatus according to claim 1. It relates more particularly to an implantable self-powered infusate pump which is capable of dispensing a measured dose of infusate to a patient over the long term and which is refillable and rechargeable by transcutaneous injection.Implantable infusion apparatus of the general type with which we are concerned has been in use for a number of years to treat diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, certain types of cancer and other chronic diseases. Basically, the apparatus includes a housing which contains a collapsible infusate reservoir. An inlet port through a wall of the housing communicates with the interior of the reservoir and that passage is closed by a needle-penetrable septum mounted in the housing wall. An outlet passage from the reservoir containing a flow restrictor extends to the housing exterior where it is connected to the proximal end of a flexible catheter.In use, the apparatus is implanted at a selected location in the body so that the inlet septum is situated directly underneath the patient's skin and the distal end of the catheter is positioned at a selected infusion site. Infusate is delivered to the infusion site by forcing that fluid from the apparatus reservoir through the catheter to the infusion site. The flow restrictor in the reservoir outlet determines the flow rate from the reservoir. When the infusate reservoir becomes empty, it may be refilled by injecting fresh infusate through the apparatus' inlet septum. As noted previously, the inlet is accessible readily by transcutaneous injection using a hypodermic needle or cannula.In the infusion apparatus of interest here, infusate is expelled from the reservoir to the infusion site by collapsing the reservoir. This collapsing force is provided by a two-phase fluid which is situated in a fluid-tight space outside the reservoir. The fluid is both a liquid and a vapor at physiological temperatures, e.g. 37°C (98.6°F), and it exerts a positive and constant pressure over the full volume change of the reservoir. On the other hand, when the infusate reservoir is expanded upon being refilled with fresh infusate during the refilling process described above, the two phase fluid is compressed with a portion of it reverting to its liquid phase thereby recharging that vapor pressure power source. The construction and operation of implantable infusate apparatus and pumps of this general type are described in detail, for example, in US-A-3,731,681 and 3,951,147 and in
