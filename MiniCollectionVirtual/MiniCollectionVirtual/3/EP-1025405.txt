<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a heat insulated transport box (1) whose containing space is encompassed by space delimiting elements, i.e. a roof element (2), a floor element (3), side walls (4) and an end wall (22). Each space delimiting element is self-contained and comprises a core wall part (13-16) with a large surface area which consists generally of rigid foam, especially polyurethane, and which is bordered entirely or partially by side members consisting of fibre-reinforced plastic. The space delimiting elements are rigidly interconnected on connecting surfaces in the area of the side members. The inventive transport box can be closed with conventional doors.

A heat-insulated transport box, in particular a container, the box space of which is
surrounded by rectangular, large-area space boundary elements (2, 3, 4, 22) which are

essentially made of a material having low thermal conductivity, in particular rigid foam,
a respective space boundary element (2, 3, 4, 22) being self-supporting and having a

large-area wall centre (13, 14, 15, 16) which consists throughout of rigd foam and
which has edge beams (5 - 12), the respective space boundary elements (2, 3, 4, 22)

being securely connected to each other at contact surfaces in the area of the edge beams
(5-12),

which comprises that

the edge beams (5 - 12) are made of partially or completely fibre-reinforced plastic
material, in particular of carbon fibre-reinforced and/or glass fibre-reinforced plastic

material, and completely surround the respective wall centre (13, 14, 15, 16), and that
the edge beams (5, 8, 9) of the space boundary elements (2, 3, 4) forming the top, the

bottom and the side walls are securely connected to each other at the longitudinal edges
of the transport box (1) and form longitudinal supports, the ends of which are mounted

in comers of surrounding reinforcing frames (17, 18) which are provided at the ends of
the cuboid transport box (1) and which are not connected to each other.
A transport box according to claim 1, which comprises that the respective reinforcing
frame (17, 18) consists of steel or fibre-reinforced plastic material.
A transport box according to either claim 1 or claim 2, which comprises that the edge
beams (5 -12) are beam-shaped with a quadrangular cross-section.
A transport box according to any one of claims 1 to 3, which comprises that the
respective edge beam (5 -12) is made of a beam core (27), in particular of rigid foam,

and of a jacket (28) made of a fibre-reinforced plastic material, which jacket surrounds
the beam core (27).
A transport box according to any one of claims 1 to 4, which comprises that the
respective space boundary element (2, 3, 4, 22) has a sandwich structure.
A transport box according to claim 5, which comprises that the wall centre (13, 14, 15,
16) and the edge beams (5 -12) surrounding the wall centre form an inner layer of the

sandwich structure which is covered on both sides with an inner skin (29) in the interior
of the box and with an outer skin (30) on the outside of the box.
A transport box according to any one of claims 1 to 6, which comprises that tranverse
beams (31) running transversely to the longitudinal direction of the box are mounted at

the underside of the space boundary element (3) which forms the bottom.
A transport box according to claim 7, which comprises that the respective transverse
beam (31) has a beam core (32) which is surrounded by a fibre-reinforced plastic jacket

(33). 
A transport box according to any one of claims 1 to 8, which comprises that two
longitudinal supports (25) are provided at the underside of the space boundary

element (3) which forms the bottom, which supports are supported at their ends in the
two front end reinforcing frames (17, 18) and have a rigid foam core (34) which is

surrounded by a fibre-reinforced plastic jacket (35).
A transport box according to any one of claims 1 to 9, which comprises that the front
wall (22) is formed by a sandwich component, in particular by a thickness-symmetrical

sandwich component, the wall centre (16) of which is arranged between the respective
front edge beams (6, 7, 10) of the top, the bottom and the two side walls which form the

frame for the wall centre (16).
