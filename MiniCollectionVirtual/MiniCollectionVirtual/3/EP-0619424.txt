<ABSTRACT>
The engine has first and second intake ports (102, 
103) for one cylinder (combustion chamber) (104). 

The intake ports (102, 103) are formed in a cylinder 
head (101) and extend substantially parallel to each 

other. Downstream ends (107, 105) of the first and 
second ports (102, 103) open to a combustion chamber 

defined in the cylinder upon a compression stroke. 
The first intake port (102) is a helical port to 

generate and supply a first swirl into the combustion 
chamber (104). The second intake port (103) has a 

recess (109) in its wall near its downstream end 
(105) to reverse a flow direction of the air in the 

second intake port (103) so as to generate and supply 
a second swirl into the combustion chamber (104). 

The recess (109) in the second intake port (103) 
reverses the air flow direction before the intake air 

in the second intake port (103) enters the combustion 
chamber (104), so that the second swirl flows in the 

same direction as the first swirl in the combustion 

chamber (104). Therefore, a single strong swirl (S) 
is obtained in the combustion chamber (104).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine having 
first and second intake ports for each cylinder (or 
combustion chamber), and more particularly to 
improvements to intake ports of such an engine (see EP-A-281015). If a plurality of intake ports is formed for a single 
cylinder (or combustion chamber), an effective area 
for air intaking is enlarged in total and various 
advantages arise. Most typical engines having a 
plurality of intake ports are three-valve engines 
(two intake ports and one exhaust port) and four-valve 
engines (two intake ports and two exhaust 
ports). One example of the four-valve engine is disclosed in 
Japanese Patent Application, Publication No. 50-135421. 
Figure 21 of the accompanying drawings is 
one figure of this publication. As shown, two 
intake ports 1 and 2 extend parallel to each other 
and perpendicular to a direction of a crankshaft (not 
shown). The first intake port 1 is provided for 
inertia supercharging and the second intake port is  
 
provided for normal air intaking. The intake air 
entering the combustion chamber 4 from the first 
intake port 1 and that from the second intake port 2 
are different in speed and pressure. Thus, when 
these intake air streams enter a single combustion chamber 4, 
they intervene with each other in the combustion 
chamber 4 and a turbulence occurs. Because of the 
turbulence, the intake air mixes with a fuel in a 
desired manner. As a result, a combustion of less 
HC, CO and smokes is realized. Numeral 3 designates 
an intake valve and 5 designates an exhaust valve. An example of a three-valve engine is seen in Japanese 
Utility Model Application, Publication No. 59-192625. 
A fundamental teaching of this publication 
is illustrated in Figure 22 of the accompanying 
drawings. As shown. two intake ports 10 and 20 
extend parallel to each other and perpendicular to a 
crankshaft direction (not shown) to generate first 
and second swirls "alpha" and "beta", respectively. 
Means M is provided for deviating the flow direction 
of the second swirl "beta" generated in the second 
intake port 20. The second swirl "beta" is deviated 
such that the second swirl "beta" from the second 
intake port 20 and the first swirl "alpha" from the 
first intake port 10 flow in the same direction in a 
combustion chamber 50. The swirl deviation means M 
is a stationary shroud in Figure 22, but it is a 
masking plate in another embodiment. Incidentally, 
Numeral 30 designates an exhaust port, 40 designates 
a spark plug and 01 designates a center of
