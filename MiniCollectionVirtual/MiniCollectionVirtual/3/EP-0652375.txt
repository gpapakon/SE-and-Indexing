<ABSTRACT>
A blower assembly (10) for a vehicle heating 
and cooling system has a particularly compact and 

efficient arrangement of components. A blower housing 
(12) has a planar back wall (18) and spiral side wall 

(20), with an electric motor (16) mounted to and 
through the back wall. A cylindrical blower (14) is 

mounted to the drive shaft (34) through a central, 
dome shaped hub (26) that covers the protruding end of 

the motor and runs parallel to the back wall. An 
electrical controller (36) with significant cooling 

demand is mounted to the back wall, close to and 
concentric to both the motor and the blower. A heat 

sink (38) conductively connected through the back wall 
to the controller is located entirely beneath and 

behind the dome shaped blower hub. The rest of the 
air flow space inside the housing is therefore 

unobstructed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to blower assemblies 
and blower housing designs in general for air 
conditioning systems, and specifically to such a 
design with an improved, compact design for a cooling 
means used in conjunction with the blower motor and 
associated speed controller. Vehicle heating and cooling systems have a 
blower assembly with an electric motor driven blower 
enclosed in a housing, often called a scroll housing. 
The blower, typically called a squirrel cage blower, 
has a cylindrical array of axially extending blades 
arranged so as to pull outside air axially in and send 
it radially outwardly in a circular, pressurised flow. 
The scroll housing side wall that surrounds the vanes 
is not concentric, but follows a spiral pattern from a 
narrow point to a widest point near a tangentially 
located outlet opening. The scroll housing wall 
stands out from a planar back wall, to which the 
electric motor is mounted and through which the end of 
the motor and the drive shaft protrude. The blower 
has a hub secured at its centre to the motor drive 
shaft. The blower hub is dome shaped, so as to clear 
the protruding end of the motor. The circular 
perimeter edge of the hub runs parallel to the housing 
back wall, with a small gap. There are cooling demands associated with 
the motor and with the motor speed controller. The 
motor is cooled, in some designs, with an air tube 
that picks up moving air out of the scroll housing 
outlet and ducts it back to the motor housing. Another 
approach is to provide vents or vane like structures 
in the blower hub to circulate air behind the hub, 
where it can impact on the protruding end of the 
motor, which is vented. Yet another approach is to  
 
provide separate vanes on the back of the perimeter of 
the hub to pull air beneath the blower hub. Another 
cooling demand is created by mechanisms that control 
the motor speed. Direct current motor speed control 
mechanisms may use a resister to dump extra power, 
which needs to be cooled. This is usually 
accomplished by placing the resistor downstream in the 
blower outlet air flow. Obviously, this represents 
somewhat of a flow obstruction. Another cooling 
demand is created by motor speed control mechanisms, 
such as those using so called pulse width modulation, 
which incorporate heat producing power transistors. 
Such speed controllers would, ideally, be located as 
close as possible to the motor, so as to minimise 
circuit wire lengths. The precipitous switching 
effect of the transistors creates

<CLAIMS>
A blower assembly comprising a blower 
housing (12); an electric blower drive motor (16) with 

a shaft (34) extending through a back wall (18) of the 
housing; an electronic controller (36) for operating 

the motor; and a generally cylindrical blower (14) 
having blades (24) in a cylindrical perimeter array 

and a central hub (26) secured at its centre to the 
shaft in close, parallel proximity to the back wall, 

the hub having a dome shape; characterised by a heat 
sink (38) connected through the back wall to the 

controller and located substantially entirely beneath 
the dome of the hub, whereby air flow from the blower 

is substantially unobstructed. 
A blower assembly as claimed in Claim 1, 
wherein the housing (12) has a spiral shaped side wall 

(20) extending from the back wall (18); wherein the 
array of blades (24) defines a radial clearance 

relative to the side wall that has a narrowest point 
corresponding to an area of maximum air flow behind 

the hub (26) when the blower (14) operates; and 
wherein the heat sink is located in the area of 

maximum air flow. 
A blower assembly as claimed in Claim 1 
or Claim 2, wherein the electronic controller (36) is 

located behind the back wall (18) proximate to and 
concentric with the motor (16).
