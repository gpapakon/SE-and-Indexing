<ABSTRACT>
In a buffer store (MEM2), data packets (D1, D2) are stored which are in each case allocated to one of at least two classes of priority (P1, P2). If the occupancy level (MEMS) of the buffer store (MEM2) exceeds a threshold value, there being such a threshold value for each class of priority, the data packets of the corresponding class of priority are no longer written into the buffer store (MEM2) (so-called "Partial Buffer Sharing"). The invention is characterised by the fact that one or more threshold values are dynamically controlled in order to ensure a lower loss probability for data packets which belong to a high class of priority (P1).

Access control method for a buffer memory (MEM2) in
which data packets (D1, D2) each assigned to one of at

least two priority classes (P1, P2) are jointly stored,
in which a threshold value for a comparison with the

occupancy level (MEMS) of the buffer memory (MEM2) is
assigned to each priority class (P1, P2) and the

threshold value of a higher priority class (P1) is
greater than or equal to that of a lower priority class

(P2), in which the priority class (P1, P2) of a data
packet (D1, D2) arriving at the buffer memory (MEM2) and

the occupancy level (MEMS) of the buffer memory (MEM2)
is determined at the time of arrival of the data packet

(D1, D2), and in which the occupancy level (MEMS) is
compared with the threshold value that is assigned to

the priority class (P1, P2) of the data packet (D1, D2)
and, by means of said comparison, a decision is made as

to whether the data packet (D1, D2) is written into the
buffer memory (MEM2) or whether it is discarded,


characterized in that
 the loss probability of data
packets (D1, D2) of one or more priority classes (P1,

P2) is determined for the regulation of at least one of
the threshold values, and

 at least one of the
threshold values is dynamically regulated by means of

the evaluation of the loss probability of data packets
(D1, D2) determined for one or more priority classes

(P1, P2).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
two events, namely that a data packet (D1, D2) is

written into the buffer memory (MEM2) and that a data 
packet (D1, D2) is discarded, are determined and counted

to determine the loss probability of data packets (D1,
D2) of one or more priority classes (P1, P2).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
respective occupancy level (MEMS) of the buffer memory

loss probability of data packets (D1, D2) of one or more

priority classes (P1, P2).
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the
incoming traffic due to data packets (D1, D2) of one or

more priority classes (P1, P2) is furthermore determined
quantitatively for the regulation of at least one

dynamic regulation of the at least one threshold value.
Method according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the
event that a data packet (D1, D2) arrives at the buffer

memory (MEM2) is determined and counted to determine the

more priority classes (P1, P2).
