<ABSTRACT>
An electrical power-assisted steering system is disclosed comprising a brushless electric motor (1) which has a plurality of phase windings connected at a star point and in which a switching means (13) such as a relay is provided in at least one phase of the motor, the switching means being movable between a closed position in which current is able to flow in the phase winding and an open position which prevents current flowing in the respective phase in the event of a fault. Also disclosed is a substantially rigid connector assembly (19) onto which is mounted the switching means (13), conductors (20) for connecting the motor phase windings and a motor position sensor (21) to an associated motor control means (6), the connector acting as a support for the motor stator, which simplifies the steps involved in assembly. In another aspect of the invention, the electrical power assisted steering system includes a one-piece casing (3) which acts as a housing for the gearset, torque sensor, control means and at least part of the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrical power-assisted steering
system for a vehicle of the kind comprising an electric motor connected
through a gearbox to act on a steering mechanism of the vehicle. For
example, the gearbox may provide a connection between the motor and a
steering column shaft, or directly onto a portion of a rack and pinion
mechanism forming part of the steering mechanism.The electric motor is used to assist a driver in applying torque to
the steering mechanism, by applying an assistance torque of the same
sense, to make it easier to turn the steering wheel, for example during
parking manoeuvres. Thus, operation of the motor may assist in rotating
the steering column shaft, or moving a portion of the steering rack
mechanism. Of course, the motor may be connected to any part of any
typical steering mechanism as long as it can provide an assistance torque
to aid the driver in turning the steering wheel. Paper XP 599 773 (Electric Power Assisted Steering - An Alternative to Hydraulic and Electro-hydraulic Systems; ATZ Automobiltechnische Zeitschrift vol. 98, no. 7/08 1 July 1996, pages 406-408) represents the closest prior art of the invention according to the preamble of claim 1.The motor, which may be a multi-phase brushless star-connected
permanent magnet motor, is controlled by motor control means
comprising control and drive circuits, which is operative to supply a
current from a power supply to the motor phase windings. The phase
windings of the motor are connected at a star point. Each phase is
connected to a positive terminal of the power supply by a top transistor,
and to a negative terminal by a bottom transistor, the two transistors
defining an arm of a multiple arm bridge. This bridge forms the drive
circuits, while the control circuits are provided by a microprocessor or
digital signal processor or analogue signal processing or some
combination thereof. The microprocessor is operative in response to
signals from a torque sensor provided on the steering column to measure 
the torque applied by the driver, from a motor rotor position sensor
providing information about motor speed and direction and optionally
from signals corresponding to current flowing in the motor bridge or
power supply. This information can be used in combination with the
torque sensor signal and/or column position sensor signal to determine
which phase winding should be energised and when. The microprocessor
produces control signals which energise the transistors of the drive
circuits to cause current to
