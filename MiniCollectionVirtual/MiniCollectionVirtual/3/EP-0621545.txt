<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a design and production 
supporting system for arrangements, pipe routing, etc. of 
plant components using a three-dimensional CAD system, and 
more particularly to a design and production supporting system 
which integrates steps from planning and basic designing steps 
to construction and manufacturing steps and is effectual for 
saving of design and production labor. As described in "CAD/CAM in the CIM Period" (P.21 to 
P.53, January 1989, by Nikkei Computer Graphics) and in 
"Appearance of Global CIM Brought by Open CAD" (P.14 to P.29, 
May 1991, by Nikkei Computer Graphics), conventional design 
and production supporting systems have been accomplished by 
developing needed systems or by purchasing them on the market, 
by a design or a productions section individually. In such designing processes, drawings are very 
significant information transferring means. Conventionally, 
what is the most important in designing has been to generate 
such drawings and supporting means to generate such drawings  
 
have been individually developed and put into practical use. 
However, no integrated design and production supporting system 
has been put into practical use. Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No.64-28785, for example, discloses a plant component 
arrangement designing system which transfers system diagrams 
(piping and instrument diagram) which are system design 
information to a three-dimensional CAD, generates 
three-dimensional patterns and arrangements of components from 
the system diagrams, and interconnects the components with 
piping by the three-dimensional CAD. However, this disclosure 
does not describe how two-dimensional system diagrams are 
developed into three-dimensional arrangements of components. As for automatic arrangement and pipe routing of plant 
components in order to further save design and production 
labor, automatic processing techniques as automatic 
arrangement and pipe routing have been developed and put into 
practical use for the electronic design support system 
including the LSI and printed circuit board as discussed in 
"Basics of Ultra-LSI CAD" (by Kaji, Kawanishi and Funazu, 
1983, Ohm Publishing Co., Ltd., Tokyo). The maze method is 
known for automatic placement and routing of the LSI. This 
method requires the range to be divided to a very fine level 
equivalent to line width, raising a problem of extremely 
increased number of the elements. Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 126173-1991 
refers to automatic
