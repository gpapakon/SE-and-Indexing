<ABSTRACT>
The invention is based on a deformable seal of the abovementioned type, having approximately vertically running aprons which are located on both sides of the opening of the building, are fastened laterally outwardly on the vertical profiles and of which the mutually facing edges can be bent by the vehicle, thus effecting deformation of an elastically deformable abutment located at the lower strip end, in the direction of the building, the abutment being at least of an essentially triangular outline. In order to increase the deformability of the abutment, the invention provides that the wall thickness is preferably gradually reduced towards the free outline edge of the abutment. Provision is preferably made here for a triangular configuration, to be precise both upon viewing the seal from the front and upon viewing it transversely thereto.

Deformable seal for sealing the gap between the 
edge of a building opening (2) and the rear of a vehicle 

being positioned thereon, having substantially 
vertically extending aprons (5) which are situated on 

both sides of the building opening (2) and are mounted 
laterally e
xternally on vertical metal profiles, which 
are resiliently displaceable in a direction towards the 

building (1), the edges facing one another of said 
aprons being bendable towards the building (1) by the 

vehicle so as to deform a resiliently deformable 
abutment (9), which is situated internally on the lower 

apron end and serves sealing purposes, the abutment (9) 
having, at least substantially, a configuration in the 

form of a right-angled triangle, the edge (14) which is 
formed by the two lateral faces (12,13) of the abutment 

(9) lying perpendicular to each other facing the corner 
which is formed by the outside of the building (1) and a 

lateral tarpaulin (3), which extends from the metal 
profile to the building (1), characterised in that the 

abutment (9) on the outline edge (16) situated opposite 
the edge (14) has a substantially smaller wall thickness 

than the edge region. 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the wall thickness gradually decreases towards the 

outline edge (16). 
Seal according to claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the abutment (9) has, at least substantially, a 

triangular configuration when the seal is viewed with 
respect to the docking direction.  

 
Seal according to claims 1 and 2, characterised 
in that the abutment (9) has, at least substantially, a 

triangular configuration when the abutment (9) is viewed 
parallel to the outside of the building (1) (arrow III). 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the abutment (9) is only mounted in the region of its 

edge (14). 
Seal according to claim 5, characterised in that 
the edge (14) is provided with a profile, more 

especially a metal profile (15), which extends in the 
direction of the edge, is securely connected to the 

abutment and serves to secure the abutment. 
Seal according to claim 6, characterised in that 
the profile is an angular profile, or respectively an 

angle member (15), which surrounds the edge (14). 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that 
one lateral face (12) of the abutment (9) extends 

substantially over the width of the lateral tarpaulin 
(3). 
Seal according to claim 1, characterised in that 
a lateral face (13) of the abutment (9) extends 

substantially from the lateral tarpaulin (3) to the edge 
of the building opening (2).
