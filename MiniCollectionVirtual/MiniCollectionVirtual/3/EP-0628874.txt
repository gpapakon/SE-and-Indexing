<ABSTRACT>
A printer processor (11a,11e), a film processor (11b,11f), 
and a densitometer (11c) 

are connected to a personal computer (13) via a port controller (12). 
For diagnosing the operation condition of a photographic 

equipment, a check sample is formed by the photographic 
equipment. The check sample is set to the densitometer to 

fetch the measured density data into the personal computer (13). If 
the operation condition of the photographic equipment is 

abnormal, the personal computer fetches the operation data 
under management in the photographic equipment to determine a 

countermeasure against the abnormal state. The countermeasure 
is transferred to the photographic equipment to automatically 

adjust the adjust failure element. In order to remotely 
control a plurality of lab shops, each lab shop is provided 

with a sub-computer connected to the photographic equipment. 
The headquarters are provided with a main computer (191) storing 

therein a management program. The main computer (191) fetches the 
data of the sub-computer via a communication line. In 

accordance with the fetched data, the headquarters (190) remotely 
control the quality, production state, and stock state of 

consumable goods at each lab shop (180,182). 
The port controller (12) finds 

an idle time of a CPU at each lab shop, and fetches the data 
from the photographic equipment during the idle time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for remotely
managing the production conditions
at a plurality of lab shops, and
more particularly to a remote management method suitable for
centralized management of a plurality of minilab shops.A compact and economical photographic apparatus (such as
a printer processor and a film processor) called a minilab
equipment has been recently used widely. Such a minilab
equipment is often installed, for example, within a super
market at a minilab department (minilab shop) to provide
photoprinting services as a sideline. Even an operator having
less photofinishing knowledge can make a properly finished
photographic print (photoprint) using a minilab equipment
having automated functions.It is necessary to check and adjust a photographic
equipment in order to attain a proper quality of a photoprint.
A minilab equipment is usually operated by an operator with
photofinishing knowledge insufficient for proper check and
adjustment. Therefore, a photographic equipment is operated under automatic
control in accordance with various preset data such that
measured data becomes equal to the preset data. Various data
preset for the photographic equipment can be used for quality
management, production management, consumable goods
management, operation condition management, operation
condition history record, analysis of trouble and adjustment
failure, and the like. Generally, the data format is different
between a photographic equipment and a personal computer while
data communication cannot be made during the operation of a
photographic equipment. For these and other reasons, the
conventional management system uses a photographic equipment
and a personal computer in off-line. It becomes therefore
necessary for an operator to input data into a personal
computer through its keyboard and adjust the photographic
equipment accordingly.For the production management of each photographic
equipment, there has been adopted a method of making a note of
the number of finished products, e.g., the number of film
strips for a film processor or the number of photoprints for a
printer processor, and thereafter summing the numbers on the
note. This method does not provide correct production
management, due to forgetting to write the number on a note or 
missing a note. Furthermore, an operator of a minilab
shop of a chain orders consumable goods such as color paper
and processing solution to the headquarters when necessary.
It has been difficult to order at right time in
consideration of delivery

<CLAIMS>
A management method for remotely managing the production
conditions at a plurality of lab shops, said method

comprising the following steps:

connecting at least one photographic apparatus, which
includes a printer processor and a film processor, to a

sub-computer installed at each of said lab shops;
performing production management by fetching into said
sub-computer the production data of said photographic

apparatus; and
determining the consumed state of consumable goods in
accordance with said production data for ordering on-line

said consumable goods to a main computer at the
headquarters via a communication line if a predetermined

amount of said consumable goods are consumed.
A management method according to claim 1, wherein said
production data includes an amount of processed paper and

the number of prints.
A management method according to claim 1, wherein said printer processor,
said film processor, and a densitometer are connected to said sub-computer

via a port controller. 
A management method according to claim 3, wherein said
port contoller comprises:


a switch unit for selecting one device from said printer
processor, said film processor, and said densitometer,

for performing data communication:
a first communication control unit for finding an idle
time of a CPU incorporated in said selected device, and

performing data communication at the data transfer speed
of said CPU during said idle time;
a buffer memory for storing said data fetched irregularly
from said selected device;
a subject communication discriminator unit for

discriminating whether said data in said buffer memory to
be transferred to said sub-computer is the data of said

selected device requested by said sub-computer;
a data format converter unit for converting said data
read from said buffer memory into a data format of said

sub-computer; and
a second communication control unit for transferring said
format-converted data in units of block to said

sub-computer at the data transfer speed of said
sub-computer.
A management method according to claim 1, wherein a port controller is
interposed between a computer and a plurality of photographic apparatus for

performing data communication therebetween, said port controller comprising:

a switch unit for selecting one of said plurality of photographic apparatus, for
performing data communication;
a first communication control unit for finding an idle time of a CPU incorporated
in said selected photographic apparatus, and performing data communication

at the data transfer speed of said CPU during said idle time;
a buffer memory for storing said data fetched irregularly from said selected
photographic apparatus;
a subject communication discriminator unit for discriminating whether said data
in said buffer memory to be transferred to said computer is the data of said

selected photographic apparatus requested by said computer;
a data format converter unit for converting said data read from said buffer
memory into a data format of said computer; and
