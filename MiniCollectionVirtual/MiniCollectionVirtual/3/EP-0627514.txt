<ABSTRACT>
In a fabric for the reinforcement or armouring of sheet-like structures, especially of plaster-layer facings (1) or the like, consisting of warp threads (14) and weft threads (13) which form a basic fabric (11) and an adjoining edge region (12), the edge region (12) is to be thinned in relation to the basic fabric (11).

<CLAIMS>
Fabric for strengthening or respectively reinforcing flat-shaped 
articles, more especially coating layer structures (1) or the like, comprising 

one-layered fabric webs (10a, 10b) laid next to one another, warp threads 
(14) and weft threads (13) forming for each fabric web (10a, 10b) a basic 

fabric (11) and an associated edge region (12), characterised in that the 
edge regions (12) of two adjacent fabric webs (10a, 10b) are thinned and 

overlap one another in an overlapping region (15). 
Fabric according to claim 1, characterised in that the edge region 
(12) is thinned to approximately half of the basic fabric (11). 
Fabric according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the thinning is 
effected by selecting thinner threads (13, 14) for the edge region (12). 
Fabric according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the 
thinning is effected by omitting threads in the edge region (12). 
Fabric according to at least one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in 
that a thread or bundle of threads, formed from a different material from 

that used in the basic fabric (11), is used for the edge region (12). 
Fabric according to at least one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in 
that the warp and weft threads (14, 13) are stabilised, at least in the edge 

region (12).  
 
Fabric according to claim 6, characterised in that the stabilising is 
effected with plastics material, starch, adhesive or the like. 
Fabric according to claim 7, characterised in that the stabilising is 
adapted to the material of the flat-shaped article (1).
