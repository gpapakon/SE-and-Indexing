<DESCRIPTION>
 CELL ASSAY DEVICEThis is a continuation-in-part of pending application Serial No. 07/532,571, filed June 4, 1990.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention is in the field of microphysiometers and, in particular, it relates to single-use disposable devices and reagents, and reusable peripheral parts, used in conjunction with a microphysiometer.Description of the Prior Art The prior art describes cups which have a filter membrane on the bottom and such cups are usable for filtering and grouping cells on the inner surface of the membrane ("Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology", Edited by Barbara B. Mishell and Stanley M. Shiigi, University of California, Berkeley, Editorial Consultants: Claudia Henry and Robert I. Mishell, University of California, Berkeley, Published by W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco,Copyright 1980, pp. 37, 40, 43, 61, 62, 63 and 64). Also of interest are silicon electrodes for use in microflow cells described in U.S. Patents Nos 4,591,550; 4,737,464; 4,741,619; 4,704,353 and 4,519,890. These patents are incorporated herein by reference. Also, see U.S. Patent No. 4,172,770 (Semersky) which describes a flow system and Japanese Patent 1002-060-A which also describes a flow system.Further prior art takes the form of commercially-available single use vessels for the culture of living cells. In general, because of the extreme sensitivity of living cells to the chemical and physical nature of their environment, including potential problems of contamination by endotoxin microorganism or by cleaning solutions, it is preferable to use culture vessels that have been manufactured under carefully controlled conditions and then thrown away rather than cleaned and recycled. Although commercially-available single-use vessels take many forms, including bottles, tubes, and single or multiwell covered dishes, the closest commercially-available prior art items are all essentially manufactured versions of the design described in the first reference given in the previous paragraph (specifically pages 61, 62, 63, 64 of that reference). Manufacturers of such items include Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA, (product name: Transwell) and Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, (product name: Millicell). This device is further described in EPA 239,697.

What is claimed is:
1. A device for removably placing cells in a microflowchamber having a volume of about 10 nanoliters to about 10 microliters of a microphysiometer comprising a porous microchamber which contains cells and retains cells within the microchamber when liquids flow in and out of the microchamber wherein the porous microchamber comprises inner and outer porous membranes separated by a spacer means which is about 25 to 200 micrometers thick.
2. A device for removably placing cells in a microflowchamber having a volume of about 10 nanoliters to about 10 microliters of a microphysiometer comprising a porous microchamber which contains cells and retains cells within the microchamber when liquids flow in and out of the microchamber wherein the porous microchamber comprises a capsule of porous membrane material.
3. A device according to claim 2 with inlet and outlet flow lines directly attached to the porous microchamber whereby liquid is flowed through the inlet flow line into the porous microchamber to contact the cells in the porous microchamber and out of the porous microchamber through the outlet flow line.
4. In combination the porous microchamber of claims 1, 2, or 3 within a microflowchamber having:
(a) a means for flowing liquid in and out of the microflowchamber and
(b) a means for detecting changes in properties of the liquid within the microflowchamber.
5. The combination of claim 4 wherein the height of the microflowchamber is about 50 to 300 micrometers.
6. The combination of claim 4 wherein the cells are held about 10 micrometers to about 300 micrometers from a silicon electrode by the porous microchamber. 



 7. A device for removably placing cells in a microflowchamber of a microphysiometer having a volume of about 10 nanoliters to 10 microliters comprising:
(a) an outer sleeve having a top and bottom opening wherein the bottom opening is covered with a porous membrane;
(b) an inner sleeve fitting within the outer sleeve and having a top and bottom opening wherein the bottom opening is covered with a porous membrane; and
(c) a spacer means having a thickness of about 25 to 200 micrometers between the porous membranes of the inner and outer sleeves which defines an opening and which together with the porous membranes defines a porous microchamber when the inner sleeve is placed within the outer sleeve and both porous membranes are in contact with the spacer means and wherein cells are maintained in the porous microchamber when liquid flows through the porous membranes.
8. A device according to claim 7 wherein the spacer means is a continuous strip of thin plastic material fitting the inner wall of the outer sleeve, defining an opening and having a thickness of about 25 to 200 micrometers.
9. A device according to claim 7 wherein the spacer means is integral with the outer or inner sleeve.
10. A device according to claims 8 or 9 wherein the height of the microflowchamber is about 50 micrometers to about 300 micrometers.
11. A device according to claim 7 wherein the cells are held about
10 to about 300 micrometers from a silicon electrode by the porous microchamber. 


 12. A device according to claim 7 wherein cells are focused on a portion of the membrane in the outer sleeve.
13. A device according to claim 7 wherein the opening defined by the spacer means is covered with a polymer mesh which entraps cells.
14. A device according to claim 13 wherein the polymer mesh is a collagen sponge.
15. A device according to claim 7 wherein non-adherent cells are fixed in a fibrin gel.
16. A device according to claim 14 wherein the cells to be tested are intermixed with polymer matrix particles and cocentrifuged on the porous membrane of the outer sleeve before inserting the inner sleeve.
17. A device according to claim 16 wherein the polymer matrix particles are particles of collagen sponge.
18. In combination with the device of claim 7, a plunger with a top and bottom surface which has openings for directing a stream of liquid through the plunger and which fits into the inner sleeve and the bottom surface of the plunger contacts the porous membrane of the inner sleeve; a silicon electrode which contacts the outer surface of the porous membrane of the outer sleeve wherein when the plunger is pressed a seal is formed between the porous membranes, the spacer means, the plunger and the silicon electrode to define a microflowchamber where liquids are flowed into and out of the microflowchamber having a volume of about 10 nanoliters to about 10 microliters thorugh the openings in the plunger.
19. A device according to claim 7 wherein the inner and outer sleeve is separated by a spacing element.
