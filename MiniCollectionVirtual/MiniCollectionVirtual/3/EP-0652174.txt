<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of transporting an elongate, flexible 
object, such as a belt, chain, wire or web, wherein the speed of a part of 

the elongate object Is periodically varied, while maintaining a constant 
speed of the upstream and downstream parts of the object. The method 

comprises feeding the elongate object (1) past transport members such as 
rotating transport rollers (13,15) which are oscillated parallel to the 

elongate object In the direction of transport and opposite to the direction 
of transport. Three sections (7a,7b,7c) of the elongate object are during 

oscillation of the transport members maintained In a mutually parallel 
relationship. Translation- and rotation balancing means allow the transport 

members to be driven at high speeds and low variations in torque.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of transporting an elongate, flexible 
object along a stationary frame, the elongate, flexible object being 
transported along an upstream trajectory, a downstream trajectory, and an 
intermediate trajectory comprised between the upstream trajectory and 
the downstream trajectory, the method comprising the steps of: 
a moving the elongate, flexible object along the upstream trajectory 
and along the downstream trajectory at a substantially constant speed of 
transport, the upstream and the downstream trajectory being substantially 
stationary relative to the frame, b running the elongate, flexible object along a transport member that 
is periodically displaceable, the transport member having an upstream 
and a downstream part, and c periodically displacing the transport member around a stationary 
equilibrium position. The invention further relates to an apparatus for carrying out said method 
and to a method of manufacturing in which the speed of the elongate, 
flexible object is varied in accordance with said method. Such a method and apparatus are known from EP-A-0 364 087.  In the above patent application, a device is disclosed for applying layers of 
material in a direction, generally transversely across a longitudinal web, 
which web moves continuously through the device in the machine 
direction at a predetermined web speed. The machine direction 
corresponds to the longitudinal direction of the web. The device 
comprises two transport members which each deflect the web through 
90°, in the plane of the web. A transverse web portion of constant length, 
extending perpendicular to the machine direction, is comprised between 
the transport members, which are formed by air bars. The transport 
members are mounted on a cart which can be reciprocated in the machine 
direction. When the transport members are moved in the transport direction of the 
web, at a speed which equals the web speed, the web portion between the 
transport members is stationary relative to the transport members. The 
transverse web portion is in this case stationary in the direction 
perpendicular to the machine direction, i.e. in the cross machine 
direction. An applicator, which moves in synchronism with the 
intermediate part of the web in the machine direction, can apply for 
instance strips of elastic material to the intermediate part of the web, 
without movement of the applicator in the cross-machine direction. These 
strips of elastic material extend in the transverse direction of the
