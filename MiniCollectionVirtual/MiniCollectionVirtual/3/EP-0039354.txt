Production of Carboxylic   -Acids -a-nd    Their Esters


This invention concerns a process for the preparation of carboxylic acids and their ester derivatives by reaction of alcohols and their derivatives with carbon monoxide. More specifically, the inventive process concerns the selective synthesis of aliphatic carboxylic acids and their esters from aliphatic alcohols by reaction with carbon monoxide in the presence of a supported ruthenium-containing catalyst component and a halogen-containing promoter. Eq. 1 is illustrative of this process, where R is a linear, branchedchain or cyclic saturated hydrocarbyl radical containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Methanol carbonylation to acetic acid is a specific illustration of this general synthesis.
EMI5.1     



A wide variety of aliphatic carboxylic acids of differing carbon numbers and structures are presently important articles of commerce. The production of acetic acid, for example, now exceeds 2 billion lbs. per annum in the United
States*; important applications for this acid include the production of cellulose acetate and vinyl acetate. There are several commercially proven routes to acetic acid manufacture*, including oxidation of ethylene via acetaldhyde, liquid-phase oxidation of saturated hydro-carbons, n-butene oxidation and methanol carbonylation. To the extent that methanol is currently produced from *See: "Trends in   Petrrrhnical    Technology" by A. M. Brcwnstein (1976),
Chapters 4 and 5; and   "Petrochemicals      fran    Coal" by P. M. Spitz,   Clgatech;   
May 1977, p. 295.  


synthesis gas (a mixture of CO and hydrogen), acetic acid via methanol carbonylation also effectively becomes a 1syngas' chemical. Furthermore, since syngas may be generated from a variety of sources, including heavy oil residuals and coal stocks*, this syngas route to acetic a cid will likely become increasingly important in an era of petroleum shortages.


Carbonylation processes for the preparation of carboxylic acids from alcohols are well known in the-art. These have been directed especially to the production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol. In particular, a variety of soluble and supported forms of cobalt, nickel, iron, iridium and rhodium have been patented in recent years as catalysts for methanol carbonylation to acetic acid. In the case of carbonylation processes of the prior art, comprising the metal carbonyls or modified metal carbonyls of cobalt, iron and nickel, each are characterized.by the need for high partial pressures of carbon
