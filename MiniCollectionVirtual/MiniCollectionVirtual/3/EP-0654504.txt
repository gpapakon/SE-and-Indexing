<ABSTRACT>
A resin composition comprising a saturated 
polyester resin consisting chiefly of a hydroxyalkanoate 

unit, a heat-moldable hydroxyl group-containing resin 
having a vinyl alcohol unit, and an alkaline earth metal 

carbonate, a molded article composed of this resin 
composition and, particularly, a container and a 

multi-layer plastic container having an outer layer 
formed of this resin composition and an inner layer of a 

resin consisting chiefly of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol 
copolymer. The resin composition and the molded 

articles thereof exhibit not only excellent mechanical 
properties but also excellent bio-disintegrating 

property.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aliphatic 
polyester resin composition having improved 
bio-disintegrating property and mechanical properties 
and, particularly, improved anisotropy in the mechanical 
strength and anisotropy in the thermal contraction and 
improved bio-disintegrating property, and further 
relates to containers using the same resin composition. The amount of solid wastes produced by cities is 
increasing year after year and are approaching the limit 
of the capacity of waste disposal. One of the culprits 
of solid wastes comes from the plastic materials as is 
frequently pointed out. Disintegrable plastics are drawing attention as an 
ideal solution for the plastic wastes. The 
disintegrable plastics may include photo-disintegrable 
plastics of which the polymer chains are cut by 
ultraviolet rays and bio-disintegrable plastics that 
disintegrate due to the action of enzymes emitted from 
bacteria and true fungi. The photo-disintegrable plastics, however, will not 
disintegrate as expected when they are buried in the 
earth and, besides, the disintegrated products thereof 
may contaminate the environment. Accordingly, much 
expectation has been placed on the bio-disintegrable 
plastics. As bio-disintegrable plastics, there have 
heretofore been known a polyhydroxybutylate (PHA), a  
 
3-hydroxybutylate (3HB) and a 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV). There has also been known a resin composition 
obtained by blending a bio-disintegrable plastic such as 
a polycaprolactone (PCL) with another resin. For 
instance, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 
139248/1992 discloses a bio-disintegrable resin 
composition comprising 5 to 99% by weight of an 
ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer and 95 to 1% by weight 
of an aliphatic polyester. Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication 
No. 84876/1993 discloses a bio-disintegrable resin 
laminate comprising a bio-disintegrable polyester/a 
polyvinyl alcohol/a bio-disintegrable polyester. The known bio-disintegrable plastics remain stable 
in the air and are disintegrated in the earth and in the 
water where bacteria are active. The disintegrated 
products turn into- carbonic acid gas and water. They are 
still accompanied, however, by problems in regard to 
properties of molded articles such as containers which 
account for a major use of the plastics and the 
production, which must be solved. Conventional PHA bio-disintegrable 
plastics have a decomposition temperature and a molding 
temperature which are close to each other like 180 to 
190 °C
