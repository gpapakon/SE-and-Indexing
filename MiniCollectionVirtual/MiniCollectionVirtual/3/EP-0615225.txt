<ABSTRACT>
A two-dimensional ultrasonic transducer array 
(10) includes a plurality of transducer elements (12-18), 

with each element having a plurality of piezoelectric 
layers (120A, 120B and 120C). The transducer elements 

vary in transverse areas of radiating regions. The 
effect of the variations in transverse areas on the electrical 

impedances of the elements is at least partially 
offset by varying the specific impedance, i.e., impedance 

per unit area, of the transducer elements in the array. 
In a preferred embodiment, the specific impedance is 

varied by selecting the electrical arrangements of 
piezoelectric layers in each element according to the 

transverse area of the element. Series, parallel and 
series-parallel arrangements are employed. This impedance 

normalization improves the electrical connection of 
the transducer elements to driving circuitry (29A). In 

alternative embodiments, impedance normalization is 
achieved by varying element thicknesses, element materials 

and/or degrees of poling across the two-dimensional 
array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to 
acoustic transducers and more particularly to two-dimensional 
ultrasonic transducer arrays. A diagnostic ultrasonic imaging system for 
medical use forms images of tissues of a human body by 
electrically exciting a transducer element or an array of 
transducer elements to generate short ultrasonic pulses, 
which are caused to travel into the body. Echoes from 
the tissues are received by the transducer element or 
array of transducer elements and are converted into electrical 
signals. The electrical signals are amplified and 
used to form a cross sectional image of the tissues. 
Echographic examination is also used outside of the medical 
field. While a number of advances have been made in 
echographic examining, further advances in optimizing 
acoustical properties of a transducer face the potential 
problem of sacrificing desired electrical properties. 
Initially, an imaging transducer consisted of a single 
transducer element. Acoustical properties were improved 
by providing a transducer formed by a one-dimensional 
array of transducer elements. Conventionally, 
one-dimensional transducer arrays have a rectangular 
or circular configuration, but this is not critical. 
Acoustical properties may be improved by providing a 
two-dimensional array in either a rectangular or annular 
configuration. Focusing plays an important role in optimizing 
the acoustical properties of a transducer device. U.S. 
Pat. No. 4,477,783 to Glenn describes a mechanical lens  
 
used to focus acoustic energy to and from a single transducer 
element. Electronic focusing provides an alternative 
to the mechanical lens. Two-dimensional arrays can 
be phased by delaying signals to selected transducer 
elements so as to achieve a desired direction and focal 
range. Electronically focused transducer arrays offer 
the advantage that they can be held stationary during an 
echographic examination, potentially increasing resolution 
and the useful life of the device. The transducer 
elements are equal in size, so that a two-dimensional 
array can form a piecewise approximation of the desired 
curved delay profile. In order to reduce the total number 
of transducer elements, the number of transducer elements 
in the elevation dimension can be reduced. To obtain 
acceptable focusing properties, these elevation 
transducer elements are often different sizes to form a 
coarser piecewise linear approximation of the desired 
curved delay profile. The problem is that there are 
difficulties in
