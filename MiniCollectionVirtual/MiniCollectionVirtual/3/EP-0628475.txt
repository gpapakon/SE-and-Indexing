<ABSTRACT>
A derailleur that can provide a speed-change operation while performing a braking operation and which 
can provide an optimum speed-change operation for various running conditions. Namely, provided on the outer 

circumference of a gripping portion of a handle bar (3) are a first speed-change 
operating body (14) and a second 

spedd-change operating body (103) that are supported such that they can be rotated around the axis of the handle bar, 
a cable winding body (107) adapted to be rotated by rotation of these speed-change 

operating bodies so as to pull in 
or pay out a speed-change operating cable, and a locking mechanism (15) for locking the cable winding body at a 

predetermined rotating position, the first speed-change operating body being connected to the cable winding body in 
such a manner that the cable winding body is integrally rotated in cable pulling-in 

and paying-out directions, while 
the second speed-change operating body being connected to the cable winding body via a transmission mechanism 

(127) for rotating the cable winding body in the cable pulling-in or paying-out 
direction through reciprocating rotating 

operations from a predetermined rotation starting point.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bicycle speed change 
operation assembly. More specifically the present invention 
relates to a bicycle speed change operation assembly wherein a 
speed change operation can be performed during a braking 
operation. A bicycle speed change assembly for sports type bicycles is 
commonly mounted on a bicycle frame member such as the down tube 
or the top tube. Therefore, the rider must unhand the handlebar 
to perform a speed change operation. As a result, it is impossible to immediately perform a 
braking operation during the speed change operation. In addition, 
the rider has to assume a single hand steering, which leads to 
unstable handlebar operation and poor safety. On the other hand the speed change operation is required, in 
general, when road conditions change, for example, from a flat 
road to a slope, or vice versa. In such occasions the bicycle 
becomes unstable and the brake operation is often needed. In an attempt to solve this problem the Japanese Utility 
Model Laid-open 58-46693 discloses a grip rotating type speed  
 
change operation assembly, wherein a cylindrical operation member 
is fitted around each of the left and right grip portion of the 
handlebar, and these cylindrical operation members are rotated to 
pull or pay out the speed control cable. In this grip rotating type speed change operation assembly, 
it becomes possible to perform a speed change operation without 
unhanding the handlebar grip portion, resulting in remarkable 
improvement in riding safety during speed change operation. In off-road riding on a mountain bike for example, it is 
sometimes necessary to perform a speed change operation during a 
braking operation. In such a case, with the conventional grip rotating type 
speed change operation assembly, the brake must be operated while 
the cylindrical operation member gripped by the hand and fingers 
must be rotated at the same time. However, when the speed change 
operation is required through a plurality of speed steps, the 
amount of rotation required for the speed change operation member 
becomes large, and therefore, the hand and finger must be repositioned. 
Thus, it is very difficult to perform a speed change 
operation in optimum response to different riding situations while 
keeping the fingers engaged with the brake lever. In addition the speed change operation is performed in 
various ways in response to the changing running situation; 
sometimes the speed change operation is made in a stepped manner, 
or some other

<CLAIMS>
A bicycle speed change operation assembly comprising: 
a first speed change operation member and a second speed change 

operation member each supported around a grip end portion of the 
handlebar about an axis of a handlebar for rotation; 

   a cable winding member rotated in response to a rotating 
operation of the speed change operation members for winding or 

paying out a speed control cable; and 
   a retaining mechanism for holding the cable winding member at 

a predetermined rotational position; 
   wherein the first speed change operation member is connected 

to the cable winding member for integral rotation therewith in a 
cable pulling direction and a cable paying out direction; 

   whereas the second speed change operation member is connected 
to the cable winding member by a transmission mechanism for 

rotating the cable winding member in the cable pulling direction 
or the cable paying out direction in response to rotational 

reciprocation of the second speed change operation member from a 
predetermined commencing point. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 1, wherein at least one of the first and second speed change 

operation members is cylindrical and rotatably fitted around the 
grip end portion of the handlebar. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 1, wherein the second speed change operation member is 

elastically urged by a spring to the commencing point for 
rotation in the cable pulling direction or cable paying out 

direction; and 
   the transmission mechanism allows the second speed change 

operation member to rotate with the cable winding member when the 
second speed change operation member is rotated in the cable 

pulling or paying out direction from the commencing point but to 
cancel rotational coupling relation between the second spee
d 
change operation member and the cable winding member when the 

second speed change operation member rotates back toward the 
commencing point. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 1, wherein the second speed change operation member is 

elastically urged by a spring to a neutral position which 
provides the commencing point for rotation in the cable winding 

direction and cable paying out direction; and 
   the transmission mechanism allows the second speed change 

operation member to rotate with the cable winding member when the 
second speed change operation member in the cable winding or 

paying out direction from the neutral point but to cancel 
rotational coupling relation between the second speed change 

operation member and the cable winding member when the second 
speed change operation member rotates back toward the neutral 

position. 
The bicycle speed change operation assembly according to 
Claim 1, wherein the second speed change operation member is 

provided with a press operation portion projecting radially 
outward for operation with a rider's finger.
