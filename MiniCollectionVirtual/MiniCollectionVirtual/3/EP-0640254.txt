<ABSTRACT>
An inductively coupled power distribution system for moving vehicles, in which resonating primary circuits distribute power for resonating secondary circuits to collect and use in an optimised manner. In order to have all circuits resonating at substantially the same frequency, means to detect and adjust resonating components are used, for example the circuit (700) illustrates a frequency drift compensator applicable to several embodiments wherein elements (702-709) compare the present frequency to a reference voltage and cause the driver (711) to be ON or OFF accordingly. Switches (712 and 713) are thereby driven CLOSED or OPEN respectively and when CLOSED, the supplementary capacitors (714 and 715) are included with the main capacitor (716) in the primary resonant circuit. Dithering or pulsed control provides a continuous control of resonance as the system takes some milliseconds to respond.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the provision of inductively coupled electric power across a
gap to mobile or portable power consuming devices such as vehicles. It more
particularly relates to those inductively coupled systems that employ resonant circuits,
and most particularly to ways to maintain mutually consistent resonant frequencies in
both primary and secondary circuits.Modern semiconductor developments have made feasible the provision of inductively
coupled power to moving vehicles, and have permitted the use of resonant LC circuits
in either or both the primary and the secondary circuits. Resonance provides - among
other advantages - (a) large circulating currents despite relatively small power supplies,
(b) relatively low emission of electromagnetic fields at harmonics of the operating
frequency, (c) small ferromagnetic cores, if any, and (d) novel means for control of the
electromagnetic coupling across spaces.Clearly the system will be most efficient when all resonant circuits resonate naturally at
substantially the same frequency, and substantially in phase. Despite careful tuning at
the time of installation, effects on inductance and also on the operating parameters of
switches caused by varying loads can cause operating frequencies to change. This
variability owes its origin in part to combined use in preferred embodiments of the
invention of the trackway conductor as both the resonating inductor and as the emitter
of changing magnetic fields. The resonant inductor is actually the distributed
inductance of the trackway and is inherently vulnerable to induced currents in adjacent
secondary coils, which vary according to consumption. The preferred prior-art
switching power supply simply detects each zero crossing within the current in the
resonant circuit and causes immediate switching transitions. It has no means to 
determine the actual operating frequency apart from a momentarily applied start-up oscillator.The tightness of primary-secondary coupling may give rise to more than one condition for
which the entire system appears to be in resonance but generally only one of these conditions
correlates to a frequency at which optimal power transfer can take place.Because the efficiency of power transfer will fall if the resonant frequencies are not well
matched, it is hence desirable to maintain a relatively constant operating frequency during all
reasonable conditions of use.Prior art in the field of inductive power transfer, wherein the primary current is manipulated,
includes EP 0 473 957,
