<ABSTRACT>
Aluminium-containing substrate for enamel coatings, containing an oxide layer at least on the sides of the enamel coatings, the substrate containing a surface layer of aluminium or an aluminium alloy and carrying on this layer a porous oxide layer more than 0.2 mu m thick, with a pore diameter of from 0.03 to 0.15  mu m and a pore depth/diameter ratio of from 2 to 60. An enamel coating is applied to the substrate in a thickness of, for example, from 50 to 200  mu m. The enamelled substrates can be used as exterior trim or cladding on vehicles or buildings, the enamel-coated substrates having outstanding protection against external influences.
