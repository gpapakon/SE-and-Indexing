<ABSTRACT>
Dispersing agents contain (A) alkyl- and/or alkenylpolyglycosides having the formula (I): R1-O-(G)p, in which R1 stands for an alkyl and/or alkenyl residue with 6 to 22 carbon atoms, (G) stands for a sugar residue with 5 to 6 carbon atoms and p stands for a number from 1 to 10; and/or (B) polyhydroxylic fatty acid amides having the formula (II): R2-CO-N(R3)-(Z), in which R2CO stands for an aliphatic acyl residue with 6 to 22 carbon atoms, R3 for hydrogen, an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl residue with 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R3 for hydrogen, an alkyl or hydroxyalkyl residue with 1 to 4 carbon atoms and (Z) for a linear or branched polyhydroxyalkyl residue with 3 to 10 carbon atoms and 3 to 10 hydroxyl groups, and if required (C) other anionic, non-ionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic tensides and/or polymers. These dispersing agents are characterized by a remarkable dispersing power and easy biological degradability. They are suitable for preparing dyes and pigments compositions.
