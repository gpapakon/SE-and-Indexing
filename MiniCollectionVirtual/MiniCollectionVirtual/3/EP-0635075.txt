<ABSTRACT>
Described is a method of coating substrates by means of a chemical vapour deposition process using at least one reagent gas which is passed over the substrate in at least one carrier gas. The method is characterized by the combination of the following elements: the carrier gas is an inert gas or a mixture of inert gases; the reagent gas or gases consist of compounds which are non-toxic and/or present no fire risk and which, after the reaction, form no compounds which are toxic or present a fire risk.
