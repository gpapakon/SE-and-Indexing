<ABSTRACT>
In accordance with the figure, encapsulated positioned measuring devices (1) have a housing (2) with a longitudinal slot (2a) which is sealed by means of sealing lips (7 and 8). The sealing lips (7 and 8) are made from elastic synthetic material. In order for the sealing lips (7 and 8) also to be able to contribute to the electric screening, they are produced from an electrically conductive plastic.

An encapsulated position measuring device (1), for measuring the relative position of two objects
movable with respect to one another, whose housing (2) which can be connected to one of the

objects to be measured has a slot at at least one side running in the direction of movement of the
object which is movable in the case in question, through which slot a drive carrier (5) which can

be connected to the other object projects into the interior of the housing and is for its part
connected to a unit fitted in the housing (2) and serving for the position measurement, wherein the

slot is sealed throughout by means of elastic sealing elements (7, 8) arranged along the slot and
through which the drive carrier (5) engages, characterized in that the elastic sealing elements (7,

8) are in one piece and consist of electrically conductive, non-metallic material in the form of
lamellae.
An encapsulated position measuring device (1) according to claim 1, characterized in that the
elastic sealing elements (7, 8) consist of conductive plastics material.
An encapsulated position measuring device (1) according to claim 1, characterized in that the
elastic sealing elements (7, 8) consist of conductive rubber.
An encapsulated position measuring device (1) according to claim 1, characterized in that the
conductivity is achieved by addition of conductive particles in the material of the sealing

elements.
An encapsulated position measuring device (1), for measuring the relative position of two objects

movable with respect to one another, whose housing (2) which can be connected to one of the
