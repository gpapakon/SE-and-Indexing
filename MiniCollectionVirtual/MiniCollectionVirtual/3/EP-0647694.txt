<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to organic
electroluminescent (EL) elements.It is considered that the light emission of an
organic electroluminescent element is caused by a phenomenon
where holes and electrons injected from electrode are
recombined within a luminescent layer to generate excitons,
and the excitons excite molecules of luminescent materials
constituting the luminescent layer. By employing fluorescent
dye as a luminescent material, there can be obtained an emission
spectrum, as an electroluminescence, being equivalent to
photoluminescence of the dye molecules.Tang and Vanslyke recently proposed an element
comprising two layers of a hole-transport layer and an
electron-transport luminescent layer which efficiently emits
green light at a lower voltage of about 10 V compared with a
conventional organic electroluminescent element of a single-layer
structure [C.W. Tang and S.A. Vanslyke; Appl. Phys.
Lett., 51 (1987) 913]. This element's structure is, as shown
in Fig. 19 (a), composed of an anode 91, a hole-transport
layer 92, an electron-transport luminescent layer 93 and a
cathode 94, which are formed in this order on a glass 
substrate 90.In this element, the hole-transport layer 92 not
only allows holes to be injected from the anode 91 into the
electron-transport luminescent layer 93, but prevents
electrons injected from the cathode 94 from escaping into the
anode 91 without recombining with the holes, so that the
electrons are contained into the electron-transport
luminescent layer 93. Thus, the electron containment effect
due to the hole-transport layer 92 facilitates the
recombination of the holes and the electrons compared with the
conventional single-layer structure element, resulting in a
substantial decrease in drive voltage.Saito et al. showed that not only the electron-transport
layer but hole-transport layer can become the
luminescent layer in the two-layer structure element [C.
Adachi, T. Tsutsui and S. Saito; Appl. Phys. Lett., 55 (1989)
1489].Saito et al. also proposed a three-layer structure
organic electroluminescent element wherein an organic
luminescent layer is interposed between a hole-transport layer
and an electron transport layer [C. Adachi, S. Tokito, T.
Tsutsui and S. Saito; Jpn. J. Appl. Phys., 27 (1988) L269].The two-layer structure element of Saito et al. is,
as shown in Fig. 19 (b), composed of an anode 91, a hole-transport
luminescent layer 95, an electron-transport layer 96 
and a cathode 94, which are formed in this order on a glass
substrate 90. In contrast to
