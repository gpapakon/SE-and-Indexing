<ABSTRACT>
There is provided a column electrode drive 
circuit applicable to a display-integrated type tablet. A 

hold circuit (24) has a plurality D-flip-flops (27, 28, 
29). To clock terminals (CK) of the flip-flops is input an 

output signal of an AND circuit (26) which receives inputs 
of a hold signal (LS) and a clock signal (CK'). To data 

terminals (D) of the flip-flops are input sampled display 
signals (S1, S2, ..., Sn). With the above-mentioned 

arrangement, when the hold signal (LS) is at "H" level, the 
sampled display signals (S1, S2, ..., Sn) are sequentially 

output as display signals (H1, H2, ..., Hn) without 
modification based on the clock signal (CK'). When the 

hold signal (LS) is a pulse signal, the sampled display 
signals (S1, S2, ..., Sn) are simultaneously output and 

held as the display signals (H1, H2, ..., Hn) . By thus 
making a simultaneous output function and a sequential 

output function compatible, the column electrode drive 
circuit can be utilized as a column electrode drive circuit 

for the display-integrated type tablet device.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a column
electrode drive circuit of a liquid crystal display device,
and more particularly to a column electrode drive circuit
of an active matrix type liquid crystal display device.Conventionally, an active matrix type liquid
crystal display device in which a switching transistor is
additionally provided for each pixel of a display panel has
been extensively used as a display device for a pocketable
information apparatus or the like for the reason that a
high contrast can be obtained by the switching function of
the transistor even when multi-line multiplex drive is
executed.Fig. 14 is a block diagram showing the generic
construction of the active matrix type liquid crystal
display device. Referring to Fig. 14, a switching transistor 1-d
is connected to a pixel 1-c provided at an intersection of
a row electrode 1-a and a column electrode 1-b on one of
two substrates which are arranged opposite to each other at
a specified distance to constitute part of an LCD panel 1.
A row electrode drive circuit 2 sequentially applies to
each row electrodes 1-a a scanning pulse for sequentially
turning on each switching transistor 1-d connected to each
of plural number of row electrodes 1-a arranged in parallel
with each other. Meanwhile, a column electrode drive
circuit 3 applies simultaneously to every column electrode
1-b a voltage corresponding to the density of an image to
be displayed on each pixel 1-c relevant to one row
electrode 1-a.A control circuit 4 controls the row electrode
drive circuit 2 and the column electrode drive circuit 3 to
display an image on a pixel matrix on the LCD panel 1.Fig. 11 is a block diagram showing the internal
construction of the column electrode drive circuit 3 shown
in Fig. 14, while Fig. 12 is a timing chart of signals in
the column electrode drive circuit 3.The following describes the operation of the
column electrode drive circuit 3 based on Figs. 11 and 12.Referring to Fig. 11, the column electrode drive
circuit 3 is composed of a shift register circuit 5, a 
sampling circuit 6, a hold circuit 7, and a level selector
circuit 8. The shift register circuit 5, sampling circuit
6, hold circuit 7, and level selector circuit 8 are each
composed of a number of elements corresponding to the
number of "n" of the column electrodes 1-b.A display signal D input to each element of the
sampling circuit 6 is a signal representing the density of
an image to be displayed on each pixel. The display signal
D is normally input serially one pixel by one pixel in
