<DESCRIPTION>
The field of art to which this invention pertains is
valve metal material, anodes and capacitors made therefrom,
and methods of making the same.Tantalum capacitors of the solid-electrolyte type have
been a major contributor to the miniaturization of electronic
circuitry. They also have the advantage of operating over a
wide temperature range and have good shelf life, long service
life and are useful in extreme environments.Typically such capacitors have been manufactured by
compressing tantalum powder into a pellet, and sintering the
pellet to form a porous body. The porous body is then
anodized in a suitable electrolyte to form a continuous
dielectric oxide filn on the sintered body. The pores are
filled with an electrolyte and a lead wire is attached to form
the capacitor. Porous electrodes have also been produced by
inserting tantalum filaments into holes drilled longitudinally
in a copper billet. The method, disclosed by Wong, in U.S.
Patent No. 5,034,857, further extrudes, draws, restacks, and
reduces the billet. The composit billet extrusion is further
cut and reduced, resulting in a composite rod product which
is treated, to leach out the copper, and anodized.As the requirements for smaller and smaller anodes come
out of the electronics industry with the increased
miniaturization of electronics, this presents new challenges
to the tantalum anode industry. With smaller and smaller
anodes, the lack of high frequency performance of the anode
becomes a bigger and bigger problem. Furthermore, the smaller
the anode, the greater difficulty manufacturers are confronted
with in automated handling of the anodes, e.g. in attaching 
a lead wire. Certain manipulation is required to attach such
a wire, and it becomes difficult to handle the miniaturized
anodes in a manner sufficient to cost effectively attach such
a wire. Accordingly, what is needed in the art is an
improved method for making smaller anodes, and anodes
themselves which overcome such difficulties.Tantalum material particularly adapted for
electrode use is described. The tantalum material
comprises discreet structures having a cross-section of
thin plates of tantalum separated from each other by
gaps except at a number of plate intersections where
metallurgical bonds are established between the plates
to assure that the plates are electrically
interconnected within the cross section, which also
provides structural stability. The plates in this
configuration are substantially parallel to each other
along one longitudinal direction, and in this
