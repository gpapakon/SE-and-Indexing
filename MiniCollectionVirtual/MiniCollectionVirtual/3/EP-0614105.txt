<ABSTRACT>
A contact lens for correcting astigmatism. The front surface 
has a central optical zone and an outer carrier having two points of 

maximum thickness located at an oblique angle of about 110° to 130° as 
measured from the vertical axis of the lens. The anterior surface of the 

lens is symmetrical about its vertical axis. The carrier tapers from the 
points of maximum thickness to thin portions at the top and bottom of the 

lens. 
The rear surface of the lens has an outer spherical base 
curve zone, an inner toric zone, and an intermediate transition zone 

having thickness that gradually increase from the base curve zone to the 
toric zone. By making the radius of the base curve zone substantially 

equal to that of the toric zone's major meridian, a thinner, more 
comfortable lens is obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
Astigmatism is a defect in the eye that is corrected by a
lens with a non-spherical prescription. The prescription, which is usually
expressed as cylinder on the patient's prescription order, causes at least
a portion of the surface of the lens to have the shape of a toric segment.
Hence, such lenses are called toric lenses.Soft contact lenses which have been designed for use to
correct astigmatism are well known in the art. An ideal lens for
correcting astigmatism provides, besides good rotational
orientation and good rotational stability 
comfort to its wearer. In general the thinner the lens and the
smoother the lens surface, the more comfort it will provide.Lenses in accordance with this invention are preferably
soft contact lenses, which may be formed of many materials including
hydroxyethylmethacrylate, metallo-organic substances, silicone rubbers
and various other materials such as described in U.S.-A-3,503,942
and 3,639,524. The preferred soft contact lenses are
hydrophilic; that is, they absorb water and, in fact, the water becomes an
integral part of their structure. Hydrophilic contact lenses made in
accordance with U.S.-A-4,405,773 are especially preferred for
practicing this invention.U.S.-A-4,084,890, discloses a contact lens which
is alleged to have improved adherence to the cornea and improved
visual acuity as a result of its configuration. The lens tapers from a thin
outer edge to an intermediate point of maximum thickness and then
tapers to the center of the lens. The peripheral surface portion is wedge
shaped in cross section. However this lens is believed to be
uncomfortable because of its thickness.U.S.-A-4,324,461, discloses a contact lens for
correcting astigmatism.
However the thicker ballast 
portion of the lens is believed to cause discomfort compared to the lens
of the present invention.While the posterior surface of a contact lens is generally
spherical in configuration, where the lens is to used to correct
astigmatism it will have a toric configuration. That is, the curved portion
of the posterior of the lens has a major and minor axis; the radius of
curvature of the posterior surface of the lens being longer in the major-axis
direction than in the minor-axis direction. The result is that rather
than being of a spherical configuration, the posterior of the lens has a
toric configuration with the major axis running orthogonal to the minor
axis. The major diameter of the toric curve is generally smaller in
diameter than the overall lens, and is cut into a starting base curve

<CLAIMS>
A contact lens for correcting astigmatism of
general concavo-convex configuration having a posterior

surface comprising:

(a) an outer annular spherical base curve zone (11);
(b) an inner toric zone (14) having a major meridian
(15) and a minor meridian (15') orthogonal to

each other; and
(c) transition zone (12) between the toric zone (14)
and the base curve zone (11) having thickness

that gradually increases from the base curve zone
to the toric zone;

   wherein the radius of the base curve zone (11) is
substantially equal to the radius of the major meridian

(15); the intersection (17) of the minor meridian (15') and the border
between the transition zone (12) and the inner toric zone (14) is located no more than 0.12 mm

below an imaginary extension of the spherical base curve
zone (11) passing above that intersection; and the

intersection of the major meridian (15) and the border between the transition
zone (12) and the inner toric zone (14) is located no more than 0.07 mm below an

imaginary extension of the spherical base curve zone (11)
passing above that intersection.
A contact lens in accordance with claim 1 wherein the
intersection of the minor meridian (15') and the transition

zone (12) is located from 0.04 to 0.12 mm below an
imaginary extension of the spherical base curve zone (11).
