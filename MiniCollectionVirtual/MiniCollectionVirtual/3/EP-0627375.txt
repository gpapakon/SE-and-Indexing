<ABSTRACT>
A folding apparatus is preceded by a feed device (14) having a straightening station (19). This has a fixedly arranged aligning element (34) and aligning members (36) pivotable from a position of rest into the working position and back again. The band conveyor (22) conveys the paper web (18) in the conveying direction (F), until the side edge (18') bears for alignment on the aligning element (34) or aligning member (36); the paper web (18) is subsequently conveyed only in the feed direction (Z). The position of the aligning element (34) and of the aligning members (36) is coordinated with the various widths of the paper web (18) to be processed, and the aligning members (36) are brought into the working position in dependence on the width of the paper web to be processed. Paper webs (18) of differing width are aligned automatically.
