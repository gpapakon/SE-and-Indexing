<DESCRIPTION>
This invention of a product and method relates to a 
personalized envelope assembly secured to the interior of a 
printed publication such as a magazine and, more particularly, 
to the means and method for binding in the envelope assembly to 
a personalized and/or customized publication. Over the years, publishers have been interested in both 
customizing and personalizing signatures of magazines -- as 
seen, for example, in Patents 4,576,370 and 5,114,128. The '370 
patent disclosed the idea of tipping an addressed envelope on 
the magazine's exterior. The '128 patent described a means and  
 
method for correlating a personalized signature with the 
addressee information on the cover sticker. More particularly, 
the '128 patent was concerned with avoiding the possibility of 
mix-up -- to prevent the personalized signature from going to no 
person or to the wrong person. Neither patent, however, 
suggested the idea of binding into the publication an envelope 
assembly having high level personalization and/or computerized 
printing on interior and exterior plies that may include 
directed messages, personal data, statistical information, 
pictures, maps, graphs, and/or logos, and have this information 
correlate with the particular recipient of said publication. More particularly, there was no teaching of providing a 
publication having a personalized insert-containing envelope 
bound therein. More specifically, there was no teaching of 
providing a means on an insert-containing envelope assembly for 
attaching the same to the interior of a publication. There have 
been teachings of securing cards to the interior of magazines --as 
seen, for example, in Patent No. 3,819,173. But none of the 
prior art teachings suggested providing a method and means for 
binding in a personalized, envelope assembly to the interior of 
a publication -- and this irrespective of whether the signatures 
component are assembled either by saddle stitching or perfect 
binding. Normally, those publications over about 48 pages were 
perfect bound. The instant invention provides means associated 
with the envelope assembly for attaching in either type of 
binding.  In one preferred embodiment, this binding means takes 
the form of an integral extension of one or both of the outer 
plies of the envelope assembly. This extension may be flap-like 
in the case of saddle stitching for folding so as to have at 
least a portion of the extension or flap draped over the saddle 
conveyor chain. In such a case, the flap to have a dimension
