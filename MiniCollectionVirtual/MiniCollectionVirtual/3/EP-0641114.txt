<ABSTRACT>
A scanner apparatus mountable on a printer output path for scanning images 
on print media driven through a print media path in the printer. The scanner comprises a 

hood which is mountable on said printer output tray. A light source is mounted on an 
internal position of said hood and directed toward said print media path. A mirror 

reflects an image on print media illuminated by said light source. A sensor detects such a 
reflected image and converting it to an electrical signal. The scanner is operable under 

the control of scanner electronics which are inserted into a printer access port normally 
designated to receive font cartridges. The scanner electronics communicates the 

electrical signals to a host personal computer over and I/O cable that is connected 
between the scanner and the personal computer.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to optical scanners used to convert optical images
into digital data for subsequent reproduction and/or manipulation, and more particularly
to optical scanners used in conjunction with printers.Optical scanners have long been used to capture existing optical images so that they
may be transferred, stored, or manipulated using a more convenient means, typically a
digital computer. The scanner captures the image by illuminating the image with a light
source and sensing reflected light. The presence or absence of reflected light at a
particular point determines the image characteristics at that point. For a black and white
image, the absence of reflected light indicates a black region, while the presence of
reflected light indicates a white region. For gray scale images the intensity of the
reflected light must also be measured to determine the intensity of the image. In the case
of color, separate light sources are used to detect the presence or absence of each color
component.Although use of scanners has shown significant increase in the recent past, the
commercial acceptance of the individual scanner has been limited by its cost and
consumption of precious office space. Although not as expensive as many other
computer peripherals, e.g., laser printers, the additional cost can be prohibitively
expensive, especially if the device is used only by a single user.In addition to the cost, the consumption of space by a scanner may also be
prohibitive. The computer user already has a computer, a monitor, a printer, and possibly
a fax machine. The computer user, faced with steadily shrinking office space, has been
reluctant to include additional computer peripherals in the confines of the user's
immediate office space. especially if the device is not used frequently. However, this is
exactly what is required for commercial success of the scanner. Commonly, peripherals
that are not in constant use are relegated to a common office area where the device is
shared by all of the people in the office. The effect of relocating the peripheral away 
from the user produces a productivity loss, resulting from walking to and from the
device, proportional to the number of times the user must use the device. Further
productivity is lost when the device is currently in use by another person in the office.
Recently, manufacturers have attempted to address these concerns by combining
computer peripherals into so-called multi-function-peripherals (MFPs) incorporating
one or more of the following:
