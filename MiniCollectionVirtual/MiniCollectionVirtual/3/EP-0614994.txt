<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to spring steel wires for
use in applications where fatigue-resisting property is
required such as valve springs on automobile engines.Conventional techniques on springs having high fatigue-resisting
characteristics have been described, e.g., in
JP-A-4-367346 in which the surface of steel wires is
electropolished or chemically polished so as to remove microdefects
on it, thereby improving the fatigue resistance or the
wires. (The term "JP-A" as used herein means an unexamined
published Japanese patent application.) This approach which
involves electropolishing or chemically polishing the surface
of spring steel wires is effective to a certain extent in
improving the fatigue limit since the surface of the wires is
made smooth. However, further improvements in the fatigue
limit have been impossible on account of the low materials
strength.In JP-A-63052729 there is disclosed the application of electro- or chemical polishing in
order to improve the fatigue resistance of a spring steel. In particular, said prior art
teaches to remove at least that part of a worked stress layer on the surface portion which
previously has been subjected to shot peening or the like. From JP-A-62274051 spring
steels for valve spring manufacturing are known which have tensile strength properties of
2000 N/mm2. In a similar manner JP-A-63250441 teaches to increases the fatigue
properties of a steel material by improving the mechanical strength thereof. The present inventors have made an attempt to improve
the fatigue resistance of a wire in which some kinds of
elements for enhancing the strength of materials are added.
However, the attempt at achieving high fatigue resistance by
enhancing the materials strength has had the problem in that
the increase in materials strength is accompanied by increasing
defect sensitivity and that a micro-defect developing on the
surface can propagate to cause flexural failure due to fatigue.
Hence, it has been impossible to achieve improvement in the
fatigue limit beyond a certain value.The present invention has been accomplished under these
circumstances.An object of the present invention is to provide a
spring steel wire that has good enough fatigue-resisting
property to perform satisfactorily on automobile engines even
when their output power is increased. Said object is achieved by the subject-matters of
independent claims 1 and 3.Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for producing such a
spring steel wire. Said object is achieved by the
