<ABSTRACT>
In order to detect the residual fluid in a reusable bottle (1) being returned, infrared light is sent into the bottle by means of a light source (3). Light emerging from the bottle is detected using a detector (6). On the basis of the attenuation of the light in the bottle, which can be ascertained by the detector, the presence of residual liquid in the bottle can be deduced. The method is highly reliable and economical.

Method for detecting residual liquid in a returned reusable 
bottle (1), in particular a PET bottle, in which 

light, preferably in the infrared range, is projected into 
the bottle through the bottle mouth (4) and at least part of 

the projected light is received outside the bottle (1), and 
in which the received signal is analysed so as to detect the 

presence of residual liquid, characterized in that the receiver 
receives light which has been reflected on a bulb (5) 

in the bottom of the bottle and emerges from the bottle 
laterally. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in that the 
received signal is evaluated by comparison with a preselected 

limit value (18). 
Apparatus for detecting residual liquid in a returned 
reusable bottle (1), in particular a PET bottle, in which 

light, preferably in the infrared range, is projected into 
the bottle and at least part of the projected light is received 

outside the bottle (1), and in which the received 
signal is analysed so as to detect the presence of residual 

liquid, comprising at least one light source (3), preferably 
an infrared light source, arranged on a bottle conveyor in 

such a way that light can be projected through the bottle 
mouth or mouths (4) into at least one bottle (1) at a time, 

at least one receiver device (6), arranged on the bottle 
conveyor so as to be capable of receiving the light emerging 

from the said bottle or bottles (1), and an evaluation unit 
(9) for evaluating the signal from the receiver device (6), 

characterized in that the receiver device is laterally 
located near the bottom end of the bottle (1) so as to receive 

light which has been reflected on a bulb (5) in the 
bottom of the bottle.  

 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in that 
the receiver device (6) has a focusing lens (7). 
Apparatus according to Claim 3 or Claim 4, characterized 
in that the light source (3) has at least one infrared 

light diode.
