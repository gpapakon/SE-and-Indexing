<ABSTRACT>
To prevent the corrosion of organically bonded friction linings, a corrosion prevention coating is claimed which comprises     from 45 to 75% by weight of phenolic resin,   from 20 to 40% by weight of inorganic zinc compounds,   from 0 to 10% by weight of synthetic silicic acid, and from 5 to 15% by weight of adhesive based on modified phenolic resin.     Following its application to the lining support plate, the coating is dried until tack-free and is cured together with the pressed-on friction material and, if appropriate, a layer of adhesive applied in between.

<CLAIMS>
A corrosion-protection agent for organically bonded friction linings, 
characterized in 
that
 it consists of a lacquer of the following composition: 

45 to 75% by weight of phenol resin 
20 to 40% by weight of inorganic zinc compounds 
0 to 10% by weight of synthetic silicic acid and 
5 to 15% by weight of adhesive based on a modified phenol resin. 
A method of protecting organically bonded friction linings from corrosion by coating 
the cleaned lining-support plate, optionally roughened on the surface, with a corrosion-protection 

agent, 
characterized in that
 the lining-support plate is coated with a 
lacquer according to Claim 1 at least on the join side, the lacquer is dried, the friction 

material is stuck on or pressed on hot in a conventional manner and is hardened jointly 
with the lacquer. 
A method according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 an adhesive layer is applied to 
the dried lacquer on the join side of the lining-support plate and is dried, before the 

friction material is bonded to the lining-support plate. 
A method according to Claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 the friction material, the 
layer of lacquer and optionally the adhesive layer are subsequently hardened jointly in a 

furnace after being pressed together.
