<DESCRIPTION>
Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause
of death in the industrialized countries. Despite recent
declines in CHD mortality, CHD is still responsible for
more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. annually. It is
estimated that CHD, directly and indirectly, costs the U.S.
more than $100 billion a year. The primary cause of CHD is
atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by the deposition
of lipids in the arterial vessel wall, resulting in a
narrowing of the vessel passages and ultimately hardening
the vascular system.Atherosclerosis as manifested in its major clinical
complication, ischaemic heart disease, is thought to begin
with local injury to the arterial endothelium followed by
proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells from the
medial layer to the intimal layer along with deposition of
lipid and accumulation of foam cells in the lesion. As the
atherosclerotic plaque develops, it progressively occludes
more and more blood vessel and can eventually lead to
ischaemia or infarction. Therefore, it is desirable to 
provide a method of inhibiting the progression of
atherosclerosis in patients in need thereof.Hypercholesterolemia is an important risk factor
associated with CHD. For example, in December 1984, a
National Institute of Health Consensus Development
Conference Panel concluded that lowering plasma cholesterol
levels (specifically blood levels of low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol) will definitely reduce the risk of
heart attacks due to CHD. Serum lipoproteins are the
carriers for lipids in the circulation. They are
classified according to their density: chylomicrons, very
low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins
(LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Chylomicrons
mainly participate in transporting dietary triglycerides
and cholesterol from the intestine to adipose tissue and
liver. VLDL deliver endogenously synthesized triglycerides
from liver to adipose and other tissues. LDL transports
cholesterol to peripheral tissues and regulate endogenous
cholesterol levels in those tissues. HDL transports
cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver. Arterial
wall cholesterol is derived almost exclusively from LDL.
Brown and Goldstein, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 52, 223 (1983);
Miller, Ann. Rev. Med. 31, 97 (1980)). In patients with
low levels of LDL, the development of atherosclerosis is
rare. Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method for
reducing plasma cholesterol in patients with
hypercholesterolemia or at risk of developing
hypercholesterolemia.Elevated cholesterol
