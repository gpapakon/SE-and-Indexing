<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an installation for heating a premises (A, B) with one or more rooms in a building, which comprises a compressor (1) for compressing a coolant medium from a vaporization coil (2) which is coupled to the input side of the compressor (1) and which is disposed in a region (3) outside the premises (A, B) for thermal absorption from the surroundings, the output side of the compressor (1) being coupled to a coil (4) disposed in the premises (A, B) for condensing the coolant compressed in the compressor (1) and that the vaporization coil (2) is interconnected to the condensation coil (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an installation in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. Known heating installations have a relatively complicated construction 
which entails both high manufacturing costs and high 
installation costs. Moreover known heating installations entail 
highrunning costs in addition to which are primarily added the 
requisite energy consumDtion for the desired heat exchange. A 
previously known installation is disclosed in WO-A-9 106 811. One object of the present invention is to realize a new heating 
installation with improved properties than hitherto known heating 
installations. This object is satisfied according to the present invention in 
the installation disclosed in the introduction by employing therein 
the characterising features as set forth in one or more of 
the appended claims. Through the present invention there will be achieved a new  
 
heating installation which, in comparison with previously known 
heating installations has a simpler construction, which contributes 
in considerably lower costs than for known constructions. 
The simpler construction which is made possible through the 
present invention moreover also reduces maintenance and repair 
costs. Through the present invention pumps or fans will no 
longer be required, which entails lower energy consumption and 
thereby affords to the installation according to the present 
invention considerably higher energy and/or power factor than 
hitherto known heating installations. One embodiment of the present invention will be described more 
closely hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. 
Fig 1 is a skeleton diagram of one embodiment of a heating 
installation according to the present invention. Fig 2 shows a 
cross section along the line II-II in fig 1. Fig 3 shows a cross 
section along the line III-III in fig 1. The embodiment of a heating installation according to the present 
invention shown on the drawings is intended for heating a 
premises 5 with one or more rooms in a building which is defined 
by the lines A and B. These may also constitute defining lines 
for a flooring structure in the premises 5. In the flooring 
structure, there is disposed a pipe coil 4 whose input side is 
coupled to the output side from a compressor 1 which is located 
on the outside of the building A, B. The opposite end of the 
coil 4 relative to the compressor is coupled via a throttle 
member 6 to an outer pipe coil 2 whose opposite end relative to 
the throttle member 6 is coupled to the input side
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Installation for heating a premises (A, B) with one or more 
rooms in a building, which comprises a compressor (1) for compressing 

a coolant medium from a vaporization coil (2) which is 
coupled to the input side of the compressor (1) and which is 

disposed in a region (3) outside the premises (A, B) for thermal 
absorption from the surroundings, wherein the 

output side of the compressor (1) is coupled to a coil (4) 
disposed in the premises (A, B) for condensing the coolant 

compressed in the compressor (1), and wherein the vaporization coil 
(2) is interconnected to the condensation coil (4) 
characterized in that
 
the first part of the condensation coil (4) in the flooring 

structure (5) beneath the premises (A, B) is thermally insulated 
(7, 10) for counteracting transfer of heat from the same to the 

surroundings. 
Installation according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the 
thermal insulation is divided into a first part (7) closest to 

the compressor (1) and a second part (10) following thereon. 
Installation according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
thermal insulation (7) on the first part has greater thermal 

insulation capacity than the thermal insulation (10) on the 
second part. 
Installation according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that
 
the thermal insulation (7) is a plastic coating and a number of air layers (9) closest 

to the condensation coil (4) itself. 
Installation according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 the 
thermal insulation (10) on the second part is a plastic layer 

(11) direct on the condensation coil (4).
