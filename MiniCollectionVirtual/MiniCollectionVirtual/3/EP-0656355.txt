<ABSTRACT>
A biphenylmethane derivative represented by general formula (I), a salt thereof, and a remedy for circulatory system diseases 
containing the same, wherein A represents the group (II) or (III) wherein R¹ represents hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower cycloalkyl, 

optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted aralkyl, optionally substituted acyl, or amino acid residue; X 
represents oxygen or sulfur; Y represents nitrogen or =CR²-; Z represents oxygen, nitrogen or =CR³- (excluding the case 

where both of Y and Z represent nitrogen simultaneously); R² and R³ represent each independently hydrogen, halogen, optionally 
substituted lower alkyl, optionally protected carboxyl, lower cycloalkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkoxy, lower alkylthio 

or aryl, or alternatively R², R³ and the adjacent carbon atoms may be combined together to form an optionally substituted 
benzene ring; and B represents cyano, optionally protected carboxyl or optionally protected tetrazol-5-yl. This compound 

has such potent angiotensin II antagonism and hypotensive effect that it is useful for treating circulatory system diseases 
such as hypertension, cardiac diseases and cerebral apoplexy.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel biphenylmethane 
derivatives and salts thereof, said derivatives 
and salts having a potent angiotensin II antagonist activity 
and also having a powerful antihypertensive activity. Angiotensin II is an active center of the renin-angiotensin 
system, and has powerful vasopressor action 
and stimulating action for the synthesis and secretion 
of aldosterone in the adrenal cortex. It is also known 
to be a substance causing hypertension. Its action is 
considered to be caused through a specific receptor on 
various target organs such as adrenal cortex, kidneys, 
arterioles and the peripheries of sympathetic nerves. Known conventional examples of substances which 
shows an antihypertensive effect by pharmacological inhibition 
of the renin-angiotensin system include 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril 
and enarapril, angiotensin II antagonists and  
 
renin inhibitors. As angiotensin II antagonist out of 
these, saralasin ([Sar¹, Ala⁸] AGII), an angiotensin II 
type peptide, and nonpeptide derivatives such as imidazole 
derivatives (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 
7103/1981 and 71074/1981, and Japanese Language Laid-Open 
Publication (PCT) No. 501020/1991) and pyrazole 
derivatives (Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 218371/1991) 
are already known. The peptide derivatives, however, have difficulty 
in clinical applications because of their short in vivo 
half-life, lack of effectiveness upon oral administration 
and significant agonistic activities. Among the 
nonpeptide derivatives, none has been used clinically 
yet as drugs either. With a view toward providing a clinically excellent 
drug under such circumstances, the present inventors 
have carried out an extensive investigation. 
As a result, it has been found that novel biphenylmethane 
derivatives represented by the following formula 
(I) have an excellent angiotensin II antagonist 
activity and are useful as therapeutics for circulatory 
diseases such as hypertension, heart diseases and 
cerebral apoplexy, leading to the completion of the invention. The present invention relates to a biphenylmethane 
derivative represented by the following formula 
(I): 
wherein A represents a group 
in which R¹ represents a hydrogen atom, a lower alkyl 
group, a lower-cycloalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted 
phenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted 
aralkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted 
acyl group or an amino acid residue; X 
represents an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom or a group 
=CH-,
