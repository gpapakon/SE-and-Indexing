<ABSTRACT>
A front jaw for a safety binding has a housing (1) in which is arranged a preadjustable triggering spring which acts on two sole holders (2a, 2b) through a common, substantially vertical bolt (3) guided in the housing (1). The sole holders (2a, 2b) are designed each as a laterally swivellable one-armed lever. Both sole holders are in addition upwardly swivellable in the housing. Each sole holder (2a, 2b) is supported at its front side on the housing (1) on a substantially vertical and curved guiding surface (7a, 7b), seen from above, and can swivel around a virtual momentary axis of rotation (D). Each sole holder (2a, 2b) has at least one supporting surface (10a, 1b; 12a, 12b) associated with at least a complementary surface (11a, 11b; 13) fixed to the housing upon which the supporting surface (10a, 1b; 12a, 12b) can be supported when the sole holder is upwardly swivelled, creating a new virtual momentary axis of rotation (D') for each sole holder (2a, 2b) which lies between the polar curve (P) and the longitudinal mid-plane ( epsilon ).

<CLAIMS>
A front clamp assembly for a safety binding, comprising 
a housing (1) accommodating therein a pre-adjustable release 

spring acting on two sole clamps (2a,2b) through a single 
shaft (3) extending substantially vertical and guided in 

said housing (1), said sole clamps (2a,2b) being formed as 
one-armed levers mounted on said shaft for lateral pivoting, 

said two sole clamps and said shaft being further mounted in 
said housing for pivoting upwards, each sole clamp (2a,2b) 

taking support with its front side on a substantially vertical 
and - as viewed from above - arcuate guide surface (7a, 

7b) on said housing (1) and being adapted to pivot about an 
imaginary momentary pivot axis (D) defined by the intersection 

of a straight line (NA) extending perpendicular to said 
guide surface (7a,7b) at the point of contact therewith of 

said sole clamp (2a,2b), and a straight line (NZ) extending 
perpendicular to the longitudinal center plane (ε) of the 

front clamp assembly through the center (Z) of said shaft 
(3), and is displaced along a pole curve (P) in response to 

lateral pivoting of said sole clamp (2a,2b),
 
characterized in that each sole clamp (2a,2b) has at least 

one abutment face (10a,10b; 12a,12b) for cooperation with at 
least one support face (11a,11b; 13) on said housing (1) on 

which said at least one abutment face (10a,10b; 12a,12b) is 
adapted to take support as said sole clamp pivots upwards, 

to result in the generation of a new imaginary momentary 
pivot axis (D') defined by the intersection of a straight 

line (NA') extending perpendicular to said abutment face 
(10a,10b; 12a,12b) at the point of support and said straight 

line (NZ) extending perpendicular to said longitudinal 
center plane (ε) of the front clamp assemble through the 

center (Z) of said shaft (3), said pivot axis (D') being 
located between said pole curve (P) and said longitudinal 

center plane (ε), preferably in the immediate vicinity of 
said pole curve.  

 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 1, characterized 
in that said abutment face (10a,10b; 12a,12b) and 

said support face (11a,11b; 13) have sense of curvature 
- as viewed from above - as said guide face (7a,7b) for said 

sole clamps (2a,2b). 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that for limiting its pivotal displacement 

each sole clamp (2a,2b) has its upper side provided with a 
bearing head (8a,8b) adapted to take support on said housing 

(1) at a respective upwards recessed portion (9a,9b) formed 
thereon at a location rearwards of said guide surface (7a, 

7b), with the front end face of said bearing head (8a,8b) 
being formed as an abutment face (10a,10b), and the front 

end face of said recessed portion (9a,9b), as a support 
face (11a,11b). 
A front clamp assembly according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the clamp-down section (5a,5b) of each 

sole clamp (2a,2b) is formed with a forwards facing abutment 
face (12a,12b) at a location adjacent said longitudinal 

center plane (ε), with the upper rear housing boundary at 
this location being formed as a support face (13).
