<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clathrate
compound and, more particularly, to a novel clathrate
compound including a water-soluble microbicide, which
improves the handleability and the stability of the microbicide
therein.In water systems such as cooling water systems in
various factory plants or the pulp and paper industries,
slime of various bacteria, fungi, animals and vegetables
adheres to the ducts or lines to cause various troubles.Hitherto, for the purpose of preventing the
troubles to be caused by slime or the like in such
systems, a microbicide (slime-controlling agent) has
generally been employed as it may easily be handled and it
is relatively low-priced. For instance, 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one
of the following formula (I)
(hereinafter referred to as "Cl-MIT") is widely used as a
slime-controlling agent, a bactericide, an algicide or a
fungicide for various water systems such as a cooling
water system, a papermaking process system or a swimming
pool, as it has an excellent microbicidal activity. 
However, Cl-MIT is extremely stimulative to the
skin and a careful caution is necessary for handling the
same, though it has an excellent microbicidal activity.Since Cl-MIT decomposes extremely easily, water-soluble
microbicides on the market contain a large amount of Mg
salts so as to stabilize Cl-MIT therein. Therefore, such
commercial microbicides could not be employed in the field
of latex and emulsion which can not accept Mg salts.The Cl-MIT can be separated from
the water-soluble microbicides on the market by
extraction methods using organic solvents, but the thus-extracted
Cl-MIT is unstable especially under heat, so that
it decomposes within one or two days even at about of 40 °C.
For these reasons, special attention is needed to store the
compound such as storing it in a refrigerator. In order to overcome problems such as above, the present
applicant has already proposed clathrate compounds having a
water-soluble microbicide such as C1-MIT containing a host
compound such as bisphenol halide (Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Application No. 1-190602).Among the host compounds proposed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Application No. 1-190602, 2,2'-methylenebis(4-chlorophenol)
has been considered preferred.It is an object of the present invention to provide an
improved clathrate compound including a water-soluble microbicide
such as C1-MIT.The present invention provides a clathrate compound composed
of 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one as a water-soluble
microbicide and a phenolic
