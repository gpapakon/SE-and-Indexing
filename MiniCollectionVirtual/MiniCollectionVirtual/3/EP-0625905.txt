<ABSTRACT>
Described is a fragrancing composition having fragrancing components that are not activated until, e.g., application to the skin of a human. The composition is akaline or (if anhydrous) capable of producing an alkaline pH when in contact with water, prior to application, and includes (1) a vehicle for application of the composition, and (2) at least one potential fragrance that is at least one compound having little or no odor in the alkaline composition but which, e.g., is hydrolyzed in a lower pH environment to produce compounds having a relatively strong aroma. Upon application of the alkaline composition to the skin surface, the strong buffering capacity of the skin (the surface of which has a normal pH of 5.5-7.0) neutralizes alkalinity of the composition (lowers pH) so as to restore normal skin surface pH; the potential fragrance is then hydrolyzed at the lower pH to release the compound having relatively strong aroma.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions,
particularly compositions for contacting the skin (for example,
skin care compositions or personal care compositions), for
producing fragrances. More particularly, the present invention
relates to such compositions for contacting the skin, wherein
the fragrance is formed (e.g., is released from a compound
forming a component of the composition) after application of
the composition to the skin (that is, body activated
fragrances).It has been desired to provide personal care or skin care
products which have components that produce a low level of
odor, or are odorless, prior to application to the skin, but
which components produce compounds that are pleasant smelling
(that is, provides a fragrance) after application to the skin
(that is, delayed release of the fragrance). It is desired to
provide deodorant or antiperspirant stick products, hand
lotions, baby lotions, baby powders, ointments, foot products,
facial cleansers, body wipes, facial makeups, colognes, after-shave
lotions and/or shaving cream having such components. It
is also desired to provide personal care or skin care products
(particularly, a deodorant or antiperspirant stick product)
that are clear or transparent, and have fragrancing components
that, prior to application to the skin (e.g., application to 
the axillary regions), have a low degree of odor or are
odorless, but become pleasant smelling after application.Solid, transparent, gelled antiperspirant compositions,
containing one or more acidic reacting antiperspirant
compounds, are known. Note each of U. S. Patent No. 4,154,816
to Roehl, et al., and U. S. Patent No. 4,720,381 to Schamper,
et al., for example, the contents of each of which are
incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Each of
these U. S. patents discloses solid, transparent or clear,
antiperspirant gelled stick compositions including an
antiperspirant metal compound (such as aluminum clorohydrate),
and alcohols (both monohydric and polyhydric alcohols), with
sorbitol dibenzyl ether (DBMSA) utilized as a gelling agent.
Such antiperspirant sticks gelled with DBMSA as the gelling
agent are utilized as an alkaline or neutral media, but not as
an acidic media, since even in the presence of small amounts of
water DBMSA hydrolyzes in an acidic medium or will react with a
reactive alcohol to form a different acetal. Such
antiperspirant stick compositions containing DBMSA as the
gelling agent are also known to include conventional
fragrances, which begin volatilizing at

<CLAIMS>
A composition for imparting a fragrance, the composition being
capable of producing an alkaline pH when in contact with water, and including:


(1) a vehicle, and
(2) at least one potential fragrance, said potential fragrance being a compound
which has relatively little odor in the composition, but reacting in a more acidic

environment to produce a compound having a fragrance with a relatively strong aroma, said at least one potential
