<ABSTRACT>
An antibacterial sand in which individual particles are 
coated with an antibacterial inorganic material comprising 

an antibacterial metal or metal ion on an inorganic 
carrier. Use for a plant pathogenic germ such as 

Fusarium, Rhizoctonia, Sclerotinia and Pyshium as a 
pesticide. 
A coloured or white sand is coated with an antibacterial 
inorganic material carrying an antibacterial metal or 

metal ion (Ag, Cu or Zn) on an inorganic carrier at rate 
of from 0.1 to 50% using a silicon based binder and a 

curing agent with or without a perfume, colouring agent or 
animal repellent. The amount of the antibacterial 

inorganic material used is at least 0.1% with respect to 
the sand.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to antibacterial sand having a 
natural (white) colour and/or added colouring, and the use 
thereof against plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria. Recently, it has become a problem that children are 
infected with bacteria and roundworm owing to 
contamination of sandboxes with faeces and urine of a dog 
or cat. Sterilization and disinfection of the sand with a 
chemical agent, disinfection under high temperature and 
mixing with an antibacterial sand have been considered. 
However, there is a problem of the toxicity of the 
chemical agent used in the disinfection if present in the 
sterilization and disinfection under high temperature, and 
the effective period or life of the sand is relatively 
short. There is no practical apparatus for disinfection 
under the high temperature available. Accordingly, a sand coated with a solution containing an 
organic substance and silver ion having high antibacterial 
properties has been developed. The sand is heat-fired, an 
antibacterial membrane is formed on the suface, and the 
sand is mixed with a ceramic containing Ag. However, the 
heat-firing is expensive. On the other hand, when the 
sands are merely coated with Ag ions or a mixture of an 
organic substance and Ag ions, the Ag ions are peeled off 
and present a safety problem. Uniform dispersion on the 
sand is needed when applying a ceramic containing Ag. 
When antibacterial sands are used, the effective period is 
different. Depending on the use and its place, then 
overall life and period between changes vary. Plant growth is adversely affected by various bacteria,  
 
fungi and the microorganisms so pesticides are used in 
agriculture. However, no pesticide is known which is 
effective against all bacteria, fungi and microorganisms. 
No pesticide effective against plant pathogenic germs such 
as Rhizoctonia, Fusarium and Sclerotinia, by which turf, 
orchids and cyclamens are affected, is known which does 
not have adverse influences. Accordingly, a pesticide 
having high effect and being friendly to the environment 
is needed. The invention provides an antibacterial sand, in which 
individual particles are coated with an antibacterial 
inorganic material comprising antibacterial metal or metal 
ion on an inorganic carrier. A stable silicon compound, 
such as water glass or silane, and a curing agent therefor 
may be coated with the antibacterial inorganic material. 
Perfume, colouring agent and animal repellent also may 
coexist with the antibacterial inorganic material. Sand
