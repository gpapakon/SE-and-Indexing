Flexible sheath which can be opened longitudinally, internal 
support for natural casings, and is intended for transferring them 

onto carrier tube, characterised in that it consists of 
one or more flexible strips (1) of generally oblong shape 

whose two longitudinal opposite sides are straight and 
each have a projecting rib (2) or a hollow groove (3), 

complementary male and female elements of a longitudinal 
press closure (4), which is capable of being opened and 

closed a plurality of times. 
Flexible sheath according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that it consists of a single flexible strip 

(1) which is closed on itself by joining the two opposite 
sides which have the complementary closure elements (2, 

3) or of a plurality of flexible strips (1) connected 
together by complementarity of shape of the elements (2, 

3) of longitudinal closures (4) made on each longitudinal 
side of the various flexible strips (1). 
Flexible sheath according to one of Claims 1 and 
2, characterised in that it has an equal number of 

longitudinal closures (4) and flexible strips (1) which 
make it up. 
Flexible sheath according to one of Claims 1 to 
3, characterised in that the flexible strips (1) are 

inscribed in a rectangle of length between 10 and 70 cm, 
preferably between 20 and 40 cm, with a length to width 

ratio of between 2 and 40, preferably of between 10 and 

35. 
Flexible sheath according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that it consists of a single flexible 

strip (1).  
 
Flexible sheath according to one of Claims 1 to 
4, characterised in that it consists of a plurality of 

flexible strips (1). 
Flexible sheath according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that the flexible strips (1) are connected 

together by the male element (2) of one strip (1) joined 
to the female element (3) of another strip (1) so as to 

form the closure (4). 
Flexible sheath according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterised in that it can be opened easily by 

simple pulling on the sheath. 
Flexible sheath according to one of Claims 6 and 
7, characterised in that it can be opened easily by 

pulling on at least one of the strips (1) making up the 
sheath. 
Flexible sheath according to one of Claims 1 to 
9, characterised in that it is opened by applying a 

pulling force less than 0.03 N, preferably between 
0.005 N and 0.025 N, to at least one of the strips (1). 
Method for placing casings (5) used in butchery 
for sausage production onto a carrier tube (6), characterised 

in that a flexible sheath defined according to 
one of Claims 1 to 10, supporting the casings, is fitted 

over the carrier tube (6), then in that the flexible 
sheath is withdrawn by opening at least one of the 

longitudinal closures (4) by a pulling force generally 
parallel to the axis of the tube (6) on at least one of 

the strips (1) which make up the sheath.
