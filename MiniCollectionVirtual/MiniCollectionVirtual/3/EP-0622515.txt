<ABSTRACT>
A glass buffer for use in a double glazing panel is 
injection moulded of a resilient thermoplastic material 

such as a thermoplastic elastomer or thermoplastic 
rubber. The two components may be physically blended, 

e.g. a thermoplastic olefins (TPO), or reactively 
combined to form polymer alloys as in the thermoplastic 

vulcanisates and melt-processable rubbers. 
Thermoplastic urethanes (TPUs) can also be used.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to glass buffers, as used in 
glazing panels of the kind which incorporate two or more 
spaced panes of glass. For convenience, such glazing 
panels will simply be referred to below as "double 
glazing panels". In double glazing panels, an array of decorative 
plastics profiles and connecting keys are sometimes 
inserted between the panes of glass, to simulate a 
traditional georgian-style window for example. In order 
to stop the panes of glass from chattering against the 
enclosed profiles and/or keys, e.g. due to traffic 
vibrations, it is common to insert resilient buffers 
into the plastics components to contact the panes of 
glass and act as dampers. Existing glass buffers are transfer moulded using a slug 
of silicone rubber, but this material requires curing in 
the die for a significant period, resulting in a high 
cycle time and high component cost. An additional 
disadvantage of silicone rubber is that the colour range  
 
which can be achieved is very limited. An aim of the present invention may be viewed as being 
to reduce the manufacturing time and cost whilst 
retaining the functional attributes of existing glass 
buffers. The present invention proposes a glass buffer for use in 
a double glazing panel, which is injection moulded of a 
resilient thermoplastic material. The glass buffer of the invention does not require a 
long period of cooling before it can be removed from the 
mould. In addition, by using thermoplastics based 
materials as opposed to silicone rubbers a wide range of 
colours can be achieved with little or no fading. The preferred moulding material is a thermoplastic 
elastomer or thermoplastic rubber. Thermoplastic 
elastomers and rubbers have been commercially available 
since the 1960s. They are block copolymers comprising 
a hard thermoplastic and a resilient synthetic elastomer 
or natural rubber. The two components may simply be physically blended. An 
example of this group which is particularly useful in 
the present invention is the thermoplastic olefins 
(TPOs), which are a blend of a polyolefin and an uncured 
rubber component. On the other hand, the styrenics 
(which incorporate polystyrene) are less suitable since  
 
they are generally only suitable for low temperature 
applications. The components may also be reactively combined to form 
polymer alloys as in the thermoplastic vulcanisates and 
melt-processable rubbers, both of which can generally be 
used in the invention. A third group of thermoplastic elastomers which can be 
used
