<ABSTRACT>
A single cycle positioning system utilizing a three
phase wye connected induction motor (10) includes a

three phase inverter (28) and a microprocessor (20) for
controlling the inverter to generate three phases of

power. Pulse width modulation techniques are utilized
and in response to a start signal the frequency of the

power to the motor is increased up to a running
frequency, and in response to a stop signal the

frequency of the power applied to the motor is decreased
along with a corresponding reduction of the voltage

applied to the motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to positioning systems and,
more particularly, to an improved single cycle
positioning system which utilizes an induction motor to
accurately position a cyclicly movable member at a
precise location within its movement cycle according to
the preamble of claim 1.There are numerous machines where a member is
cyclicly driven and it is required to stop the member at
a precise location within its positional cycle. One
such type of machine is a crimping press which is
utilized repetitively to attach electrical terminals to
the ends of wires. U.S. Patent No. 3,343,398 discloses
one such machine wherein a ram is coupled to a shaft
and, during each single revolution of the shaft, the ram
is moved downwardly and then back to its initial
position thereby to move a crimping die on the end of
the ram into engagement with a terminal. The shaft is
coupled through a single revolution clutch to a flywheel
which is continuously driven by a continuously operated
motor. When it is desired to crimp a terminal onto a
wire, the single revolution clutch is engaged to drive
the shaft through a single revolution so that the ram is
moved through its cycle.While the aforedescribed arrangement is effective
for its intended purpose, it suffers from a number of
disadvantages. Thus, for example, the continuous
running of the motor is wasteful of electrical energy
and results in the generation of heat. Also, the use of
a single revolution clutch causes noise and vibration.
Further, the clutch has to be properly maintained and
worn parts replaced. WO 86 030 75 A discloses a single cycle positioning system in
accordance with the pre-characterizing part of claim 1. With regard to
the deceleration and stopping of the prior art system this prior art
document appears to suggest to control the deceleration by means of a
PWM control after receipt of a stop signal. Positioning systems utilizing servo motors are
known. However, due to the type of motor required, such
systems tend to be expensive. It is therefore another
object of the present invention to provide a positioning
system of the type described which utilizes a relatively
inexpensive induction motor.The first and additional objects are attained
in accordance with the principles of this invention by the features
of claim 1.The
control means is operative in response to the start
signal for applying AC power to the motor at a frequency 
which increases up to a predetermined frequency, and
thereafter maintaining the frequency of the AC power at
the predetermined
