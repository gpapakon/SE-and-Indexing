<ABSTRACT>
In this box structure for railway rolling stock, the side faces of which comprise structural profiled sections assembled together, such as two longitudinal members (2), two swing roof leaves (10), vertical posts (13, 13', 14), as many as possible of the structural profiled sections are made by assembling outer and inner open shells, respectively, assembled by plasma welding, the outer shell being thus capable of forming a visible part of the side face, these profiled sections being stretched to the plastic deformation range.

<CLAIMS>
A body for railway railing stock, whose lateral faces comprise structural profiles 
assembled together, such as two longitudinal bars (2), two top panels (10), vertical 

posts (13, 13', 14), some at least of which are produced by the welded assembly of 
open shells, respectively outer (13e) and inner (13i), the outer shell being in this way 

able to form a visible part of the lateral face, characterized in that the said profiles 
formed in this way are stretched up to the point of plastic deformation. 
A body as claimed in Claim 1, characterized in that the shells (13e, 13i) are 
assembled by plasma welding. 
A body as claimed in either Claim 1 or Claim 2, characterized in that the said 
profiles are stretched to the point of permanent appreciable deformation amounting to 

approximately 2% of the length of the profile. 
A body as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the said profiles 
formed in this way of several shells comprise the longitudinal bars (2), the top panels 

(10), the door lintels (12), the door posts (13) and the bay piers (14). 
A body as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the body is 
intended for a two-level coach, and the longitudinal bars comprise a lowered central 

portion of two shells (102e, 102i) connected with end portions of three shells (202e, 
202i, 202j). 
A body as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 5, characterized in that some at least 
of the profiles comprise stiffeners (16) disposed between the shells. 
A body as claimed in any of Claims 1 to 6, characterized in that holes are 
provided in the inner shells.
