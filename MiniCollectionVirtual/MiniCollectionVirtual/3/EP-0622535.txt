<ABSTRACT>
The work produced by the gas turbine expander (40), is improved by 
cooling a nitrogen product (86)
, produced by a cryogenic 
air separation unit (80), to a subambient temperature and 

combining this subambient cooled, nitrogen product (92) 
with the feed air stream (10) prior to compression (20). 

The cooling can be produced by expanding (90) the nitrogen 
product (86) and/or saturating it with water (Fig 2;190). 

The present invention is particularly suited to a process 
in which at least a portion of the oxygen product (84) 

produced by the cryogenic air separation unit (80) is 
reacted with a carbonaceous feedstock (72) in a 

gasification unit (70) to produce the fuel gas.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas turbine process 
for the production of work to generate electricity or to 
drive a device. More specifically, the present invention 
relates to a process for using the nitrogen from a 
cryogenic air separation process as a feed gas to the air 
compressor of the gas turbine in the gas turbine process. Oxygen-blown gasification of a carbonaceous feedstock, 
for example coal, petroleum coke, residual oil, oil 
emulsions, and tar sands in gasification combined cycle 
(GCC) power plants generate a large flow of excess nitrogen 
associated with the production of oxygen feed for the 
gasification reaction. One difficulty confronting industry 
is to make the most efficient use of this effectively free 
excess nitrogen in the GCC facility. Other related 
difficulties in GCC technology include the continuing drive 
for more generating capacity at increasingly greater 
efficiencies and the imposition of severe limits on NOx 
emissions to the atmosphere. Further, as existing GCC 
facilities' capacity, efficiency, and NOx emission rates 
become inadequate to meet increasingly strict future 
demands, there is a need for inexpensive retrofitting 
modifications to meet these new, more stringent 
requirements. The present invention allows the use of the 
available excess nitrogen in a GCC power plant to increase 
power generation capacity and improve power generation 
efficiency with minimum additional capital costs in both 
new grass roots plants and in re-powering/ retrofitting 
applications. There are several methods for utilizing nitrogen in a 
GCC power plant. The simplest method is to vent the excess  
 
nitrogen to the atmosphere. The simple venting of the 
nitrogen is employed when minimum integration or no 
integration between the air separation unit and the gas 
turbine is desired. Another method is described in GB-A-2,067,668. This 
method consists of returning the excess nitrogen at 
unspecified temperature to the inlet of the gas turbine air 
compressor with the sole expressed purpose of reducing NOx 
generation. This same method is also disclosed in US-A-4,297,842. Still another method is to pass the nitrogen through 
an auxiliary compressor to inject it into the gas turbine 
fuel stream which reduces NOx generation by reducing the 
flame temperature in the combustor. This practice is 
disclosed in US-A-5,081,845, EP-A-0,137,152 and US-A-4,224,045. 
This method requires a costly auxiliary 
compression system, so, implementation is expensive. Also, 
since nitrogen
