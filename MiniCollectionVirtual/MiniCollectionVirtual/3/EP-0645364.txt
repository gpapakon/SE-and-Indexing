<ABSTRACT>
Carbonates having aromatic ester groups can be prepared by reaction of aromatic monohydroxy compounds with phosgene or with chlorocarboxylic acid esters of aromatic monohydroxy compounds, the reaction being carried out at a temperature in the range from 50 to 350 DEG C in the presence of oxides of the metals from group IV B of the Periodic Table of the Elements according to Mendeleev as heterogeneous catalysts.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of aryl carbonates by the
reaction of aromatic monohydroxy compounds with

phosgene or chloroformic acid esters of aromatic
monohydroxy compounds, characterised in that the

reaction is performed at a temperature in the range
from 50 to 350Â°C at a pressure of 0.2 to 20 bar in the

presence of one or more oxide(s) of titanium,
zirconium or hafnium as heterogeneous catalysts.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the catalysts used are one or more oxide(s) of

titanium, zirconium or hafnium having surface areas
determined using the BET method of 2 to 500 m
2
/g in
quantities of 0.5 to 100 wt.%, relative to the

quantity of monohydroxy compound, in the case of a not
completely continuous mode of operation, or at

loadings of 0.1 to 20 g of monohydroxy compound per g
of catalyst per hour in the case of a completely

continuous mode of operation.
