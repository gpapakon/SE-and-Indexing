<ABSTRACT>
Plural indoor units (3a,3b,3c) containing indoor heat 
exchangers (13a,13b,13c) and electric expansion valves 

(14a,14b,14c) are linked in parallel to an outdoor unit (2) 
containing compressors (4,5) and an outdoor heat exchanger (7). 

In addition, capillary tubes (16a,16b,16c) are provided in 
parallel to the expansion valves (14a,14b,14c) respectively, and 

the resistance value of the capillary tubes is set to be smaller 
than the resistance value corresponding to the opening degree of 

the expansion valves when the room heating operation is stopped. 
With this construction, occurrence of noise of refrigerant can 

be suppressed not only when a room heating operation is 
performed, but also when the room heating operation is stopped, 

by allowing refrigerant to flow into an indoor heat exchanger 
even during the stop of the room heating operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multiroom air conditioner or 
heat-pump type air conditioner for blowing out heat-exchanged 
air. In the air conditioner, there has been known a multiroom air 
conditioner in which plural indoor units each having an indoor 
heat-exchanger and an electric expansion valve are linked in 
parallel to a single outdoor unit having a compressor and an 
outdoor heat-exchanger. This type of air conditioner is disclosed 
in U.S. Patent No. 5,222,371, for example. In this type of air conditioner, condensed liquid 
refrigerant is frequently trapped in an indoor heat exchanger 
when an electric expansion valve is completely closed at the stop 
time of a room heating operation or the like. Therefore, the air 
conditioner falls into a gas-lacking state, and thus reduction 
in capacity is unavoidable. In order to avoid this problem, even 
when the room heating operation is ceased, the electric 
expansion valve is kept opened with smaller opening degree than 
that during the room heating operation, thereby preventing the 
trap of the refrigerant in the indoor heat-exchanger when the 
room heating operation is ceased.  
 As described above, the electric expansion valve is kept 
somewhat opened, so that the sound of refrigerant occurs in the 
expansion valve to induce noise. Particularly with respect to the 
electric expansion valve, the valve opening degree of the 
electric expansion valve is controlled by an electric motor 
(pulse motor), and thus there is a fact that it is difficult to 
accurately set the valve opening degree to a desired value due 
to a rotation error of the motor, etc. In addition, there is 
another fact that gas-liquid mixed refrigerant flows through the 
expansion value during the room heating operation and during the 
stop of the room heating operation. The sound (noise) of the 
refrigerant as described above is extremely magnified by a 
multiplied effect of these facts. EP-A-0 364 834 discloses an air conditioner having an outdoor 
unit containing a compressor and an outdoor heat exchanger 
and plural indoor units having both of an indoor 
heat exchanger and an electric expansion valve, 
wherein the compressor, the outdoor heat exchanger, the 
electric expansion valve and the indoor heat exchanger are 
linked to another in this order to constitute a refrigerant 
circuit, and wherein the expansion valve is provided with 
the pressure reducing member which is linked to the electric 
expansion valve parallel to the refrigerant circuit.

An air conditioner having an outdoor unit (2) containing 
a compressor (4, 5) and an outdoor heat exchanger 

(7) therein, and plural indoor units (3a, 3b, 3c), each of 
these having both of an indoor heat exchanger (13a, 13b, 

13c) and an electric expansion valve (14a, 14b, 14c), 
wherein the compressor (4, 5), the outdoor heat exchanger 

(7), the electric expansion valve (14a, 14b, 14c) and the 
indoor heat exchanger (13a, 13b, 13c) are linked to one 

another in this order to constitute a refrigerant circuit, 
and the opening degree of the electric expansion valve 

(14a, 14b, 14c) of an indoor unit (3a, 3b, 3c) when a room 
heating operation is stopped being set to be smaller than 

the opening degree of the electric expansion valve (14a, 
14b, 14c) of the indoor unit (3a, 3b, 3c) when the room 

heating operation is conducted,
 
wherein said expansion valve (14a, 14b, 14c) is 

provided with a pressure reducing member (16a, 16b, 16c) 
which is linked to the electric expansion valve (14a, 14b, 

14c) in parallel in the refrigerant circuit and serves as 
resistance to refrigerant flowing therethrough. 
The air conditioner as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
each of said indoor units (3a, 3b, 3c) has a by-pass pipe 

(15a, 15b, 15c) serving as a by-pass for said electric expansion 
valve and said heat exchanger, and said pressure 

reducing member (16a, 16b, 16c) is disposed in said by-pass 
pipe.  

 
An air conditioner according to claim 1 including a 
four-way change-over valve (6) in said refrigerant circuit; 


a refrigerant flow direction being reversed through a 
switching operation thereof, and 
an auxiliary pressure reducing member (18a, 18b, 18c) 
for compensating for the resistance value of said electric 

expansion valve (14a, 14b, 14c) provided between said electric
