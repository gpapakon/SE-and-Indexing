transferring the products (X) from the pick-up station (P2) towards a delivery station 
(P3) defined generally above the pick-up station (P2), and a second transport mechanism 

(5) for receiving the products (X), which have been transferred to the delivery station 
(P3) by the lifter mechanism (4), and transporting the products (X) towards a stand-by 

station (P4) defined above a loading station (P5) at which the bagged products are 
loaded into the receptacle (Y). The lifter mechanism (4) is provided with a holding unit 

(66 to 69) for holding the products (X) transported to the stand-by station (P4) and a 
rotary drive unit (60) for rotating the holding unit (66 to 69) to turn the products (X) 

upside down during the transfer of such products (X) from the pick-up station (P2)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a transport apparatus 
according to the preamble of claim 1. The invention further relates to a package 
transporting and loading system. An example of a packaging machine for packaging or bagging food items or industrial 
machine parts is disclosed in, for example, the Japanese Laid-open (Unexamined) Utility 
Model Publication No. 60-171803 published November 14, 1985. This known packaging 
machine is of a design capable of performing a series of bag making, filing products into 
each bag and successively sealing the bags. More specifically, this packaging machine 
performs a process of folding a web of film, made of synthetic resin and drawn from a 
film roll disposed rearwardly upwardly of the body of the packaging machine, along a 
mid center line to bring opposite side edges thereof together, fusion-bonding the 
overlapping side edges of the web of film together (vertical sealing) to provide a tubular 
film, intermittently transporting the tubular film in a direction conforming to the longitudinal 
axis of the tubular film while sandwiching it in a direction widthwise thereof, and 
thermally sealing the tubular film at the sandwiched area (transverse or cross sealing) 
to provide a series of bags. By successively filling products into each bag through an 
upper open mouth thereof while the tubular film is intermittently transported with 
sandwiched at a lower portion in a direction widthwise, the bags of products filled 
therein can be successively manufactured. The bagged products manufactured by this 
known packaging machine are subsequently discharged from a front of the body of the  
 
packaging machine downwardly and, after the discharged bagged products have been 
loaded into a receptacle, for example, a carton box, in unit of a plurality of bags of 
products, the carton box is packaged and baled for shipment to the market. When it comes to a filing the bagged products, such as manufactured by 
the above described packaging machine or the like, into a receptacle such as a carton 
box, it is a general practice to allow the bagged products to fall downwardly towards the 
carton box along a downwardly inclined chute. The downwardly inclined chute is 
effective in that, where each bagged product has a substantial weight such as, for 
example, a bag of salt or sugar, the bagged products can slide downwardly along the 
chute stably under the influence of a gravitational force without substantially displacing 
in position and posture and be finally seated properly
