<ABSTRACT>
A control arrangement, particularly for the control of a fuel supply, includes an operator controlled command means (70) operatively connected with a fuel control member such as a throttle valve (64a) to position the member against the action of a first resilient bias (67). An independently signalled actuator (80) is operable to override the operator's setting of the command means (70) and a further resilient biasing means (104) disposed between the actuator (80) and the command means acts in concert with the first resilient bias (67) to exert a compensatory load on the command means (70) when the actuator is operating such that the total resilient load acting on the command means remains substantially constant whether or not the actuator (80) is operating to override the command means (70).

<DESCRIPTION>
 FUEL SUPPLY CONTROLThis invention relates to a control arrangement particularly, though not exclusively, for the control of a fuel supply for an internal combustion engine whereby the amount of fuel supplied to the engine is variable.Under different circumstances the amount of fuel supplied can vary the engine speed and/or the output torque delivered by the engine.The control arrangement of the invention is applicable to a fuel supply control comprising fuel supply means operable to vary the amount of fuel supplied in response to force transmitted to the fuel supply means by an operator controlled command means such as a cable slidably extending in a guide sheath, the cable and sheath forming a flexible coupling.Typically in such an arrangement one end of the cable is connected with the fuel supply means and the other end of the cable is connected to an accelerator pedal or lever which moves the cable in response to driver demand. Up to a predetermined limit, the greater the cable movement the greater is the amount of fuel supplied. The control includes restoring means 

acting in opposition to the force applied to move the cable, so that when the latter decreases the effect of the restoring means is to cause a decrease in the amount of fuel supplied. The restoring means is typically a spring means.In some semi-automatic transmission control systems for vehicles it is desirable for the vehicle throttle to be operated independently of driver demand.Such a fuel supply control for a motor vehicle having an internal combustion engine, comprises a throttle control valve, a cable connected to the control valve and which is operable to move the throttle valve in one direction to increase fuel supply to the engine, and in a return direction to decrease the fuel supply, a control unit which senses the throttle valve condition, and a hydraulic actuator responsive to the control unit to move the throttle control valve independently of the cable. The hydraulic actuator is secured to an end of the cable adjacent the throttle control valve and is operable to vary the effective length of the cable.Such a control system is disclosed in our 

co-pending application GB9304484.0.A problem associated with such a system is that when the throttle valve is closed independantly of the accelerator pedal controlled cable, the driver will perceive a change in load at the accelerator pedal. The present invention provides a means of ensuring that the driver feels no load change at the accelerator pedal .Accordingly there is

CLAIMS
1. A control arrangement operable to position a member (64a) and which includes a command means (70) operatively connected with the member to position the member against the action of a first resilient bias (67), and an independently signalled actuator (80) which acts to overide the command means (70), the arrangement being characterised by the provision of a further resilient biasing means (104) disposed between the actuator (80) and the command means to act in concert with the first resilient bias (67) to exert a compensatory load on the command means (70) when the actuator is operating such that the total resilient load acting on the command means remains substantially constant whether or not the actuator (80) is operating to overide the command means ( 70) .
2. A control arrangement as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in that the command means comprises an operator controlled means (70) and the actuator means (80) when operating overides the operator's intention. 


3. A control arrangement as claimed in Claim 2 characterised in that the operator controlled means is a manually operated control cable (70).
4. A fuel supply control for a motor vehicle which includes a control arrangement as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 , characterised in that said member is a throttle control valve (64a) for a internal combustion engine ( ) .

7. A fuel supply control as claimed in Claim 6 , characterised in that the operator control means (70) is connected with the throttle control valve (64a) or injection pump through a three bar linkage (100), a first bar of which is connected to the operator control means (70), a third bar (103) of which is connected to the throttle control valve (64a) or injector pump, and a second bar of which interlinks the first (101) and third (103) bars.
8.
