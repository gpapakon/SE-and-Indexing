<ABSTRACT>
Novel peptides of the invention are dynorphin analogues and have similar activity to endogenous dynorphin, but are des-Tyr or des-Tyr-Gly with respect to endogenous dynorphin. The novel peptides have therapeutic uses, such as administration to a host tolerant to a narcotic analgesic in order to potentiate activity of the narcotic analgesic and/or to block withdrawal symptoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DES-TYR DYNORPHIN ANALOGUESField of the Invention:The present invention generally relates to dynorphin analogues, and more particularly to novel dynorphin analogues that can be used with narcotic analgesics, such as opiate alkaloids. This invention was made with government support under Grant No. NIDA- 02643 awarded by the National Institutes of Health. The Government has certain rights in this invention.Background of the Invention;The endogenous opioids exist in multiple forms in the central nervous system and include the dynorphins, which are a series of peptides derived from the precursor prodynorphin (proenkephalin B) . The first of the dynorphins to be isolated was the 17 amino acid peptide having the structure shown (and designated SEQ ID N0:1) , sometimes also referred to as "dynorphin A (1- 17)":Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Leu-Arg-Arg-I1e-Arg-Pro-Lys- Leu-Lys-Trp-Asp-Asn-Gln (SEQ ID N0:1)Unlike either the enkephalins or the endorphins, many of the dynorphins interact with high affinity with all three major opioid receptor types (μ, S , and K) . The dynorphins are also nearly unique among endogenous 

opioids in that they are not analgesic in the brain, although they may be in the spinal cord.Smith and Lee have recently reviewed the pharmacology of dynorphin in Ann. Rev. Pharmacol . Toxicol . , 28 , pp. 123-140 (1988) . They note a growing body of evidence has indicated that endogenous opioids are closely connected with function of the immune system. The reviewers, however, state that dynorphin had not been tested in any of the studies reviewed, except for one study concerning mononuclear cell chemotaxis. However, the reviewers note that dynorphin has been implicated in tumor formation.Several U.S. patents have suggested uses of dynorphin. U.S. Patent 4,361,553, issued November 30, 1982, inventors Loh and Lee, set out the sequence of the first thirteen peptides for the naturally occurring dynorphin (containing seventeen amino acids) , which had been discovered to have potent agonist properties in guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens. This patent describes the discovery that dynorphin, and particularly dynorphin A (1-13) has an opposite effect in hosts tolerant to narcotic analgesic than the effect which has been observed in naive animals (an inhibition of morphine or β-endorphin-induced analgesia) . Thus, dynorphin A (1-13) potentiates the analgesic effect in tolerant hosts. Dynorphin was found useful in conjunction with a narcotic analgesic in order to reduce the amount of narcotic analgesic
