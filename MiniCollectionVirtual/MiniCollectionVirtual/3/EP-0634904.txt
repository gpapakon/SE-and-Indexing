Device for automatic and instantaneous pressurized 
percolation of liquid foodstuffs, especially hot drinks such as 

coffee, consisting of a mechanical unit (1), removable without 
tooling, constructed from functional sections forming at least 

one fixed rail (4) and including a compression piston (7) 
moving horizontally in an infusion chamber (5) with mobile 

bottom (11) extended by a filling chamber (12) which is 
horizontally mobile jointly with the mobile bottom (11), and 

fitted with an upper opening (13) for receiving a coffee powder 
discharge directly, this being evacuated by a rake (14), a 

boiler (2) for producing hot water being attached to the 
mechanical unit (1) and connected to the infusion chamber (5) 

by quick connectors (15), all the mobile devices being operated 
by a drive unit (3) with reverse drive causing the movement of 

a main rack (8) and a secondary rack (9) in opposing 
directions, the latter acting on the filling chamber (12) and 

the mobile bottom (11), so as to allow filling of the infusion  

 
chamber (5), compression of the percolation products and their 

evacuation in succession,
 
   characterized in that the infusion chamber (5) and mobile 

part (6) slide on a fixed rail (4), the latter bearing a 
compression piston (7) and driving the main rack (8) which is 

joined to it, this actuating the secondary rack (9) in the 
opposite direction through a pinion wheel (10) joined to the 

fixed rail (4), the filling chamber (12) and the mobile bottom 
(11) also sliding on the fixed rail (4) and being joined 

between them by a rod (17) whose position and profile are 
determined to control the movement of the rake (14), the latter 

pivoting in the vertical plane perpendicular to the axis of the 
infusion chamber (5) around a horizontal pivot (18) carried by 

the chamber. 
Device as per claim 1 characterized in that a mobile 
bottom (11) and the rod (17) joined to the filling chamber (12) 

are fixed on a mobile stop (22) situated at the rear of the 
infusion chamber (5) and sliding on the fixed rail (4) through 

the action on the one hand of the secondary rack (9) and on the 
other by an articulated hook (21) carried by a mobile part (6) 

which clicks onto a spigot (23) on the said mobile stop. 
Device as per any one of the aforesaid claims 
characterized in that the functional sections are light alloy 

or reinforced synthetic material extrusions. 
Device as per claims 1 and 2 characterized in that the 
functional sections are moulded in light alloy or reinforced 

synthetic material.  
 
Device as per any one of the aforesaid claims 
characterized in that the boiler (2) is situated immediately 

below the mechanical unit (1) and connected to the infusion 
chamber (5) by quick connect coupling (15) for water injection 

and evacuation of infused coffee and that a movable pour 
element (20) is fitted on the front of the said boiler and 

designed so that when installed it locks the mechanical unit 
(1) on the latter. 
Device as per any one of claims 1 to 4 characterized in 
that the boiler (2) is placed behind the mechanical unit (1) 

and connected to the infusion chamber (5) by a quick connect 
coupling (15) for water injection, evacuation of infused coffee 

taking place directly by a pipe directed towards the front. 
Device as per claim 6 characterized in that connection to 
the open air takes place by a longitudinal channel in the 

mobile bottom drive rod (11), extended in order to penetrate 
into a hollow of a fixed stop joined to the fixed rail (4) 

situated beyond the mobile stop (22) and arranged so that the 
end of the said drive rod is made leaktight by engaging in the 

said hollow during percolation, and is released by allowing the 
air to pass when the mobile bottom moves to cause expulsion of 

the infused powder. 
Device as per any one of the aforesaid claims 
characterized in that the drive unit (3) consists of a motor 

(24) driven by reduction gearing (25), a screw (26) with a 
tapped catch (27) which is inserted into a housing (28) 

provided to this effect in the mobile part (6) of the 
mechanical unit (1), the screw (26) being capable of axial  

 
movement in both directions and being normally maintained in a 

midway position by two springs (29) exerting force on a bearing 
fitted in a block (30) joined to the frame of the drive unit 

and situated at one end of the said screw, this carrying at its 
other end the mobile element of a proximity sensor (31) which 

controls reverse operation or stop of the motor in case of an 
anomaly when the catch (27) reaches the end of its travel, 

leading to axial displacement of the screw (26). 
Device as per claim 8 characterized in that different 
mechanical unit devices are arranged so that the order of 

startup causes firstly movement of the catch (27) which drives 
the mobile part (6) so that the compression piston (7) pushes 

the coffee powder, previously poured into the filling chamber 
(12), into the infusion chamber (5) and compresses it in the 

latter, the resistance encountered by the compression piston 
then stopping the motor, coffee infusion, and then reverse 

operation and movement, through the articulated hook (21), the 
mobile stop (22), the rod (27) and the mobile bottom (11), 

towards the front of the infusion chamber (5), together with 
moving apart of the filling chamber (12), rod (27) carrying a 

narrowing (32) to allow the rake (14) to be lowered under the 
force of a spring when the mobile bottom has reached the front 

of the infusion chamber, the articulated hook (21) being then 
raised through a ramp (33) joined to the fixed rail (4) and no 

longer driving the mobile stop, the mobile part (6) then 
bringing the secondary rack (9) into contact with the mobile 

stop (22) which is pushed towards its initial position at the 
same time as the filling chamber (12), the mobile bottom (11) 

and the rake (14).  
 
Device as per claim 9 characterized in that the mobile 
stop (22) is designed in order to, at the start of its 

movement, lower the cam (34) fitted on the boiler (2) and 
acting on valve (35) in order to connect the hot water feed 

circuit to the open air so as to avoid wetting the infused 
coffee powder, and thereby facilitating its evacuation. 
Device as per any one of claims 1 to 7 characterized in 
that the drive unit (3) consists of a dual action hydraulic 

cylinder operated by pressurized water from the pump also 
supplying the water for infusing the coffee, and that the 

hydraulic cylinder position and the quantity of water to be 
infused are controlled through a single decimetre associated 

with a programmable system actuating the solenoid valves. 
Device as per any one of the aforesaid claims, 
characterized in that the passage of the hot water takes place 

by two series of peripheral perforations distributed each one 
on 360° in the infusion chamber (5) and axially offset so as to 

cause progression of the water parallel to the axis of the said 
infusion chamber.
