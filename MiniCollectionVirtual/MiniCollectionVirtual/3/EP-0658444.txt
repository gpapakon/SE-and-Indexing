<ABSTRACT>
A thermal transfer recording medium comprising a 
foundation, and a release layer and a heat-meltable 

colored ink layer provided on the foundation in that 
order, the release layer containing 50 to 100 % by weight 

of a polyethylene wax having a melting or softening point 
of not lower than 100 °C, the heat-meltable colored ink 

layer comprising a coloring agent and a vehicle, the 
vehicle containing 50 to 100 % by weight of carnauba 

wax. The recording medium gives clear print images having 
excellent fastness without causing falling of ink and is 

useful for bar code printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal 
transfer recording medium. More particularly, it relates 
to a thermal transfer recording medium favorably used for 
forming print images such as bar codes for which fastness 
such as abrasion resistance or scratch resistance is 
required. Heretofore there was known a thermal transfer 
recording medium comprising a foundation having thereon a 
heat-meltable colored ink layer wherein an undercoating 
layer (release layer) composed predominantly of a resin 
and/or a wax is interposed between the foundation and the 
heat-meltable colored ink layer, thereby improving the 
transferability and preventing the obtained print images 
from smearing due to protection of them with the release 
layer (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 
147292/1990). EP-A-542 208 discloses a thermal transfer recording medium comprising a 
foundation, a release layer and a heat-meltable colored ink layer provided 
on the foundation in that order, the release layer optionally containing 
polyethylene wax and the thermofusible colored ink layer comprising a 
coloring agent and the vehicle, the vehicle optionally containing carnauba 
wax. However, the specific melting or softening point of the polyethylene 
wax and the amount thereof contained in the release layer and the specific 
amount of carnauba wax according to the present invention and the effects 
thereof are not disclosed in this document.  
 However, the present inventor's research 
revealed that it was difficult to meet both clearness and 
fastness required for bar codes by simply providing the 
release layer between the foundation and the heat-meltable 
colored ink layer. An object of the present invention is to provide 
a thermal transfer recording medium capable of forming 
print images which particularly meet both clearness and 
fastness required for bar codes. This and other object of the present invention 
will become apparent from the description hereinafter. The present invention provides a thermal 
transfer recording medium comprising a foundation, and a 
release layer and a heat-meltable colored ink layer 
provided on the foundation in that order, the release 
layer containing 50 to 100 % by weight of a polyethylene 
wax having a melting or softening point of not lower than  
 
100 °C, the heat-meltable colored ink layer comprising a 
coloring agent and a vehicle, the vehicle containing 50 to 
100 % by weight of carnauba wax. Fig. 1 is a schematic view illustrating a test 
method for evaluating "falling of ink" of
