<ABSTRACT>
A surgical needle for sutural treatment having a body and a blunt 
needle point has a blunt ratio of special range. The blunt ratio is defined 

as a ratio of diameter D2 of the needle point to diameter D1 of the body 
and set in a range between 0.04 and 0.30. The surgical needle having 

special blunt ratio is capable of preventing health providers from hurting 
themselves by mistake even if the needle contacts the tissues of the health 

providers and of providing a property that once the needle enters the 
tissues the needle passes through the tissues smoothly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application claims priority benefits under 35 U.S.C §119 of 
Japanese application Serial No. 5-111,156, filed April 15 th, 1993, the 
entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. This invention relates to a surgical needle for a suture and, more 
particularly, to a surgical needle having a blunt point. As conventional surgical needles, known are needles such as 
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication, No. Showa-63-34,649 
and Japanese Patent Publication, No. Heisei-5-18,576, and such as 
disclosed, as needles having a triangle cross section, in Japanese Utility 
Model Publication, No. Showa-62-23,457 and Japanese Patent 
Publication, No. Heisei-1-54,075. Many inventions are thus 
accomplished for reducing resistance against penetration of surgical 
needles when passed through the tissues. Problems of infections among health providers and patients 
involved in infectious diseases, such as hepatitis, AIDS, MRSA 
(Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus), and whatever, are raised 
as major social problems these days. Such infections may happen by way  
 
of fluid, such as blood or the like, as carriers when health providers, 
such as doctors or the like, hurts themselves by mistake with the medical 
instrument. Hence, a needle with a sharp point may hurt health providers 
by themselves, and the health providers must pay close attention to handle 
the needle since in such situations the health providers have to take 
tremendous risks of infection between them, so that the health providers 
have to endure enormous mental pressure upon such risks. On the other hand, in order to increase entry resistance of a 
surgical needle at a time that the point of the needle is pushed onto a skin, 
a blunt point of the needle is desirable. To the contrary, the blunt point 
can increase penetration resistance when the needle passes the tissues, so 
that the needle becomes difficult to handle. It is an object of the invention to provide a safe surgical needle 
hardly to hurt a health provider even if the provider handles it in a 
wrong manner and thereby to solve the problems happening in 
association with medical circumstances these days. The foregoing object is accomplished with a surgical needle having 
a body taperingly extending and a needle point provided at one end of the 
body and formed to be blunt so that the needle point does not enter into 
tissues unless predetermined force or above is applied thereto. The body 
and the needle point are formed so as to satisfy a ratio of
