<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed generally to
portable diagnostic systems based on electrochemical
determinations in biological samples in which the control
of sample temperature is important to analytical accuracy.
More particularly, the invention concerns a sampling unit
for controlling the temperature of a sample held in a removable disposable
cartridge. The sampling unit, or diagnostic
system, may be portable. The system of the invention achieves rapid heating to and accurate
control at a predetermined set point without the need for
contact between any temperature measuring device and the
disposable cartridge unit itself.Methods and devices utilized for determining
concentrations of electroactive species in solution using
electrochemical or electrolytic methods such as, for
example, the determination of pO2, pCO2 and electrolytes in
blood samples, are well known. These instruments typically
include a pair of electrochemical half cells, one of which
is used as the sensor or sample half cell and the other as
a reference electrode or a reference half cell. As is the
case with any concentration determination of dissolved
gaseous species in a liquid, the temperature at which the
electrochemical determination is made needs to be known.
Traditionally, blood gas determinations, for example, have
been made utilizing permanently installed laboratory
instrumentation to which samples are brought for analysis.
Of course, in such instruments the temperature at which the
sample is analyzed can be readily controlled as by a
constant temperature oven, or the like. This, of course,
is not practical in the case of a small portable device.Thus, there remains a need for an inexpensive approach
to controlling the sample temperature in a portable blood
gas analyzer or other such instrument that is easily
manufactured and rapidly stabilizing and accurate. 
Accordingly, it is a primary object of the present
invention to provide a sampling unit which is
simple, reacts rapidly and accurately controls sample
temperature.It is a further object of the present invention to
provide in the unit a non-contact temperature measurement system,
so that prolonged or repeated
use will not physically wear components to a state of
unreliability.These and other objects will become apparent to those
skilled in the art in accordance with the descriptions and
drawings herein.The present invention provides an accurate, low cost
sampling unit, usable for a portable medical
diagnostic device or other portable electrochemical
analytical device

<CLAIMS>
A sampling unit for controlling the temperature of a sample and
comprising a temperature control device (10) and a disposable cartridge

(22),

A. the cartridge (22) comprising:

i) a chamber (48) for containing a sample volume; and
ii) a sensor substrate (42) having oppositely disposed first and
second surfaces, the first surface being in contact in use with a sample in

the chamber (48), the sensor substrate further carrying an integral
electrical heater element (52);
B. the temperature control device comprising:

iii) mounting means (34) for removably receiving the
disposable cartridge (10) and including connector means (18) for

connecting electrical conductor means (26,28) to the heater element (52)
in the cartridge (22) for conducting electrical energy to the heater

element;
iv) temperature sensing means (30) for sensing the
temperature of the second surface (60) of the sensor substrate (42) without

direct contact with the cartridge (22) or direct exposure to the heating
element (52) itself and generating an electrical signal related to the sensed

temperature; and
v) control means for controlling the electrical input to the
heater element (52) based on the sensed temperature and a desired control

temperature.

element (52) is a resistance heater.
The apparatus of Claim 3 wherein the electrical heater element (52)
is a thick film resistor and the sensor substrate (42) is a dielectric chip.
The apparatus of Claim 1 or 2 wherein the first surface carries
electrochemical cell means and is opposite to the second surface (60).
The apparatus of Claim 4 wherein the heater element (52) is on the
first surface, which is opposite the second surface (60).
