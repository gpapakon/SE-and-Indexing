<ABSTRACT>
The median value of a set of voltage values is found by a technique that minimizes 
the circuitry while maximizing the speed, and also provides for dropouts. The 

voltage values, illustratively five in number (e.g., V₁ ... V₅), are applied in pairs to 
the inputs of ten comparators (e.g., 100 ... 109). The outputs of the comparators, and 

their complements, are formed into five "status words" (e.g., W₁ ... W₅) of four bits 
each (e.g., C₁₂, C₁₃, C₁₄, C₁₅, ... C₅₁, C₅₂, C₅₃, C₅₄), such that each bit of a given 

status word represents the comparison of a given value with another of the values. 
status word represents the comparison of a given value with another of the values. 

The status word that contains two l's and two 0's represents the median value. In a 
preferred circuit embodiment, this status word is rapidly determined in a series of 

three logic stages, wherein the highest and lowest values are eliminated in the first 
stage (e.g., Fig. 2), the next highest and lowest are eliminated in the second stage 

(e.g., Fig. 3), and the last stage (e.g., 400 ... 404) determines the remaining status 
word that is associated with the median value. This technique also readily provides 

for dropouts by initializing the logic circuitry. For example, the fifth status word 
(associated with the fifth value) is preset to 1111, so that if any single value is not 

received, the missing value is not chosen as the median. Additional dropouts may be 

similarly treated to ensure that the median is chosen only from the voltage values 
actually received. This technique may be used, for example, in a disk drive system, 

where the position of a servo head must be precisely controlled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a technique for determining a desired 
intermediate value from a series of signal values, and integrated circuitry that may be 
used in implementing the technique. In certain applications, it is desirable to determine the median value of a 
set of signal (e.g., voltage) values. For example, a disk drive servo control system 
monitors the position of a pickup head located on a servo arm by measuring the 
strength of the signal induced in the head by the servo tracks underneath the pickup 
head. These servo tracks on the disk contain data signals having a defined pattern. 
As a result of reading the servo control data, a positioning signal is generated to 
move the servo arm as necessary in order to position the pickup head in the desired 
location. In the case of a magnetic disk, the pickup head may be a magnetic head, 
and the signal is induced from the magnetic pattern in the servo tracks. In the case 
of an optical disk, the pickup head may be an optical transducer of various types, and 
the tracks may be optical tracks. It is also known to include both two types of 
signals in a given system, as when an optical pickup is used to position a magnetic 
readout head. In one proposed system, the servo control data is obtained from a 
magnetic head in four bursts of sinusoid signals, with each burst including five sine 
waves of equal magnitude. It is then necessary to determine the amplitude of the 
burst. However, the sinusoids within a burst may be corrupted by noise. In order to 
filter out the noise, one method would be to average the peak values of the five sine 
waves within a burst. A better method is to determine the median value of the peaks 
of the sine waves, which is more likely to yield an accurate estimate of the correct 
value of the sine wave peak when dealing with only a few sine waves. This 
determination of the median is made for each of the four bursts, in order to yield the 
desired positioning information. Various other applications also require determining 
the median value of a set of values, which may be derived from electrical signals or 
other sources.  I have invented a technique for determining the median value of a set of 
values. The values are illustratively sequential voltage values, with other types 
being possible. The voltage values are applied in pairs to the inputs of comparators. 
The outputs of the comparators, and their complements, are formed into "status 
words", such that each bit of a given status word represents the comparison
