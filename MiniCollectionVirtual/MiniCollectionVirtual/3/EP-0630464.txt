<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a device (1) for drying products on a moving conveyor belt (14), in particular the gum strips on envelopes (2), using warm air which is drawn through a heat exchanger (10, 11) and to distributor box (5) by an air current generator (7). The distributor box moveably extends above and along the length of the conveyor belt (14), and is provided with air slits (16) on its underside to ensure that the heated air is distributed evenly. To design a device of this type in such a way that it can be fully and safely exploited by non-specialists, or even, if required, automatically controlled, without a complex control system, it is proposed that the distributor box (5), which can be folded upwards from its fixed position above the conveyor belt (14), should be provided along its longitudinal sides (20) with skirts (27) directed towards the conveyor belt (14), while the energy and warm air input in the chamber thus formed is adjusted by controlling the speed of the air stream generator (7) in function of the temperature of the heat source in the heat exchanger (10, 11), and a deflection plate (43), which deflects the warm air stream upwards, is mounted at one of the front ends of the distributor box (5).
