A method for directly measuring the concentration of 
one or more water treatment compositions in a steam 

generating system which comprises directly determining an 
absorbance or emission spectrum of the system water in 

the wavelenth range of from 200 to 2500 nm, and applying 
chemometrics algorithms to the absorbance or emission

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for 
monitoring the concentration of one or more components of 
water treatment compositions in steam generating systems 
and more particularly to a direct spectrometric method 
for quantifying the concentrations of oxygen scavengers, 
corrosion inhibitors, chelants, nitrates, polymers, 
neutralizing amines, phosphonates, scale inhibitors, 
tracers and/or other boiler water treatment compositions 
which have absorbance or emission spectra in the 
wavelength range of from 200 to 2500 nm by determining 
the spectra of the compositions in the foregoing range 
and then applying chemometric algorithms to the spectrum. The operation and control of steam generating 
systems requires careful monitoring of the water 
treatment composition levels to assure proper continuous 
system protection. As used herein, the terminology 
"steam generating system" refers to any aqueous system 
where water is heated and circulated as steam or hot 
water in a continuous or semi-continuous stream and 
generally includes, but is not limited to boiler systems, 
desalinization units, evaporators, turbines, cookers such 
as those used in food processing, and the like. Traditional analyses of steam generating systems to 
determine the concentrations of the treatment 
compositions contained therein has generally involved 
taking grab samples and performing independent analytical 
procedures for each component of interest. These 
procedures are often time consuming and involve 
significant delay between the time the sample is taken, 
the time the results of the analysis are obtained and  
 
finally the time the subsequent product dosage is 
adjusted. These analyses are further complicated by the need 
to sample the steam generating system water in at least 
three different locations within the system, depending, 
of course, on the particular type of treating agent. 
These locations include the feed water, the continuous 
surface boiler water blowdown and the steam condensate. For example, the concentration of oxygen scavenger 
in a steam-generating system, is typically measured in 
the feedwater, the boiler water blowdown and the steam 
condensate. The concentrations of polymeric dispersants 
are often measured in the feed water and boiler water 
blowdown. Typically the product feed rate for these 
compositions is adjusted based upon the respective 
analyses of the residual oxygen scavenger and dispersant 
present in the boiler water blowdown. While oxygen scavengers have been measured
