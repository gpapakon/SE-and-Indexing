<ABSTRACT>
Current monitoring cells (12) are located at selected 
locations on power supply lines (16) within a chip. Each 

cell (12) compares the current flow at predetermined times 
with a reference. If the current exceeds the reference, a 

signal is provided indicating a fault in the chip. A flip 
flop (30) in the cell is set to maintain an indication of 

the fault condition. In two embodiments, the cells are 
connected with a scan chain which is used to sequentially 

access the test results for each cell. A third embodiment 
does not include the scan chain but the cells (12) are 

individually selectable. A current divider (56) may be 
included in each cell to isolate the voltage drop of the 

fault sensor from the functional circuit to minimize the 
impact of measuring the current for fault detection 

purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for testing integrated circuits.The development of manufacturing test programs for CMOS (complementary
metal-oxide-semiconductor) integrated circuits is a time-consuming and costly
development activity. As the design complexity of CMOS integrated circuits increases,
manufacturing test development is becoming a major portion of the design cycle. At
present, the majority of techniques for test program development are based upon the use
of "stuck-at-fault" arrangements. The "stuck-at-fault" model is the basis for fault
simulation, ATPG (automatic test pattern generation), scan testing, BIST (built-in self test
technique) and some embedded test structures. The "stuck-at-fault" model has been shown
to be inadequate in identifying the majority of possible manufacturing defects.As an alternative approach, US Patent No. 5,097,206 discloses Iddq (static or
quiescent power supply current) testing for detecting manufacturing faults for static CMOS
circuits. The Iddq test is based upon monitoring the quiescent Iddq current. Variations in
the quiescent Iddq current can indicate a faulty circuit. The apparatus known from said US
Patent has the disadvantage of utilizing two modes of operation, normal mode and test
mode.The Journal of Electronic Testing, vol.3, no.4, December 1992, pages 111-120,
discloses an apparatus for testing for faults in an integrated circuit and which includes a
plurality of current monitoring cells embedded within the integrated circuit for detecting
faults therein. Also, US-A-5,115,191 discloses a scanning system which allows for the
reading of a plurality of values representative of tests of signals in an integrated circuit.It is an object of the present invention to provide apparatus for testing an integrated
circuit wherein continuous testing can be performed in an adaptable and efficient manner
during normal operation.Therefore, according to the present invention
as it is defined in the appended claims,
there is provided apparatus for
testing for faults in an integrated circuit, including a plurality of current monitoring cells
embedded within said integrated circuit and capable of detecting faults therein,
wherein a scanning circuit is coupled to said current monitoring cells for
scanning said current monitoring cells, said integrated circuit including power supply buses
and internal power buses and said current monitoring cells providing interconnections
between said power supply buses and said internal power buses, and characterized in that
