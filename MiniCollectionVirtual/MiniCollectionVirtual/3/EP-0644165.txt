<ABSTRACT>
A combined alumina cement / gypsum product comprises 100 parts 
by weight of alumina cement, 10 to 100 parts by weight of an 

aqueous polymer precursor emulsion (Component A), and 15 to 600 
parts by weight of a hemi-hydrate gypsum (Component B). 

Component A preferably comprises a thermosetting acrylic resin, 
and Component B is preferably an alpha-hemihydrate gypsum or an 

anhydrous or retarded plaster. Aggregates, reinforcing materials 
or other additives may be incorporated into the product. 
The product is preferably prepared by mixing together Component 
A and the alumina cement to form a precursor slurry, then mixing 

together the precursor slurry and Component B, and allowing the 
mixture to cure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention related to cement products, in particular cement
products comprising a mixture of alumina cement and gypsum, and
to a method of manufacture thereof.It has previously been proposed to provide gypsum products the
properties of which have been modified by the incorporation of
one or more polymers. For example GB-A-1390360 discloses gypsum
products which have been modified by the addition of various
polymers. A disadvantage of such products containing polymer
additives is that they are prone to weathering or ageing
degradation. This degradation manifests itself as softening,
water penetration, staining, yellowing, cracking, chalking
blistering or flaking.It has also previously been proposed to provide high alumina-based
cementatious products which have been modified by
incorporation of one or more polymers. For example, in European
Patent No 0 021 682 there is disclosed a high alumina cement
product modified by the addition of a polyvinyl alcohol/acetate,
and a manufacturing method which prevents the formation of
Ettringite and greatly enhances tensile and compressive strength
by making Macro-Defect-Free (MDF) cements. This process involves
heating the MDF cement paste to above 72°C to prevent Ettringite
formation whilst curing under an applied pressure of at least
5MPa. The polyvinyl alcohol/acetate in this instance is used as
a plasticiser and flowing agent.The use of gypsum products to accelerate the curing time of
alumina cements has long been known, though the maximum quantity
of gypsum added has been limited to 25% by weight since otherwise
excessive expansion occurs. Similarly, the use of alumina
cements to enhance the strength of gypsum products has long been
practised, but the maximum quantity of alumina cement added has 
been limited to 15% by weight, since addition of greater
quantities again causes excessive expansion.Using either alumina cements to strengthen gypsum products or
gypsum products to accelerate the cure times of alumina cements
impairs the fire resistance of both products. This is because
of the formation of Ettringite. Ettringites are large monostable
crystals that form within the layer lattice structure of both
products. Ettringites dehydrate above 72°C, weakening the
structural integrity of the product when exposed to any heat in
excess of that temperature. It is also the formation of larger
Ettringite crystals that causes the excessive expansion on mixing
of alumina cement and gypsum.It has been reported that low pH cement should be used in Glass
Reinforced
