<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an N-alkyl-carbamylalkanol 
sulfate and a salt thereof, which has 
excellent foaming power and detergency while being low 
in irritancy to the skin, so as to be widely useful as 
detergents for hair, skin, tableware, etc. The 
present invention also relates to a process for 
producing an N-alkyl-carbamylalkanol sulfate and a 
salt thereof and a detergent composition containing 
the same. In recent years, it is demanded that the 
surfactant used as a detergent have excellent surface 
activation capability and other properties, such as 
biodegradability and safety to the skin and eyes. Surfactants satisfying the above demand include 
an acylated amino acid surfactant, an imidazoline 
surfactant and a saccharide surfactant such as an 
alkyl glycoside, which are widely used. However, 
these surfactants are generally poor in detergency and  
 
foaming power, which are especially important in a 
detergent. Therefore, their sole use as an ingredient 
in a shampoo or the like is uncommon, and they are 
generally used in combination with conventional 
anionic surfactants, such as an alkyl sulfate and an 
alkyl ether sulfate. On the other hand, a sulfate of a 
monoethanolamide of a fatty acid and an isethionic 
ester are surfactants that are excellent in both 
safety and foaming power. However, these surfactants 
are unstable in solution. Therefore, the development of a detergent having 
not only excellent foaming power and detergency, but 
also high safety and stability is strongly demanded in 
the art. GB-A-499 022 refers to carboxylic amides being useful as 
assistants in the textile industry. US-A-2 255 082 discloses carboxylic amides as treating 
materials for textiles, leather and paper. In US-A-2 120 512 specific sulphonated oxy fatty acid-amides 
are described as being useful as soap substitutes. In view of the above situation, the present 
inventors have made extensive studies to develop a 
surfactant having not only excellent foaming power and 
detergency, but also high safety so as to be useful as 
a detergent for hair, body, tableware, etc. As a 
result, they have found that an N-alkylcarbamylalkanol 
sulfate having an amide group derived from a primary  
 
or secondary amine of a long chain and a sulfate group 
(-OSO3-), and a salt thereof are surfactants satisfying 
the above demand. Based on this finding, the present 
invention has been completed. Thus, the present invention provides a 
N-alkylcarbamylalkanol sulfate or a salt thereof 
represented by the general
