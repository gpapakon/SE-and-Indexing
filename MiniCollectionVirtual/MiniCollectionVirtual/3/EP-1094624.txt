<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an optical amplifying
apparatus to be employed in an optical repeater station of an
optical communication system and, more particularly, to an
optical amplifying apparatus and a wide-band optical
amplifying apparatus for realizing a wider input dynamic range
and a lower noise. The invention further relates to an optical
communication system including those apparatus.At present, an optical transmission system with a
super-long distance and a high capacity has been demanded for
constructing the future multimedia network. As a system for
realizing that high capacity, a wavelength-division
multiplexing (as will be abbreviated into the "WDM") system
has been investigated and developed because of an advantage
that it can utilize the wide band and the high capacity of
optical fibers.Especially the long-distant optical communication
system is required to have an optical amplifying apparatus for
amplifying the WDM optical signals, because these WDM optical
signals are attenuated while being transmitted in the
super-long distant optical fiber. This optical amplifying
apparatus is demanded to achieve a wide input dynamic range
and a low noise for the super-long distance transmissions
because the distances and transmission losses are different
between optical repeater stations. In the optical communication system for transmitting the
WDM optical signals, the transmission distance is restricted
by the gain gradient based on the gain-wavelength
characteristics of the optical amplifying apparatus, if this
optical amplifying apparatus is inserted into the optical
transmission line. The light is amplified by a semiconductor
laser or a rare earth element doped optical fiber amplifier,
the gain characteristics of which have a wavelength
dependency.If the optical amplifying apparatus are connected in
tandem for elongating the transmission distance, therefore,
the gain gradients to be made in the individual optical
amplifying apparatus are accumulated so that the optical
signal-to-noise ratio (as will be abbreviated into the
"optical-SNR") is lowered in the channel of a lower optical
level of the WDM optical signal whereas the waveforms are
degraded by the nonlinear optical effects or the like in the
channel of a higher optical level of the WDM optical signals.On the other hand, the system gain of the optical
communication system is different at the individual optical
repeater stations because these optical repeater stations have
different distances. The system gain is the difference in the
