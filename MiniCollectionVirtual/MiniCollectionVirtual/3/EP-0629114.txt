Method for the production of a housing with 
electromagnetic screening (1,4), in particular to 

accommodate electronic functional elements (2), with a 
screening profile (8) which is arranged in a 

predetermined section (3a) of at least one housing part 
(1) and which has elastic and conductive material, 

wherein the conductive material (8') is applied in a 
pasty initial state from a needle (6) or nozzle by means 

of pressure, directly onto that section (3a) of the 
housing part (1) on which the screening profile (8) is 

to be arranged and sets there to an elastic condition, 
at the same time adhering to its surface, in such a way 

that the shape of the profile is determined by a 
suitable choice of cross-sectional form and size and the 

scanning rate of the needle or nozzle and by the 
adjustment of material properties such as viscosity, 

thixotropism and rate of curing or cross-linking. 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the needle (6) or nozzle is guided over that section 

(3a) of the housing part (1) on which the screening 
profile (8) is to be arranged, being machine-driven, in 

particular under computer control. 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in 
that the needle (6) or nozzle is guided in such a way 

several times or a plurality of needles or nozzles is 
guided in such a way at least over predetermined regions 

of the section on which the screening profile is to be 
arranged that a screening and sealing profile with a 

cross-section determined essentially by the number, 
outlet cross-section, scanning rate and positional 

relationship of the needle(s) or nozzle(s) is built up 
from a plurality of strands of elastic and conductive  

 
material. 
Method according to claim 3, characterised in that 
different elastic materials are applied in the case 

where the needle or nozzle is guided several times over 
the predetermined regions or in the case where a 

plurality of needles or nozzles is guided over the 
predetermined regions, at least one strand of highly 

conductive material being applied in such a way that a 
continuous conductive connection between the parts of 

the housing (1,4) is established by means of this strand 
in the closed state of the said housing. 
Method according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in 
that the plurality of strands of elastic and conductive 

material is applied in a spatial configuration and in 
each case at a time interval with respect to one another 

in such a way that partial curing or crosslinking of an 
applied strand has taken place when a further strand 

which touches it is applied. 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the elastic and conductive 

material (8') is applied directly onto the edge region 
(3a) of a closable opening (3) of the housing (1,4) 

under computer control and in such a way that the 
screening profile (8) assumes a configuration which 

allows easy opening and closure of the opening (3). 
Method according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the elastic and conductive 

material is applied at room temperature. 
Housing (1,4), prepared by a process according to 
one of the preceding claims, in particular for 

electronic functional elements (2), which screens its 
interior from electromagnetic radiation, with a  

 
screening profile (8) which is arranged in a 

predetermined section (3a) of a housing part (1) and has 
elastic and conductive material, characterised in that 

the screening profile (8) is applied in a pasty, 
adhering form directly on the section (3a) of the 

housing part (1) to form a profile and is set 
resiliently thereon and the shape of the profile is 

determined by a suitable choice of cross-sectional form 
and size and the scanning rate of the needle or nozzle 

and by the adjustment of material properties such as 
viscosity, thixotropism and rate of curing or cross-linking. 
Housing (1,4) according to claim 8, characterised 
in that the screening profile (8;180) is formed from a 

material which crosslinks or sets at room temperature.

over certain areas, from a plurality of strands of 
material arranged next to one another and/or one above
