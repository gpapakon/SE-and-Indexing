<ABSTRACT>
Fitted to one side of a flow channel are two ultrasonic transducers, which operate alternately in the transmitting/receiving mode. On the side, lying opposite the ultrasonic transducers, of the flow channel, there are fastened two reflectors whose geometry is designed such that the ultrasonic signal component with the highest sensitivity, which originates from the centre of the transmitting ultrasonic transducer, is blanked out. The result which is achieved is that the sensitivity distribution of the ultrasonic transducers is averaged out and the flow measurement becomes independent of the prevailing flow profile.

Flowmeter device 

in which a flow channel (SK) having a first ultrasound 
transducer (USW1) and a second ultrasound transducer 

(USW2) and having a first reflector (RE1) arranged in the 
flow channel (SK) and a second reflector (RE2) is provided, 

and 
in which a first reflector element (R1) which expands 
the ultrasound wavefront is arranged in the main beam 

path of the ultrasound in the flow channel (SK), so that 
US waves transmitted from the centre of an ultrasound 

transducer are deviated with the aid of the reflectors in 
the direction of the side walls of the flow channel and 

are thereby excluded from the main beam path. 
Device according to Claim 1, 

in which the cross-section of the first reflector 
element (R1) is triangular. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, 

in which the first reflector element (R1) is arranged 
centrally on the first reflector (RE1). 
Device according to Claim 1, 2 or 3, 

in which a second reflector element (R2) which expands 
the ultrasound wavefront is arranged in the flow channel 

(SK). 
Device according to Claim 4, 

in which the cross-section of the second reflector 
element (R2) is triangular. 
Device according to Claim 4 or 5, 

in which the second reflector element (R2) is arranged 
centrally on the second reflector (RE2). 
Device according to one of the preceding claims, 

in which the first reflector (RE1) is arranged facing 
the first ultrasound transducer (USW1) and the second 

reflector (RE2) is arranged facing the second ultrasound 
transducer (USW2).
