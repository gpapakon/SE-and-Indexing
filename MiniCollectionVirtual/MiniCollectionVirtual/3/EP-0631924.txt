<ABSTRACT>
A frame forming member includes a member body formed 
from an extrudate having a closed sectional structure 

portion (6), and a junction for another member (5), which is 
integral with said member body and formed by expanding a 

portion of a peripheral wall of said closed sectional 
structure portion (6).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a frame forming
member for use in a frame structure, for example, for a
vehicle body.Conventionally, in a frame structure for a vehicle
body, a joint member having three junctions is used,
for example, when an upper front pillar as a frame
forming member is joined with a front roof rail as well
as a side roof rail. The junctions and the front
pillar or the like are welded after fitting.However, when the joint member is used, following
disadvantages are encountered: the number of parts is
increased, resulting an increased manufacture cost for
a frame structure. In addition, the number of joining
points is large, resulting in a reduction in rigidity
of the frame structure, a reduction in dimensional
accuracy due to a thermal strain by a welding and an
assembly inaccuracy.In an article entitled "Anwendungsaspekte beim
Innenhochdruck-Umformen" by F. Klaas in
Werkstattstechnik 79, Springer-Verlag 1989, (pages 210-214)
there is disclosed a method of manufacturing a
component from a tubular workpiece by subjecting the
workpieces to a high internal pressure so as to expand
the wall of the workpiece to a desired configuration.According to the present invention there is
provided a frame forming member, comprising a member 
body having a closed sectional structure portion and a
junction for another member, which is integral with
said member body and formed by expanding a portion of a
peripheral wall of said closed sectional structure
portion, characterised in that the member body is
formed from an extrudate having a non-circular cross-section
and having longitudinally extending flanges and
in that the peripheral wall portion which is expanded
includes one of the longitudinally extending flanges.With the above construction, since the member body
of the frame forming member is formed from an extrudate
having a closed sectional structure portion, the frame
forming member has a high rigidity. In addition, since
the junction is integral with the member body, a
reduction in the number of parts and joining points is
achieved. Thus, it is possible to provide a reduction
in manufacture cost for the frame structure and
increases in rigidity and dimensional accuracy.For a better understanding of the present
invention and to show how the same may be carried into
effect, reference will now be made, by way of example,
to the accompanying drawings, in which:-
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic perspective illustration
of a frame structure of a vehicle body;Fig. 2 is a perspective view of an essential
portio
