<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a rubber article, in particular a tyre, an air cushion or a drive belt, containing at least one basic, aminic, aromatic antiageing agent and having a non-black surface on the rubber article, for example in the form of letters and/or numbers and/or trademarks and/or pictures and/or - for example in tyres - a complete side wall. In order to counter, in an environmentally friendly manner, a colour change of the non-black surface as a consequence of migration of basic, aminic, aromatic antiageing agents from a rubber article into the non-black surface located thereon, it is proposed that the non-black surface contains inorganic acidic constituents.

<CLAIMS>
Rubber article, more especially a tyre, air spring 
or drive belt, having at least one basic, aminic, aromatic 

anti-oxidant and having a non-black area (1), which is 
situated on the rubber article, e.g. in the form of letters 

and/or numbers and/or trade marks and/or pictures and/or - 
e.g. with tyres - a complete side wall, characterised in 

that the non-black area (1) contains inorganic, acid 
ingredients in the form of acid adsorbents and/or 

substantially non-volatile inorganic - acids and/or their 
salts. 
Rubber article according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the acid, inorganic ingredients of its non-black 

area (1) are acid adsorbents, precipitated silica, acid 
carbon blacks and/or aluminium hydroxide. 
Rubber article according to claim 1, characterised 
in that the substantially non-volatile inorganic acids are, 

for example, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid and/or their 
salts. 
Rubber article according to at least one of claims 
1 to 3, characterised in that the acid ingredients of its 

non-black area (1) are contained in deposits of porous 
substances. 
Rubber article according to claim 4, characterised 
in that the porous substances are zeolites, carbon black, 

active carbon and/or sawdust. 
Rubber article according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a polymer layer (3) 

of its non-black area (1) facing the rubber article 
comprises non-polar polymers which at least make it  

 
difficult for polar substances to pass through the polymer 

layer (3). 
Rubber article according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that dynamically 

loadable, coloured imprints (6) are disposed on the edges 
of the visible top side (5) of its non-black area (1). 
Rubber article according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that a permanently 

adherent, vulcanisable adhesive layer (4), known per se, is 
situated on the underside of its non-black area (1) and 

contains polyterpenes. 
Rubber article according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that its non-black area 

(1) has at least one prevulcanised layer (e.g. layer 2). 
Rubber article according to at least one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that inorganic acid 

ingredients are introduced in a plurality of layers of its 
non-black area (1). 
Non-black area (1), which is formed from layers 
of rubber and/or plastics material and is to be applied to 

rubber articles, characterised in that it contains 
inorganic, acid ingredients. 
Non-black area (1) according to claim 11, 
characterised by at least one of the characterising 

features of at least one of claims 2 to 10. 
Non-black area (1) according to claim 11 or 12, 
characterised in that a supporting film (8) is disposed on 

the adhesive layer (4) situated on the underside of the 
non-black area (1).
