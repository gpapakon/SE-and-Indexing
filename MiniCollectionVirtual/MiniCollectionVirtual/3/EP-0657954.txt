<ABSTRACT>
A multi-cavity dielectric filter 30 having a single housing 32 for a plurality of 
resonant cavities 65. The dielectric filter 30 has a plurality of dielectric resonators 42 

placed inside housing 32, instead of in individual housings, wherein the resonators 42 are 
spaced a quarter wave apart and are electrically isolated from one another by conductive 

isolation plates 44 positioned therebetween. The isolation plates 44 do not make 
continuous mechanical contact with the interior conducting surface of housing 32, but 

rather are spaced from the inner surface 77 of housing 32, thereby making assembly of 
the filter much simpler than if a solid RF connection had to be made. The resonators 42 

are positioned inside the housing 32 between the isolation plates 44 and are supported by 
low loss, low dielectric constant spacers 46. End walls 59 complete the cavity formation 

at the termination ends 79 of housing 32. For a band reject filter, the cavities are joined 
by coupling loops connected to a transmission line while for a bandpass filter, apertures 

are placed in the isolation plates (44') so as to couple electromagnetic energy between 
adjacent cavities (65).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is concerned with a multi-cavity dielectric filter for operation within a
predetermined filtering band comprising:
A) a housing having an electrically conductive inner surface and two termination end
regions;B) coupling means, having input and output connectors for coupling electromagnetic
energy into and out from said filter; andC) a plurality of dielectric resonator cavities comprising:
(1) a plurality of dielectric resonators being positioned within said housing;(2) an electrically conductive isolation plate disposed between each adjacent pair of
dielectric resonators, each isolation plate having an outer periphery less than the
corresponding inner surface of the housing
for providing an amount of coupling of electromagnetic energy between cavities, said
amount ranging from near zero to a predetermined amount;(3) means for securing each isolation plate within the housing so that for each
isolation plate, its corresponding outer periphery is, at least throughout most of its
peripheral path, spaced away from the inner surface of the housing; and(4) end walls connected to the termination end regions of the housing
(US-A-4 942 377).Dielectric filters typically are used for filtering electromagnetic energy in the ultra-high
frequency band, such as those used for cellular communications in the 800+ MHz
frequency range. Band reject filters often comprise a plurality of dielectric notch
resonators that are coupled to a transmission line by means of well-known coupling
techniques. Bandpass filters also often comprise a plurality of dielectric resonators. Representative of such filters are the filters shown in US-A-4 862 122 and
US-A-5 065 119. These filters are designed and manufactured having a plurality of
dielectric resonators with each dielectric resonator having its own housing and each
housing having top and bottom covers and cylindrical or rectangular sidewalls. Each
housing serves to contain electromagnetic fields thereby preventing radiation losses that
would lower the quality factor (Q) of the resonator. The Q is also related to the internal
dimensions and the conductivity of each housing. The resonators in the case of notch
filters are positioned along a transmission line at intervals of an odd multiple of a quarter
wavelength as determined by the center of the filtering frequency. The transmission line
serves to couple the resonators thereby producing the desired frequency response. In the
bandpass case the resonators are usually proximity coupled, within input and output
connectors
