<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a device for cooking food without frying fat where touchable parts are kept well cooled and the food products can be taken out without the device having to be dismantled or tools beeing used and where the amount of watervapour in the food processing compartment can be regulated in such a way that optimum process quality can be reached. The invention solves these problems by the food processing taking place in the rotating food processing compartment (8) which is flushed by hot air driven by a fan (12) placed inside the oven compartment on five sides surrounded by the shell (2) and the sixth side of which is covered by a componenet consisting of the heat shield (4) and the cooling-air duct (5) broken through by the rotatable basket holder (6) with the basket (7) and with their corresponding heat shields (20, 21) and cooling-air ducts (22, 23). Cooling air is pressed by the fan system (13) into the housing (2) and further in through the openings (15) into the cooling-air duct (18) of the front panel. The food product is reached by withdrawal of the basket (7) by means of the handle (46) without any opening procedure. The regulation of the amount of water vapour necessary for the quality of the food product is done by moving the ventilation slide (58) which in the same movement opens or closes the openings in the ventilation device (47) to the inlet opening (52), to the injector (56) where a part of the air enters and passes through to the ejector (57) where the air which enters via the injector (56) together with excess water vapour exits from the oven compartment (1) and is mixed with remaining cold air from the cooling-air fan (3) and continues into the surrounding air.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention describes a hot-air oven for
preparing food without frying fat, said oven comprising a
housing and an oven compartment within said housing with a
container which is insertable into the oven compartment
through a front panel thereof for receiving and preparing
food products by means of hot-air heated in the oven
compartment by heating devices.The technique of preparing food in a rotating cooking area being
flownthrough by hot air is already known. The prior art ovens
using this method have, when put into practical use, often
been found to suffer from certain troublesome drawbacks,
mainly uncomfortable high temperatures on parts that are
touched when using the equipment and in many cases causing
burns to the user, forcing him to use protective gloves,
saucepan holders or other means of heat protection to be
able to take out the cooked product.It is therefore an object of the invention to devise a
hot-air oven for preparing of food in hot-air which
minimizes the risk of being burned to the user when taking
the cooked product out from the oven.US-A-4,071,738 discloses a domestic cooking range of the
ventilated type having surface elements and an underlying
oven characterized by an extension of the ventilating fan
motor shaft carrying an auxiliary fan disposed within the
oven which provides forced circulation of air in the oven.
The oven may thus be selectively operated in the
conventional radiant heating mode or in the forced
circulation or "convected" mode depending upon whether the
ventilating fan motor is in operation. The oven can be held
at an elevated temperature for a time interval to accelerate
catalytic self-cleaning because of air circulation within
the oven door and passages adjacent the door, this cooling 
air flow being induced by operation of the ventilating fan.CH-A-631 802 discloses an oven for baking, roasting and
grilling wherein a fan sucks in air from the exterior to the
oven on one hand through the oven compartment and on the
other hand through a channel provided in the access door for
the oven compartment.The object is resolved by an hot-air oven for preparing food
as mentioned above wherein a space is designed between the
housing and the oven compartment that allows cooling air
forced into the space by a cooling air fan to be
distributed on the one hand to an air-duct formed in the
front panel between shields facing the side of the oven
compartment which is not surrounded by the housing and
cooling air-ducts connected to the housing for guiding
cooling air

<CLAIMS>
A hot-air oven for preparing food without frying
fat, said oven comprising a housing (2) and an oven

compartment (1) within said housing with a container
(6, 7) which is insertable into the oven compartment

(1) through a front panel (3) thereof for receiving and
preparing food products by means of hot air heated in

the oven compartment by heating devices, characterized
in that between the housing (2) and the oven

compartment (1) a space (80) is designed that allows
cooling air forced into the space (80) by a cooling air

fan (13) to be distributed on the one hand to an
air-duct (18) formed in the front panel (3) between

heat shields (4, 20, 21) facing the side of the oven
compartment (1) which is not surrounded by the housing

(2) and cooling air ducts (5, 22, 23) connected to the
housing (2) for guiding cooling air (79) through the

air-duct (18) and on the other hand through a
ventilation device (47) mounted in the oven compartment

(1) for regulating the amount of water vapour in the
oven compartment (1) under working conditions. 
A hot-air oven as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the cooling air fan (13) is arranged to
suck in cooling air via a cooling air filter (14) for flushing of all the sides of the oven

compartment, for keeping the outer surfaces of the oven at a touch-safe temperature and to
