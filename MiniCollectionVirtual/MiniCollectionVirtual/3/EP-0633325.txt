<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward a nickel-base alloy with
superior stress rupture strength and grain size control, as well as fatigue strength
and corrosion resistance.There exists in certain industries a need for alloys which can operate
under severe conditions, notably high temperature and stress. This is true, for
example, with respect to gas turbine components, where current specifications
require a life of greater than 50 hours at stress rupture conditions of 871°C/98 MPa
(1600°F/14.2ksi). The manufacturers of such components have been setting
increasingly higher standards, thus requiring materials suppliers to search for better
alloys while maintaining a competitive price. The strict requirements for such an
alloy require that it have isothermal and cyclic oxidation resistance, carburization
resistance, good thermal stability after long term exposure at intermediate 
temperatures, good weldability, controlled grain size, and excellent stress rupture
strength.One alloy widely used for this purpose has been Inconel® alloy 617, the
composition thereof departing from that according to the present invention in missing content of tantalum
(Inconel is a trademark of the Inco family of companies). Stress rupture (SRU) life
for this alloy has typically been limited to approximately 47 hours at 927°C/62 MPa
(1700°F/9ksi). Indeed, SRU life can be extended to over 100 hours with increased
annealing temperatures. However, this greater SRU life is obtained at the expense
of cyclic fatigue strength, which is lowered by the increased grain size resulting from
the higher anneal temperature.A nickel-based alloy composition similar to Inconel® alloy 617 is disclosed in GB-A-1 336 409.is It is an object of the present invention to provide a nickel-base alloy
which exhibits improved stress rupture life, excellent fatigue strength through grain
size control and has good corrosion resistance.Accordingly, there is provided an alloy having the composition, in
weight percent, of about:
