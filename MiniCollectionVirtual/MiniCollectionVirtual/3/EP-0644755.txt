<ABSTRACT>
Dispersible particles consisting essentially of a crystalline NSAID having a surface modifier adsorbed on the surface thereof in an amount sufficient to maintain an effective average particle size of less than about 400 nm. Pharmaceutical compositions containing the particles exhibit reduced gastric irritation following oral administration and/or hastened onset of action.

<DESCRIPTION>
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are 
one of the most commonly used and therapeutically effective 
groups of drugs. However, gastric irritation problems 
constitute the most frequently recognized adverse side effect 
following oral administration of NSAIDs. Such side effects 
are well recognized and must be weighed against the clinical 
efficacy of the drugs. A great amount of research has been undertaken in 
an attempt to understand the underlying mechanism responsible 
for these effects. For example, Cioli et al, Tox. and Appl. 
Pharm., 50, 283-289 (1979) suggest that gastrointestinal 
lesions in laboratory animals resulting from the oral 
administration of acidic NSAIDs may depend on two different 
mechanisms: a local action exerted by contact with the 
gastric mucosa and a generalized/centrally mediated 
(systemic) action, taking place following oral 
administration. More recently, Price et al, Drugs 40 (Suppl. 5):1-11, 
1990, suggest that NSAID-induced gastric damage occurs as 
a result of NSAID-mediated direct and indirect acidic damage 
followed almost simultaneously by the deleterious systemic 
effect of prostaglandin inhibition. A variety of strategies have been used in the 
management of NSAID-induced gastric damage. These include: 
1) the development and use of NSAIDs with less toxic 
potential; 2) the reduction or elimination of the agent that 
actually causes the injury; and 3) the enhancement of the 
mucosal defense. However, these approaches have not proven 
entirely successful. For example, the most effective means of preventing 
gastric damage, i.e., by eliminating the primary aetiological  
 
agent is rarely feasible with NSAIDs inasmuch as patients 
with severe inflammatory disease are rarely able to cease 
using these drugs. Although selection of less toxic 
NSAIDs should prove useful, the only practical solution, 
at present, is to treat the NSAID induced gastric damage. 
Misoprostol (a methylated prostaglandin E1) has been 
approved by the FDA for use in preventing NSAID 
gastropathy. However, Misoprostol is expensive, must be 
administered multiple times daily and can cause 
unacceptable side effects. Thus it would be highly desirable to provide NSAID 
formulations that can exhibit a reduction in gastric 
irritation. Moreover, it would be desirable to provide 
NSAID formulations exhibiting hastened onset of action. We have discovered that pharmaceutical compositions 
containing surface modified crystalline NSAID 
nanoparticles exhibit reduced gastric irritation
