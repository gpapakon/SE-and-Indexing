<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with Government support under
Grant Contract No. N00014-86-K-0347 awarded by the Office of
Naval Research, and Grant Contract Nos. HD-20034, NIA-06088,
HD-00669, awarded by NIH and NIA R01 AG08514, awarded by the
Department of Health and Human Services. The Government has
certain rights in this invention.This application is a continuation-in-part of
copending patent application United States Serial Number
285,196, filed December 15, 1988, the entire disclosure of
which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.The present invention relates to the use of recombinant
technology for genetic modification of donor cells for
grafting into the central nervous system (CNS) of a subject to
treat defects, disease or damage of the CNS. More
specifically, the invention relates to the insertion of genes
into donor cells, encoding molecules having ameliorative
effects on cells in the CNS, including neurons into donor
cells such that when the donor cells are grafted into the CNS
the molecules are expressed and exert their effects on
diseased or damaged cells. Attempts to repair the mammalian brain or replace CNS
functions resulting from defects or following disease or
damage to the CNS are hampered by an incomplete understanding
of the complex structure-function relationships in the CNS.
Although knowledge of some basic principles of cell function
in the brain has advanced greatly in recent years,
understanding of interactions between clusters of cells or
systems and cell circuits in different regions of the brain
and their relationship to the outward manifestations of
behavior and neurological function lags far behind.
Difficulties in approaching these problems have been caused,
in part, by the large number of different cell types in the
mammalian CNS and the number and complexity of their
connections. In addition, the blood-brain barrier makes
access to the brain for diagnosis, treatment and the design of
new therapies more difficult.In spite of the absence of sophisticated knowledge of the
pathophysiology of most normal or abnormal brain functions,
some attempts at pharmacological therapy for CNS dysfunction
have already become useful and effective. These include the
use of psycho-active drugs for psychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia, and specific replacement therapy in the rare
cases in which the biochemical and cellular bases of the CNS
disorder are relatively better understood, as in Parkinson's
disease. At the core of most therapeutic approaches is the
objective of replacing
