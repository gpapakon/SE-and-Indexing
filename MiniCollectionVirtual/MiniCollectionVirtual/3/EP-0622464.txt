<ABSTRACT>
A method of detecting the presence of a target 
polynucleotide in a sample is disclosed. The method 

comprises the steps of hybridizing the target 
polynucleotide with a detector probe, the detector probe 

comprising a first oligonucleotide having a detectable 
group such as alkaline phosphatase attached to the 3' 

terminus thereof; hybridizing the target polynucleotide 
with a capture probe, the capture probe comprising a 

second oligonucleotide having a capture group such as biotin attached to 
the 5' terminus thereof; and detecting the hybridization 

of the detector probe and the capture probe to the target 
polynucleotide. Probes, probe sets, and kits useful for 

carrying out the invention are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the detection of 
genetic material with oligonucleotide probes in sandwich 
assays. One known strategy for detecting the presence of 
a target polynucleotide within a sample is called the 
sandwich assay. A sandwich assay employs separate detector 
and capture oligonucleotides, each of which are 
complimentary to a base pair sequence of the target 
polynucleotide of interest. In the presence of the target 
polynucleotide, the detector and capture oligonucleotides 
each hybridize to a complimentary base pair sequence. 
Typically, the detector oligonucleotide will be conjugated 
to a moiety that is capable of producing a detectable 
signal upon contact with a particular signalling substrate. 
The capture oligonucleotide is fixed either directly or 
through a fixing moiety to a solid support. After removing 
excess sample and other reagents from the solid support, 
the capture-target-detector complex is exposed to the 
signalling substrate. The intensity of the signal 
produced by the signalling substrate indicates the  
 
concentration of the target polynucleotide present in the 
sample. When a signalling moiety is employed, it is 
generally attached to either the internal portion of the 
polynucleotide (as is the case when radioactive labels are 
added to the detector probe through chemical "nicking" of 
nucleotides) or to the 5' terminus of the detector. A 
common problem that has affected the sensitivity of 
sandwich assays is the presence of non-specific signal in 
the assay. Non-specific signalling can be due to retention 
of unhybridized detector probe in the solution, etc. Non-specific 
signal can skew the results of an assay by 
increasing the number of false positive results; this 
reduces the sensitivity of the test, thereby precluding the 
assay from accurately detecting small concentrations of 
target nucleotide in the sample. C. Brakel et al., EPO Appln. 0330221, describes 
oligonucleotides with at least one biotin attached at each 
end thereof and an assay system for use therewith. J. Tada et al., Molec. and Cellular Probes6, 
489 (1992), describes an assay employing an amplification 
primer which is labelled with biotin at the 5' end thereof. In view of the foregoing, it is a first object 
of the present invention to provide a sandwich assay with 
reduced non-specific background signal. A second, object of the present invention to 
provide a kit suitable for expeditious performance of 
sandwich assays with reduced non-specific background 
signal. A third object of
