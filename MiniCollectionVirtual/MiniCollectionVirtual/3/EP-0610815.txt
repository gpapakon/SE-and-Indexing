<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a flexible, single- or multilayer, unoriented or monoaxially or biaxially oriented film in which at least one layer contains a cycloolefin copolymer, where the cycloolefin copolymer has a mechanical loss factor (tan  delta ) of 
>
/=0.015 at 50@C below the glass transition temperature.

<CLAIMS>
A single- or multilayer mono- or biaxially

comprises a cycloolefin copolymer, wherein the
cycloolefin copolymer has a mechanical loss factor

(tan δ) of ≥ 0.015 at 50°C below the glass transition
temperature.
A film as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
13
C-NMR
spectrum of the cycloolefin copolymer has a peak

at 42.2 ppm.
A film as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the

13
C-NMR spectrum of the cycloolefin copolymer has
peaks at 28.0, 31.5, 33.1, 41.3, 47.7 and

48.8 ppm.
A film as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 3,
which is a single-layer film.
A film as claimed in one or more of claims 1 to 4,
