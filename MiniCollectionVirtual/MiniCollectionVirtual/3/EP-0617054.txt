<ABSTRACT>
Amine functional polymers which are terpolymers made up of randomly 
linked units of amidine or amidinium formate, N-vinylformamide and either 

vinylamine or vinylammonium formate are prepared by aqueous hydrolysis of 
poly(N-vinylformamide) at a temperature in the range of 90 to 175°C, 

preferably in the presence of a minor amount of ammonia or volatile amine. 
Best conversions and good control of polymer structure are obtained at 140 

to 160°C with a small concentration of ammonia or alkylamine. Formation of 
poly(vinylammonium formate) containing no other salts or ionic coproducts 

is realized by degassing the hydrolyzate to remove ammonia or amine from 
the polymer solution. The poly(vinylammonium formate) affords distinct 

advantages in the production of salt-free polymers by catalytic 
decomposition of impurities. Poly(vinylamines) containing significant 

amounts of amidine functionality offer advantages in applications where 
increased basicity is required.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to poly(vinylammonium formate) and to a 
process for its manufacture. In another aspect it relates to a process for 
making amidine-containing terpolymers by controlled aqueous hydrolysis of 
poly(N-vinylformamide). Interest in amine functional polymers has grown rapidly in recent 
years owing to their demonstrated utility in a broad spectrum of operations 
which capitalize on their solubility in water and their reactivity under 
relatively mild conditions. Such polymers have found uses as flocculants, 
filtration aids, paper strengthening agents, in enhanced oil recovery and 
as crosslinking agents for epoxy resins and polyurethanes. As the 
commercial value of these polymers has become recognized, more and more 
attention has been devoted to developing polymers containing amine 
functionality but tailored to specific needs. Poly(vinylamine) (pVA) is perhaps the most promising of amine 
functional polymers because of its simplicity of manufacture and its 
versatility. Since its theoretical monomeric unit, vinylamine, is 
unstable, pVA is made indirectly by polymerizing a vinylamide, such as N-vinylformamide, 
and hydrolyzing the resulting polymer to develop its amine 
functionality. Complete hydrolysis is difficult if not impossible to 
achieve and it is well recognized that polymers made by this route and 
referred to as homopolymers of vinylamine are actually copolymers 
containing vinylamine units (perhaps as high as 98 mol percent) and N-vinylformamide 
units. A third unit, amidine, has also been recognized as 
an impurity which is to be minimized in order to increase primary amine 
functionality. It has been known for over a decade that hydrochloric acid hydrolysis 
of poly(N-vinylacetamide) does not produce an absolute homopolymer but a 
product containing both amine and amidine units resulting from the acid-catalyzed 
condensation of adjacent amine and acetamido groups. See J. P.  
 
Brown et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 26, 1300 (1983). This 
article, citing unpublished work of Dawson and Brock, states on page 1304 
that the amidine formation can be avoided by use of alkaline hydrolysis 
media. U.S. 4,393,174, Dawson et al. (1983) expands on the Brown et al. 
disclosure in describing the preparation of poly(N-vinylacetamide) and 
poly(N-vinylformamide) with subsequent hydrolysis to poly(vinylamine) which 
is useful in making polymeric dyes. It is pointed out that hydrolysis of 
the amide groups is not easy and has typically been carried out in 
refluxing aqueous
