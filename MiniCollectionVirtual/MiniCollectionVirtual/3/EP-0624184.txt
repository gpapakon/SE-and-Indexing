<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the bonding of various elastomeric
substrates to ferrous and non-ferrous metal
surfaces. More specifically, the present invention relates to an
aqueous primer composition based on a latex of a chlorosulfonated
polyethylene and a polyvinyl alcohol-stabilized phenolic resin dispersion.Governmental regulations regarding the use of volatile
organic compounds (VOC) in industrial coatings and adhesives are
becoming increasingly circumscribing with each passing year.
Manufacturers using adhesive compositions to bond various materials
such as elastomeric materials to metal surfaces are therefore under
an increasing pressure to reduce the amount of VOC utilized in their
manufacturing processes. In order to continue utilizing adhesive and
primer compositions based on organic solvents, these manufacturers
will be required to purchase incineration equipment or reduce their
manufacturing output in order to meet the increasingly demanding
regulations. The purchase of incineration equipment and/or the
reduction in manufacturing output will effectively reduce the
profitability of numerous manufacturers which may result in the loss
of jobs, thereby contributing to the current decline in the economy.A more desirable response to the regulations regarding the
use of VOC is the development of aqueous adhesive and primer
compositions which would replace the current solvent-based adhesive
and primer compositions utilized by manufacturers. With utilization
of aqueous adhesive and primer compositions, the manufacturers can
continue their operations at the same rate and avoid the purchase of
expensive incinerator equipment while simultaneously reducing
worker exposure to the hazardous VOC. Previous efforts to develop aqueous adhesive and primer
compositions are manifested in various U.S. patents. For example,
U.S. Pat. No. 4,167,500 describes an aqueous adhesive composition that
contains a water dispersible novolak phenolic resin, a methylene
donor such as an acetal homopolymer or acetal copolymer, and water.
The phenolic resins described are primarily derived from resorcinol
and alkylphenols such as p-nonylphenol although various other
polyhydroxy phenols are mentioned, such as phloroglucinol and
pyrogallol.U.S. Patent No. 4,988,753 describes an aqueous dispersion for
bonding natural and synthetic elastomers to metallic and non-metallic
substrates under vulcanizing conditions. The adhesive composition
contains a mixture of chlorosulfonated polyethylene and vinyl
chloride/vinylidene
