<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a virus and substances 
related thereto, in particular a virus isolated from 
human neuroblastoma cells, which virus induces small 
foci (micro-foci) in certain cell cultures and will be 
referred to herein as micro-foci inducing virus or MFV. Neuroblastoma is believed to originate from the 
malignant transformation of neural crest progenitor 
cells which develop inter alia into the sympathetic 
nervous system, adrenal medulla and other tissues. 
Neuroblastoma can be classified into two distinct 
groups; the first is generally diagnosed at a younger 
age and has the better prognosis while the other group 
having the worst prognosis is accompanied by the 
appearance of specific markers which include increased 
levels of urinary catecholamines and of serum ferritin 
and genetic markers peculiar to tumour cells. Examples 
of such genetic markers in the more aggressive 
neuroblastoma type (second type) are: i) presence of a 
diploid karyotype (the first type of neuroblastoma 
appears to be aneuploid or triploid) ii) specific 
chromosomal deletions, particularly on chromosome 1p and 
iii) amplification of the proto-oncogene N-myc (in one 
case about 1,000 times). The amplification of N-myc 
appears to be an independent marker of poor prognosis. Earlier studies of neuroblastoma have been 
inconclusive as to the exact nature of its cause. 
Reference has been made for example to a DNA virus (e.g. 
cytomegalovirus) being the causative agent. Others have 
suggested that neuroblastoma which arises in the neonate 
or very young child is a consequence of exposure in 
utero to a carcinogen. It has been observed that the 
majority of cases in a cluster of neuroblastoma cases 
showed birth related problems and there was a higher  
 
number of congenital malformations (particularly spina 
bifida) observed among children born in the same area 
and time period as the cases in the neuroblastoma 
cluster. Surprisingly, it has now been discovered that 
a virus comprising segmented, double-stranded RNA and 
having a particle diameter of about 72nm is present in 
neuroblastoma cells studied and that its presence causes 
N-myc amplification in infected cells. According to one aspect of the invention, there is 
provided a virus of icosahedral structure having a 
diameter of about 72nm, double-stranded RNA in seven 
segments of molecular weights 4.0, 3.9, 2.3, 2.2, 1.6, 
1.4 and 1.3 kb, which is capable of infecting human 
neural crest cells and other human ectodermal cells, 
causes N-myc amplification
