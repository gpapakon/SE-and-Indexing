<ABSTRACT>
A control circuit controls a directional-coupling type optical switch, inputs
excited light from an excitation LD light source mainly via a WDM coupler to an

EDF, and thereby intensifies forward excitation and controls drive current of the
light source so that signal light with a desired value is output. On the other

hand, when signal light power with a desired value is not obtained even when
the drive current of the light source reaches an upper limit, the control circuit

gradually increases the ratio of the excited light to be entered to the EDF via
the WDM coupler, and at the same time controls the drive current of the light

source so that the signal light with the desired value is output.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wavelength-division-multiplexing
optical fiber amplifier, and more particularly, to a wavelength-division-multiplexing
optical fiber amplifier that amplifies a wavelength-division-multiplexing
light signal using a fiber doped with rare-earth elements.As a wavelength division multiplexing optical fiber amplifier, EDFA
(Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier) is conventionally known. This EDFA
changes output signal optical power according to the number of input
signals to keep the input/output level for each wavelength constant.On the other hand, in the field of wavelength-division-multiplexing
optical fiber amplifiers, wavelength-division-multiplexing optical fiber
amplifiers using a wavelength range of 1580 nm (1570 nm to 1600 nm)
instead of the previous 1550 nm range have been developed in recent years.
When a high-level (multi-wavelength) signal of approximately -5 dBm (32
waves), etc. is input, the efficiency of this wavelength-division-multiplexing
optical fiber amplifier using the 1580-nm range for forward excitation only
or for backward excitation only is as low as 10% and achieving output of +20
dBm requires excitation power as high as 1 W. For this reason,
improving the efficiency requires bi-directional excitation.Fig. 4 shows a block diagram of the above-described conventional
example of a wavelength-division-multiplexing optical fiber amplifier using
the 1580-nm range. In the figure, signal light to be amplified is introduced
from an optical connector 10 through an optical isolator 11a to a wavelength-division-multiplexing
(WDM) coupler 12a. On the other hand, excited light
output from an excitation LD (laser diode) light source 13 is bifurcated with
a division ratio of 1:1 by a 1×2 division coupler 14 having a division ratio of 
1:1.The signal light is combined with the excited light from the 1×2
division coupler 14 by the WDM coupler 12a, amplified by an erbium-doped
fiber (EDF) 15, combined with the excited light by a WDM coupler 12b and
output through an optical isolator 11b to an optical connector 16. In this
way, this conventional wavelength-division- multiplexing optical fiber
amplifier provides bidirectional excitation by connecting the 1×2 division
coupler 14 to the WDM couplers 12a and 12b, provided on the input side
and output side, respectively, of the EDF 15 and by simultaneously
executing forward excitation by which the excited light is input from the
input side of the EDF 15 in the same direction as that of the signal light
and backward excitation by
