<ABSTRACT>
A non-azeotropic refrigerant composition which can be 
used in refrigerators originally designed to use a Freon 

refrigerant without the need of changing the specifications 
thereof and which is harmless to men and environment. The 

refrigerant composition consists essentially of nitrogen, 
water, a freezing-point depressant (NaCl), a phosphate, and 

a polyhydric alcohol. In production, a stirring tank (1) is 
evacuated to produce a vacuum therein. Sodium chloride and 

pure water are mixed together to prepare an aqueous sodium 
chloride solution. Further, trisodium phosphate is 

dissolved in the aqueous solution to prepare an aqueous 
sodium chloride and trisodium phosphate solution, which is 

then stored in a tank (20). The aqueous sodium chloride and 
trisodium phosphate solution, ethylene glycol and propylene 

glycol are injected into the stirring tank (1), and the 
mixture is stirred. In addition, liquid nitrogen is 

injected into the stirring tank (1) little by little, and a 
motor (4) is activated to drive a stirring element (2), 

thereby stirring the mixture.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a refrigerant 
composition used in refrigerators or other similar machines 
and also relates to a method of producing the refrigerant 
composition. More particularly, the present invention 
relates to a refrigerant composition containing at least 
nitrogen, water, and a freezing-point depressant for 
depressing the freezing point of water, and also relates to 
a method of producing such a refrigerant composition. A typical refrigerator has a compressor, a condenser, 
an evaporator, a receiver, an oil separator, an accumulator, 
etc., which constitute a refrigerating cycle. The purpose 
of the refrigerator is to absorb heat from a low-temperature 
heat source and to release the heat where the temperature is 
relatively high, which resembles the use of a pump to raise 
water to a higher place. Therefore, the refrigerator is 
also called "heat pump". Meantime, when the purpose of the 
refrigerator is to release heat into a high-temperature heat 
source so as to use it for heating, the system is also 
called "heat pump air conditioning unit". A refrigerant 
used in the refrigerating cycle is evaporated at low 
temperature in the evaporator to form a high-temperature, 
high-pressure gas, which is then cooled in the condenser to 
return to a liquid refrigerant. In this way, the  
 
refrigerant circulates in the refrigerator, thereby 
continuously performing a refrigerating operation. Typical 
examples of refrigerants used for this purpose include 
ammonia, carbon dioxide gas, chlorofluorohydrocarbon 
(hereinafter occasionally referred to as "CFC") gases, that 
is, Freon (Flon) gases (i.e., fluorine-containing carbonized 
compounds) such as R-11, R-12, R-13, R-21, R-22, R-113, R-114, 
R-500 and R-502, propane, etc. CFC gases, that is, Freon gases, and ammonia are mainly 
used as refrigerants. Freon gases are also used as an 
azeotropic refrigerant which is formed by mixing together 
two different kinds of Freon gas but functions as if it were 
comprised of only one kind of Freon gas. However, ammonia 
is a toxic, combustible and explosive gas although it is 
excellent in refrigerant characteristics such as 
refrigerating capacity. Moreover, ammonia corrodes copper 
and a copper alloy when air and water content get mixed in 
it. In contrast, Freon refrigerants are excellent in 
refrigerant characteristics such as refrigerating capacity 
as well as non-combustible and non-explosive, and they are 
neither corrosive with respect to metals nor toxic to the 
human body. Accordingly,
