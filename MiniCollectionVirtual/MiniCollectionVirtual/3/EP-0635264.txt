<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of reducing 
blood glucose levels in humans, particularly those 
afflicted with diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disease 
characterized by disorders in the actions of insulin and 
other regulatory hormones in the metabolism of 
carbohydrates, fats and proteins, and in the structure and 
function of blood vessels. The primary symptom of diabetes 
is hyperglycemia, often accompanied by glucosuria, the 
presence in urine of large amounts of glucose, and 
polyuria, the excretion of large volumes of urine. 
Additional symptoms arise in chronic or long standing 
diabetes. These symptoms include degeneration of the walls 
of blood vessels. Although many different organs are 
affected by these vascular changes, the nerves, eyes and 
kidneys appear to be the most susceptible. As such, long-standing 
diabetes mellitus, even when treated with insulin, 
is a leading cause of blindness. There are two recognized types of diabetes. 
Type I diabetes is of juvenile onset, ketosis-prone, 
develops early in life with much more severe symptoms and 
has a near-certain prospect of later vascular involvement. 
Control of this type of diabetes is difficult and requires 
exogenous insulin administration. Type II diabetes 
mellitus is of adult onset, ketosis-resistant, develops 
later in life, is milder and has a more gradual onset. One of the most significant advancements in the 
history of medical science came in 1922 when Banting and 
Best demonstrated the therapeutic effects of insulin in 
diabetic dogs. However, even today, a clear picture of the 
basic biochemical defects of the disease is not known, and 
diabetes remains a serious health problem. It is believed  
 
that two percent of the United States' population is 
afflicted with some form of diabetes. The introduction of 
orally effective hypoglycemic agents was an important 
development in the treatment of hyperglycemia. Oral 
hypoglycemic agents are normally used in the treatment of 
adult onset diabetes. Observations in animal models on glucose 
metabolism for type II diabetes and in humans suggest that 
sex steroids play a permissive role in the phenotypic 
expression of hyperglycemia. These observations have 
prompted studies on the effects of androgens and estrogens 
on blood glucose levels. Testosterone administration to 
intact or ovarectomized female rats resulted in marked 
insulin resistance which correlated to morphological 
changes in muscle, Holmang, et al., Am. J. Physiol., 259,
