<ABSTRACT>
A borescope has an inverting dove prism (24) 
mounted on an ocular mount (12) proximally of an 

ocular lens (11). The ocular mount is axially 
adjustable by rotation of a collar (26) to achieve 

focusing and is rotatable about the axis independently 
of the focus position in unison with orbital scanning 

of a reflector (7) at the distal end of the 
borescope. Location of the dove prism proximally of 

the ocular lens avoids the need to include an invertor 
within the optical relay of insertion tube (2) thereby 

avoiding aperture reduction and simplifying assembly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for use as a
borescope of the orbital scanning type.It is known to provide such borescopes in which a
reflector is rotatably mounted to achieve lateral
viewing in a direction which can be orbitally
scanned. Typically the reflector is associated with a
window at a distal end of a tube of the borescope
suitable for insertion into inaccessible areas, the
tube typically containing an optical relay which
transfers an image reflected by the reflector to a
viewing means within a housing to which the tube is
connected.Since the reflector provides a mirror image of
the object being viewed it is customary to include an
image inverter such as a dove prism to correct the
image and typically such an inverter is included
within the tube as part of the optical relay. A
disadvantage of such an arrangement is that when
positioning the inverter between the lenses of the
optical relay the size of the inverter is limited to
that of the diameter of the relay lenses. Its shape
then restricts the amount of light that can be
transmitted through the optical relay or in other
words the effective aperture of the inverter is less
than that of the optical relay. The brightness of the
viewed image is thereby reduced.A further problem is that the performance of the
borescope is sensitive to any slight misalignment of
the inverter thereby creating difficulties in
achieving correct assembly during manufacture since
readjustment may require dissassembly of the optical 
relay.EP-A-0374031 discloses an endoscope which
consists of a tube, the distal end of which is
insertable into a remote or inaccessible location and
the proximal end of which is connected to a housing.
A viewing window and reflector are provided at the
distal end of the tube for viewing a laterally
positioned object and image relaying means is provided
to relay an image of the object to a camera at the
proximal end. The tube and reflector can be rotated
to provide orbital scanning and an inverter is
provided to correct inversion of the image created by
the reflector. The inverter is mounted in the housing
and can also be rotated, although separately to
rotation of the tube and reflector. According to the present invention there is
disclosed apparatus for use as a borescope comprising
a tube having a distal end which is insertable in use
into an inaccessible location and a proximal end
connected to a housing, a viewing port adjacent the
distal end and an associated reflector through which
an object at the inaccessible location may be
late
