<ABSTRACT>
A metal wood golf clubhead is formed from a mold which 
includes an external gate into which molten metal is poured and 

internal gates in the mold cavity which facilitate flow of the 
molten metal into all portions of the mold cavity. The internal 

gates are located in the portion of the mold cavity which forms 
the interior surface of the top of the clubhead.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to metal wood golf clubs, and, 
more particularly, to a metal wood golf club which includes a 
permanently attached internal gate. Metal wood golf clubheads are conventionally formed by 
investment casting using the lost wax process. A wax impression 
of the hollow clubhead is made, and a mold is formed around the 
was impression. The wax is melted and removed to form a mold 
cavity in the mold. The wax impression includes a gate portion 
which forms a gate or passage in the mold which connects the 
mold cavity to the exterior of the mold. The gate is usually 
located at the toe or heel portion of the clubhead. Molten metal is poured into the gate of the mold and 
flows into the mold cavity. After the metal cools to form the 
clubhead, the mold is broken up and cleaned away from the 
clubhead. The solid metal which occupied the gate portion is 
removed from the clubhead, and the gate area is ground and 
buffed to provide a smooth exterior surface. The size of metal wood clubheads has increased in 
recent years, and larger clubheads often require additional 
external gates on the crown or top of the clubhead and/or the 
skirt or sides of the clubhead in addition to the main external 
gate to facilitate flow of molten metal throughout the mold 
cavity, to improve casting, and to reduce surface porosity on 
the molded clubhead. The external gates require additional 
processing steps and additional material and form molded metal 
material which must be removed from the cast clubhead.  The invention utilizes internal gates in the mold which 
form gate material on the interior surfaces of the molded 
clubhead. The interior gate material does not need to be 
removed from the clubhead and remains as a permanent part of the 
clubhead. The internal gates provide the following benefits: 
1. No need to construct separate gate molds. 2. No need to wax inject separate gate runners. 3. No need to wax assemble the gate runners to the wax 
pattern. 4. A reduction in the total quantity of wax used. 5. Increased wax set-up throughput by reducing 
individual mold assemble time. 6. A reduction in the total quantity of shell material 
used. 7. A reduction in the total quantity of metal poured 
for each head. 8. Elimination of multiple gate cut-off points. 9. Elimination of the need to grind the additional 
gate areas. 10. Provides a more uniform external surface and 
reduces the need for heavy belting of the external surface. 11. Reduces the total quantity of grinding belts used. The invention will be

<CLAIMS>
A cast metal wood clubhead having a face wall, a 
toe wall, a heel wall, a top wall, and a side wall extending 

from the toe wall to the heel wall below the top wall, each of 
said walls having exterior and interior surfaces to provide said 

clubhead with an interior chamber, a portion of said toe wall or 
heel wall providing a gate area, at least one internal gate 

extending from said gate area to the interior surface of the top 
wall and extending along the interior surface of the top wall. 
The clubhead of claim 1 including a plurality of 
said internal gates, one of the internal gates extending along 

the top wall near the side wall, another external gate extending 
along the top wall between the side wall and the face wall. 
The clubhead of claim 1 in which said gate area is 
on the heel wall, said internal gate
 extending from said gate 
area along the heel wall and along the side wall to the top 

wall. 
The clubhead of claim 1 in which said gate area is 
on the toe wall, said internal wall extending from said gate 

area along the toe wall to the top wall. 
A method of casting a metal wood clubhead 
comprising the steps of:

 
   forming a wax impression of the clubhead, the wax 

impression including a face wall, a toe wall, a heel wall, a top 
wall, a side wall extending from the toe wall to the heel wall 

below the top wall, an external gate portion extending outwardly 
from either the toe wall or the heel wall, each of said walls 

having exterior and interior surfaces to provide said wax 
impression with an interior chamber, and at least one internal 

gate extending from the interior surface of the wall on which 
the external gate is located to the interior surface of the top 

wall and extending along the interior surface of the top wall, 
   forming a mold over the exterior and interior surfaces 

of the wax impression, 
   melting the wax to provide a mold cavity in the mold, 

the mold cavity having an external gate passage formed by the 
external gate of the wax impression and at least one internal 

gate groove provided by the internal gate of the wax impression, 
   pouring molten metal into the external gate passage of 

the mold so that the molten metal flows into the mold cavity and 
the internal gate groove, 

   allowing the metal to cool to form a metal clubhead 
having an external gate portion and an internal gate portion, 

   removing the mold from the clubhead, and 
   removing the external gate portion from the clubhead 

but not the internal gate portion.
