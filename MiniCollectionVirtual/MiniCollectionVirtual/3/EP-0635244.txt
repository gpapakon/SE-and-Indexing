<ABSTRACT>
A bipolar electrosurgical scissors instrument 
comprising a proximal portion having a proximal linear axis 

and a distal blade portion having blade members (60,62) with a 
nonlinear axis in relation to the proximal linear axis. 

The blade members each comprise an electrically conductive 
outer surface (86,87) and an electrically nonconductive inner 

surface (91,92), with the inner surface comprising a ceramic layer 
having a honed cutting edge. At least one, and preferably 

both, of the blade members can pivot in relation to each 
other. Pivoting of the blade members causes the honed 

cutting edge of the first blade member to wipe the honed 
cutting edge of the second blade member to thereby cause 

separation of tissue therebetween. The blade members in 
one preferred embodiment are curved in relation to the 

proximal linear axis, while the blade members in a second 
preferred embodiment are angled in relation to the proximal 

linear axis. In this manner the proximal linear-axis 
portion of the scissors instrument does not obscure the 

visualization of the blade members during performance of a 
surgical procedure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to surgical scissors, 
and in particular to a bipolar scissors instrument wherein 
the axis of distal blade members thereof is nonlinear in 
relation to a linear axis of the instrument proximal to the 
blade members. Electrocauterization is a process whereby blood 
vessels (commonly called "bleeders") in tissue or alone 
which are cut during a surgical procedure are sealed closed 
by applying electrical energy at the site to, essentially, 
fuse by heat the vessel opening. In order to provide 
electrical energy at the site of bleeding, an instrument 
capable of conducting electricity must be placed at that 
site. The conductive instrument may be comprised of one 
electrode (monopolar) which cooperates with a remote 
conductive body plate electrode, or the instrument may be 
comprised of two closely spaced electrodes (bipolar). 
Current passing from one electrode to the other produces 
the heat sufficient to seal blood vessels or to coagulate 
blood and other fluids. A bipolar instrument is generally 
preferred by a physician since current travel is over a 
short distance. A monopolar instrument usually requires 
electric current to travel a relatively long distance to 
the body plate electrode, with current directability and 
effect being unpredictable and possibly harmful to a 
patient. Surgical scissors are known in the art. Those 
available for use in endoscopically performed surgeries or 
other similar scope procedures are of a size to fit 
distally through the scope while having operating handles 
proximally of the scope. Generally, the scissors include 
a proximal scissors type handle, a central hollow tube 
through which a linkage from the handle passes, and a 
distal blade pair to which the linkage connects. Copending  
 
and commonly assigned patent application Serial No. 
          , filed          , and 
entitled "BIPOLAR ELECTRICAL SURGICAL SCISSORS," teaches a 
bipolar scissors instrument wherein both of the blades 
thereof pivot in relation to each other. A ceramic layer 
is present on each of the respective inner surfaces of each 
blade member, and insulation means at strategic sites 
throughout the instrument maintain bipolar capability for 
the separate blade members. The central hollow tube 
described above and the distal blade pair lie in a single 
linear axis. Such a single axis can create a visibility 
problem in some circumstances since a view of the blade 
members may be obstructed by the immediately-proximal 
portion of the instrument because it is
