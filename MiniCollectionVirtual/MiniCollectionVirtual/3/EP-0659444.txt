<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for pumping blood and has, in addition to a pulsing blood pump element, an active clamping valve (14, 15) at the intake side and the delivery side of the pump element, respectively, and at least one sensor section (13) on the delivery side, in which section there are sensors which function without contact and which measure pressure and flow rate. A control unit (11) registers pressure and flow rate via the sensor signals and controls the clamping valves (14, 15) and a pump (9) which raises or lowers the pressure in a housing (2) of the blood pump. A flexible vessel provided in the housing, preferably a pressure bladder (1), is compressed or expanded by the changes in pressure and in this way delivers blood in a pulsing manner. Tube attachments (3, 4) which are secured on the pressure bladder (1) lead from the pressure-sealed housing (2) outwards and to the sensor section (13) and to the clamping valves (14, 15) and allow the rest of the circuit to be connected.

Device for pumping blood in an extracorporeal blood
circuit having


a) a flexible receptacle (1) which possesses

a1) an inlet connection (3) to which a hose
line of the extracorporeal blood circuit can be connected

or if need be is connected and through which the blood can
be fed into the flexible receptacle, and
a2) an outlet connection (4) to which a hose
line of the extracorporeal blood circuit can be connected

or if need be is connected and through which the blood is

carried away from the flexible receptacle,
b) a pressure-tight sealed housing (2)

b1) in which the flexible receptacle (1) is
accommodated in such a way that the connections (3, 4) or

the hose lines connected thereto lead to the outside
through openings provided in the housing, and
b2) which possesses a pressure medium
connection (10) for feeding a gaseous pressure medium

altering the internal pressure of the housing,
c) a pump (9) which is connected to the pressure
medium connection (10) of the housing (2) for the

conveyance of the gaseous pressure medium,
d) a sensor section (13)

d1) which is arranged outside the housing on
the outlet connection (4) or the hose line connected

thereto and
d2) which possesses sensors for detecting the
pressure and rate of flow of the blood,
e) two active clamping valves (14, 15)

e1) which are arranged outside on the
connections (3, 4) of the flexible receptacle (1) or the

hoses lines connected thereto and
e2) which determine the opening cross-section 
of the connections or of the hose lines by mechanical

action from outside, and
f) a control unit (11) to which the pump (9), the
sensors of the sensor section (13) and the active clamping

valves (14, 15) are connected for controlling the pump and
the clamping valves with respect to the pressure detected

by the sensors and the flow rate detected by the sensors,
the control unit controlling the closing and opening times

and speeds of the clamping valves.
Device according to Claim 1,

   characterised in that

the active clamping valves (14, 15) possess a
movable closure member (16, 17) which is moved by an

electric, electromagnetic, pneumatic or hydraulic drive
(18, 19) and a counter-support (20, 21) which is arranged

opposite the closure member (16, 17) in the direction of
motion in such a way that it works together with the

closure member in the determination of the opening cross-section
of the connections or of the hose lines connected

thereto and its position is adjustable with respect to the
position of the closure member determining the smallest

opening cross-section.
Device according to Claim 2,

   characterised in that

in the active clamping valves (14, 15) a spindle
screw (22, 23) for fixing the position of the counter-support

(20, 21) is provided.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

   characterised in that

a further sensor section (12), which is arranged
outside on the inlet connection (3) or the hose line

connected thereto, is provided which possesses sensors for
the detection of the pressure and rate of flow of the blood

and the sensors of which are connected to the control unit
(11).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

   characterised in that

a bubble detector is provided at least in the
sensor section (13) on the outlet connection (4) or the

hose line connected thereto and is connected to the control
unit (11).
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

   characterised in that

on the outlet side of the housing (2) the active
clamping valve (15) is arranged behind the sensor section

(13) in the direction of flow.
Device according to one of Claims 4 to 6,

   characterised in that

on the inlet side of the housing (2) the active
clamping valve (14) is arranged ahead of the sensor section

(12) in the direction of flow.
Device according to one of the preceding claims

   characterised in that

the housing (12) possesses sealing members (7, 8)
at the openings.
Device according to one of the preceding claims,

   characterised in that

the housing (2) is manufactured from a transparent
material.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims,

   characterised in that

the housing is a chamber (24) capable of being
swung open which possesses a cover part (25) and a base

part (26) which are connected to one another in swivelling
manner via a hinge (29) and possess sealing members at

their edges and which are locked by means of rocker-arm
locks (30, 31).
Device according to one of the preceding
claims,

   characterised in that

on the connections (3, 4) or the hose lines
connected thereto in the region of the passage through the

openings of the housing (2) a bush (5, 6) preferably made
of rigid plastic is arranged outside and is connected,

preferably bonded, to the outlet or the hose line.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims,

   characterised in that

the connections (3, 4) are constructed in the
