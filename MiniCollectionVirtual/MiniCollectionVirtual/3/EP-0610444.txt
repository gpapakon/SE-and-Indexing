<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to use of certain polyhydroxy phenyl compound in 
the production of medicaments for use in suppressing the 
growth or reproduction of DNA viruses and of retroviruses in 
mammals infected by one or more of such viruses. The term 
"DNA virus" is defined as being a virus with a DNA genome and 
the term "retrovirus" is defined as being a RNA virus having a 
reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) within the 
virion, according to the TEXTBOOK OF HUMAN VIROLOGY, 2nd ed. 
R. B. Belshe Ed., (Mosby, St. Louis 1991). Among the DNA 
viruses whose growth is suppressed in vivo by the therapeutic 
processes of this invention are included the Paroviruses which 
can infect both rodents (Kilham's virus, Aleutian mink 
disease), feline, dogs and humans (Parovirus strain B19 and RA-1 
virus), the Papovaviruses which include the Papilloma viruses 
which can cause human papilloma (warts) and infect rabbits 
(Shope papillomavirus), and the Polyomaviruses which infect 
primates (vacuolating virus of Rhesus monkeys and JC and BK 
viruses of man). JC virus is associated with progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Other DNA viruses which 
can have their in vivo growth in mammals suppressed by the 
processes of this invention include the Adenoviruses which 
cause acute respiratory diseases, febrile catarrhs, pharyngitis 
and conjunctivitis of man, the Herpes viruses which causes both 
latent and persistent infection in man including Epstein-Barr 
herpesvirus (Lymphocryptovirus) associated with human Burkitt's 
lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and causes infectious 
mononucleosis in man; Herpes simplex which causes both fever  
 
blisters and genital herpes among other human diseases as well 
as chicken pox, Simian B virus, often fatal to man; Herpes 
zoster (Varicellovirus) which causes shingles in man; 
Betaherpes viruses which are associated with cytomegalic 
inclusion disease and infection of T and B cell leukocytes; the 
hepadnaviruses which, upon infection in man are associated with 
hepatitis, hepatocellular carcinoma and immunecomplex-mediated 
extrahepatic injury including both hepatitis B and C, and, in 
domestic animals, swine pseudorabies as well as other viruses 
which cause disease in both cattle and horses. Retroviral 
diseases which are treatable by the therapeutic processes of 
this invention include the RNA tumor viruses (oncoviruses) and 
the slow viruses (lentiviruses). Specific oncovirus diseases 
include, in man, T-cell leukemia, human T-cell lymphotropic 
viru
