<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for implanting a medical prosthesis (1) in a duct of a human or animal body. This device comprises a tubular sheath (8) designed to contain the prosthesis to be implanted, and a rod (24) for controlling the prosthesis, which rod can slide inside the sheath. The sheath and/or the rod is (are) provided over at least a part of its (their) length with flexible centring means (54) capable of acting on the profile of the axial line of the sheath, and forcing its distal end (82) to align substantially with the axis of the duct (2) when the sheath is arranged therein. The invention finds its particular application in the field of blood filters which can be implanted in a blood vessel.
