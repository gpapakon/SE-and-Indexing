<ABSTRACT>
An IC card in which an IC chip is incorporated between a first 
and second base boards, comprises an image receiving layer on 

which an ink image is transferred by a thermal transfer method 
and a cushion layer provided between the IC chip and the image 

receiving layer so that the cushion layer smooths irregularity 
caused by the IC chip and improves a flatness of the image 

receiving layer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an IC card in which image information is formed on a surface of the base board
having ICs, and more particularly relates to an IC card having image information of high quality formed by means of
thermal transfer.Conventionally, an IC card shown in Fig. 4 is well known.In Fig. 4, numeral 1 is a base board of a plastic card on which ICs are mounted. On a surface of the base board of
this IC card, character and image information 7 such as an employee's number, name of the employee, date of issue
and term of validity is recorded. This character and image information 7 is protected when a transparent sheet 10 is
thermally pressed on the surface of the IC card. Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection No. 4480/1992
discloses the following technique:
At a point of time when information is provided, the information is recorded on the surface of the card. Then the surface
is coated with ultraviolet-ray-hardening type coating by which a transparent or translucent film is formed. In this way,
information can be recorded on the IC card even after the card has been manufactured.However, according to the conventional method, the quality of information recorded on a previously manufactured
IC card is not competent. For example, concerning the surface condition of an IC card, there is a difference between a
portion in which the ICs are mounted and a portion in which the ICs are not mounted, with respect to the hardness, heat
conductivity, thermal shrinkage factor and the like. For this reason, after the IC card has been subjected to thermal
press, irregularities and unevenness are caused on the surface of the IC card, which is not appropriate for recording
information.For example, even when the surface of the IC card is flat and smooth; excellent printing characteristics can not be
provided because the surface is hard. Especially when information to be recorded is a piece of image information such
as a portrait photograph having gradation properties, and when the information is recorded on the IC card by means of
thermal transfer, problems are caused in the image reproduction.From the viewpoint of preventing forgery, it is necessary to competently protect information recorded on the IC card.
However, according to the conventional method in which a resin layer having thermal adhesion property is thermally
transferred onto the IC card, information can not be competently protected. Accordingly, there is a possibility that information
is subjected to forgery. The conventional

<CLAIMS>
A card in which an IC (integrated circuit) chip is
incorporated, comprising:


first and second base boards which are constructed so as
to form the card;
the IC chip incorporated between the first and second
base boards;
an image receiving layer on which an ink image is
transferred by a thermal transfer method, the image receiving

layer disposed on an outside of the first base board; and
a cushion layer provided between the IC chip and the
image receiving layer so that the cushion layer smoothes

irregularity caused by the IC chip and improves a flatness of
the image receiving layer,

   wherein the cushion layer is disposed between the first
base board and the image receiving layer. 
The card of claim 1 wherein the cushion layer is polyolefine.
The card of claim 1, wherein the cushion layer has a thickness of 2 to 200 µm.
The card of claim 1, wherein the cushion layer has a thickness of 5 to 50 µm.
The card of claim 1, wherein the cushion layer has a softening point lower than that of the base board.
The card of claim 5, wherein the softening point of the cushion layer is lower than the base board by 10 °C or more.
The card of claim 1, wherein the base board is made of biaxial orientation polyester film.
The card of claim 1 wherein the IC chip is located on one section of the card and the ink image is transferred on
the other section of the card.
The card of claim 1 wherein the ink image is a halftone image.
The card of claim 1, wherein a writing layer on which information is written is provided on an outside of the second
base board.
The card of claim 1, wherein a hard overlay layer to smooth irregularity caused by the IC chip is provided between
the base board and the IC chip.
The card of claim 1, wherein, after the ink image is transferred on the image receiving layer, an intermediate protective
layer is provided on the ink layer and an ultraviolet ray hardening layer is provided on the protective layer. 
The card of claim 1, wherein the base boards and the cushion layer contain a white pigment.
