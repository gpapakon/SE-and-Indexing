<ABSTRACT>
A milling cutter tool for chip-breaking machining 
comprises a rotatable milling cutter body (1) and a 

plurality of cassettes (4) with cutting inserts, which 
cassettes are fixed in the cutter body by fastening 

screws (10). An axial adjustment of the cassettes and 
the cutting edges can be made with eccenter taps (11). 

In order to facilitate the manufacturing of the chip 
pockets (8), these are made rotation-symmetrically, 

preferrably by turning.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a milling cutter 
body for chip-breaking machining and a process for the 
manufacturing of said body. A typical milling cutter tool comprises a cutter 
body that can be fixed at the end of a driving rotating 
axle and a plurality of cutting edges which are carried 
by the milling cutter body on a certain radial distance 
from the axis of rotation on that side of the body that 
is distanced from the driving axle, so that when the 
body is rotated the cutting edges describe a circle 
around the axial central axis of rotation. All parts of 
the milling cutter tool are situated axially and 
radially behind the cutting edges so that these have an 
unobstructed access to the workpiece. Since the cutting 
edges are relatively short, each of them performs a 
relatively short cutting operation, wherefore the tool 
is used with a certain feed, the direction of this feed 
being parallel to the machined surface. The cutting edges are constituted by one or 
several edges on cutting inserts which can be made of 
coated or non-coated cemented carbide, ceramics or any 
other hard material. These cutting inserts are located 
on the top surfaces of cassettes which are fixed in 
grooves or recesses in the circular peripheric surface 
of the cutter body. In order to make room and enhance 
an unobstructed and even chip conveyance, the 
interspaces or gaps in the cutter body between the 
cassettes are usually provided with chip clearance 
recesses or chip pockets, whereby the chip pocket is 
situated in front of the pertaining cutting edge in the 
direction of rotation. At the production of the cutter 
body, these chip pockets are formed by milling or  
 
grinding. Occasionally, the chip pocket, or a part 
thereof, can be formed in the cassette. Thus, in US-A-5 114 282 a milling cutter body is 
disclosed, in which each chip pocket has been milled 
out individually. This means equally many milling 
operations as there are chip pockets, i.e., about ten 
or more. This is both time and energy consuming. In EP-B-65 496 and EP-B-126 432 milling cutters 
are disclosed in which the chip pockets are formed by 
recesses or vaulted parts in the wedges for fixing the 
cutting inserts. This requires many separate fastening 
parts and also the inconvenience of having to produce 
many small parts with a complicated geometrical form. A first object of the present invention is thus to 
guarantee a satisfactory chip conveyance without the 
necessity of time- and energy-consuming chip clearance 
constructions.
