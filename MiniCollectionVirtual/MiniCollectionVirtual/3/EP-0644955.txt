Title: METHOD FOR PREPARING ORGANIC AND INORGANICHYDROXIDES AND ALKOXIDES BY ELECTROLYSISBackground of the Invention This invention relates to a method of preparing organic and inorganic hydroxides and alkoxides by electrolysis. The invention also relates to the high purity hydroxides obtained by the method of the invention.Background of the InventionQuaternary ammonium hydroxides such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAH), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) are strong organic bases that have been known for many years. Such quaternary ammonium hydroxides have found a variety of uses including use as titrants for acids in organic solvents and as supporting electrolytes in polarography. Aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium hydroxides, particularly TMAH solutions, have been used extensively as a developer for photoresists in printed circuit board and microelectronic chip fabrication. Use of quaternary ammonium hydroxides in the electronics area requires that there be no residue following the normal post-bake period. In electronic applications, it is desirable that the aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium hydroxides should be essentially free from metal ions such as sodium and potassium, and halides such as chloride, bromide, iodide, etc. Particularly in recent years, there has been an increasing demand for quaternary ammonium hydroxides having a high purity.Quaternary ammonium hydroxides such as TMAH and TEAH have been produced by various techniques. Generally, the quaternary ammonium 

hydroxides are manufactured by electrolyzing a salt of a quaternary ammonium compound in an electrolysis cell containing a diaphragm formed of a cation-exchange membrane. The quaternary ammonium salts used in such preparations include halide salts, carboxylate salts, carbonate salts and sulfate salts. When halide salts are used in the manufacture of quaternary ammonium hydroxide, it has been discovered that the quaternary ammonium hydroxide solutions formed by this method generally contain significant amounts of halogen (ionic and latent), generally in concentrations from about 30 ppm up to about 100 ppm at 2.8 M quaternary ammonium hydroxide (e.g., TMAH). The term "latent halide" refers to nonionic halogen which is present in the aqueous quaternary ammonium hydroxide solutions and which is capable of forming halide ions under certain conditions such as heating.Among the prior art patents which describe the preparation of quaternary
