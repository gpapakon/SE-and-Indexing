<DESCRIPTION>
 ACOUSTIC ADMINISTRAΉON OF REMEDIES PROCESSANDDEVICEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the treatment 5 of diseases and more particularly to the use of sound waves of a certain frequency and amplitude to administer a remedy for disease treatment. The frequency and amplitude of the sound waves correspond to the frequency and amplitude of the electro-magnetic oscillations given10 off by the remedy.The treatment of a diagnosed disease is an art which has been practiced throughout the history of man. Thousands of different remedies have been administered in many different ways. Medical science in the15 twentieth century has taught that selected pharmaceutical remedies (i.e. drugs) can chemically counteract the effects of almost any disease. Conventional drugs generally produce a predictable effect on the diseased organ or on the disease-causing20 pathogen. It is often not known exactly how the drug works within the body, just that the drug has a predictable effect.Homeopathic medicine, widely practiced in foreign countries, approaches disease treatment from a25 different perspective. Homeopathic medicine uses the principal that the body has natural disease-fighting mechanisms, which can be properly stimulated to themselves combat a disease. Homeopathic remedies are substances found in nature which stimulate the body*s30 own disease-fighting mechanisms. Rather than have a foreign drug fight the disease within the body, the homeopathic remedy aids the body's own disease-fighting chemistry in fighting the disease. 

 Ho eopathic remedies, when taken in a large dosage, often have the capacity to produce the same symptoms as the disease. Introduction of a minute dosage can alert the body's disease-fighting mechanisms to the presence of a disease and focus the disease- fighting mechanisms toward fighting the disease.Recently it has been theorized that the effectiveness of some medicines is related to the electro-magnetic oscillations or waves given off by the medicines. This is thought to be particularly true with homeopathic remedies. A homeopathic remedy gives off electro-magnetic oscillations of a particular frequency and amplitude, and the oscillations stimulate the body's natural disease-fighting chemistry to combat the disease.Equipment has been designed to produce an electronic signal having a frequency and amplitude which corresponds to the electro-magnetic oscillations given off by a remedy. The electronic signal is then transmitted to the body of the patient. This practice is

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS;
1. A process for the treatment of disease comprising the steps of: receiving the electro-magnetic oscillations produced by a remedy for a disease; converting the electro-magnetic oscillations of the remedy into an electronic signal which corresponds to the electro¬ magnetic oscillations both in frequency and in amplitude; transmitting the electronic signal to a speaker thereby driving the speaker to produce sound waves which correspond to the electronic signal both in frequency and in amplitude; and contacting a patient having the disease with the sound waves at a treatment effective intensity.
2. The process of Claim 1 wherein the step of receiving the electro-magnetic oscillations comprises the step of: receiving the electro-magnetic oscillations produced by a homeopathic remedy for a disease.
3. The process of Claim 2 wherein the step of contacting a patient having the disease with the sound waves comprises the step of: contacting a patient having the disease with the sound waves at an intensity such that the patient's natural disease- fighting chemistry is stimulated to better fight the disease. 


 4. The process of Claim 1 wherein the step of transmitting the electronic signal to a speaker comprises the steps of: recording the electronic signal on a recording medium, and playing the recording medium to recreate the electronic signal.
5. The process of Claim 4 wherein the step of recording the electronic signal on a recording medium comprises the step of: recording the electronic signal on a magnetic audio tape.
6. The magnetic audio tape produced by the process of Claim 5.
7. The process of Claim 1 wherein the step of converting the electro-magnetic oscillations of the remedy into an electronic signal comprises the step of: filtering the electronic signal to eliminate selected frequencies.
8. The process of Claim 1 wherein the step of contacting a patient having the disease with the sound waves continues for at least one session having a duration sufficient to effect an improvement.
9. The process of Claim 8 wherein a plurality of sessions are performed on different days.
10. The process of Claim 1 wherein the step of receiving the electro-magnetic oscillations comprises the step of: receiving the electro-magnetic oscillations from at least one member from the group consisting of:
Herpes Nosode, Tonical Injel, Ubichonon, CoEmzym, Silymarin, Nero Injel, Hepar Compositum, Reneel, and 


 Cerebrum Compositum, these members being homeopathic remedies for herpes. 11. A process for the treatment of disease comprising the steps of: receiving the electro-magnetic oscillations produced by a homeopathic remedy for herpes, wherein the homeopathic remedy is at least one member from the group consisting of:
Herpes Nosode, Tonical Injel, Ubichonon,
CoEmzym, Silymarin, Nero Injel,
Hepar Compositum, Reneel, and
Cerebrum Compositum, these members being homeopathic remedies for herpes; converting the electro-magnetic oscillations of the homeopathic remedy into an electronic signal which corresponds to the electro-magnetic oscillations both in frequency and in amplitude; filtering the electronic signal to eliminate selected frequencies; recording the electronic signal on a magnetic audio tape; playing the magnetic audio tape to recreate the electronic signal; transmitting the electronic signal to a speaker thereby driving the speaker to produce sound waves which correspond to the electronic signal both in frequency and in amplitude; and contacting a patient having herpes with the sound waves at a treatment effective 


intensity such that the patient's natural disease-fighting chemistry is stimulated to better fight herpes, wherein the sound waves contact the patient for a plurality of sessions each having a duration sufficient to effect an improvement.
