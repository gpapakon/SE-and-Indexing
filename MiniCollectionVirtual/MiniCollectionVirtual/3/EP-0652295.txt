<ABSTRACT>
In a process for the environmentally compatible recovery of aluminium and aluminium alloys from materials containing organic compounds, these materials are remelted in a sidewell melting furnace (10) having a melting chamber (12) and a main hearth (14) and the flue gases are purified. For this purpose the temperature in the main hearth (14) is set to at least 1200 DEG C. The flue gases are passed from the melting chamber (12) into the main hearth (14), held at this temperature for a delay time of at least 5 sec and then quenched to a temperature of less than 100 DEG C. An apparatus suitable for carrying out the process comprises a sidewell melting furnace (10) having a melting chamber (12) and main hearth (14). To quench the flue gases exiting from the main hearth (14), a quench (34) is provided downstream of the melting furnace (10). It is possible by means of the process and the apparatus to avoid in the exhaust gas dioxins and furans formed on remelting materials containing organic compounds and to comply with the limit value of 0.1 ng/m

 specified as a total value for dioxin and furan emissions in the seventeenth Ordinance on Implementation of the Federal Pollution Prevention Law of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Process for the non-polluting recuperation of aluminium
and aluminium alloys from materials containing organic

compounds by remelting in a Sidewell smelting furnace
(10) containing a smelting chamber (12) and the main

hearth (14) and cleaning of the flue gases where the
flue gases are guided from the smelting chamber (12)

into the main hearth (14)

characterised in that

the temperature (T
2
) in the main hearth (14) is set at
at least 1200°C, the flue gases in the main hearth (14)

are held at this temperature (T
2
) for a period (t) of
at least 5 seconds and then quenched to a temperature

(T
3
) of less than 100°C.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that the
temperature (T
2
) in the main hearth (14) is maintained
by combustion of gas, in particular natural gas, with

oxygen.
Process according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the atmosphere in the smelting furnace (10) is

regulated at a reduced pressure.
Process according to any of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that circulation of the liquid metal

is maintained from the main hearth (14) into the
smelting chamber (12) and back into the main hearth

(14).
Process according to any of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the flue gases are quenched with

water. 
Device for performance of the process according to any
of claims 1 to 5 with a Sidewell smelting furnace (10)

containing a smelting chamber (12) and a main hearth
(14), characterised in that after the smelting furnace

(10) is connected a quenching device (34) for quenching
the flue gases emerging from the main hearth (14).
Device according to claim 6, characterised in that
before the smelting chamber (12) is connected a feed

device (26) for feeding the smelting chamber (12),
where flue gases from the smelting furnace (10) can be

guided into the feed device (26) to dry the materials
to be remelted.
Device according to claim 5 or 7, characterised in that
between the smelting chamber (12) and the main hearth

(14) is arranged a transfer line (31) for transfer of
the flue gases from the smelting chamber (12) to the

main hearth (14).
Device according to any of claim 6 to 8, characterised
in that in the main hearth (14) are arranged gas oxygen

burners (28).
Device according to any of claims 6 to 9, characterised
in that for circulation of the liquid metal, a pumping

chamber (16) with a metal pump (18) is provided which
connects the main hearth (14) to the smelting chamber

(12).
