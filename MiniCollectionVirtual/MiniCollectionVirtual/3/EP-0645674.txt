<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a composition for
processing imagewise exposed color silver halide
elements and, in particular, to a rapid processing
method in which the desilvering performance is
improved.During processing of color silver halide
elements the silver is oxidized to a silver salt by a
bleaching agent, most commonly an iron-complex salt of
an aminopolycarboxylic acid, such as the ferric
ammonium complex salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA). The bleaching step is followed by removal
of this silver salt and any unused silver halide by a
fixing agent which renders the silver salts and silver
halide soluble. Bleaching and fixing may be effected
separately or together as a bleach-fixing step.The bleaching reaction rate strongly depends
on the oxidizing potential of the iron-complex salt
which in turn depends on the structure of the
aminopolycarboxylic acid. Compounds such as
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and
nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) afford iron complexes with
weak oxidizing strength. Rapid bleaching cannot be
attained without the use of added bleach-accelerating
compounds. On the other hand, some aminopolycarboxylic
acids can afford too strong an oxidizing strength which
leads to 1) unwanted dye formation in the bleach and,
2) if used in a bleach-fix, to poor solution stability
of the bleach-fix solution due to oxidation of the
fixing agents; such oxidation can cause precipitation
of sulfur in the solution. Furthermore, some of the 
chelating agents forming iron-complex salts are not
readily biodegradable in publicly-owned treatment works
or receiving waters.Bleaching solutions have been developed which
contain more than one ligand and which help provide
rapid bleaching without unwanted dye formation , but
such solutions contain two distinct iron-complex salts.
For example, in KODAK FLEXICOLOR Bleach II, one salt is
ferric ammonium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)
and the other is ferric ammonium-1,3-propylenediamine
tetraacetic acid (PDTA). While such mixtures are
stable and provide excellent bleaching, neither of
these iron-complex salts is readily biodegradeable.
Similarly in EP 430,000/DE 3,939,755 (Tappe et.al.),
bleach-fix formulations have been described with
mixtures of ligands. However, the ligands described
are both tetradentate chelating agents that form two
distinct iron-complex salts which, in combination with
thiosulfate in bleach-fix formulations, lack stability.
Also described in EP 534,086, (Kuse) are mixtures of
bidentate ligands, used
