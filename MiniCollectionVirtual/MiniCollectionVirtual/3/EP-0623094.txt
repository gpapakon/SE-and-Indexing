<ABSTRACT>
A microemulsion gel having antiseptic and bleaching properties is prepared from the combination of a water phase comprising water and propylene glycol with an oil phase generally comprising one or more surfactants, an emollient, and an oil. In its preferred embodiment, the oil phase comprises a polyethylene glycol ether of isocetyl alcohol, preferably Isoceteth-20 (trademark), a polyethylen glycol ether of oleyl alcohol, preferably Oleth-2 (trademark), a polypropylene glycol ether of stearyl alcohol, preferably PPG-15 stearyl ether (trademark). The water phase optionally includes sorbitol and the oil of the oil phase may be mineral oil. The water and oil phases are heated independently then combined and mixed. Hydrogen peroxide is subsequently added to the composition, and the combination is cooled and allowed to stand until a gel is formed. A fragrance may be added as desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition having bleaching and antiseptic
properties. More particularly, the present invention comprises the mixture of a water
phase, an oil phase and hydrogen peroxide.Hydrogen peroxide has long been used as an antiseptic and a bleach. When
used for these purposes, the hydrogen-oxygen compound is generally diluted to 3 to
6 percent by weight.The strong oxidizing properties of hydrogen peroxide render it an excellent
bleaching agent in both industrial and consumer applications. When employed in
industry, hydrogen peroxide is often used in the bleaching (and deodorizing) of textiles,
woods and paper pulp, fur, and food stuffs including flour, oils, fats, and sugar. By
reacting chemically with the discolouring components of the treated materials, these
components are oxidised or reduced to a colourless form or to a form which is soluble
and can be removed by subsequent washing.Consumer salon and home applications of hydrogen peroxide as a bleach are
most often directed to the bleaching or decolouring of human hair. When used in this
capacity, hydrogen peroxide is typically combined with other chemicals called
bleaching assistants to assume more uniform penetration of the hair by the bleach and
more complete control of the process.The consumer use of known hydrogen peroxide-containing compounds
provided for use as decolourisers of human hair is constrained by several undesirable
characteristics, the main problem being a general one of control. Hydrogen peroxide
is itself a thick, syrupy liquid that, along with the bleaching assistants, is sold as a
solution in water. The resulting "oil bleach" as it is called by beauticians, tends to be
overinvasive and easily contacts the scalp, skin and eyes. Because it is a strong irritant,
the unrestricted distribution of hydrogen peroxide can cause severe burning.A composition which allows more controlled use of hydrogen peroxide as a
hair bleach is known from United States Patent 4927627.Hydrogen peroxide also has valuable application as an antiseptic. As such it
is often applied to humans or animals to retard or stop the growth of microorganisms 
considered harmful. Hydrogen peroxide is viscous in pure form, but is generally
diluted to 3 percent by weight with water when used as an antiseptic. The resulting
solution is pervasive when applied as an antiseptic and tends to wander out of control.
This characteristic contributes to wasteful excess in application.Known methods of disinfecting skin and bleaching human hair have failed
