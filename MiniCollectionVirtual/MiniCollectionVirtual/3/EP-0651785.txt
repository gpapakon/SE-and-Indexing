<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel microorganisms.
More specifically, the invention relates to strains
of the novel alkalophilic species Bacillus sp. AC13.It is an object of the present invention to provide
novel microorganisms capable of expressing valuable novel
enzymes for industrial applications, as well as novel enzymes
of different kinds obtainable from these organisms.Accordingly, the invention provides isolated biologically
pure cultures of strains of the alkalophilic species
Bacillus sp. AC13.FEMS Microbiology Letters 1994, 117, p. 61-66
discloses comparative 16S rDNA analysis of some alkaliphilic
bacilli carried out by experts at DSM-Deutsche Sammlung von
Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Mascheroder Weg 1b, D-38124
Braunschweig, Germany. The novelty of the species
Bacillus sp. AC13, which was redeposited by the DSM under the
accession number DSM 8721, was verified and the species was
assigned the official name Bacillus agaradhaerens, see also
Microbiology, 1995, 141, 1745-1761, especially Table 1, PN105,
and page 1758, column 2, disclosing that DSM 8721 is now the
official type strain of the novel Bacillus species of the
present invention.The Bacillus species of the invention is capable of
expressing valuable novel enzymes for industrial applications
such as proteases, xylanases and cellulases which may be
useful eg in detergent compositions or in processes for
treatment of lignocellulosic pulp.In the accompanying drawings,
Fig. 1 shows the relative activity (% rel.) of a
protease from the novel microorganism of the invention at
various pH, determined at 25°C with casein as substrate; and Fig. 2 shows the relative activity (% rel.) of a
protease from the novel microorganism of the invention at 
various temperatures (▪ Buffer pH 9.5; □ Buffer pH 9.5
containing 0.1% STPP), determined at pH 9.5 with casein as
substrate. The present invention relates to microorganisms of
the novel alkalophilic species Bacillus sp. AC13, represented
by the type culture Bacillus sp. AC13, NCIMB 40482.The strain Bacillus sp. AC13, NCIMB 40482, has been
deposited on 3 March 1992 according to the Budapest Treaty on
the International Recognition of the Deposits of
Microorganisms for the Purpose of Patent Procedures, at
National Collections of Industrial and Marine Bacteria Ltd.,
23 St. Machar Drive, Aberdeen AB2 1RY, Scotland, UK, under
Accession No. NCIMB 40482.The microorganisms of this invention are aerobic,
rod shaped, spore forming bacteria, and therefore belonging to
the genus Bacillus.Morphologically
