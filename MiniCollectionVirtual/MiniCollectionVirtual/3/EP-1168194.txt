<ABSTRACT>
A keyword and/or keyword combination for searching, is entered by the user into a computer, i.e. the client, as a search criterion. The user allocates fuzzy logic values to search criteria (their anticipated effectiveness). The client downloads text information from computer(s), i.e. server(s) connected to the network. For each item found in accordance with the search criteria, a fuzzy logic value is calculated. The client calculates the significance of information found in accordance with the calculated fuzzy logic value. In accordance with the significance of the text information, it is supplied to the user by the client. An Independent claim is included for (1) the corresponding electronic data processing system. (2) program stored on machine-readable media.
