<ABSTRACT>
Slabs and plate-like products in form of tiles, mopboards and 
baseboards (40) 

of natural stones particularly granite, marble and porphyry are produced 
carrying out, in one of the surface (44) of the slab coming from the 

sawing 
operation by which the thickness of the slab is set less than 10mm., a 

grid pattern of reinforcing elements or members (46) of synthetic 
material 

anchored to slots or grooves carried out in said surface of said slab, 
said synthetic material being set in said slots, and then carrying out 

the usual manufacturing and finishing operations for natural stones on 
the face intended to remain visible of said slab whereafter, if 

desidered, 
the slab is cut into plate-like products at the meshes of said grid 

pattern, so that said plate-like products have a continuous or 
discontinuous framing of said reinforcing synthetic material; the framing 

is of triangular or rectangular cross-section with the maximum thickness 
near the outside edge of the plate-like product.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to new plate-like products of stone 
material, particularly granite, marble, porphyry and the like, useful for 
floorings and coverings of building works, as well as to a method and an 
apparatus for its execution. In the following description particular reference is made to granite and 
building floorings but it is obvious that this description has only an 
illustrative purpose and in any circumstance must not be intended in a 
limitative sense. For some time the industry of the materials for building floorings and 
particularly for residential buildings decidely tends towards elements of 
small thickness, the surface of which is already finished before the 
laying down so that only the laying is necessary. The small thickness (which in the present invention means a thickness not 
greater than 10 mm.) causes a reduction of material weight together with 
consequent advantages in terms both of transport expenses and of handling 
and thus of a greater easiness and rapidity for the laying. Nowadays, the modern design for buildings constantly tends to take it 
into account the existence of flooring materials, not only of thin 
thickness (such as for example the ceramic tiles) but also of thickness 
consistent with the thickness of the different materials which may be 
used. In fact, several advantages of economic and technical kind result from 
this approach. Firstly and principally, it is possible in this way to prepare only one 
laying bed lying on one level to be covered (upon the building works, as 
well as painting and installation works, are finished) with the selected 
flooring materials, thus permitting to postpone the choice of the 
materials and then their differentiation, depending on the intended 
purpose of the rooms and on the end user's preferences without the past 
influences caused by the differences of thickness from one material to 
another which sometimes is considerable and thereby permitting all the 
materials to be fixed by glueing onto the laying plane. Obviously the term glueing means in general to have the covering material 
adhering to the laying plane in a permanent way and with a prefixed  
 
detaching resistence. However, to date, this technique has prevalently used particular covering 
materials such as ceramic tiles, wood lists (parquet), moquette, 
synthetic or natural rubber slabs, plastic material slabs. As it may be 
easily noted, all these materials may be manufactured with a small 
thickness maintaining the handling resistence necessary
