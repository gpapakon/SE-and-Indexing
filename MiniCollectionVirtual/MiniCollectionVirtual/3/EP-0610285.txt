<ABSTRACT>
A composite ceramic fibre (10) is made from a self-supporting composite polymeric fibre by the conjugate spinning of at least two dissimilar pre-ceramic polymers in shapes varying from cylindrical to ribbon-like, and pyrolysing the spun fibre to form a composite bilateral, core-sheath or matrix-fibril ceramic fibre having regions with ceramic compositions derived from each of the polymers, enabling physical and chemical characteristics to be widely varied for use as matrix reinforcements and other applications. A pyrolysis furnace (14) includes countercurrent controlled atmosphere gas flow for chemically stabilising or modifying the fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
 CERA IC FIBRESThis invention relates to ceramic fibres. It is concerned with methods of making such fibres, and with the fibres so made, and with their uses.Ceramic compositions typically include oxides, carbides and nitrides of metals and non-metals, and extend more generally to simple binary or more complex solid inorganic compounds, excluding salts. Ceramics tend to result from high temperature processing which consolidates the material. Fibres containing ceramic compounds are referred to herein as ceramic fibres. Compounds which yield ceramics after pyrolysis, or firing, are referred to as ceramic precursors, or pre-ceramic materials. Fibres containing ceramic precursors, which after firing will form ceramic fibres, are referred to as pre-ceramic fibres.This invention is especially concerned with composite or multicomponent ceramic materials that include compounds between metals and non-metals; although ceramics including compounds wholly between non-metals, such as silicon carbide and boron nitride, are also made available by the invention. Glasses may be included among the ceramics, and the invention is applicable to non-glass ceramics and glassy ceramics as distinct classes of product.References to fibres are intended also to include filaments, ie long or continuous fibres. The fibres are generally manufactured as filaments. Short fibres can be made from the filaments by chopping or other processes.A particularly important use of ceramic fibres is as reinforcements for glass, metal and ceramic products, to prevent catastrophic failure of the products under stress. A serious problem can be that the fibre that in itself has good properties from a mechanical point of view may not be chemically or physically compatible with the matrix into which it is to 

 be incorporated as a reinforcement. Ceramic materials also have many other uses, and. show a very wide range of electrical properties, from insulators through semiconductors to superconductors.Known methods of making ceramic fibres include chemical vapour deposition and pyrolysis of a given polymer. The former 1s slow and expensive, and tends to give stoichiometric, monolithic. Inflexible fibres of large diameter. The latter gives monolithic nonstoichiometric fibres which are more flexible. Both give fibres that can be reactive with the matrix unless they are reprocessed to coat them.My International Patent Application PCT/6B91/00604, Publication No WO 91/16479, discloses methods of making a range of ceramic materials which can be tailored and
