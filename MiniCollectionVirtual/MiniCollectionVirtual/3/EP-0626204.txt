<ABSTRACT>
The device is used to accommodate and comminute foliage, hedge cuttings and similar garden waste. It travels as an independent vehicle or as a trailer and removes the material from the ground by means of brush-like receiving elements (9) on a rotating roller (8). From thence, the material is passed onto a metering device (5), which is composed of parallel shafts having radial elements (6). Adjustable metering is carried out by means of rotation in steps of the shafts, the material falling in larger or smaller quantities into a comminuting device (1). The material is comminuted by means of knives on a rotating drum (2) which moves past fixed counter cutters (3). The material falls through a grid (4) which is adjustable down onto the ground or into a receiving container.

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for comminuting organic material having the characteristics

in a housing there is provided at the top thereof a dosing device
(5) for receiving the material, the dosing device consisting of

two parallel shafts driven in a countercurrent manner and having
radial elements (6);
in the lower region of the housing there is provided a crushing
device consisting of a rotating drum (2, 31) with crushing elements

(1, 35) arranged approximately tangentially and associated
with stationary counter cutting edges (3, 37),

characterised by the following further features:

for the purpose of receiving and comminuting leaves, hedge
cuttings and other garden wastes, the housing is located on a

vehicle or on a trailer and combined with a device consisting of
a roller (8) on which radial pick-up elements (9) are provided

for the purpose of picking up the material from grass-plots and
feeding it to the dosing device.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that an adjustable
grid (4) is provided underneath the crushing device.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the dosing
device comprises in its radial elements (6) free spaces, stationary

elements wiping off the picked up material being associated with
these spaces.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the radial
pick-up elements are arranged on axial rails (10) in an exchangeable

manner.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the radial
elements are designed and arranged for the purpose of aerating and

scarifying grass-plots. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that in a lower
open region of the housing (20) there are arranged beating blades

(37) radially above each other and distributed over a semicircle.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 6, characterised in that the grid is
formed by exchangeable lattice bars.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, characterised by the following
characteristics:


The parallel shafts of the dosing device are connected by means
of intermeshing gear wheels (48, 49).
One gear wheel (48) is connected to a radial lever (46) by
means of a free-wheel in such a manner that it causes a rotation

of the gear wheels in the case of a downwardly directed pivot
movement, whereas in the case of an upwardly directed pivot

movement the gear wheels are standing still.
The lever (46) is connected to the drum shaft (40) by means of a
pull rod (42) and an eccentric bushing (41).
At the lever there are provided several hinged supports (45) for
the hinge connection to the pull rod.
