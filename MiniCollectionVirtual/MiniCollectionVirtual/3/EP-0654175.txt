<ABSTRACT>
In a power converter construction which consists of individual semiconductor modules (3, 4) and indirect capacitors (5, 6), the semiconductor modules (3) which are in thermal contact with the basic body (1) are secured to said rectangular basic body (1) along one longitudinal side. The indirect capacitors (6) are arranged upright on the underside of the basic body (1) along the second longitudinal side. In addition, there is a second basic body (2) on which the semiconductor modules (4) and the indirect capacitors (5) are arranged in the same manner. Both basic bodies (1, 2) are interconnected in such a way that the semiconductor modules (3, 4) are opposite each other. The indirect capacitors (5) on one basic body (2) are electrically connected to the semiconductor modules (3) on the other basic body (1). This power converter arrangement provides a very compact structure and the heat losses of the semiconductor modules (3, 4) are dissipated via the basic bodies (1, 2) in the best possible way.

An electric converter formed of 
semiconductor modules or intermediate circuit capacitors, 

with a first plurality of semiconductor modules (3) being 
fixed along a longitudinal edge on a first rectangular base 

body (1) and arranged in thermal contact with said first 
base body (1), and on the lower face thereof and along 

second longitudinal side thereof a first plurality of 
intermediate circuit capacitors (6) is vertically disposed, 

which is also in thermal contact with said first base body 
(1), and with a second base body (2) being provided on which 

a second plurality of semiconductor modules (4) and a second 
plurality of intermediate circuit capacitors (5) are 

similarly arranged, and in that both base bodies (1, 2) are 
connected together while overlapping one another along 

longitudinal sides thereof so that semiconductor modules (3, 
4) are oppositely disposed, and with intermediate circuit 

capacitors (5) on a first base body (2) being electrically 
connected to semiconductor modules (3) on the other base 

body (1). 
The electric converter as recited in claim 
1, characterized in that intermediate circuit capacitors 

(5, 6) are arranged into cavities (12) of base bodies 
(1, 2). 
The electric converter as recited in claim 1 
or 2, characterized in that semiconductor modules (3, 4) are 

connected to a printed circuit board (9), having the control 
device (7, 8) therefor and which is placed parallely to base 

bodies (1, 2). 
The electric converter as recited in one of 
claims 1-3, characterized in that each base body (1, 2) 

shows, in front of semiconductor modules (3, 4), 
longitudinal slots (10) which are connected together by 

transverse cavities in ledging area of base bodies (1, 2) 
and are closed, and in that base bodies (1, 2) are connected 

together so that said longitudinal slots (10) are oppositely 
placed, and in that there is respectively provided on front  

 
faces of said connected base bodies at least a perforation 

up to said transversal cavity, the center of which is 
located on the link between both base bodies (1, 2), and in 

that said perforations are provided for supplying and 
outletting a liquid refrigerant.
