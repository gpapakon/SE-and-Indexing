<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a platform for 
conducting electrophoresis with an electrophoresis 
plate, and to the electrophoresis plates used with the 
platform. The present invention is directed in general to 
the field of electrophoretic analysis of liquid 
samples, such as biological specimens. Valuable diagnostic information can be obtained by an 
analysis of certain biological fluids from a patient, such 
as blood serum. Electrophoresis is known to be an effective 
technique for separating the various components of 
such fluid for subsequent analyses using optical densitometry 
techniques. The physical phenomenon underlying 
electrophoretic analysis is that particles which have an 
effective electric charge and which are deposited on a 
solid or semi-solid medium are caused to move with respect 
to the medium by an electric field applied across the 
medium. Particles of different types move at different 
rates, so a mixture of different types of particles is 
separated into its different components or fractions by 
electrophoresis. These separated fractions may then be 
stained by exposing them to a suitable reagent so that the 
fractions can be optically detected using visible or ultraviolet 
light. The electrophoresis process has been performed through 
a series of manual steps for many years. The manual 
process typically has started with the operator preparing 
an electrophoresis chamber by filling appropriate cavities 
of the chamber with buffer solution. The electrophoretic 
medium is typically a gel substance such as polyacrylamide 
or agarose that has been coated onto a Mylar (trademark) 
substrate to form an electrophoresis plate. The liquid 
sample to be examined is typically blood serum, but of 
course may be other liquids.  Consistent volumes of the samples are applied to 
precise locations on the electrophoretic medium. Electrophoresis 
is then performed using a precise high voltage 
applied for a precise interval of time across the buffer 
cavities. After electrophoresis has been completed, the operator 
applies a uniform coating of a staining reagent, or stain, 
to the surface of the medium. The staining reagent chemically 
combines with the separated fractions of the fluid 
sample, causing the fractions to exhibit optical characteristics. Next, the separated fluid samples containing the stain 
are incubated, then dried, and then the samples are examined 
using optical densitometry techniques to determine 
which fractions were present in the original samples and to 
find their
