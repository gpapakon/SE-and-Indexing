<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus which serves to trigger an alarm and is intended for devices suitable for providing boundaries, which devices are provided with extension arms which can be swivelled about a horizontal axis and are interconnected by means of wires, a wire-shaped signal member passing through cutouts, arranged transversely with respect to the extension arms, in the extension arms. On the basis of the invention, it is to be achieved in the case of these devices that a signal is triggered reliably and that the signal member can be mounted on the extension arms in a considerably simplified fashion. For this reason, the extension arm and that part which serves to couple the extension arm each have a recess which is open at the edge, these recesses being offset with respect to each other in the region of their entry openings in such a way that the signal member can be inserted into the entry openings only by bending it.

Alarm triggering arrangement for apparatuses
suitable for defining boundaries, more especially fences,

which are provided with cross-piece members, which are
pivotable about horizontal axes and are interconnected by

wires, a wire-like signal component extending through
apertures, which are provided in the cross-piece members

and are disposed transversely relative to the cross-piece
members, and the signal component being able to be

influenced to trigger a signal as a result of a pivotal
movement of the cross-piece member, characterised in that

the cross-piece member (5) and the portion of the apparatus
used for the pivotal mounting of the cross-piece member

each have, over a portion of their length, preferably in
the end region, at least one open-edged recess (15,16), the

recesses serving to form the aperture (17) for the signal
component (7) and being offset from each other in the

region of their inlet apertures (18,20) in such a manner
that the signal component (7) is only insertable into the

inlet apertures (18,20) after bending.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the recesses (18,20) extend from the lower edge of the

cross-piece member (5), or respectively of the portion (3)
used for pivotal mounting.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the recesses are slots (15,16).
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the recesses (15,16) extend at an angle to each other,

one recess (16) being able to extend vertically and the
other recess (15) being able to extend inclinedly thereto.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the wire-like signal component (7) is adapted to 

trigger a signal by bending, e.g. it is a light-wave
conductor.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the cross-piece member (5) is mounted so as to be

pivotable to a limited extent.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the cross-piece member (5) is provided with a means,

e.g. a shear pin (13), which renders its initial pivotal
movement difficult and is mounted on the portion (3) used

for its pivotal mounting.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that a means, e.g. for assembly and repair purposes, is

associated with the cross-piece member (5) and prevents its
pivotal movement.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in
that the portion (3), used for pivotal mounting purposes,

or the cross-piece member (5) is disposed in the region of
the aperture (17) with a spacing (12) between two flanges

(11) of the other element (3,5).
Arrangement according to claim 9, characterised in
that the portion (3), which is used for pivotal mounting

purposes, has an integral, flat configuration (in the form
of a flat iron), while the cross-piece member (5) comprises

two flat portions (flanges 11), which extend outwardly in
the region of the aperture (17).
Arrangement according to claim 10, characterised in
that the upper portion (8) of the cross-piece member (5) is

kept hollow and is slipped over the flat portions (flanges
11). 
Arrangement according to claim 10, characterised in
that the two flat portions are the flanges (11) of a body,

which has a substantially U-shaped cross-section and a web
(10') which is disposed at the upper end and covers the

portion (3) used for pivotal mounting purposes.
