Assays for the DNA repair protein O

-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) are provided which employ monoclonal antibodies prepared using MGMT having transferase activity, as opposed to denatured MGMT or MGMT fragments. The monoclonal antibodies are able to recognize MGMT in single cell preparations (immunohistochemical staining assays) and in cell extracts (immunoassays). In connection with immunohistochemical staining, the use of a fluorescent readout coupled with digitization of the cell image allows for quantitative measures of MGMT levels in, for example, tumor biopsy samples. Such quantitative measures can be used to determine which patients are likely to benefit from chemotherapy using alkylating agents since tumor cells having low MGMT levels are more likely to be killed by such agents than those with high MGMT levels.

 ASSAYS FOR 0 -METHYLGUANINE-DNA METHYLTRANSFERASEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to the DNA repair proteins known as g O -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) and, in particular, to assays for detecting MGMT in a variety of biological preparations, including, most importantly, preparations containing single cells, e.g., cells fixed to microscope slides.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe MGMTs (EC 2.1.1.63; also referred to in the art as c O -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferases) are DNA repair proteins found in most 1-ving organisms which transfer alkyl groups from the 0-6 positic I of guanine in alkylated DNA to a cysteine residue of ".eir own polypeptide chains, thereby becoming catalytically inactive. Since each MGMT molecule acts but once, the repair capacity of a living cell is determined by the number of MGMT molecules in a cell at the time of DNA alkylation, and the rate of its resynthesiε.The MGMT levels of living cells are directly correlated with the response of those cells to S 2 alkylating agents, such as the clinically useful anti-cancer chemotherapeutic drug group, the chloroethylnitrosoureas. A group of human tumors and cell strains have the MER phenotype and are deficient in MGMT activity, and these tumors and cells are extremely sensitive to killing by theεe drugs. Various reviews of the MGMTs and their activity have appeared in the literature, including: DANIEL B. YAROSH, "THE ROLE OF 06-METHYLGUANINE-DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE IN CELL SURVIVAL, MϋTAGENESIS AND CARCINOGENESIS" , MUTATION RESEARCH. VOLUME 145, PAGES 1-16, 1985; ANTHONY E. PEGG, "PROPERTIES OF MAMMALIAN 06-ALKYLGUANINE-DNA ALKYLTRANSFERASE, MOTATION RESEARCH. VOLUME 233, PAGES 165-175, 1990; and ANTHONY E. PEGG, "MAMMALIAN 0S-ALKYLGUANINE-DNA ALKYLTRANSFERASE: REGULATION AND IMPORTANCE 

IN RESPONSE TO ALKYLATING, CARCINOGENIC AND THERAPEUTIC AGENTS", CANCER RESEARCH. VOLUME 50, PAGES 6119-6129, 1990, the relevant portions of which are incorporated herein by reference.Scientists in the field have long recognized that measurement of MGMT levels in human tumors would be an important contribution to improving chloroethylnitrosourea chemotherapy of cancer. For example, M. atatani, M. Ikenaga, T. Hatanaka, M.Kinuta, S. Takai, T. Mori and S. Kondo predicted in 1985 that "If the MER phenotype could be detected by some means in biopsy specimens, it should be possible to cure this type of malignant tumor by appropriate chemotherapy."
