<ABSTRACT>
A flexible connector (60) for connecting a movable contact (52) of an electrical 
switch (24) to a fixed electrical terminal (64). The flexible connector is a stack of 

flexible sheets (84) of conducting material. The flexible connector is such that it can 
accommodate the movement of the movable contact. A circuit interrupter system, 

such as a vacuum circuit interrupter (24), and metal clad switchgear (20) also includes 
the arrangement provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a flexible connector for a circuit interrupter and more 
particularly to a flexible connector having a stack of flexible sheets of a conducting 
material for connection with the movable contact of a circuit interrupter. Circuit breakers are useful for controlling and protecting electrical systems, 
apparatus and networks. A particular type of circuit breaker is a vacuum circuit 
interrupter apparatus which includes separable main contacts disposed in an insulated 
housing. Generally, one of the contacts is fixed relative to both the housing and to an 
external electrical conductor which is interconnected with the circuit interrupter. The 
other main contact is movable and usually comprises a cylindrical stem having the 
contact at one end thereof enclosed in a vacuum chamber and driving mechanism at 
the other end thereof external to the vacuum chamber. Often the electrical interconnecting between the circuit to be protected by the 
circuit interrupter and the movable contact is made on the cylindrical stem. 
Therefore, a need arises for channeling significant amounts of electrical current from 
a movable stem to a stationary electrical contact. There have been several suggested 
prior art devices for transferring current from a movable contact to a fixed terminal. 
For example, United Sates Patent Nos. 4,376,235 and 4,384,179 disclose a stiff 
flexible connector for a circuit breaker apparatus. A plurality of unitary, stiff, but 
flexible electrically conducting members are provided. The members are disposed in 
a horizontal position, but can move vertically due to a pleat in the member. Although 
the above design id in commercial use, it is sometimes not suitable for certain 
applications where reduced dimensional tolerances for the metal clad switchgear in 
which the interrupter are present, such a metal clad switchgear used in countries 
outside of the United States. Thus, it would be advantageous to provide a flexible, 
but stiff conducting member that can be used with a vacuum circuit interrupter and 
which provides other advantages over existing prior art designs.  In accordance with the invention, a flexible connector for connecting a movable 
contact of an electrical switch to a fixed electrical terminal is provided. The flexible 
connector is a stack of flexible sheets of a conducting material. The flexible onnector 
is constructed such that it can accommodate the movement of the movable contact. A circuit interrupter system, such as a vacuum circuit interrupter, is

A circuit interrupter system having a circuit interrupter (24) 
including a fixed contact (46), a movable contact (52) and a fixed electrical terminal 

(64) comprising a flexible connector (60) for connecting said movable contact (52) to 
said fixed electrical terminal (64), said flexible connector characterized by a stack of 

flexible sheets (84) of a conducting material which accommodates the movement of 
said movable contact. 
The flexible connector of Claim 1, wherein said stack is 
joined together by a joining arrangement at spaced apart zones (156, 158) near edges 

of said stack, whereby said flexible sheets stay together while maintaining the 
flexibility of said stack. 
The flexible connector of Claim 2, wherein said joining 
arrangement is joined by a plurality of spot welds (156, 158).

connector has a generally C-shape. 
The flexible connector of Claim 1, wherein said flexible 
connector has a first end portion (176), a second end portion (178) and an 

intermediate portion (179) between said first and second end portions, said first and 
second end portions being connected to said fixed electrical terminal (64) and said 

movable contact (52) being secured to said intermediate portion. 
The flexible connector of Claim 1, wherein said conducting 
material comprises copper. 
The flexible connector of Claim 1, wherein said flexible 
sheets (84) define aligned movable contact openings (141) of approximately the same 

cross-sectional shape as a portion of said movable contact
