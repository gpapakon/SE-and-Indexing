<ABSTRACT>
A chuck (10) consists of a head sleeve (12) which is screwed onto a projecting collar (52) of a shank (14). All built-in parts necessary for the chucking function of the chuck (10), such as insert (16), sliding member (18), rotary body (22), sliding ring (30) and thrust ring (28) as well as the bevel drive gear (40), are fitted in the head sleeve (12). This built-in group is secured in the head sleeve (12) by means of a snap ring (34). The head sleeve (12) with the entire assembly group forms a unit which can be combined with any shank types to form a chuck, the shanks merely requiring to have a threaded collar.

A chuck unit comprising a head socket (12) detachably screwed 
onto a shaft (14) insertable into a machine spindle of a numerically 

controlled machine tool and, together with the shaft (14), forming 
a chuck, in which the following components (16, 18, 20, 22, 28, 30, 

40) are provided: a displaceably mounted slide member (18), a 
plurality of radially movable clamping jaws (20) arranged at the 

front end of the slide member (18) and slidably guided on an inner 
conical surface of the head socket (12) or a head socket insert 

(16), a non-slidable, rotatably mounted, rotary member (22) 
screwed to the slide member (18) and provided with toothing, and 

an externally accessible drive pinion (40) rotatably mounted in the 
chuck casing and in driving engagement with the toothing of the 

rotary member (22), the rear end of which is formed so as to be 
supported by the shaft (14), optionally with the interposition of a 

thrust ring (28), characterised in that the clamping jaws (20), the 
slide member (18), the rotary member (22) and the drive pinion 

(40) are arranged and mounted inside the head socket (12), and 
the head socket (12) with its components (16-22, 28, 30, 40) is a 

preassembled structural unit forming the chuck after the head 
socket (12) has been screwed onto the shaft (14). 
A chuck unit according to claim 1, characterised in that the head 
socket (12) projects beyond all the components (16-22, 28, 30, 40)  

 
at the shaft end and carries the screw thread on the projecting 

end. 
A chuck unit according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the 
rotary member (22) has an outer flange (26), the face of which on 

the shaft side is rotationally axially supported on a thrust ring (28), 
optionally with the interposition of a slide ring (30), the thrust ring 

(28) for its part being axially non-displaceable in the head socket 
(12) or, at most, displaceable with difficulty. 
A chuck unit according to claim 3, characterised in that a shaft-end 
collar (24) of the rotary member (22) is rotatably mounted in 

the thrust ring (28). 
A chuck unit according to claim 3 or 4, characterised in that the 
head socket insert (16), having radial guide slots for the clamping 

jaws (20) at the clamping-jaws end, is axially supported at the shaft 
end on the thrust ring (28), the face of which on the shaft side 

forms a contact surface with the shaft (14) of the chuck (10). 
A chuck unit in particular according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the drive pinion (40) is a bevel gear with a 

radial axis and has a collar (60, 62) at both ends and is rotatably 
mounted and axially supported in a threaded ring (72) by means 

of its outer collar (60) to form an annular shoulder, the threaded 
ring (72) being fitted in a radial bore (36) of the head socket (12), 

and is rotatably mounted by means of its inner collar (62) in a first 
bore portion (66) of the head socket insert (16) and is axially 

supported on the said insert (16) by means of an annular shoulder,  
 

and in that the toothing portion (64), arranged between the two 
collars (60, 62), is accommodated with radial clearance in a 

second bore portion (68) of the insert (16), both bore portions (66, 
68) being partially circumferentially closed and the second bore 

portion (68) having a larger diameter than the first bore portion 
(66). 
A chuck unit according to claim 6, characterised in that the head 
socket insert (16) has a third, fully circumferentially closed bore 

portion (70) arranged co-axially with the two partially 
circumferentially closed bore portions (66, 68) and having a larger 

diameter than either of the two other bore portions (66, 68) and 
ending in the bore (36) of the head socket (12), and in that the 

threaded ring (72) engages in the third bore portion (70) and 
connects the head socket insert (16) to the head socket (12) in a 

torsion-resistant manner. 
A chuck unit according to claim 7, characterised in that the third 
bore portion (70) of the head socket insert (16) has an annular 

shoulder forming an axial stop surface for the threaded ring (72). 
A chuck unit according to one or more of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the head socket (12) is formed in one piece. 
A chuck comprising a chuck unit according to one or more of 
claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the chuck unit is detachably 

connected to a shaft insertable into a machine spindle and in that 
the junction forms the boundary between the chuck and the 

machine spindle.
