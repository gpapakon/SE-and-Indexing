<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an integrated
optical device, and more particularly to a hybrid integrated
optical device having optical fibers, optical waveguides, and
optical semiconductor devices respectively integrated on a
single substrate.A conventional integrated optical device will be
described with reference to Figs.9 to 13.Fig.9 is a perspective view of a conventional
optical IC disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-open Publication
No.57-84189. Semiconductor laser guides (recesses) 58 are
formed on a substrate 51, and semiconductor lasers 57 are
fitted in the semiconductor laser guides 58 and fixed thereto.Laser beams emitted from the three semiconductor
lasers are converged by a cylindrical lens 54 aligned in a
lens guide groove 55 formed on the substrate 51, and guided to
three light incident planes of an optical waveguide formed on
the substrate 51. The optical waveguide 52 guide the three
beams incident to the three light incident planes separately
at first, and then multiplex or join them at the junction
region thereof to output the laser beam from a single output 
plane thereof.Along the optical axis of the outputted laser beam,
a V groove 56 for guiding an optical fiber 53 is formed on the
substrate 51, starting from the position corresponding to the
light output plane to one end of the substrate 51. The
optical fiber 53 is fitted in, and fixed to, the V groove 56.The positions of the semiconductor lasers 57 and
optical fiber 53 are therefore aligned by the semiconductor
laser guides 58 and V groove 56 to provide optical coupling
therebetween.Figs.10A to 10F illustrate two different procedures
of forming the optical fiber guiding V groove (hereinafter
simply called a V groove) and the optical waveguide of the
integrated optical device shown in Fig.9. In the procedure
illustrated in Figs.10A to 10C, an optical waveguide is formed
after a V groove has been formed.As shown in Fig.10A, an SiO2 film 62 is formed on
the surface of a silicon substrate 61 having the (1 0 0)
plane, and an opening 63 to be used for V groove etching is
formed in the SiO2 film 62 by photolithography. By using the
SiO2 film 62 as a mask, a V groove 64 is formed by anisotropic
etching by using potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution,
as shown in Fig.10A.As shown in Fig.10B, a lower cladding layer 65 is
formed on the whole surface of the SiO2 film. Next, an core
region 66 having a relatively high refractive index is formed 
on the lower cladding layer 65 and patterned. An upper
cladding layer 67 is then formed on the
