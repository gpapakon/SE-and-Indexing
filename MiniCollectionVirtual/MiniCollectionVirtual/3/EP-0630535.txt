A PLL circuit modulatable by a modulation signal having 
a direct current component, comprising 


a voltage-controlled main oscillator (VCO1) which is 
adapted to have supplied thereto on its input side a 

control signal derived from the modulation signal as 
well as an error signal and which supplies on its output 

side an angle-modulated output signal of the PLL 
circuit, 
a loop divider (ST) which is connected downstream of 
said main oscillator (VCO1) and which has a loop-divider 

factor (N
S
), 
a phase comparator (PD) whose inputs are adapted to 
have supplied thereto the output of the loop divider 

(ST) and a reference frequency signal derived from the 
modulation signal, 
a loop filter (SF) which is connected downstream of 
the phase comparator (PD) and which supplies the error 

signal, 
a voltage-controlled reference oscillator (VC02), and 
a reference divider (RT) with a reference divider 
factor (N
E
), which is connected downstream of the 

reference oscillator (VC02) and which supplies the 
reference frequency signal for the phase comparator 

(PD), 
 
characterized by  

 

a first compensation filter (F1) whose input side is 
adapted to have supplied thereto the modulation signal 

and whose output side is connected to the control input 
of the reference oscillator (VC02), the transfer 

function (F
X1
(s)) of said first compensation filter 
(F1) being proportional to the reference divider factor 

(N
E
) and inversely proportional to the loop-divider 
factor (N
S
) and the tuning slope (K
E
) of the reference 
oscillator (VC02), and 
a second compensation filter (F2) whose input side is 
adapted to have supplied thereto the modulation signal 

and whose output side supplies the control signal, the 
transfer function (F
X2
(s)) of said second compensation 
filter (F2) being inversely proportional to the tuning 

slope (K
O
) of said main oscillator (VC01). 
A PLL circuit according to claim 1, characterized by
 
   - a data lowpass (DTP) connected downstream of said second 

compensation filter (F2). 
A PLL circuit according to claim 1 or 2, characterized 
by
 
   - an adder (ADD) whose input side is adapted to have 

supplied thereto the control signal and the error 
signal and whose output side is connected to the 

control input of the main oscillator (VC01). 
A PLL circuit according to one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in
 
   - that the transfer function (F
X1
(s)) of the first compensation 
filter (F1) is, in addition, proportional to 

the frequency shift (delta F) of the reference oscillator  
 

(VCO2). 
A PLL circuit according to one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in
 
   - that the transfer function (F
X2
(s)) of the second compensation 
filter (F2) is, in addition, proportional to 

the frequency shift (delta F) of the main oscillator 
(VCO1).
