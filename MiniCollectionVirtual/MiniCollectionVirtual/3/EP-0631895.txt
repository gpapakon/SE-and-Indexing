<ABSTRACT>
A change gear device (11) is disclosed of the type including a pair of 
substantially identical countershafts (27,29). The device includes a hydraulic 

PTO comprising a pair of fluid displacement mechanisms (71,73), each of which 
comprises a gerotor pump, and each of which receives input torque from one of 

the countershafts, by means of a pair of PTO input shafts (61,63), respectively. 
The PTO input shafts are clutched to the respective countershafts. The 

pressurized fluid output of the two fluid displacement mechanisms (71,73) is 
combined at a port (133), or other suitable location. Preferably, the two 

displacement mechanisms (71,73) are substantially identical, such that equal 
torques are transmitted through the transmission countershafts (27,29) while the 

hydraulic PTO of the invention is in operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transmissions of the multiple, substantially 
identical countershaft type, wherein means are provided for ensuring an even 
distribution of torque on all of said countershafts. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to such a transmission of the type having power take-off 
capability. Although the present invention may be utilized in various types of change 
gear transmissions, it is especially suited for use in twin countershaft 
transmissions designed primarily for heavy-duty truck applications, and will be 
described in connection therewith. Twin countershaft transmissions of the type 
to which the present invention relates are illustrated and described in detail in 
U.S. Patent No. 3,105,395, assigned to the assignee of the present invention 
and comprising the features defined in the first part of claim 1. The use of at least two substantially identical countershafts has a number of 
advantages which have been recognized by those skilled in the art at least since 
the issuance of the above-incorporated patent. The primary objective of a twin 
countershaft transmission is to ensure that the multiple countershafts each carry 
an equal share of the total torque being transmitted from the input shaft of the 
transmission to the output. If the torques are not substantially evenly divided 
between the countershafts, the true purpose of providing multiple countershafts 
is not achieved. In various vehicle applications for transmissions of the type to which this 
invention relates, it is desirable to be able to direct all or a portion of the output 
power from the vehicle engine, through the transmission, to an auxiliary device. 
As is well known to those skilled in the art, an arrangement for taking off power 
from a transmission for an auxiliary device is typically referred to as a "PTO" 
(Power Take-Off). An example of such a vehicle application requiring a PTO  
 
would be a truck in which the trailer is equipped with a "moving floor" to 
facilitate loading or unloading of the contents of the trailer. Other examples 
would include a cement mixer, in which the drum must be rotatably driven, or the 
pumper on a fire truck, wherein the PTO drives the water pump. In a typical, prior art PTO arrangement for twin countershaft transmissions, 
one or both of the countershafts is provided with a PTO gear, and an adjacent 
portion of the housing defines a window. An auxiliary device may be mounted to 
the transmission housing, at the window, with the device including a
