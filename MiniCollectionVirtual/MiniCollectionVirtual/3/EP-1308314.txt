<ABSTRACT>
A compact and light weight axle unit with good durability and reliability
for driving a vehicle wheel is provided wherein the splined bore 28 of the hub

6a is engaged with the splined shaft 30 of the drive shaft member 29, and a
stop ring 35 is held between the outer engagement groove 25 on the inner

peripheral surface of the splined bore 28 and the inner engagement groove 24
on the outer peripheral surface of the splined shaft 30 to prevent the splined

shaft 30 from being removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an axle unit for driving a vehicle wheel
as described in the preamble of claim 1.Various kinds of axle units have heretofore been used, in which an outer
ring and an inner ring are rotatably combined via rolling members in order to
rotatably support a wheel on a suspension unit. It is necessary for the axle unit
used for supporting the driven wheel on the independent suspension and
rotatably driving the driven wheel, to smoothly transmit the rotation of the
drive shaft to the wheel (while ensuring constant velocity); in combination 
with a constant velocity joint, regardless of relative displacement between the
differential gear and the driven wheel and the steering angle imparted to the
wheel. The axle unit for driving the vehicle wheel, which is a so-called fourth
generation hub unit, can be combined with such a constant velocity joint and
can be constructed relatively compact and lightweight. Such an axle unit has
heretofore been disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication Tokukai Hei No. 7-317754,
in US Patent No. 5,674,011, or in US 4 881 842, which comprises the
features mentionned in the preamble of claim 1.FIG. 36 shows one example of a conventional construction disclosed in
Japanese Patent Publication Tokukai Hei No. 7-317754. An outer ring 1
which does not rotate while being supported on the suspension unit when
incorporated into the vehicle, has an outward flange shaped attachment portion
2 for supporting the outer ring on the suspension unit, on the outer peripheral
face thereof, and two rows of outer ring raceways 3 on the inner peripheral
face thereof.On the radially inner side of the outer ring 1, a hub 6 formed by
combining a first element 4 and a second element 5 is disposed. Of these, the
first element 4 is formed in a cylindrical form having an mount flange 7 for
supporting the wheel on one end side (on the left end side in FIG. 36), and an
inner ring raceway 8 on the other end side (on the right end side in FIG. 36).
The second element 5 has on one end side (the left end side in FIG. 36) a
cylindrical portion 9 for externally securing the first element 4, and on the
other end side (the right end side in FIG. 36) a housing 11 which is the outer 
ring of a constant velocity joint 10 of a Rzeppa type, with the inner ring
raceway 8 arranged on the outer peripheral face of the middle part thereof.By disposing a plurality of rolling members 12, respectively between the
outer ring raceways 3 and the inner ring raceways 8, the hub 6 is rotatably
supported on the

<CLAIMS>
An axle unit for driving a vehicle wheel combined
with a constant velocity joint and comprising:


an outer ring (1) being stationary during use and having
an inner peripheral surface formed with an outer ring

raceway (3),
a hub (6a) having an outer peripheral surface formed with
a mount flange (7a) for wheel support on one end side thereof,

with an inner ring raceway (8) on the other end side thereof,
directly thereon or on an inner ring thereon, and with a

splined bore (28) at a center portion thereof,
a drive shaft member (29) provided with a splined shaft (30)
on one end side thereof to form a splined engagement

portion between the splined shaft (30) and the splined bore (28)
and with a housing portion (11) on the other end side thereof,

the housing portion (11) forming an outer ring of the constant
velocity joint, a plurality

of rolling members (12) rotatably provided
between the outer ring raceway (3) and the inner ring

raceway (8), 
characterized in that
 the axle unit further comprises:

the splined shaft (30)
having an end face portion formed

with a hole (135), on the inner peripheral surface of which an
outer engagement portion (136) is generally circumferentially

formed,
a coupling shaft member (137) being different from the hub (6a)

and having an outer peripheral surface (138) formed with an
inner engagement portion (140) generally circumferentially at a 

location in alignment with the outer engagement portion (136),
a stop ring (35) made of a resilient member and held
generally between the outer engagement portion and the

inner engagement portion for positioning the hub (6a) in the
axial direction with reference to the coupling shaft

member (137) and drive shaft member (29) in the state where part of
the hub (6a) is held in the axial direction from both sides

between part of the coupling shaft member (137) and part of the
drive shaft member (29), and
a seal member (42) made of a resilient material and
resiliently held between the hub (6a) and the drive shaft

member (29) to seal the splined engagement portion between the
splined bore (28) and the splined shaft (30).
The axle unit for driving the vehicle wheel of Claim
1, wherein the splined engagement portion is provided

with lubricant.
