<ABSTRACT>
Device for the axial clamping/release of chocks (15) of 
working rolls (14) on a rolling mill stand, the rolling mill 

stand including an actuation side (10a-Fig.1) and a working 
side (10b-Fig.2), stationary housings (11) associated with 

stationary blocks (12) being comprised at the sides, each of 
the stationary blocks (12) being associated with a relative 

sliding block (13) positioned in a direction axial to the 
working rolls (14), each sliding block (13) defining a 

lodgement for a chock (15), the bearings of the working 
rolls (14) being lubricated with a centralised air-oil 

system which comprises a first part of connectors (22) 
located on the machine and fixed to supporting means (24) 

and a second part of connectors (17) included on the front 
of the relative chock (15), the sliding blocks (13) being 

associated, on the actuation side (10a), with oscillatory 
means (27) that clamp/release the sliding blocks (13) 

to/from the relative chocks (15), these oscillatory 
clamping/ releasing means (27) being able to move from a 

second position of releasing (Fig.4) the chock (15) from the 
relative sliding block (13) to a first clamping position 

(Fig.3), these clamping/releasing means (27) in their second 
releasing position acting on the means (24) that support the 

first part of the connectors (22) so as to clamp 
transversely the first part of the connectors (22) in a 

determined position coordinated axially with the position of 
the second part of the connectors (17).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns a device for the axial
clamping/release of the chocks of the rolls in a rolling
mill stand, as set forth in the main claim.To be more exact, the subject of this invention is
embodied with a device which makes possible the quick and
easy clamping and release, both on the working side and on
the actuation side of the rolling mill stand, of the chocks
bearing the working rolls to and from the relative sliding
blocks providing axial displacement.Moreover the device according to the invention makes
possible a quick, easy and accurate connection and
disconnection of the connectors feeding lubrication fluid to
the bearings of the working rolls during the steps of
changing the rolls.The invention is applied advantageously, but not only, to
rolling mill stands which process wide flat products and
which require not only the normal reciprocal vertical
positioning of the rolls but also a reciprocal axial
displacement of the rolls so as to prevent hollows
developing at given points in the circumference of the rolls
owing to continuous wear.Rolling mill stands have been disclosed which have their
working rolls installed on chocks, which during working are
secured axially to sliding blocks positioned between the
chocks themselves and the stationary housings of the rolling
mill stands.Stationary blocks arranged axially to the rolls are
generally included between the sliding blocks and the
housings of the rolling mill stands.Displacement means act on the sliding blocks and enable 
the working rolls to be displaced axially during the working
steps.The state of the art discloses various examples of
systems of installation of the rolls on the relative chocks
and of the chocks on the relative sliding blocks both on the
actuation side and on the working side of the rolling mill
stand, these systems ensuring a correct positioning of the
rolls and the ability to obtain an accurate axial movement
thereof.JP-A-61-37307 discloses, for instance, a rolling mill
stand in which the working rolls are associated with axial
displacement means and in which an auxiliary thrust device
is included which enables all the plays to be eliminated
which are caused between the elements in reciprocal
movement. This auxiliary device acts on the relative
sliding block so as to ensure in an extremely accurate
manner and under all operational conditions the correct
desired axial displacement of the working rolls, thus
obviating inaccuracies due to such plays.SU-A-1.667.969 and SU-A-1.502.146 disclose a system for
axial clamping
