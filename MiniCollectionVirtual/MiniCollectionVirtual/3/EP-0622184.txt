<ABSTRACT>
A laminate which is useful as a construction 
material is disclosed. The laminate has a substrate 

layer which contains vinyl chloride polymer, a 
butadiene rubber graft copolymer, and has a 

superstrate layer which contains vinyl chloride 
polymer, butylacrylate rubber graft copolymer, and 

titanium dioxide. The superstrate layer protects the 
substrate layer from excessive exposure to 

ultraviolet light, heat and moisture, and thereby 
protects the substrate layer from weathering during 

outdoor use of the laminate as a material for siding, 
gutter systems, downspouts, shutters, window casings, 

and other exterior outdoor weather exposed building 
material applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coextruded 
multilayer laminate which is useful as an outdoor 
construction material, and more particularly relates 
to coextruded multilayer laminates which have a 
protective vinyl chloride polymer superstrate layer 
and a protected vinyl chloride polymer substrate 
layer. The use of vinyl chloride polymers as resin 
compositions for forming construction materials for 
external use, for example, residential siding, is 
known, see Canadian Patent No. 996,329 and McDonagh, 
U.S. Patent 4,169,180, issued September 25, 1979, 
which is incorporated herein by reference. Such 
materials have typically required impact 
modification, and typically butylacrylate rubber 
based graft copolymers, such as 2-propenoic acid 2-methyl 
methylester polymer with less than 10% 1,3 
butadiene and butyl 2-propenoate polymer or methyl 
methacrylate butylacrylate polymer graft polymers, 
have been used to impact modify these vinyl chloride 
polymer compositions due to the inherent 
weatherability of butylacrylate rubbers. Butadiene 
type graft copolymers, such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene 
graft copolymers have not typically 
been utilized to impact modify such vinyl chloride 
polymeric compositions, due to the historically 
perceived weatherability problems of such materials  
 
for external siding applications. Note the teachings 
of the McDonagh patent, U.S. 4,169,180, issued 
September 25, 1979, which on column 1, line 65 to 
column 2, line 5, sets out that resins such as 
acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene, methylmethacrylate-butadiene-styrene, 
and high impact polystyrene have 
the necessary strength to be used as outdoor 
construction materials, but which nevertheless 
undergo deterioration in their mechanical properties 
or discoloration when used outdoors and subjected to 
ultraviolet light and environmental degradation. The use of butylacrylate rubber graft polymers 
as impact modifiers for vinyl chloride polymeric 
compositions requiring resistance to the weathering 
elements of heat, ultraviolet light, and moisture, 
have, however, had several problems, including 
relatively low impact strength compared to similar 
rubber loadings of butadiene based graft polymers, 
and have typically caused the vinyl chloride polymer 
compositions to fuse too slowly resulting in the 
vinyl chloride polymers not obtaining their desired 
level of natural ductility due to failure to knit 
well, thereby requiring processing aids and higher 
processing temperatures and limiting output rates.
