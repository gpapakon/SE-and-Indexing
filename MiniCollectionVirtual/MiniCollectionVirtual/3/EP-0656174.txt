<ABSTRACT>
Baking and roasting oven with an electrically heated cooking chamber (2) and a heated steam generator (6) for the cooking chamber (2), and with a hot-air blower (4) and with a vapour flue (8) going off from the cooking chamber (2), and a device for controlling the cooking sequence which can be set via a programme selector (12). In the region of the cooking chamber, there is arranged a measuring device, designed as a humidity sensor (9)' or the like, for registering the cooking chamber steam concentration, said measuring device being a component of a measured value evaluation unit (10), by means of which signals for a unit (11) which controls the operation of the steam generator (6) are derived as a function of the measured values registered by the humidity sensor (9).
