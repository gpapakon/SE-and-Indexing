<ABSTRACT>
A bolus tip (100) for a multi-lumen catheter (10) for simultaneous injection and withdrawal of fluids to and from a patient. The bolus tip (100), preferably made of silicone or polyurethane, has a rounded elongate body consisting of an interfacing section (105) and a nose section (140). The interfacing section (105) includes two separate channels (112, 122) for fluid flow. The first and second channels (112, 122) run parallel to one another and are separated by a dividing section (130). The first channel (112) opens to a first bolus U-shaped cavity (114) located between the interfacing section (105) and nose section (140). The second channel (122) can extend either through the nose section (140) or terminates at a second bolus cavity (224) located longitudinally between the first bolus cavity (114) and the tip (142) of the nose section (140) on a side directly opposite the first bolus cavity (114).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to medical devices, and more particularly to multi-lumen catheters.Multi-lumen catheters are used for a variety of applications when it is necessary to have two separate fluid pathways. One such application for a multi-lumen catheter is for use in a hemodialysis process. During hemodialysis, a dual-lumen catheter can be employed to simultaneously accommodate opposing blood flow. More specifically, one lumen carries blood from a patient to a dialysis machine where it is processed for the removal of toxins, while the opposing lumen returns the purified blood to the patient.Multi-lumen catheters are well known in the art. An example of such a catheter which is used for hemodialysis is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,808,155 to Marhurkar. Marhurkar discloses a double lumen catheter including a return lumen and an inlet lumen. The return lumen extends along the entire length of the catheter to an opening at the distal end of the catheter. The inlet lumen is shorter than the return lumen and terminates at an opening substantially displaced from the return opening. The separation of the two openings is designed to prevent the mixing of treated blood with non-treated blood. Problems resulted from this design, however. First, the openings may become partially or totally occluded by the vessel wall or by a build up of blood components. Additionally, due to the pressure of fluid exiting the return lumen, a whipping action can occur, wherein the sharp edges of the tip of the catheter lashes back and forth within the vein of a patient, causing trauma to the inside wall of the vein. Moreover, this whipping action can cause clots to form around the outside surface of the catheter, obstructing blood flow to and from the openings.To overcome the problems of the Marhurkar device, Cruz et al. (U.S. Patent No. 5,571,093) disclosed a multi-lumen catheter with a bolus tip containing a radial passage which forms a port through the side of the bolus. In one embodiment, a first and second lumen are in fluid communication with the port. In another embodiment, the bolus tip contains two ports in the same side, one port providing an opening for the first lumen while the other port provides an opening for the second lumen. In both embodiments, the port nearest to the distal end of the bolus tip is created by removing a piece of the body around greater than 180Â° of the circumference of the body. According to Cruz et al., this configuration causes the fluid passing over the bolus to be slowed down,

<CLAIMS>
A bolus tip (200, 300) configured for connection to a distal end of a catheter body (10) comprising:

an elongate body, having a substantially cylindrical shape;
an interfacing section (205, 305) at a proximal end of said elongate body, comprising a first channel (212, 312, 412), a dividing section (230, 330, 430), and a second channel (222, 322, 422), wherein said dividing section separates said first channel from said second channel;
a nose section (240, 340) at a distal end of said elongate body, comprising a tip (242, 300) having a semi-spheroidal shape;
a first opening formed in said elongate body in fluid communication with the distal end of said first channel, wherein said opening defines a first bolus cavity (214, 314) that extends to said dividing section; and
a second opening formed in said elongate body in fluid communication with the distal end of said second channel, wherein said second opening defines a second bolus cavity (224, 324) that extends to said dividing section and is formed in a side different from said first opening.
The bolus tip of Claim 1, wherein the longitudinal length of said second channel, measured from said proximal end to said distal end, is greater than the longitudinal length of said first channel, measured from said proximal end to said distal end.
The bolus tip of any preceding claim, wherein said dividing section defines a third channel (332) that extends through said tip of said nose section.
The bolus tip of any preceding claim, wherein the cross-section of said first channel and said second channel is D-shaped.
The bolus tip of any preceding claim, wherein a cross-section of said first channel and said second channel is trapezoidal-shaped.
The bolus tip of any preceding claim, wherein said second opening is formed in said tip of said nose section.
A multi-lumen catheter apparatus for use in the simultaneous injection of fluids to, and aspiration of fluids from, a targeted area of a patient, comprising a catheter body (10) and a bolus tip (200, 300) according to any preceding claim, wherein said catheter body comprises an outer wall and a septum (16) that together form a first (12) and second (14) lumen, and wherein said bolus tip is separate from and connected to a distal end of said catheter body.
The multi-lumen catheter apparatus of Claim 7, wherein said septum defines a third lumen in fluid communication with said third channel recited in any of claims 3 to 8, and wherein said third channel extends through said tip of said nose section.
