<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to multi-layer substrates for 
flexible circuit boards and flexible circuit board assemblies 
and their methods of manufacture. More particularly this 
invention relates to a multi-layer flexible circuit board 
substrate for attaching components including chips and heat 
spreaders to form a three-dimensional circuit board assembly. All levels of packaging, (chip, electronic circuit assembly 
and systems are becoming more) miniturizated. A major 
technical challenge is thermal dissipation as power density 
increases. Typically heat spreaders or heat sinks are bonded 
to microelectronic components and chips, individually. 
Occasionally, a common heat sink may be bonded to multiple 
chips on co-planer top surfaces. In many applications, space 
limitations and cost do not allow the use of heat sinks or 
planer electronic assemblies. Flexible circuit boards offer advantages of light weight, 
thinness, three dimensional configuration, and flexibility. 
Space and height constraints for circuit packaging may dictate 
the use of flexible circuits over rigid laminates and very low 
profile chips and packages over high profile chip modules. US-A-3,781,596 discloses a single layer interconnection 
structure of metallic conductors on a polyimide film (e.g. 
KAPTONâ„¢ by E.I. DuPont de Nemours). US-A-3,868,724 discloses 
metallic conductors sandwiched between polyimide film which 
project through the film.  
 Rigid-Flex circuit boards are described in US-A-5,121,297 to 
Haas and US-A-5,144,742 to Lucas. In those patents single 
layer flex circuit boards are integrally connected between 
rigid circuit boards. In both patents multiple rigid circuit 
board layers are laminated to a flexible circuit board 
substrate and components are attached only onto the rigid 
circuit board sections. Connecting components directly to one side of a single-layer 
flexible circuit board is described by McBride, "Multi-function 
Plug for IC Package", IBM Technical Disclosure 
Bulletin Vol. 21, Feb. 1979, pp. 3594-3595. I/O terminals on 
the bottom of a chip are soldered to pads on top of a thin 
polyimide flexible decal. Also, a depression in a heat sink 
cover is bonded onto the top of the chip. Connecting lower 
power chips to a bottom side of a multi-layer flexible circuit 
board and high power chips to the top side of the flexible 
circuit board in order to connect the high power chips to the 
module cap is suggested by McBride, "Multilayer Flexible Film 
Module", IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin Vol. 26,
