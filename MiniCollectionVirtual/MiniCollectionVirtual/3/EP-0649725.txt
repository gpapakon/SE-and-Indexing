<ABSTRACT>
A low pressure thermoforming process is 
provided for forming fiber reinforced thermoplastic 

sheets into shaped articles. The sheets comprise 
chopped glass fibers having lengths of between 0.1 

and 1.0 inches and thermoplastic resin. The sheets 
are thermoformed by heating the sheets to a 

temperature above the glass transition temperature 
of the resin and the applying of pressure of 

between 10 psi and 25 psi to the heated sheet to 
form the sheet into the desired shaped article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to process for 
making fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites, 
and more particularly relates to a low pressure 
thermoforming process for making thermoplastic 
composites having reinforcing fibers. Aqueous methods of making fiber reinforced 
composite materials from an aqueous slurry of, 
solid polymer and reinforcing material are known. 
See Published European Patent Applications 
0,148,760 and 0,148,761, Wessling et al., U.S. 
Patent No. 4,426,470 issued January 17, 1984 and 
Gatward et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,716,449 issued 
February 13, 1973, all of which are incorporated 
herein by reference. In general these reinforced 
polymer composites have a uniform mixture of fiber, 
polymer and optionally binder and are prepared by 
performing dilute aqueous slurries of a solid heat-fusible 
organic polymer, a reinforcing material and 
optionally a latex binder. Reinforcing materials disclosed have included 
organic and inorganic products such as graphite, 
metal fibers, aromatic polyamides, cellulose and 
polyolefin fibers, and typically have included 
glass fibers such as chopped glass strands having a 
length of 1/8 to 1 inch (about 3.2 to 25.4 mm) or 
milled glass fibers which generally have a length  
 
of about 1/32 to 1/8 inch (about 0.79 to 3.2 mm). 
These reinforcing fibers have typically been formed 
into the final shaped composite article by 
injection molding or compression molding the 
composite under high pressures (for example on the 
order of 1000 psi and above) in order to cause the 
composite material to flow into the desired shape. Accordingly, there is a need for low pressure 
processes for the making of shaped articles from 
fiber reinforced composites. This invention provides a low pressure, for 
example, between 10 and 15 psi, process for making 
reinforced thermoplastic composites which comprises 
forming a dilute aqueous slurry of a solid, water-insoluble, 
heat-fusible organic polymer in 
particulate form and a chopped glass fiber 
reinforcing material, collecting the solids in the 
form of a continuous sheet or mat, dewatering, 
drying, heating and forming the sheet at an 
elevated temperature and low pressure. The process of this invention involves (1) an 
aqueous medium, preferably (2) a binder, usually at 
least partially in the form of a latex which 
contains either anionic or cationic bound charges, 
(3) a heat-fusible organic polymer which is in 
particulate form, (4) reinforcing fibers, and (5) 
optionally a flocculent. In the process, a
