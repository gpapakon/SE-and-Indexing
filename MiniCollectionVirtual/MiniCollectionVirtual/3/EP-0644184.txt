<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain azoxycyanobenzene 
derivatives, processes for their preparation, compositions 
containing such compounds and their use as fungicides. EP-A-0411716 discloses fungicidal compositions which comprise 
a carrier and, as active ingredient, a compound of the general 
formula 
R-N=NX 
or an N-oxide thereof, wherein R represents a substituted phenyl 
group, at least one substituent thereof being a group of general 
formula -NR1COR2 where R1 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl 
group, and R2 represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally 
substituted alkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, alkenyloxy, phenyl or phenoxy 
group; and X represents a cyano group, a group -COOH or a salt, 
ester or amido derivative thereof. However, in each of the 
examples, the substituted phenyl group R bears only one 
substituent, that being of formula -NR1COR2. It has now been discovered that certain azoxycyanobenzene 
derivatives, which bear at least two substituents on the benzene 
ring in addition to the azoxycyano group, exhibit good activity 
against certain phytopathogenic fungi. According to the present invention there is therefore provided 
a compound of the general formula 
 
 
in which R represents an optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, 
alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl or heterocylyl group; R1 
represents a halogen atom, nitro, cyano or optionally substituted 
alkyl, alkoxy, aryl or aryloxy group; and R2 represents a hydrogen 
or halogen atom, nitro, cyano or optionally substituted alkyl or 
alkoxy group. When the compounds of this invention contain an alkyl, alkenyl 
or alkynyl substituent group, this may be linear or branched and 
may contain up to 12, preferably up to 6 and especially up to 4, 
carbon atoms. Cycloalkyl or cycloalkenyl groups may contain 3 to 
8, preferably 3 to 6, carbon atoms. An aryl group may be any 
aromatic hydrocarbon group, especially a phenyl or naphthyl group. 
A heterocyclyl group may be any saturated or unsaturated ring 
system containing at least one heteroatom, 3- to 6-membered rings 
being preferred and 5- and 6-membered rings being especially 
preferred. Nitrogen-, oxygen- and sulphur-containing heterocyclic 
rings, such as pyridyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, furyl, pyranyl, 
morpholinyl and thienyl, are particualarly preferred. When any of the foregoing substituents are designated as being 
optionally substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally 
present may be any one or more of those customarily employed in the 
development of pesticidal
