<CLAIMS>
Feed device for the feeding of assembly parts, in particular 
nuts or other elements, to a feed channel of a 

processing device for the pressing in or attachment of 
assembly parts to components, comprising a nozzle (20) 

which has a nozzle channel (22) through it for the elements 
(M), and which can be connected to a guide piece 

(6) of the processing device (2) so that the nozzle 
channel (20) communicates at one end with the feed channel 

(8) provided in the guide piece (6), while the other 
end of the nozzle channel (22) is connected to a feed 

line (26), characterised in that two levers (40) are 
pivotally connected to opposing sides of the nozzle 

(20), are biased by springs (46) into a closed position 
for the coupling of the nozzle (20) to the guide piece 

(6) and can be pivoted manually into an open position to 
release the nozzle (20) from the guide piece (6), and in 

that the levers (40) engage in lateral grooves (54) of 
the guide piece (6) in the coupled state and their hook-like 

ends (50) embrace the guide piece (6). 
Feed device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the nozzle (20) has a protrusion (34) that can run into 

a correspondingly shaped receiving opening (36) of the 
guide piece (6) for the coupling of the feed device, so 

that the nozzle channel (22) extending through the protrusion 
(34) opens into the feed channel (8) at the side 

and the front surface (38) of the nozzle (20) adjoining 
the protrusion (34) contacts the guide piece (6).  

 
Feed device according to claim 1, characterised in that 
the hook-shaped ends (50) of the levers (40) are provided 

with inclined surfaces (52) at their confronting 
sides, these inclined surfaces making it easier to push 

the levers (40) onto the guide piece (6). 
Feed device in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that each of the levers (40) 

has two arms (40a, b), one of which serves as a retaining 
arm (40a) acting on the guide piece, and the other 

of which serves as actuator arm (40b). 
Feed device in accordance with claim 4, characterised in 
that the springs (46) act between the actuator arms 

(40b) and the nozzle (20) and, in the disconnected 
state, press the retaining arms (40a) with their associated 

projections (48) against contact surfaces on the 
nozzle (20). 
Feed device in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised in that the feed line (26) is located 

in a region (24) of expanded cross section of the 
nozzle channel (22) and is fixed therein. 
Feed device in accordance with claim 6, characterised in 
that the top side of the plate-like nozzle (20) is 

formed by a clamp plate (28) in the section (24) of the 
nozzle channel (22) of expanded cross section and the 

clamp plate (28) together with pins (32), fixes the feed 
line (26) in the nozzle (20). 
Feed device in accordance with claims 2 to 7, characterised 
in that a catch (56) under spring tension is provided 

in the protrusion (34) of the nozzle (20) and is 
pressed in the disconnected state by the spring bias  

 
into a position blocking the nozzle channel (22), and is 

pressed automatically into a release position in the 
coupled state. 
Feed device in accordance with one of the preceding 
claims, characterised by a locking mechanism (60) provided 

at the nozzle (20); said locking mechanism locking 
the levers (40) in their closed position when in their 

coupled state. 
Feed device in accordance with claim 9, characterised in 
that the locking mechanism (60) consists of a support 

(62) mounted to the nozzle (20) and a locking element 
(64) movably attached to the support (62), the locking 

element being held by spring force (68) in a locked position, 
which prevents pivoting of the levers (40) due 

to its contact with the two levers (40), and said locking 
element being manually movable into a release position. 
Feed device in accordance with claim 10, characterised 
in that an auxiliary tool (74) equipped with a ramp surface 

(78) is provided to unlock the locking mechanism 
(60) and has a recess (76) that can slide along the feed 

line (26) so that its ramp surface (78) co-operates with 
a corresponding ramp surface (72) of the locking element 

(64) to push the locking element (64) away. 
Feed device in accordance with claim 11, characterised 
in that the auxiliary tool (74) features two additional 

ramp surfaces (80) that pivot the two levers (40) into 
their open position when the auxiliary tool (74) is 

pushed along to unlock the locking mechanism (60).
