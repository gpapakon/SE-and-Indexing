<ABSTRACT>
A fastener assembly (20) having a hook (68) for 
connecting a first article (78) to a continuous cable (70) 

includes first and second matable members (22,24) each 
having a body portion (26) at a cable-proximate end 

thereof, the body portion (26) having a work arm (32) and a 
cable-proximate arm extending outwardly from a mating 

face (28) thereof and defining therebetween a recess (48) 
for receiving the body portion (26) of the other member 

when the members (22,24) are mated, and a hook portion (54). The 
work and cable-proximate arms (32,40) of the first member 

(22) are in opposite vertical orientation to the work and 
cable-proximate arms (32,40) of the second member (24). The 

members (22, 24) are secured together by engaging a cable 
engaging surface (42) of the cable-proximate arms (40) of 

each of the members (22,24) to opposite sides of a cable (70) and 
slidingly moving them together until latches (38) on the 

respective work arms (32) engage corresponding latching 
recesses (46) of the cable-proximate arms (40) and latching 

means (66) on the respective hook portions (54) engage each 
other.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to fasteners and more
particularly to fasteners for securing an article to a
cable.With the advent of commercially available
electrical power transmission, certain vehicles have
been devised utilizing electricity provided by cables
strung overhead along fixed routes. Such vehicles
include trolley cars and locomotives and incorporate
devices such as trolleys or pantographs engageable with
an exposed trolley contact wire or conductor suspended
from a catenary cable at a substantially constant height
above the ground path or rails upon which the vehicles
will travel. The surface of the electrified conductor
is continuously exposed along its length for such
engagement, and fastening the conductor for suspension
from the catenary cable must provide clearance for the
continuously exposed surface. Such conductors generally
are solid wire extrusions of high strength, low
resistance copper alloy having a generally cylindrical
cross section profiled to define a pair of grooves on
opposed sides of the top half of the conductor into
which appropriately shaped clamping surfaces of
conventional fasteners are received to achieve a griping
relationship to the conductor. Such conventional
fasteners also include a hook to which eyelets of hanger
cables can be attached. Corresponding fasteners can be
utilized to secure the hanger cables to the catenary
cable overhead but which can be clamped entirely around
the catenary cable. As the catenary cable assumes a
catenary curved vertical shape upon being suspended
between spaced supports, the hanger cables are of
different lengths appropriate to maintain the conductor
cable at a constant height when hung from the varying
height of the vertically curved catenary cable. One such conventional fastener comprises a pair of
halves secured together above the cable conductor by a
bolt and nut arrangement. A similar type fastener is
used to secure the hanger cable to the catenary cable.
The bolt and nut arrangements, however, gradually become
loosened owing to the environmental exposure,
dimensional changes owing to thermal expansion and other
factors including the vibration transmitted to the line
by the vehicles using the cable. Maintenance of the
line requires that each bolt and nut arrangement be
checked on a periodic basis to assure that the fastening
device is securely fastened to the cable. Such
fasteners furthermore require that the maintenance
persons have an inventory containing a number of
different parts such as for example nuts, bolts,

<CLAIMS>
A fastener assembly (20,120) for fastening a cable member
(70,84) to an article for electrical distribution, comprising a pair of

matable members (22,24) each having a body portion (26), a hook
portion (54), a cable engaging surface (42,142), a latching surface

(56) on said hook portion (54), and two parallel arms (32,40,132,142)
provided on said body portion and extending in the same direction as

the hook portion, the parallel arms (32,40,132,142) and the hook
portion (54) on the one of said matable members respectively engaging the parallel arms

(32,40,132,142) and the hook portion (54) on the other of said
matable members so that the cable engaging surfaces (42,142) on the

pair of matable members engage and secure the fastener assembly to
the cable member when the fastener assembly is positioned onto the

cable and the hook portions (54) are latched together defining a hook
to be secured to the article.
The fastener assembly of claim 1, wherein said hook portion (54)
includes a first section (56) extending away from said body portion

(26) and a second section (58) extending from said first section (56)
substantially parallel to said body portion (26,126).
The fastener assembly of claim 1 or 2, wherein said parallel arms
comprise a work arm (32,132) and a cable proximate arm (40,142),

the work and cable proximate arms (32,40,132,142) of one of the
matable members (22) being in opposite vertical orientation of the

work and cable proximate arms (32,40,132,142) of the other one of
the matable members (24), the cable engaging surface being disposed

on the cable proximate arm (40,142).
The fastener assembly of claim 2, wherein said second section
(58) has a camming surface (62) and a latching edge (64) for latching 

said matable members (22,24) together.
The fastener assembly of claim 3, wherein said cable engaging
surface (42) of said cable-proximate arm (40) is configured to be

received in grooves (72) on opposing sides of a top half of the cable
member (70) thereby achieving a gripping relationship to the cable

(70).
The fastener assembly of claim 3, wherein said cable-proximate
arms (140) of said matable members (22,24) are configured to be

clamped entirely around the cable member (84).
The fastener assembly of claim 3, wherein said work arm
(32,132) includes a lower tapered surface (34) and a latch (38) at a

leading end thereof.
The fastener assembly of claim 7, wherein said cable-proximate
arm (140) includes a tapered surface (44) along a top edge thereof

complementary to said lower tapered surface (34) of said work arm
(32,132) and includes a latching recess (46) adapted to receive said

latch (38) of the work arm 32,132).
The fastener assembly of any one of the preceding claims,
wherein said matable members are hermaphroditic.
