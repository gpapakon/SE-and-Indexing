<ABSTRACT>
In the field of hematopoietic stem cell isolation and implantation or engraftment, methods are disclosed for isolating cell populations that are highly enriched for human pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. The cells are CD34+, HLA-DR- and express the receptor for the c-kit ligand (KR+). Methods of growing the cells in long term bone marrow cultures in the presence of c-kit ligand and other cytokines are disclosed. The cells may be useful for transplantation and for use in gene therapy protocols.

 HOMAN STEM CELL COMPOSITIONS AND METHODSREFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/919,447 filed July 27, 1992, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.BACKGROUNDThe present invention relates to pluripotent hematopoietic stems cells (PHSC's) and to methods for their isolation and use. Evidence shows that PHSC's are responsible for the generation of all of the formed elements of blood, including for instance the myeloid, iymphoid, erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. However, despite this understanding and continued extensive efforts in industry and academia, PHSC's have not been identified and isolated in a pure form. The high level interest in purifying stem cells speaks to the utility that will be found with enriched stem cell compositions. For example, availability of pure or substantially pure stem cells will provide a means to identify factors which cause or prevent dedication to specific lineages. Pure or substantially pure stem cells may also be used in grafts or transplantations (including autotransplants, allogeneic transplants and others), for example to provide immediate and/or long term health benefits due to the presence and maintenance of the graft or transplant in the host, to provide chimeras, etc. For example, human ste cells may be isolated and used as stem cell grafts for in utero transplantation into human fetuses 

diagnosed with a genetic disorder which can be corrected by normal BM transplantation. The known similar methods utilize human fetal liver cells as grafts which in most all cases would be from unrelated mismatched donors and in most instances not available at will. Autotransplants of pure stem cells could be potentially useful in several leukemias where purified stem cells could be devoid of cancer cells and might therefore provide a disease-free graft.Enriched stem cell compositions also represent excellent targets for gene transfer studies and in gene therapy in which cells are genetically manipulated, e.g. by transfection and transduction. In this manner, propagation of a gene introduced or altered by the genetic manipulation in progeny cells can be assured by the cells' capacity for self-renewal. Stem cell compositions may also be used in treating and in research for treating neoplastic conditions such as leukemias, lymphomas, and others.Researchers in the area have employed various approaches to enrich for stem cells, which are highly rare and currently believed to represent
