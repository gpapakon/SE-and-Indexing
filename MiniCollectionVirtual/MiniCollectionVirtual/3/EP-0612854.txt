<ABSTRACT>
The iron oxide content of ilmenite or other titanium ore is reduction to metallic 
iron by reaction with coal in a rotary kiln 1. The resulting iron metal content of 

the thus treated ore is oxidised in aqueous solution in an aerator 3 through 
which an oxidising gas containing oxygen and/or ozone is passed. Resulting 

particles of iron oxide are separated from the ilmenite solution in cyclone 5 and 
then by leaching the solution in vessel 7 with acid, the resulting product being 

filtered in vessel 8.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the production of synthetic rutile by hydrometallurgical
processes and, in particular, to the production of synthetic rutile by the Becher
process.Titanium dioxide is, in its pure form, a valuable white pigment
used in paints. Traditionally, the pigment has been obtained using the
"chloride" or "sulphate" processing routes. The "sulphate" processing route,
which has fallen into disfavour in recent times due to the environmental
problems caused by the disposal of acidic ferrous sulphate liquors, involves the
pug-roasting of ilmenite with concentrated sulphuric acid to form a solid
sulphate cake which is then dissolved in hot dilute sulphuric acid to liberate iron.
Ferric ion is removed from the solution by reduction with scrap iron and the
ferrous ions are partially removed from the solution by crystallisation of hydrated
ferrous sulphate (copperas). Hydrous titanium dioxide is calcined and further
processed to produce the pigment.In order to overcome the environmental problems inherent in the "sulphate"
route, the "chloride" route has become commonplace. The "chloride" process
involves the chlorination of natural or synthetic rutile at high temperatures to
form a mixture of titanium tetrachloride and ferric chloride vapours which are
separated from each other by selective condensation and, if necessary, further
refining steps. The titanium tetrachloride is then oxidised to produce pigment
grade titanium dioxide or reduced to produce titanium metal in accordance with
the Kroll process.It is clear that in both the above processing routes the removal of iron is a
problem, which at the very least involves further capital costs to address. For 
example, ferric chloride may be oxidised in a costly further processing stage to
iron oxides and the chlorine recovered for further use in a chloride process.Moreover, as the world reserves of natural rutile, containing approximately 95%
by weight titanium dioxide fall, the iron removal problem becomes more acute.
Therefore, alternative processes have been devised for the environmentally
acceptable production of synthetic rutile from the abundant available reserves of
ilmenite, a mixed iron and titanium oxide ore, represented approximately by the
formula FeTiO3. Ilmenite contains about 53% by weight titanium dioxide.The majority of such processes include hydrometallurgical steps but generally
commence with partial or complete reduction of the iron oxides present within
the ilmenite to metallic iron by pyrometallurgical processing followed by
