<ABSTRACT>
A closure apparatus (60) for a container (50) includes an adapter (62) which is mounted on or otherwise integrally formed with the container adjacent the container opening (52), and a cap (64) which is movable between an opened position and a closed position over the container opening. A coupling mechanism comprised of slots (84, 86) and retention pins (106, 108) is provided for interconnecting the cap and the adapter so as to enable the cap to slide relative to the adapter between the opened and closed positions. A clamping mechanism, preferably provided by opposing ramped surfaces (80, 82, 102, 104) on the adapter and cap, is provided to cooperate with the coupling mechanism whereby the cap is urged into pressing engagement with the adapter over the container opening as the cap slides into the closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to closure
mechanisms for containers and more particularly to a
closure mechanism in which a cap is slidably coupled to
an adapter affixed to or integrally formed with the top
of the container, whereby the cap may be retained on
the container and clamped against the adapter in
response to sliding movement of the cap relative to the
adapter against opposing ramped surfaces.Various closure devices for containers have been
devised. For example, French Patent No. 917849
describes a cap mechanism and a separate pivotal
removal mechanism with a pin positioned in a slot to
attach the cap to the container. The cap moves
laterally until the pin is in a narrow part of the slot
at which point a flange is engaged under a lip of the
cap. As the device is pivoted, the cap is forced loose
after which it remains attached. The cap is then
moveable along the groove to a position adjacent to the
side of the bottle. However, this device does not
provide a clamping mechanism whereby coaction between
opposing ramped surfaces and the connecting mechanism
effects clamping between a cap and an adapter whereby
the slot and pin, in cooperation with ramped surfaces,
enable clamping as well as pivotal movement.Another pin and slot mechanism, but without a
clamping mechanism provided by opposing ramped
surfaces, is illustrated in US-A-2792144.Other closure devices have incorporated opposing
ramped surfaces such as the container closure structure
in US-A-2881942. However, this closure mechanism does
not incorporate a pin and slot mechanism whereby the
cap is retained on the container and facilitates the
clamping action between the opposing ramped surfaces.According to a first aspect of the present
invention, there is provided a closure device for
selectively closing an opening in a container, the 
closure device comprising:
an adapter located on the container so that the
opening of the container is within a central opening in
an upwardly-facing adapter closure surface of the
adapter; anda cap having a downwardly-facing cap closure
surface which is slidable transversely across the
adapter closure surface between an opened position in
which the cap is displaced from the central opening and
a closed position in which the cap closure surface
closes the central opening,the adapter having a first ramped
surface and the cap having a second ramped
surface, the first ramped surface sliding
relative to the second ramped surface when the
cap slides into the closed position,wherein one of the cap and the
