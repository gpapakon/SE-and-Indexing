<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for manufacturing a carbon fiber woven fabric by moving a warp sheet (11) formed of carbon 
fiber warps so as to open and close the same and placing wefts (2) on water injected from a nozzle (14) of a water-jet 

loom to be driven into the warp sheet (11) when the warp sheet is opened, wherein wefts (2) are driven while 
preventing injected water from being dispersed on a weft running path extending from a bobbin (1) around which a 

weft is wound to a needle entrance portion (15) of the nozzle (14) so as to prevent the nozzle from being clogged 
with fluffs produced from wefts and while preventing the movement of warps so as to prevent the production of fluffs 

and warp cutting, thereby making it possible to effect a high-speed continuous operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and an
apparatus for manufacturing a carbon fiber woven fabric
using a water-jet loom.Carbon fiber woven fabrics are broadly used as
intermediate base materials for molding carbon fiber
reinforced plastics (CFRP). CFRP is used for goods for
sports and leisure, materials for aircraft, etc. because
it is excellent in mechanical properties such as specific
strength and specific elastic modulus. However, the
reduction in cost of intermediate base materials such as
woven fabrics is an important subject, as well as the
reduction in cost of carbon fiber itself in order to
further enlarge the applications for CFRP.Because carbon fiber is fragile in addition to being
high in stiffness, it is not a fiber that is easy to
weave. Carbon fiber also has a small diameter of a single
fiber, that is, a small single fiber diameter, of 5 to 15
Âµ m as compared with that of a usual natural fiber or
synthetic fiber. In addition, for carbon fiber the
tensile elongation at break thereof is also small, in the
range of 1.5 to 2.5% and further the knot strength thereof
is low. Thus, generation of fluffs in a carbon fibre
weaving process is inevitable. Namely, it is a fiber hard
to be woven. In view of such points, for example, as
described in JP-A-SHO 63-315638, it is woven while paying
attention to generation of fluffs and yarn cutting, using
a shuttle loom or a rapier loom. In a shuttle loom or a
rapier loom, however, the driving speed of wefts is
suppressed to a low range of about 80 to 200 picks/min. 
by the weaving mechanism, and there is a problem that the
efficiency is poor.On the other hand, as a weaving machine capable of
performing high-speed weaving, a water-jet loom is known,
wherein a weft to be flown is placed on water injected
from a nozzle (water-jet flow) at high pressure. However,
when weaving using such a water-jet loom and using a
carbon fiber yarn as the weft, the process could be
performed with no trouble for a certain period of time,
but in due course, the nozzle became clogged with fluffs,
generated on the weft by scratching between the weft and
various guides, and flying of the weft was missed. Many
difficulties resulted that forced the machine to be
stopped.Furthermore, with respect to the warp, warps
comprising carbon fiber yarns are scratched violently with
healds and reed dents caused by the vertical motion of the
healds and the oscillating motion of the reed, and also
fluffs are generated. If fluffs are generated, this not
only reduces the quality of the woven
