<ABSTRACT>
The production of filter material of activated carbon compacts, by means of which a selective separation of organic and inorganic phases is possible, is carried out by the following steps:   (a) mixing activated carbon powder with polyvinyl alcohol powder in a ratio of from 9:1 to 3:1, (b) mixing the powder from step (a) with distilled water or a mixture of distilled water and ethyl alcohol (ethanol), (c) forming of tablets or similar structures in a mould under pressure and   (d) successive heating of the tablets at     1) from 40 to 80 DEG C for from 3 to 6 hours,   2) from 80 to 120 DEG C for from 10 to 14 hours.     A filter material according to the invention for the selective separation of organic material from an organic phase comprises activated carbon compacts produced in this way and is used for the selective separation of organic and inorganic phases.

<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of filter material from
activated carbon compacts which make possible the selective

separation of organic and inorganic phases, with the
following steps:


(a) mixing activated carbon powder with polyvinyl alcohol
powder in the ratio of 9:1 to 3:1,
(b) mixing the powder from step (a) with distilled water
or a mixture of distilled water and ethyl alcohol,
(c) shaping in a mould under pressure to form pellets or
similar structures, and
(d) successively heating the pellets to

1) 40 to 80°C for 3 to 6 hours,
2) 80 to 120°C for 10 to 14 hours.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised in that
a mixture of water and ethyl alcohol with a mass ratio of

10:0 to 10:2 is used in (b).
A process according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that the mixtures (a) and (b) are

used in a mass ratio of 1:1 to 1:2.
A process according to any one of the preceding
Claims, characterised in that step (c) is performed at a

pressure of 20 to 80 kg/cm
2
 and is maintained for 20 to 40
seconds at this pressure.
A filter material for the selective separation of
organic material from 
an inorganic phase, comprising
activated carbon compacts which can be produced by the

process according to any one of Claims 1 to 4.
