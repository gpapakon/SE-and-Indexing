<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a conveyor provided with a frame 
and with at least one carrier (8) guided by a guide means (1), 

which can be moved 
in the longitudinal direction of the conveyor by driving means. At least 

some of the carriers (8) support sliding pieces (11), which can be 
moved with 

respect to the carriers in question by control means, in a direction 
transversely to the intended direction of movement of the carriers (8) 

during 
operation, so as to move objects to be transported with the conveyor 

during 
operation. The carriers are guided by a single elongated guide 

means (1), 
whilst a sliding piece (11) is provided with a receptacle (14) which is 

open at its 
bottom side. The sliding piece is movable with respect to a carrier(s), 

between a first position, in which the receptacle (14) is closed by 
a closing 

means (10) connected to a carrier(s), and a second position, in 
which the 

receptacle (14) in the sliding piece (11) is located beside the closing 
means (10) and 

beside the guide means (1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a conveyor provided with a frame 
and with carriers guided by guide means, which can be moved in the 
longitudinal direction of the conveyor by driving means, whereby at least 
some of the carriers support sliding pieces, which can be moved with 
respect to the respective carriers by control means, in a direction 
transversely to the intended direction of movement of the carriers during 
operation, so as to move objects to be transported with the conveyor during 
operation. Conveyors of this kind are for example known from US-A-3,361,247, 
FR-A-2,388,737 and GB-A-2,057,381. These conveyors are intended to move objects which are 
supplied in one or more supply stations to destination stations, which 
generally comprise discharge means, such as conveyor belts, chutes or the 
like, which are disposed near one side of the conveyor. The objects are 
usually provided with codes, which are read and processed in an electronic 
control device, by means of which the sliding pieces are moved with respect 
to the carriers at desired points of time, in such a manner that each 
object is delivered from the conveyor to a desired destination station 
in the respective destination station. With these devices the objects to be transported are 
directly supported on the carriers and they are pushed off the carriers 
near a selected destination station by means of the sliding pieces, whereby 
the sliding pieces in question engage the sides of the objects. In 
particular with the high conveying velocities that are aimed at these known 
devices are generally not suitable for moving for example small, light 
objects, round objects and the like, since these objects usually move from 
the position relative to the carriers in which they were placed onto the 
conveyor while being moved by means of the conveyor, and consequently will 
not be pushed off the conveyor by the sliding pieces in the correct 
destination station. Furthermore a device for treating foodstuffs is known from 
NL-A-8802813, which device is provided with a conveyor belt built up of 
a plurality of plate-shaped parts, which are pivotally interconnected by 
means of pivot pins extending perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction 
of the conveyor belt.  
 Recesses for receiving foodstuffs to be treated are 
provided in said plate-shaped parts in side-by-side relationship. 
Furthermore slides are provided under said plate-shaped parts, which can 
be moved parallel to said pivot pins at desired places, between a position 
in which the

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor provided with a frame and with at least one 
carrier (8, 21) guided by a guide means (1; 21), which can be moved in 

the longitudinal direction of the conveyor by driving means, whereby at 
least some of the carriers (8, 21) support sliding pieces (11, 31), which 

can be moved with respect to the carriers in question (8, 21) by control 
means (15-17; 33-36), in a direction transversely to the intended direction 

of movement of the carriers (8, 21) during operation, so as to move objects 
to be transported with the conveyor during operation, characterized in 

that said carriers (8, 21) are guided by a single elongated guide means 
(1, 20), whilst a sliding piece (11, 31) is provided with a receptacle 

(14), which is open at its bottom side, and is movable with respect to 
said carrier(s) (8, 21), between a first position, in which the receptacle 

(14) is closed by a closing means (10, 27) connected to (one of) said 
carrier(s) (8, 21), and a second position, in which said receptacle (14) 

in the sliding piece (11, 31) is located beside the closing means (10, 
27) and beside the guide means (1, 20). 
A conveyor according to claim 1, characterized in that 
said sliding piece (11, 31) is movable from said first position to a second 

position in two opposite directions. 
A conveyor according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that a sliding piece (11) co-operates with an at least  

 
substantially T-shaped (seen in plan view) carrier (8), which is provided 

with a beam (9), along which a coupling piece (12) is movable, and with
