<ABSTRACT>
A method is provided for the treatment of symptoms of sepsis that are mediated by proteins that are substantially homologous to CD14 myelomonocytic antigen. A soluble form of CD14 ("sCD14") is produced by using molecular genetic techniques to express a nucleic acid sequence that encodes CD14. The soluble form of the CD14 thus produced is isolated and purified. The purified soluble CD14 is administered to mammals in order to prevent or treat the symptoms of sepsis.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A NOVEL THERAPY FOR TREATING SEPSISUSING A SOLUBLE FORMOF RECOMBINANT CD14 MYELOMONOCYTIC ANTIGEN FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to the developme of methods and therapies for effectively preventing or treating the symptoms of medical conditions such as sepsis and tissue rejection, and for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms that result in sepsis.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Sepsis is a life-threatening medical condition th can be brought on by infection or trauma. The symptoms of sepsis can include chills, profuse sweating, fever, weaknes or hypotension, followed by leukopenia, intravascular coagulation, shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and often, death. R. Ulevitch, et al . , J. Trauma 30: S189-92 (1990). The symptoms of sepsis can be induced by certain substances (elements, molecules, chemical compounds, or any mixture thereof) liberated during infection or trauma. Some pathogenic bacteria, viruses, and plants elaborate sepsis- inducing substances. The lipopolysaccharides ("LPS"; also, "endotoxins that are typically present on the outer membrane of all gra negative bacteria are among the most studied and best understood sepsis-inducing substances. While the precise chemical structures of LPS molecules obtained from differen bacteria may vary in a species-specific fashion, a region called the lipid A region is common to all LPS molecules. Rietschel et al., in Handbook of Endotoxins. 1: 187-214, ed R. Proctor and E. Rietschel, Elsevier, Amsterdam (1984) . Th lipid A region mediates many, if not all, of the LPS- dependent pathophysiologic changes that characterize sepsisLPS is believed to be a primary cause of death in humans afflicted with gram-negative sepsis, van Deventer et 

al . . Lancet, 1: 605 (1988); Ziegler et al., J. Infect. Pis.. 136: 19-28 (1987) . Treatment of patients suffering from sepsis and gram-negative bacteremia with a monoclonal antibody against LPS decreased their mortality rate. Ziegler et al., N. EnÏƒ. J. Med.. 324: 429 (1991). LPS and gram- negative bacteria may also play a role in the pathology of auto-immune conditions such as Reiter's syndrome, which is associated with rheumatoid arthritis.LPS causes polymorphonuclear leukocytes, endothelial cells, and cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage to rapidly elaborate and release a variety of cell products, among these immunoregulatory substances known as cytokines that are capable of initiating, modulating or mediating humoral and cellular immune responses and

CLAIMS
We claim:
1. A method for treating symptoms of septic shock in mammals, comprising administering a dose of recombinant CD14 that is effective to treat symptoms of sepsis.
2. A method according to claim 1 wherein said recombinant CD14 is administered by injection.
3. A method according to claim 1 wherein said CD14 is administered by intraperitoneal injection. 4. A method according to claim 1 wherein said CD14 is administered by intravenous injection.
5. A method according to claim 1 wherein said CD14 is administered at the time said mammal is exposed to agents responsible for septic shock. 6. A method according to claim 1 wherein said CD14 is administered at the time said mammal exhibits symptoms of septic shock.
7. A method according to claim 1 wherein said CD14 is administered before said mammal has developed symptoms of septic shock.
8. The method of claim 1 wherein the symptoms of sepsis are caused by gram negative bacteria.
9. The method of claim 1 wherein the symptoms of sepsis are caused by LPS. 10. A method for treating medical conditions that are mediated by the action of CD14, comprising administering a dose of recombinant CD14 that is effective to treat symptoms 


of medical conditions that are mediated by the action of CD14.
11. A method according to claim 10 where the medical condition is a member of the group that includes sepsis, gram negative bacteraemia, autoimmune disease and tissue rejection.
12. A method according to claim 10 where the protein is soluble human CD14.
13. A method according to claim 10 where the primary structure of the CD14 is identical to that of the human CD14 molecule, but where the pattern of glycosylation is different.
14. A method according to claim 10 where the CD14 is substantially homologous to that of the human CD14 molecule. 15. An essentially pure preparation of a soluble recombinant protein substantially homologous to human CD14, produced by a. expressing an isolated nucleic acid fragment that is substantially homologous to a nucleic acid that encodes human CD14 in an e_xpression system selected from the group of expression systems that comprises plasmids and viruses that can used to express recombinant proteins, and b. purifying the recombinant protein that is expressed by said expression system. 16. The expression system of claim 15, in which
Baculovirus is used to express the recombinant protein.
