<ABSTRACT>
The invention is drawn to the field of polymer purification. Two separate embodiments are presented to remove residual monomer from the polymer product. The first embodiment is the treatment of polyvinylpyrrolidone having a Fitkenscher K value of 10-90, to a monomer content of 
<
 1 ppm. A 20-40 % aqueous solution of the polymer is passed through a stationary bed of activated carbon, residence time of the solution is 70-400 minutes and temperature is 20-90  DEG C. In the second embodiment of the invention, the residual monomers from polyvinylpyrrolidone and vinylcaprolactam are treated in an acid slurry of pH 
<
 5 containing from about 1-30 % by weight solids. Acid treatment is conducted at a temperature from about 50-150  DEG C and for a period of about 0.5-10 hours so monomer content is 
<
 5 ppm.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes using activated carbon for
the purification of polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyvinylcaprolactan, from
residual monomer.In US-A-4 795 802, Example 5, activated carbon is suspended
in a polyvinylpyrrolidone for 6 hours. The vinylpyrrolidone monomer
content was reduced to 23 ppm.In the present invention, a continuous,
liquid phase process produces purified polyvinylpyrrolidone
(PVP) having a residual vinylpyrrolidone (VP) level of < 1
ppm and comprises:
(a) continuously passing an aqueous solution of
crude PVP at a concentration of 20-40%, and having a
Fitkenscher K-value of 10-90, through a stationary bed of
granular activated carbon, at a temperature of
20-90째C.;(b) retaining the solution in contact with the
activated carbon for a residence time of at least 50
minutes;(c) collecting the purified PVP solution with at
least a throughput of 10 g crude PVP (100% basis)/g Carbon
used, and(d) separating the purified PVP product from the
water.The crude PVP solutions to be treated usually
contain PVP having a K-value (Fitkenscher) of 10-90;
however, a K-value in the range of 15-60 is preferred
because higher K-values may be too viscous to provide
suitable concentrated aqueous solutions for commercial
use. The most preferred K-values are 15 to 30.Similarly, the upper limit on the concentration of
the crude aqueous PVP solution is determined by the
viscosity of the solution. For example, a concentration of
about 30-40% by weight is suitable for K-values of PVP of
15-60, while a concentration of about 20-30% is preferred
for a K-90 PVP.The process is run at a temperature of about
20-90째C., preferably about 30-50째C. The granular activated carbon used herein suitably
has a mesh size between about 20 x 50 mesh (small particle
size) to about 4 x 15 mesh (larger particle size). Typical
of the activated carbons suitable for use in the invention
are those available from the Calgon Carbon Corp. The
Calgon products designated as types PCB and CPG Granular
are considered most effective in the process of the
invention. PCB-Granular of 12 x 30 mesh is a particularly
preferred activated carbon.The bed weight of the granular activated carbon
used in the packed stationary column is predetermined by
the volume of the column itself. In accordance with this
invention, the efficiency of the process is established by
the amount of crude PVP which can be purified to a residual
level of VP of < 1 ppm for a given bed weight of the
granular activated carbon used. A feature of this
invention is that such
