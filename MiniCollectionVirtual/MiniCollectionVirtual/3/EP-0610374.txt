Method for the measurement of inclinations of boundary surfaces 
in an optical system, wherein a light beam is collimated into a 

boundary surface respectively to be examined and the inclination of 
the boundary surface respectively to be examined relative to a 

reference axis is ascertained from the deviation of a wave front, 
which is reflected by the boundary surface to be examined, from the 

reference axis on a position-sensitive photo-detection system, 
characterised thereby, that 


a) the light beam is divided into a test beam and a reference beam, 
b) the reference beam is guided by way of reference beam path to a 
reference mirror preferably arranged perpendicularly to the 

optical axis of the reference beam, 
c) the reference beam is tuned to the same optical path length as 
that of the test beam to the boundary surface respectively to be 

examined, 
d) the coherence length of the light beam is chosen to be shorter 
than the shortest optical path length between the boundary 

surface respectively to be examined and the nearest boundary 
surface, which produces disturbing reflections, of the optical

e) the optical path length difference between the reference beam and 
the test beam to the boundary surface to be examined is modulated

f) the wave front, which is reflected by the boundary surface 
respectively to be examined, is imaged onto the position-sensitive 

photo-detection system and there superimposed by the

an interferogram, which is intensity-modulated in time, arises on 
the position-sensitive photo-detection system, and 
g) the modulated signal component, which is produced by the 
interferogram, which is intensity-modulated in time, is initially 

separated from the unmodulated signal components, which are 
produced by the disturbing reflections and the reference beam, by
