<ABSTRACT>
Electrically conductive compositions of carbon particles having thin coatings of conductive polymer are disclosed. The thin coatings of conductive polymer electrically interact with each carbon particle and protect the carbon particles from conductive failure. Because the conductive compositions of coated carbon particles maintain their conductive characteristics even after long term exposure to chemicals, they are useful as filler materials in polymer compositions utilized to fabricate chemical delivery devices.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conductive carbon black
particles having improved performance as a filler material
and improved dispersability within a matrix material.
More particularly, the present invention involves
compositions of carbon black particles having coatings of
conductive polymer which electrically and physically
interact with the carbon black particle to protect the carbon black
particle from conductive failure and provide an effective
interface between the carbon black particle and a matrix
material, such as a polymer.Carbon has found extensive utility recently in a
variety of applications where its electrical conductivity,
low density, low cost, and ease of processing are
especially attractive. In particular, carbon in the form
of particulates such as carbon black is widely used as a
conductive filler material for polymers utilized to
fabricate housings for electronic equipment, floor mats
for electronic assembly areas, volatile chemical and fuel
transport lines, conductive adhesives, electronic
components and storage bins. The usefulness of carbon
black in these applications is primarily attributed to its
low density and its ability to dissipate accumulated
static charges as well as prevent the build-up of static
charges.The static dissipation property of carbon prevents
possible catastrophic explosions and/or fires which can
result when charges accumulate and discharge in the form
of sparks during the movement of fuels or volatile 
chemicals through polymeric transport lines. In the case
of its utility in electronic housings, the static
dissipation property prevents potentially damaging loss of
data or equipment malfunction caused by discharging sparks
from static charges which have built-up on the housing.
Additionally, carbon filled composites can be pressed and
molded to form and retain almost any shape.Additionally carbon particulates or monolithic
devices fabricated from carbon are useful in fabricating
batteries and electrodes. Again, the low density and
electrical conductivity of carbon makes this material
attractive in applications where light weight conductive
materials are preferred.One problem associated with relying upon the
conductive properties of carbon over an extended period of
time relates to its highly adsorbent surface. In addition
to being useful for its conductive properties, carbon is
suitable for purifying and removing unwanted and
especially highly colored components in liquid mixtures.
Because the surface of carbon particles is a particularly
good adsorbent
