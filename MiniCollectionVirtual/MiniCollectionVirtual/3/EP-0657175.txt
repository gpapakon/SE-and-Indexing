<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides novel uses of EGF and vaccine 
compositions comprising EGF.

 
In particularly autologous EGF, or a fragment or a derivative 

thereof is used as an active immunisation against the 
proliferation of EGF-dependent tumours, or other EGF-dependent 

diseases.
 

Autologous EGF is preferably coupled to a carrier protein, 
such as Tetanus toxoid or Cholera toxin B chain.

 
The vaccine compositions according to the invention will 

usually comprise an adjuvant such as aluminium hydroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of immunology, in
particular to vaccine compositions able to produce an auto-immune
reaction against autologous (self) Epidermal Growth
Factor (EGF).An important object of this invention is to obtain a
vaccine composition for the active immunotherapy of EGF
dependent malignant tumors, which can inhibit the
proliferation of those tumors, and which therefore are useful
for the treatment of malignant neoplasms and of other EGF
related diseases. Thus, the invention is also related to the
field of cancer therapy.Epidermal Growth Factor, a polypeptide that stimulates
epithelial cell proliferation, has been considered to be one
of the growth factors involved in malignant transformations.
Its action is mainly performed via its membrane receptors.Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a 53 amino acid
polypeptide, its molecular weight is about 6045 D. It was
isolated and purified for the first time from the murine
submaxillary gland (Cohen S. J.Biol Chem (1962) 237,1.555),
later a similar molecule was obtained from human urine (Cohen
S. Human Epidermal Growth factor: Isolation and Chemical and
Biological Properties PNAS USA 72,1975 1 317).EGF is capable of stimulating the proliferation of
epithelial and mesenchymal cells, both in vitro and in vivo
(Cohen S., Carpenter G., PNAS USA 72, 1317, 1975) and EGF
gives a specific stimulation in some breast cancer cell lines
(Osborne C.K. et al. Can Res. 40,2.361 (1980). A role of the
EGF in the differentiation process of the mammary gland, 
mainly for the development of the lobule alveolar system has
been demonstrated(Tonelli C.J. Nature (1980) 285, 250-252).This bio-regulating action is exerted via a membrane
receptor (EGF-R), a 1,186 amino acid glycoprotein of about 170
kD, the gene of which has been cloned and sequenced. The
intracellular domain of the receptor is associated with an
activity of Tyrosine specific protein kinase which shows a
structural homology to the oncogene product v-erb-B showing
the relation to the malignant transformation process (Heldin
C.H. Cell 37, 9-20 (1984)).EGF and its receptor constitute a molecular complex of
high specificity and the interaction between them develops
important mechanisms of cell growth regulation.High levels of EGF-R have been detected in malignant
tumors of epithelial origin, such as breast, bladder, ovarian,
vulva, colonic, pulmonary, brain and oesophagus cancers. The
role played by EGF and its receptor in regulating tumor growth
is unknown, but there are suggestions that the EGF-R
expressio
