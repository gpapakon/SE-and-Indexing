<ABSTRACT>
A method of infecting insects is disclosed; the method utilizes a form of a baculovirus which is highly efficient at establishing infection and is normally destined to become occluded within the polyhedrin or granulin - Pre-occluded Virus (POV). Specifically, the POV as derived from a polyhedrin-minus or granulin-minus (lacking a functional polyhedrin or granulin gene) baculovirus is fed to insect larvae per os resulting in high infection rates. The discovery of the POV form of polyhedrin-minus baculoviruses was essential to our invention of the novel method of infecting insect larvae per os using the POV form of polyhedrin-minus baculovirus, and as such is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to Pre-occluded baculovirus
particles; particularly to Pre-occluded virus particles
derived from baculoviruses which have been genetically
altered such that they lack a functional polyhedrin or
granulin gene, and to the use of said particles to infect
insect larvae per os.It is generally recognized that there are two
infectious forms of baculoviruses. Early in the
replication cycle, baculoviruses produce nucleocapsids in
the nucleus of a host cell which bud through the nuclear
membrane into the cytoplasm and subsequently bud through
the plasma membrane. These extracellular virus particles
are referred to as budded virus or nonoccluded virus (NOV).
The NOV are highly infectious to susceptible insect tissue
culture cells. Insect larvae can be infected by injection
of NOV into the hemocoel (circulatory system). However,
NOV is generally recognized as non-infectious when
administered per os (feeding) to larvae. Generally, only
very low infections rates can be achieved with high
concentrations of NOV using per os larval inoculations.
Accordingly, the NOV have been used to infect larvae per os
only in rare instances and in the absence of other
alternatives.Late in a baculovirus replication cycle, the
nucleocapsids do not bud through the nuclear membrane, and
they become membrane bound within the cell nucleus. At the
same time baculovirus polyhedrin or granulin genes are
transcribed and translated producing large amounts of 
protein which crystallize around the membrane-bound
nucleocapsids present in the nucleus. These protein
crystals containing virus particles have historically been
referred to as granules with granulosis viruses and
polyhedra with nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (both are types
of baculoviruses). It is well known in the art that
granulin and polyhedrin are functionally identical and are
maintained in baculoviruses that are functional identical
and have been termed differently due to historical
precedent.The granules and polyhedra of baculoviruses are used
to efficiently infect susceptible host larvae through per
os inoculations. The alkaline pH in the larval gut region
results in dissolution of the crystalline protein
surrounding the occluded virus (OV) particles. Following
release from the crystal, the OV particles are able to
efficiently infect larval gut cells. Although highly
infectious per os, the OV particles are generally
recognized as having an extremely low potential to initiate
infections with tissue culture cells or by injection into
the hemocoel of

A method of infecting an insect larva 
per os
 with at least one pre-occluded virus particle, a
form of a baculovirus which is highly efficient at establishing infection and is

normally destined to become occluded within the polyhedrin, comprising the steps of:

a. infecting at least one insect larva with a baculovirus lacking a functional polyhedrin
or granulin gene;
b. incubating the infected insect larva to allow for the pre-occluded virus particles
derived from said baculovirus to form in said insect larva;
c. disrupting said infected insect larva, which is housing said pre-occluded virus
particles;
d. stabilizing the infectivity of the pre-occluded virus particles in the disrupted larva
by freeze-drying; and
e. feeding the disrupted larval cells and said stabilized pre-occluded virus particles 
per
os
 an insect larva.
The method of claim 1, wherein, in step (b), the infected insect larva is incubated for at
least thirty hours.
The method of claim 1 wherein said pre-occluded virus particle maintains and expresses a
foreign gene product but not a polyhedrin or granulin gene.
The method of claim 3, wherein said foreign gene codes for a pesticidal protein.
The method of claim 3, wherein said foreign gene codes for an enzyme or therapeutic
protein.
The method of claim 3, wherein said foreign gene codes for a protein that may be used as a
vaccine.
A method of making at least one stabilized pre-occluded virus particle, a form of a
baculovirus which is highly efficient at establishing infection and is normally destined

to become occluded within the polyhedrin, comprising the steps of:

a. infecting at least one insect larva with baculoviruses lacking a functional polyhedrin
or granulin gene; 
b. incubating the infected insect larva to allow for the pre-occluded virus particles
derived from said baculovirus to form in said insect larva;
c. disrupting said insect host larva, which is housing said pre-occluded virus particles;

d. stabilizing the infectivity of the pre-occluded virus particles in the disrupted larva
by freeze-drying.
The method of claim 7, wherein, in step (b), the infected insect larva is incubated for at
least thirty hours.
A pesticide comprising disrupted insect cells maintaining stabilized pre-occluded virus
particles, a form of a baculovirus which is highly efficient at establishing infection and

is normally destined to become occluded within the polyhedrin, wherein said insect
cells have been infected with a polyhedrin-minus or granulin-minus baculovirus and

freeze-dried to stabilize the pre-occluded virus particles.

the environment.
A method of pest control which comprises applying a stabilized freeze-dried pre-occluded baculovirus
lacking a functional polyhedrin gene.
The method of claim 11, wherein said pre-occluded baculovirus is produced by the
