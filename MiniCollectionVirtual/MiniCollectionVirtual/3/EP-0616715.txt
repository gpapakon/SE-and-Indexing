<DESCRIPTION>
THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to exhibition apparatus.FR-A-2 665 288 discloses
an exhibition comprising a plurality of exhibits and
an apparatus comprising a compact disc in a compact disc deck associated with means
to provide an audible output and means provided to control
operation of the compact disc deck.In this Specification the term "exhibition" is to be given
a wide meaning and is intended to embrace any type of exhibition
where a number of different items are exhibited which are to be
viewed by people attending the exhibition. Thus an exhibition
may comprise an art gallery where the exhibits to be viewed
comprise pictures or paintings, a zoo where the items to be
exhibited comprise animals, cr a museum where the exhibits may
comprise any type of artefact or display item. A further example
of an exhibition may be botanical garden where the exhibits
comprise different plants.For a person visiting an exhibition to obtain the maximum
benefit, the person should be provided with information
concerning each exhibit. This can be achieved by providing a
Guide Book, but if the exhibition is of a significant size, the
Guide Book will be bulky and also it is difficult to look at an
exhibit whilst simultaneously reading a Guide Book.The present invention seeks to provide apparatus for use at
exhibitions, and an exhibition utilising such apparatus.According to one aspect of this invention there is provided
an exhibition comprising a plurality of exhibits, indicia means
identifying at least some of the exhibits, and at least one
apparatus comprising a compact disc deck associated with means
to provide an audible output, means being provided to control
operation of the compact disc deck, said control means
incorporating or being associated with a keyboard operable to
input the identity of a track present on a compact disc which is
to be played, there being a compact disc in the compact disc deck 
so that when the indicium from an exhibit is input to the
apparatus through the keyboard an audible commentary relating to
the exhibit identified by that indicium is provided.Preferably the keyboard is a numeric keyboard operable to
provide a reference number identifying a track to be played, each
indicia comprising a reference number.Conveniently the display apparatus incorporates a display
associated with the keyboard adapted to display the number keyed
into the apparatus.Advantageously the keyboard is associated with a micro-processor
which forms part of the apparatus.Conveniently memory means are provided within

<CLAIMS>
An exhibition comprising a plurality of exhibits, indicia
means identifying at least some of the exhibits, and at least one

apparatus comprising a compact disc deck associated with means
to provide an audible output, means being provided to control

operation of the compact disc deck, said control means
incorporating or being associated with a keyboard operable to

input the identity of a track present on a compact disc which is
to be played, there being a compact disc in the compact disc deck

so that when the indicium from an exhibit is input to the
apparatus through the keyboard an audible commentary relating to

the exhibit identified by that indicium is provided.
An exhibition according to Claim 1 wherein the keyboard is
a numeric keyboard operable to provide a reference number

identifying a track to be played, each indicia comprising a
reference number.
An exhibition according to Claim 2 wherein the apparatus
incorporates a display associated with the keyboard adapted to

display the number keyed into the apparatus.
