<ABSTRACT>
A method for providing a welded side seam aren in 
a plastic bag or package having interlocking male (14) and 

female (16) profile sections on plies of plastic sheeting 
material includes the provision of cut-outs (18) through 

one of the male and female profile sections and 
contiguous plastic sheeting material at preselected 

intervals therealong. The welds, which may be 
provided by a seal bar or jaws, are provided along 

lines including or passing through the cut-outs. A 
thinner and more leak-resistant side seam area between 

bags or packages is the result.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture
of plastic bags or packages having at least two plies
of thermoplastic sheeting, both plies having closure
stripe formed or included on their facing inner edges
so as to form a snap fastener-like closure for the
openings of the bags or packages made therefrom.The present invention relates to improvements in
the package-making art and may be practiced, without
limitation, in the manufacture of thermoformed bags
and thermoformed trays of the kind that may be used
for various consumer products, but which are
particularly useful for food products which should be
kept in substantially air-tight packages, free from
leakage until opened for access to the product
contents, which packages are desirably reclosable by
zipper means to protect any remainder of the product
therein.The indicated art is fairly well developed, but
nevertheless is still susceptible of improvements
contributing to increased efficiency and cost
effectiveness.One problem that still exists in the production
of packages from continuous zipper-equipped sheet
material, such as film, especially where the film and
zipper are separately formed and then joined, resides
in the difficulty in dividing the zippered film into
package-oriented sections, because the zipper is of
greater mass than the film. Another problem is represented by the difficulty
in attaining a satisfactory sealing of the zipper
against leakage, where the zipper and the area of film
engaged by the zipper extends through the side seal
areas separating one bag or package from the next.The present invention provides a solution to the
foregoing problems by requiring a cut-out to be made
through the female profile section of the plastic
zipper before a weld is applied for a permanent joint,
the weld being the means by which a side seal is
provided, which side seal also separates the zippered
film into package-oriented sections. It should be
understood that the cut-out is to be made at the point
where the weld is subsequently to be made. The weld
may be provided by a seal bar or seal jaws.While the cut-out is preferably made through the
female profile section, it may be provided in the male
profile section as an alternative. In any event, the
cut-out is to be provided through only one of the two
(male or female) sections.Since the cut-out is made through only one of the
two profile sections, one need not be concerned about
maintaining the coincidence of cut-outs made in both
the male and female profile sections, as is required
by

<CLAIMS>
A method for providing a welded seam (20) in a plastic
package having a zipper comprising:


providing a sheet (12) of plastic material having a
continuous female profile section (16);
providing a sheet of plastic material (10) having a
continuous male profile section (14);

characterized in that said method further comprises the steps
of:
punching a plurality of cut-outs (18) at preselected
intervals along one of said continuous female profile

section or continuous male profile section (16, 14), said cut-outs
(18) removing sections of one of said profile sections

and forming holes through the sheet of plastic
material contiguous therewith;
inserting said continuous male profile section (14)
into said continuous female profile section (16) to join

said sheets of plastic material (10, 12) together; and
welding said sheets of plastic material together
along lines including said cut-outs.
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said cut-outs
(18) are punched through said continuous female

profile section (16).
A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein said cut-outs
are punched through said continuous male profile

section (14).
