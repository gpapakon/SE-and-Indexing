<ABSTRACT>
A pair of E-shaped shunts (23a,23b) are disposed near the top and 
bottom, respectively, of a deflection yoke for reducing inner and outer 

horizontal trap errors. A central portion of the E-shaped shunt 
(23a,23b) reduces a ratio between magnitudes of inner and outer E-W 

pincushion raster distortions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a deflection apparatus in a color picture tube (CRT) 
display system as defined in the preamble of claim 1. Such a deflection apparatus is known, for example, from US-A-4,246,560. The electrons of each of the three electron beams of 
the CRT, R, G and B, will traverse a greater distance when 
deflected towards the edge of the viewing screen than when 
directed toward the center. Due to the separation of the electron 
guns, this may result in a separation of the landing points of the 
three electron beams when they are deflected towards the edges 
of the screen. This effect causes the light spots of the three beams 
at points on the viewing screen away from the center to be 
separated. This is known as misconvergence and results in color 
fringes about the edges of the displayed images. Misconvergence 
may be measured as a separation or distance of the ideally 
superimposed red and blue lines of a crosshatch pattern of lines 
appearing on the screen when an appropriate test signal is applied 
to the picture tube. Each of the three electron beams scans a raster which 
may be identified by its color. Thus, a green raster is ordinarily 
scanned by the center electron beam and the outside beam scan 
red and blue rasters, respectively. The crosshatch pattern is 
formed in each of the red, green and blue rasters. The crosshatch 
pattern outlines the raster with generally vertical and horizontal 
lines, and also includes other intermediate vertically and 
horizontally-directed lines. The field flux lines produced by the vertical deflection 
winding are made barrel-shaped at a portion of the yoke that is 
intermediate the gun end and the screen end of the yoke. Such 
field nonuniformity reduces misconvergence at the 12 o'clock 
point. To enhance the barrel-shaped vertical field nonuniformity, 
a pair of shunts near the top and bottom of the yoke, respectively, 
have been utilized (see the above mentioned patent US-A-4,246,560). An outer horizontal trap misconvergence error is 
defined as the separation between horizontal red and blue lines at 
the top or bottom of the screen of the CRT. An inner horizontal 
trap misconvergence error is defined at a region of the CRT screen 
midway between the top and center of the CRT screen, or midway  
 
between the bottom and center of the CRT screen. A CRT having 
an aspherical or flat faceplate may tend to introduce a significant 
difference between the outer and inner horizontal trap errors. It may be desirable to reduce the difference between 
the
