<ABSTRACT>
A device for splicing multiple optical fibers includes a novel splice element having two plates (74, 76) formed from a sheet of aluminum material, there being a fold line (70) in the sheet forming a hinge, the two plates being folded toward one another to define opposing surfaces. One of the opposing surfaces has several fiber receiving grooves (82) therein, parallel with the fold line. The aluminum is anodized prior to embossing the fiber receiving grooves. The element is inserted into the slot (26) of a splice body (14, 16) formed of an injection moldable material. The splice body may be reinforced by insert molding a steel tube (126) therein, surrounding the slot (26).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
devices for optically connecting the ends of waveguides
such as optical fibers, and more particularly to an
article which splices a plurality of pairs of such
optical fibers, the article including an insert molded
splice body and an aluminum splice element which is
anodized prior to embossing certain features thereon.Splice devices for optical fibers are known in
the art, but there is still a need for a quick and
reliable method of splicing a plurality of fibers in a
high density environment. Prior to the introduction of
splice devices which join a plurality of optical fibers
in a single splice body (discussed further below), this
was accomplished by utilizing a plurality of single fiber
(discrete) splice devices. This approach was very time
consuming, however, and further resulted in a large
volume of splice bodies which crowd junction boxes, or
require specialized splice trays to keep the fibers
organized.Several systems have been devised to address
the problem of multiple fiber splicing. One technique,
mass fusion welding, requires that each fiber be placed
in a groove of a rigid substrate having several such
grooves. Best fit averaging is used to align the fiber
pairs and an electric arc is created, melting the fiber
tips and permanently fusing them together. The primary,
and very significant, limitation of fusion splicing is 
the great expense of the fusion welders. Fusion welding
is also time consuming, and precludes later fiber removal
or repositioning.Another common multiple splicing technique
requires the use of adhesives, again with a substrate or
tray that has a plurality of grooves therein. For
example, in U.S. -A- 4,028,162, a plurality of
fibers are first aligned on a plastic substrate having
fiber aligning grooves, and then a cover plate is applied
over the fibers and the substrate, the cover plate having
means to chemically adhere to the fiber and substrate.
Adhesives are also used in the optical fiber splice
devices disclosed in U.S. -A- 4,029,390 and
JP-A- 58-158621. The
use of adhesives is generally undesirable since it adds
another step to the splicing process, and may introduce
contaminants to the fiber interfaces. Splice devices
using adhesives also require extensive polishing of the
fiber end faces to achieve acceptable light transmission,
and some adhesive splices further require the use of a
vacuum unit to remove trapped air.US-A-4029390 represents an improvement over
earlier multiple splice devices in that it utilizes a
foldable holder

<CLAIMS>
A device for splicing a first plurality of optical
fibers (96a) a second plurality of optical fibers (96b),

comprising:

an elongate splice element (18) comprising two elongate deformable plate members
(74,76) each having an inner surface opposing

the other one when the plate members (74,76) are brought
together for clamping the first and second

pluralities of optical fibers longitudinal inserted therebetween,
an elongate splice body (12) having a cavity (26)
extending along the longitudinal direction thereof

for
receiving said elongate splice element (18),
actuation means comprising a wedge (22) movable
between a first and a second position such that, when

said wedge (22) is in said first position, the
first and second pluralities of fibers may be

inserted between said opposing surfaces of said
plate members (74,76) of said splice element (18) or removed therefrom

and when said wedge (22) is in said second
position, it applies a clamping force to said

splice element (18), urging said opposing surfaces
together to clamp said optical fibers, and
means for reinforcing said splice body (12), said
reinforcing means including a steel tube (126)

located inside said splice body (12),
wherein at least one of said deformable plate members (74,76)
of said splice element (18) has raised

stop pads (90) at corners of the inner surface
thereof for providing a clearance space between

said plate members (74,76) when the wedge (22) is
in its first position, so as to facilitate the insertion or

removal of the fibers, and
wherein said wedge (22) is arranged to be longitudinally slidable
between said first and second position

which are longitudinally distant from each other,
so as to 

exert,
when said wedge (22) is in its second position,

a clamping force which is maximal only in the central part of
said splice element (18)

and gradually decreases
towards the ends thereof.
The device of claim 1, wherein:

said splice body (12) is formed of an injection
moldable material and includes a jacket member

(14) having a slot (26) therein for receiving said
splice element (18), and a cap member (16) having

a recess (30) for receiving an end (28) of said
jacket member (14), and
said steel tube (126) is insert molded inside said
jacket member (14), at least partially surrounding

said slot (26).
The device of claim 1, wherein each plate member
(74,76) is formed from aluminium, and each of said

opposing surfaces has an anodized layer.
