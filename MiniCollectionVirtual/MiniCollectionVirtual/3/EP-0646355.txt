<ABSTRACT>
An anvil assembly 10 for use with a circular surgical 
stapling device having a housing 12 and venting means, in 

the form of vent holes 20, 22, for venting the interior of 
the anvil assembly. The housing includes channeling means 

46, 48 in the form of a plurality of longitudinally 
extending and radially spaced surface grooves in an outer 

surface of the housing which are communicable with the vent 
holes to aid in directing a flow of air between the vent 

holes and the outer surface of the housing member to 
significantly reduce a suction effect therebetween. The 

channeling means further allows extruded tissue and debris 
to flow freely from the vent holes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a surgical stapling 
instrument for joining hollow body organs and more 
particularly to a vented anvil assembly having channels for 
facilitating flow of gas, tissue and other debris between 
outer and inner surfaces of the anvil assembly during use. Heretofore, it has been known to use surgical staplers 
to connect hollow body organs. Typically, the stapling 
device consists of a handle portion, an elongated portion, 
a staple carrying portion, and an anvil carrying portion. 
In use, the anvil carrying portion is positioned in one 
hollow body organ and the stapling carrying portion of the 
instrument is positioned in a second hollow body organ. The 
anvil carrying portion is then attached to the staple 
carrying portion and retracted towards the staple carrying 
portion, thereby drawing the two hollow body organs 
together into an abutting relationship. As the tissue 
sections are drawn together, air, tissue and other debris 
are usually trapped and compressed in the confined space 
between the staple carrying portion and the anvil carrying 
portion. This can result in undesirable pressure build up 
in the space between the anvil and staple carrier, which 
can interfere with the anastomosis. When the tissue is sufficiently drawn or clamped 
together, the instrument is fired to eject the staples from 
the staple carrying portion. The staples pass through the  
 
clamped tissue sections and are formed against the anvil 
carrying portion thereby securing the tissue sections 
together. Subsequently, a circular knife member is 
advanced through excess tissue and into a knife abutment 
ring on the anvil. Movement of the knife within the 
confined space between the staple carrying portion and the 
anvil carrying portion further reduces the volume of space 
in which excess tissue fluid and other debris are trapped. 
Because tissue and fluids are relatively incompressible, 
this additional reduction in volume can also create high 
pressures and tissue trauma in the confined space. To relieve this undesirable increase in pressure in 
the confined space, several instruments have been provided 
with venting means, in the form of vent holes, in the anvil 
and staple carrying portions leading outward from the 
enclosed space. Examples of such venting means can be 
found in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Nos. 4,406,343; 
4,603,693; and 4,573,468 to Conta et al.; and 4,351,466 to 
Noiles. It has been observed that without the vent holes 
there is a tendency for the tissue to extrude outward
