<CLAIMS>
Tracer system for fault analysis of programs in 
running real-time systems, having
 
a monitoring means (SFG) which determines the dynamic 

load on the real-time system caused by the tracer system 
and deactivates the tracer system if this dynamic load 

exceeds at least one specific threshold value. 
Tracer system according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the monitoring means (SFG) determines the dynamic 

load on the real-time system caused by the tracer system 
by measuring the frequency of the arriving trace points 

and the average activity per trace point or activity 
within a specific (measurement) time period. 
Tracer system according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that 


a) the monitoring means (SFG) has an interface to a 
system component of the real-time system, for 

example an overload protection system (UEL), via 
which, in the event of an overload, it receives 

information about the prevailing overload level, 
b) the monitoring means deactivates the tracer system 
whe
n a specific overload level has been reached. 
Tracer system according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the specific over load level can be varied by the 

operator or by other parts of the system. 
Tracer system according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the monitoring means can be 

switched off unconditionally by the operator or by other 
parts of the system. 
Tracer system according to one of Claims 1 to 5,  
 

characterized in that the tracer system is jointly 
implemented as a software system in the real-time system, 

or partially on external system components. 
Tracer system according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that 


a) the tracer system is jointly implemented as a software 
system in the real-time system or partially on 

external system components, and 
b) the monitoring means carries out the deactivation of 
the tracer system in the event of an overload step-by-step.
