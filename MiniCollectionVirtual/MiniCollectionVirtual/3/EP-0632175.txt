<ABSTRACT>
Supporting cables (2) are braced between two rows of uprights (1). Running on said cables are carriers (3) on which a covering tarpaulin (4) is hung. The supporting cable (2) is guided through the upright (1) and projects through a concave bearing shell (50) by means of its end-side bracing bar (20). Located in the bearing shell is a rolling body (52) through which the bracing bar (20) is likewise guided and is secured on the rear by means of a nut (54). The radius of the rolling body (52) is smaller than the radius of the concave bearing surface of the bearing shell (50). Despite the constantly changing sag of the supporting cable, the latter is thus connected to the upright (1) in a warp-free manner.
