<ABSTRACT>
Contaminated soils are treated in a drum (5) in a slurry with addition of grinding elements. The discharged slurry is separated into a fine fraction and a coarse fraction at about 1 mm. The fine fraction is passed into a buffer vessel (23). The coarse fraction is ground to a grain size below about 1 mm and then passed into the buffer vessel (23). A suspension is prepared in the buffer vessel by addition of solvent. The suspension is filtered in a pressure housing (29) with addition of steam. Filtrate and condensate are passed into a settling tank (48). The filter cake is resuspended with addition of solvent, the suspension is filtered again and the filter cake resulting in the course of this is discharged as clean soil. The solid separated off in the settling tank (48) is returned to the filtration. The pollutant-laden liquid is freed from the pollutants, the solvent is returned to the process and the pollutants separated off are disposed of.

A method for dressing contaminated soils in which 
the contaminated soils are treated in a drum (5) in a 

slurry with the addition of loose chunks acting in the 
manner of grindi
ng bodies with a net energy consumption 
(energy consumption in the filled state, minus the 

energy consumption in the empty state) of 1 to 
16 kWh/tonne throughput and at a speed of rotation of 

50-90% of the critical speed (n
crit
) of 

n
crit
 = 
42.4
√D
 (min
-1
), 
 
wherein D = diameter of the drum in metres, and the 

slurry discharged from the drum (5) is separated into a 
fine fraction having a grain size of below about 1 mm 

and a coarse fraction having a grain size of above 
about 1 mm, characterised in that 


a) the fine fraction is passed into a stirred buffer 
vessel (23), 
b) the coarse fraction is ground to a grain size of 
below about 1 mm and is then passed into the 

buffer vessel (23), 
c) the suspension from the buffer vessel (23) is 
passed into a stirred receptacle (27), and a 

suspension having a solids content of 200 to 
800 g/l is produced by adding solvent, 
d) the suspension from the receptacle (27) is applied 
as a layer to the filter base of a filter in a 

pressure housing (29), steam at a temperature of 
100 to 300°C and a pressure of 1 to 12 bar is 

introduced into the pressure housing (29) and is  
 

passed through the layer, the filtrate emerging 
from the filter base and steam condensate from the 

pressure housing (29) are removed, and the steam 
emerging from the filter base is condensed and 

removed as condensate, the filter cake is 
discharged from the pressure housing (29), 
e) in the trough of the filter of (d) an additional 
movement is produced in the suspension, 
f) the discharged filter cake is passed into a 
stirred preparation vessel (35), a suspension 

having a solids content of 200 to 800 g/l is 
produced with the addition of solvent, and the 

suspension is then passed back into the pressure 
housing (29) of (d), 
g) the filter cake after the treatment according to 
(f) is removed as clean soil, 
h) the filtrate and condensate of (d) and (f) are 
cooled and passed into a settling tank, 
i) the solids separated off from the settling tank 
are re-introduced into the pressure housing (29) 

of (d) and/or (f), 
j) the liquid laden with pollutants is freed of the 
pollutants in a solvent recovery stage and is 

returned into the process, and 
k) the pollutants which have been separated off are 
disposed of. 
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that the coarse fraction produced is sorted into heavy 

material and light material, the heavy material of the  
 

coarse fraction is ground to a grain size below about 
1 mm according to (b) and is passed into the buffer 

vessel, and the light material of the coarse fraction 
is disposed of.
