<ABSTRACT>
An integrated device (1) comprising two metal 
levels (6, 8) separated by a layer of insulating 

material (3) and connected (10) electrically at 
respective contact pads (5, 7) located one over the 

other. The two pads (5, 7) are connected electrically by 
a number of parallel contact regions (10) having a much 

smaller cross sectional area as compared with the 
contact pads (5, 7). The contact regions (10) are so 

formed as to terminate close to the side of the lower 
contact pad (5) from which a respective metal line (4) 

extends, and are covered by the final passivation layer 
(12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a multiple-metal-level
integrated device and fabrication process
thereof, according to the preamble of claim 1 and, respectively,
claim 3.As known, when fabricating integrated devices
comprising thin oxide layers, these are subject to
damage at various stages of the dry etching processes,
thus impairing the efficiency and/or reliability of the
devices.Especially critical is the plasma etching process
for forming the contacts between the lower metal levels
and the upper level. On multiple-metal-level devices, in
fact, the bottom layers are contacted by means of an
electric connecting structure through the intermediate
insulating layers. In particular, in the areas in which
the electric contacts of the device are formed, the
underlying metal levels are patterned into bonding pads
of appropriate and fairly extensive area, and the
contacts are formed by plasma etching the intermediate
dielectric layers over the pads, so as to form openings 
with a cross section of slightly less than the pad area,
and then depositing a metal layer to fill the openings
and form the contact.Plasma etching the contacts towards the first
metal level is especially critical by virtue of the
first level, at which etching is stopped, contacting the
thin oxide layers (less than 150 Å thick for tunnel
oxides, and not much thicker for gate oxides), and being
connected to the upper armatures of the capacitors. The
extensive contact area of the bonding pads permits
capture by the metal pad of a substantial electric
charge (antenna effect) highly capable of resulting in
electrostatic discharge through the thin oxide layers.To safeguard the thin oxides against electric
discharge, provision is currently made for structures
formed on the same die and designed to absorb high
voltage peaks without transferring them to the active
circuits. Such structures, however, are not provided on
process characterization test devices, particularly for
direct measurement of the deficiency and reliability of
the oxide layers, so that, in these cases at least,
other techniques are required for safeguarding the oxide
layers during fabrication. In general, however,
straightforward structures are desirable, capable of
eliminating or at least partly solving the problem of
electrostatic discharge resulting from the capture of
electric charges.An integrated device of the type defined in the preamble of
claim 1 is disclosed in EP-A-0 519 665, wherein, for
planarizing a multi-layer metal bonding, a contact
structure is proposed,
