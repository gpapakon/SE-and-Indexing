<ABSTRACT>
An internal combustion engine with two cylinder banks at a V-angle of 180@ has a crankshaft provided with a flywheel, which shaft has adjacent to the flywheel a drive for a parallel intermediate shaft. One camshaft for each cylinder bank is driven from each of the two ends of the said intermediate shaft. The arrangement of the drive for the intermediate shaft close to the flywheel avoids the transmission of torsional vibrations of the crankshaft to the intermediate shaft.

<CLAIMS>
An internal-combustion engine with two rows of cylinders, a crankshaft (1) provided 
with a flywheel (5), and an intermediate shaft (7) driven by the said crankshaft (1) and 

arranged parallel thereto, with at least one camshaft (10, 13) - 
per
 row of cylinders - 
connected in a driving manner to the intermediate shaft (7), wherein a first drive connexion 

(9) for one camshaft (10) is mounted on an end region (8) of the intermediate 
shaft (7) remote from the flywheel and a second drive connexion (12) for the other 

camshaft (13) is mounted on an end region (11) of the intermediate shaft (7) close to the 
flywheel, 
characterized in that
 the drive (6) of the intermediate shaft (7) is mounted on 
an end portion (4) of the crankshaft (1) supporting the flywheel (5), and in the assembled 

position of the internal-combustion engine the intermediate shaft (7) extends below the 
crankshaft (1). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the intermediate 
shaft (7) extends in a vertical plane of symmetry (
E-E
) which passes through a 
longitudinal axis (
A-A
) of the crankshaft (1). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
drive (6) of the intermediate shaft (7) is mounted between the second drive connexion 

(12) and the flywheel (5). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 each row of 
cylinders has a second camshaft (14, 15) which is driven by the respective first camshaft 

(10, 13) with the interposition of a gearing (16), wherein the gearing (16) is arranged 
substantially centrally with respect to the longitudinal extension of the camshafts (10, 13, 

14, 15). 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the end 
region (8) of the intermediate shaft (7) remote from the flywheel has a rotary drive (17) 

for an accessory. 
An internal-combustion engine according to Claims 1 and 5, 
characterized in that
 along 
the intermediate shaft (7) the rotary drive (17) is arranged first and adjacent thereto the 

first drive connexion (9), and at a distance therefrom the second drive connexion (12) 
and then the drive (6) of the intermediate shaft (7).
