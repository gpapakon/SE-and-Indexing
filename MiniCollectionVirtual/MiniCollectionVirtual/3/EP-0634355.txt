<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to people moving
devices in general, and to treadplates for people moving
devices in particular.Escalators, moving walkways, and other people
moving devices efficiently move a large volume of
pedestrian traffic from one point to another.
Passengers step on moving treadplates (or belts, or
pallets, or steps, etc.) and are transported along at a
constant rate of speed.The treadplates are attached to a step chain which
travels in a closed loop from a first landing of the
people moving device to a second landing and back.
Specifically, the treadplates exit the first landing and
travel exposed from the first landing to the second
landing. From there, the steps reverse direction within
the second landing and return to the first landing
concealed within the frame of the device. Finally, the
steps reverse direction within the first landing,
thereby completing the loop.A person of ordinary skill in the art will
recognize that safety is a significant concern in the
entry and exit points of a people moving device.
Passengers go from stepping on a surface at a zero
velocity to stepping on a surface at a constant velocity
greater than zero. As a result, there is an opportunity
for a passenger to lose his or her balance.Numerous solutions have been offered to address
these safety concerns. In some cases, for example,
cautionary signs are deployed near the entry and exit
points. These signs must be positioned out of the
moving path, however, or they too become a safety
hazard. Positioning the signs out of the moving path
decreases the effectiveness of the warning and detracts 
aesthetically. In other cases, cautionary colors are
painted on either the treadplates or the landing entry
(typically called the combplate) to highlight the
difference in velocity between the parts. The
difficulty with a painted coating is that the paint
wears off relatively quickly and therefore increases
maintenance costs as well as creating an aesthetic
blemish.In still other instances the treadplates are
machined to accept cautionary colored plastic inserts
which are typically riveted to the step. A disadvantage
of this approach is that the machining process
significantly increases the cost of the treadplates. In
addition, if the insert works free from the treadplate,
the now loose insert and the machined treadplate become
a safety hazard. Another disadvantage of machining the
step is that the plastic insert cannot be attached to
the forward edge of the treadplate. The machining step
necessary to make room for
