<ABSTRACT>
A dye is fixed to a solid material by using a diene or 
dienophile as the dye, incorporating a dienophile or diene 

into the solid material, effecting Diels-Alder reaction 
between the diene and the dienophile or between the dye and 

the solid material for binding the dye to the solid 
material. The dyed solid material has an increased dye 

concentration and prevents dye diffusion with the lapse of 
time.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel dye fixing method for 
binding dyes to solid materials utilizing Diels-Alder 
reaction. Binding or fixation of dyes to solid materials is used 
in a variety of applications, for example, sublimation type 
thermal transfer processes, silver salt color diffusion 
transfer processes, ink jet recording processes, and dyeing 
processes. For acceptable binding, an increased binding rate 
and/or a high binding concentration is required. It is also 
essential that after dye binding, the dye is immobile with 
the lapse of time. Those dyes having a low molecular weight 
are likely to diffuse into solid material and thus easy to 
bind, but they are undesirably mobile after binding with the 
lapse of time. Inversely, those dyes which remain immobile 
after binding with the lapse of time are difficult to bind. A number of solutions to the above-mentioned problem 
have been proposed. Such proposals include Japanese Patent 
Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 64591/1982, 78893/1984, 
260060/1985, 260381/1985, 260391/1985, and 97887/1987, 
Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) No. 11678/1987, 
International Symposium on Polymeric Amine and Ammonium 
Salts, (1979.1X.24-26), pp. 145-148, Photogr. Sci. Eng., 20, 
155 (1976), and J. Soc. Dyers & Colourists, 79, 21 (1963). 
However, none of them are satisfactory.  
 An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel method for fixing a dye to a solid material utilizing 
Diels-Alder reaction, with the advantages of ease of dye 
binding and prohibited diffusion of the once bound dye with 
the lapse of time. According to the present invention, there is provided a 
method for binding a dye to a solid material utilizing 
Diels-Alder reaction comprising the steps of using a dye 
having a diene moiety as the dye, incorporating a dienophile 
into the solid material, and effecting Diels-Alder reaction 
between the diene and the dienophile for fixing the dye to 
the solid material. Preferably the dye having a diene moiety is of the 
following general formula (I): 
A-(B-X)n 
wherein 
A is a dye main portion, B is a valence bond or a divalent linkage group, X is CR1(R2)=CR3-CR4=CR5(R6) wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, 
and R6 are independently selected from a hydrogen atom and a 
group of non-metallic atoms, at least one of combinations R1 
and R5, R3 and R4, R1 and R2, R1 and R3 (or R2 and R3), and 
R4 and R5 (or R4 and R6), taken together, may form a ring, B may be attached to X at any one of R1 to R6 of X, or 
B may be directly attached to the diene
