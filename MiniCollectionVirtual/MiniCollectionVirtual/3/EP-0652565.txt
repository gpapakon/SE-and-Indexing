<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor memory device includes at least one 
word line, at least one memory cell coupled to the word line, 

a decoder circuit responding to address information to 
generate a word line drive signal taking one of an active 

level and an inactive level, a signal generator generating a 
reset signal tacking an active level in a reset mode and an 

inactive level in a selection mode, and a word line driver 
coupled to receive said word line drive signal and said reset 

signal and to said word line. The word line driver includes 
a first drive circuit responding to the active level of the 

reset signal to drive the word line to a non-selection level 
and maintaining the word line at the non-selection level when 

the word line drive signal and the reset signal are at the 
inactive level. A second drive circuit responds to the 

active level of the word line drive signal and the inactive 
level of the reset signal to drive the word line to a 

selection level.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
memory device, and more particularly, to a semiconductor
memory device in which wiring patterns can be simplified and
in which word lines are held at a predetermined potential
level so as not to float.The integration density is remarkably increased in a
semiconductor memory device with the advanced fine processing
technology. Specifically, in a dynamic RAM (DRAM) in which
the structure of a memory cell is very simple, the increase
in the integration density is remarkable. 16-Mbit DRAM is
mass-produced at present and 64-Mbit DRAM is now being
forwarded as a sample.In the 64-Mbit DRAM there is proposed as one example
a divisional decoding type of semiconductor memory device in
which each of word lines is divided into a plurality of
sections such that memory cells can be accessed at a higher
speed and a driver is provided for some of the divided
sections. Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing such a
divisional decoding type of semiconductor memory device.Memory cells MCmn (m and n are integers and equal to
or more than 0) are divided into a plurality blocks and a
part of one block is shown in Fig. 1. The memory cells in 
each of the plurality of blocks is further divided into a
plurality of subblocks, e.g.,there are the memory cells MC00,
MC10, MC20 and MC30 in one subblock. A plurality of word
line driving circuits 52a, 52b, ..., 53a, 53b, ..., 54a, 54b,
... are scatteredly provided in the block in a matrix manner.
Sets of word line driving circuits in a row direction are
respectively connected to sets of word line driving signal
WLP0, WLP1, WLP2, ... and word line reset signal WLP0',
WLP1', WLP2', ..., such that the word line driving circuits
in one set are commonly supplied with the set of signals. A
row decoder 51 decodes a part of a row address of an external
address to generate the word line driving signals and word
line reset signals in response to a word line precharge
signal P from a circuit 58 which also generates a bit line
precharge signal (not shown). Drive current supply circuits
57a to 57d decode lower two bits of the row address to
generate word line selection signals RA0, RA1, RA2 and RA3 in
accordance with the decoded result and supply word line
driving current to sets of word line driving circuits,
respectively. A pair of word line selection signals RA0 and
RA2 and another pair of word line selection signals RA1 and
RA3 are alternatively supplied to sets of word line driving
circuits in a column direction. For instance, when the word
line
