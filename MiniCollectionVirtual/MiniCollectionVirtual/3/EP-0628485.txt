<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is for a liquid tight sealed packaging 
which is obtained by folding of a flat sheet. One side of the 

sheet has a barrier material which is impermeable for the 
liquid product, for which the packaging is intended. The 

packaging can easily be opened and with satisfying result be 
closed again. The packaging is also cheap to produce and 

empty packagings take up little space. 
The packaging comprises a bottom 1 surrounded by short sides 
2, 3 and long sides 4, 5. The sides are joined by corner 

parts which by a folding line 14 are separated in two parts 
12 and 13. At each longer side 4, 5 there is a lid part 6, 10 

the size of which is essentially the same as that of the 
bottom 1. One lid part 6 is intended to be a lower lid and is 

separated by a perforation 9 into an inner part 7 and a 
surrounding border 8. On each short side 2, 3 there is a flap 

15, which also comprises and edge 18 delimited to the shorter 
side and the outer part of the flap by two folding lines 16, 

17.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is for a liquid sealed packaging which
is obtained by folding of a flat sheet. One side of the sheet
has a barrier material which is impermeable for the liquid
product for which the packaging shall be used. The packaging
is primarily intended for viscous products such as paint,
glue etc., which require large opening during use. Packagings of
the kind which are used e.g. for drinks are not suitable for
this purpose.The packagings which have hereto been used for paint, glue
and the like products are mainly cans of metal or plastic.
Usually these have a cylindrical shape which by sorting and
handling in the warehouses on loading pallets etc. means that
only about 60 % of the available volume can be used. Other
drawbacks of these packagings are that the lids can be
difficult to open or require special tools for opening.
In certain cases the resealing of the packaging may cause
problems either because it is not intended to be resealed
or because the lids have been deformed by opening.The present invention is for a liquid sealed packaging which
makes it possible to use the entire volume which is available
in the space for storing and handling. The packaging can
easily be opened and resealed with sufficient result. The
packaging is also cheap to produce and empty packagings have
small volume.A packaging which is suitable for moist and greasy goods is
disclosed in FR-A-2 564 427. This packaging comprises a bottom
and four side walls. Integral with the side walls there are
corner parts which are folded in such a way that they are
positioned along the shorter sides of the packaging and
locked in that position by flaps extending from the inner 
parts of the side walls and folded over the corner parts.
The flaps have extensions which are bent 90Â° thereto and
inserted into adjacent longer sides. The packaging has no lid
or cover. This packaging can, therefore, not be used for
handling liquid goods.US-A-4930639 discloses a leakproof packaging for cooking
food, having one lid only which is glued on side wall flanges
and corner part flanges, and which has perforations. The
packaging is particulatly intended for packaging, storing and
microwave heating of food and it is adapted to this
particular use.A packaging according to the invention is defined by claim 1. It is obtained by folding a
flat sheet, one side of which, which is to be the inside of
the packaging, has a barrier material layer. The barrier
material is chosen depending upon the liquid which shall be
packed and can be e.g. a polymer
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Liquid tight sealed packaging obtained by folding a flat
sheet, which on one surface being the inner wall of the

packaging, has a layer of barrier material, said packaging
comprising a bottom (1), long (4, 5) and short sides (2, 3),

a lid part (10) extending from a respective long side (4),
corner parts (12, 13) integral with the respective long and

short sides and folded outwards onto the short sides (2, 3)
and downfolded flaps (15) extending from the short sides and

comprising borders (18) along the upper edges of the
respective short sides, which borders cover the upper parts

of the corner parts, 
characterized in
 that

the packaging includes a lower lid part (6) and an upper lid
part (10) extending from the respective long sides (4, 5),

the downfolded flaps (15) overlap the corner parts,
the lower lid part (6) can be split by means of a perforation
(9) into an inner part (7) and a surrounding border (8),
the packaging is liquid sealed thereby that said outer border
(8) of the lower lid part is glued to the upper borders (18)

of the short sides and against the inside of the opposing
longer side (4),
and the upper lid part (10) is glued to the inner part (7) of
the lower lid part such that when the upper lid part is

opened, the inner part of the lower lid follows the upper lid
part and is torn away from the outer border (8) along the

perforation (9).
