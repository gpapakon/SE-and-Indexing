<ABSTRACT>
At least two code tables are used to decode a variable 
word length code sequence. A first code table (41) stores code 

information of variable word length codes having code lengths 
shorter than or equal to 8 bits. In addresses of the first code table (41) 

corresponding to longer variable word length code than 8 bits, data 
is stored indicative of longer codes than 8 bits. At first, the first 

code table is accessed. If the data being read from the first code 
table (41) indicates a code length not more than 8 bits, an input variable 

word length code is identified and decoded. If the data being read 
from the first code table indicates a code length longer than 8 bits, 

the second code table (42) is accessed and the input variable word 
length code is identified and decoded.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a variable word length code
decoding method and apparatus for decoding an input variable
word length code sequence, and more particularly relates to a
decoding method which decodes the input variable word length
code sequence quickly by using relatively small capacity code
tables.As is well known in the art, an amount of data to be
transmitted or to be stored can be reduced by using a variable word
length coding technique. In this technique, a variable word length
code set is determined based on a generation probability
distribution of symbols to be outputted from an information source.
More specifically, shorter length codes are assigned to symbols with
higher generation probabilities while longer length codes are
assigned to symbols with lower generation probabilities. Thus, the
amount of data can be reduced. Three conventional methods are known for decoding the
input variable word length code sequence.The first conventional method uses a single code table
which stores a binary code tree representing a variable word length
code set. In the method, a variable word length code which
coincides with a part of the input variable word length code
sequence is searched by tracing the binary code tree on a bit-by-bit
basis.The second conventional method uses another type of
code table which stores bit patterns of variable word length codes
and the corresponding decoded values. In that method, each
variable word length code stored in the code table is compared with
the input variable word length code sequence on a code-by-code
basis.The third conventional method uses still another type of
code table having addresses that represent data associated with bit
patterns of variable word length codes and which stores a decoded
value and a code length in the corresponding address. In that table,
the required number of address bits corresponds to the maximum
code length in a variable word length code set. The third
conventional method is described, for example, in U.S. patent
4,509,038.However, the conventional methods have the following
disadvantages. The first conventional method requires a long
decoding time because the method performs bit-by-bit operations.
The second conventional method also requires a long decoding time 
because each code in the table is compared code-by-code with the
input sequence. The third method, on the other hand, requires a
huge capacity memory though the method requires a short decoding
time.It is therefore a principal object of the invention to
provide a variable
