<CLAIMS>
A process for the preparation of 2-H-heptafluoropropane from
hexafluoropropene, characterized in that hexafluoropropene is

reacted with hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a weakly basic
ion exchanger whose reactive centers comprise tertiary amino

groups.
The process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that
hexafluoropropene and HF are used in a molar ratio of 0.9:1 to

1.1:1.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the reaction is carried out at a temperature of 20 to 120°C.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the reaction is carried out at a temperature of 30 to 90°C.
The process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that
the reaction is carried out at a temperature of 50 to 70°C.
