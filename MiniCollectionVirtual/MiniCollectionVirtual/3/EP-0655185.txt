<ABSTRACT>
Method for controlling in position and in load a tool coupled to a tractor (1), on the basis of a position reference datum and of a percentage load reference datum formulated by the operator, characterised in that:   - the position error dEp and the instantaneous load error dEd are compared by a subtractor (35) which calculates the datum: ES = dEp - dEd, - the mean load encountered by the tractor (1) is measured automatically over a reference period beginning as soon as the tool reaches its reference position, and - at the end of this period the signals for raising or for lowering the tool are automatically formulated, these aiming to compensate for the instantaneous load error dEd with respect to the mean load measured with a positional displacement or error of dEp.

A position and force control method for an implement coupled to a tractor, on
the basis of a position reference Ep and a force percentage reference set by the

operator, characterised in that:

the average force FM encountered by the tractor is measured automatically over a
reference period that starts as soon as the implement has reached its reference

position,
the position error dEp with respect to Ep and the instantaneous force error dEd

equivalent to the difference between the measured tractive force FT and the average
force encountered are compared by a subtractor (35) which processes the

relationship: 
ES = dEp - dEd
,
at the end of this period, raising or lowering signals for the implement are
automatically processed in order to minimise ES by compensating the instantaneous

force dEd with respect to the average force measured by a position displacement dEp.
A force and position control method as claimed in claim 1, characterised in
that the force error signal dEd is obtained by multiplying the result of the comparison

between the average force value measured and the instantaneous force by a gain
value MX accessible by the user.
A force and position control method as claimed in claims 1 or 2, characterised
in that the result of the comparison 
ES = dEp - dEd
 is subject to proportional integral
processing whose result, assimilated with a total error signal ET, is processed in

order to generate pulse signals controlling the raising or lowering of the implement.
A force and position control method as claimed in one of claims 1, 2 or 3,
characterised in that the operator can interrupt the movement of the implement by

replacing the position reference value CPOS by a real position of the implement
POS, in order to cancel out the error signal dEp, and by forcing the error value dEd to

zero.
A force and position control method as claimed in one of the preceding
claims, characterised in that the operator may impose a top position reference for the

implement. 
A position and error control device for the implementation of a method as
claimed in claim 1, comprising at least one position sensor (9) for the coupling arms

(2) of the tractor (1) and a force sensor (11) connected to a lifting control housing
(10) comprising means for comparing the position error dEp and the instantaneous

force error dEd by means of a subtractor (35) which processes the relationship: 
ES = dEp - dEd
,
this datum ES automatically being minimised by moving the implement,

means for the automatic measurement of the average force encountered by the tractor
over a reference period that starts as soon as the implement has reached its reference

position, means for calculating the instantaneous force error dEd which is the
difference between the tractive force measured FT and the average effort encountered

FM and means for automatically establishing, at the end of this period, signals for
raising or lowering the implement adapted to offset the instantaneous force error dEd

by an error or position displacement dEp, this housing (10) comprising a multiple-position
switch (13) making it possible, for the operator in particular, to trigger the

force and position control, and to impose the immobilisation of the implement in its
position or its displacement up to a top limit position.
A force and position control device as claimed in claim 6, characterised in
that the control housing (10) comprises regulation means (14, 14', 15, 15'), making it

possible to impose a position reference and a force percentage reference modifying
the gain MX in the position control.
A force and position control device as claimed in claim 5, 6 or 7,
characterised in that it comprises a microprocessor (7) comprising at least one

comparator (35) of the position error signal dEp and force error signal dEd measured
and an integrator (34) making it possible to establish the total error signal ET to be

minimised.
A force and position control device as claimed in claim 8, characterised in
that the microprocessor (7) comprises a digital filter (29) whose band can be

switched, the first frequency band of which is used to acquire the average value of
the tractive force and the second band of which is used to filter the measurement of

the force detected. 
A force and position control device as claimed in claims 8 or 9, characterised
in that the position and force sensors (9, 11) and the switch (13) are connected to the

microprocessor (7) by means of a multiplexer (21) and an analog-digital converter
(22).
A force and position control device as claimed in claims 5 to 10,
characterised in that the position and force control adjustments are carried out by

means of contact buttons (14, 14', 15, 15') disposed on the control housing (10).
