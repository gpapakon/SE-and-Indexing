<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a component by moulding, this component including an internal cavity (5), being in the form of an insert (3) produced in a first thermoplastic (2) covered, at least partially, by a layer of a second, covering thermoplastic (6). According to the invention, a backpressure is provided in the internal cavity (5) when the insert is still malleable during the step of putting the covering material (6) in place. The subject of the invention is also an application of this method to the manufacture of components, such as, in particular, vehicle door handles.

Process for manufacturing parts by moulding, the said parts comprising an 
inner cavity (5) taking the form of a insert (3) produced in a first thermoplastic material 

(2) covered at least partially by a layer of a second, covering plastic material (6), in 
which compression is provided in the internal cavity (5) during the covering material 

placing stage, characterized by the fact that : 

use is made of a first thermoplastic material (2) having mechanical stress 
resisting properties ; 
at least one bubble (4) of pressurized gas is injected into the said first material 
(2) with a view to delimiting a hollow inner cavity (5) ; 
a counter-pressure exerted through the injection of a pressurized gas is 
provided, the insert (3) being still malleable during the covering material placing stage. 
Process for manufacturing a part by moulding according to claim 1, 
characterized in that : 


the said first material (2) is introduced into a first impression (1a) ; 
the pressurized gas is injected into the said first material (2) with a view to 
delimiting the said inner cavity (5) ; 
the insert (3) is placed in a second impression (1b) and, after the said first 
material has partially congealed, the pressurized gas is injected into the said cavity (5) 

and the said first material is covered, at least partially, by a layer of covering material 
(6) ; 
the whole is cooled down and the formed part is released from the mould. 
Process for manufacturing a part by moulding according to claim 1, 
characterized in that use is made of materials (2, 6) of the same chemical family to 

facilite recycling. 
Process for manufacturing a part by moulding according to claim 1, 
characterized in that use is made of a covering material (6) which comprises adjuvants 

such as inflating agents. 
Process for manufacturing a part by moulding according to claim 2, 
characterized in that provision is made for producing an insert (3) with a first material 

(2) inside the first impression (1a) followed by injecting a second material (6) intended 
to form the « skin » (7) to cover the insert (3) placed in the second impression (1b). 
Manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized in that use is 
made of a first material (2) formed by a polyolefin material.  

 
Manufacturing process according to claim 1, characterized in that use is 
made of a second material (6) formed by a thermoplastic polyolefin material. 
Application of the part manufacturing process according to claim 1 to the 
manufacture of handles (8), in particular for the doors of vehicles.
