<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a filter and more 
particularly to a filter comprising partially fused particles. A suitable particulate material can be partially fused 
by means of a high energy input to give a structure containing 
a multitude of interstices. When heated above their 
crystalline melting point, the particles do not fluidise, but 
adopt a viscoelastic form. The external shape of the 
individual particles is substantially retained so as to 
provide an array of contiguously dispersed neighbouring 
particles. Usually for the successful partial fusion of 
polymers ultra high molecular weight materials (UHMW) must be 
used, a typical molecular weight being 3 to 9 x 10⁶ g/mol. 
However, some materials such as polyurethane and thermoplastic 
polyurethane do not need to possess an ultra high molecular 
weight for successful particle fusion. According to the present invention there is provided a 
filter comprising partially fused particles. The particles are preferably polymeric, although other 
materials such as metals may be used. For example, the partially fused particles may be 
provided as a coating on a base material such as a fabric. 
This coating may be partially fused in situ. Alternatively 
the partially fused particles are not provided as a coating, 
but in sheet form, optionally comprising a reinforcement 
structure embedded within the sheet. The partially fused polymer exhibits toughness, abrasion 
resistance, chemical resistance, heat stability, low  
 
coefficient of friction, an easy-clean surface and 
hydrophobicity. Preferred polymers for partial particle fusion include 
polyalkenes such as polyethylene and polypropylene, 
polyurethane, thermoplastic polyurethane or EPDM (ethylene 
propylene diene monomer). One example polymer is the Hostalon 
GUR (trade mark of Hoechst AG) range of UHMW polyethylene 
having a molecular weight of 3.2 to 8 x 10⁶ g/mol. Another 
example is the Goodrich product 58810 (TM) which has a shore 
hardness of 90. A sheet of partially fused polymer may be prepared by 
evenly spreading the polymer powder into a layer of uniform 
thickness of typically 3 to 4 mm and then heating the polymer. 
The uniform polymer layer may be obtained by using a roller 
or blade. Alternatively the polymer powder may be moulded to 
the desired thickness. The layer of polymer is heated to say 
230°C to 240°C for a time period in the order of 1.9 mins per 
mm of sheet thickness, allowing for shrinkage due to partial 
fusion forces. Continuous sheet production may involve 
distr
