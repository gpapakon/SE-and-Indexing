<ABSTRACT>
First adjustment screws (11) for adjusting the optical 
axis are disposed near vent pipes (15) of a head lamp device (1) 

for a motor vehicle, and guard ribs (18) which separate the 
first adjustment screws (11) and the vent pipes (15) from each 

other project from a housing (2). While the head lamp (1) is 
being aimed, the vent pipes (15) are prevented from being 

damaged or dismounted in error by a screwdriver. As a 
result, adjustment screws (11) may be very short even though 

they are close to the vent pipes (15), allowing the space 
behind the head lamp device to be utilized effectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a head lamp
device for a motor vehicle.A two-bulb head lamp device for a motor vehicle is
set forth in the present inventor's co-pending Japanese
Laid-open Patent publication No. 5-85435. The proposed
head lamp device comprises two bulbs and a pair of
reflecting mirrors which are accommodated in one
housing. Water vapor in the housing is evaporated by
the heat of the bulbs and tends to be attached to the
inner surface of a lens, thereby frosting the lens.
Head lamp devices designed to solve this problem have
an opening defined in the housing for discharging heat
and water vapor out of the housing. See US-A-5 207 497.A head lamp device for a motor vehicle as
disclosed in Figure 3 of Japanese Laid-open Utility
Model publication No. 4-135105 has a J-shaped vent pipe
(460) disposed on the back of a housing for discharging 
heat or the like. The optical axis can be adjusted
vertically by rotating an optical axis adjusting
mechanism 5A shown in Figure 3. Generally, head lamp
devices have an optical axis adjusting mechanism.
See DE-A-3 327 789.
An
optical axis adjustment will hereinafter be referred to
as "aiming" and an optical axis adjusting mechanism as
the "aiming mechanism."An aiming rod or aiming bolt, corresponding to the
component 50A in Figure 3 of Japanese Laid-open Utility
Model Publication No. 4-135105, is considerably long.
If the aiming rod was short, then a tool for turning
the aiming rod would interfere with the J-shaped vent
pipe, and would damage or dismount the J-shaped vent
pipe when operated in error. Therefore, the aiming rod
is of a sufficient length. The long aiming rod,
however, requires a space behind the head lamp, and
such a space is not preferable from the standpoint of
positioning devices in a compact arrangement.It is an object of the present invention to
provide a technical arrangement for shortening the
aiming rod of a head lamp device.To achieve the above object, a head lamp device
for a motor vehicle according to the present invention
has
the features indicated in Claim 1, for instance
an aiming mechanism for adjusting the optical axis
disposed near a vent pipe, and a guard rib projecting
from a housing and separating the aiming mechanism and
the vent pipe from each other.The reflector has a plurality of reflector
surfaces having a plurality of types of reflecting
angles, and a lens, disposed in front of the reflector,
is substantially transparent. The guard rib has a height which might be substantially
the same as the height at which the vent

A head lamp device for a motor vehicle, comprising:

a housing (2) for accommodating a bulb (8, 9) and a
reflector (3, 4);
a vent hole (2a) defined in said housing (2) for
venting vapors disposed within said housing (2);
a vent pipe (14, 15) comprising an L-shaped portion
having a first leg communicating with said vent hole

(2a) and extending substantially horizontally away
from said housing and a second leg communicating with

atmosphere extending downwardly;
an aiming mechanism (11) for adjusting the optical
axis of said reflector (3, 4);

characterized in that

said aiming mechanism (11) is located above said vent pipe
(14, 15) and that a guard rib (18) located between said

aiming mechanism (11) and said vent pipe (14, 15) is
provided on said housing (2) wherein said guard rib (18)

projects to a distance (H1) away from said housing (2)
which is greater than a distance at which a tool end of

said aiming mechanism (11) is located from said housing.
The head lamp device for a motor vehicle according to claim
1, wherein said vent pipe extends a distance (H2) away from

said housing which is substantially equal to said distance
(H1) said guard rib (18) extends away from said housing

(2). 
The head lamp device for a motor vehicle according to claim
1 or 2, wherein said reflector (3, 4) has a plurality of

reflector surfaces having a plurality of types of
reflecting angles, and a substantially transparent lens (6)

being disposed in front of the reflector (3, 4).
The head lamp device for a motor vehicle according to one
of claims 1 to 3, wherein said aiming mechanism (11, 12,

13) includes a plurality of adjustment screws operatively
connected to said housing (2) and said reflector (3, 4) for

enabling manual adjustment of said reflector (3, 4)
relative to said housing (2).
The head lamp device for a motor vehicle according to one
of claims 1 to 4, wherein a plurality of vent holes (2a)

and vent pipes (14, 15, 16) connected to said vent holes
(2a) are operatively provided for venting vapors disposed

within said housing (2).
The head lamp device for a motor vehicle according to one
of claims 1 to 5, wherein said guard rib (18, 25) and said

vent pipe (14, 15, 16) are disposed on an exterior surface
of said housing (2) and project a greater predetermined

distance therefrom relative to a distance said aiming
mechanism (11, 12, 13) extends from said housing (2) to
