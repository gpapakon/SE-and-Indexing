<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for preforming and gluing cardboard boxes. More precisely, it relates to the part of the apparatus which makes it possible to produce the "struts". To this end, the apparatus comprises a first piece (60) which can pivot through 90 degrees about the axis XX' and a second piece (64) which can pivot about the axis YY' of the piece (60) which permits folding of the part (54) of the piece of cardboard relative to the piece (52) of the latter. Then the pivoting of the piece (60) permits folding of the part (52) of the piece of cardboard with respect to the rest (34) of the piece.
