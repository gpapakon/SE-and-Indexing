<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to 
a process for the production of 
ethylene/propylene copolymer 
rubbers (EPRs), which include ethylene/propylene copolymers 
(EPMs) and ethylene/propylene/ethylidene norbornene terpolymers 
(EPDMs), generally having a crystalline content of less than 
15 percent by weight. The EPRs are elastomeric copolymers and terpolymers 
used in such applications as hose and tubing, wire and cable, 
gaskets, and single ply roofing. They are usually formulated with 
fillers, oils, processing aids, and stabilizing agents, and cured by 
reacting the polymers with sulfur in the presence of accelerators or 
with a combination of sulfur and an organic peroxide such as 
dicumyl peroxide. These polymers are presently manufactured commercially 
in solution and slurry processes with soluble vanadium catalysts. 
These processes are very expensive to run, requiring solvent 
removal and steam stripping steps. In addition, these solution 
catalysts do not provide satisfactory particle morphology in a 
fluidized bed. Improvement in these processes would be desirable 
and, particularly, the development of a gas phase process to 
produce these same products would be more economically attractive 
because little post-reaction cost will be incurred, and particle 
morphology would, expectedly, be improved. One of the catalysts selected to produce the EPRs in the gas 
phase is described in United States patent 4,508,842. Typically, 
the catalyst is comprised of a catalyst precursor, which is the 
reaction product of vanadium trichloride and an electron donor, the 
precursor being reacted with an aluminum containing modifier, and 
impregnated into a silica support; a promoter such as chloroform; 
and a triisobutylaluminum cocatalyst. This catalyst does achieve  
 
good particle morphology, but poor overall product, e.g., EPRs made 
with this catalyst exhibit poor cure and contain much high 
temperature crystallinity. This is believed to be the result of poorly 
distributed propylene, and, in the case of the EPDMs, poorly 
distributed diene. Adjustments with respect to the cocatalyst and 
the promoter were found to improve the propylene distribution and 
lower the high temperature crystallinity, but only a marginal 
improvement in the cure was achieved. An object of this invention, therefore, is to provide a process 
for the production of EPRs having a high cure performance. Other 
objects and advantages will become apparent hereinafter. According to the present invention, the above object is met 
by a process for
