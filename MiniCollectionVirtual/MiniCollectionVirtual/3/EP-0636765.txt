<ABSTRACT>
Turbo machine including a single-piece rotor (26) which has to be ventilated by gas at some other temperature. The ventilation system, adjacent to the flow stream (5) of the propulsion gases is sufficiently separated from this stream, without a material seal, if the ventilation duct (7) is divided into an internal main duct (21) and an external duct (22) in which the ventilation gas is accelerated in order to form an entrainment jacket which the gas in the other duct can not get through. Application to aircraft engines.

<CLAIMS>
Turbomachine comprising a combustion chamber (1) 
upstream of a turbine (6) consisting in part of a single-piece 

rotor element (26) fitted with blades, comprising 
a passage (17, 21, 22) for the communication and blowing 

of gas from the combustion chamber towards a peripheral 
region (18) of the rotor, adjacent to the blades, the 

passage being divided, in front of the region adjacent to 
the blades, into an inner passage (21) and an outer 

passage (22) surrounding the inner passage (21), characterized 
in that most of the gas passes through the inner 

passage (21) and in that the outer passage (22) is 
narrowed in order to accelerate the rest of the gas and 

prevent the gas which has passed through the inner 
passage from dispersing outwards. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the turbine is separated from the combustion 

chamber by a distributor structure (8) comprising a ring 
(9), facing the peripheral region (18) of the rotor and 

through which the communication passage passes. 
Turbomachine according to either one of Claims 1 
and 2, characterized in that the inner passage is fitted 

with a spin-inducing device (23) for giving the gas a 
circular speed. 
Turbomachine according to Claim 3, characterized 
in that the peripheral region (18) is formed with a 

hollow (25) opened by orifices (24) situated in front of 
the inner passage (21).  

 
Turbomachine according to Claim 4, characterized 
in that the hollow (25) communicates via drillings (30) 

with cavities (31) of the blades (32) of the rotor.
