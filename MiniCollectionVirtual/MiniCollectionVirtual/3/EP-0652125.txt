<ABSTRACT>
The sun visor has a sun visor element (1), a lighting device (6), an L-shaped bearing shaft (2) and a bearing block (5). The bearing shaft (2) is supported in the bearing block (5) with a shaft leg (3) and in the sun visor element (1) with the other shaft leg (4). With the exception of an end region (16) supported in the sun visor element (1), the shaft leg (4) is constructed as a housing (18) which is equipped with the lighting device (6). The sun visor element (1) has on one longitudinal edge (9) a step-shaped shoulder (10) as a free space (12) for the housing (18). The bearing hole in the sun visor element (1) for the end region (16) starts from the end wall of the step-shaped shoulder (10).
