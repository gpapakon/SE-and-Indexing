<ABSTRACT>
A mobile communication 
method in which in 

order to call a receiver from 
a base station, a calling signal 

including information on 
the identification number of 

the receiver to be called is 
transmitted n times. The 

position of the calling signal 
transmitted for the second 

and later times is determined 
in accordance with 

the predetermined rules for 
the position of the same calling 

signal transmitted for the 
first time. For the part of the 

signal whose reception without 
any error is confirmed, 

the receiver suspends the receiving 
operation at the timing 

of the same signal part of 
the same calling signal to be 

received repeatedly. Thus 
the battery saving is implemented 

with a higher efficiency.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is utilized for the paging of mobile units in a mobile radio
communication system. It relates in particular to technology for reducing the time that
power is being consumed by the batteries of a mobile unit ― in other words, to
battery saving ― and it is particularly suited to being utilized in selective radio paging
systems.In a mobile radio communication system that uses portable mobile units, it is
essential for at least those functions in the mobile unit which operate in response to
a call to be kept constantly operational, so that a mobile unit can be paged at any time.
However, because mobiles are portable, the capacity of the batteries can be increased
only so far, and battery saving has therefore been practised for some time. This
battery saving will now be explained for the example of a selective radio paging
system.A selective radio paging system employs radio waves to selectively call a
moving individual. A subscriber who intends to receive this service will always carry
a pager. This pager operates on a built-in battery, and the pager circuits must be
constantly powered while the subscriber is out and about, so that he or she can always
be called. Battery saving has therefore been practised for some time in order to make
batteries of limited capacity last as long as possible.A conventionally used battery saving method will be explained with reference
to Fig.1 and Fig.2. Fig.1 shows a conventional signal format, and Fig.2 shows the
operation of conventional battery saving. As shown in Fig.1, the signal transmitted
from a base station consists of signals of period T=jt which comprise j frames of
signal length t connected together. Each frame comprises a frame synchronization
signal and a plurality of paging signals of arbitrary length for selectively calling pagers
which have been set to receive this frame. The paging signals comprise an address
signal and, connected to this, message signals. The address signal is constituted by
adding check bits to address information bits, and the message signals are constituted
by adding check bits to message information bits. The smallest unit including added
check bits is called a "code word". In the example depicted in Fig.1, the address
signal and the message signals each constitute a single code word. It is also feasible
for the address signal and the message signals each to comprise a plurality of code
words. The pagers are divided into j groups, and pagers that belong to group p
(1 ≤p ≤j) perform battery saving by carrying out
