<DESCRIPTION>
Concerns about the environmental impact of fluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons
on the environment call for expanded uses of environmentally sound refrigerants,
such as water or ammonia. For commercial chiller applications in the capacity
range of 15-10,000 refrigeration tons with little heating requirements, water is
usually the preferred refrigerant due to its non-flammable and benign nature.Aqueous absorption fluid cycles taking advantage of such refrigerants have
been known and used for many decades. Single effect and various two-stage
designs are commercially used in many countries. However, the increasing
concern about the overall CO2 generation in the process of converting fossil fuels
into energy used for air conditioning or refrigeration calls for higher energy
conversion efficiencies than currently obtained with single stage (COP = 0.6 to 0.8)
or two-stage (COP = 0.9 to 1.25) absorption equipment.U.S. Patent No. 4,732,008 teaches the use of two single stage cycles
coupled to achieve three refrigeration effects. The independent loops carry different
absorption fluids with the lower stage using fluids such as aqueous LiBr solutions.
However, the needed upper stage fluid crystallisation and vapour pressure
suppression properties require the use of a different fluid. Performance estimates
lead to COPs of 1.5 to 1.7 if suitable upper stage fluids are used.We acknowledge that US-A-4,551,991 discloses a triple-effect absorption
cycle refrigerator with three generators containing aqueous absorption fluid and
operating at successively higher temperatures; a condenser for vapour-phase
refrigerant; an absorber communicating with the generators; and an evaporator
communicating with the absorber. Also, US-A-3,742,728 discloses the combination
of a multiple generator with either one or four absorbers.The present invention is apparatus as defined in Claim 1.Such apparatus can have three refrigeration effects in which either a single
aqueous absorption fluid or two or three different absorbents or different absorbent
concentrations with a single refrigerant, i.e. water, are used throughout the system.
Thus, because such a single refrigerant, water, is used as the refrigerant or working
fluid solvent throughout the system, regardless of the stage, the invention offers a
substantial improvement over prior art triple effect systems which rely solely on heat 
transfer coupling of three heat exchangers with no common mass flows. The
apparatus and systems of the invention can result in COPs similar to those used
