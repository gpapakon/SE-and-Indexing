a signal having the same frequency according to a 

time-division includes a local oscillator for generating 
a local signal having a first frequency, a frequency 

converter for converting the local signal into a 
carrier signal, a modulator for modulating the carrier 

signal by using a transmitting baseband signal so as to 
generate a transmitting signal having a second frequency 

and a receiving section for receiving a receiving 
signal having the second frequency which is the same as 

that of the transmitting signal. The frequency convertor 
includes a fractional frequency convertor for 

converting a signal having an input frequency into a 
signal having an output frequency. Wherein, the output 

frequency is n₂/n₁ times the input frequency, where n₁ 
is an integer greater than 2, n₂ is an integer greater 

than 1, n₁ and n₂ being relatively prime, whereby the 
second frequency of the transmitting signal is not any 

integral multiple of the first frequency of the local 
signal. In receiving operation of the transceiver, the 

operation of the frequency convertor is terminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a time
division duplex transceiver for alternately transmitting
and receiving a signal having the same frequency.In conventional two-way radio communication
systems, such as portable telephones, frequency division
duplex (FDD) is often used. According to FDD, the
radio communication system transmits a signal having a
first frequency and receives a signal having a second
frequency which is different from the first frequency.
However, in recent years, since time-division multiplexing
can be easily achieved with respect to a digital
signal, time division duplex (TDD) has attracted
considerable attention. According to TDD, the radio
communication system alternately transmits and receives
a signal having the same frequency. Compared with FDD,
TDD is advantageous, for example, in that it is easy to
allocate a frequency to each of a transmitting signal
and receiving signal, and that transmitting and receiving
efficiencies can be made substantially equal.In a time division duplex transceiver, a
transmitting frequency is identical with a receiving
frequency. When a signal having the transmitting
frequency is generated within the transceiver during
the receiving operation of the transceiver, the signal
is likely to enter the receiving section of the transceiver.
This interferes with the receiving operation
of the transceiver and deteriorates the receiving 
performance. Thus, during the receiving operation of
the transceiver, it is necessary to completely terminate
the generation of the signal having the transmitting
frequency.Furthermore, in cases where the transceiver
is of a superheterodyne configuration and uses a local
signal for frequency conversion in both of the transmitting
and receiving sections of the transceiver, a
transmitting intermediate frequency is identical with a
receiving intermediate frequency. Thus, the above-described
problem of deterioration in the receiving
performance also arises when a signal having the transmitting
intermediate frequency is generated during the
receiving operation of the transceiver. In such a
transceiver, therefore, it is necessary to completely
terminate the generation of the signal having the
transmitting intermediate frequency.The generation of the transmitting signal can
be prevented by terminating the operation of a transmitting
local oscillator during the receiving operation
of the transceiver. However, it is practically impossible
to terminate the operation of the transmitting
local oscillator during the receiving operation of
