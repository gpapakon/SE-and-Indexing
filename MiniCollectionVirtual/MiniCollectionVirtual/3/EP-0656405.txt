<ABSTRACT>
An aqueous stripping composition comprising a mixture of 
about 55% to 70% by weight of monoethanolamine, about 22.5 to 15% 

by weight of hydroxylamine and water. The stripping composition 
is effective to strip photoresists, residues from plasma process 

generated organic, metal-organic materials, inorganic salts, 
oxides, hydroxides or complexes in combination with or exclusive 

of organic photoresist films at low temperatures without 
redepositing any substantial amount of metal ions.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous stripping compositions
particularly useful for stripping paints, varnishes, enamels,
photoresists and the like, from various substrates. More
particularly, the invention relates to aqueous stripping
compositions comprising monoethanolamine and hydroxylamine.Stripping compositions used for removing coatings from
substrates have for the most part been highly flammable
compositions, compositions generally hazardous to both humans and
the environment and compositions which are reactive solvent
mixtures evidencing an undesirable degree of toxicity. Moreover,
these stripping compositions are not only toxic but their
disposal is costly since they must be disposed of as a hazardous
waste. In addition, these stripping compositions generally have
severely limited bath life and, for the most part, are not
recyclable or reusable.Generally, compositions containing chlorinated hydrocarbons
and/or phenolic compounds or other highly caustic and corrosive
materials have been employed as stripping compositions for
stripping paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, photoresists,
powder coatings and the like, from substrates such as wood, metal
or silicon wafers. Hot caustic compositions are generally
employed to remove coatings from metals and methylene chloride
compositions to remove coatings from wood. In many cases, the
components of the stripping compositions are relatively toxic 
reactive solvent mixtures and thus must be subject to stringent
use conditions and require hazardous chemical handling procedures
and wearing of safety garments and apparel by users so as to
avoid contact with the stripping compositions.Additionally, because many of the toxic components of such
stripping compositions are highly volatile and subject to unduly
high evaporation rates, the stripping compositions require
special human and environmental safety precautions to be taken
during storage and use of said compositions.U.S. Patent No. 4,276,186 to Bakos et al discloses a
cleaning composition which includes N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and
an alkanolamine. However, in a comparative study, applicant has
found that the use of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone does not provide a
broad spectrum of cleaning as is capable with the composition of
the invention.U.S. Patent No. 4,617,251 to Sizensky discloses a stripping
composition which is prepared with a select amine and an organic
polar solvent. The composition is formed utilizing from about
2 to about 98% by weight of amine compound and about 98 to about
2% of an organic polar
