<ABSTRACT>
Compounds having proteolytic inhibitory activity useful for treating diseases, particularly as applied to the treatment of sepsis, AIDS or autoimmune diseases, resulting from a decrease in the circulating level of mature protein hormones derived from the proteolytic cleavage of prohormone precursors such as 26 kD TNF, and methods for identifying compounds having the desired inhibitory activity are provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
 COMPOSITIONS FOR THE INHIBITION OF PROTEIN HORMONE FORMATION AND USES THEREOFThis is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Serial No. 07/395,253, filed August 16, 1989, which is pending.Field of the Invention This invention is in the area of immunology/biochemistry, and particularly concerns the development of compositions and methods for identifying inhibitors of protein hormone release, and prophylactic and therapeutic uses of the inhibitors for treating diseases associated with elevated levels of the hormones. More specifically, the invention facilitates the identification of compositions and methods for identifying inhibitors of a TNF convertase. These inhibitors may be used to treat a variety of diseases, particularly sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, cachexia, AIDS and autoimmune diseases, and thus affords the physician alternate treatment regimes.Background of the InventionIn the United States alone nosocomial bacteremia develops in about 194,000 patients per year, and of these about 75,000 die. Maki, D.G., 1981, Nosocomial Infect.. (Dikson, R.E., Ed.), page 183, Yrke Medical Books, U.S.A.. Most of these deaths are attributable to six major gram-negative bacilli — Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Serratia. The current treatment for bacteremia is the administration of antibiotics which, have limited effectiveness in treatment of septic shock. The precise pathology of bacteremia is not completely elucidated. Nevertheless, it is known that certain bacterial endotoxins called lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are the primary causative agent. LPS consists of at least three significant antigenic regions: lipid A; core polysaccharide; and O-specific polysaccharide. The latter is also referred to as O-specific chain or simply O-antigen. The O-specific chain region is a long-chain polysaccharide built up from repeating polysaccharide units.The number of polysaccharide units differs among different bacterial species and 

may vary from one to as many as six or seven monosaccharide units. While the O-specific chain varies among different gram-negative bacteria, the lipid A and core polysaccharides are similar if not identical.Since LPS plays a key role in sepsis, many approaches have been pursued to neutralize its activity. Presently, there is considerable work which suggest that antiLPS antibody will soon be a valuable clinical adjunct to the standard antibiotic therapy.LPS initiates a cascade of biochemical events that eventually causes the death of the patient. It is widely

WE CLAIM:
1. A method for identifying a prophylactic or therapeutic of a disease caused by a mature tumor necrosis factor (TNF) produced from a proTNF by cleavage of said proTNF by a TNF convertase, the method comprising the steps of:
(a) contacting the proTNF with an amount of the TNF convertase effective for cleaving the proTNF;
(b) measuring the conversion of the proTNF to the mature TNF in step (a);
(c) repeating steps (a) and (b) further including a molecule sought to be identified as a prophylactic or therapeutic of diseases caused by the mature TNF;
(d) measuring the conversion of the proTNF to the mature TNF in step (c); and
(e) comparing the conversion measured in step (b) with the conversion measured in step (c) to determine whether the molecule is a suitable prophylactic or therapeutic of diseases caused by mature TNF.
2. The method of claim 1, wherein the proTNF is 26 kD TNF.
3. The method of claim 1, wherein the disease is selected from the group consisting of sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, cachexia, cerebral malaria, AIDS, and graftversus-host disease.
4. The method of claim 3, wherein the disease is sepsis.
5. The method of claim 1, wherein the TNF convertase is proteinase-3 (PR-3).
6. The method of claim 5, wherein the PR-3 is native PR-3.
7. The method of claim 5, wherein the PR-3 is recombinant PR-3. 


8. The method of claim 1, wherein the conversion of proTNF to mature TNF in steps (b) and (d) is approximated by a colorimetric assay measuring TNF convertase cleavage of a colorimetric TNF convertase substrate.
