<ABSTRACT>
In a measuring device for two forces extending at right angles to each other and in a horizontal plane, having a carrier and a measuring plate moving relative thereto under the influence of the forces, said measuring plate being connected rigidly to the carrier via connecting elements extending symmetrically to each other, the connecting elements extend laterally, with respect to the respective force component, from the measuring plate and are constructed as cruciform rods, which consist of two plate-shaped part rods rotated with respect to each other by 90 DEG  along their axis extending in the direction of the respective force component.

<CLAIMS>
A device for measuring two forces extending perpendicularly to one another
and in a horizontal plane, comprising a support (2) and a measuring plate (1)

movable relative to the support when influenced by the forces, the plate being
rigidly connected to the support (2) via crossbars (5
1
-5
8
) which extend
symmetrically relatively to one another and comprise two plate-shaped component

bars at an angle of 90Â° relative to one another about their axis extending in the
direction of the respective component of force, characterised in that the measuring

plate (1) is disposed over the support (2) and has extensions (4
1
 - 4
4
) projecting
thereunder engaged by respective ends of the crossbars (5
1
 - 5
8
), the other ends
of the crossbars (5
1
 - 5
8
) being connected to the corner points of the support (2),
so that the crossbars (5
1
 - 5
8
) extend substantially horizontally at the sides of the
measuring plate (1) and of the support (2).
A measuring device according to claim 1, characterised in that each pair of
crossbars (5
1
, 5
2
; 5
3
, 5
4
; 5
5
, 5
6
; 5
7
, 5
8
) are symmetrically disposed relative to the
extensions (4
1
 - 4
4
).
A measuring device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that in order
to determine each horizontal component of force, crossbars disposed parallel to

one another are provided along their axial length with pick-ups (17 - 32; 33 - 39)
disposed on both sides of each component bar, and the measuring signals from

corresponding pick-ups are added.
