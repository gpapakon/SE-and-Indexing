A phthalocyanine dye of the formula (1)


where

H
2
Pc
is the radical of the phthalocyanine;
M
is hydrogen or an alkali metal;
B
is a radical of the formula (2a) or (2b)

 
where


R
3
is hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
or alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
R
4
is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon
atoms, or alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms,
M
is as defined above,
m
is zero or 1, and
n
is zero, 1 or 2;
Y
is vinyl or is an ethyl group which, in the
β-position, contains a substituent which is

eliminable by alkali to leave a vinyl group;
a
is from zero to 3, and
c
is from 1 to 4,

the sum of (a+c) being from 1 to 4.
A phthalocyanine dye as claimed in claim 1, wherein
B is a radical of the formula (2a) where R
3
 is
hydrogen, methyl or methoxy, R
4
 is hydrogen or
methoxy, and m is zero.
A phthalocyanine dye as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein a is from zero to 3 and c is from 1 to 2.
A phthalocyanine dye as claimed in at least one of
claims 1 to 3, wherein Y is β-sulfatoethyl or vinyl.
A process for preparing a phthalocyanine dye of the
formula (1) of claim 1, which comprises reacting a

phthalocyaninesulfonyl chloride of the formula (3)


where H
2
Pc and M are each as defined in claim 1, p
is from zero to 3, and q is from 1 to 4, the sum of

(p+q) being from 1 to 4, in an aqueous or nonaqueous
medium with an amine of the formula (4) 


H
2
N-B-SO
2
-Y

where B and Y are each as defined in claim 1, with
concurrent or successive partial hydrolysis of the

sulfonyl chloride groups to sulfo groups, and
optionally in the case of Y being β-dihydroxyethyl

converting the β-hydroxyethylsulfonyl group into a
group of the formula -SO
2
-Y where Y is an ethyl
group substituted in the β-position by an ester

group.
The use of a phthalocyanine dye of at least one of
claims 1 to 4 or of a phthalocyanine dye prepared as

claimed in claim 5 for dyeing hydroxyl- and/or
carboxamido-containing material, in particular fiber

material.
A process for dyeing hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing
material, preferably fiber material, by

bringing a dye onto or into the material and fixing
the dye on or in the material by means of heat or

with the aid of an alkaline agent or by both
measures, which comprises using in the process a dye

that is a phthalocyanine dye of at least one of
claims 1 to 4 or a phthalocyanine dye prepared as

claimed in claim 5.
