<ABSTRACT>
A process for inhibiting the re-absorption of migrating dyes in 
the wash liquor comprises introducing into a wash liquor containing 

a peroxide-containing detergent, from 0.5 to 150 mg, per litre of 
wash liquor, of one or more manganese complexes. The manganese compounds 

do not exhaust at all on to cotton, polyamide or polyester fibres so 

that the compounds cannot lead to fibre discolouration problems.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for inhibiting the re-absorption of migrating
dyes in the wash liquor.It is well known that various metal compounds, e.g. manganese complexes, are useful in
detergents as catalysts for peroxides.It has now been found that certain other manganese complexes, although effecting no
apparent improvement in the bleaching power of peroxides, exert a pronounced bleaching
effect on dirt or dyes in the wash bath. Moreover, these manganese complexes do not
exhaust at all on to cotton, polyamide or polyester fibres so that the complexes cannot lead
to fibre discolouration problems.Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for inhibiting the re-absorption of
migrating dyes in the wash liquor, comprising introducing into a wash liquor containing a
peroxide-containing detergent, from 0.5 to 150, preferably from 1.5 to 75, especially from
7.5 to 40 mg, per litre of wash liquor, of one or more compounds having the formula (1),
(2), (3), (4), (5), (6) or (7):

or

in which R1, R2, R3 and R4 are the same or different and each is hydrogen or optionally
substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl; R5 is hydrogen, alkyl or SO3M; R6 and R7 are the
same or different and each is NH-CO-NH2, a group of formula 

or a group of formula
Y is optionally substituted alkylene or cyclohexylene; X is OH, NH2, optionally
substituted aryl or optionally substituted alkyl; n is 0, 1, 2 or 3; M is hydrogen, an alkali
metal atom, ammonium or a cation formed from an amine; m is 0 or 1; and A is an anion.When one or more of R1, R2, R3 , R4, R5 and X are optionally substituted alkyl, preferred
alkyl groups are C1-C8-, especially C1-C4-alkyl groups. The alkyl groups may be branched
or unbranched and may be optionally substituted, e.g. by halogen such as fluorine,
chlorine or bromine, by C1-C4-alkoxy such as methoxy or ethoxy, by phenyl or carboxyl,
by C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl such as acetyl, or by a mono- or di-alkylated amino group.When one or more of R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are cycloalkyl, this may also be substituted,
e.g. by C1-C4-alkyl or C1-C4-alkoxy.When one or more of R1, R2, R3 , R4, R5 and X are optionally substituted aryl, they are
preferably a phenyl or naphthyl group which may be substituted by C1-C4-alkyl, e.g. by
methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec.-butyl or tert.-butyl, by C1-C4-alkoxy
such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, sec.-butoxy or
tert.-butoxy, by halogen such as fluorine, chlorine or bromine, by C2-C5-alkanoylamino,
such as acetylamino,
