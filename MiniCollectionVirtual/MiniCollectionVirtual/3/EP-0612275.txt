<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of improving the fatigue life of holes and cut-out portions formed in material sheet wherein on at least one area on the sheet where a hole is to be formed or a hole for the cut-out portion is to be formed, the sheet is compressed, and most preferably forming indentations from said compression, on at least one side, and preferably two sides of the material sheet. The process is generally applicable, but is particularly useful where the sheet is to be used in high fatigue loading and stress conditions, such as aircrafts. The invention also provides for an apparatus for improving the fatigue resistance of holes and cut-out portions in material.

<DESCRIPTION>
 IMPROVING FATIGUE LIFE OF HOLESThe invention is in relation to a method of improving the fatigue life of holes and areas which are to be cut out and in particular holes and cut-out portions in structures which are subjected to fatigue loading for example aerospace and aircraft applications. The present invention also provides an apparatus for improving the fatigue life of holes and cut out areas.In the production of aircraft, in order to fasten metal sheets together, holes are made to house the fastening means, such as rivets or bolts. However, holes are a source of localised weakness in the metal sheet or plate which* can lead to failure of the particular sheet or plate due to the formation and propagation of cracks from the hole.It is generally known that the fatigue life of a sheet or plate having a hole therethrough can be increased by generating compressive stresses within the sheet about the hole. There have been numerous ways of creating compressive stresses around a hole, one of the most common being cold-working or cold- expanding the hole using a split sleeve. In this method a hole is formed first which is large enough to receive a split tubular sleeve, but which is undersized in respect of the rivet or bolt. The split tubular sleeve which can be axially or helically split, is placed into the hole. An expansion section of the cold-working mandrel is drawn through the inside of the split tubular sleeve thus expanding the tubular sleeve and also the hole. After the expansion section of the mandrel has passed through the pre-split tubular sleeve, the tubular sleeve may be removed. The expanded tubular sleeve cannot be reused and is discarded after forming one hole. Due to the high manufacturing tolerances required for the production of such sleeves, their unit cost is high, and in cases where a large number is required (as in the case of a typical aircraft), the process becomes extremely costly to implement. Costs aside, there are further physical problems with the cold-working method. Whilst the cold-working method provides the desirable compressive stress around the hole, the compressive stress is not evenly distributed because of the split in the sleeve. The presence of the split in the sleeve also creates a sharp discontinuity on the side of the hole which itself can become a source of stress concentration. To overcome this problem, it is 

 generally recommended that a suitable reaming process be applied to the hole following cold expansion. This additional procedure further adds to the

THE CLAIMS DEFINING THE INVENTION ARE AS FOLLOWS:
1. A method for improving the fatigue resistance of holes and cut-out portions formed in material sheets wherein at least one area on at least one sheet where a hole is to be formed or a hole for the cut-out portion is to be formed is compressed on at least one side prior to the formation of the hole.
2. The method of Claim 1 , wherein the at least one sheet is compressed on both sides of the sheet.
3. The method of Claims 1 or 2, wherein an indentation is formed as a result of the compression.
4. The method of Claim 3, wherein the cross-section of the indentation has the same size cross-section as the hole to be made.
5. The method of any one of Claims 1 to 4, wherein a means for compressing is utilised to compress the at least one sheet and also form the hole to be made.
6. The method of any one of Claims 1 to 5, wherein the at least one sheet is constrained in a restraining means.
