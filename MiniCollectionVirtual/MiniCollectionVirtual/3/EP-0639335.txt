<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a drink with an acidic
pH based on an aqueous mixture of a vegetable extract,
juice or infusion and milk products.Drinks based on the components listed above are desirable
for their refreshing characteristics due to their mineral
salt content resulting from the vegetable component and
for their nutritional content provided by the milk
proteins.The production of such drinks, particularly on an
industrial scale, however, is obstructed by problems
inherent in the physical stability of mixtures of such
components.Database WPI, Week 8510, Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB,
AN 85-058049 discloses an acidic milky drink. Database WPI, Week 8311,
Derwent Publications Ltd., London, GB, AN 83-96304k discloses an acidic drink.In order to provide a drink including the components
listed above which is chemically and physically stable,
the present invention provides a drink which is
characterised in that it includes a) pectin, b) a
polyol alginate, and c) at least one ester of a fatty
acid selected from the group consisting of lauric,
myristic, palmitic, caprylic and capric acids and
mixtures of esters of the said fatty acids.The drink which is the subject of the present invention
has an acidic pH generally less than 5 and preferably 
between 3 and 4.5.As the aqueous component of vegetable origin there may be
used infusions of aromatic plants, particularly infusions
of tea, Java jute, dog-rose and/or extracts or juices of
fruits such as, for example, strawberries, raspberries,
bilberries, cherries, apples, pineapples, pears, peaches
and the like.The milk derivative is typically constituted by milk,
preferably skimmed (fat content of less than 0.3%) cream
or yoghurt. In the preferred embodiment, the drink
includes milk proteins and milk enzymes resulting from
the addition of yoghurt as such to the drink, or milk
proteins derived from the use of milk, preferably
skimmed, and milk enzymes added in a suitable manner to
cause the lactic fermentation of the drink, as will be
described more fully below.The use of the milk component, in addition to providing
milk proteins, generally in quantities not higher than
3.5% by weight and preferably in quantities not higher
than 2% by weight, also adds lipids to the drink, in
concentrations generally not higher than 3.6% by weight,
preferably not higher than 2% by weight.The drink further includes carbohydrates selected from
the group consisting of sucrose, dextrose, fructose, 
invert sugar, sorbitol and their mixtures. The calorific
value of the
