<ABSTRACT>
The air meter forming part of the air intake 
passage of the engine is equipped with an electronic 

circuit for measuring the rate of intake air and a 
memory for storing data pertaining to actual air flow 

rate versus output characteristics of the air meter or 
correction data for calculation of air flow rate. The 

engine control unit digitally calculates actual air flow 
rate to be used for determination of the amount of fuel 

to be supplied from a signal output from the air meter 
with reference to the air flow rate versus output 

characteristics of the air meter or air flow correction 
data fetched from the memory provided on the air meter 

body.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an engine control
equipment
according to the preamble of claim 1.In an electronic engine control equipment for
automobiles, the rate of fuel supplied to the engine (or
the duration of a fuel injection pulse) is calculated by
an engine control unit (microcomputer) having a function
of inputting a signal indicating the rate of air flowing
through an intake passage measured by the air meter, a
signal representing the rate of revolutions of the
engine, a coolant temperature signal, etc. and
performing a digital operation on these signals. There
have been various types of air meters for this type of
engine control system. One of the most widely-used air
meters uses a principle of a thermal air flow meter such
as exothermic resistance elements whose resistance is
dependent upon temperature as they are very small and
can directly measure the mass and flow rate of air.A conventional engine control equipment stores the
standard air flow rate versus output characteristics
table in advance in the engine control unit which works 
as the core of the engine control equipment and
calculates the rate of intake air from a signal output
from the air meter with reference to said table.To calculate the rate of intake air using said
table, a means is required which matches the actual air
flow rate versus output characteristics of the air meter
with a preset standard air flow rate versus output
characteristics table (hereinafter mentioned as standard
characteristics table) since each air meter product has
specific output versus flow rate characteristics. It is
well known that a typical one of such means consists of
flowing air of a preset rate through two known different
points and adjusting the amplification factor and the
differential voltage of the differential amplifier
provided on the output side of the air meter so that the
outputs at these two points of the air meter may have
the expected values (two points in the standard
characteristics).However, as the air flow versus output relation is
not linear, it is technically hard to adjust said
relation correctly. When you adjust the amplification
factor and the differential voltage at one point to
match two output signals with the expected values, the
values on the other point may go off the expected
values. To make this deviation smaller, you must repeat
the above steps. Therefore, this adjustment is very
time-consuming. Accordingly, presentation of a drastic
adjusting method is expected. When considered with the above description, a new
