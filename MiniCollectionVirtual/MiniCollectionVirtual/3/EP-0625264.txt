<ABSTRACT>
The proposal is for a heater arrangement for a measuring probe to determine components in gases, especially internal combustion engine exhaust gases. The heater arrangement consists of at least two at least partially superimposed heating elements (10, 11) electrically insulated from each other by at least one insulating layer. From one heating element (10) to the other (11) a contact (14) through the insulating layer is arranged in such a way that the heating elements (10, 11) are connected in series one behind the other.

Heater arrangement for a measuring sensor for
determining constituents in gases, in particular in

exhaust gases from internal combustion engines, having at
least two heating elements which are arranged at least

partly one above the other each with a heating conductor
track and with heater connecting tracks, the heating

elements being electrically insulated from one another by
at least one insulating layer, characterized in that a

first and a second heater connecting track (30, 31) are
provided which are arranged in different layer planes

separated from one another by the insulating layer, in
that the first heater connecting track (30) is connected

to a first heating conductor track (20) and the second
heater connecting track (31) is connected to a further

heating conductor track (21), and in that a connection
(14, 15, 16, 17) routed through the insulating layer is

provided from one heating conductor track (20) to the
other heating conductor track (21) in such a way that the

heating conductor tracks (20, 21) are connected in series
one behind the other.
Heater arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized
in that more than two heating elements (10, 11,

12, 13) are provided, of which the two outer heating
elements (10, 11) each have a heating conductor track

(20, 21) and a heater connecting track (30, 31), in that
the inner heating element(s) (12, 13) has (have) a

heating conductor track (22, 23), and in that the ends of
the individual heating conductor tracks (20, 21, 22, 23)

are each connected by means of connections (15, 16, 17). 
Heater arrangement according to one of the
preceding claims, characterized in that the heating

elements (10, 11, 12, 13) are layer-type resistance
heaters.
Heater arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized
in that the heating conductor tracks (20, 21, 22,

23) are routed in meander and/or zigzag fashion over the
large face of the insulating layers.
Heater arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized
in that the heating conductor tracks (20, 21, 22,

23) each have an inner and an outer heating conductor
track segment, referred to the plane of the insulating

layer, the inner heating conductor track segment being of
wider construction than the correspondingly outer heating

conductor track segment.
