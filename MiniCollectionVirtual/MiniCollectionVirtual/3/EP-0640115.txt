<ABSTRACT>
Gel compositions comprising styrene-(ethylene/propylene)-styrene (SEPS) block copolymer having Mw of at least 180,000 and polystyrene content of 25-45 weight percent, and at least 300 parts by weight percent, and at least 300 parts by weight of extender liquid per 100 parts by weight of the block copolymer. The extender softens the ethylene/propylene mid-blocks of the copolymer and the resulting gels have unexpectedly higher tack, temperature resistance, and extender-retaining ability than corresponding gels made with styrene-(ethylene/butylene)-styrene block copolymers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides new and technically superior gel
compositions comprising a styrene-(ethylene/propylene)-styrene
(SEPS) block copolymer and at least 300 parts by weight (preferably at
least 400 parts by weight, more preferably at least 500 parts by
weight) of extender liquid per 100 parts by weight of the block
copolymer, which liquid extends and softens the ethylene/propylene
polymer blocks of the said copolymer. These proportions of extender
can alternatively be expressed as percentages by weight of the
copolymer, thus: 300=25%, 400=20%, 500=17%.Known gels made from styrene-(ethylene/butylene)-styrene
(SEBS) block copolymers, and test methods for defining and
characterising gels, are described in WO-A-8800603 and WO-A-9005166.Gels according to the present invention are given in claim 1. They are made of SEPS
copolymer having weight average molecular weight Mw of at least
180,000, preferably at least 200,000, more preferably at least
220,000, and polystyrene content of 25-45 weight percent, preferably
28-40 weight percent, more preferably 29 to 36 weight percent, and
made with substantially non-aromatic extender liquid, tend to have
improved high-temperature performance and improved ability to
retain the extender liquid when subjected to pressure in various end
uses. The SEPS gels of this invention also tend to have higher tack
than the known SEBS gels, thus reducing the need for added
tackifiers to achieve a desired level of adhesion to surfaces with which
they are in contact in end use.The SEPS gels are preferably soft, high-temperature-slump-resistant,
springy gel compositions, by which is meant liquid-extended
polymer compositions having an ultimate elongation (measured by 
ASTM D412 modified as described below) greater than 100%, with
substantially elastic deformation (i.e. substantially no hysteresis) to
an elongation of at least 100%; ultimate tensile strength (ASTM D412)
less than 1 MegaPascal; dynamic storage modulus (as hereinafter
described) less than 50000 Pascals; and substantially zero slump at
temperatures up to 100°C, preferably up to 120°C, more preferably up
to 135°C, and especially up to 150°C.The invention for some end purposes is more particularly
concerned with such gel compositions comprising from 4% to 20% by
weight of the SEPS copolymer and at least 500 parts by weight of
extender liquid per 100 parts by weight of the polymer, in which the
SEPS copolymer comprises more than 50%, preferably more than
75%, more preferably more than 90%, and especially more than 95%,
