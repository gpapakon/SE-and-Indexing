for a housing in a composite insulator has a structure 
in which the housing is formed around the outer 

periphery of an insulating supporting member inside a 
mold through vulcanization by heating at high temperature 

under high pressure, wherein the electrically 
insulating material comprises an electrically insulating 

component and a thermal expansion coefficient-regulating 
material added in such an amount as to give a coefficient 

of linear thermal expansion of the electrically 
insulating material not more than 1.5 x 10⁻⁴/°C.

housing made of said electrically insulating material 

around a core. Further, a process for producing such a 
composite insulator is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrically insulating material to be used in composite
insulators, to a process for the production of composite
insulators by using such an electrically insulating
material for housing thereof, and to composite
insulators using such an electrically insulating
material as housing thereof.Recently, demands have been increasing for the
composite insulators. In general, the composite
insulator, which is also called "polymer insulator", has
the structure in which a housing made of an electrically
insulating material such as EPDM rubber is provided
around the outer periphery of a rod-shaped insulating
supporting member made of, for example, a fiber-reinforced
plastics (FRP).Into rubber compounds as electrically insulating
material for housings has been conventionally 
incorporated silica, alumina, titania, calcium
carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, or aluminum hydroxide as
a reinforcement or a filler. Among them, hydrates such
as magnesium hydroxide or aluminum hydroxide is useful,
because such hydrates can enhance tracking resistance
and erosion resistance of the insulator. Particularly,
since a temperature at which aluminum hydroxide releases
water of crystallization is as low as about 20°C,
aluminum hydroxide is the most appropriate as the
additive for the electrically insulating rubber
materials for the housing of the insulator.In order to form a housing around the outer
periphery of an insulating supporting member, an
injection molding process, a transfer molding process,
or a compression molding process is employed. In these
processes, a unvulcanized resin or a unvulcanized rubber
composition is charged into a two-split type mold, and
the housing is formed by curing this electrically
insulating material in the mold.Figs. 2 and 3(a) and 3(b) are sectional views
for schematically illustrating an electrically insulating
supporting member 12 and a housing 13 around the
supporting member.First, the electrically insulating supporting
member 12 is placed in a central portion of the mold
constituted by split mold units 11a and 11b. Then, as 
shown in Fig. 2, an electrically insulating material is
injected into the mold around the supporting member 12
under pressure by means of an injection unit not shown.
At that time, the mold units 11a and 11b are firmly
tightened, and pressure and heat are applied to the mold
units 11a and 11b from the outer side of the mold. The
reason why the pressure is applied to the mold units 11a
and 11b from the outside is that the molding units 11a
