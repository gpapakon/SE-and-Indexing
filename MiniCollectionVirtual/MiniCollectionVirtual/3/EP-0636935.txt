<ABSTRACT>
A process for the continuous preparation of 
solutions of water-immiscible or water-insoluble 

organic compounds in substantially non-aqueous organic 
solvents characterised in that a compound to be 

dissolved is introduced into a first section of a twin 
screw extruder and passes along the extruder interior 

in the direction of flow to a second section of the 
extruder into which an organic solvent is introduced 

to form the required solution, the temperature in the 
extruder interior being maintained at appropriate 

levels along its length.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the
continuous preparation of solutions of organic
compounds in organic solvents and in particular to a
process for the continuous preparation of colour
forming coupler solutions for use in the photographic
industry.Colour forming coupler solutions for use in the
photographic industry are solutions of complex organic
compounds such as 2-[4'-(4-benzyloxy-phenylsulphonyl)
phenoxy]-N-2'-chloro-5'- [4'-(2,5-di-tert amylphenoxy)
butyramido] phenyl -2- pivaloyl acetamide in solvents
such as 1:1 mixtures of di-N-butyl phthalate and 2(-2
butoxy ethoxy) ethyl acetate. At present these
solutions are made by a batch process in which the
solution is prepared in an open vessel generally known
as a kettle. This process is lengthy, typically taking
up to 40 minutes to make the coupler solution, and
during this lengthy period there is a marked tendency
for degradation to occur in the solution. Moreover,
since the solution is formed in an open vessel, it is
in contact with the air and there is also a tendency
for oxidation to occur in the solution. Additionally
the volume of the kettle is generally such that there
is significant wastage of material in the event that
the process is interrupted or ceased for any reason.US Patent No 4,379,836, published 12 April 1983
describes a process for the production of photographic
emulsions consisting of water-immiscible or water-insoluble
organic substances and an aqueous solution of
an organic binder, characterised in that the
hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases involved are heated
separately, each to its particular temperature above 
its liquefaction point, and then continuously dosed into
a dispersing chamber. The specification of this patent
discloses in Example 2 the supply of solid, pulverulent
couplers into a solution shaft (single shaft extruder)
which is at the same time supplied with tricresyl
phosphate heated to 120° C so that a solution is
continuously formed. In this instance heat is supplied by
hot solvent rather than by use of e.g. heating jackets.US Patent No. 4,608,210 describes a method of
manufacturing plastically bonded propulsive powders
and explosives using a twin screw extruder where
optionally solvent may be added downstream of the
polymer. The temperature is required to be maintained
at low levels for safety reasons and hence friction
has to be substantially eliminated.According to the present invention we provide a
process for the continuous preparation of solutions of
water-immiscible or water-insoluble organic
