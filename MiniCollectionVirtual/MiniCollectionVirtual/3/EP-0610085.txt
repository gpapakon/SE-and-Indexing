<ABSTRACT>
A conveyor has a drive wheel 64 which is driven from a 
driveshaft 10 and which moves into and out of driving engagement. 
In the preferred embodiment, there is a drive gear 20 
mounted on the drive shaft 10, and the drive gear 20 drives a 

drive wheel 64, which is mounted on a drive wheel mounting frame 
38 that pivots about the axis of the drive shaft 10, so that the 

drive wheel 64 is constantly driven from the driveshaft and 
pivots into and out of driving engagement with the conveyor 

roller 14.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to conveyors driven by a
drive shaft extending along the conveyor.The primary type of driveshaft-driven conveyor used in
the industry uses O-rings, which wrap around spools mounted
on the drive shaft and around the conveyor rollers in order
to drive the rollers as the drive shaft rotates. This type
of conveyor has a speed limitation, because the O-rings may
begin to slip at high speeds. It also is difficult to replace
the O-rings when they break. It is also very difficult to
stop portions of the O-ring driven conveyor for accumulation.
Such an arrangement is shown in GB 2018213.Some conveyors are known which use a drive shaft and
drive by a means other than O-rings. For example, it is known
to put a gear on the driveshaft and a gear on the conveyor
roller and have a direct drive from the driveshaft to the
roller. This arrangement cannot be put into the accumulation
mode, because, whenever the driveshaft is rotating, all the
conveyor rollers are rotating.WO-A-92 04261 discloses a roller conveyor having a
line drive shaft and a driven wheel which is connected to the
drive shaft through a drive arrangement consisting of a drive
wheel having a conical drive surface which is pressed into
frictional engagement with a conical surface of an
intermediate wheel having an axis normal to the axis of the
drive shaft to transmit the drive to the drive wheel. This
arrangement has proved to have disadvantages caused by low
durability and excessive temperature build-up load capacity,
which limits its speed and load carrying capacity. The
present invention seeks to overcome these problems by
providing a system having higher speed and load capabilities.Chain-driven roller conveyors are known, but they also
have speed limitations, can be very noisy, and require
substantial maintenance. Chain-driven conveyors are not
readily reversible in direction, because a chain must always 
be pulled, not pushed.According to the present invention there is provided a
conveyor comprising a conveyor frame, a drive shaft extending
along said conveyor , at least one drive wheel supported by a mounting
frame for driving a load along the conveyor, characterised in
that the drive wheel is in direct permanent driving engagement
with the drive shaft, and said drive wheel is pivotable about
the axis of the drive shaft between a first, load driving,
position and a second, load non-driving, position.In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the conveyor
has a plurality of rollers rotatably mounted on said conveyor

<CLAIMS>
A conveyor comprising a conveyor frame (12), a drive
shaft (10) extending along said conveyor, at least one drive wheel (64)

supported by a mounting frame (38) for driving a load along
the conveyor, characterised in that

the drive wheel (64) is in direct permanent driving engagement
with the drive shaft (10), and said drive wheel (64) is

pivotable about the axis of the drive shaft (10) between a
first, load driving, position and a second, load non-driving,

position.
A conveyor according to claim 1, having a plurality of
rollers (14) rotatably mounted on said conveyor frame (12) and

forming a load supporting surface, said rollers each having
an axis of rotation, characterised in that

in said first position the drive wheel (64) is in driving
contact with at least one of the rollers (14) and a second

position in which the drive wheel (64) is out of driving
contact with said roller so that when said drive wheel (64)

is in said driving contact power is transmitted from said
drive shaft (10) through said drive wheel (64) to said at

least one roller (14), the axis of rotation of said drive
wheel (64) being substantially parallel to the axis of

rotation of said at least one roller (14).
A conveyor according to claim 1, characterised in that
the load is supported on a load supporting surface, said drive

wheel (64), when in said first position, being in direct
driving contact with the load, and lifts the load clear of the

supporting surface to thereby drive the load along the
conveyor. 
A conveyor according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that said means for driving said drive wheel

(64) from said drive shaft (10) includes a drive gear (20)
mounted on said drive shaft (10) and a driven gear (62)

mounted on said drive wheel mounting frame (38) and meshed
with said drive gear (20), such that, when said drive wheel

mounting frame (38) moves said drive wheel (64) into an out
of driving contact with the load or the at least one roller

(14), said drive gear (20) and driven gear (62) remain
continuously meshed.
A conveyor according to Claim 4, characterised in that
said driven gear (62) and said drive wheel (64) are mounted

for rotation about the same axis, such that rotation of said
driven gear (62) causes rotation of said drive wheel (64).
A conveyor according to any one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that said drive wheel mounting frame (38) is

pivotably supported on a bracket (26) mounted to said conveyor
frame (12).
A conveyor according to any one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that said drive wheel (64) is rotatable about

an axis which is substantially perpendicular to the axis of
the drive shaft (10) and said drive wheel mounting frame (38)

is movable relative to said conveyor frame (12), such that,
when said mounting frame (38) is moved upwards, said drive

wheel (64) is in driving contact with the load or the at least
one roller (14) and when said mounting frame (38) is moved

downwards, said drive wheel (64) is out of said driving
contact with the load or the at least one roller (14). 
A conveyor according to any one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the conveyor further includes an

actuator (74) for causing said drive wheel (64) to move into
and out of driving contact with the load or the at least one

roller (14).
