<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a novel design of a vibratory conveyor for building elements (144), with an element (143) forming the conveying stage and with a vibrating system consisting essentially of a first vibrating element (145, 142), which is part of a useful mass and to which is fastened the element (142) forming the conveying stage, and of a second vibrating element (155) which is part of a counter-vibrating mass, with at least one drive (164), acting between the two vibrating elements (145, 155), for generating a vibratory movement, and with spring arrangements (148), to which the first vibrating element (145) and the second vibrating element (155) are connected for an oppositely directly vibrating or vibratory movement, which has a movement component in a conveying direction (141) of the conveying stage (143), by means of a base element (161) or carrier, by which the vibrating system can be fastened to a machine frame (162).

Vibratory screw conveyor for construction elements (144), with an oscillatory system 
for pots (140), which in each case form, on their inner surface, a helix-like 

transportation track (143) around a vertical pot middle axis (TM) of the pot (140) for 
the construction elements; with the oscillatory system having a first oscillation 

element (145) which forms a useful mass and has the pot (140), a second 
oscillation element (155) which forms a counter oscillatory mass, as well as spring 

arrangements (149, 150), with which the first and second oscillation elements (145; 
155, 155') are connected with a base element or carrier (159) with which the 

oscillatory system can be fixed onto a machine frame (162); with the oscillatory 
system furthermore having a drive (164) acting between the two oscillation elements 

(145, 155), this drive creating a counterwise, oscillating rotary vibration movement of 
the oscillation elements around the vertical pot middle axis (TM), with this rotary 

vibration movement having, in the case of the first oscillation element (145), a 
movement component in a conveyor direction of the transportation track (143) of the 

pot (140) and with the spring arrangements (148, 149, 174, 175) with their spring 
constants being adjustable to the mass moments of inertia of the useful mass and 

of the counter oscillatory mass in such a way that a natural frequency results in 
each case for the first oscillation element (145) and the second oscillation element 

(155) this being the same or approximately the same as the frequency of the drive, 
characterised by the fact that for specified pots (140) of varying mass, and with 

adjustment of only those spring arrangements (149, 175) assigned to the useful 
mass, the mass moment of inertia of the counter oscillatory mass is equal to that 

mass moment of inertia which the useful mass shows when the pot (140) with the 
greatest mass is used. 
Screw conveyor system in accordance with claim 1, characterised by the fact that 
the spring arrangements (175) of at least the useful mass have leaf springs, and 

that when the pot (140) with the greatest mass is used, the leaf springs of the useful 
load forms, in each case, a leaf spring assembly (149, 175) with numerous leaf 

springs.  
 
Screw conveyor system in accordance with one of the claims 1 or 2, characterised 
by the fact that the second oscillation element is a ring (155) which encloses the 

middle axis (TM) or the first oscillation element (145). 
Screw conveyor system in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised 
by the fact that the first oscillation element is a retaining plate (145), on which is 

fixed the element (140) which has the transportation track (143). 
Screw conveyor system in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised 
by the fact that, distributed around the middle axis (TM) at equal angular distances, 

at least three spring arrangements (148) are provided, which in each case have at 
least two spring elements (149, 150), with the spring elements preferably being leaf 

springs or leaf spring assemblies, and/or that at least two drives (164) are provided, 
evenly distributed around the middle axis. 
Screw conveyor system in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 5, characterised 
by the fact that the drive (164) consists in each case of a magnet core (166) which 

has a magnetic coil (165), and a magneto inductor (167), and that the elements of 
each drive (164) are fixed in such a way to the first oscillation element (145) as well 

as to the second oscillation element (155) that a magnetic gap (168) remains 
between the magnet core (166) and the magneto inductor (167), with, preferably, 

the magnet core carrying the magnet coil (165) being fixed to the second oscillation 
element (155), and the magneto inductor (167) being fixed to the first oscillation 

element (145). 
Screw conveyor system in accordance with claim 6, characterised by the fact that 
the magnetic gap (168) of each drive (164) is arranged in a plane which lies parallel 

or approximately parallel to the middle axis (TM), but which lies at a distance from 
this middle axis. 
Screw conveyor system in accordance with one of the claims 1 to 7, characterised 
by the fact that in the case of at least three spring arrangements (148), evenly 

distributed around the middle axis (TM), provided between two such spring 
arrangements (148) there is, in each case, one drive (164), as well as an area 

equipped with an adjustable auxiliary mass (170).

extension radial to this middle axis, and that fixed at the end of each arm (160) are 

the spring elements (149, 150), with, preferably, in each case one drive (164) being 
provided adjacent to an arm (160) and that the magnet gap (168) of each drive 

(164) is located in a plane parallel to the longitudinal extension of the adjacent arm 

(160) in each case.
