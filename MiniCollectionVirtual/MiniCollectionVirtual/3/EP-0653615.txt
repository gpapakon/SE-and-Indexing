<ABSTRACT>
Valve block assembly for measuring pressures and pressure differences in liquid or gas transporting pipes, consisting of a measurement converter (2) with measuring cell (3) and electronic part (4) and a valve block (9) which is connected to the measurement converter (2), is provided with connecting bores for a process fluid (liquid or gas) and with securing bores, and is arranged together with the measurement converter in a protective box (1) whose wall has apertures (10) for connecting lines leading into the valve block and to which the valve block in the interior of the protective box is connected via its connecting bores, the valve block being provided with at least one pair of valves (11a, b) for blocking off the process lines entering into it and exiting from it. This valve block assembly is intended to be designed such that it is significantly more capable of adaptation, from the point of view of its mounted condition and the manner of its use, than the conventional assemblies of this type. This is achieved in that the connecting bores and the securing bores, by means of which the valve block (9) can be secured to the wall (14) of the protective box (1), are arranged such that the valve block, irrespective of the number of connecting bores and of whether a liquid or a gas is used as the process fluid, can be connected to apertures (10) always having the same position in the protective box wall (14).

Valve block assembly for the measurement of pressures and pressure differences in
pipelines transporting liquids or gases, comprising a measuring transducer (2) having a

measuring device (3) and an electronic part (4) and a valve block (9) connected thereto and
provided with connecting bore holes (17, 18) for a processing fluid (liquid or gas) as well as

with fixing bore holes (21, 23), which valve block is arranged together with the measuring
transducer within a protective box (1) the walls thereof are provided with apertures (10) for

connecting tubes leading into the valve block and joint within the protective block to the
valve block through its connecting bore holes (17, 18), the construction being such that the

valve block is provided with at least one pair of valves (11a, b; 12a, b) for cutting off the
processing pipes entering and leaving the valve block, 
characterized in that
 the connecting
bore holes (17, 18) as well as the fixing bore holes (21, 23) by which the valve block (9) is

attached to the wall (14) ofthe protective box (1) are arranged such that the valve block can
be connected independently from the number of the connecting bore holes as well as

whether as processing fluid a liquid or a gas is used, with apertures (10) having always the
same position in the wall (14) ofthe protective box.
Valve block assembly according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the wall (14) of the
protective box (1) is reinforced by a plate profile (16) in the attachment area of the valve
