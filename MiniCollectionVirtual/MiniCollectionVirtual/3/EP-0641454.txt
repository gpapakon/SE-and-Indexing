<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an optical filter for the
absorption of electromagnetic radiation. More
particularly it relates to an optical filter for the
absorption of electromagnetic radiation having a
wavelength in the region of 532 x 10-9m whilst allowing
transmission of the remaining electromagnetic radiation.In certain circumstances it is desirable to absorb
electromagnetic radiation in a narrow wavelength band by
means of an optical filter whilst allowing transmission of
a substantial portion of the incident radiation, i.e. that
at other wavelengths. In situations where laser
radiation i.e. coherent radiation of a defined wavelength,
is employed, such as certain medical and industrial
applications, the beam of radiation may contact the eye or
other device and cause damage thereto. In these
situations absorption of electromagnetic radiation over
the narrow wavelength band corresponding to the wavelength
of the radiation emitted by the laser is necessary to
protect the eye or optical device. Conventionally this
has been achieved by way of an optical filter which whilst
absorbing the narrow wavelength band corresponding to the
wavelength of the laser, transmits the substantial portion
of the incident radiation i.e. that at other
wavelengths. Such optical filters are commonly
manufactured by incorporating a compound which has
particular absorption characteristics into a suitable host
material, for example a polymeric matrix such as
polycarbonate.US Patent No. 4622174 discloses a transparent
protective laser shield comprising a transparent host
material and having at least one chromophore incorporated
therein. The or each chromophore is selected from a
porphyrin complex which has been modified by a metal, so
providing metallo porphyrin complexes in the transparent 
material which absorb optical radiation of a pre-determined
narrow wavelength band located within a selected broad
wavelength band passed by the transparent host material.
In particular, platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) is
disclosed as being particularly suitable for absorption of
neodymium YAG - doubled laser radiation at 532 x 10-9m.
Although PtOEP absorbs strongly at 532 x 10-9m, its
properties of photostability are very poor and unsuitable
for a number of applications.US Patent No 4657345 discloses a similar shield in
which the absorbers are diffused into a host material
adjacent to its surface rather than being disseminated
uniformly through it.UK Patent Application No 2225445 discloses a similar
type of optical filter in which platinum
