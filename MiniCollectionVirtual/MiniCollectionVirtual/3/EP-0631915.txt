<ABSTRACT>
A retarder control system (100) utilises a 
spool valve means (110) having a spool valve member 

(115) axially translatable between an on- and an 
off-position. A spring means (131) is employed to 

bias the spool valve member toward its off-position. 
A torque converter (101), a cooler (102) and a 

retarder (145) each have an input means (153,161,143) 
and a discharge means (156,149,163) that are ported 

through the spool valve means. The retarder is 
selectively ported to a hydraulic return means (168) 

through the spool valve means, and a modulating 
solenoid (104) is employed to feed pressurised 

hydraulic fluid against the spool valve member not 
only to move the spool valve member against the spring 

means toward its on-position but also to regulate the 
axial translation of the spool valve member in order 

to control the pressure at the retarder discharge 
means that is also ported through the spool valve 

means.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a retarder
control system for a vehicular transmission system.Retarders are hydrodynamic brakes that
utilise relative rotation of the components within the
retarder to assist in slowing the vehicle in which the
retarder is employed. Retarders are sometimes located
in association with the output of the transmission and
sometimes they are located in conjunction with the
input to the transmission. Both locations have
relative advantages and disadvantages, as is well
known to this art. The present invention, however, is
directed to the control by which the retarder is
actuated, or deactuated, and a control embodying the
concepts of the present invention is not dependent
upon the relationship of the retarder to the
transmission input or output.Retarders have historically been employed in
large vehicles to assist in vehicle braking, or
deceleration, particularly for the descent of steep
hills in order to relieve the vehicle brakes from
extended usage. The original retarders, or as they
were then known, grade-retarding devices, were
activated by moving the drive range selector lever to
a "grade retarder range." In this position of the
selector lever all drive clutches were released, and
to the surprise of the uninitiated driver, the grade
retarder position of the selector lever would not
afford any forward drive to the vehicle. It was truly
a retard-only position.Over the years the application and control
of the retarder became quite sophisticated. The
current state of the art for retarder controls is
depicted in the accompanying Figure 1 to provide for
an on/off operation of the retarder. The retarder 
itself typically constitutes a bladed rotor wheel that
is attached to the transmission, and a bladed stator
that is fixedly positioned. In the vehicular art when
a component is thus fixedly positioned it is said to
be "grounded," or "fixed to ground." The rotor and
the stator form a toroidal working chamber that is
filled with hydraulic fluid to effect the hydrodynamic
braking action, and from which the hydraulic fluid is
emptied in order to deactuate the retarder.The prior art retarder control system,
designated generally by the numeral 10 in Figure 1,
requires multiple valves to satisfy all the current
requirements for such devices. For example, line
pressure is supplied from a pump 11 through a conduit
12 to a regulating valve 13 that is operated by the
control pressure supplied by a modulating control
valve or solenoid 14 through a conduit 15 to the
regulating valve 13. When

<CLAIMS>
A retarder control system (100) comprising a spool valve
means (110) having a spool valve member (115) axially translatable between

an on- and an off-position; spring means (131) to bias the spool valve member
toward the off-position; a converter (101), a cooler (102) and a retarder (145),

each having an input means (153,161,143) and a discharge means
(156,149,163) ported through the spool valve means; characterised by


a hydraulic return means (168) selectively ported to the retarder
through the spool valve means; a modulating solenoid (104) to feed

pressurised hydraulic fluid against the spool valve member to move the spool
valve member against the spring means toward said on-position and to

selectively connect the retarder out pressure (163) via passages (191,190) in
the valve means (110) to assist the spring means or via a port (165) to the

hydraulic return means to regulate the axial translation of the spool valve
member in order to control the pressure at the discharge means of the retarder

when ported through the spool valve means.
A retarder control system as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the spring means (131) determines the

maximum pressure at the discharge means (163) of the
retarder (145).
A retarder control system as claimed in
claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the spool valve member

(115) further comprises a plurality of radially
extending lands (118-121) which define first, second,

and third sub-chambers (138-140) therebetween and
first and second reaction chambers (128,129) at

opposite ends of the spool valve member.
A retarder control system as claimed in
claim 3, wherein the spool valve member (115) further

comprises an axial bore (190) extending within the
spool valve member to open into the first reaction

chamber (128); and a first radial bore (191) effecting 
communication between the axial bore and the third

A retarder control system as claimed in
claim 4, wherein the modulating solenoid (104)

continuously communicates with the second reaction
chamber (129) when the spool valve member (115) moves

away from the off-position; and a fluid return passage
(165,166) selectively communicates with the third

sub-chamber (140) such that a relatively low pressure
within the third sub-chamber allows a relatively

elevated pressure in the second reaction chamber to
overcome the spring bias in order to effect axial

translation of the spool valve member from the
off-position to the on-position.
A retarder control system as claimed in
claim 5, wherein the modulating solenoid (104)

selectively communicates with a second radial bore
(192) to admit pressurised fluid into the first

reaction chamber (128) in order to assist the spring
means (131) in overcoming the fluid pressure exerted

on the spool valve member (115) by the pressurised
fluid within the second reaction chamber (129) and

thereby translate the spool valve member toward the
off-position.
A retarder control system as claimed in
claim 6, wherein relatively high pressure in the third

sub-chamber (140) assists the spring means (131) in
overcoming the pressure within the second reaction

chamber (129) whereby the spool valve member (115) is
translated toward its off-position.
A retarder control system as claimed in
any one of claims 5 to 7, wherein the third

sub-chamber (140) selectively communicates with the
fluid return passage (165,166) in order to relieve the

accumulator to the input means (143) of the retarder
(145) when the spool valve member (145) is in the

on-position.

any one of claims 1 to 9, wherein the cooler (102)

communicates directly with the converter (101) when
the spool valve member (105) is in the off-position

and/or the cooler communicates directly with the
retarder (145) when the spool valve member is in the

on-position.
A retarder control system as claimed in
claim 10, further comprising a bleeder vent (154)
