<ABSTRACT>
The invention starts out from condensing boiler installations in which the waste-gas conduits are assigned one or more heat exchangers (7, 11, 14), through which the waste gases flow, and a suction fan (12) for the waste gases. In order to be able to monitor these installations simply and safely in particular however to be able to assess whether they are in working order, the suction fan (12), which is arranged at the end of the useful section of the waste-gas conduit, is equipped with a temperature meter (thermometer) or temperature sensor (18) located in the pressure stub.

<CLAIMS>
Waste gas conduit for condensing boiler systems,
esp. for systems having hot water boilers, which conduit

has associated therewith one or more heat exchangers (7,
8), which are connected downstream of the condensing boiler

and are traversed by the combustion gases, esp. for the
heating of floors, ceilings or walls and a suction fan

(12), and a monitoring arrangement for the condensing
boiler system, a flue being associated with the waste gas

conduit, and the flue system being provided to preheat the
combustion air, characterised in that the suction fan (12)

has associated therewith a temperature gauge or temperature
sensor (18) for determining the temperature of the waste or

combustion gases, and the suction fan (12) forms the upper
closure of the pipe (11), which guides the combustion

gases, i.e. it forms the top of the flue, the supply
aperture for the combustion air of the boiler being

situated closely beneath the upper end of the pipe (11).
Waste gas conduit according to claim 1,
characterised in that the temperature gauge or resp. the

temperature sensor (18) is situated on the pressure side of
the suction fan (12).
Waste gas conduit according to claim 2,
characterised in that the temperature sensor (18) protrudes

into the pressure connection (17) of the suction fan (12).
