1-position a (1-4C)alkyl substituent;
 

X¹ is thio, sulphinyl or sulphonyl;
 

Ar is thiazolediyl;
 

R¹ is (1-4C)alkyl, (3-4C)alkenyl or (3-4C)alkynyl; and
 

R² and R³ together form a group of the formula -A²-X²-A³- which 
together with the carbon atom to which A² and A³ are attached define a 

ring having 5 or 6 ring atoms, wherein A² and A³, which may be the same 
or different, each is (1-3C)alkylene and X² is oxy, and which ring may 

bear one or two (1-4C)alkyl substituents;

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns thiazole derivatives and more 
particularly thiazole derivatives which are inhibitors of the enzyme 
5-lipoxygenase (hereinafter referred to as 5-LO). The invention also 
concerns processes for the manufacture of said thiazole derivatives 
and novel pharmaceutical compositions containing them. Also included 
in the invention is the use of said thiazole derivatives in the 
treatment of various diseases such as inflammatory and/or allergic 
diseases in which the direct or indirect products of 5-LO catalysed 
oxidation of arachidonic acid are involved, and the production of new 
medicaments for such use. As stated above the thiazole derivatives described 
hereinafter are inhibitors of 5-LO, which enzyme is known to be 
involved in catalysing the oxidation of arachidonic acid to give rise 
via a cascade process to the physiologically active leukotrienes such 
as leukotriene B₄ (LTB₄) and the peptido-lipid leukotrienes such as 
leukotriene C₄ (LTC₄) and leukotriene D₄ (LTD₄) and various 
metabolites. The biosynthetic relationship and physiological properties 
of the leukotrienes are summarised by G.W. Taylor and S.R. Clarke in 
Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 1986, 7, 100-103. The 
leukotrienes and their metabolites have been implicated in the 
production and development of various diseases, for example various 
inflammatory and allergic diseases such as inflammation of the joints 
(especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), 
inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (especially inflammatory 
bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), skin diseases 
(especially psoriasis, eczema and dermatitis), ocular conditions 
(especially allergic conjunctivitis and uveitis) and respiratory 
disease (especially asthma, bronchitis and allergic rhinitis), for 
example in the production and development of various cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular disorders such as myocardial infarction, the 
formation of atherosclerotic plaques, hypertension, platelet 
aggregation, angina, stroke, reperfusion injury, vascular injury 
including restenosis and peripheral vascular disease, for example in  
 
the formation of the conditions of shock or trauma such as can follow 
burn injuries, toxaemia or surgery, and for example various disorders 
of bone metabolism such as osteoporosis (including senile and 
postmenopausal osteoporosis), Paget's disease, bone metastases, 
hypercalcaemia, hyperparathyroidism, osteosclerosis, osteopetrosis and 
periodontitis, and the abnormal changes in bone
