<ABSTRACT>
An improved method of chemical recovery from kraft black liquor is 
disclosed in which the heat generated by controlled oxidation of the liquor 

is utilized to reduce the viscosity and net heating value of the liquor 
which allows the firing of a more concentrated liquor in the recovery 

boiler. Net steam recovery is increased for a given black liquor feed 
rate. Alternatively, the firing of liquor having a higher solids 

concentration is possible, which increases the throughput of the recovery 
boiler.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed toward the recovery of pulping
chemicals from kraft black liquor, and particularly toward an improved
recovery method which utilizes oxygen to reduce the viscosity and net
heating value of concentrated black liquor to increase recovery boiler
capacity.The treatment of black liquor for recovery of pulping chemicals and
heat value is an important and often limiting step in the kraft pulping
process. Black liquor is a complex mixture of organic wood derivatives and
alkaline pulping chemicals, chiefly containing degraded lignin, organic
acid salts, resins, sodium hydroxide, and sodium salts including carbonate,
sulfide, sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, and mercaptide. Weak black liquor
typically contains 15 wt% dissolved and suspended solids of which about 80%
are organic compounds and the remainder are inorganic compounds.Weak black liquor is concentrated to about 45-50 wt% solids by
multiple effect evaporation and further evaporated by direct contact
evaporation to about 65 wt% solids. The concentrated liquor is combusted in
a recovery boiler to raise steam and to recover sulfur and sodium for reuse
in the pulping step. Oxidation of the sodium sulfide in the black liquor
is necessary prior to the direct contact evaporator to minimize the
emissions of hydrogen sulfide in the flue gas from the recovery boiler.
Newer mills have replaced direct contact evaporators with indirectly-heated
concentrators which eliminate total reduced sulfur emissions and yield
higher liquor solids concentrations of up to 75 wt% before firing to the
recovery boiler. The capacity of the recovery boiler to combust black liquor and
recover inorganic pulping chemicals often limits the production capacity of
a pulp mill. The maximum capacity of the recovery boiler is typically
limited by one or more parameters including fireside deposit formation,
fume formation, and the maximum steam production rating of the boiler.
Fireside deposit formation is caused by high temperatures in the pendant
heat transfer surfaces of the boiler and high gas velocities from the
furnace of the recovery boiler. Fume formation is caused by high
temperatures in the furnace. The steam production rate at a constant
firing rate of black liquor is a function of the available heat of the
black liquor.Increasing the solids concentration of the black liquor fired to the
recovery boiler has several effects on the boiler operation. First, the
fireside deposit formation rate is decreased due to decreased temperature
and gas velocity of

<CLAIMS>
A method for recovering pulping chemicals
from kraft black liquor wherein said black liquor is

concentrated in a plurality of evaporation stages and
fired in a recovery boiler (107) to yield steam and smelt,

comprising

contacting said black liquor (5) with an
oxygen-containing gas (33,67) to oxidize components in

said black liquor (5) at conditions sufficient to heat
said liquor,

whereby the net heating value of
said liquor is decreased and the viscosity of said liquor

is reduced without the addition of external heat, characterised in that
the contacting of said black liquor (5) with an oxygen-containing

gas (33,67) is carried out in a reaction zone
(112,201) to a temperature above 177°C (350°F) and said liquor temperature is maintained above

177°C (350°F) for greater than one minute in a holding zone (115,203) following said
reaction zone, said black liquor (5) being

obtained by partially concentrating weak black liquor (1)
prior to said reaction zone (113,201) by evaporation in

one or more multiple effect evaporation stages (101);
reduced viscosity black liquor
(43,77) is withdrawn from said holding zone (113,201) and flashed

in a flash zone (117; 205)

(45,79) streams; and
utilizing the vapor stream (45,79) from said
flash zone (117) to provide a portion of the heat

requirement either in said multiple effect evaporation stages
(101) or in an indirectly heated concentrator (109) located downstream of said multiple effect evaporation stages (101) and upstream of said reaction zone (201),

temperature during oxidation is less than 203°C (400°F).

said flash zone (117) is further concentrated in a direct contact evaporator (105) to

A method according to Claim 6 wherein
the viscosity of the liquid (87) from said flash zone (205)

is controlled at a selected value by controlling the flow rate of liquid (89) recycled to said reaction zone (201). 
A method according to Claim 6 wherein
the viscosity
