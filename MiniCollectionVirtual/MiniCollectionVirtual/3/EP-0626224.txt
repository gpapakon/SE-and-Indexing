<ABSTRACT>
The process and apparatus relate to the production, from a slip, of a rough (unworked) blank component (10) by means of solidification after injection into a mould at a temperature below 0@C. The mould (1, 2) and the movable parts (6) of the jack (ram) (7) which close it are housed in a leaktight chamber (8). A dry gas dispenser (13) with a dew point below the temperature of the mould emits a gas stream via orifices (14). A chute (9) conveys the rough blank (10) towards an orifice (11) and a receiver (17) outside the chamber. Application to the production of high-density ceramic or metal sintered components with high mechanical characteristics.

vessel comprises, in addition to the outlet aperture open in a

discontinuous manner for the passage of the green, at least a second
outlet aperture controlled by a means for regulating the discharge rate,
