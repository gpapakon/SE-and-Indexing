<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a clutch and brake assembly (6) and, 
more particularly, to such an assembly for use with a 

rotary mower driven by, for example, internal combustion 
engine. Briefly the clutch and brake assembly (6) comprises 

a rotatable drum (11), a centrifugal clutch (C) including a clutch 
element which is movable between an inoperative non-driving 

position and an operative driving position a stationary 
abutment and a brake member (12) mounted on the drum, which 

brake member is resiliently biassed towards engagement with 
the stationary abutment (14) when the clutch element is 

disengaged from the drum and is movable into disengagement 
relative to the stationary abutment by the centrifugal 

clutch when the clutch element is engaged in an operative 
driving position with the drum. Reference is directed to 

Figure 2.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a clutch and brake assembly
and, more particularly to a rotary mower of the type driven
by an internal combustion engine including the clutch and
brake assembly. Such mowers generally comprise a main body
or deck upon which an internal combustion engine is
mounted. The engine crankshaft or an output shaft passes
through the mower deck and supports a cutting blade which
is rotatable in a horizontal plane within the deck. Where
the cutting blade is directly mounted to the crankshaft or
the output shaft and when the mower is left unattended
while the engine is operating, for instance, to empty a
removable grass collection receptacle, a potentially
serious safety hazard may present itself. This is due to
a person sometimes having unimpeded access to the cutting
blade via a grass cutting delivery chute extending from
beneath the deck and to the grass collection receptacle.
In order to avoid such a potential hazard, a user is not
infrequently advised to stop the engine each time the grass
collection receptacle is to be emptied. Where, however, a
rotary mower is powered by a hand-start internal combustion
engine, such a stopping procedure results in considerable
manual effort each time the engine is re-started and causes
premature wear to certain engine components.Certain devices have been proposed to overcome the
above problems by the use of a clutch and brake mechanism
to disengage drive, and apply a braking force to the blade
and associated components. Many of these devices however 
tend to be complicated, expensive, require separate
control cables and levers and, in particular, are prone to
ingress of dirt and debris which reduces their
effectiveness.A known lawnmower is disclosed in US4369616 in which
a motor drives an output drive shaft which in turn drives
a centrifugal clutch. When the drive shaft is driven
above a certain speed, the centrifugal clutch extends
outwardly to engage with a tapered frusto-conical contact
surface so as to drive a cutter blade. The frusto-conical
contact surface includes a brake shoe which is resiliently
held against a fixed braking surface. When the
centrifugal clutch is thrown outwardly to meet the frustoconical
contact surface, the surface is longitudinally
displaced so as to move the brake shoe away from the
braking surface.It is an object of the present invention to overcome
or at least reduce many of the problems identified above,
and to produce a totally enclosed unit preventing ingress
of dirt and debris.According to the present invention, a

<CLAIMS>
A clutch and brake assembly comprising

a rotatable body (11),
a centrifugal clutch (C) including a clutch element
(16) which is movable between an inoperative non-driving

position and an operative driving position,
a stationary abutment (14) and
a brake member (12) mounted on the rotatable body
(11), which brake member (12) is resiliently biassed

towards engagement with the stationary abutment (14) when
the clutch element (16) is disengaged from the rotatable

body (11) and is movable into disengagement relative to
the stationary abutment (14) by the centrifugal clutch (C)

when the clutch element (16) is engaged in an operative
driving position with the rotatable body (11),
characterised in that
 the rotatable body is a drum
(11), and in that the clutch element (16) is arranged to

act directly on the brake member (12) to cause it to move
relative to the rotatable body and into disengagement

relative to the stationary abutment (14).
A clutch and brake assembly according to claim 1,
characterised in that the clutch element (16) acts on an 

inner face of the drum (11).
A clutch and brake assembly according to claim 2,
characterised in that the brake member (12) is a band fixed to

the drum (11) at one end, and attached resiliently to the drum
(11) at the distal end.
A clutch and brake assembly according to claim 3,
characterised in that the brake band (12) is resiliently

attached for extension in its length.
A clutch and brake assembly according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the centrifugal clutch (C) is

rotatable by a prime mover.
A clutch and brake assembly according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the drum (11) is rotatably

connected directly or indirectly to an output shaft (10).
A clutch and brake assembly according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the assembly is attached to a

rotary lawn mower and wherein the output shaft is connected to
a rotatable blade.
