<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a Wolfrom planetary gearing with planet gears (7) which are split axially into two areas with different toothing. One (11) of these areas meshes simultaneously with a rotating sun gear (8) and with a fixed internal gear (13), while the second area (12) meshes only in a rotatable internal gear (5). The intention is to configure this gearing in such a way that its operating noise is low, that there is little backlash and that it is small in size. This is particularly important for gearings with a plurality of planet gears distributed around the periphery of the gearing. For this purpose, the two differently toothed areas of the planet gears are cut helically in opposite directions. The opposing helical toothings are on separately produced component planet gears which are combined for operation, giving a unitary planet gear with two areas of toothing. This makes possible simple, efficient manufacture of the opposing helical toothing on a planet gear which forms a single unit in operation. Any manufacturing and assembly tolerances are cancelled out by the self-centring of the opposing parts of the planet gears due to the opposing helical toothing.

Wolfrom planetary gear system with planet wheels which 
are axially split into two differently toothed regions, of 

which the first region meshes simultaneously in a rotating sun 
wheel and fixed ring gear and the second region meshes only in 

a rotatable ring gear, characterized in that the two 
differently toothed regions (11, 12) of the planet wheels (7) 

are helically geared in opposite directions, each of the two 
regions taken independently having a uniform identical tooth 

skew. 
Wolfrom gear system according to claim 1, characterized 
in that the two planet wheel regions (11, 12) have different 

pitch circle diameters. 
Wolfrom gear system according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that the skew angle of the two planet wheel 

regions (11, 12) is unequal in opposite directions. 
Wolfrom gear system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the planet wheels 7 are axially 

freely movably mounted. 
Wolfrom gear system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the planet wheels 7 each consist 

of two axially interconnected, separately produced partial 
planet wheels (14, 15) forming the first and second region 

(11, 12) respectively. 
Wolfrom gear system according to claim 5, characterized 
in that the partial planet wheels (14, 15) are connected to 

one another by screws (16) which are distributed round the 
periphery and are introduced into continuous threaded bores 

axially aligned through both parts in each case.  
 
Wolfrom gear system according to one of the preceding 
claims, characterized by the features: 


a) the gear housing is essentially in three parts with a 
central part (1) fixed between two terminal covers (2, 3), 
b) the first respective region (11) of the planet wheels (7) 
meshes in a ring gear (13) rigidly connected to the housing 

central part (1) and has a greater pitch circle diameter and 
larger number of teeth in comparison with the second region 

(12), 
c) a sun wheel (8) acts on an outwardly leading first shaft 
(driving shaft 9) on the first region (11) of the planet 

wheels (7), 
d) a ring gear (5) rotatably mounted in the gear housing and 
connected to a second outwardly leading shaft (output shaft 4) 

meshes in the second respective region (12) of the planet 
wheels (7). 
Wolfrom gear system according to claim 7, characterized 
in that the rotatable ring gear (5) connected to the second 

outwardly leading shaft (output shaft 4) is axially and 
radially mounted in the terminal housing cover (3) facing the 

second planet wheel region (12). 
Wolfrom gear system according to claim 7 or 8, 
chara
cterized in that the planet wheels (7) are mounted in a 
planet carrier (6) which on the one hand rests radially 

internally on either side of the planet wheels (7) on the 
first shaft (driving shaft 9) and on the other hand is 

supported radially externally at one axial end in the terminal 
housing cover (2) facing the first planet wheel region (11) 

and at its other end within the rotatable ring gear (5).
