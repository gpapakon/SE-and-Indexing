<ABSTRACT>
The instrument transformer (4, 21) according to the invention, especially a current transformer or voltage transformer, is in each case integrated in an annular flange (3, 11) or is fastened thereto. The annular flange (3, 11) is constructed to be narrow in the axial direction with respect to the axial length of the respective instrument transformer (4, 12), so that it can be inserted between two housing parts (1, 2) of an encapsulating housing of a high-voltage switching installation in a space-saving manner. The instrument transformer, which is in each case fastened to the annular flange (3, 11) in this case projects into one of the other housing parts. The annular flange (3, 11) has at least one bushing (9, 19) for an instrumentation cable (8, 18) of the instrument transformer.

<CLAIMS>
Instrument transformer arrangement having an
instrument transformer (4, 21), in particular a current

transformer or voltage transformer, and having an
instrument lead (8, 18) for installation in an

enclosure housing of a high-voltage switchgear that is
penetrated in the axial direction by a high-voltage

conductor (10), the instrument transformer (4, 21)
being fastened in a load-bearing manner to a metallic

ring flange (3, 11), the thickness of which in the
axial direction is less than the length of the

instrument transformer in this direction, characterised
in that the ring flange (3, 11) has at least one

insulated, gastight leadthrough (9, 19) for the
instrument lead (8, 18) of the instrument transformer

(4, 21), and in that the instrument lead inside the
enclosure housing is screened from the high-voltage

conductor by a metallic tube (5, 12) which is fastened
in a load-bearing manner to the ring flange.
Instrument transformer according to claim 1,
characterised in that the instrument transformer is a

toroidal-core current transformer (4), the supporting
tube (5) of which, which supporting tube supports the

toroidal cores (6), is constructed in one piece with
the ring flange (3, 11).
Instrument transformer according to claim 1,
characterised in that the instrument transformer is a

voltage transformer (21), the measuring electrode (12)
of which is integrated in the ring flange (3, 11).
