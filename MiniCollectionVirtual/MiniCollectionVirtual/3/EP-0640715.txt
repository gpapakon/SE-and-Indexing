<ABSTRACT>
An artificial leather composed 
of a sheetlike fiber assembly base, 

a porous polyurethane layer having 
interconnected micropores and formed 

on at least one side of the base, and 
a nonporous polyurethane coating 

formed on the porous layer. The porous 
poluyrethane layer has numerous open 

pores scattered therein, part of the pores 
being blocked by the nonporous coating 

while the rest being left unblocked, and 
at least 70 % of the unblocked pores 

have diameters of 1-25 µm. This leather 
is produced by tightly adhering the 

porous polyurethane layer to the fiber 
assembly base, coating the polyurethane 

layer with a mixture of a polyurethane 
and a solvent so as to form numerous 

scattered spots to thereby generate 
numerous open pores on the surface 

of the polyurethane layer, and further 
coating the surface thus treated with a 

nonporous polyurethane.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a grained artificial
leather, and a process for making the same. This grained
artificial leather has good air permeability and water
vapor permeability, and exhibits surface smoothness, stain
resistance and abrasion resistance, which are improved over
those of conventional grained artificial leather. This
invention also relates to fabricated articles such as shoes,
gloves, a chair and clothes, which have in at least part
thereof the grained artificial leather.Artificial leathers composed of a fibrous sheet and
a high polymeric elastomer have come into general use as
essential leather substitutes in many fields such as shoe
uppers, auxiliary materials for shoes and clothes. These
artificial leathers are classified into three types
according to the surface configuration: a suede type, a
nubuk type and a grain type. Of these, a suede type and a
nubuk type can have good air permeability and water vapor
permeability. But, since a grain type has a finishing
non-porous surface layer composed of a synthetic resin, the
air permeability and vapor permeability are not
satisfactory. Especially, shoe uppers and clothes
fabricated from a grained artificial leather exhibit an
undesirably large stuffiness in wear, and thus, it is
desired to reduce the stuffiness.To solve the above-mentioned problem, an attempt has
been made to mechanically needle the grained artificial
leather for imparting an air permeability to reduce the
stuffiness. This problem is solved when the needle 
apertures are large enough for the intended reduction of
stuffiness, but another problem arises in that fine dusts
enter the apertures and thus the leather is stained and the
appearance of the leather becomes poor. When the needle
apertures are small enough for avoiding staining due to fine
dusts, the water vapor permeability is not satisfactory.A proposal of forming a finishing polyurethane film
on a base composed of a mixture of fibers and a high
polymeric elastomer has been made to provide an artificial
leather having discontinuous film characteristics. The
artificial leather also has surface apertures having a large
diameter and thus is stained, and the fibrous texture is not
completely concealed by the finishing film and develops on
the outer surface. Thus the artificial leather does not
have a smooth surface nor an attractive appearance. Further
the artificial leather does not have a porous polyurethane
layer and therefore the abrasion resistance is poor.In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 59-116479,
