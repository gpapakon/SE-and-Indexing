<ABSTRACT>
An electrical power generating arrangement 2 (for 
example, in a CHP system) is which electric power for supply 

to mains or grid 20 is output from a generator 4 driven via 
a continuously variable transmission (C.V.T.) 6 by an 

internal combustion engine 8 having a throttle 12. The 
throttle opening and ratio of the C.V.T. are controlled by 

controller 26 comprising a computer programmed with an 
engine map which is consulted by the computer when there is 

a change in an external load 22 power demand. For any load, 
the map indicates at which speed the engine 8 should be run 

for optimum engine efficiency, the throttle opening is 
varied to attain that speed, and the controller 26 varies 

the ratio of the C.V.T. to a value consistent with the 
desired engine speed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention concerns an electrical power 
generating arrangement from which the electrical power 
output is to be connected to the electrical mains. The electrical power generating arrangement may be 
included in a combined heat and power system (CHP), though 
it need not necessarily be. In some known CHP systems the electrical generator 
feeding its output into the electrical mains or grid is 
rotated at substantially constant speed by a reciprocating 
internal combustion engine giving a substantially constant 
speed rotary output driving the generator. Since the engine 
rotates at a substantially constant number of revolutions 
per minute (r.p.m.) whatever the electrical power demand 
from the generator by an external circuit being supplied, 
the engine is not necessarily operating at optimum 
efficiency which optimum efficiency may occur at a lower 
r.p.m. than the aforesaid constant r.p.m. for low power 
demand or at a higher r.p.m. for higher power demand. Also 
best advantage cannot be taken of using high revving high 
performance engines produced for motor vehicles. An object of the invention is to provide an 
electrical power generating arrangement from which the 
electrical power output is to be connected to the electrical 
mains or grid in which the arrangement is capable of being 
used with the engine running at variable speed. Electrical generators driven through a variable transmission are known from DE-B-1 117 204.  
 According to the invention there is provided an 
electrical power generating arrangement from which the 
electrical power output is to be connected to the electrical 
mains, 
   said electrical power generating arrangement 
being characterised by a reciprocating internal combustion 
engine and an electrical power generator rotatably driven by 
rotary drive derived from said engine and applied to said 
generator through a drive line comprising a continuously 
variable transmission, and the speed of said engine being 
variable as a function of variation in electric power output 
from the generator. The invention will now be further described, by way 
of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in 
which:- 
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatic representation of an 
electrical power generating arrangement formed according to 
the invention; Figs. 2, 3 and 4 show examples of graphs 
representing variation of engine efficiency plotted against 
variation of percentage throttle opening for an internal 
combustion engine of the kind used in the arrangement in 
Fig. 1 running at

(26) comprises computer means programmed with an engine map 
representing a function of variation of engine speed with  

  
 

variation in power output from the generator (4), the 
arrangement being such that said map is consulted by the 

control means (26), when a variation in electric power from
