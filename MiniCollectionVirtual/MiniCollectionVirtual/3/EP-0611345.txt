<ABSTRACT>
A clutch control system for a motor vehicle having an engine (10), a gearbox (12) having a plurality of gear ratios, and a clutch (14) providing a drive connection between the engine and the gearbox. The control system includes a clutch actuation means (22) for controlling the state of engagement of the clutch and a control unit (36) which receives signals from a plurality of vehicle operating parameter sensors including a gear sensor (32) which indicates that a gear ratio is engaged in the gearbox. The control unit (36) processes these signals to produce a command signal for operation of the clutch actuating means. The control unit (36) ensures that if on powering-up of the control unit (36) the control unit receives a signal from the gear sensor (32) indicating that a gear ratio is engaged in the gearbox (12), the control unit inhibits disengagement of the clutch (14) by the clutch actuation means (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a clutch system 
for a vehicle. The applicant's earlier patent GB-A-2088007 and 
PCT patent application WO92/08065 (published 14.05.92) describe 
clutch control systems for achieving progressive 
engagement of a vehicle clutch to provide a smooth 
clutch take up from a vehicle at rest condition. The control logic of the above clutch control 
systems can prove disadvantageous in a hill start 
situation and can result in inadvertent rolling of 
a vehicle parked on an incline at start up when the 
vehicle is left in gear to supplement, or instead 
of using, the parking brake. Furthermore in such 
systems, if the engine cannot be started due to 
failure or partial failure of the self starting 
system, the engine cannot be started by any of the 
commonly accepted emergency starting means such as 
push-starting or tow-starting.  
 It is an object of the present invention to provide 
a clutch control system which mitigates the above 
problems. According to the present invention there is 
provided a clutch control system for a vehicle 
having an engine, a gearbox having plurality of 
gear ratios, and a clutch providing a drive 
connection between the engine and the gearbox, the 
control system comprising a clutch actuation means 
for controlling the state of engagement of the 
clutch, a control unit which receives signals from 
a plurality of vehicle operating parameter sensors 
including a gear sensor which indicates that a gear 
ratio is engaged in the gearbox, the control unit 
processing these signals to produce a command 
signal for operation of the clutch actuating means, 
and an electrical power supply circuit for the 
control unit, the control system being 
characterised in that if on activation of the 
electrical power supply circuit to power-up the 
control unit the control unit receives a signal 
from the gear sensor indicating that a gear ratio 
is engaged in the gearbox, the control unit 
inhibits disengagement of the clutch by the clutch 
actuation means.  
 The control unit may also be arranged to inhibit 
operation of an engine starter circuit of the 
vehicle when clutch disengagement is inhibited. Preferably the engine starter circuit includes a 
starter inhibit relay which is operated to inhibit 
operation of the starter circuit. The control unit preferably deactivates the starter 
inhibit relay on receiving a signal that neutral 
has been selected in the gearbox. Preferably an engine starter circuit activation 
sensor is provided and the control unit commands

A clutch control system for a motor vehicle 
having an engine (10) a gearbox (12) having 

a plurality of gear ratios, and a clutch (14) 
providing a drive connection between the 

engine and the gearbox the control system 
comprising a clutch actuation means (22) for 

controlling the state of engagement of the 
clutch, a control unit (36) which receives 

signals from a plurality of vehicle operating 
parameter sensors including a gear sensor 

(32) which indicates that a gear ratio is 
engaged in the gearbox, the control unit 

processing these signals to produce a command 
signal (Vc) for operation of the clutch 

actuating means, and an electrical power 
supply circuit (50,53,54) for the control unit 

(36), the control system being characterised 
in that, if on activation of the electrical 

power supply circuit (50,53,54) to power-up 
the control unit (36) the control unit 

receives a signal from the gear position 
sensor (32) indicating that a gear ratio is 

engaged in the gearbox, the control unit (36) 
inhibits disengagement of the clutch (14) 

by the clutch actuation means (22).  
 
A control system according to Claim 1 for a 
vehicle having an engine starter circuit 

(50,51,52), the system being characterised in 
that the control unit (36) also inhibits 

operation of the starter circuit when clutch 
disengagement is inhibited. 
A control system according to Claim 2 
characterised in that the engine starter 

circuit includes a starter inhibit relay (51) 
which is operated to inhibit operation of the 

starter circuit (50,51,52). 
A control system according to any one of 
claims 1 to 3 for a vehicle having an engine 

starter circuit (50,51,52) characterised by 
the provision of an engine starter circuit 

activation sensor (26) and in that the 
control unit (36) commands disengagement of 

the clutch (14) by the clutch activation 
means (22) on receipt of a signal from the 

engine starter circuit activation sensor (26) 
and from the gear sensor (32) indicating an 

attempt to start the engine when a gear ratio 
is engaged.  

 
A control system according to any one of 
Claims 1 to 4 for a vehicle having a gear 

lever for selection of the operative gear 
ratio characterised in that the gear lever 

(24) is provided which a load sensor (25) 
which indicates to the control unit (36) when 

the gear lever is moved, and in that the 
control unit on receipt of a gear lever 

movement signal from the load sensor commands 
the clutch actuation means (22) to disengage 

the clutch. 
A control system according to any one of 
claims 2 to 4 or claim 5 when dependent on 

claim 2 characterised in that the control unit 
(36) reactivates the starter circuit
