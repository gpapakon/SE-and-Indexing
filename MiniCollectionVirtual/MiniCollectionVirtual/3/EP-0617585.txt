<ABSTRACT>
A block of flat bags can be suspended from a block gripping means which grips the block of bags and wherein the bags are held in the block through the agency of perforated tear-lines. To facilitate filling of one bag at a time, the bag gripping means includes two mutually parallel strip-like parts (2, 3) between which the block (1) is placed in a manner such as to enable the bags to be torn from the block one at a time. The front edge of respective bags lies free from the nearest lying strip-like part (2), which presents two downwardly projecting hooks (10, 11) slightly above the outside (9) of the uppermost bag. The hooks are spaced at a given distance apart so as to engage the circumferential opening edge (17, 18, 19) of the bag from within as the front edge (17, 18) of the bag is lifted over the hooks (10, 11) and held outwardly stretched from the plane of the bag.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an arrangement for 
taking bags singly from a flat block of bags and opening 
said bag to enable articles to be placed thereinto, said 
arrangement including bag gripping means and said bags 
being held in the block by means of perforated tear-lines 
on respective bags. Arrangements of this kind are known to the art and 
include two hooks on which the block of bags is hung, 
the upper part of the block having two holes through 
which the hooks can be passed. When a bag is to be used, 
the uppermost bag or first bag in the block is torn 
along the tear-line and opened on one side of the block 
and articles are placed in the bag. In this respect, it 
is necessary to hold the bag either with two hands or 
with one hand, therewith making it difficult in this 
latter case to hold the bag open wide enough for the 
articles to be placed in the bag with the other hand. 
When the bags contained in the block are made of thin 
material, it is also difficult to grip one bag at a time 
from the underlying block. When the block of bags lies 
on a flat supporting surface and is thus not supported 
by any form of attachment, further difficulties are 
encountered in loosening one bag at a time from the 
block and in holding the bag open so that one or several 
articles can be placed therein. It is also known, see NO-B-155 223 and SE-B-406 307, to 
hang up a bundle of bags on a hook means, which is passed 
through the handle openings of said bags. The bags are 
however not held in a block through perforated tear-lines 
on respective bags.  
 The object of the present invention is to provide an 
arrangement which will enable the bags to be held open 
with one hand and therewith leave the other hand free to 
place articles into the bag. In this regard, the bags 
shall be supported or fastened by a block attachment 
means so that, e.g., the weight of the articles will not 
subject the hand which holds the bag open to the weight  
 
of the articles as they are placed into the bag. After 
having placed the articles in the bag, it shall be a 
simple matter to release the bag from the block attachment 
means, and carry away the bag. So as to provide the aforesaid advantages and to solve 
the aforesaid problems, the inventive arrangement has 
been given the characteristic features set forth in the 
following claims. An exemplifying embodiment of the 
invention will now be described with reference to the 
accompanying drawings, in which 
Figure 1 illustrates a block attachment means which

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for taking bags singly from a block of flat 
bags and opening said bag to enable articles to be placed 

thereinto, said arrangement including bag gripping means, and 
said bags being held in the block through perforated tear-lines 

(6) on respective bags, 
characterized
 in that 
the bag gripping means includes two mutually parallel strip-like 

parts (2, 3) between which the block (1) is placed in a 
manner to enable the bags to be torn from the block one at at 

time; in that the forward edges of the bags lie free from the 
nearest lying strip-like part (2), said part (2) having two 

downwardly extending hooks (10, 11) which project out slightly 
above the front side (9) of the uppermost or outermost bag and 

which are spaced a given distance apart so as to engage the 
circumferentially extending opening edge (17, 18, 19) of said 

uppermost or outermost bag from within as the front edge (17, 
18) of said uppermost or outermost bag is lifted over the hooks 

(10, 11) and held outwardly stretched from the plane of said 
uppermost or outermost bag. 
An arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the hooks (10, 11) lie in the plane of the 

strip-like part (2); and in that the hooked shape is turned 
outwardly towards the side edges (12) of the flat bags. 
An arrangement according to claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the strip-like parts (2,3) are comprised of 

two mutually releasable bars which firmly grip the block (1) 
of bags therebetween at a position located above the perforated 

bag tear-lines, said bars being held together by means of 
fastener devices (4, 5) which extend essentially from the front 

surface of the most forward bar (2) and through the rear bar 
(3). 
An arrangement according to any one of the preceeding 
claims, 
characterized
 in that the strip-like 
parts (2, 3) can be mounted on a side support for the block of 

flat bags.
