<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a device making it possible, in the event of an accident, to open or to close a gate valve (1) the gate (3) of which moves in translation and is usually activated by a motor (6). The device according to the invention comprises a linkage system (7) including an enclosure (8) containing a ring (19) clamped tightly around the ends (20 and 21) of the operating shaft (4) and of the driveshaft (5). In normal operation a shear pin (22) secures the ring to the shafts (4, 5). In the event of the motor being unobtainable, under the action of the pressure of a fluid introduced via an orifice (30), the pin (22) breaks and the ring comes to bear on a stop (29) situated below the said ring and borne by the operating shaft (4) of the gate valve in order to act as a piston and close the gate (3) thereof. When the ring is not clamped directly around the ends of the two shafts, but the latter, penetrating one another, are clamped together in a connecting assembly supported by the said ring and when the operating shaft has a second stop situated above the ring, it is also possible to open the gate when the motor is unavailable. The device according to the invention makes it possible to retain use of the motor (6) under normal circumstances.

Safety device for actuation of a valve (1, 101)
comprising a body (2, 102) and having an obturator (3, 103)

which moves by translation and which is controlled by a
control shaft (4, 104) which is itself driven by a driving

shaft (5, 105) disposed in the prolongation of the said
control shaft (4, 104) and integral with the latter through

a connection system (7, 107) characterized in that:

1) the said connection system (7, 107) comprises a
hollow cylindrical enclosure (8, 108) into which

penetrate each of the two shafts, the said enclosure
(8, 108) containing a gastight ring (19,52, 119) which

in translation is made integral with at least one of
the two shafts by means of a contact piece (22, 51,

151, 177) which is retractable under the action of a
pressure exerted on the said ring (19,52, 119),
2) the said ring (19,52, 119) carries a connection
assembly (27,28, 60,61,63, 160,161) which

simultaneously grips the ends of the said control
shaft (4, 104) and of the said driving shaft (5, 105)

located inside the said enclosure (8, 108),
3) the said enclosure (8, 108) comprises an upper
orifice (30, 130) located so that it is above the said

ring (19,52, 119) when the valve is open,
4) the said control shaft (4, 104) comprises at least
one limit stop (29, 129) disposed so that it is below

the said ring (19,52, 119) and inside the said
enclosure (8, 108) irrespective of the position of the

obturator (3, 103),
5) a fluid source is connected to the said upper
orifice (30, 130).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that the
said connection assembly is incorporated into the said ring

(19,52).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in that the
said fluid source is a pressurized gas source (31).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
said gas source (31) is a pressurized gas tank equipped

with a tap (32).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
said gas source (31) is a pyrotechnic gas generator

equipped with an initiator.
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
end (21) of the driving shaft (5) penetrates into the end

(20) of the control shaft (4), the said latter end being
hollow.
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in that the
said contact piece is a shearable pin (22) which

simultaneously renders integral the ring (19), the control
shaft (4) and the driving shaft (5).
Device according to Claim 7, characterized in that the
said end (20) of the control shaft (4) comprises at least

one transverse channel (25) in which are disposed, on both
sides of the driving shaft (5), at least two balls (27,28)

which are radially clamped by the ring (19) and which bear
against the the bottom of a circular groove (26) carried by

the end (21) of the driving shaft (5).
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
end of the control shaft (4) penetrates into the end of the

driving shaft (5), the said latter end being hollow. 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in that the
ring (52) has an upper cylindrical cavity (53) and in that

the ends (58,59) of the said shafts (4,5) are widened and
gripped in at least two retaining catches (60,61) which are

themselves disposed in the cavity (53) comprised by the
ring (52).
Device according to Claim 10, characterized in that
the said contact piece is a thrust spring (51) bearing both
