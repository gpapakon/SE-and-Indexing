<ABSTRACT>
A personnel protection system for electrical connections is disclosed, which is of the type that differentially senses the current flow between the power lead (50) and the return lead (52) (or between two power loads) is provided with an unbalancing impedance (70) which makes the current difference between the two leads sufficiently high to trip the device (48) and cause the power to be disconnected. A utilization device (64) is similarly provided with an imbalanced impedance (80). However, that impedance is calculated to counteract the current imbalance caused by the first impedance (70), so that when the cable is connected to the utilization device (64), the current balance between the two conductors (50, 52) is restored, and power connection is maintained in the cable. Thus, the system does not provide continuous power unless predetermined conditions considered safe for securing the power are fully satisfied.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to electrical 
power systems and, more particularly, concerns a 
system for protecting personnel against accidental electrical 
shock at an electrical power connection. There are many instances in which it is desirable 
to run an electrical power cable from a location at which a 
power source is located to a remote location. For example, 
this becomes necessary when utilizing AC power to operate 
portable power tools at a location remote from a building. 
Similarly, it is desirable to be capable of charging an 
electrical vehicle by running an electrical cable from a 
power source, such as an AC wall outlet to the location of 
the vehicle. It has been a common practice to provide perscnnel 
protection devices against accidental electric shock in such 
cables in the case of a ground fault. Typically, such 
ground fault protection involves differential sensing of a 
current flow in the power lead and the return lead in the 
cable and disconnecting the power to the cable when the 
difference (an imbalance) exceeds a predetermined threshold 
value. Ground fault protection is effective to avoid electric 
shock when a person who is grounded accidently touches 
the power lead or the return lead. Resulting current flowing 
through the person will flow through one of these leads, 
but not the other, thereby causing tripping of the protection  
 
system, and protecting the individual against electrocution 
by turning off the power to the cable. One form of personnel protection is particularly 
desirable. That is, to assure that no power is connected to 
the cable, unless the cable is connected to a utilization or 
load device. Various forms of mechanical interlocks have 
been utilized to make power at the remote end of the cable 
inaccessible, unless the cable is connected to a utilization 
device. However, such interlocks suffer from relatively low 
reliability, in that any mechanical failure of the interlock 
is likely to result in electric shock to an individual. 
Furthermore, the mechanical interlocks and their modes of 
operation are entirely visible and apparent to a user. 
Accordingly, mechanical interlocks are particularly vulnerable 
to being defeated by persons who simply do not want to 
be inconvenienced by the interlocks. This is often another 
source of personnel injury. Broadly, it is an object of the present invention 
to avoid the shortcomings of prior personnel protection 
systems for electrical connections. It is specifically an 
object of the present
