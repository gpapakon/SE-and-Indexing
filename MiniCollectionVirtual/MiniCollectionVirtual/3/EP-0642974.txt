<ABSTRACT>
The on-board equipment comprises a cartridge launcher box (10) intended to be fixed permanently to an aircraft, containing firing circuits, and a removable loader (12), replaceable after each mission, forming parallel cells for accommodating cartridges. A device for retaining the loader in the cartridge launcher box includes a U-shaped stirrup (16) having two side branches mounted on the box so as to be able to turn about a spindle (17) between a position in which the stirrup holds the box in place and a position in which it frees it. The stirrup carries a latch mounted in such a way as to be able to rock about an axis orthogonal to the direction of insertion of the loader into the box. The latch includes, on one side of its spindle, a fork intended to be engaged under a stop piece belonging to the cartridge launcher box and, on the other side of the spindle, a bolt (30) intended to clip into a keeper (38) provided on the stirrup.

On-board launching equipment for cartridges, comprising 
a cartridge-launching casing (10) adapted to be 

permanently attached to an aircraft and containing 
firing circuits; a detachable and replaceable loader 

(12) which is formed with receptacles for cartridges; 
and a device which retains the loader in the cartridge-launching 

casing and comprises a U-shaped stirrup (16) 
having two side arms (18) so mounted on the casing (10) 

as to be rotatable around a pivot (17) between a position 
in which the stirrup retains the loader (12) in 

place and a position in which it releases the loader, 
the casing being provided with latching means, characterised 

in that the latching means comprise at least one 
latch (24, 30) which is so mounted on the stirrup as to 

be tiltable around a pivot (22) at right angles, in the 
retention position, to the direction in which the loader 

is inserted into the casing and which comprises on the 
pivot side a fork adapted to engage under a stop (28) 

associated with the cartridge-launching casing, and on 
the other side of the pivot a sliding bolt (30) which is 

adapted to latch into a keeper (38) provided on the 
stirrup and which can be withdrawn manually for its 

disengagement from the keeper. 
Equipment according to Claim 1, characterised in 
that it comprises a single latch disposed on the cross-arm 

(20) of the stirrup (16). 
Equipment according to Claims 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the stop is formed by a shoulder bounding a 

bulging portion of a rod (26) and parallel with the 
direction of insertion. 
Equipment according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the sliding bolt (30) of the latch 

is slidably mounted on a member (24) rotated around the 
pivot (22) of the latch and is repelled into a position  

 
of predetermined projection by a spring (36) interposed 

between the sliding bolt and said member. 
Equipment according to Claim 4, characterised in 
that said member (24) comprises the fork adapted to 

enclose the rod (26) and to come into abutment with the 
stop (28). 
Equipment according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the loader (12) comprises at least 

one stud (40) projecting in the direction of the cartridge-launching 
casing (10) and a catch (44) in the 

bottom of the cartridge-launching casing which can be 
disarmed by taking action on a rod (48) projection out 

of the casing. 
Equipment according to any of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that the stirrup (16) comprises, beyond 

the pivot (17) around which it rotates, prolongations 
(54) adapted to engage under projections (14) of the 

loader (12) to lift the loader.
