<ABSTRACT>
The sensor (1) has a first, a second and a third force transducer (12, 13, 14) with a foil (5) of piezoelectric material shared by all three transducers (12, 13, 14) and electrodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) fitted thereon. The second and third transducers (13, 14) are on opposite sides of the first transducer (12) and have a smaller transducing area than the first one. To measure blood pressure, the sensor (1) is pressed on a part of the patient's body so that the first, central transducer (12) is at the shortest possible distance from a major artery (3). During measurement, the absolute value of the changes in the measurements generated by the three transducers (12, 13, 14) caused by the pulsed flow of the blood are added together. The changes in measurements caused by parasitic forces can thus be compensated.

A sensor for measuring blood pressure, with fastening means 
for pressing a first force pick-up (12, 42) against a portion of 

a living body containing an artery (3, 33), where in addition to 
said first force pick-up (12, 42) a second and a third force 

pick-up (13, 14, 43, 44) are provided, which are located one on 
either side of said first force pick-up (12, 42), 
characterized 
in that
 the three force pick-ups (12, 13, 14, 42, 43, 44) each 
have a pick-up surface lying close to the body, and that the 

pick-up surface of the second and third force pick-up (13, 14, 
43, 44) is smaller than that of the first force pick-up (12, 42), 

and further that the second and third force pick-ups are 
connected subtractively relative to the first force pick-up. 
A sensor as in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the three 
force pick-ups (12, 13, 14, 42, 43, 44) are configured as 

piezoelectric transducers. 
A sensor as in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that
 the three 
force pick-ups (12, 13, 14, 42, 43, 44) are provided with one 

common piece of flexible foil (5, 25), which is made of piezoelectric 
material and carries a number of electrodes (6, 7, 8, 9, 

10, 11, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41).  
 
A sensor as in any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that
 
the fastening means are provided with at least one spring 

component, for example, a spring clip (2), and/or a part made of 
foam rubber, elastically pressing the three force pick-ups (12, 

13, 14, 42, 43, 44) against the living body. 
A device for measuring blood pressure, with a sensor as 
described in any of claims 1 to 4, where said sensor is designed 

to form a first measurement variable and a second measurement 
variable and a third measurement variable, which measure the 

force and/or change of force obtained from the first and second 
and third force pick-up, 
characterized in that
 the second and 
third force pick-up (13, 14, 43, 44) are connected electrically 

parallel to each other and anti-parallel to the first force 
pick-up (12, 42). 
A device for measuring blood pressure, with a sensor as 
described in any of claims 1 to 4, and with electronic circuitry, 

where said circuitry is designed to form a first measurement 
variable and a second measurement variable and a third 

measurement variable measuring the force and/or change of force 
obtained from the first and second and third force pick-up, 


characterized in that
 the electronic circuitry (51) is provided 
with at least one manually adjustable adjusting element (55, 56, 

57) in order to combine adjustably at least one of the first,  
 

second and third measurement variables with an electric signal 
generated by the respective force pick-up (12, 13, 14, 42, 43, 

44). 
A device as in claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 the force 
pick-ups (12, 13, 14, 42, 43, 44) and the circuitry (21, 51) are 

designed to combine the three measurement variables in such a way 
that the absolute values of the changes in the second and third 

measurement variable are subtracted from the absolute value of 
the change in the first measurement variable. 
A device as in claim 5 or 6, 
characterized in that
 the force 
pick-ups (12, 13, 14, 42, 43, 44) and the circuitry (21, 51) are 

designed to subtract the second measurement variable and the 
third measurement variable from the first measurement variable, 

thus forming a fourth measurement variable as a measure for the 
blood pressure. 
A device as in any of claims 5 to 8, 
characterized in that
 
at least part of the electronic circuitry (51) is located in a 

housing (34) supported by the fastening means. 
A device as in any of claims 5 to 9, 
characterized in that
 
the electronic circuitry (21, 51) is provided with calibration 

means (25, 59) for setting and/or entering at least one  
 

calibration value, and/or can be connected thereto, permitting 
determination of the systolic and/or diastolic blood pressure in 

at least quasi-continuous fashion after at least one calibration 
value has been set and/or entered, this value having been 

obtained by a measurement on the body with a calibration/measuring 
device.
