A process for producing polyolefin foam particles 
by means of dispersion foaming, characterized in that 

during discharge of the reactor contents, which consist 
essentially of polyolefin particles, a liquid dispersion 

medium and, if desired, a volatile blowing agent, into a 
low-pressure space, the reactor contents have gas introduced 

into the dispersion in such a way that a three-phase 
mixture of dispersion medium, polymer particles and 

gas exits through the nozzle,
 
except for a process for producing foam beads of polymers 

which is characterized in that 

a) polymer particles and a dispersion medium are continuously 
fed to a slender, pressure-operated, 

unstirred mass-transfer column and are here subjected 
under pressure to heat treatment, after which 

the dispersion is sprayed out into a low-pressure 
space and is thus depressurized, and 
b) a supporting gas is injected from below into the 
mass-transfer column. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 

that the gas used is introduced in the vicinity of the 
bottom of the reactor. 
A process according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the gas is introduced below the stirrer. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the gas introduction is carried out before the 

nozzle or into the nozzle. 
A process according to claim 1, characterized in 
that the gas is introduced through the stirrer.  

 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the gas is an inorganic or organic 

material which is gaseous at STP. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that the gas utilized is the vapour of 

the blowing agent used. 
A process according to claim 7, characterized in 
that further amounts of the blowing agent are metered in 

as vapour or in liquid form, with the blowing agent 
introduced being preheated if desired. 
A process according to any one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that an ethylene-propylene random 

copolymer containing from 1 to 15% by weight of ethylene 
is used as polyolefin.
