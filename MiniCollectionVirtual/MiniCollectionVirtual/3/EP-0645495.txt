<ABSTRACT>
A cleaning device for water flowing in a sewer (1) and containing dirty material with portions of solid matter. The cleaning device has at least one rack part lying essentially below the water surface and having a separating area (2, 3), through which water can flow and which is effective as a screening area, in combination with a dirt-releasing element (10, 11; 12, 13; 14; 17, 18; 21, 22) movable relative to the rack surface, the dirty material released by the separating area being transported out of the sewer (1) by a conveying device interacting with the dirt-releasing element. The cleaning device is to be improved in such a way that it realizes the performance advantages of the belt screen through which water can flow from inside to outside. This object is achieved in that at least one essentially plane, fixed rack part with a separating area (2, 3) inclined at least in sections to the direction of flow is provided, the receiving part of the conveying device merging into the region of the downstream end of the separating area, and in that the dirt-releasing element is designed to be movable on the separating area.
