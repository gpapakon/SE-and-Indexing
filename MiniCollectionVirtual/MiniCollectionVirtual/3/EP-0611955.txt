An apparatus for investigating the flow motion of
a flow medium within a cylindrical component (2) of a

reciprocating internal combustion engine, wherein the
flow motion is generated by a flow-guiding system (3,

4) located in front of the cylindrical component (2)
when viewed in the direction of flow, characterised in

that at least one hydrometric vane (7) is rotatably
mounted in the cylindrical component (2), which vane is

connected to a shaft (6), the axis of rotation of which
intersects the axis (1) of the cylindrical component

(2) at an adjustable angle which is other than 0Â°, and
that the shaft (6) is connected to an apparatus (20)

for evaluating the rotary frequency of the hydrometric
vane (7) to determine one or more parameters of the

flow motion.
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the cylindrical component (2) is closed in its

axial direction, when viewed in the direction of flow,
after the hydrometric vane (7) or after the hydrometric

vanes (14, 15, 16), and the flow medium entering the
cylindrical component (2) can emerge through at least

one opening (8) in the walls of the cylindrical
component (2), the centre point of which substantially

coincides with the axis of rotation (6) of the
hydrometric vane (7) or the axes of rotation (11, 12,

13) of the hydrometric vanes (14, 15, 16).
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the flow medium entering the cylindrical

component (2) can flow out through a flow-permeable
wall (9) located after the hydrometric vane (7) or

after the hydrometric vanes (14, 15, 16), when viewed
in the direction of flow. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the axis (6) of the hydrometric vane (7) or of

the hydrometric vanes (14, 15, 16) is displaceable
relative to the flow-guiding system (3, 4) in the axial

direction of the cylindrical component (2) and is
rotatable about the axis (1) of the cylindrical

component (2).
An apparatus according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the cylindrical component (2) is closed in its

axial direction, when viewed in the direction of flow,
after the hydrometric vane (7) or after the hydrometric

vanes (14, 15, 16), by a wall (5) impermeable to the
flow which is displaceable in the axial direction of

the component (2).
An apparatus according to Claim 3, characterised
in that the flow-permeable wall (9) which, when viewed

in the direction of flow, is located after the
hydrometric vane (7) or after the hydrometric vanes

(14, 15, 16), is displaceable in the axial direction of
the cylindrical component (2).
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the hydrometric vane (7) or the hydrometric

vanes (14, 15) is or are in the form of a circular
ring.
A method for operating an apparatus for
investigating the flow motion within a cylindrical

component in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in
that the flow passing through the cylindrical component

(2) is a steady flow.
A method for operating an apparatus for
investigating the flow motion within a cylindrical

component in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in 
that the flow passing through the cylindrical component

(2) is a non-steady flow.
