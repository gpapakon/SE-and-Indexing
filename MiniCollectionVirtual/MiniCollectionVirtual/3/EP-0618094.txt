Trailer coupling to connect towing vehicles to 
trailers, the coupling body (3) of which trailer 

coupling with the catch hole (11) and the coupling bolt 
unit (13) has a holding pipe (15) which projects into a 

bearing housing (17), secured to the towing vehicle, 
and which can be rotated in the bearing housing, 

characterized in that the holding pipe (15) can also be 
longitudinally displaced in the bearing housing (17); 

and is connected to a piston pipe (23) with a piston 
step (29), whereby in the bearing housing (17) on both 

sides of the piston step (29) damping-liquid chambers 
(31) are formed which are connected to each other by 

means of at least one damping channel (33) extending in 
the piston step (29). 
Trailer coupling according to claim 1, 
characterized by two stop absorbers (37) which limit 

the working stroke of the piston pipe (23) on both 
sides. 
Trailer coupling according to claim 2, 
characterized in that the stop absorbers (37) are 

rubber-elastic inlays. 
Trailer coupling according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized in that the piston pipe (23) has a stop 

step (27) of larger diameter, the front surfaces of 
which cooperate with the stop absorbers (37) which are 

constructed to be annular, and the piston step (29), 
again of larger diameter, is constructed on the stop 

step (27). 
Trailer coupling according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterized in that the piston 

pipe (23) surrounds a holding pipe (15), which is 
constructed in one piece with the coupling body (3) or 

is firmly connected thereto, and is firmly screwed to 
the holding pipe. 
Trailer coupling according to one or more of  
 

the preceding claims, characterized in that the bearing 
housing consists of two halves (17', 17'') which are 

braced together with an outer tubular jacket (21), 
which is arranged between them, in order to form a 

rigid unit. 
Trailer coupling according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterized by two readjusting 

springs (60) arranged on both sides of a step of the 
piston pipe (23), the readjusting springs being 

supported in the bearing housing (17) with their ends 
which are directed away and loading the piston pipe 

(23) in a readjusting manner into a middle position of 
the working stroke. 
Trailer coupling according to claim 7, 
characterized in that the readjusting springs (60) are 

arranged in the damping-liquid chambers (31) and load 
the piston step (29) on both sides. 
Trailer coupling according to one or more of 
the preceding claims, characterized by a pivot brake 

(40) which counteracts rotations of the coupling body 
(3) and has a brake disc (42) which is connected to the 

coupling body (3) in an axially displaceable and 
rotationally secure manner, the brake disc being 

disposed between brake blocks (44), one of which is 
spring-loaded. 
Trailer coupling according to claim 9, 
characterized in that the pivot brake (40) is arranged 

in front of the bearing housing (17) and has two 
housing halves (46', 46'') in which the brake blocks 

(44) are arranged, and in that the brake disc (42) is 
mounted on the front end of the piston pipe (23) in a 

rotationally secure and axially displaceable manner. 
Trailer coupling according to claim 10, 
characterized in that the bearing-housing halves (17', 

17''), with the outer tubular jacket (21) fixed between 
them, and the pivot-brake housing halves (46', 46'')  

 
are braced by means of tension rods (50), distributed 

evenly on the circumference, such that they form a 
rigid structural unit.
