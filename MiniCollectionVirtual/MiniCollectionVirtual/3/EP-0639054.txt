<ABSTRACT>
High quality protein products are obtained from whey by subjecting whey to cross flow filtration in microfilter. The whey and retentate are brought to circulate in a circulation path on one side of the membrane area of the microfilter, while whey which has passed the membrane area (permeate) is circulating in a second path on the other side of the membrane area in such a way that the pressure drop over the whole membrane area is kept constant and below 0.8 bar. At that there is obtained a fractionation of milk serum protein such that denatured milk serum protein and fat are retained in the retentate and undenatured milk serum protein passes the membrane into the permeate. After an end treatment there is obtained a whey protein product which is rich in  alpha -lactalbumin and  beta -lactoglobulin and has a low fat content.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of obtaining 
high-quality protein products from whey. Whey constitutes the water part which is separated from 
the curd when producing cheese and casein conventionally. 
The whey amounts to 80-90 % of the total amount of 
milk and contains about 50 % of the nutrition in the 
milk i.e. soluble protein, lactose, vitamins and 
mineral substances. The dry solids content (TS) is ∼ 6,3 
% where lactose is 4,85 %, protein 0,8 %, fat 0,5 % and 
salts 0,7 %. Since cheeses have been produced on a large scale it 
has been a problem to dispose of the whey. During a 
certain period the whey was discharged into lakes and 
water courses. Many countries have now forbidden such 
discharges. In order to make use of the nutrition in the 
whey to some extent it has been used as animal feed and 
as fertilizer. For a long time the whey has been considered more as a 
troublesome by-product which must be taken care of than 
as a possible resource. During recent years new 
processes for producing high quality whey products have 
been developed. By evaporation of the whey lactose may 
be obtained, for which the whey proteins must first be 
separated from the whey in many cases. When whey is separated from the curd in connection with 
cheese production it contains small cheese fines which 
are separated e.g in whey strainers. The cheese fines 
are used for manufacture of cheese-like products. After 
the separation of the cheese fines the main part of the 
fat in the whey may separated in a centrifugal 
separator which also separates a further amount of  
 
cheese fines. After separation of fat the whey has a fat 
content of ∼ 0,05 % and may be treated further for 
example in ultrafilters. The proteins which are present 
in the whey are sometimes called whey proteins, or 
sometimes milk-serum proteins, and when the whey is 
separated from the curd the proteins are dissolved in 
the whey. These proteins may be concentrated by 
different methods depending on requirements, 
in particular whether 
they are 
to be extracted in unaffected or heat denatured form. During 
ultrafiltration substances with low molecular weight 
pass through the membrane in the ultrafilter and a 
concentrate is obtained. The permeate which is free from 
protein is an excellent raw material for production of 
lactose. EP-A-0 311 283 discloses a process for obtaining concentrates 
having high alpha-lactalbumin content from whey. Depending on the degree of concentration (removal of 
liquid) different kinds of products

Method of obtaining high quality products from whey, 

characterized in
 that whey is subjected 
to a cross flow filtration in a microfilter, wherein 

supplied whey and retentate are brought to circulate in 
a circulation path on one side of the membrane area of 

the microfilter, and whey which has passed the membrane 
surface (permeate) is circulated in a second circulation 

path on the other side of the membrane area, the filtration 
being being performed in such a way that the pressure drop over the whole 

membrane area is kept constant and the pressure drop 
over the membrane area is below 0.8 x 10
5
 Pa (0.8 bar), and there 
is obtained a fractionation of milk serum protein 

with denatured milk serum protein and fat being 
retained in the retentate while undenatured milk serum 

protein passes the membrane and is present in the 
permeate, whereby after an end treatment of the 

permeate there is obtained a whey protein product rich 
in α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin but with a low fat 

content. 
Method according to claim 1, 
characterized 
in
 that the pore size in the membrane is 0.05 - 1.4 
µm, preferably 0.05-0.7 µm 
Method according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized 
in
 that the flow rate over the membrane area is 
4-10 m/s, preferably 5-8 m/s. 
Method according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterized 
in
 that the pressure drop over the membrane 
surface is below 0.2 x 10
5
 Pa (0.2 bar). 
Method according to any one of claims 1-4, 
characterized  
 

in
 that the cross flow filtration in the 
micro filter is performed over an operation time of 

at least 20 hours with a constant capacity and constant 
passage of protein by control of the transmembrane 

pressure.
