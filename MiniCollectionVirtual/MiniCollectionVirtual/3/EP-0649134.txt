<ABSTRACT>
Input/output processing of information is 
controlled in a magnetooptical disc apparatus for 

recording and/or reproducing the information on a 
magnetooptical recording medium by irradiating a 

desired track of the recording medium with a light beam 
via an optical system. The servo control of the light 

beam such as tracking servo control, focusing servo 
control or the like is performed by causing 

interruption in the input/out processing control. When 
the apparatus activates, a parameter in the servo 

control is set on the basis of a reproduction signal 
amplitude of the information with a change in state of 

the servo control and a parameter in signal processing 
of the information is set in accordance with a 

reproduction signal amplitude of the information 
corresponding to the set parameter for the servo 

control.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetooptical
disc apparatus for at least recording or reproducing
information on or from a magnetooptical recording
medium by irradiating a track of the recording medium
with a light beam emitted from a light source and
applying an external magnetic field.A conventional magnetooptical disc apparatus
generally has an arrangement like the one shown in
Fig. 1 ("Magnetooptical Disc Apparatus", Oki Denki
Technical Report, 148, Vol. 57, No. 4). This disc
apparatus comprises a drive unit, a control unit, and a
power source. The drive unit is constituted by an
optical head (an actuator 12 and an optical system 14
including a light source, a detector, an objective
lens, and the like) for recording and/or reproducing
information on/from a disc, a signal processing unit 15
for mainly performing modulation of externally
transferred data in a recording operation and
detection/demodulation of data read out from a disc, a
servo control unit 22, a medium loading/ejecting
mechanism 10, a disc rotating mechanism 9, and a first 
micro-processor 23 for controlling the drive unit. The
control unit is constituted by a drive control unit 21
for controlling data transfer from/to the drive unit
and the operation of the drive unit, an ECC processing
unit 31 for performing error correction of data, a
buffer control unit 30 for controlling a data buffer,
an SCSI controller 1, and a second micro-processor 20.In such a conventional magnetooptical disc
apparatus, however, micro-processors are required for
the drive unit and the control unit, respectively. In
addition, although not shown in Fig. 1, the two
processors respectively require memories for storing
programs and variables. Such memories are also
required for the drive unit and the control unit,
respectively. Furthermore, the drive control unit 21
is required to smoothly control the control unit and
the drive unit.As described above, the conventional
magnetooptical disc apparatus requires
micro-processors, memories, and a drive control unit.
Therefore, the disc apparatus is expensive and it is
difficult to reduce it in size. EP-A-0 600 497 discloses a disk drive for a magnetic
disk including a servo control unit for accessing the
required portion of the disk. A single processor is used
to control the servo operation and the data input/output
by periodically interrupting the servo control.EP-A-0 626 687 discloses an optical disk apparatus
including a servo control means for controlling the
position of the light beam on the disk in response
