<ABSTRACT>
The germicidal efficiency of an aqueous disinfectant cleaning composition is increased by incorporating an effective amount of a compound of the formula (I): R-O(-G)n wherein R is an alkyl group having from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, G is a saccharide residue having 5 or 6 carbon atoms; and n is a number from 1 to 10 into an aqueous composition which contains a compound of the formula (II): R2R3R4R5NX, wherein R2 is a benzyl or C1-4 alkyl substituted benzyl group, and each of R3, R4, and R5 is independently an alkyl group having from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD FOR INCREASING THE EFFICIENCY OF A DISINFECTANTCLEANING COMPOSITIONBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a method for increasing the efficiency of a germicidal cleaning composition. 2. Description of the Related ArtInvestigations into the microbiological activities of alkyl glycosides have shown that they exhibit no significant antimicrobial activity even at concentrations as high as 10,000 ppm. Furthermore, combinations of alkyl glycosides with quaternary ammonium compounds are similarly undistinguished in their antimicrobial effect. While quaternary ammonium compounds exhibit bactericidal activity, their use with an alkyl glycoside surfactant, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,547,828, produces no increased or unexpected bactericidal effect. U.S. 4,748,158 teaches the use of alkyl glycosides as potentiating agents for increasing the microbicidal activity of bactericidally active biguanide compounds, especially microbicidal activity against gram-positive bacteria, in antiseptic preparations. U.S. 4,834,903 teaches composition in which the above-described oxyalkylated long chain glycoside composition is utilized 

in combination with one or more anionic, cationic or nonionic cosurfactant ingredients and/or with one or more detergent builder components.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been found that the germicidal efficiency of an aqueous disinfectant cleaning composition can be increased by incorporating an effective amount of a compound of the formula IR-0(-G)n I wherein R is an alkyl group having from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, G is a saccharide residue having 5 or 6 carbon atoms; and n is a number from 1 to 10 into an aqueous composition which contains a compound of the formula II R2R3R4R5NX wherein R2 is an alkyl group having from about 1 to about 22 carbon atoms, a benzyl or C1-4 alkyl substituted benzyl group, and each of R3, R4, and R5 is independently an alkyl group having from about 1 to about 22 carbon atoms and X is a halide.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Other than in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients or reaction conditions used herein are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about".Compounds of the formula I are commercial surfactants and are available, for example, from Henkel Corporation, Ambler, PA., 19002 under the trademark names APG®, Plantaren™, or Glucopon™. Examples of such surfactants include but are not limited
