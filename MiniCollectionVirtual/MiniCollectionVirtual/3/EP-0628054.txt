<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to receptors, particularly nuclear hormone receptors.It is known from Fuller (FASEB J., 1991, 5:3092-3099), that the steroid receptor
superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors is characterized by marked
conservation of both structure and function between the various receptors. Despite
their well-documented extensive similarities, these receptors respond to a diverse
range of ligands, which results in an even more impressive diversity of function. A
variety of strategies is used at each point in the pathway from ligand binding to gene
expression to achieve this diversity. The nature of the ligand is important as are the
tissue-specific patterns of receptor gene expression, the presence of binding
proteins, and the effects of cell- or tissue-specific-ligand-modifying enzymes. Once
bound to the receptor, the nature of which may vary as a result of either differential
splicing or gene duplication yielding multiple isoforms, the activated receptor may
form hetero- or homodimers. A complex interplay then occurs between the receptor
dimer, other nuclear proteins, the response element, and the promoter complex to
regulate gene expression. These elements may vary as a function of the cell type,
other stimuli, and the context and sequence of the response element (or elements)
in a given gene. By these mechanisms diversity may even be achieved for a given
ligand, receptor subtype, gene, or cell. The observations may help to explain certain
phenomena in hormone biology that are difficult to reconcile with the previous,
simple, univariant model of steroid hormone action.In higher organisms, the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily includes
approximately a dozen distinct genes that encode zinc finger transcription factors,
each of which is specifically activated by binding a ligand such as a steroid, thyroid
hormone (T3) or retinoic acid (RA). However, there is an additional, somewhat 
larger group of cDNAs that encodes proteins that do not bind or respond to any
known ligand. These members of the superfamily are called orphan receptors. While
the role of the better characterized conventional receptors in regulating important
processes in developing and adult individuals is becoming clearer, the function of
the orphan receptors has been uncertain.A number of the conventional and orphan members of the superfamily share
identical or very similar amino acid sequences in an important region of the first zinc
finger. Both genetic analyses and X-ray crystallography indicate that this
