<ABSTRACT>
A stripline resonator is constructed of a dielectric 
plate having a ground electrode formed on a side 

surface thereof, an open-ended 位/2 long stripline arranged 
on a top surface of the dielectric plate, an input 

terminal to which signals are inputted, said input 
terminal is connected to one end of the open-ended 位/2 

long stripline, a first reactance element connected either 
in series or in parallel between the input terminal 

and the open-ended 位/2 long stripline, and a second 
reactance element connected at one end thereof to an 

opposite end of the open-ended 位/2 long stripline and 
at an opposite end to a ground electrode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an open-ended
stripline resonator comprising a stripline, a ground
electrode, a first reactance coupled to one end of the
stripline and a second reactance coupled between the
other end of the stripline and the ground electrode.A conventional stripline resonator, as disclosed
in JP-A-03-073602, is illustrated in FIG. 16.
Referring to FIG. 16, the conventional stripline
resonator is described. A side surface 104 and a bottom
surface 105 of a dielectric plate 101 are metallized or
plated over the entire surfaces thereof. The metallized
or plated side surface 104 and bottom surface 105 are
electrically maintained at the ground potential. A
stripline resonator 103 is formed on a top surface 102
of the dielectric plate 101. The stripline resonator
103 is connected at one end thereof to an input
terminal 108. At an area on the top surface 102, said
area being apart by a predetermined distance from an
opposite end of the stripline resonator 103, a marginal
portion 106 is formed in such a way that the marginal
portion is plated in continuation with the side surface
104. The opposite end of the stripline resonator 103
is connected to the marginal portion 106 via a lumped-constant
element such as a capacitor 107.As a consequence, capacitance C is realized
between the opposite end of the stripline resonator 103
and the side surface 104 which forms a ground
electrode, whereby the stripline resonator 103 is
equipped with an increased quality factor Q.GB-A-2223371 discloses a stripline resonator
having a reactance of each end.US-A-5057803 discloses a multi-layer stripline
device. Reactances are located on upper and lower
substrates in respective embodiment. However, the
positions of the reactances in both embodiments are
identical.An object of the present invention is to provide a
stripline resonator which requires a small mounting
area.According to the present invention, there is
provided a stripline resonator characterized in that 
the stripline is formed on a first dielectric
substrate, and the first and second reactances and
ground electrodes are supported on a second dielectric
substrate, the first and second substrates being
stacked to form a multilayer structure and the first
reactance and/or the second reactance being positioned
in a manner not the possible on the first dielectric
substrate due to the presence of the stripline.Owing to the construction described above, the
stripline resonator according to the present invention
requires
only a small mounting area.Embodiments of
