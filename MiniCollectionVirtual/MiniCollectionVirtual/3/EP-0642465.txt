<DESCRIPTION>
 SYSTEM FOR NITROGEN OXIDES REDUCTION TO LOWEST ACHIEVABLE LEVELTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a system for reducing nitrogen oxides (N0χ, where x is a positive integer, generally 1 of 2) in the effluent from the combustion of a carbonaceous fuel. The inventive system avoids the application of fruitless and counterproductive NOχ-reducing treatment processes. It also enables the practitioner to achieve nitrogen oxides reductions in situations previously thought infeasible.Nitrogen oxides are troublesome pollutants which are found in the combustion effluent streams of boilers and comprise a major irritant in smog. It is further believed that nitrogen oxides can undergo a process in the troposhere known as photo-chemical smog formation through a series of reactions in the presence of sunlight and hydrocarbons. Moreover, nitrogen oxides comprise a significant contributor to acid rain and have been implicated in the depletion of the ozone layer of the stratosphere. Nitrogen oxides may also be a contributor to the undesirable warming of the atmosphere known as the "greenhouse effect". 

 Efforts have long been under way to develop selective, non-catalytic nitrogen oxides reduction (SNCR) processes because of the efficiency and economy of such processes. Non-catalytic processes often have the drawback, though, of being extremely temperature dependent and were long believed to be non-applicable in "high temperature" applications, such as in situations where the temperature of the effluent being treated is above 2100°F. In such situations, it had been thought that only burner modifications (which are limited in usefulness) could be used to reduce N0χ when the temperatures are so high. Due to boiler geometry and other considerations, it is often possible to introduce treatment agents only in selected locations in a boiler. If such locations are at temperatures where commonly used nitrogen oxides processes were considered infeasible, it was believed that significant NOχ reductions could not be achieved.What is desired, therefore, is a system whereby nitrogen oxides reductions can be achieved even in situations where they were thought infeasible, such as at temperatures above 2100°F, as well as a system whereby the introduction of N0χ reducing treatment agents in counterproductive situations can be avoided.Background ArtProcesses and compositions for the reduction of nitrogen oxides in combustion effluents have been developed extensively over recent years. With the increased attention to the health
