<DESCRIPTION>
 PROCESS FOR ACETYLATION OF CELLULOSEThis invention relates to a process for acetylation of cellulose wherein the cellulose is subjected to high agitation for a short period of time.Typically cellulose acetate is prepared by a process wherein wood pulp is acetylated to cellulose triacetate and the cellulose triacetate is then hydrolyzed to cellulose diacetate, which is often simply called cellulose acetate. The cellulose acetate is then recovered and used to prepare fibers or molded objects.In accordance with processes well known in the art, the acetylation step can be conducted by taking mechanically sub—divided units of a sheet of wood pulp which have been contacted with acetic materials in a prior activation step and contacting the activated wood pulp with acetic acid, acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid for a sufficient period of time for the wood pulp to fully esterify to cellulose triacetate.• Although the acetylation processes of the prior art are effective in producing a properly acetylated cellulose, these processes require relatively long periods of time. For example, the acetylation processes of the prior art typically require times of thirty minutes and often require times of more that one hour. Due to the time value of capital, it would be very desirable to reduce the time required to conduct the acetylation process. We have now discovered a process for the acetylation of cellulose which can be conducted in an extremely short period of time compared to the processes of the prior art. We have accomplished the objective of conducting the acetylation process in a very short time by subjecting the acetylation composition to a high agitation. 

 In summary, our invention can be thought of as a process comprising(A) introducing cellulose, water, acetic acid, a catalyst and acetic anhydride into an acetylation zone,(B) subjecting the materials within the acetylation zone to an activation which is in the range of 0.01 to 2.0 kilowatts per pound of the materials for a period of time of less than 10 seconds.As described above, the first step of the process of this invention broadly comprises introducing cellulose, water, acetic acid, a catalyst and acetic anhydride into an acetylation zone in one stream. In a preferred embodiment, these materials are introduced into the acetylation zone in two steams. In this embodiment, the first two steps of the process can be described as(A) introducing into an acetylation zone a first stream comprising cellulose, water, a portion of the total acetic acid and a
