<ABSTRACT>
Mechanically filtered environmental air is normally passed, by means of fans (15) which are arranged on the rotor shaft on both sides, through the cooling channels in the stator and rotor and the machine airgap (22) it order to cool a rotating electrical machine having an open cooling circuit. If the air which is taken from the environment is contaminated with hazardous materials, it is proposed to supply the prefiltered air directly to the stator and to the machine air gap and to subject only that cooling air which is to be supplied to the rotor to secondary filtering in an active-carbon filter (30). In this case, the mechanically filtered cooling air which is to be supplied to the stator and, if appropriate, to the machine air gap, is conveyed by the fans, while the cooling air which is subjected to secondary filtering and is to be supplied to the rotor is passed into the rotor on a separate path. In this case, the cooling air for the rotor is preferably conveyed by the rotor's own fan. This reduces the investment costs for the secondary filters, since only a fraction of the required quantity of air now needs to be subjected to secondary filtering.

Method for cooling an air-cooled rotating 
electrical machine having an open cooling circuit, in 

the case of which mechanically filtered environmental 
air is passed through the cooling ducts (9a, 11a) in 

the stator (9) and rotor (11) and the machine air gap 
(22) by means of fans (15) which are arranged at both 

ends of the rotor shaft and, after this, is emitted to 
the environment again, characterized in that the 

mechanically filtered air is supplied directly to the 
stator (9) and to the machine air gap (22), and in that 

only the cooling air which is to be supplied to the 
rotor (11) is subjected to refiltering, the 

mechanically filtered cooling air which is to be 
supplied to the stator and possibly to the machine air 

gap being passed through the fans, while the cooling 
air which is to be supplied to the rotor is passed into 

the rotor on a separate route. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the cooling air for the rotor (11) is conveyed by 

the rotor's own ventilation. 
Air-cooled rotating electrical machine having 
an open cooling circuit, having a rotor which is 

provided with cooling ducts (11a), having a laminated 
stator core (9) which is provided with cooling ducts 

(9) [sic], having a machine housing (5), outer casings 

(2) on the two housing ends, fans (15) on each end of 
the shaft of the rotor (11), which fans pass cooling 

air, which is filtered by a mechanical filter (18), 
through chambers (21) on the machine ends into the 

machine interior, which chambers are separated from the 
machine interior by second inner casings (4), 

characterized in that the said chambers are divided by 
a first inner casing (3), the first chamber (31), which 

is formed essentially by the outer casing (2) and the 
first inner casing (3), being capable of supplying 

refiltered cooling air directly to the rotor bypassing 

the fan (15), in that the second chamber (21), which is 
formed essentially by the first inner casing (3) and  

 
the second inner casing (4), can be supplied only with 

the prefiltered cooling air, and in that means (36) are 
provided for separating the outlet flow space (23) of 

the fan (15) from the rotor space (37). 
Machine according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that ducts (33; 43) are provided underneath the fan 

(15) in order to connect the first chamber (31) to the 
rotor space (37). 
Machine according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the fan (15) is mounted on a shaft collar (33) and 

the ducts are formed by through-holes (34), which run 
approximately axially, in the shaft collar (33). 
Machine according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the ducts are formed by passages (43) in the rotor 

shaft. 
Machine according to one of Claims 3 to 6, 
[lacuna]
 in that the rotor space (37) is separated from 
the outlet flow space (23) of the fan (15) by means of 

a first cylindrical cover (36), which is preferably 
mounted on the cap plate (35) of the rotor cap (12).
