<ABSTRACT>
A catheter formed of an elongated shaft (35) with a dilatation balloon (25) at the distal end includes a guide wire lumen (50) external to the balloon (25). The guidewire lumen (50) extends from the distal tip of the catheter (5) to a proximal port distal from the proximal end of the catheter (5). The shaft (35) is formed of a proximal hypotube (90) and a distal spring coil (15). In some embodiments, the wire lumen (50) extends the full length of the catheter and includes apertures (75) for drug delivery or perfusion. A core wire (10) is included to enhance the pushability of the catheter and support the balloon (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to over-the-wire catheters 
and particularly, to rapid exchange and perfusion catheters. The technique of eliminating a vascular stenosis by 
dilating a balloon on a catheter placed within the stenosis 
was developed by Dr. Andreas Gruntzig. The first marketable 
catheters for angioplasty were "fixed wire" catheters, in 
which a core or guide wire was fixed within the catheter to 
stiffen it so that it could be pushed into position in the 
vascular system. Dr. John Simpson and Dr. Edward Robert subsequently 
developed an "over-the-wire" catheter in which a guidewire was 
slidably placed within a lumen of the catheter. The guidewire 
lumen passed from the distal end of the catheter through the 
balloon to the proximal end of the catheter. This system 
provided reasonably easy placement of the catheter because the 
small, flexible guidewire was first positioned beyond the 
stenosis and the catheter was then slid into place over it. 
Such over-the-wire catheters are generally coaxial (the 
guidewire lumen is centered within the inflation lumen) or 
biaxial or bilumen (the guidewire lumen is parallel to the 
inflation lumen). Biaxial versions generally slide better 
over the guidewire than coaxial versions.  
 More recently, "rapid exchange" catheters have been 
developed with shorter guidewire lumens passing from the 
distal end of the catheter through the balloon and opening to 
the exterior of the catheter somewhere proximal to the 
balloon; they make catheter exchange over the guidewire easier 
to accomplish. Various versions of rapid exchange catheters, either 
coaxial or biaxial, are shown in the following patents: U.S. 
Patent No. 4,762,129 issued to Bonzel, U.S. Patent Nos. 
5,040,548 and 5,061,273 issued to Yock, U.S. Patent No. 
4,748,982 issued to Horzewski, et al., U.S. Patent No. 
4,988,356 issued to Crittenden and U.S. Patent No. 5,135,532 
issued to Kramer. In the Horzewski and Crittenden device, the 
guidewire lumen contains a slit extending along its length (except 
where it passes through the balloon) so that the guidewire can 
be removed from the lumen through the slit at a point 
immediately proximal to the balloon. Examples of rapid 
exchange catheters on the market are ACS' Alpha™ catheter, 
ACS' RX™ catheter, Schneider's Piccolino™ and SciMed's 
Express™ catheter. Although the above catheters have significantly improved 
and streamlined the angioplasty process, they still leave room 
for improvement. For example, visualizing the location of the
