<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a facade construction having at least one load-bearing profile (1) and at least one facade element mounted in a sealing manner on the load-bearing profile (1), and in particular in the form of a glass element (5a,b), provision being made, in order to mount the facade element, for an essentially double-T-shaped, elastic connection profile (33) which is fastened on one side of the load-bearing profile (1) and comprises a room-side glazing profile (2), an outer glazing profile (4) and a web profile (3) which connects the two glazing profiles (2, 4) to one another, the facade element being retained between the two glazing profiles (2, 4) at the border. In the case of such a facade construction, the glass or facade elements are secured against falling out in that additional provision is made in the connection profile (33), at predetermined locations thereof, for individual securing elements which retain the facade element on the load-bearing profile (1) even if the outer glazing profile (4) cannot exert its retaining function or cannot exert said function sufficiently.
