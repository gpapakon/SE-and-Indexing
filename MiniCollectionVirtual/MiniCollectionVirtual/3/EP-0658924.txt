<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electron-emitting
device, an electron source and an image-forming
apparatus comprising such devices and, more
particularly, it relates to a method of manufacturing
an electron-emitting device.There have been known two types of electron-emitting
device; the thermoelectron type and the cold
cathode type. Of these, the cold cathode type include
the field emission type and the metal/insulation
layer/metal type and the surface conduction type.A surface conduction electron-emitting device is
realized by utilizing the phenomenon that electrons are
emitted out of a small thin film formed on a substrate
when an electric current is forced to flow in parallel
with the film surface. A surface conduction electron-emitting
device is typically prepared by arranging a
pair of device electrodes on an insulating substrate
and an electroconductive film, which may be a metal
oxide film, between the electrodes to electrically
connecting them and subjecting the thin film to an
electrically energizing process referred to as 
"electric forming" to locally deform or modify the thin
film and produce therein an electron-emitting region.A surface conduction electron-emitting device is a
device that shows a sudden and sharp increase in the
emission current Ie when the voltage applied thereto
exceeds a certain level (a threshold voltage), whereas
the emission current is practically undetectable when
the applied voltage is found lower than the threshold.
Because of this remarkable feature, the emission
current of the device can be controlled through the
device voltage while the emission charge can be
controlled through the duration of time of applying the
device voltage. A variety of image-forming apparatuses
can be produced, using in combination an electron
source realized by arranging a plurality of surface
conduction electron-emitting devices and a phosphorous
body designed to emit visible light when irradiated
with electrons coming from the electron source. With
this technique, emissive type display apparatuses
having a large display screen capable of displaying
high quality images can be produced without difficulty.
Hence, such apparatuses are expected to replace CRTs in
the future.Materials that can be used for the
electroconductive film of a surface conduction
electron-emitting device include, besides metal oxides,
metal and carbon. When a metal oxide is used, an 
organic metal compound is applied to the substrate to
form an initial thin film of the compound and then
baked in the atmosphere to
