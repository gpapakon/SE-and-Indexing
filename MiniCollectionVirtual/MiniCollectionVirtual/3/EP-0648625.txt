<ABSTRACT>
Existing stabilisers for motor vehicles act in such a way that as opposing wheel movement on one and the same axle increases, the force constantly increases, which with rigid stabilisers greatly restricts the twisting of the vehicle. With the variable tension and compression rods according to the invention, the effect of the stabiliser on the necessary roll forces can be limited. If larger wheel movements are necessary, the force does not continue to increase, that is the spring elements (4) act as a type of pressure relief valve.
