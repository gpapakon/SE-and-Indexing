<ABSTRACT>
A semi-active secondary suspension comprises a relatively 
large actuator (230) for handling low-frequency forces such as 

those caused by uneven passenger distribution, etc., by 
means, for example, of a position control loop. A pair of 

such suspensions on opposite sides of the car or rail can 
be made to act in concert, for example, by actuating only 

one at a time. An inner loop can be added to the position 
control for each secondary suspension to restore its actuator 

to a selected preload position when not being used as an 
actuator. The semi-active secondary suspension is made 

fully active by adding a relatively small actuator (120) for 
handling higher frequency dynamic forces. A roller guide 

embodiment has rollers (100) pivotally mounted on links which are 
spring-biased toward the rail blades. The relatively large 

actuators (230) are connected to the link springs (232) to slowly 
increase or decrease the preload force on the spring (232) acting 

on the links (102b) to counter low frequency disturbances. The 
relatively small actuators (120) also act on the links (102b) to ensure 

that high frequency disturbances are quickly countered 
thereby ensuring a substantially vibration-free ride. 

Suspensions comprising slide guides, electromagnets, etc. 
are shown.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to elevators and, more
particularly, to horizontal suspensions and control systems
therefor.An elevator cab assembly will typically comprise a
passenger cab which is mounted in a rectangular frame. The
cab assembly moves up and down in the elevator hoistway along
guide rails which are mounted on opposite walls of the
hoistway.Japanese Kokai Publication No. 3-23185, published
January 31, 1991, discloses a system for stabilizing an
elevator cab as it is moving along guide rails in a hoistway,
which guide rails possess a varying compliancy. The system
includes transverse beams above and below the cab assembly
which are adjustably moveable relative to the cab assembly.
Rail guides are mounted on the ends of the transverse beams
by means of vibration-proof rubber pads. The beams are also
connected to the cab assembly by vibration-proof rubber pads.
A contoured guide piece is fixed to the hoistway wall which
mimics the compliancy values of the rails, and contact
sensors are mounted on the beams to slide over the guide
piece. Motion of the contact sensors is monitored by a
control which operates actuators operable to laterally shift
the beams in response to movement of the contact sensors.
The rail guide will thus be moved laterally relative to the
cab assembly as the rail compliancy varies. A problem found
in this teaching concerns the fact that if the beam is moved
to the left to shift the left-hand rail guides in response
to variations in compliancy of the left-hand rail, then the
right-hand rail guides must necessarily move in the same
direction as the left-hand rail guides. The objective of
moving the rail guides toward a rail as rail compliancy
increases, and away from the rail as rail compliancy
decreases is thus only attainable on one of the rails, and 
the opposite rail guide movement occurs at the other opposite
side rail. The use of the guide piece is also cumbersome,
and its ability to mirror rail compliancy is problematic,
at best. Kokai 3-51280, published 5 March 1991, shows other
aspects of the same system.Another approach shown in Kokai 3-51279, published
5 March 1991, uses actuable horizontal ropes strung on
pulleys from corner to corner on diagonals across the cab's
roof and converging at a point above the cab to control the
tilt of the cab.Still another approach is shown in UK Patent
Publication GB 2238404 A, published May 29, 1991, showing
apparatus for maintaining a force applied from the guide
rails to guiding devices constant in correspondence with an
output of a
