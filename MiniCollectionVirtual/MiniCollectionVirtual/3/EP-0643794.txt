<ABSTRACT>
A method of creating a wellbore in an underground formation is provided, the method comprising drilling a borehole (1) in the underground formation (3), lowering a casing (5) of a malleable material into the borehole, said casing being radially expansible against the borehole wall upon application of a radial load (7) and having a smaller elastic radial deformation than the surrounding formation upon application of said load. The radial load is applied to the casing thereby radially expanding the casing against the borehole wall so as to induce a compressive force between the casing and the surrounding formation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of creating a wellbore in an 
underground formation, for example a wellbore for the production of 
oil or gas. Generally, when a wellbore for oil or gas production is 
created, a number of casings are installed in the borehole to 
prevent collapse of the borehole wall and to prevent undesired 
outflow of drilling fluid into the formation or inflow of fluid from 
the formation into the borehole. The borehole is drilled in 
intervals whereby each casing is installed after drilling a next 
interval, so that a next casing to be installed is to be lowered 
through a previously installed casing. In a conventional method of 
creating a wellbore the outer diameter of the next casing is limited 
by the inner diameter of the previously installed casing in order to 
allow lowering of the next casing through the previous casing. Thus, 
the casings are nested relative to each other, with casing diameters 
decreasing in downward direction. Cement annuli are provided between 
the outer surfaces of the casings and the borehole wall to seal the 
casings from the borehole wall. As a consequence of the nested 
arrangement of the casings, a relatively large borehole diameter is 
required at the upper part of the wellbore. Such a large borehole 
diameter involves increased costs due to heavy casing handling 
equipment, large drill bits and increased volumes of drilling fluid. 
Moreover, increased drilling rig time is involved due to required 
cement pumping and cement hardening. US-A-1 233 888 discloses a method of creating a wellbore in an 
underground formation, comprising drilling a borehole in the 
underground formation, lowering a casing of a malleable material 
into the borehole and radially expanding said casing against the 
borehole wall by applying a radial load to the casing and removing 
said load from the casing.  
 It is an object of the invention to provide a method of 
creating a wellbore in an underground formation, which method 
eliminates the need for a relatively large borehole diameter in the 
upper part of the wellbore and which method provides adequate 
sealing between the casing and the underground formation. In accordance with the invention there is provided a method of 
creating a wellbore in an underground formation, comprising drilling 
a borehole in the underground formation, lowering a casing of a 
malleable material into the borehole and radially expanding said 
casing against the borehole wall by applying a radial load to the 
casing and removing said load

<CLAIMS>
A method of creating a wellbore in an underground formation, 
comprising drilling a borehole (1) in the underground formation (3), 

lowering a casing (5) of a malleable material into the borehole (1) 
and radially expanding said casing (5) against the borehole wall (4) 

by applying a radial load to the casing (5) and removing said load 
from the casing, characterized in that the radial load is selected 

so that the casing (5) has a smaller elastic radial deformation than 

the surrounding formation (3) upon application of said load, thereby 
inducing a compressive force between the casing (5) and the 

surrounding formation (3) after removing said load. 
The method of claim 1, wherein said material of the casing (5) 
is capable of sustaining a plastic deformation of at least 25% uni-axial 

strain. 
The method of claim 1 or 2, wherein said casing (5) forms an 
intermediate casing located between a surface casing arranged in an 

upper part of the wellbore and a production casing arranged in a 
lower part of the wellbore. 
The method of one of claims 1-3, wherein a sealing material in 
a fluidic state is pumped between the casing (5) and the borehole 

wall (4) prior to applying said radial load to the casing (5). 
The method of one of claims 1-4, wherein at least part of said 
radial load is applied to the casing (5) by moving an expander (22) 

through the casing (5), which expander (22) has a larger outer 
diameter than the inner diameter of the casing (5). 
The method of claim 5, wherein said expander (22) is provided 
with rollers which are capable of rolling along the inner surface of 

the casing (5), when the expander (22) is rotated, and the step of 
applying the radial load comprises simultaneously rotating the 

expander (22) and moving the expander (22) through the casing (5).  
 
The method of claim 5 or 6, wherein an internal pressure is 
applied to the casing when the expander (22) is moved through the 

casing (5) so as to promote radial expansion of the casing (5). 
The method of one of claims 1-4, wherein at least part of said 
radial load is applied to the casing (5) by locating a hydraulic 

expansion tool (7) in the casing (5) and expanding said tool (7). 
The method of one of claims 1-8, wherein the casing (5) is 
heated during radial expansion thereof. 
The method of one of claims 1-9, wherein said casing (5) is 
stored on a reel before being lowered into the borehole (1) and 

unreeled from the reel during lowering into the borehole (1). 
The method of one of claims 1-10, wherein said casing (5) is 
used as a drill string during drilling of the borehole (1).
