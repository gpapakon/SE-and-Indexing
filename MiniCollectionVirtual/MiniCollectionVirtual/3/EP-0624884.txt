<ABSTRACT>
The present invention discloses diffraction gratings 
which do not generate any thermal strain and can 

perform extremely high-precision and high-efficiency 
diffraction substantially free from scattered beams. 

The diffraction gratings are built by allowing the 
chemically deposited film of silicon carbide whose 

crystal planes are strongly oriented to the (220) 
planes in terms of Miller indices to form on the 

substrate cosmprising sintered silicon carbide, 
polishing the surface of the deposited film to 5Å RMS 

or less, and directly etched laminar-type grating 
grooves on that surface by using ion-beam etching.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the diffraction gratings which are suited for a 
spectrometric element primarily in the soft x-ray region. Conventionally, the following types of diffraction grating are generally 
known: 1 ○ gratings designed to disperse beams by the diffraction effects caused 
by Bragg reflections making the best use of the atomic plane spacing "a" in the 
singie silicon crystal, 2 ○ gratings made by directly etching a large number of 
equally spaced grooves on a quartz substrate by using holographic exposure 
technique and ion-beam etching method, and 3 ○ gratings made by coating Au or Pt 
on the quartz substrate and mechanically ruling a large number of equally 
spaced grooves on the Au- or Pt-coated layer with a ruling apparatus. However, with respect to method 1 ○, since the lattice constant (grating 
constant) "a" in the crystalline is limited, no efficient beam dispersion takes 
place against soft x-rays with wavelength about 1 - 10 nm (10 - 100Å). Furthermore, due to 
its low heat conductivity, silicon tends to give rise to thermal strain against 
high-intensity x-rays such as SR beams, posing problems in strength. In 
diffraction gratings using quartz substrate, both gratings 2 ○ and 3 ○ can be 
used in the range of soft x-ray but provide insufficient thermal conductivity, 
generating thermal strain against x-rays with high intensity such as SR beams 
and exhibiting deterioration of light dispersing capabilities. Therefore, the inventor developed diffraction gratings by forming 
chemically deposited film of silicon carbide (hereinafter called "CVD-SiC 
film") on the substrate comprising sintered silicon carbide, polishing the 
surface of this deposited film, and ruling grating grooves by using etching such 
as ion etching, ion-beam etching, and chemical etching. With the developed 
diffraction gratings, since grating grooves are formed on the CVD-SiC film 
surface by using etching, the grating constant "a" can be freely set and 
problems of defective spectral diffraction in the above-mentioned soft x-ray 
region can be solved. Moreover, because the CVD-SiC film provides more 
excellent heat resistance and thermal conductivity than silicon, it does not 
give rise to thermal strain against high-intensity x-rays nor produces any 
problem in strength. However, since the CVD-SiC film generally has the crystal planes free from 
orientation as shown in Figure 4 or exhibits weak orientation to the (111) 
planes in terms of Miller indices, when grating grooves are formed by using  
 
etching,
