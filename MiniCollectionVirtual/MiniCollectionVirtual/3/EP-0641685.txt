<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for securing the transportation by lorry of receptacles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), designed as containers, so as to prevent the receptacles from slipping on the lorry during the journey. To this end, it is provided that   - at least two retaining supports (13, 14) are attached in such a manner to a retaining frame that said retaining supports face each other in pairs and inbetween form a space for holding the receptacle in a form-fitting manner, - the receptacle can be inserted into the space between the retaining supports and - the retaining frame is connected to the particular supporting surface of the lorry for transportation by water, on dry land or in the air.

<CLAIMS>
Device for securing the transportation of at least one container (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) by
goods vehicle against slippage of the container (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) on the goods vehicle

during the journey, with at least two supports (33 to 42) being fitted to a
superstructure on the vehicle and standing in the vehicle's longitudinal direction

and/or cross-wise to it and/or oblique to it, i.e. diagonally opposite, and receiving
the container (1 to 5) between them, and the container (1 to 5) being located

between supports (33 to 42),
characterized in that
the supports (33 to 42) are fitted on a holding frame,
the container (1 to 5) is to be put in place in the holding frame between
the supports from above, by means of a mobile crane, and is held in the

desired position solely through its weight,
the container is designed as a shipping container which tapers in a
downwards direction, with a collar in the area of its upper end, and
the holding frame is connected with the respective transport surface of the
goods vehicle on water, on land or in the air.
Device in accordance with claim 1, characterized in that the holding frame is
formed from holding profiles (43 to 48) which run in the vehicle's longitudinal

direction and cross-wise to it, and which are fixed to the supports (33 to 42), to
form a frame, for the container to be placed therein.
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
outer walls (52, 53) of the goods vehicle serve as supports.
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that cross
beams (43 to 47) can be placed on the outer walls (52, 53) of the goods vehicle

and can be fixed to them, and that the containers (1 to 5) can be placed in
between [the cross beams]
. 
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
longitudinal beams, for example at least one central longitudinal beam (48), can

be placed on the end walls of the goods vehicle, and fixed on them.
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
container (1 to 5) is to be carried hanging in the intermediate area on the

boundary supports by a bearing surface, for example a collar (6), located on the
container, in such a way that the base of the container (1 to 5) is just clear of the

floor of the fixing frame or of the bearing surface, or the loading area of the
goods vehicle.
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
container (1 to 5) is to be stored standing in the intermediate area on the floor

of the fixing frame or of the bearing surface or of the loading area of the goods
vehicle, in such a way that a collar (6) located on the container (1 to 5) is just

clear of the upper edges of the boundary supports.
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that a
grate-like cage is provided at a distance above the bearing surface of a road

vehicle, this [frame] consisting of several cross-supports (43 to 47), a central

longitudinal beam (48), and one side beam on each of the two longitudinal sides
of the transport device, and that containers (1 to 5) designed as shipping

containers (1 to 5) are to be used in the intermediate areas between the cross-supports
(43 to 47), the central longitudinal beam (48), and the side beams.
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
above the central longitudinal beam (48), spacing profiles (64 to 68) are provided

in the areas of the cross-supports (43 to 47).
Device in accordance with one of the preceding claims, characterized in that
below the longitudinal supports, securing profiles (56 to 60) are provided.
