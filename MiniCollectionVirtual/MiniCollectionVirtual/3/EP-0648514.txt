<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes a configuration for generating multiphase shocks by a single capacitor, using an H bridge with four switches for connecting an energy storage capacitor to a load with a determinable polarity. It consists in connecting the negative side of the shock generator to a supply voltage which is negative with respect to the stimulation earth, and in connecting the positive terminal of the battery to the same earth. This configuration makes it possible to activate the switches on the lower side of the H bridge, the stimulation/detection circuits and the control circuits from negative supplies derived without inversion from the negative terminal of the battery.
