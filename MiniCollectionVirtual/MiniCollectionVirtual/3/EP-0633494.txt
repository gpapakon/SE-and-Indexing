<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of
making a silver halide photographic emulsion comprising
hexagonal tabular grains having a uniform hexagonal form
and an excellent monodispersibility. The present invention
further relates to a process of making a silver halide
photographic material which contains the above emulsion.
Such a silver halide photographic material is characterized
by an excellent graininess, sensitivity/fog ratio and
sharpness.Silver halide grains having two or more parallel
twinning planes have a tabular form (hereinafter
referred to as tabular grains). The tabular grains have
the following photographic characteristics.
(1) The ratio of the surface area of the grain to the
volume thereof (hereinafter referred to as specific
surface area) is high, and hence large amounts of
sensitizing dyes can be adsorbed by the surface of the
grain. Accordingly, color-sensitized sensitivity is
relatively high. (2) When emulsions comprising the tabular grains are
coated on a support and dried, the grains are arranged
parallel to the surface of the support. Accordingly,
light scattering caused by the grains can be reduced,
and sharpness and resolving power can be improved.
Further, the thickness of the coated layer can be
reduced by the above arrangement, and sharpness can be
improved.(3) The rate of development is rapid because the
specific surface area is large.(4) Covering power is high, and hence the amount of
silver used can be saved.The tabular grains have many advantages as
described above, and hence the tabular grains have been
conventionally used in marketing photographic materials
having high sensitivity.JP-A-58-113926 (the term "JP-A" as used herein
means an "unexamined published Japanese patent application"),
JP-A-58-113927 and JP-A-58-113928 disclose
emulsions comprising grains having an aspect ratio of 8
or higher. The term "aspect ratio" as used herein
refers to the ratio of the diameter of the tabular grain
to the thickness thereof. The diameter of the grain is
defined at the diameter of a circle having an area equal
to the projected area of the grain. The thickness of 
the grain refers to a distance between two parallel
principal surfaces constituting the tabular grain.Tabular grains conventionally prepared have poor
monodispersibility as shown in Examples of the above-described
patent specifications. This means that
1) the tabular grains have a wide grain size distribution
in terms of the diameter of the circle of the
corresponding projected area, and2) cylindric grains,
