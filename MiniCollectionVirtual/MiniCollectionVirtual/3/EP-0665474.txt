<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an elastic blade for
regulating the layer thickness of a toner, a method of
manufacturing the same and a developing device comprising the
elastic blade.Heretofore, in the developing device of an image
forming apparatus such as an electrophotographic
apparatus, the thickness of a toner layer on a developing
sleep carrying a toner thereon has been regulated by an
elastic blade and triboelectricity has been imparted to
the toner by friction.A blade made of rubber is used as such elastic
blade.However, this rubber blade, when used for a long
period, has caused a variation with time (plasticity
deformation) in its elastic material and has suffered
from a problem in durability.So, there has been proposed a developing device
utilizing, as a blade for regulating the quantity of
developer, a blade of two or more layers comprised of
an elastic layer for regulating the amount of charge of
a developer and a support layer for regulating pressure 
adhesively secured to the elastic layer.However, the support layer of this blade of two-layer
construction is thin and elongate and therefore
gives rise to warp.For this reason, this blade is affected by the
warp of the support layer and it is difficult to obtain
uniform contact pressure in the lengthwise direction of
a developing sleeve and therefore, it would occur to
mind to form a blade for regulating the quantity of
developer which is high in flatness. If the flatness of
the blade for regulating the quantity of developer is
thus made high, the toner could be uniformly regulated
and charged in the whole widthwise direction on the
sleeve and the pressure regulation by space saving,
low cost and highly accurate setting will not be
required.For this purpose, however, the flatness of the
support layer must not be made high and the manufacturing
process becomes complicated and difficult. Conventional elastic blades are known from JP-A-61-029 866 or
JP-A-61-028 973. Each of these elastic blades consists of a base
layer to which an elastic layer is adhered.It is an object of the present invention to provide an elastic
blade and a method of manufacturing an elastic blade such that
the elastic blade is high in flatness.According to the invention, this object is, with respect to the
blade, achieved by the features of claim 1 and with respect to
the method by the features of claim 7.Advantageous further developments are set out in the dependent
claims.A developing device comprising such an elastic blade is subject
matter of claim 6.Fig. 1 is a
