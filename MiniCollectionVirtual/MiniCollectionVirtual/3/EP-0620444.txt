<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a measurement circuit for measurement apparatuses intended
for measurements of energy in a three-phase network, wherein
output data are summed up in order to provide a result of
measurement of the electrical three-phase power (energy).As a rule, measurement apparatuses intended for measurements of energy in a three-phase
network comprise internally two or three identical power measurement
mechanisms, the output data of which are summed up. The connections of the measurement
mechanisms with the electrical network are fixed, and the arrangement depends on
which power (energy) quantity is supposed to be measured. The dimensioning of the voltage
circuits of the measurement mechanisms also depends on the arrangement of the measurement
mechanisms. Thus, by means of one measurement apparatus, it is possible to
measure power of one type only, such as, for example, effective power or reactive
power. Document GB-A- 094 989 discloses an electronic watthour meter
which includes a power flow direction detector circuit and a
pulse width modulation circuit for converting a voltage signal
proportional to the load voltage. In accordance with the output
of the power flow direction circuit the polarity of the output
signal of the pulse width modulation circuit is either inverted
or not inverted. The electronic watthour meter further comprises
a multiplication circuit which is controlled by the output of an
inversion circuit and which produces an output representing the
product of the voltage signal proportional to the load voltage
and a voltage signal proportional to the load current. The output
of the multiplication circuit is representative of the power
consumed according to the direction of power flow.In regard of the above prior art the object of the present invention
is to provide an improvement over this prior art measurement
arrangements for measurement apparatuses intended for measurements
of power (energy) in a three-phase network. A more specific
object of the invention is to provide a measurement circuit
that permits measurement of power (energy) of different types by
means of one and the same measurement apparatus.According to the present invention, these objects are achieved
by a measurement circuit for measurement apparatuses as defined
in the appended claims. According to the invention, the power measurement circuit is accomplished inside
an electronic meter based on the pulse width-height multiplier by means of digital
signals, which permits changing of the "wiring" (arrangement of
