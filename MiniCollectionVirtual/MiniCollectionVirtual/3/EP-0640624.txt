<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
preparation of a polyolefin which can provide a polyolefin 
having an extremely high melting point and a high 
stereoregularity in a high yield and also to a catalyst 
suitable for the process. More particularly, the present 
invention relates to an olefin polymerization catalyst 
comprising a Ziegler catalyst-on-carrier containing as an 
external donor a trialkoxysilane compound having an aliphatic 
substituent in which the carbon atom in the α-position 
adjacent to a silicon atom is a tertiary carbon atom and the 
carbon atom in the β-position is a tertiary carbon atom and 
also to a process for preparation of polyolefins in the 
presence of such an olefin polymerization catalyst. It has been heretofore known that the use of an 
organic silicon compound as a promotor component for a 
carried type Ziegler catalyst provides an improvement in the 
stereoregularity of the polymer thus produced. Organic silicon compounds which have been heretofore 
proposed can be roughly divided into the following two 
groups: Examples of such dialkoxysilane compounds include 
diphenyldimethoxysilane compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-57-63310, 
57-63311, 58-138708, 59-138708, 61-296006, 63-175008, 
63-289004 (the term "JP-A" as used herein means an 
"unexamined published Japanese patent application")), 
diisobutyldimethoxysilane compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-62-18406, 
63-258907, 2-70708, 2-173010, 3-33103), diisopropyldimethoxysilane 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-63-258907, 2-229807, 
3-33102, 3-33103), dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-2-229807), di-t-butyldimethoxysilane 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-2-70708, 2-229806, 
3-33102), dicyclohexyldimethoxysilane compounds (as 
disclosed in JP-A-63-258907), t-butyl(t-butoxy)dimethoxysilane 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-3-119004), 
methyldimethoxysilane compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-2-170803, 
2-229807), cyclohexylethyldimethoxysilane compounds 
(as disclosed in JP-A-2-163104), and t-butylmethyldimethoxysilane 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-62-11705, 62-20507, 
63-92615, 2-229807). Examples of such a trialkoxysilane compound include 
phenyltriethoxysilane compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-57-63311, 
58-83006, 62-20507, 61-296006), ethyltriethoxysilane 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-57-63310), butyltriethoxysilane 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-2-170803), t-butyltrimethoxysilane  
 
compounds (as disclosed in JP-A-63-11705,
