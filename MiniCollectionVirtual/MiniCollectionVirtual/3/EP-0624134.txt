<ABSTRACT>
In a shoe brake for rail vehicles, a brake linkage actuated by a braking cylinder by means of brake blocks (14) consisting of brake shoes (13) and brake shoe inserts (12) radially acts on at least one wheelset (1) of the running gear of the rail vehicle. The object of the invention is to arrange and design a cheap shoe break in such a way that it may bring up higher braking performances while avoiding damages to the tyres of the wheelset (1) and minimising the rolling noise of the wheelset (1). For that purpose, at least one rotationally symmetrical braking body (7) is fixed on the shaft (2) of the wheelset, between the disks (3) of the wheel set (1). The actuated brake shoe (14) is applied to the outer surface (8) of said braking body (7).

<CLAIMS>
Block brake for a rail power unit having wheel 
sets which are formed by wheel discs (3) which are 

connected by means of a wheel set shaft, on which wheel 
set shaft (2) rotationally symmetrical brake bodies (7) 

are arranged, having a brake cylinder which interacts via 
a brake beam (11) with a brake linkage which is connected 

to brake blocks (14), which brake blocks rest radially on 
both sides on the outer surfaces of the brake bodies, 

characterized in that the brake beam (11) which is 
coupled to the brake cylinder is constructed as a brake 

triangle and is axially guided by means of lateral guides 
(20) arranged on the frame (6) or on the subframe of the 

rail vehicle. 
Block brake according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that in each case at least one brake block (14) is 

provided on each side of the wheel set shaft (2) and both 
brake blocks (14), acting radially on the wheel set shaft 

(2) rest on the outer face (8) of the brake body (7) when 
activated. 
Block brake according to Claims 1 and 2, characterized 
in that two or more brake bodies (7) are arranged 

on the wheel set shaft (2) and for each brake body (7) in 
each case one brake block (14) which acts on the said 

body (7) is arranged on each side of the wheel set shaft 
(2). 
Block brake according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the brake block shoes are attached to 

brake block hangers (10) and are mounted on a brake beam 
(11). 
Block brake according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that each brake block (14) is guided axially 

on the brake body (7).
