<ABSTRACT>
Dialkyl dicarbonates are particularly advantageously obtained from haloformic acid esters by reaction with alkalis in the presence of water-immiscible organic solvents and in the presence of a catalyst if benzylalkyldimethylammonium halides are employed as catalyst. The catalyst is then particularly easily separable from the reaction mixture and recyclable.

Process according to Claims 1 to 2, characterized in 
that the alkalis used are alkali metal hydroxides in 

the form of aqueous solutions. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the water-immiscible organic solvents used are 

aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons or 
water-immiscible ethers. 
Process according to Claims 1 to 4, characterized in 
that the benzylalkyldimethylammonium halides used 

are those of the formula (III) 

 
in which 


n
represents an integer from 1 to 20 and
