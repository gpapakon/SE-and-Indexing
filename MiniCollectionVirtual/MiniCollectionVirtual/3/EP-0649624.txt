<ABSTRACT>
An outer wall cleaning robot includes an arm (14) 
pivotable about a first rotation axis (I) and a 

rotational body (15) supported by the arm for pivotal 
movement about a second rotation axis (II). The 

rotational body can be driven independently of a pivotal 
movement of the arm. To the rotational body are 

attached respective mounting mechanisms (17, 19) for a 
wiping squeegee (18) and a receiving squeegee (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to robots for cleaning
the outer wall surface of buildings or other constructions
which has windows, and particularly to robots for
cleaning windows of buildings.Along with modern buildings getting higher and
higher, the number of windows provided on the outer surface
of these high-rise buildings has been increasing
remarkably. In order to keep the windowpanes clean, it
is necessary to clean them on a periodical basis.In the past, windowpanes of high-rise buildings were
cleaned mostly by manual operations, where, for example,
a cleaning operator, riding on a gondola hung down from
the building rooftop, sprinkled clear water onto the windowpanes
and then wiped up the water with a squeegee or
the like. But, such traditional manual operations
provided very poor cleaning efficiency and also was very
dangerous.As an approach to solve the problems, window cleaning
robots have been developed and widely employed today
which are capable of cleaning windowpanes in a highly-mechanized
or automatic manner. In general, such prior
window cleaning robots include working components commonly
called gate-type squeegees, which are caused to 
perform its upward/downward, forward/rearward and tilting
movements based on the principle of Cartesian
(orthogonal) coordinates.As shown in Fig. 12, the prior window cleaning
robots of this type comprise a head case c having opposite
side portions vertically slidably fitted about
two linear guide shafts b, which are secured to a frame a
hung down from the rooftop of a building via wire ropes
r. To the head case c is connected a pair of motor-driven
cylinders d for extending and retracting a wiping
squeegee e. The wiping squeegee e and receiving squeegee
f are connected to the pistons of the motor-driven
cylinders d in such a manner that the two squeegees e and
f are movable toward and away from the outer wall surface
of the building (forward/rearward movement). Each of the
opposite side portions is further connected to an endless
chain that is wound at its both ends around upper and
lower sprocket wheels g and h, and the lower sprocket
wheel h is connected to a drive shaft j. The drive shaft
j is driven or rotated by a motor k, and rotation of the
drive shaft j causes the head case c to move in an upward
and downward direction along the linear guide shafts b.
Further, to the head case c is fixed another pair of
motor-driven cylinders l for pivotally moving the
squeegee e in a vertical direction. Driving this motor-driven
cylinder 1 can change the tilt

An outer wall cleaning robot comprising:

an arm (14) pivotable about a first rotation axis (I) that
extends in a substantially horizontal direction in approximately

parallel relation to an outer wall surface of
a building (6);
an arm driving mechanism connected to said arm (14) for
driving said arm to pivot about said first rotation axis (I);
a rotational body (15) supported by said arm (14) in such a
manner that said rotational body is pivotable about a

second rotation axis (II) extending in parallel with said
first rotation axis (I);
a rotational-body driving mechanism far driving said
rotational body (15) independently of driving of said arm by

said arm driving mechanism;
a wiping-squeegee mounting mechanism (17) attached to
said rotational body; and
a wiping squeegee (18) attached to said mounting
mechanism.
An outer wall cleaning robot as defined in claim 1
which further comprises a receiving-squeegee mounting

mechanism (19) pivotably supported relative to said rotational
body (15), a receiving squeegee (20) attached to said 

receiving-squeegee mounting mechanism (19) so as to be positioned
below said wiping squeegee (18), for receiving soiled

water resultant from cleaning of the outer wall, a clutch
mechanism (60) for connecting or disconnecting said receiving

squeegee (20) to or from said rotational body (15), and a stopper
mechanism (80) for preventing said receiving squeegee from

pivoting downward from a predetermined position.
An outer wall cleaning robot as defined in claim 1
or 2 wherein said arm mounting mechanism and said

rotational-body driving mechanism are provided separately
from said arm (14).
An outer wall cleaning robot as defined in claim 2
wherein said receiving-squeegee mounting mechanism (19) includes

a slider base (65c), a slider (65d) mounted to said slider
base for sliding movement along said slider body in a

forward and rearward direction, and drive means (203, 203a) for driving
said slider (65d), and wherein said receiving squeegee (20) is

fixed to said slider. 
An outer wall cleaning robot as defined in claim 1
wherein said wiping-squeegee mounting mechanism (17) comprises

a squeegee mounting section (100) to which said wiping
squeegee (18) is fixedly secured, and a squeegee mounting section

supporting section (102) having a vertical pin (108) located
aprroximately in the central portion of said squeegee

mounting section and on which said squeegee mounting
section (100) is horizontally pivotably mounted.
An outer wall cleaning robot as defined in claim 5
wherein said wiping-sqeegee mounting mechanism (17) further

comprises:

drive means (112) coupled to said squeegee mounting section
supporting section for driving said squeegee mounting

section supporting section toward and away from the
outer wall surface of the building;
guide means (126) for guiding the movement of said
squeegee mounting section supporting section toward and

away from the outer wall surface of the building;
a pressure sensor (132) for detecting pressure of the
wiping-squeegee (18) against a windowpane (152) in association with

said squeegee mounting section supporting section; and
drive control means (134) for controlling said drive means
in such a manner that said squeegee mounting section supporting

section is caused to move toward the windowpane
when pressure detected by said pressure sensor is below a

preset value and said squeegee mounting section supporting 
section is caused to moved away from the windowpane (152)

when pressure detected by said pressure sensor (132) is above
the preset value.
