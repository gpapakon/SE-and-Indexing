<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to peptides immunoreactive 
with anti-apolipoprotein(a) antibodies and to the use of 

these peptides in raising monoclonal and polyclonal 
antibodies. The peptides may also be used in 

immunoassays, such as competitive inhibition ELISA 
immunoassays. Their corresponding oligonucleotides are 

useful as probes and primers in nucleic acid based 
methodologies such as NASBA, PCR or any other sequence 

based amplification technology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to peptides immunoreactive 
with anti-apolipoprotein(a) antibodies and to their use in 
raising monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies and their use in 
immunoassays, and to their corresponding oligonucleotides which 
are useful as probes and primers in nucleic acid methodologies. The lipoproteins, which include chylomicrons, very-low-density 
lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density-lipoproteins (LDL), and 
high-density-lipoproteins (HDL), are the primary carriers of 
plasma cholesterol. These particles are composed of various 
proportions of triglycerides, cholesterol, cholesterol ester, 
phospholipids and proteins. The latter are known as 
apolipoproteins and play a key role in the metabolism of 
lipoproteins. Some activate enzymes that are important in the 
covalent modification of lipids and in the remodeling of 
lipoprotein subfractions while others serve as receptor ligands 
that target remodeled lipoproteins to specific tissue sites where 
their respective lipid components are stored or used.  Lipoprotein(a) is a class of lipoprotein particles similar 
to LDL, but distinct due to the covalent linkage of apo B100 to 
apolipoprotein(a) ("apo(a)"), a glycoprotein with significant 
homology to plasminogen. High plasma concentrations of Lp(a) are 
associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic disorders 
including intermittent claudication, aortic aneurysms, coronary 
artery stenosis, myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction. 
Studies implicating the role of Lp(a) in atherogenesis have 
focused on the binding of Lp(a) to endothelial cells and 
macrophages and to extracellular plasma proteins such as fibrin. 
In vitro studies with human fibroblasts and monocytes have 
demonstrated that Lp(a) is taken up by the LDL receptor. In 
addition, lipid peroxidation of Lp(a) results in uptake by the 
scavenger receptor on macrophages. The scavenger receptor is 
structurally different than the LDL receptor and is thought to 
play a role in lipid peroxide modified LDL uptake in atheromas. 
It has been demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that apo(a) and 
apo B are present in arterial wall plaques. Lp(a)-like particles 
can be isolated from plaques. Furthermore, a correlation between 
serum Lp(a) levels and amounts of apo(a) in arterial walls has 
been reported. Some studies have implicated a role for Lp(a) in 
atherothrombosis due to the homology between apo(a) and 
plasminogen. Lp(a) competes with plasminogen for binding to 
fibrin. Because Lp(a) does not enzymatically cleave
