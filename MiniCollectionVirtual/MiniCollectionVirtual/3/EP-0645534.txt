<ABSTRACT>
A fuel-injection pump for a turbocharged diesel 
engine not equipped with a boost compensator is able to 

suppress the generation of black smoke when the engine is 
subjected to sudden acceleration from a low-speed state, or 

to low speed, high load operation, by reducing the fuel 
injection quantity. 

The pump comprises a plunger barrel (24) in which are formed intake and 
exhaust ports (32,33) that communicate with a fuel reserve chamber (30), 

said intake and exhaust ports (32,33) being constituted by a large 
diameter main port (32) and a small diameter sub-port (33) arranged so 

that the upper edge of the sub-port (33) is not above the upper edge of 
main port (32), a plunger (25) disposed within the plunger barrel (24), 

an inclined lead (35) being formed on the plunger (25) at a position 
that permits communication with the intake and exhaust ports (32,33), an 

upper sub-lead (36) being formed on the head portion of the plunger (25) 
that is able to communicate with the sub-port (33) over a prescribed 

range of rotation by the plunger (25), and which permits the sup-port 
(33) to communicate with the upper sub-lead (36) even when the main port 

(32) is closed by the upper edge of the plunger (25).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a fuel injection
pump for a diesel engine as known from US-A-2 361 817. It is preferably fitted with a turbo-charger, and
more particularly it refers to a fuel-injection pump for a
turbocharged diesel engine that has an injection
compensation mechanism.In a turbocharged diesel engine, exhaust gas from
the combustion chamber (engine cylinder) is used to
compress intake air which is then supplied to the engine to
increase the power of the engine.In a conventional turbocharged diesel engine,
changes in the boost pressure provided by the turbocharger
is a function of the fuel injection pump speed in rpm (N)
and injection quantity or load (Q).A conventional turbocharged diesel engine will
now be described briefly, with reference to Figure 7. In
Figure 7, a turbocharged diesel engine 1 has a engine body
2, a piston 3, a turbocharger 4, a governor 5 and a fuel
injection pump 6. A crankshaft 8 is turned by the
reciprocating movement of the piston 3 in a combustion
chamber 7. The turbocharger 4 uses the exhaust gas from an
exhaust manifold 9 to compress intake air, and the air thus
compressed is delivered to the combustion chamber 7 via an
intake manifold 10.The governor 5 controls the fuel injection
quantity in accordance with the speed (rpm) of the 
turbocharged diesel engine 1. The fuel injection pump 6
has a camshaft 11 driven by the crankshaft 8, an injection
pipe 12, and an injection nozzle 13 arranged in opposition
to the combustion chamber 7. One method that is commonly
used to evaluate the performance of an engine such as the
turbocharged diesel engine 1 consists of measuring the
level of black smoke that is generated when the engine is
subjected to sudden acceleration from a low idle. However,
a problem with the diesel engine 1 is that sharply
accelerating the engine from a low idle causes an excessive
quantity of fuel to be injected and black smoke to be
produced. This is explained below.The graph of Figure 8 shows the relationship
between pump speed N (or engine speed) and injection
quantity Q. In the graph, the relationship in the case of
an engine that does not have a turbocharger 4 is indicated
by a broken line, while the higher injection quantity Q of
the engine 1 equipped with the turbocharger 4 is indicated
by a solid line. Injecting more than the proper quantity
of fuel during low-speed operation causes black smoke to be
produced. In a conventional arrangement, a device known as
a boost compensator (not shown) was used to control the
relationship between

a cam (22) driven by rotation of the crankshaft (11),
a plunger barrel (24) that is affixed to the pump
housing and in which are formed intake and exhaust ports

that communicate with a fuel reserve chamber, said
intake and exhaust ports being constituted by a large

diameter main port (32) and a small diameter sub-port
(33) arranged so that the upper edge (33A) of the sub-port

is below or at the same height as the upper edge
(32A) of the main port,

position that permits communication with the intake and

exhaust ports,
an upper sub-lead (36) formed as a recess on the head
portion of the plunger (25) that is able to communicate

with the sub-port (33) over a prescribed range of
rotation by the plunger, and which permits the sub-port

(33) to communicate with the upper sub-lead (36) even
when the main port (32) is closed by an upper edge of

the plunger, and
