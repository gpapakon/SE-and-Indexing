<ABSTRACT>
New, highly solid organomineral products are obtained by reacting polyisocyanates with aqueous alkali silicate solutions and cement. These products are characterized by shorter curing time during preparation, greater solidity and non-inflammability, in comparison with usual polyurethane systems and polyisocyanate-alkali silicate masses. Also disclosed is a process for preparing these products and a process for consolidating and sealing coal and/or rocky, soil or brick formations, according to which the organomineral products are prepared from said initial substances within the formation to be consolidated or sealed.
