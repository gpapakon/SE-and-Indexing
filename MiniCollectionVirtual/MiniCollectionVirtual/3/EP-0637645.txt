<ABSTRACT>
It is proposed, for the production of a rigid railroad-base for railborne traffic, to lay track sleepers (3) on a substantially plane, continuous supporting layer (1) and to retain them, in a manner incapable of horizontal displacement, by a dowel-like device (7) between sleeper and supporting layer. The device (7) passes through the joint (18) between the sleeper (3) and the supporting layer (1) and at the top fixes into the sleeper and at the bottom into the supporting layer, at least one of the two associated fixing-in arrangements permitting a vertical movement between the device (7) and the structural member into which it fixes (1 and 3 respectively), and both fixing-in arrangements, in cooperation, retaining the sleeper (3) resiliently on the supporting layer (1) at least in respect of loads acting on the longitudinal axis of the sleeper.
