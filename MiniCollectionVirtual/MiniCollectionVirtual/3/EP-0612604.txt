<ABSTRACT>
Device for manufacturing a profile (S) which comprises a plasticising device (1) with an extrusion die (2) for the continuous production of a profile (S), a take-off device (6), continuously taking off the said profile, and a calibrating means (4), arranged between this plasticising device (1) and the take-off device (6). At least in the region of the surfaces of the profile (S) which are later visible, there is fitted in each case between the plasticising device (1) and the calibrating means (4) at least one metallic strip (10), which is at least as wide as the profile (S) running transversely to the direction of movement (P) of the latter and protrudes by its end face into the plane in which the corresponding surface of the profile (S) lies. The width of this strip (10) in the direction of movement (P) of the profile (S) is at most 25 mm, preferably at most 10 mm. This strip (10) is separated from the calibrating means (4) by an air gap (12) which is subjected to a vacuum. The patent application also relates to the process which is realised by means of this device.

A device for the manufacture of a section body (S),
consisting of a plasticising device (1) for the continuous

production of this section body (S), of a drawing off device
(6) continuously drawing off this section body (S) and of a

calibration (4), arranged between the plasticising device
(1) and the drawing off device (6), through which

calibration (4) the section body is drawn, wherein between
the plasticising device (1) and the actual calibration (4)

at least in the region of the faces of the section body (S)
which are later visible, in each case a metallic strip (10)

is arranged which, running transversely to the direction of
movement (P) of the section body (S) is at least as wide as

the latter and which projects with the end face (11) into
the plane in which the corresponding face of the section

body (S) lies, characterized in that the width of this strip
in the direction of movement (P) of the section body (S)

amounts to a maximum of 25 mm, preferably a maximum of 10
mm, and that the strip (10) is separated from the

calibration (4) by an air gap (12) which is acted upon by a
vacuum.
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the strip (10) is secured on the calibration (4) or is

constructed in one piece therewith.
A device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the strip (10) is secured on the injection head (2) of the

plasticising device (1).
A device according to one of Claims 1-3, characterised
in that the front face (11) of the strip (10) is rounded in

the direction of movement (P) of the section body (S).
A device according to one of Claims 1-4, characterised
in that the front face (11) of the strip (10) is 

approximately in alignment with the corresponding face of
the cavity of the calibration (4) receiving the section body

(S).
A method for the manufacture of a section body (S),
consisting of a plasticised, continuously produced plastics

section, formed in a nozzle, which section is continuously
drawn off through an outlet (6) and which is drawn between

the forming nozzle (2) and the drawing off device (6)
through a calibrating device (4) which gives a surface

contour and which has a metal strip (10) in the inlet
region, characterized in that in the inlet region of the

calibrating device (4) through a gap (12), formed between
the strip (10) and the calibrating device (4), transversely

to the extrusion direction (P) a uniform vacuum is applied
to at least the faces of the section body (S) which are

later visible, that this vacuum is also maintained in the
case of the supply of infiltrated air, because the volume of

the gap (12) is small in relation to the vacuum space lying
thereabove, and that volatile components are drawn off from

the surface of the section (S) through the vacuum applied in
a hot state, and these components are transported away via

the vacuum.
A method according to Claim 6, characterised in that
the gap (12) is between 10-20 mm distant from the inlet

region.
