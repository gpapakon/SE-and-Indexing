<ABSTRACT>
Fluoro-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids, and particular 2- and 4-fluorobenzoic acid can be made from the corresponding fluoro-methyl compound such as fluorotoluene in a single stage by reaction at elevated temperature, preferably of at least 80  C with hydrogen peroxide and bromide in mole ratios to the substrate of greater than 2:1, and preferably around 3:1, in the presence of means capable of generating bromine free radicals from bromine molecules, such as radiation having a wavelength of not greater than 600 nm or an organic peroxide.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Process for the oxidation of aromatic methyl groupsThe present invention relates to a process for the production of aromatic carboxylic acids and more particularly fluoro-substituted aromatic carboxylic acids. Fluoro substituted aromatic carboxylic acids are intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and/or agrochemicals. A number of processes for their production employ an alkyl substituted fluoroaromatic compound as starting material but these can require specialist equipment such as electrochemical cells, or elevated pressure or specialist techniques as in enzymatic oxidation.In European Patent Application numbers EP-A-0 336 567 and EP-A-0 336 568 there are disclosed processes for selectively monobrominating or dibrominating an al yl side chain of an aromatic compound substituted by an electron withdrawing group, viz o-nitrotoluene with aqueous hydrogen peroxide and a source of bromine under photolytic conditions. In accordance with accepted understanding of aromatic substitution reactions, the electron-withdrawing substituent on the benzene nucleus tended to deactivate the substrate, thereby inhibiting its ability to participate in substitution reactions. Although the reaction mixture included a significant aqueous phase, further reaction of the bro inated products for example by hydrolysis was substantially avoided. Thus, the brominated products were available for further processing, for example to the eventual production of o-nitrobenzoic acid, but an overall conversion from alkyl to carboxylic acid required the 

addition of further and potentially cumbersome processing stages which inevitably introduces additional processing costs and reduces throughput in apparatus of a given size. Surprisingly, it has been found that in a related class of alkylaromatic compounds nuclearly substituted by an electron withdrawing group, the alkyl group can be converted in a single stage to a carboxylic acid group, rather than requiring a series of stages.According to the present invention there is provided a process for the conversion of a methyl substituent of a fluoro-nuclearly substituted aromatic compound to a carboxylic acid substituent which comprises bringing into contact at an elevated reaction temperature the fluoro- substituted aromatic compound with hydrogen peroxide and aqueous hydrogen bromide solution each in a mole ratio to the fluoro-substituted aromatic compound of greater than 2:1 in the presence of means for generating bromine radicals from bromine molecules.By the use of a process
