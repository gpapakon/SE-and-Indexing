<ABSTRACT>
Metal complexes having high bulk density and a process for 
the production of the same without the generation of heavy metal-contaminated 

effluents are disclosed. Solid complexes of 
EDTANaFe and EDTAKFe having high bulk densities are formed by 

reaction with mixed metal solutions containing low chromium 
levels, followed by total drying of the resulting mixture in the 

same processing equipment without the prior separation of the 
sulfate salts formed. The amounts of the various metals in any 

given formulation can be preselected.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. 
Serial No. 07/958,376 filed October 8, 1992. Conventional processes for the production of solid Fe(III) 
chelates for agricultural and other uses generate waste crystal 
liquors with high concentrations of iron and heavy metals, 
particularly chromium. Such heavy metals are problematic from 
an environmental standpoint. The economic implications of 
properly disposing of such streams are significant, and are often 
prohibitive. In addition, the waste liquor can contain some 
soluble product. Although disposal of the waste liquors without 
recovering the product results in yield loss, recovery of 
contained product is not economical. A conventional process for producing the complexes involves 
reacting chelating agents, such as EDTANa₄ or DTPANa₅, with 
ferric chloride solution, followed by filtration, washing and 
drying. However, one major source of chromium contamination is 
the ferric chloride used as the ferric iron source. Where low 
cost grade ferric chloride derived from scrap iron is used, the 
chromium concentration of the waste streams produced is on the 
order of 30 ppm. Higher grade ferric chloride can be used, which 
can reduce the chromium concentration in the waste streams to 
about 2-3 ppm; however, this higher grade ferric chloride is more 
expensive. A further drawback of ferric chloride is the highly 
corrosive properties of the slurries and liquors produced from 
the chelating agent/ferric chloride reactions. Prior art drying processes include spray drying and drum  
 
drying. However, the resulting product is often very dusty, 
which creates handling problems. Accordingly, there is a need 
to find an alternative production process which reduces or 
eliminates the generation of high heavy metal effluents without 
adding significant cost. Fertilizer formulations often contain secondary nutrients 
or micronutrients. These are metals, usually in the form of 
metal complexes. EDTA is the most commonly used chelating agent 
and the major micronutrient metals are iron, copper, manganese 
and zinc. Several other metals are also used as micronutrients 
in such formulations, including boron, molybdenum and cobalt. 
Secondary nutrients are calcium and magnesium. The major 
components of fertilizer formulations are potash, phosphate and 
nitrogen compounds. To prepare these formulations, the components 
are blended. This operation requires adding to the blender the 
major components plus very small amounts of two or more micronutrients
