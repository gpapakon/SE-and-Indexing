<ABSTRACT>
A novel atomic frequency standard includes an 
absorption cell containing a first volume of atoms for 

varying an intensity of light energy passing 
therethrough; at least one dielectric resonator for 

generating an evanescent electromagnetic field that 
effects hyperfine energy level transitions of the 

first volume of atoms; a waveguide for housing the 
absorption cell and one or more dielectric 

resonator(s); a photo detector mounted near an end of 
the waveguide for receiving light energy; and an 

electromagnetic energy injector for 
electromagnetically exciting the dielectric 

resonator(s). Preferably, a filter cell is positioned 
adjacent to a dielectric resonator between the 

absorption cell and the light source. Tuning of the 
resonant frequency of the dielectric resonator(s) can 

be accomplished by adjusting the distance between the 
filter cell and the adjacent dielectric resonator, and 

can also he accomplished by positioning a dielectric 
tuning disk adjacent a dielectric resonator, and 

adjusting the distance between the dielectric 
resonator and the dielectric tuning disk.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to frequency 
standards and more particularly to optically-pumped 
atomic frequency standards. An atomic frequency standard is a device having a 
resonant system derived from an atomic or molecular 
specie experiencing a transition between two or more 
well-defined energy levels of the atom or molecule. For example, the two lowest energy levels of the 
rubidium atom (Rb) are known as the ground state 
hyperfine energy levels A and B. When atoms of 
gaseous Rb-87 at levels A and B are irradiated with 
microwave energy at a precise "transition frequency", 
corresponding to the rubidium frequency that causes 
atom transitions between the hyperfine energy levels, 
the rubidium atoms at hyperfine energy level A will 
make the transition to level B, and vice versa. The 
transition is employed as a highly accurate frequency 
reference to which the frequency of a quartz crystal 
oscillator or voltage-controlled crystal oscillator 
(VCXO) can be electronically locked in creating an 
atomic frequency standard. In such atomic-controlled oscillators the 
frequency of a quartz crystal oscillator is controlled 
by means of a physics package and associated 
electronics that are devoted to maintaining the 
assigned output frequency, typically 5 MHz or 10 MHz, 
on a very long-term, exceedingly accurate and stable 
basis. By properly slaving the quartz crystal 
oscillator to the frequency of the atomic transition 
in the physics package, the tendency of the quartz  
 
crystal to exhibit drifting due to aging and other 
inherent as well as environmental effects is markedly 
suppressed. The physics package of a typical atomic 
frequency standard generally includes a microwave 
cavity resonator, an isotopic filter cell, an 
absorption cell, a light source, a photo detector, 
temperature control means, and at least one magnetic 
shield surrounding these components. In such a typical rubidium atomic frequency 
standard, for example, the light source is a glass 
bulb containing rubidium atoms which produces light by 
an rf-excited plasma discharge. The rubidium in the 
lamp is heated to a vapor state, approximately 110°C, 
and is subjected to a high-energy rf field, thereby 
generating light from the excited rubidium atoms. The 
"rubidium light" is directed through a filter cell 
which contains an isotope of rubidium, such as Rb-85, 
which filters out light with a wavelength that will 
stimulate transition of atoms from the hyperfine 
energy level B to any optically-excited level C. The 
filtered
