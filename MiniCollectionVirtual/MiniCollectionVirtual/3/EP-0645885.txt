<ABSTRACT>
A phase shifter (100) comprises first and second single 
pole double throw switches (2, 26), a low-pass filter 

(100a), and a high-pass filter (100b). The first switch (2) 
has an input terminal (1) and first and second output 

terminals (3, 4), and the second switch (26) has first and 
second input terminals (27, 28) and an output terminal (25). 

The low-pass filter (100a) is interposed between the first 
output terminal (3) of the first switch (2) and the first 

input terminal (27) of the second switch (26) and includes a 
plurality of FETs (32, 35, 37) as capacitors. The high-pass 

filter (100b) is interposed between the second output 
terminal (4) of the first switch (2) and the second input 

terminal (28) of the second switch (26) and includes a 
plurality of FETs (40, 41, 43) as capacitors. The input 

terminal (1) of the first switch (2) and the output terminal 
(25) of the second switch (26) are an input terminal and an 

output terminal of the phase shifter (100), respectively. 
Each of the high-pass filter (100b) and the low-pass filter 

(100a) produces two different phase quantities by the on-off 
switching of the FETs. Therefore, four different phase 

quantities, i.e., two different phase shift quantities, are 
realized in the phase shifter.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a phase shifter 
including a high-pass filter and a low-pass filter. Figure 8 is a circuit diagram illustrating a prior art 
high-pass/low-pass phase shifter. In the figure, a phase 
shifter 600 comprises two SPDT (Single Pole Double Throw) 
switches 2 and 26, a low-pass filter 8, and a high-pass 
filter 9. The low-pass filter 8 is interposed between a 
first output terminal 3 of the SPDT switch 2 and a first 
input terminal 27 of the SPDT switch 26. The low-pass 
filter 8 comprises two inductors 13 and 15 connected in 
series and a capacitor 14 interposed between the junction of 
the inductors 13 and 15 and ground. The high-pass filter 9 
is interposed between a second output terminal 4 of the SPDT 
switch 2 and a second input terminal 28 of the SPDT switch 
26. The high-pass filter 9 comprises grounded inductors 16 
and 18 and a capacitor 17 interposed between the inductors 
16 and 18. In this circuit, an input terminal 1 of the SPDT 
switch 2 and an output terminal 25 of the SPDT switch 26 
serve as input and output terminals of the whole circuit. The SPDT switch 2 includes FETs (Field Effect 
Transistors) 2a to 2d and resistors 2e to 2h of several kΩ. 
A gate bias terminal 6 is connected to gates of the FETs 2a  
 
and 2d, and a gate bias terminal 7 is connected to gates of 
the FETs 2b and 2c. The SPDT switch 26 includes FETs 26a to 
26d and resistors 26e to 26h of several kΩ. A gate bias 
terminal 30 is connected to gates of the FETs 26a and 26d, 
and a gate bias terminal 31 is connected to gates of the 
FETs 26b and 26c. A description is given of the operation. Initially, the FETs 2a and 2d are turned on by a gate 
bias voltage applied to the gate bias terminal 6, the FETs 
2b and 2c are turned off by a gate bias voltage applied to 
the gate bias terminal 7, the FETs 26a and 26d are turned on 
by a gate bias voltage applied to the gate bias terminal 30, 
and the FETs 26b and 26c are turned off by a gate bias 
voltage applied to the gate bias terminal 31, whereby the 
first output terminal 3 of the SPDT switch 2 and the first 
input terminal 27 of the SPDT switch 26 are selected. In 
this state, a signal applied to the input terminal 1 travels 
through the first output terminal 3 of the SPDT switch 2, 
the low-pass filter 8, and the first input terminal 27 of 
the SPDT switch 26, and it is output from the output 
terminal 25. At this time, the transmission phase of the 
signal from the input terminal 1 to the output terminal 25 
is delayed, and a variation (ϑ) in
