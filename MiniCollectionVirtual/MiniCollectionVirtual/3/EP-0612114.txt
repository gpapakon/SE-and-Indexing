<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for forming a patterned 
oxide superconductor thin film, more specifically to a method for 
forming a patterned oxide superconductor thin film without degrading the 
oxide superconductor thin film itself. Devices which utilize superconducting phenomena operate rapidly 
with low power consumption so that they have higher performance than 
conventional semiconductor devices. Particularly, by using an oxide 
superconducting material which has been recently advanced in study, it is 
possible to produce a superconducting device which operates at relatively 
high temperature. Researches on Josephson junction devices, 
superconducting transistors, superconducting field effect devices, etc. 
utilizing those oxide superconductors are now in progress. A Josephson junction device which is one of well known 
superconducting devices can be realized in various structures. Among the 
various structures, the most preferable structure in practice is a stacked 
junction realized by a thin non-superconductor layer sandwiched between 
a pair of superconductors. However, a point contact type junction, a  
 
micro bridge type junction and a variable thickness bridge type junction 
which are composed of a pair of superconductor regions which are 
weakly linked to each other also exhibit Josephson effect. Since these Josephson junctions have fine structures which are in 
order of a few times of the coherent length, it is difficult to obtain 
Josephson junction devices having homogeneous and stable properties. In 
particular, oxide superconductors are easily degraded during processings 
so that it is difficult to manufacture Josephson junction devices of the 
above types utilizing oxide superconductors having excellent properties. In order to resolve the above problems, there is proposed a 
different type junction which can be manufactured by using oxide 
superconductors without fine processings. This type of a Josephson 
junction is so called a grain boundary type Josephson junction which 
consists of two superconducting electrodes formed of single crystal films 
of an oxide superconductor having different crystalline orientations and a 
grain boundary between them. In this type of the Josephson junction, the 
two superconducting electrodes are considered to be weakly linked 
through the grain boundary so that the grain boundary forms a weak link 
of a Josephson junction. This type of the Josephson junction is manufactured by depositing 
an oxide superconductor thin film on a single
