<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air conditioning apparatus
having a power-variable type compressor whose power is variable
using an inverter, and particularly to an air conditioning
apparatus using an improved adjustment technique for adjusting
the output of a source voltage detection circuit.Recently, an inverter air conditioning apparatus
(hereinafter referred to as "inverter air conditioner") has
broadly propagated as an air conditioning apparatus which is
capable of adjusting the temperature in a room or the like in
fine level. The inverter air conditioner is designed so that the
rotating frequency of a motor of a compressor is varied in
accordance with an air conditioning load which is detected on the
basis of the temperature detected by a temperature sensor,
thereby varying a compression power of the compressor. Through
this air conditioning operation, a space such as a room or the
like is kept in the optimum air conditional state.In general, a package type inverter air conditioner adopts
an open loop control operation using a V/f control in which the
motor is controlled on the basis of the ratio (V/f) of an output
voltage of the inverter (an input voltage of the motor) and a 
driving frequency f of the motor.In the V/f control type inverter air conditioner as
described above, when the input voltage of the inverter is varied
(fluctuated), the output voltage of the inverter is also varied
substantially at the same level as variation of the input voltage
at the same driving frequency. In consideration of the variation
of the input voltage to the inverter, a permissible voltage range
ΔV with a center voltage C at the center of the voltage range is
set for the output voltage to avoid troubles due to the variation
of the input voltage to some extent.However, when the input voltage is beyond a variation upper-limit
value UL or a variation lower-limit value LL, the following
trouble occurs.That is, when the input voltage increases greatly at a low
driving frequency f1 represented by a in Fig. 7, the output
voltage exceeds the upper limit value UL and thus an excessive
voltage is applied to the motor, so that the motor falls into an
overexcitation state. If the overexcitation is remarkable, the
temperature of an excitation winding of the motor is increased,
and the excitation winding may be burned out.On the other hand, when the input voltage decreases greatly
at a high driving frequency region f2 to f3 which is represented
by b in Fig. 7, the output voltage of the inverter is beyond the
lower limit value LL
