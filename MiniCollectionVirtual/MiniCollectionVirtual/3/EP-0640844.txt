<ABSTRACT>
Electrically scanning dual-beam antenna intended to be installed on a moving platform and in particular on a satellite. The antenna according to the invention comprises a single complex reflector (104), the reflectivity of which is sensitive to the polarisation of the illumination, and two arrays of sources of orthogonal polarisations which illuminate the complex reflector in an "offset" geometry. The complex reflector consists of two reflectors placed one in front of the other, along the direction of propagation of the beams; the first reflector (114) being transparent for a first linear polarisation and reflecting for the orthogonal polarisation, and the second reflector (124) being reflecting for at least the second polarisation. The two resultant beams are thus separated in space, along a direction parallel to the trajectory of the platform. The electronic scanning is performed in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the orbit. Application to stereoscopic radars for earth observation from a satellite, and to radiometry.
