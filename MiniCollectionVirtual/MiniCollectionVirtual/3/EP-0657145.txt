<ABSTRACT>
A low profile dental torque ratchet system is provided 
having a disposable breakaway color coded insert (40) for 

holding a tool to be driven by a torsional ratchet wrench (10). 
Incorporated within the ratchet wrench is a driver (14) that 

drives the tool until a preset torsional force shears the 
insert.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to restorative 
dentistry and more particularly to a torque control 
system for use when driving and tightening components used 
in a dental prosthodontic restoration especially those 
involving dental implants. Prosthodontic restorative systems and techniques are 
well-known in the prior art. For partially or fully 
edentulous patients, a dental implant fixture is implanted 
in a cylindrical bore made in the alveolar ridge crest of 
a patient's jawbone after the gum tissue has been 
displaced. The fixture typically includes an internally-threaded 
cylindrical socket which receives one or more 
components used for attaching a permanent dental restoration 
to the fixture. The components typically include an 
abutment base in the form of a short tubular body having 
a transverse wall at a first end thereof shaped to mate 
with the gingival aspect of a transverse surface of the 
implant fixture. The abutment base has a bore there-through 
for receiving an abutment screw used to retain the 
abutment base to the fixture. A coping is retained in the  
 
abutment screw using a coping screw. A dental restoration, 
in the form of an anatomical overlay, is adapted to 
be fabricated to the coping. Such systems are shown in 
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,645,453 and 5,078,607 to Niznick. The various components of the dental prosthodontic 
restoration are typically driven and tightened with 
respect to the implant mixture or each other using a 
plurality of different drivers, one for each type of 
component. The prosthodontist manipulates the drivers 
manually or through the use of an automatic device. Precise and complete tightening of the components in 
a restoration is often difficult to achieve manually. 
Thus, the components often loosen and back-out of their 
fittings, requiring repeated office visits for the 
retightening. To combat the loosening or unscrewing of 
the implant/prosthetic system a pre-determined pre-load 
needs to be applied to the engaged threads. To accomplish 
this process several torsional ratchet tools have been 
designed. Of these tools, a few incorporate a breakaway 
feature to generate the desired torque and prevent the 
seating tool or screw from stripping. Although these 
breakaway ratchets meet the desired functional requirements, 
due to wear they do not maintain their calibration 
after continuous use. Furthermore, incorporating this 
breakaway feature into the available ratchets has made the 
final tool's cost, size, sterility and ease of use
