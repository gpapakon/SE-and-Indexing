A process for the continuous preparation of polytetramethyleneadipamide, 
in which an aqueous solution of 

a salt of 1,4-diaminobutane and adipic acid is heated 
under from 1 to 10 bar to 270-330°C with formation of a 

prepolymer and of a vapor phase and the vapor phase and 
the prepolymer are separated, wherein 


a) the aqueous solution of the salt of 1,4-diaminobutane 
and adipic acid is heated in an evaporator 

zone under a gage pressure of from 1 to 10 bar with 
simultaneous evaporation of water in the course of 

a residence time of not more than 120 sec with 
formation of a vapor phase and of a molten prepolymer 

to 270-330°C, 
b) the prepolymer and the vapor phase are passed, with 
thorough mixing, in the course of a residence time 

of from 70 to 120 sec, through an immediately adjacent 
mass transfer zone which is provided with 

baffles, under from 1 to 10 bar and at from 270 to 
330°C, and a molten polymer and a vapor phase are 

obtained, 
c) the vapor phase is separated from the polymer in a 
separation zone and the polymer is discharged as a 

melt capable of being granulated, with the proviso 
that the residence time of the melt in the stages 

a), b) and c) is less than 5 minutes in total and 
d) pyrrolidine is separated off by distillation from 
the vapor phase obtained in stage c) and 1,4-diaminobutane 

is recycled to the evaporator 
stage a). 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein a  
 

conversion of more than 93% is maintained in stage a). 
A process as claimed in claims 1 and 2, wherein 
from 300 to 310°C and from 7 to 9 bar are maintained in 

stage a). 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein a residence time of from 70 to 100 sec is maintained 

in stage a). 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein a residence time of from 70 to 100 sec is maintained 

in stage b). 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 5, 
wherein from 300 to 310°C and from 7 to 9 bar are maintained 

in stage b). 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, 
wherein a residence time of less than 60 sec is maintained 

in stage c). 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein a terminal amino group content of from 150 to 

400 meq per kg and a relative viscosity of from 1.50 to 
1.55 are maintained in the melt discharged from stage c). 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 8, 
wherein the polymer obtained from stage c) is subjected 

to solid-phase postcondensation with superheated steam at 
from 220 to 270°C, and highly polymeric tetrahydromethyleneadipamide 

is obtained. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, 

wherein additives are added to the polymer discharged 
from stage c).
