<ABSTRACT>
A security label (22) is constructed from label stock 
(23) having top and bottom faces. A release coat (24) is 

provided on the label stock bottom face, a non-opaque tie 
coat (25) provided on the release coat, and an opaque coat of 

permanent pressure sensitive adhesive (27) provided on the 
tie coat. The tie coat has a significantly greater affinity 

for the adhesive than for the release coat. Indicia (26), 
such as reverse printed alphanumeric characters, is provided 

on the tie coat substantially between the adhesive and the 
tie coat so that "void", or a similar security designation, 

is indicated if the label stock (23) is removed. A release 
liner (28) may cover the permanent pressure sensitive 

adhesive, or paper stock (32) having a second tie coat (33) 
with repositional adhesive (34) over the tie coat may be 

provided engaging the permanent pressure sensitive adhesive 
(127).

<DESCRIPTION>
There are many situations in which it is highly desirable 
to be able to determine if a label has been tampered with. For 
example, if the label is to provide a price or other indicator 
of characteristics of an object and is applied to the object, it 
is highly desirable to know if the label is removed from the 
object. Similar concerns apply to documents, containers which 
are desirably sealed before use, and in a wide variety of other 
environments; that is, in such environments, the fact that a 
label has been tampered with is extremely useful information. According to the present invention a label, and a method of 
production thereof, are provided which indicate clearly if the 
label has been tampered With, and also prevent the re-application 
(except in a tamper evident mode) of the label once it has been 
removed. US-A-4721638, equivalent to FR-A-2570986, describes a label 
in accordance with the preamble of claim 1. The present invention provides a security label comprising: 
label stock having a top face and bottom face; a release coat 
provided on said label stock bottom face; a first non-opaque tie coat provided on said release coat;  
 a coat of pressure sensitive permanent adhesive provided on said 
first tie coat, said first tie coat having substantially greater 
affinity for said permanent adhesive than for said release coat; 
said permanent adhesive having a greater affinity for a surface 
to which it is applied than said first tie coat has for said 
release coat; indicia provided on said first tie coat 
substantially between said permanent adhesive and said first tie 
coat; characterised by a sheet stock having first and second 
faces, said first face engaging said permanent adhesive; a second 
tie coat on said sheet stock second face; and repositional 
adhesive on said second tie coat, the repositional adhesive 
having a greater affinity for a surface to which it is to be 
applied than the first tie coat has for the release coat. The indicia comprises reverse printed alphanumeric 
characters such as those indicating a problem situation (e.g., 
the word "void" or "fraud" or "danger", etc.). The label may be 
a linerless label, having a release coat on the top face of the 
label stock, as well as informational indicia, and a release 
liner may be provided covering the pressure sensitive adhesive. In this construction, the repositional adhesive would also 
allow the label to be clearly removed from most surfaces but 
would provide a security feature if the label stock was removed,

<CLAIMS>
A security label (22) comprising: 

label stock (23) having a top face and bottom face; a 
release coat (24) provided on said label stock bottom face; 

a first non-opaque tie coat (25) provided on said release 
coat; 
a coat of pressure sensitive permanent adhesive (27) 
provided on said first tie coat, said first tie coat having 

substantially greater affinity for said permanent adhesive 
than for said release coat; said permanent adhesive having 

a greater affinity for a surface to which it is applied 
than said first tie coat has for said release coat; indicia 

(26) provided on said first tie coat substantially between 
said permanent adhesive and said first tie coat; 

characterised by a sheet stock (32) having first and second 
faces, said first face engaging said permanent adhesive 

(27); a second tie coat (33) on said sheet stock second 
face; and repositional adhesive (34) on said second tie 

coat, the repositional adhesive having a greater affinity 
for a surface (30) to which it is to be applied than the 

first tie coat (25) has for the release coat (24). 
A label as recited in claim 1 wherein said pressure 
sensitive adhesive (27) is opaque. 
A label as recited in claim 1 or claim 2 characterised in 
that said indicia (26) comprises reverse printed  

 
alphanumeric characters. 
A label as recited in any of claims 1 to 3 characterised in 
that said indicia comprise alphanumeric characters 

indicating a problem situation. 
A label as recited in any of claims 1 to 4 characterised by 
further indicia (29) imaged on said top face of said label 

stock. 
A label as recited in any of claims 1 to 5 characterised by 
a release liner releasably covering the repositional 

adhesive, said repositional adhesive having a greater 
affinity for its associated tie coat than for said release 

liner. 
A label as recited in any of claims 1 to 5 characterised by 
a release coat (36) provided on said label stock top face. 
A method of making a label from label stock having top and 
bottom faces, comprising the steps of: 


(a) applying a release coat to the label stock bottom 
face; 
(b) applying a first non-opaque tie coat to the release 
coat; 
(c) printing security indicia on the first tie coat; 
(d) coating the printing and first tie coat with pressure 
sensitive permanent adhesive; characterised by  

 
(e) applying a first face of a sheet stock to the 
permanent adhesive, 
(f) applying a second tie coat to the second face of the 
sheet stock and 
(g) applying a repositional adhesive to the second tie 
coat. 
A method as recited in claim 8 comprising the further step 
of covering the repositional adhesive with a release liner.
