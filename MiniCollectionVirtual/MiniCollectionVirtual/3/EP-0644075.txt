<ABSTRACT>
A blind unit for a glazed area, especially 
the sun roof of a motor vehicle, comprises a cover 

member (26) which can be moved to any desired setting 
between extended and retracted limit positions. The 

cover member (26) is maintained in spring-loaded 
equilibrium throughout the course of its travel by the 

provision of a tensioning mechanism at each side of the 
cover member. Each tensioning mechanism comprises a 

flexible strap (32a, 32b) which runs from a roller tube 
(20), around a spring-biassed movable bobbin (34a, 

34b), and back to a support tube (28) at the leading 
edge of the cover member. The springs for the bobbins 

(34a, 34b) are housed within guide tubes (16a, 16b) at 
each side of the unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to blinds 
and is particularly concerned with blinds which are 
intended for use in vehicles, for use in conjunction 
with glazed areas, especially in the roof and sides of 
a vehicle. The term "glazed" is intended to include 
not just glass areas but also areas of transparent or 
translucent plastics material. There is a need in motor vehicles for sun 
blinds to be used in conjunction with glazed roof 
areas, in particular for screening purposes. 
Conventional sun blinds suffer from a number of 
disadvantages. The conventional blind for use in a 
vehicle comprises a spring-loaded roller blind which is 
secured by a latch mechanism. When the latch mechanism 
is released the blind retracts automatically to its 
housed position. With such blinds it is not possible 
to position the blind in an intermediate position: the 
blind is either fully extended or fully retracted. 
Also, the use of a latch normally requires a knob or 
handle projecting into the interior of the vehicle, and 
this can be a safety hazard. Also, it is not always 
easy for the user to operate the latch, particularly if 
it is to be operated by the driver while driving. In 
certain vehicles, with a wide glazed roof area, two 
separate blinds are used, in side-by-side relationship, 
with a central gap between them. This central gap is 
necessary in order to accommodate the winding mechanism 
for the sun roof which intrudes into the vehicle cabin. 
Compatibility of a vehicle sun blind with the winding 
mechanism for the sun roof is a problem in many 
vehicles. It is an object of the present invention to 
provide an improved blind unit for use in conjunction 
with a glazed area, especially within a vehicle, which 
overcomes or at least minimises the disadvantages set  
 
out above. It is a further object to provide a blind 
unit which will accommodate a wide range of 
temperatures and still function satisfactorily. A 
temperature range of -40°C to +50°C must be withstood. 
The problem is that the housing expands and contracts 
differently from the adjacent steel components. The 
blind unit must adapt to this. In accordance with the present invention 
there is provided a blind unit for a glazed area, 
comprising a cover member which can be moved to any 
desired setting between extended and retracted limit 
positions, characterised in that tensioning means are 
provided which maintain the cover member in spring-loaded 
equilibrium throughout the course of its travel 
between the said limit positions. In this

<CLAIMS>
A blind unit for a glazed area, comprising 
a cover member (26) which can be moved to any desired 

setting between extended and retracted limit positions, 
characterised in that tensioning means (32a, 32b, 34a, 

34b, 46) are provided which maintain the cover member 

(26) in spring-loaded equilibrium throughout the course 
of its travel between the said limit positions. 
A blind unit as claimed in claim 1, 
characterised in that the tensioning means comprises a 

linkage (32a, 32b) on each side of the cover member 
(26) between an elongate roller (20) on which the cover 

member is wound at the one end and means (28) 
supporting the leading edge of the cover member at the 

other end, with spring means (46) to maintain tension 
in the linkages. 
A blind unit as claimed in claim 2, 
characterised in that the linkages comprise flexible 

straps (32a, 32b). 
A blind unit as claimed in claim 2 or 3, 
characterised in that a guide tube (16a, 16b) is 

provided adjacent to and parallel to each side of the 
cover member (26), the spring means (46) is housed 

within the respective guide tubes, and each spring 
means acts through a bobbin (34a, 34b) movable 

lengthwise of the guide tube to maintain said tension. 
A blind unit as claimed in claim 4, 
characterised in that each guide tube has a slot (40) 

therein, each bobbin (34a, 34b) has an extension (38) 
projecting into the adjacent slot, a plunger (42) 

within the guide tube is secured to the extension (38), 
and a compression spring (46) acts on the plunger (42). 
A blind unit as claimed in any of claims 2 
to 5, characterised in that the elongate roller (20) is 

at one end of the unit, the spring means (46) is at the 
 

other end of the unit, and the linkages (32a, 32b) run 
from the roller (20) to the spring means (46) and back 

to the means (28) supporting the leading edge of the 
cover member. 
A blind unit as claimed in claim 4 or 5, 
characterised in that the guide tubes (16a, 16b) 

provide support both for the elongate roller (20) on 
which the cover member (26) is wound and also for a 

support tube (28) fixed to the leading edge of the 
cover member.
