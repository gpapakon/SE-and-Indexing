<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a curable resin
composition comprising a saturated hydrocarbon polymer having at
least one silicon-containing group which has at least one hydroxyl
or hydrolyzable group bonded to a silicon atom and is crosslinkable
through the formation of a siloxane bond (hereinafter referred to as
a "reactive silicon-containing group").It is known that saturated hydrocarbon polymers having
at least one reactive silicon-containing group in a molecule have
interesting properties that they are crosslinked through the
formation of siloxane bonds which is associated with the hydrolysis
of reactive silicon-containing groups with moisture even at room
temperature, and provide rubbery cured materials. Such polymers
are useful as sealing materials for construction or sealing
materials for insulating glass units, since they have excellent heat
resistance, water resistance, weather resistance and the like.The sealing materials for construction are required to
have good handling properties and workability, since they are
applied at construction sites using caulking guns and the like. The
sealing materials for insulating glass units are discharged using
applicators, that is, apparatuses for discharging sealing materials,
in factories for insulating glass units. In this case, good
workability with good discharging properties is required for the
sealing materials. However, saturated hydrocarbon polymers such as
polyisobutylene have high viscosity and thus low handling
properties, when they are used as sealants such as the sealing
materials for construction or insulating glass units. Thus, they are
plasticized by the addition of hydrogenated polybutene, paraffinic
oils, naphthenic oils, and the like. However, the use of such
plasticizers may be associated with some problems, for example,
large heating loss, insufficient plasticizing effects, low flowability
at tow temperatugre, etc. Because of the low flowability at low
temperature, the sealing materials for construction, which have to
be applied at the construction sites, are attended with low
extrudability or workability In winter seasons.EP-A-252 372 discloses a curable isobutylene polymer having at
least one silicon-containing group crosslinkable by the formation of
siloxane bond. This polymer may contain as a plasticizer, among
others, a hydrogenated polybutene (a polymer of isobutene) or a
liquid hydrogenated polybutadiene.JP-A-1-163 255 describes a curable composition comprising a
saturated hydrocarbon-based polymer having a hydroxyl group or
