<ABSTRACT>
A medium is retained in the predetermined mutual spaced relation in a gap between two plane faces on respective bodies. The bodies are mutually displaceable in a direction substantially perpendicular to the gap and biassed in the direction of displacement. One of the bodies is connected with a compressed air source providing through a plurality of outlets in the plane face of the respective body an air cushion between the face and the medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a method and a device for retaining 
a thin medium in a predetermined spaced relation in a gap 
between two bodies. In recent years there has been a tremendous development in 
the printing industry, since a considerable part of the 
image processing is now performed by means of a computer. 
For example in offset printing the image information 
stored in a computer is transferred to a standard offset 
plate which is then used in a generally known printing 
unit which prints the desired number of copies. Since the 
image information is stored in the store of a computer, it 
is desirable to transfer the digitized data to the photosensitive 
medium, which may e.g. be a standard offset 
plate, photosensitive paper or film, and the transmission 
is to be performed with the best possible resolution. Originally, the medium was illuminated through a partly 
transparent original containing the desired information. 
Since the processes are now computerized, use has so far 
been made of a laser beam which scans the medium for exposure, 
while the laser beam is modulated for the medium to 
obtain the correct illumination in all points. The information 
on the illumination pattern of the medium is now 
contained in a central control unit and is used for modulating 
the laser. For a satisfactory image quality to be 
obtained on the medium, the mechanical system retaining 
the original and the light source with respect to each 
other during exposure must satisfy strict stability requirements. 
For the required accuracy to be obtained, the 
medium for exposure is often arranged in a device of the 
type usually called "Internal Laser Image Drum Plotter".  
 Devices of this type are described i.a. in US patent specifications 
4 852 709, 4 595 957 and 3 958 250. Devices of 
this type provide a satisfactory image quality, but they 
have a very complex mechanical structure, because the 
light source and the medium are to be moved very accurately 
with respect to each other. Consequently, devices of 
this type have a relatively high cost price, which puts a 
limit to the number of users. With a view to faster and better exposure of the medium, 
electronic chips have been developed by means of which a 
plurality of selectively modulatable light channels can be 
formed. These chips may be used for building a rod transversely 
to the medium for exposure, so that the medium is 
illuminated in a coherent line in its entire width. This 
type of equipment is known e.g. from US patent 4 899 222, 
US 5 030 970

<CLAIMS>
A method for retaining a thin medium in a predetermined 
mutual spaced relation in a gap between two faces on 

respective bodies, 
characterized
 by arranging 
the bodies mutually displaceably in a direction substantially 

perpendicular to the portion of the gap where the 
spaced relation is to be maintained, biassing the bodies 

in the direction of displacement, at least one body being 
subjected to a force acting toward the other body, and 

forming an air cushion between the face of at least one 
body and the medium, at least one body being connected 

with a source of compressed air having a plurality of compressed 
air outlets in the face for establishing the pressure 

cushion. 
A device for retaining a thin medium (16) in a predetermined 
spaced relation in a gap between two faces on 

respective bodies (100, 120; 200, 220; 300, 320), 
characterized
 
in that the bodies (100, 120; 200; 

220; 300, 320) are mutually displaceable in a direction 
substantially perpendicular to at least the portion of the 

gap where the spaced relation is to be maintained, that 
the bodies are biassed in the direction of displacement, 

at least one body being subjected to a force directed toward 
the other body, and that at least one of the bodies 

is connected with a source of compressed air (270; 370) 
forming through one or more outlets (160; 260; 360) in the 

faces of the respective body (100; 200; 300) an air 
cushion between the face and the medium (16). 
A device according to claim 2, wherein the thin medium 
(16) is a photosensitive medium for exposure, 
characterized
 
in that one body (100; 200; 300) 

serves as a support for the medium (16), that the other  
 

body (120; 220; 320) is provided with an exposure device 
(124; 224; 324) extending transversely to the medium (16), 

and that the distance between the medium and the exposure 
device (124; 224; 324) of the other body (120; 220; 320) 

is kept constant, while the exposure device (124; 224; 
324) is caused to illuminate the medium (16) during mutual 

movement between the medium (16) and the other body (120; 
220; 320). 
A device according to claim 2 or 3, 
characterized
 
in that the first body (200) is coated with 

a resilient material, such as foamed plastics, on the face 
directed toward the medium (16). 
A device according to claims 2-4, 
characterized
 
in that the first body (200) has a plane engagement 

face for the medium (16), and that the first body 
(200) is arranged on rails (280) in parallel with the 

engagement face so as to be slidable along the rails while 
the medium (16) is exposed by the exposure device (224) of 

the second body (220) while said second body (220) is 
essentially retained. 
A device according to claim 3, 
characterized
 
in that the first and the second bodies (100,

drum on which the medium is arranged externally and is retained 
by means of vacuum from a source of vacuum (340) so
