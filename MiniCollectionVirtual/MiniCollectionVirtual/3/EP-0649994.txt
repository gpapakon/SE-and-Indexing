<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to 
mechanisms for connecting and locking, connecting and 
unlocking, and connecting and holding two surfaces 
utilizing a canted-coil spring. More particularly, 
the surfaces may be cylindrical or spherical; and 
electromagnetic shielding, electrical conductivity, 
heat dissipation and environmental sealing may also be 
effected through the use of the present invention. Canted-coil springs suitable for the present 
invention and a description thereof, along with the 
loading characteristics of such springs, may be found 
in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,655,462; 4,826,144; 4,830,344; 
4,876,781; 4,893,795; 4,907,788; 4,915,366; 4,934,666; 
4,961,253; 4,964,204; 4,974,821; 5,072,070; 5,079,388; 
5,108,078; 5,117,066; 5,134,244; 5,160,122; 5,161,806; 
and 5,203,849. All of these patents have been issued 
to Peter J. Balsells. In addition, the hereinabove referenced issued 
patents 
describe, in general, electromagnetic 
shielding effectiveness of coil spring assemblies, 
particularly U.S. Patent Nos. 4,934,666; 
5,079,388; and 5,134,244. The present invention provides for a mechanism 
suitable for many mechanical and electrical applications. 
In particular, in electrical applications, the 
greatest suitability for the present invention  
 
combines environmental sealing with enhanced electrical 
conductivity. The use of an elastomer 
with a spring in intimate contact with surrounding 
coils achieves enhanced environmental 
sealing. The intimate contact between loaded points 
also inhibits foreign material, such as moisture, 
dust or oxidation that may be present, thus providing 
an effective environmental seal. A connect/disconnect, lock/unlock, snap-on fastening 
and hold mechanism for mechanical, electromagnetic 
shielding, electrical conductivity and thermal 
dissipation, with further provision for environmental 
sealing, in accordance with the present invention, 
generally includes a cylindrical or spherical body 
having a circumferential grove therein with generally 
parallel side walls. A continuous coil spring is provided 
and disposed in the circumferential groove with 
a portion thereof protruding from the circumferential 
groove. Further, in accordance with the present invention, 
a housing is provided which has a bore sized to 
accommodate the cylindrical or spherical body. 
Groove means, disposed on an inside surface of the 
bore, are provided for receiving the protruding spring 
portion and for enabling assembly of the cylindrical 
or spherical body within the
