<ABSTRACT>
The part holder (1) for workstations with a revolving 
table has a first prism-shaped supporting element (2) and at 

least one second supporting element (3) which is adapted to 
support parts to be machined. The holder comprises locator 

5 pins (7a,7b) for positioning the second supporting element 
(2) on a lateral face (4) of the first supporting element 

(2) and protrusions (9) for removably locking the second 
supporting element (2) on the face (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a part holder
particularly for workstations or machining centers with a
revolving table. FR-A-2 691 659 discloses a part holder as
defined in the precharacterizing portion of the appended
claim 1.It is known that the evolution of machine tools for the
machining of metal and nonmetallic parts by chip-forming has
led to the production of increasingly complicated and
sophisticated workstations in which it is possible to
subject the parts to various machining operations. More
particularly, these workstations are usually provided with a
holder that is substantially shaped like a parallelepiped
with a square base, and the parts to be machined are rigidly
coupled, by virtue of suitable locking devices, to the
lateral faces of said holder, so that the tools of the
workstation, which are appropriately moved along at least
two mutually perpendicular axes, can reach the parts with
high precision and machine them.Some workstations include a table which generally
revolves about a vertical axis and on which the holder is
placed so that the tools can move towards the parts mounted
on the holder not only by virtue of the movement of said
tools but also by virtue of the rotation of the holder about
said vertical axis.Workstations obviously require considerable investments
which can be amortized, and thus lead to an economically
advantageous activity, only if machining downtimes, such as
for example the time required to mount the parts on the
holder or remove them from it, are minimized.The current trend is to provide holders that can carry 
a large number of parts and to have at least two holders,
also known as pallets, which are alternately placed on the
revolving table of the workstation. In this manner, while
the workstation is machining one batch of parts, it is
possible to mount the next batch of parts on the other
holder, which replaces the first one once its parts have
been machined. In this way it is possible to minimize
machining downtimes but there is the drawback of having to
purchase two or more holders which are relatively expensive
because they are very high precision products.In some cases it is also necessary to manufacture a
special holder for particular parts to be machined. In such
cases, the holder, after a small number of runs, is
generally stored until the next request for special parts.
In this case, in addition to the high purchase cost of such
holders, there is also the problem of additional costs, that
is to say losses, linked to nonuse of the holder.Another

Part holder (1), particularly for workstations with
a revolving table, supporting parts (40) to be subjected to

a machining operation, comprising:

a first prism-shaped supporting element (2);
at least one second supporting element (3), adapted to
carry the parts (40) to be machined;
means (7,8) for positioning said second supporting
element (3) on a lateral face (4) of said first supporting

element; and
means (9,10,11-14) for removably locking said second
supporting element (3) on said face (4), said removably locking

means (9-14) being adapted for applying a force on said second
supporting element (3) in a direction perpendicular to said

face (4);
the part holder (1) being 
characterized in that
 said
positioning means (7,8) and said locking means (9-14) each comprise

protruding elements (7a,7b;9) removably insertable into
corresponding recessed elements (8a,8b;10) which

have a lower wider portion and an upper narrower portion such
that the protruding elements are first engageable in the wider

portions of the recessed elements (8a,8b;10) when the second supporting
element (3) is being initially positioned on the lateral face (4) of

the first supporting element (2) and such that the protruding
elements (7a,7b;9) are subsequently engageable in the narrower portions

of the recessed elements (8a,8b;10) after a vertical downward movement
of the second supporting element (3) with respect to the first

supporting element (2).
Holder according to claim 1, characterized in that
said removable locking means (11-14) are of the

automatically actuated type.
Holder according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said first supporting element 

(2) is substantially shaped like a parallelepiped with a
square base and in that each one of the lateral faces (4) of

said first supporting element is provided with said
protruding elements (7a,7b;9) of said positioning means

and said locking means which can removably engage said
recessed elements (8a,8b;10) provided on said

second supporting element (3).
Holder according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said second supporting element

(3) is substantially shaped like a parallelepiped in which
one end face (6) is meant to support the parts (40) to be

machined and the other end face (5) is provided with said
recessed elements (8a,8b;10) for engaging said

protruding elements (7a,7b;9) of said positioning
means and said locking means.
Holder according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said protruding

elements of said positioning means comprise two tabs (7a,7b)
which protrude from each lateral face (4) of said first

supporting element (2) and are aligned along a vertical
direction, said recessed elements of said

positioning means comprising two seats (8a,8b) which are
formed in the end face (5) of said second supporting element

(3) that is meant to be directed towards said first
supporting element (2), said seats being engageable by said

tabs.
Holder according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said protruding

elements of said locking means comprise protrusions (9) that
protrude from the lateral faces (4) of said first supporting 

element (2), can be inserted in said recessed
elements of said locking means comprising recesses (10)

(3), and have shoulders (9a) which are directed towards said

first supporting element (2) and can engage abutments (10a)

formed in said recesses, means (11-14) being provided for
actuating said protrusions to move them along a direction

that lies substantially at right angles to the corresponding
lateral face of said first supporting element in order to

lock or release said second supporting element.
Holder according to claim 6, characterized in that
said actuation means are constituted by at least one

pneumatic-hydraulic cylinder (11) which is mounted on said
first supporting element.
Holder according to one or more of the preceding
claims, characterized in that said second supporting element
