<ABSTRACT>
The shelving system comprises a shelf (10), risers (20) and dividers (30). At the front of the shelf is a spring loaded gripping member (40) for accommodating the riser (20) which is provided with a number of slots (22) which engage about rods or shanks (42) of the gripping member (40). The rear face of the shelf is provided with an up-stand (50) which provides a low rear wall for the shelf and provides a means to retain connector clips (60) in position. A gripping and facia element (41) is located on the heads (83) of the rods (42). The gripping member (40) has springs (43), which are contained in the housing formed by elements (44 and 45). To operate the gripping member (40), pressure is applied in the direction of arrow (Z). On release of the pressure, the assembly returns to its closed position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to shelving, particularly to 
modular metal shelving for use in retail outlets to display 
and merchandise consumer products for general use 
throughout the retail industry. Such shelving is used in 
ambient and refrigerated conditions. A necessary feature of such shelving is the provision of 
means to accommodate shelf sub-division elements known in the 
industry as 'risers and dividers' which are used to 
subdivide a shelf into separate areas to hold different 
types of goods in isolation, prevent the goods from mixing 
and in the case of sloping shelves from falling off the 
shelves. These risers and dividers can be made of many materials but 
generally are of either glass, transparent plastics 
materials or wire construction in the form of a flat grid, 
all of which allow the product displayed on the shelf to be 
seen through the risers/dividers. By definition the 
'risers' are the sub-divider elements fixed to the front 
and back of the shelf while the 'dividers' are the 
adjustable sub-divider elements which run from the front to 
the back of the shelf and are connected to, and supported 
by, the riser elements by means of various connectors. Prior art shelves have been designed in numerous different 
ways to accommodate the fixing and supporting of riser 
elements of the various materials described above. Two 
solutions have emerged which dominate the retail metal 
shelving markets viz: 
Type A:Shelving with recessed narrow channels formed  
 
along the front and back of the shelves to 
accommodate the riser elements (see prior art 
Figure A) Type B:Shelving with small holes or slots punched 
along the front and back of the shelves at close 
intervals in lines parallel to and close to the 
edges of the shelf to accommodate pins fixed to 
or forming part of the risers. In this case, it 
is also necessary to provide a second perforated 
landing under the shelf proper to accept the pins 
and give the riser stability not provided by the 
thin metal of the shelf (see prior art Figure B)  
A variation of the type A shelf is disclosed in DE-B-1102545 in 
which a biasing clip is included in the front and rear channels. Shelf types 'A' and 'B' constitute the vast majority off all 
modular metal shelves produced commercially and the 
remaining shelf types either have no means to accommodate 
risers and dividers or feature variations of the retaining 
shelf types 'A' or 'B'. There are a number of disadvantages associated with the 
prior art shelving namely: 
(a) Type 'A'

<CLAIMS>
An elongate gripping member (40) for a shelf (10) 
having a planer surface, comprising means (42) for 

securing the gripping member to an edge of the shelf, 
means (44,45) for moving the gripping member from the 

edge and biasing means (43) for urging the gripping 
member towards said edge, characterised in that the means 

(44,45) for moving the gripping member allows the 
gripping member (40) to be extended from the shelf, 

whereby the gripping member (40) may be extended from the 

shelf to accommodate a riser (20, 20x, 20y, 20z) and/or 
other element (R, S, 120) and released to grip the 

element between the edge of the shelf and the gripping 
member. 
An elongate gripping member as claimed in Claim 1, 
including an elongate gripping element (41) a housing 

(44,45) for the biasing means (43) and a plurality of 
rods (42) extending between the housing (44,45) and the 

gripping element (41), one end (82) of each rod (42) 
being fixed to the housing (44) and the other end of each 

rod (42) being removably engaged with the gripping 
element (41) which is movable between a pair of travel 

stops (47) under and against the action of the biasing 
means (43). 
An elongate gripping member as claimed in either 
Claim 1 or 2, in which the housing comprises a pair of 

co-operating housing elements (44,45) having 
complementary engageable formations (47) which allow the 

shaped elements to engage but which prevent separation of 
the elements.  

 
A shelf having a planer surface and a longitudinal 
gripping member as claimed in Claim 1, provided along at 

least one edge of the shelf. 
A shelf as claimed in Claim 4, in which the edge of 
the shelf is provided with a depending skirt (11) along 

which are provided a plurality of orifices (13), and the 
gripping member includes an elongate gripping element 

(41) and a plurality of rods (42) each of which extends 
through an orifice in the skirt (11) and is engaged with 

the elongate gripping element (41) which is movable 
between a pair of travel stops (47) under and against the 

action of the biasing means (43) located beneath the 
planer surface of the shelf (10) and adjacent the skirt 

(11). 
A shelf as claimed in Claim 5, in which the travel 
stops (47) are provided about the rods (42) and one end 

(82) of each rod is removably engaged with the elongate 
gripping element (41) so that the rods are movable with 

the gripping element. 
A shelf as claimed in Claim 5 or Claim 6, in which 
the depending skirt (11) of the shelf is provided with a 

return so as to form a substantially U-shaped profile at 
the edge of the shelf and the rods (42) extend through a 

housing (44,45) located within the U-shaped profile, said 
housing having at least one of the travel stops (47). 
A shelf as claimed in Claim 7, in which the housing 
comprises a pair of co-operating housing elements (44, 

45) having complementary engageable formations (47) which 
allow the housing elements to engage but which prevent 

separation of the elements.  
 
A shelf as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 8, in 
which the gripping member (40) is provided along a front 

edge of the shelf (10) and in upstand (50) is provided it 
the rear edge of the shelf so as to provide a low rear 

wall. 
A shelf as claimed in any one of Claims 5 to 9, in 
which a resilient connector clip (60) is removably 

provided along at least one edge of the shelf, the clip 
having means for securing thereto a portion of a divider 

(30) positioned on the surface of the shelf. 
A shelf is claimed in any of Claims 5 to 10, in 
which the gripping element (41) is provided with a 

channel (85) for accommodating heads (83) of the rods 
(42) of the gripping member. 
A shelf as claimed in any one of Claims 4 to 11, in 
which an outer facia element (95, 105, 159) in removably 

attached to the gripping member. 
A shelf is claimed in Claim 9, in which the outer 
facia element includes a retainer (76, 86, 95, 105, 145) 

for merchandising matter.
