<ABSTRACT>
Production of fertilizer granules of organic materials, with a long life are shaped into small diameter spheres. A mass to be pulverized is formed at least of dry organic matter, to be stirred with an organic liquid bonding agent. The stirring is continued after pulverizing, for a time span according to the size of the granules to be developed. To produce fertilizer granules, the mass for pulverizing is of organic materials of different characteristics. The stirring action is by rolling the organic material among itself. The organic liquid is fed into the mass by pulverizing it with the organic material, with the liquid feed assisted by the stirring action. The organic liquid bonding agent is a fermentation of beetroot juice. The stirring action moves the material up and down, to separate the granules, combined with a rolling action. The granule density is increased by drying their surfaces, combined with rolling the granules among themselves, followed by core drying in stages. An Independent claim is included for an installation to produce organic fertilizer granules, with a mixing vat (2) and the feeds for the different materials. The vat has sealed openings for the feed of the ingredients, and the removal of the mixture. The vat has a spray assembly (3) linked to the supply of the fermented beetroot juice for bonding. A stirrer (12) separates the granules, downstream of the mixer, with a rotating vat with inlet and outlet openings. It has a number of spaced longitudinal projections, pitched at an angle to act on the granules and direct them on a downwards path. The density of the granules is increased by a stage (14), downstream of the separator, as a horizontal vat rotating around its longitudinal axis. It has a number of internal projections to act on the granules, and has a hot air flow through it from the entry to the exit. A final drying station (15) has an entry and an exit for the granules to pass through. The mixer vessel is static, and has a rotating mixing unit (10) with a rotating shaft axially within it, connected to a drive motor. The final drying stage has a horizontal and tubular shape, rotating around its longitudinal axis. It has internal paddles to stir and aerate the granules. The separation and drying stages are pitched at downward angles, for the granules to roll by gravity from the entry to the exit ends. The installation can have two final drying stage, where the upstream unit has a lower drying temperature than its downstream counterpart. A buffer hopper (8) is between the material feed and the mixer. The bulk delivery of the materials is at a feed station (1), with a spreader (4) to pass them into a feed hopper (5) to be weighed before passing into the buffer hopper. The fermented beetroot juice is held in a sealed vessel (7), linked to a supply circuit connected to the sprays through a buffer hopper (9). A buffer hopper (13) is between the mixer and the separation stage.
