<ABSTRACT>
Detoxification of humans who have been exposed to 
phosphylating agents, and decontamination of a locus containing 

phosphylating agents (e.g. organophosphorus insecticides or 
organophosphorus nerve gases), are effected by administration to 

the humans or applying to the locus, respectively, at least one 
recombinant cholinesterase mutant so as to form phosphylated 

cholinesterase mutant, in presence of intrinsic or extrinsic 
reactivator activity effective to reactivate the mutant by 

breaking the phosphyl/cholinesterase mutant covalent bond, the 
phosphylated mutant being more readily reconverted to nonphosphylated 

mutant, than the corresponding phosphylated non-mutated 
cholinesterase is reconverted to non-phosphylated non-mutated 

cholinesterase. Mutation sites in the amino acid 
sequence of HuAChE, or in equivalent positions in other 

cholinesterases, are preferably selected from at least one of (a)

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of recombinant 
cholinesterase mutants for detoxification and decontamination of 
toxic organophosphorus compounds by converting them into 
phosphylated recombinant cholinesterase mutants, from which the 
non-phosphylated mutants are regenerated more readily than non-mutated 
cholinesterases are regenerated from phosphylated non-mutated 
cholinesterases; and to related compositions, 
pharmaceutical formulations, and phosphylated and nonphosphylated 
recombinant cholinesterase mutants. Cholinesterases (ChE's) are readily phosphylated, at 
the active site serine, by a variety of organophosphonates and 
organophosphates. In this connection, the term "phosphyl" in the 
present specification and claims denotes all tetravalent 
phosphorus electrophilic groups (c.f. Bourne, N. and Williams, A. 
(1984) J. Am. Chem. 
Soc. 16, 7591-7596) and 
terms derived 
therefrom such as "phosphylation" and "phosphylated" have the 
corresponding meanings as will be understood by persons skilled 
in the art. The conjugates formed from ChE and organophosphonates 
or organophosphates (which terms as used herein include the 
analogs containing 1-3 sulfur atoms instead of the corresponding 
number of oxygen atoms) then undergo postinhibitory processes, 
the nature and extent of which depend upon the structure of the 
inhibitor and the particular enzyme studied. Spontaneous 
reactivation, through displacement of the phosphyl moiety (Scheme  
 
1) from the active site, is usually very slow; however the enzyme 
can be reactivated by various oxime nucleophiles, see Aldrich, 
W.N., and Reiner, E., (1972) Enzyme Inhibitors as Substrates, 
North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam, and Froede, H.C., and 
Wilson, I.B., (1971) in: The Enzymes, Vol.5, 3rd Ed. (Boyer, 
P.D., Ed.), pp 87-114, Academic Press, Orlando FL. Accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor 
sites as a result of AChE inhibition due to phosphylation, 
produces effects equivalent to excessive stimulation of these 
receptors, throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. 
The cholinergic crisis thus produced is characterized by miosis, 
increased salivary and tracheobronchial secretions, bradycardia, 
muscle weakness, fasiculations, and convulsions, resulting in 
death by respiratory failure. It has previously been proposed to treat poisoning due 
to toxic phosphylating compounds, with a method consisting of 
pretreatment with a reversible ChE inhibitor, followed by 
treatment with a combination of atropine (to
