<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
electrophotographic image forming apparatus and a method of
assembling such an apparatus.Here, the image forming apparatus includes a
laser beam printer, LED printer, an electrophotographic
copying machine, word processor and the like.In widely used image forming apparatus of an
electrophotographic type, an image bearing member is
rotated to form a toner image, and in synchronism with
the rotation of the image bearing member, a feeding
means is driven to feed a recording material. The
toner image is transferred onto the recording
material, and is fixed by fixing means.In such an image forming apparatus, an
electrical component board for controlling various
parts is provided in the apparatus, usually adjacent a
bottom of the apparatus. Therefore, in the assembling
operation, the electrical component board is first
mounted through a top opening of the apparatus frame,
and thereafter, various parts such as transfer roller
or fixing device are sequentially mounted. An apparatus containing an optical means, the
feeding means and image forming means is housed by an
outer cover. Here, separate outer covers are used for
the front and rear parts or for the fixing device
part.In an electrophotographic type, a light image
is projected onto the image bearing member to form a
latent image thereon. A mirror for reflecting the
light image is mounted on the frame, and usually, a
top part of the mirror is covered by the outer cover.The outer cover is mounted at the last stage
after the various parts are built in the frame. Since
the outer cover is composed of separate parts, and
therefore, the covers are required to be threaded with 
the result of time consuming operations.Accordingly, it is a principal concern of the
present invention to provide an image forming apparatus
and an assembling method of an image forming apparatus,
in which the assembling operation is easy.One aspect of the present invention is more
particularly concerned with a method of assembling an
electrophotographic image forming apparatus for forming
an image on a recording material, the method including
the steps of using a main frame having a right way up,
mounting on the frame a feeding unit having a feeding
roller for feeding the recording material, mounting on
the frame an electrical component unit having electrical
components of the apparatus, and mounting on the frame
an outer cover. Such a method is apparent from patent
document EP-A-0496400.The method of said one aspect of the present
invention is
