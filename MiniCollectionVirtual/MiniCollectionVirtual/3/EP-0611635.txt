<ABSTRACT>
A manually operated device for cutting strips from a floor covering, especially a carpet strip cutter, is shown and described, having a knife (1) which is supported by a guide rod (5) and having a cutting stop (2) to which the guide rod (5) is fastened in a longitudinally adjustable fashion and which engages beneath the floor covering by means of a lower limb (3). To facilitate handling, provision is made for the lower limb (3) to be equal in length to the maximum cutting width which can be set and for the knife (1) to be capable of being pivoted downwards until its cutting edge (11) strikes the lower limb (3).
