<ABSTRACT>
Method in a digital wide area system operating in time division and comprising two or several subsystems, each of which comprises at least one central station (CS) and one or several peripheral stations (PS) and covering an area/volume (space) where the area covered basically depends on the radio optical coverage of each central station and underlaying peripheral stations, the communication within and between subsystems that are geographically spread out is created at each central station. A central station is controlled to change mode of operation to operate either as a central station for transmitting and receiving information to and from underlaying peripheral stations, or receiving and transmitting information as a peripheral station (PS) from and to another central station.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Method in a TDMA radiosystem to let a central station communicate with both peripheral stations and other central stations.The invention relates to a method and a system for a dynamically alternating radio station. 5 In systems utilizing a TDMA frame structure, that is time division with or without resource sharing i the space each system is divided into subsystems. Resource sharing in time and space of a common frequency band for spread out subscribers in a radio network provides a possibility for10 several stations to cooperate and to function simultaneously at a specific frequency band. Each radio network comprises several central stations (CS) and peripheral stations (PS) connected to and working under said central stations. Each central station and associated15 peripheral stations constitute a subsystem. The systems function in different embodiments in time duplex or frequency duplex with some kind of time frame structure, for instance TDMA. In different system implementations the structure is determined with regard to transmission delay20 and to the application information in each time frame. The capacity demand decides the number of time slots in each time frame, etc. Such systems are disclosed in PCT/89/SE/00470, PCT/SE90/00681 and PCT/SE91/526.Said documents do not disclose any systems providing25 repeating radio functions, radio network branching structures, CS-CS-communication, frame synchronization, functions that will all allow the utilization of a specific frequency band by only one radio transmitter and one radio receiver. Furthermore, no method is disclosed for arranging * 30 communication and transfer information between different CS -f- that do not terminate at common station location.-* Other existing wide area radio systems functioning according to TDM/TDMA in frequency duplex in fixed applications are for instance SR 500 manufactured by SR35 Telecom, Kanada and other similar systems functioning according to a time division principle having repeating 

functions. Systems of this type work in TDM mode from a central station or a repeating station towards peripheral stations in a continous mode. From peripheral stations towards a central station or a repeating station the communication is handled in "bursts", i.e. time divided into time slots between peripheral stations that under each central station and repeating station shares a specific frequency that is unique in each cell or sector. In such systems a repeating station is a repeating station during all time intervals. Repeating,
