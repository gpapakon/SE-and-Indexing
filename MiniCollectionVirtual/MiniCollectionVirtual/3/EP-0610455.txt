<ABSTRACT>
A rotating disc filter has a plurality of discs, each made of a plurality of sectors (20) removably mounted on support structures (14) which are fixed on a rotating hollow shaft (16) into core drainage channels (18) of which, the sectors drain. The drainage and support structure has flow channels (55) designed to rapidly drain filtrate and to permit filtrate split between clear and fiber bearing fractions. Rapid drainage is made possible by a novel method and device for controlling fluid transit volume within the sectors.

<DESCRIPTION>
 METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROL OF FILTRATE VOLUME IN A DISC FILTERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to rotating filter discs, and, more particularly, to filter disc sectors which have controlled internal volumes in order to limit the volume of filtrate in transit through the sectors at any time.Many disc filters are disclosed in the prior art to filter slurries in the paper and pulp industries. In larger sizes, the discs are, typically, made-up of adjacent sectors mounted on a generally hollow rotating shaft so that successive sectors of the disc are rotated into, and out of, the slurry. During the immersion of each sector in the slurry, a pressure differential is applied causing the liquid in the slurry to flow along flow channels on each sector axial surface, into a drainage bore, and thence into a core drainage channel in the hollow shaft, while a filter cake builds up on the filter bag or face wire on the outside surface of each sector. Upon emergence of a sector from the slurry, the filter cake is removed, first by ceasing application of the pressure differential, and then, by application of a knock-off shower designed to peel away the substantially dry filter cake. This cake is then collected while the sector re-enters the slurry to begin another cycle.Demands for increased filtration capacities have led to increasing filter sizes, with some commercial applications now ranging to 18' or more in diameter. For slow draining low consistency pulps (Approx. 0.5 to 2.0% solids, by weight) a large volume of liquor must be removed to significantly thicken the slurry. This liquor must be reprocessed or otherwise disposed of. Since, as the filter cake 

develops, it acts as a fine filter medium, it is expected that the first liquor collected will be less clean (or contain more fine fibers) than will that which is separated later in the cake building cycle. Thus, it would be economically beneficial to split the filtrate into fractions corresponding to its fiber content in order to reduce handling and unnecessary reprocessing costs. Ideally, all fiber-bearing filtrate would return to the feed slurry, while all fiber-free filtrate would be disposed of or re-used, as appropriate. In order to make such a split, it is necessary to drain the filtrate very rapidly in order to not mix the early (cloudy) filtrate with the later (clear) filtrate.Disc filters preferably operate within a carefully defined set of parameters which at times may appear to conflict. That is, for maximum
