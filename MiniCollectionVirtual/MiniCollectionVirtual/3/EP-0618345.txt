<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method and apparatus for 
cementing a casing string within a well bore. When a well for the production of hydrocarbons is 
drilled, it is necessary to place lengths, or strings, of 
pipe, or casing, in the well bore to various depths to permit 
the well driller to control the well while drilling operations 
are ongoing, as well as to allow control of the well while the 
hydrocarbons, or oil or gas, are being produced. These 
strings of pipe, or a casing string, are typically permanently 
installed in the well bore by cementing them to the well bore.  
 
In some instances a casing string is permanently installed, as 
by cementing, within a larger diameter casing string, or cased 
hole. As used herein, the term "well bore" means either an 
open, or drilled, bore hole, or a cased hole, which already 
has a length of casing installed therein. Typically, the 
strings of pipe, or casing string, are permanently installed 
within the well bore by pumping cement into the annular cavity 
between the outside of the pipe, or casing, and the well bore. In some instances due to well conditions, the entire 
length of casing string cannot be cemented within the well 
bore along the entire length of the casing string by pumping 
cement outwardly from the lower end of the casing string and 
then upwardly along the entire length of the casing string. 
In these instances, a down-hole tool, such as a stage 
cementing collar is disposed in the casing string between its 
upper and lower ends, generally somewhere near the middle of 
the casing string. The tool is operable to permit cement to 
be pumped outwardly through the tool and into the annular 
cavity between the casing string and the well bore. Typically 
the tool is operated to temporarily open fluid ports in the 
tool, through which the cement may pass into the annular 
cavity. The foregoing procedure is generally known in the art 
as "two-stage cementing", wherein cement is mixed and pumped 
into the annular cavity between the casing string and the well 
bore from two different locations along the length of the 
casing string, the first location being the bottom of the 
casing string, and the second location being adjacent the tool 
having the fluid ports. There are presently a variety of 
tools and methods in use to accomplish two-stage cementing. One method and apparatus for two-stage cementing involves 
dropping a weighted device down the casing string which lands 
in a sleeve in a cementing collar and seals the inner bore of 
the
