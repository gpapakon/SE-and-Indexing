<ABSTRACT>
A power transmission device is described, which 
device converts rotational movement of a rotation shaft (3) 

into reciprocal turning movement of a turning shaft (15) 
extending parallel to the rotation shaft, and which is 

simple in its mechanical construction and small in size 
of its body case. Rotational movement of a first 

rotation shaft (3) is converted into reciprocal turning 
movement of a turning shaft (15). Rotation of the first 

rotation shaft is transmitted through a second rotation 
shaft (3a) rotatable with an eccentricity to the first 

rotation shaft and a bearing (4) mounted on an end of the 
second rotation shaft to a rocking member which is 

turnable in response to only a circular displacement of 
the second rotation shaft. The swinging center of the 

rocking member (5) is fixed with a bolt (5c) or the like to the 
turning shaft extending parallel to the first rotation 

shaft. The turning shaft reciprocally turns as the 
first rotation shaft rotates.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a power 
transmission device and more particularly to a device 
for converting rotational movement of a rotation shaft 
into reciprocal turning movement of a turning shaft 
extending parallel to the rotation shaft. In dental treatment, tooth cutting is carried out 
by using cutting tools to be driven by a micromotor 
rotating at high speed. In recent years, with the 
progress of subdivision of medical areas and 
specialization of medical technology, such specialists 
that are engaged, for example, in medical treatment of 
hands or feet only have already appeared. In medical 
treatment of hands or feet, it is also necessary to 
carry out operations such as bone amputation or 
cutting, but no cutting device which is suitable for 
use in medical treatment of hands or feet, has been 
developed. Every specialist feels inconvenienced not 
having it. In view of the foregoing, the present applicant 
previously proposed a cutting device which is suitable 
for amputating and/or cutting fine bones of hands or 
feet of human or animals. The proposed cutting device  
 
is not limited to the above-mentioned application and 
can be also used for amputating and/or cutting bones of 
human, animals or other kinds of material, e.g., wood 
and so on. In a power transmission device proposed by the 
present applicant, a first rotation shaft connected to 
a rotation shaft to be driven by, for example, a 
micromotor known for use in dental treatment devices. 
The first rotation shaft is preferably connected to a 
driving portion of a motor-driven hand-piece for a 
dental treatment device, which is available on the 
market. Rotational movement of the first rotation shaft is 
transmitted through an inclined rotation transmitting 
mechanism to a second rotation shaft eccentrically 
positioned in relation to the first rotation shaft. 
The second rotation shaft is provided at its front end 
with a bearing which rotates with an eccentricity to 
the second rotation shaft to swing a rocking member 
which has, at its side opposite to the bearing, a 
concave portion having the same width in circular 
direction as the diameter of the bearing and larger 
width in radial direction than the maximum eccentricity 
of the bearing. The bearing is fitted in the concave 
portion of the rocking member. Accordingly, when the second rotation shaft  
 
rotates, the rocking member reciprocally revolves 
round its axis. The rocking member is supported by 
supporting member, for example, as fitted in a hollow 
hole

<CLAIMS>
A power transmission device for converting 
rotational movement of a rotation shaft into reciprocal 

turning movement, comprising a first rotation shaft, a 
second rotation shaft rotatable with an eccentricity 

to the first rotation shaft, a bearing mounted on an 
end of the second rotation shaft, a rocking member 

swingable in response to only a circular displacement 
of the second rotation shaft round its revolving axis, 

and a turning shaft extending parallel to the first 
rotation shaft and fixing a swinging axis of the 

rocking member, characterized in that the device 
converts rotational movement of the first rotation 

shaft into reciprocal revolving movement of the turning 
shaft.
