<ABSTRACT>
There are to be provided a process and an apparatus for the surface treatment of textiles, in which the textiles are obtained by mechanical stress on their surface, in order, for example, to produce wash-out effects, that is to say effects which can simulate a longer wearing state of a textile garment, in which process additional disposals are limited to a minimum. For this purpose, provision is made, according to the invention, for providing a container (1) with water (5) for receiving the textiles (2) to be treated, there being embedded in the water wooden bodies (7) which have such a specific gravity that they float either on and/or in a depth region of the water, there being provided an agitator device (16) which keeps the textiles to be treated in motion within the water and between the wooden bodies.
