<ABSTRACT>
For hot fixing during false-twist texturing, there is presented a reflector heater (1) which, by means of two reflector elements (3 and 4) joined in one another via a lip gasket (14), forms the heating zone (17) and which has the heating bar or heating bars (2) in the stationary reflector element (3). The reflector elements (3 to 8) are made double-walled and have a vacuum inside them. The inner walls of the reflector elements (3 to 8) are covered with a reflecting layer, for example silver, and thereby act as reflectors which radiate the supplied heat outwards predominantly to the thread and not as waste heat.
