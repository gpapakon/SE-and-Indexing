substance is soy bean lecithin (soy bean phosphatide)
and/or egg lecithin.
A cyclosporin(s) containing pharmaceutical preparation
for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

the used 3-sn-phosphatidyl choline is partially or completely
hydrogenated.
A cyclosporin(s) containing pharmaceutical preparation
for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

as oils of natural origin are used soy bean oil and/or
corn oil and/or fish oil and/or safflower oil and/or

wheat germ oil and/or olive oil and/or partly or completely
hydrogenated oils thereof and/or medium-chain

triglycerides (e.g. coconut oil), and that preferably
the oil is free of peroxides.
A cyclosporin(s) containing pharmaceutical preparation
for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

the concentration of the cyclosporins in the oil is between
0.2 - 10.0% by weight, preferably between 1 - 5%

by weight. 
A cyclosporin(s) containing pharmaceutical preparation
for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

the natural oil amounts to 5 - 80%, preferably 20 - 50%
of the total weight of the pharmaceutical preparation.
A cyclosporin(s) containing pharmaceutical preparation
for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

as pharmaceutically tolerable free fatty acids saturated
and/or unsaturated fatty acids and/or alkali salts

thereof are comprised, preferably having 6-26 carbon
atoms.
A cyclosporin(s) containing pharmaceutical preparation
for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

the concentration of free fatty acids and/or the alkali
salts thereof lies within the range of 0.1 to 3.0% by

weight, preferably 0.5 to 1.5% by weight.
A cyclosporin(s) containing pharmaceutical preparation
for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

the cyclosporins which are dissolved in natural oils
and/or hydrogenated and/or partly hydrogenated natural

oils are enclosed in the interior of fatty particles
consisting of said oils, and are surrounded by an envelope 

of 3-sn-phosphatidyl choline and/or phosphatidyl
ethanol amine and are being emulsified in water.

for oral application according to one or more of the

preceding claims,

characterized in that

following the oral administration of said preparation a
substantial portion of the cyclosporin is not released

in the stomach, but only in the small intestines.
A process for the production of the cyclosporin(s)
containing pharmaceutical preparation for oral application

according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterized in that

said cyclosporins are dissolved in natural oils; and
are subsequently emulsified with 3-sn-phosphatidyl choline

and/or phosphatidyl ethanol amine in a manner known
per se.
A process according to claim 14
