<ABSTRACT>
A laser beam for ultrasonic generation is emitted to a reflector/vibrator to generate an ultrasonic wave, and the ultrasonic 
wave is transmitted to an object to be inspected. The ultrasonic wave transmitted to the object is reflected at a flaw inside the object, 

returns to the reflector/vibrator and vibrates it. The vibration is detected using a laser beam for ultrasonic detection to find 
flaws inside the object. According to the present invention, ultrasonic flaw detection can be made for reflecting materials having 

corrugations on their surface or having a low reflection factor of light, and for objects made of materials which cannot easily generate 
the ultrasonic wave by the laser beam. For such materials, the conventional method has not been useful because it adopts 

the direct application of the laser beam to the surface of the object to generate the ultrasonic wave.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an inspection for 
advanced thermal reactors, fast breeders, light water reactors, 
plant equipment and other equipment in general, and 
more particularly it relates to a laser ultrasonic detection 
method and apparatus therefor which can be applied to in-service 
inspection as well as to continuous monitoring of 
specimens to be monitored under operation. According to prior art ultrasonic flaw inspection methods, 
defects such as flaws and the like is inspected by 
directly irradiating laser beams from ultrasonic generation 
laser apparatus and ultrasonic detection laser apparatus 
upon the surface of an inspection object of metal material 
or the like. In Figure 4 which shows an example of the prior art 
ultrasonic flaw detection, the system has an ultrasonic 
generation laser apparatus 1, an ultrasonic detection laser 
apparatus 2, an ultrasonic generation laser beam 3, and an 
ultrasonic detection laser beam 4. In Figure 4, reference 
numeral 5 represents an object of inspection, 6 a flaw, and  
 
7 an ultrasonic wave, respectively. In Figure 4, an ultrasonic generation laser beam 3 in a 
pulse form having a high energy of several tens mJ to 
several hundreds mJ is emitted from the ultrasonic generation 
laser apparatus 1 to irradiate and heat repeatedly the 
surface of the object 5 to be inspected so as to generate 
the ultrasonic wave 7 by causing thermal strain therein. 
Then, a continuous ultrasonic detection laser beam 4 with a 
low energy of several mJ is emitted from the ultrasonic 
detection laser apparatus 2 onto the surface of the object 5 
to detect a minute vibration appearing on the surface of the 
inspection object 5, the vibration being produced when the 
ultrasonic wave 7 generated by the ultrasonic generation 
laser beam 3 reaches the surface of the object 5 after 
reflection from a flaw 6 and the like. In the prior art laser ultrasonic flaw detection methods 
in which both the ultrasonic generation laser beam and the 
ultrasonic detection laser beam are directly irradiated on 
the surface of an inspection object, there are the following 
serious problems before the methods are put into practice, 
thus presently impeding wide application thereof. One of the problems is that in detection of ultrasonic 
signals returning from an object by the ultrasonic detection 
laser apparatus, when the object has irregularities or 
undulations on its surface as is the case with most objects, 
or when reflectivity of light is poor, the reflected laser  
 
beam from
