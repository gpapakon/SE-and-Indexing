<ABSTRACT>
A turntable having a food of solid or liquid 
put in a container is rotated during a predetermined time 

period and then the rotation of the turntable is 
suspended. After the turntable is suspended, an amplitude 

of vibration of the turntable is detected by a vibration 
sensor, and when the amplitude of vibration is a 

predetermined value or more, the food is determined to be 
liquid, on the other hand, when the amplitude of vibration 

is smaller than the predetermined value, the food is 
determined to be solid.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an automatic oven according to the preamble of claim 1.
This oven is known from EP-A-0 146 406.In a conventional automatic oven such as an
electric oven or a microwave oven, for example, a weight
of a food mounted in the oven is detected, and a heating
time of the food is decided according to the detected
weight. In another example of a conventional oven, steam
emanated from the food is detected during heating
operation, and when a predetermined amount of emanation of
the steam is detected, the heating operation is completed.
In such oven, the food is heated regardless of the state
of the food whether the food is solid or liquid. As a
result, a temperature or a finished state of the food is
influenced by the state, solid or liquid, of the food.In the apparatus in which the weight of the food
is detected and the heating time is determined in 
accordance with the weight, even after microwave heating
of the food of the same weight for the same length of
time, the temperature of the finished state of boiled rice
of a solid food is different from that of soup of a liquid
food. FIG.19 is a diagram representing a relation between
heating time and temperature of the boiled rice or the
soup. In this case, a heating object of 130 grams of the
boiled rice or 130 grams of the soup is put in each cup of
70 grams of weight, and a cup of 200 grams filled with the
boiled rice or the soup is heated in a microwave oven.
Referring to FIG.19, the heating time which is required to
heat the object to about 77°C (centigrade scale) is about
75 seconds in the case of the boiled rice as shown on a
curve R, and the time is about 120 seconds in the case of
the soup as shown on a curve MS. The soup requires as
about 1.6 times long as the heating time of the boiled
rice. The reason why the temperature rise of the soup is
lower than that of the boiled rice is generally considered
that the microwave concentrates on the surface of the soup
or is reflected thereby due to the influences of a
dielectric constant, an electric resistance, and/or an
ionic conductivity by salt in the soup. It is considered
that the such influences are small in the case of the
boiled rice, and accordingly, the microwave penetrates
into the boiled rice and a relatively large temperature
rise is realized in comparison with the soup. In general, a preferable temperature of the soup
is about 77°C, and the preferable temperature of the
boiled rice is about 90°C. Referring to FIG.19, the
heating times required to heat to the
