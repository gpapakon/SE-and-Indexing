<ABSTRACT>
A metal oxide-carrying activated carbon having an 
oxidation catalytic activity comprises a treated activated 

carbon obtained by carbonizing a carbon material, activating 
the obtained carbon with an activating gas comprising carbon 

dioxide and water vapor, said activating gas containing not 
more than 15% by volume of water vapor, and then cooling the 

activated carbon down to a temperature of not more than 
300°C under the same atmosphere; and, carried thereon, 0.1 

to 20% by weight as converted into metal of an oxide of at 
least one metal selected from the group consisting of iron, 

chrome, nickel, cobalt, manganese, zinc, copper, magnesium 
and calcium. A deodorant is obtained by adding 1 to 50 

parts by weight of a plastic powder having an average 
particle diameter of 1 to 50µm to 100 parts by weight of the 

above metal oxide-carrying activated carbon. The above 
activated carbon and deodorant exhibiting high decomposing 

functions for foul-odor gases such as methylmercaptan and 
trimethylamine and are hence usable as deodorants; they are 

also suitable as deodorants for refrigerators, since they 
have particularly high decomposing activities for these 

gases in low concentrations and at low temperatures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxidation catalytic
activated carbon carrying a metal oxide and a deodorant
utilizing the same. More specifically, the present
invention relates to a specific activated carbon obtained by
adhering an oxide of a metal selected from iron, chrome,
nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, magnesium, zinc, calcium
or combinations thereof to an activated carbon produced via
a specific process, and a deodorant utilizing the activated
carbon for foul-odor gases such as methylmercaptan and
trimethylamine.Known deodorants for foul-odor gases include adsorbents
such as activated carbons, carrier adsorbents comprising a
porous substance and, carried thereon, an alkaline or acid
substance, and catalysts comprising a ceramic carrying a
metal oxide. These materials, however, have a short life
and low deodorizing capability. Some other catalysts can be
also used as deodorants but in most cases they have low
deodorizing capability and form other toxic foul-odor
substances by side reaction. Adsorbents with or without a
chemical may be also usable, but they have a short life,
thereby requiring short-period exchange, and are not
successful in substantially removing foul-odor gases. Also known are honeycomb-like ceramics carrying a metal
oxide. However, with such ceramics, having a small specific
surface area, metal oxides can hardly be contained in a
large amount, and hence high-activity honeycombs carrying a
metal oxide have not been obtained. In addition, this type
of deodorants readily form toxic foul-odor substances by
side reaction. Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 54-78395 discloses a method for
producing activated carbon in which a carbonaceous material, to which has been
added or impregnated one or more kinds of metals or their salts, is dried and
activated by contact with steam, CO2 etc. at 600°C - 1200°C. When used as a deodorizing filter for room air cleaners
or refrigerators, the usual activated carbon containing fine
particles as granulated and carrying a metal oxide is not
suitable. This is because that the activated carbon, which
needs to be used while being packed in a column or
container, causes a high pressure loss and can hence contact
with the gas only insufficiently.Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to
provide a high-performance deodorant causing little pressure
loss and being capable of sufficiently removing foul-odor
gases such as methylmercaptan and trimethylamine even when
they are present in low concentrations and at low
temperatures.The
