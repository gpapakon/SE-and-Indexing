<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to the papermaking industry and particularly to 
an apparatus for the continuous repetition of measurements cycles comprising 
means for passing a fluid containing solid material to a screen 
to form a pad of solid material on the screen, pressure regulating means for measuring and maintaining the 
pressure difference across the pad and screen at a predetermined 
value, means for measuring the temperature and conductance of the fluid 
and means for processing the measurements taken. Papermakers have known for a long time that the paper machine is a 
dynamic changing system. It gives the illusion of being a steady state process but 
when closely examined from a water quality perspective, the water quality is 
always slowly changing. The reason for this is long times to equilibrium because 
of the high residence time recycle loops in the process. A much fundamental 
understanding exists about retention and drainage on the paper machine but 
attempts in practical application have been unsuccessful because of the changing 
system. A fundamental property which is important to retention on the paper 
machine is the state of the charge on the fiber surface, and a fundamental 
property important to drainage is specific filtration resistance, hereinafter also 
referred to as SFR.  
 A laboratory procedure for specific filtration resistance measurement (SFR) under 
dynamic conditions has been developed and published by E.C. Pires et al in 
Fluid/Particle Separation Journal, Vol. 2, No. 2 June 1989, pp. 109-114. The trend has been away from laboratory measurements and toward on-line 
continuous measurements for both drainage and electrostatic charge. Zeta potential is an electrokinetic property of particles suspended in an aqueous 
medium containing charged ionic species and is an expression of the charge 
developed on or adjacent to such particles. It has been recognized that the zeta 
potential of fibrous particles in the feed stock or furnish, used in paper making, 
has a considerable influence upon the paper produced therefrom.Zeta potential 
cannot be measured directly; however, it can be calculated from measurements of 
a related parameter known as streaming potential. A general discussion of zeta potential and its relevance to paper making is 
provided in "Electrokinetics in Paper Making - a Position Paper" by R.A. 
Stratton and J.W. Swanson in TAPPI, 64 No. 1, page 79-83 (1981). A survey of 
various methods of measuring zeta potential, including those reliant upon 
measurem
