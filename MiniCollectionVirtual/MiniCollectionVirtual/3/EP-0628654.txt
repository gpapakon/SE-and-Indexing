<ABSTRACT>
To compensate the tolerance-related difference in height between the front and the rear mounting and to prevent tilts in the rear mounting which entail noise and premature wear and which expose the rear wall (1) of the drum to rotary bending, it is proposed to design the bearing-specific surface of the bearing journal as a spherical surface and to fasten it to the rear wall (1). Moreover, the drum bottom (8) is to have at least one bearing shell (9) which closely surrounds the spherical surface (6).

Laundry drier with a laundry drum, which is rotatably mounted at least
approximately horizontally and the at least one drum base (8) of which is mounted by way

of a bearing pin (3, 5), which is fastened to the back wall (1) connected with the housing of
the laundry drier and the surface (6) of which relevant for mounting is a ball surface, and at

least one bearing shell (9) tightly embracing around the ball surface (6), characterised
thereby that the bearing shell (9) of the drum base (8) is two-part, the part (10) of which

directed towards the bearing pin (3, 5) forms a spherical annular surface annularly
enclosing the pin (3, 5) and is connected by way of annular flanges (12, 13) at both parts

(10, 11 ) with the part (11), which is directed inwardly of the drum, and at the same time
with the drum base (8), and that the ball surface (6) together with the bearing pin (3, 5) is

held by the bearing shell parts (10, 11 ) at the drum base (8).
Laundry drier according to claim 1, characterised thereby that the drum has, on the
side opposite the base (8), a bearing which also accepts axial forces from the direction of

the ball and cup bearing (3, 5, 9) of the base (8).
Laundry drier according to claim 1 or 2, characterised thereby that the connection
of the flanges (12, 13) with each other and with the drum base (8) comprises pin-like

connecting elements (rivets, screws or the like) (14).
Laundry drier according to claim 3, characterised thereby that the connecting
elements (14) fasten an annular disc (15) to the flange (12) of the part (10) directed

towards the bearing pin (3, 5), which annular disc stands in wiping contact with a contact
spring (7) connected with the bearing pin (3).
Laundry drier according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that
installed in the flange (13) of the part (11) arranged inwardly of the drum is a contact

spring (17), which has electrically conductive connection on the one hand with the drum
base (8) and on the other hand with a contact pin (20), which is restrained by means of a

spring (19) between the base of a metallic blind hole, which is coaxially arranged in the pin
(3), and a support dish (18) of the contact spring (17). 
Laundry drier according to one of the claims 1 to 4, characterised thereby that
firmly connected with the bearing pin (3, 5) is a contact pin guide (22), the spring-loaded

contact pin (23) of which has electrically conductive contact with the drum base (8) on a
circular path (21) outside the flange (12) of the part (10) directed towards the bearing pin

(3).
