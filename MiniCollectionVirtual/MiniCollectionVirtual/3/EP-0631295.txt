<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an image-forming apparatus such as a
display apparatus and, more particularly, it relates to an
image-forming apparatus comprising a spacer arranged inside the
apparatus.From EP-A-0 523 702 is known an image-forming apparatus
comprising a back plate carrying thereon plurality electronemitting
devices each comprising a pair of electrodes disposed
along a direction substantially in parallel with the carrying
surface of the back plate and an electron-emitting region
disposed between a pair of electrodes. Moreover, a face-plate is
arranged vis-à-vis the back plate and carries thereon a
fluorescent member. Finally, a plate-like anti-atmospheric-pressure
spacer is comprised. There have been known two types of electron-emitting
device; the thermoelectron type and the cold cathode type.Of these, the cold cathode type includes the field
emission type (hereinafter referred to as the FE-type), the
metal/insulation layer/metal type (hereinafter referred to as
the MIM-type) and the surface conduction type.Examples of the FE electron-emitting device are described
in W. P. Dyke & W. W. Dolan, "Field emission", Advance
in Electron Physics, 8, 89 (1956) and C. A. Spindt,
"PHYSICAL Properties of thin-film field emission cathodes
with Molybdenum cones", J. Appl. Phys., 47, 5284 (1976). MIM
devices are disclosed in papers including C. A. Mead, "The
tunnel-emission amplifier", J. Appl. Phys., 32, 646 (1961).
Surface conduction electron-emitting devices are proposed in
papers including M. I. Elinson, Radio Eng. Electron Phys., 10
(1965).A surface conduction electron-emitting device is realized
by utilizing the phenomenon that electrons are emitted 
out of a small thin film formed on a substrate when an electric
current is forced to flow in parallel with the film
surface. While Elinson proposes the use of SnO2 thin film
for a device of this type, the use of Au thin film is proposed
in G. Dittmer: "Thin Solid Films", 9, 317 (1972),
whereas the use of In2O3/SnO2 thin film and the use of carbon
thin film are discussed respectively in M. Hartwell and C. G.
Fonstad: "IEEE Trans. ED Conf.", 519 (1975) and H. Araki et
al.: "Vacuum", Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 22 (1983).Fig. 22 of the accompanying drawings schematically
illustrates a typical surface conduction electron-emitting
device proposed by M. Hartwell. In Fig. 22, reference numerals
1011 and 1013 respectively denote a substrate and an
electrically conductive film, which is normally prepared by
producing an H-shaped thin metal oxide film according to a
given
