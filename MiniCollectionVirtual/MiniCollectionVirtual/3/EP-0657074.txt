<ABSTRACT>
A ring-shaped network structure has several circles of distance areas and a subdivision into sectors whose number corresponds to the number of cells located along a circle. At the centre is arranged a base station with raised antennae for the transmission to all cells and for receiving from the individual cells. The antennae are designed as high directionality array antennae which supply at least two cells radially spaced from the antenna site inside the same sector with the same frequency.

<CLAIMS>
Mobile radio network having a number of base
stations in mutual spatial arrangement in the manner of

a cellular system, in which a ring-shaped structure
having cell rings positioned around the centre and a

central base station in the centre with antennae
installed at a raised location are provided, the antennae

being designed as strongly focusing directional antennae,
characterized by a subdivision of the ring-shaped

structure into sectors in accordance with the number of
cells within each cell ring, with different configurations,

comprising one or more frequency bands and a set
of spread codes, in adjacent sectors, and by an illumination

of all the cells, or the reception from the individual
cells respectively, by the central base station

with the antennae in such a manner that at least two
cells lying in radial direction from the antenna location

within the same sector are supplied with the same configuration
in each case.
Mobile radio network having a number of base
stations in mutual spatial arrangement in the manner of

a cellular system, in which a ring-shaped structure

central base station in the centre with antennae

installed at a raised location are provided, the antennae
being designed as strongly focusing directional antennae,

characterized by a subdivision of the ring-shaped
structure into sectors in accordance with the number of

cells within each cell ring, with different configurations,
comprising one or more frequency bands and time 

slots or polarization levels, in adjacent sectors, and by
an illumination of all the cells, or the reception from

the individual cells respectively, by the central base
station with the antennae in such a manner that at least

two cells lying in radial direction from the antenna
location within the same sector are supplied with the

same configuration in each case.
