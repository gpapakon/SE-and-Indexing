<ABSTRACT>
An assay method for biological components in which 
hydrogen peroxide generated from an enzymatic reaction is 

detected with peroxidase and a color developer capable of 
being oxidized in the presence of an amphoteric surfactant 

and a ferrocyanide. Even when the biological component to 
be detected is present in a very small amount, the 

interference of bilirubin can be eliminated in assays of 
biological components in which peroxidase generated from an 

enzymatic reaction is detected using peroxidase and a color 
developer capable of being oxidized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an assay method for
biological components which is not affected by the presence
of bilirubin. More particularly, the present invention
relates to an assay method for biological components which
is carried out by detecting, using peroxidase and a color
developer capable of being oxidized, hydrogen peroxide
generated from an enzymatic reaction, and which is free from
errors ascribed to bilirubin.Enzymatic analyses employ enzymes as analytical
reagents. They are superior to other assay methods relying
on chemical reactions with respect to specificity. In
addition, enzymatic reactions proceed under mild conditions.
Because of these features, enzymatic analyses are easily
automated, and therefore are widely used in the field of
clinical chemistry.In some cases, however, enzymatic analyses are
interfered with various kinds of impurities in biological
samples to an extent that cannot be neglected when precise
assay is needed. In such cases, the target substance is not
necessarily the only substance that is assayed.
Particularly, it is known that bilirubin in biological 
samples affects colorimetric determination in which a
suitable oxidizing enzyme is reacted with a substance to be
analyzed and hydrogen peroxide generated is contacted with a
reagent to develop color in the presence of peroxidase
("Japanese Journal of Clinical Chemistry", vol 8, No. 1,
63-72 (1980)). Therefore, in the determination of trace
components of living bodies, interference by bilirubin is
a problem which cannot be ignored.In order to avoid the effects by bilirubin, various
methods have been developed, including a bilirubin oxidase
method ("Clinical Chemistry", 30/8, 1389-1392 (1984)), an
aminopyrin method ("Clinical Chemistry", 27/11, 1941-1942
(1980)), a potassium ferrocyanide method ("Clinical
Chemistry", 26(2), 227-231 (1980)), and an albuminaminopyrin
method (Japanese Patent Publication (kokoku) No.
4-61640). Recently, a method which employs potassium
ferrocyanide and albumin in combination has also been
reported (Japanese Patent Application Laid-open (kokai) No.
60-228963).EP 0 402 094 A2 discloses a
method for avoiding influences of bilirubin and hemoglobin in measurement of a body fluid component by
an enzymatic method using an oxidizable color reagent.The process for measuring a substrate or an enzymatic activity in a body
fluid comprises acting an oxidase corresponding to an analyte to be measured on the analyte, or
acting an oxidase corresponding to a substance produced by enzymatic reaction
