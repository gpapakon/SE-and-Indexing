<CLAIMS>
Syringe for the controlled discharge of viscous materials, in particular dental 
materials, having a cartridge (2) for holding the materials, into which a rotary piston 

(4) plunges from the one end thereof, with the rotary piston being configured at 
least partly in the form of a threaded rod (4') and pressing with its plunging end 

against an inner stopper (6), and the threaded rod thereof being movably held in a 
bearing, characterized in that the bearing is divided at least once in an axial 

direction of the threaded rod (4') into bearing parts (7), wherein the bearing parts 
(7) are held by at least one expanding part (11) at a distance from one another in a 

radial direction of the threaded rod (4') and wherein the bearing parts (7), on their 
surfaces facing the threaded rod (4'), have areas (9) which can be brought by 

external pressure into engagement with the threaded rod (4') against the 
resistance of the at least one expanding part (11). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the expanding part is formed by 
at least one elastically deformable web (11). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that the expanding part 
(11) is formed on at least one of two opposite surfaces of two opposite bearing 

parts (7). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claim s1 to 3, characterized in that the expanding part 
(11) communicates with the opposite surfaces of the bearing parts (7). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that at least two 
bearing parts (7) are formed which are arranged on radially opposite sides of the 

threaded rod (4').  
 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, characterized in that the expanding part 
(11) is formed on one side of the bearing parts (7) which faces the threaded rod 

(4'). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that the expanding part 
(11) is held in grooves at its one end. 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 2 to 7, characterized in that in the axial 
direction at least two groups of expanding parts (11) are allocated to each bearing 

part (7) and are arranged in spaced apart relatonship with one another. 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the bearing parts 
(7) are movably guided in guiding means (14) in the radial direction. 
Syringe as claimed in one of claim 1 to 9, characterized in that the bearing parts 
(7) are arranged in an adapter part (1) in which the cartridge (2) and the rotary 

piston (4) are insertable in a manner that the threaded rod (4') is passed through 
the bearing parts (7). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 10, characterized in that the cartridge (2) is locked in 
the adapter part (1) against an axial movement. 
Syringe as claimed in claim 11, characterized in that the cartridge (2) is locked by 
means of a bayonet joint (17). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 12, characterized in that the one part (17) of the 
bayonet joint is arranged at the end of the cartridge (2) into which the rotary piston 

(4) plunges. 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 11 to 13, characterized in that the cartridge (2) 
can be locked in the adapter part (1) by an axial rotation of the cartridge (2) against 

a stop (17) in the rotary advance direction of the rotary piston (4). 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 10 to 14, characterized in that the cartridge (2) 
in the adapter part (1) is guided in a guiding means at its end oriented away from 

the plunging end.  
 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 10 to 15, characterized in that the adapter part 
(1), at the end on which the threaded rod (4) plunges, is closed by a ring cap (21) 

on an end surface through which the threaded rod (4') passes. 
Syringe as claimed in claim 16, characterized in that the adapter part (1) is formed 
from two shell halves (19). 
Syringe as claimed in claim 17, characterized in that two shell halves (19) are 
identical parts. 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 18, characterized in that two bearing parts 
(7) are provided which are identical parts. 
Syringe as claimed in one of claims 1 to 19, characterized in that the inner stopper 
(6) comprises a membrane surface against which the end of the rotary piston (4) is 

abutting, wherein in the a depressurized state, the membrane surface is 
prestressed against a direction of forward thrust of the rotary piston (4).
