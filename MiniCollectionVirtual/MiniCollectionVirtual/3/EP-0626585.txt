<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a programmable and fully electronic transistor measuring apparatus which carries out functional testing of transistors without them being unsoldered in low-frequency as well as high-frequency circuits, automatically and without any action from outside by means of individual transistor testing, and digitally displays the most important physical parameters after completion of the testing. The system of the search-run device unrestrictedly allows testing of any desired transistors, the SMD semiconductor components being included by means of an SMD-component test probe. By means of the integrated NC decoder, the correct contact allocation of the transistor to be tested is communicated with the measurement electronics.
