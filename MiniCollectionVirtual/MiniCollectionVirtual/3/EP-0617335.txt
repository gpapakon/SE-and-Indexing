<ABSTRACT>
In a direct recording method, the toner supplied on 
a toner carrier (1) contains at least fixing resin and 

magnetic grains, and has an apparent density of 0.5 g/cc 
or more and an angle of repose of 45° or less. The magnetic 

flux density on the toner carrying member (1) is 
0.06 T or more. A doctor blade (5) located opposite the 

toner carrying member (1) is used to restrain the thickness 
of toner layer formed on the toner carrying member 

(1) to 5 to 100 µm. When recording on a recording body 
(4), the image density is improved and fogging is eliminated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a direct recording method wherein a
recording electrode is kept in non-contact with a recording medium such as
paper, and toner images are formed by toner jumping out from a toner carrying
member directly onto the recording medium, and to a direct recording apparatus.Conventionally, an electrophotographic device has generally been
used as a device for forming an image such as documents or figures on a recording
medium. However, since in electrophotographic devices a means for
forming latent images on the surface of an image carrying member and a
means for developing the images to be formed separately are required, the
structure tends to be complex and large.A direct recording method has thus been proposed wherein a recording
electrode and a background electrode are located opposite each other on
a toner carrying member, a recording medium such as paper is transferred
between the recording and background electrodes, a voltage corresponding
to an image signal is then applied between the recording and background
electrodes to generate a static electricity force, and in response to the voltage
applied, the magnetic toner is blown off from the toner carrying member
and onto the recording medium.Configuration for various direct recording methods have been proposed.
Among them is a method of using a recording electrode with a plurality
of conductors disposed like a matrix, and simultaneously applying a voltage
to each conductor to cause magnetic toner retained on a magnet roll to
jump out from the meshes of the recording electrode using static electricity
and to selectively adhere to the surface of a recording medium (WO90/14959
and WO90/14960, the latter disclosing the features included in the first part
of each of claims 1 and 2). Since this direct recording method uses a specific
recording electrode, it can provide high quality images.In this direct recording method, when the toner jumps out from the
toner carrying member onto the recording medium, it passes through many
small holes in the matrix-like recording electrode. Therefore, there is a disadvantage
in this method that when the toner jumps out from the toner carrying
member onto the recording medium, it contacts the recording electrode
and is difficult to become smoothly attached to the recording medium,
often resulting in bleeding images or splashing toner. In addition, since the 
toner attracted on the toner carrying member cannot be stably retained, it is
difficult to cause the toner accurately to jump onto the
