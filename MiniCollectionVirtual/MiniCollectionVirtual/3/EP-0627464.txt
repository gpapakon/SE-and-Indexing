<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relate
to heat-sealable
polypropylene resin compositions containing one or more
copolymers of butene-1 and propylene and useful as heat-sealing layers for
heat-bonding polyolefins.The existence of α-olefin polymers having a
syndiotactic structure has been known for many years,
including syndiotactic polypropylene by way of example.
Syndiotactic polypropylene can be obtained by conducting
polymerization at a low temperature in the presence
a conventional catalyst composed of a vanadium compound,
ether and an organoaluminum compound. This
polypropylene however has poor syndiotacticity so that
it can hardly be considered to have the properties of a
syndiotactic polypropylene.J.A. Ewen et al. has found for the first time
that polypropylene having such good tacticity as exceeding
0.8 in terms of syndiotactic pentad fraction as 
measured by 13C-NMR can be obtained by polymerizing
propylene in the presence of a polymerization catalyst
composed of methyl aluminoxane and a transition metal
(Hf and Zr) compound having an asymmetric ligand (J.
Amer. Chem. Soc., 110, 6255-6, 1988).In the meantime, it has been found by the present
inventors that polybutene-1 having high syndiotacticity
can be obtained when butene-1 is polymerized using the
above catalyst in a high-purity form. This catalyst
has good activity per transition metal and, moreover,
the resultant polybutene-1 has high tacticity. However,
the balancing of physical properties of the
polybutene-1 is rather poor and articles molded from
the polybutene-1 have insufficient transparency.Polypropylene resins which substantially have
stereoregularity, namely, either an isotactic structure
or a syndiotactic structure have excellent stiffness
and are superior in external appearance such as transparency
and gloss. They are hence used for various applications.
For films, propylene-ethylene copolymers
are used to improve impact resistance and heat
sealability. As resins having excellent balance among
stiffness, impact resistance and heat sealability,
propylene-ethylene-butene-1 terpolymers are known by
way of example. Although these copolymers have excellent balance
among stiffness, impact resistance and heat sealability,
it is desired to improve the heat sealability
further so that the efficiency in the use of films can
be improved.Blended compositions of similar polymers were suggested in WO-A-86/02526
and EP-A-233 400. They do not refer to syndiotacticity and
its effects.An object of the present invention is to provide
a heat-sealable
