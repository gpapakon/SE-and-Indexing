<ABSTRACT>
The bead width A, the bead spacing B of the beads 
formed in the tube element, the tube element thickness H and 

the formed plate thickness T are determined to fall within 
the range of 2.0mm ≦ A ≦ 3.0mm; 3.5 ≦ B ≦ 6.3mm; 1.9mm ≦ 

H ≦ 2.7mm, and 0.25mm ≦ T ≦ 0.47mm respectively. By setting 
these ranges, it is possible to provide an ideal tube element(4) 

with which the passage resistance, heat exchanging 
efficiency, strength and the like are in the best possible 

balance. A plurality of bead rows (20) which run at a right angle 
to the direction in which the heat exchanging medium passage 

is formed are provided in the tube element (1) and the beads (20) may 
be provided in such a manner that they are located at different 

intervals in adjacent bead rows or so that the areas (21) 
where beads (20) are not provided are different among bead rows 

and these areas may form a continuum. With such a structure, 
the number of beads provided in the dead water regions is 

reduced and the passage resistance is reduced so that the 
flow of the heat exchanging medium is improved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a laminated heat
exchanger in the form of an evaporator according to the
preamble of claim 1.GB-A-2223091 discloses a heat exchanger for use as
a condenser having a multiplicity of flat tubes each
formed with baffles defining a flow path for a heat-exchange
fluid. Each tube has internal projections with
defined dimensions for width and spacing, but does not
provide U-shaped passages with first and second passage
legs on opposite sides of a junction wall.US-A-5111878 discloses an evaporator having a
plurality of U-flow tubes therein arranged side by side.
The tubes have a plurality of flow ribs indented and
joined in a predetermined pattern therein, but the
dimensions of the indentations are not defined. US-A-4800954
and US-A-5125453 also disclose evaporators with
U-flows. In view of the considerable prior art in
evaporators with U-flows it is from that art that the
present invention was developed and since condensers
normally involve different conditions of coolant pressure
and/or temperature and radiation or absorbtion of heat,
no one would have been motivated to adapt the evaporator
of US-A-5111878 in accordance with a condenser without U-flow.In a heat exchanger that is formed by laminating
fins and tube elements alternately in the relevant prior
art, beads are formed in the heat exchanging medium
passages of the tube elements to distribute the flow of
the heat exchanging medium and, at the same time, to
increase the contact area with the heat exchanging medium
as a means for improving the heat exchanging efficiency.
The applicant also uses tube elements in which a
plurality of round beads are press-formed into the formed
plates that constitute the tube elements, as disclosed
in, for example, Japanese unexamined Patent Publication 
S63-153397. The tube element products of the relevant
prior art have typically a bead diameter of 3.8mm, a
minimum bead spacing of 7.0mm, a tube element thickness
of 2.9mm and a plate thickness of 0.57mm in the formed
plates. According to an investigation conducted by the
applicant, in the evaporators manufactured by other
companies, which use either round beads or elliptical
beads, the bead diameter or the minor axis is within the
range of 3.5mm - 4.8mm, the tube element thickness is
within the range of 2.8mm - 3.4mm, and the plate
thickness of the formed plates is within the range of
0.40mm - 0.57mm. Except for the bead spacing, regarding 
which we do not have information, our tube element fits
within those ranges.It is commonly accepted
