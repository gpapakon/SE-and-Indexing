<ABSTRACT>
A device for changing the riding position in two-wheel vehicles comprising control means (20) for moving the saddle (16) and the handlebar (18) at the same time and to opposite directions according to the slope of a hill or a descent of the road so as to keep the bearing plane of the cyclist, i.e. the plane passing through the saddle and the handlebar, horizontal.

<DESCRIPTION>
Device for changing the riding position in τwo-wheel vehiclesThe present invention relates to the field of the two-wheel vehicles, in particular to bicycles. More specifically this invention concerns a device for changing the riding position as a function of the slope of the road in case both of paved roads and unpaved roads.The bicycle is a widespread means of locomotion and recreation and has been improved over the years. The innovations and improvements, however, have not modified the basic structure, i.e. a two-wheel means driven by leg muscle strength.Bicycles adapted to dirt roads and rough terrain have been recently made, while the use of variable-ratio drive systems and highly effective brakes has permitted the use of bicycles on impassable hills and prohibitive downhills as is the case with the so called "mountain bikes".Heretofore, the now possible use of the bicycle under such prohibitive conditions has evidenced a problem intrinsic in the medium that is the rigidity of its geometrical shape and its consequent sensitivity to the slope and characteristics of the road.The bicycle in fact does not offer the cyclist any particular driving difficulty both on flat and regular terrain. Under such conditions the position of the whole bicycle-cyclist is sufficiently stable; the centre of gravity of such whole is well centered with respect to the two supports, i.e. the contact points 

between wheels and ground; and the weight of the cyclist is uniformly distributed on the two wheels.The situation is different when going down a steep incline: the effect of a pronounced slope is to bring the vertical line through the centre of gravity and that through the point of contact between front wheel and ground dangerously" close together . Under such conditionsr the load resting on the back wheel is lower than that on the front wheel so that the back wheel loses its adherence to the ground; moreover in this case the effective brake is only that of the front wheel, and abrupt use of it can cause the bicycle to overturn. The cyclist tries to face this situation by stretching the arms as far as possible and moving the body back until his stomach brushes against the saddle.Conversely, in the case of a steep hill the vertical line through the centre of gravity and that through the point of contact between back wheel and ground near each other. Under such conditions, the load resting on the front wheel is lower than that on the back wheel so that poor adherence of the front wheel makes steering very hard. The strong

Claims
1. A device for changing the riding position in the two-wheel vehicles, comprising control means for changing at the same time the position of the saddle and the handlebar relative to
"
the frame in a correlated and opposite way so as to raise the saddle when the handlebar is lowered and viceversa.
2. The device as claimed in claim 1 , characterized in that said control means is an oleodynamic conduit included in the frame of the vehicle or applied to the already manufactured frame and having at one end a sleeve supporting the saddle and at the other end a second sleeve integral with the handlebar so as to cause said sleeves to slide at the same time to different directions with the same or di ferent displacements.
3. The device as claimed in claims 1 and 2, characterized in that said oleodynamic conduit is provided with a gate valve acting on said sleeves and operated by the cyclist through a manual control.
4. The device as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the sleeve supporting the saddle slides to a direction forming a positive angle with the vertical through the axis of the pedals so as to cause the saddle to raise and near the handlebar.
5. The device as claimed in claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the saddle and the handlebar are connected to 


each other by an oscillating arm pivoted at the frame and provided with a movement control device.
6. The device as claimed in claim 1 to 5. characterized in that the sleeve supporting the saddle and/or the sleeve supporting the. handlebar slide in split tubes bypassing the wheels and allowing a wider path of said sleeves.
7• The device as claimed in claim 1 to 6, characterized in that the sleeve supporting the saddle and/or the sleeve supporting the handlebar are provided with mechanical and/or pneumatic shock absorbers.
8. The device as claimed in claim 1 to 7, characterized in that the paths of the saddle and the handlebar are not the same.
9. The device as claimed in claims 1 to 8, characterized in that the sleeves supporting the saddle and the handlebar, the transmission system, and the movement control device form a kit which can be applied to already existing two-wheel vehicles.
