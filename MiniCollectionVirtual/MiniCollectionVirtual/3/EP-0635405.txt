<ABSTRACT>
A motor caravan is proposed having a fastening device for safety belts (11, 13) which is not directly connected to the chassis of the vehicle. It is composed of a vertical rod (8) which engages with its ends in the floor (1) and the roof which as usual are made of laminar composite sheets. To provide support in the event of a collision, upstream of the rod ends in the direction of travel there are inserted in the roof (2) and the floor (1) reinforcing inserts, for example wooden strips, which preferably extend transversely to the direction of travel. It is possible for a transverse crossmember (15) to be fastened to the rod to permit mounting of the other belt end.
