<ABSTRACT>
The microprocessor device is characterised in that 
it exploits guided waves to send signals between a 

control console and a series of tranmitters 
serving to identify a working state of a single 

lamp in a series of lamps. The signals identify a 
phase angle between lamp current and voltage, 

specifying a type of fault on the basis of the 
angle identified. A permanent memory associated to 

the microprocessor manages the entire process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for controlling 
and managing lamp functioning state, comprising a 
microprocessor unit and a waveguide transmission 
system. It is well known that in the field of public 
streetlighting systems, or wherever a series of 
lamps is required, remote control of the lighting 
network is required, as well as - given the vast 
areas often illuminated by such networked systems 
- a trouble-shooting system to report failure and 
location of a single lamp and give reasons (such 
as a short-circuit or loss of gas) for such 
failure. Progress in the area of modern industrial 
electronics has provided intelligent command and 
control systems able to obviate the above 
problems, but the task of adapting old existing 
networked systems to new intelligent electronic 
methods laborious and ultimately uneconomical. Nevertheless, there exist examples of such  
 
adaptations, which make use of microprocessor 
apparatus but are still not able to identify 
exactly which lamp has failed and what kind of 
failure has occurred. Also, they are not able to 
offer direct management of every single lamp in 
the network: for example, not every lamp can be 
singly lit, nor can certain lamps be turned on and 
others not. All of the above systems exploit the waveguide 
criterion, using the same electrical supply line 
both to send and to receive the signals, but are 
not sufficiently capillary and developed in terms 
of system intelligence (even where the 
microprocessor is used to its full extent) to be 
reliable, rapid and economical. To sum up, prior art disclosures exploiting the 
waveguide system, use a microprocessor so that the 
system is intelligent, able to manage a lamp 
system, but cannot identify a single faulty lamp, 
nor the nature of a fault: finally, they do not 
provide absolute system reliability for the 
individual users (the lamps themselves). A solution to the above problems has been 
proposed, in which the whole range of service 
functions relative to the remote control of a lamp  
 
system are integrated in a single multi-functional 
circuitry installed both on each lamp-post and on 
the central command and control unit managing the 
whole system. Waveguide technology was used so 
that the same means used to supply the lamps with 
current could also be exploited for the above-mentioned 
service functions. The whole system 
would therefore be controlled both centrally and 
peripherally by microprocessor circuit units. The present invention adopts the above technology 
as well as
