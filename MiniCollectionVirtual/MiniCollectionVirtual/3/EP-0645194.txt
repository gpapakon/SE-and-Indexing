<ABSTRACT>
The hand-actuated tool has a handle (12) pivotable relative to a housing (1). A push rod (2) mounted in the housing (1) is mounted such that it can be axially displaced gradually by means of the handle (12). The push rod (2) passes through cant blocks (8) between bearings (5, 6) carrying it. The cant blocks (8) are provided in pairs in symmetrical arrangement. These cant blocks (8), in the section through which the push rod (2) passes, are loaded by a spring (10) supported on the housing (1). The force exerted on the cant blocks (8) by the spring (10) is directed against the displacement direction of the push rod (2). The adjusting force exerted by the handle (12) acts on the two cant blocks (8) in each case in the outer area. At least one brake block (14) is provided to hold the push rod (2) in position. The brake blocks (14) are also provided in symmetrical arrangement relative to the axis of the push rod (2).

<CLAIMS>
A manually operated tool with a handle (12) which is pivotable with respect to a housing 
(1) and by which a push rod (2) mounted in the housing (1) is mounted so as to be axially 

displaceable in steps, and between the bearings (5, 6) supporting it the push rod (2) 
cooperates with at least two tilting blocks (8) which are loaded by a spring (10) supported 

on the housing (1), wherein the force exerted by the spring (10) upon the tilting 
blocks (8) is directed contrary to the displacement direction of the push rod (2) and the 

displacement force exertable periodically by the handle (12) engages on the outer portion 
of the tilting blocks (8) remote from the push rod (2) and at least one braking block (14) 

is provided for locking the push rod (2), wherein at least the tilting blocks (8) are provided 
in pairs in a symmetrical arrangement with respect to the axis of the push rod (2), 


characterized in that
 the tilting blocks (8) which are traversed by the push rod (2) are 
constructed as platelets or cuboids and have a portion which is provided with a bore (9) 

for the passage of the push rod (2) and in which they mutually overlap and the overlapping 
portions have a reduced thickness as compared with the remaining portion, and the 

part of the handle (12) cooperating with the tilting blocks (8) arranged symmetrically 
with respect to the push rod (2) is constructed in the manner of a fork, and the pivot axis 

(13) of the handle (12) is situated substantially parallel to the imaginary line connecting 
the engagement points of the fork arms (11) of the handle (12) on the tilting blocks (8). 
A manually operated tool according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the braking blocks 
(14) are likewise provided in a symmetrical arrangement with respect to the axis of the 

push rod (2).
