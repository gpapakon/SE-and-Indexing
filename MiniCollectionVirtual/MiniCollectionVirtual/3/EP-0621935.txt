<DESCRIPTION>
 Title: Pipe CouplingDESCRIPTIONThis invention concerns pipe couplings. If a pipe is to be cast into a concrete wall or floor, formwork for the casting has to be altered to allow the pipe to pass through. That is time consuming and hence costly. Furthermore, the altered formwork will be less re-usable. Additional expense arises in supporting the pipe temporarily during casting. Alignment of the pipe is time consuming and difficult and often a source of error.When alignment of a pipe to be cast in concrete is critical, the general practice is to make a hole in the concrete that is larger than the pipe. The pipe is then positioned later and secondary formwork used for casting concrete about the pipe. Obviously, that involves additional time, work and expense. Furthermore, the additional concrete joints may provide regions of weakness through which leakages may occur. Finally, the concrete may have an inferior surface appearance because of the two casting operations.An object of this invention is to provide a way of casting pipes into concrete that avoids or at least mitigates against one or more of the above-mentioned 

 disadvantages.According to the invention there is provided a pipe coupling, which coupling may itself be cast into concrete and to which one or more pipes may be coupled. A preferred pipe coupling of the invention comprises a sleeve having an external flange for attaching the coupling to formwork for concrete casting. The flange may be integral with or separable from the sleeve. The external flange may be spaced inwardly from one end of the sleeve, whereby a collar or the like may be connected thereto by means for drawing the collar and flange towards each other for urging a sealing ring into sealing contact with a pipe in or through the sleeve. In one preferred embodiment the sealing ring is in a recess of the collar and is compressed between the collar and an end of the sleeve. In another preferred embodiment, the sealing ring is in an annular recess of the sleeve end and is compressed therein by the collar. Alternatively, an external flange may be at the end of the sleeve for direct connection of a flanged pipe, valve or other piece of pipework to the coupling by any suitable means such as by bolts or by welding.Pipe couplings of the invention may be provided for single pipe coupling ie., for one side of a concrete wall or floor, or may be provided for coupling to opposite ends thereof. For a single coupling, the 

 sleeve preferably increases in internal diameter from its intended

 CLAIMS
1. A pipe coupling, which may itself be cast into concrete and to which one or more pipes are couplable, comprising a sleeve having an external flange for attaching the coupling to formwork for concrete casting.
2. A pipe coupling as claimed in claim 1, wherein the flange is integral with the sleeve.
3. A pipe coupling as claimed in claim 1 , wherein the flange is separable from the sleeve. 4. A pipe coupling as claimed in claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the external flange is spaced inwardly from one end of the sleeve and a collar or the like is connected thereto by means for drawing the collar and flange towards each other for urging a sealing ring into sealing contact with a pipe in or through the sleeve.
5. A pipe coupling as claimed in claim 4, wherein the sealing ring is in a recess of the collar and is compressed between the collar and the end of the sleeve. 6 * A pipe coupling as claimed in claim 4 , wherein the sealing ring is in an annular recess of the sleeve and is compressed therein by the collar.
7. A pipe coupling as claimed in claim any one of claims 1 to 7 having an external flange at the end of the sleeve for direct connection of a flanged pipe, valve or other piece of pipework to the coupling. 


 8. A pipe coupling as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein the sleeve increases in internal diameter from its intended outer end.
9. A pipe coupling as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 1 , wherein the sleeve increased in internal diameter from its ends towards its mid-region.
10. A pipe coupling as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein external flanges are tapped for receiving bolts or the like. 11. A pipe coupling as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein external flanges are provided with anchorages on their inward faces.
12. A pipe coupling as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 11 further comprising one or more external pluddle flanges.
13. A pipe coupling as claimed in any one of claims wherein the sleeve is stepped to accommodate pipes of different diameters at opposite ends of the coupling.
14. A pipe coupling substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to and as illustrated in any of the accompanying drawings.
15. A method of casting pipes into concrete comprising the steps of fixing a pipe coupling as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 14 to formwork for concrete casting, casting concrete in said formwork, removing the formwork and coupling pipes to or through 


the coupling.
