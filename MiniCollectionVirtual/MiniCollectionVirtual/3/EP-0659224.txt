A device for attachment of a rail (10) having a rail foot (20) such as a stock rail or 
track rail in the area of a points or crossing, comprising a sole plate (14) for the rail 

and a plate (12) such as a slide chair or check rail footplate disposed releasably on 
said sole plate, braced on said sole plate by a spring element means (24, 26) and 

holding down said rail foot, where said spring element means is braceable by an 
abutment (28) extending from said sole plate and forming a section of a channel and 

by two supports (30, 32; 34, 36) extending from said plate, and is guidable in recesses 
(38, 40) of said plate, and where one of the supports is disposed in the area of 

said rail foot and the other support in the area of said plate at a distance from said 
rail foot,
wherein
 
said plate (12) is braced with said sole plate (14) by means of two elongated bar 

spring elements at a distance from one another as spring element means (24, 26) and 
has on the sole plate side a recess (60) in which engages a projection (58) extending 

from said sole plate and securing the plate against uncontrolled rising. 
A device according to Claim 1,
wherein
 
the bar spring element (24, 26) having a tapered end in the side view has in the plan 

view a substantially rectangular form. 
A device according to Claim 1 or Claim 2,
wherein
 
the support (30, 34) on the rail side and extending from the plate such as a slide chair 

is the edge limit of the rail foot (20).  
 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the bar spring elements (24, 26) each pass through a channel (38, 40) forming the 

abutment (28) and open at the front side and completely or partially closed on the 
circumferential side and having an insertion opening (42, 44) tapering in the direction 

of the rail (10). 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the channel (28, 30) is continued in one of the recesses in the plate (12) that form the 

rail-side supports (30, 34) on the ground side. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the channel (28, 30) is limited by walls (28, 48, 52) extending from the sole plate 

(14) and forming a U shape in section. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the channel (28, 30) is formed by a section extending from the sole plate (76) and 

forming an L shape in section and by a web-shaped section (82, 84) extending from 
the plate (12, 72, 74). 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the plate (12) covers the abutment (28) extending from the sole plate (14) and at least 

partially encloses it. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the bar spring element (24, 26) is supported on a projection (32, 36) extending away 

from the sole plate (14) as a support facing away from the rail foot and having a  
 

recess matched to the geometry of that section of said bar spring element resting on 
the support. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the bar spring element (24, 26) is guided relative to the plate longitudinal edges in a 

channel open at the side and front face, where that end (66, 68) of the bar spring 
element (24, 26) facing away from the rail foot projects over the plate (12) at the end. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the plate is composed of two sections (72, 74) running mirror-symmetrically to the 

longitudinal axis and disposed at a distance from one another on the sole plate (76), 
where each section is secured by a projection (58) extending from said sole plate and 

inside a recess (60) of the plate on the ground side. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the projection (58) has an L-shaped geometry in section, the crosspiece of which 

faces away from the rail (10) and engages in a step-like recess of the plate (12, 72, 
74). 
A device according to Claim 12,
wherein
 
the crosspiece of the projection is flush with the upper side of the plate (12, 72, 74) 

or is set back therefrom. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the plate (12, 72, 74) is elastically supported relative to the sole plate (14, 76) at least 

in the area of the support (32, 36) facing away from the rail.  
 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
the sole plate (76) is arranged on a base such as a sleeper that is accessible via a 

recess (80) of said sole plate (76), which in turn runs between the sections (72, 74) 
of the plate. 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
a device comprising preferably mirror-symmetrical parts (71, 72) is arranged on 

longitudinal edge areas of a box-like sleeper (84), where sections of a points lock 
extend inside said box-like sleeper (84). 
A device according to at least one of the preceding Claims,
wherein
 
a drive (118) for the points lock is elastically supported in or on the box-like sleeper 

(84).
