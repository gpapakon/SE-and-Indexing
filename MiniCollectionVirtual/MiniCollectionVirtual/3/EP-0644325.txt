<ABSTRACT>
A divergent master petal for orientable nozzles of 
variable geometry intended for gas turbine engines, which is 

connected by means of articulations to the convergent master 
petal (4) and to the bar (12) which connects said master 

petal to the control mechanism. The inner surface (5c) of 
the divergent master petal (5), in contact with the flow of 

gases, is of variable shape between a substantially straight 
cross section coinciding with or close to the upstream end 

transverse edge and a curved cross section coinciding with or 
next to its downstream end transverse edge, with the 

convexity directed towards the inside of the engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to a thrust vectoring variable geometry axisymmetric exhaust 
nozzle for gas turbine engines comprising master petals for the 
divergent zone of a convergent-divergent exhaust nozzle of variable 
geometry capable of orienting the flow of gas for a gas 
turbine engine, used as means of propulsion in aviation. More specifically, in a preferred application, the 
nozzle to which the present invention relates is of the 
axisymmetric type comprising a convergent zone followed, in 
the direction of flow, by a divergent zone, both formed on a 
basis of master petals, connected to each other by 
articulations, and slave petals, also connected together by 
articulations, the convergent zone of which defines a throat 
of variable area and the divergent zone of which, also of 
variable geometry, may be actuated so as to direct the flow 
of gas and therefore the thrust in any direction on a cone 
directed around the longitudinal axis of the engine. The maneuverability of airplanes is an essential factor. 
This maneuverability, which has been obtained up to now by 
aerodynamic forces, can be substantially improved by changing 
the orientation of the flow from its normal axial direction 
of actuation.  
 The orienting of the flow of gas has been used for many 
years in rocket engines. In them, the systems are much 
simpler, since the nozzles are of constant geometry. Convergent-divergent nozzles of variable geometry are of 
relatively recent introduction in supersonic planes driven by 
turbojet or turboprop engines. In this class of nozzle the systems for the orienting of 
the flow are still not in operating stage, being in the 
experimentation or development phase. The ones which are in 
a more advanced state are those of the two-dimensional type 
in which the flow is directed only in one plane. It is of particular advantage to effect the orientation 
of the flow in nozzles with axial symmetry since the 
direction of the flow can then be varied in any axial plane, 
the pitch and yaw planes being particularly important. There are various patents covering mechanisms for 
orienting the flow in this type of nozzle, since 
theoretically it is possible to effect it in various ways, 
although it is very difficult not to have them of a high 
degree of complication. To direct only the divergent zone of the nozzle 
downstream of the A8 throat area has the advantage that the 
disturbances induced by the orientation are not transmitted 
upstream of the engine and that the sealing of the spaces 
betwee
