<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a sole of an electric steam iron. According to the invention, the sole (1) includes, furthermore, on its lower face (9), from the point (3) towards the heel (20), after the first vaporisation area (14), a first drying area (16), devoid of steam outlet orifices, and extending transversely between the lateral edges (30 and 40) of the sole (1), this said first drying area (16) being followed by a second vaporisation area (17) extending transversely between the lateral edges (30 and 40) of the sole (1) and in which the steam outlet orifices (10) emerge, the said second vaporisation area (17) itself being followed by a second drying area (18) devoid of steam outlet orifices and extending over the entire remaining rear surface of the sole.

<CLAIMS>
Electric steam iron having a sole plate (1) extending 
longitudinally from a tip (3) to a heel (20), and comprising a 

heating element (4) moulded into a protrusion and two 
vaporisation chambers (5, 6) closed by a cover (2) and 

separated by a partition (7), that is to say a first main 
vaporisation chamber (5) fed with water by means of a first 

device for injecting water through a first opening (8) formed 
in the cover (2) and communicating with steam outlet orifices 

(10) formed in the sole plate in the vicinity of the lateral 
edges (30, 40) of the said sole plate (1), and a second 

vaporisation chamber (6) positioned in the front region of the 
sole plate (1), fed with water by means of a second device for 

injecting water through a second opening (11) formed in the 
cover (2) and communicating with other steam outlet orifices 

(12) formed in the front central part of the sole plate, the 
orifices (10) formed in the vicinity of the lateral edges of 

the sole plate and the orifices (12) formed in the front 
central part of the sole plate forming on the said sole plate 

a first vaporisation area (14),
characterised in that
 the sole plate (1) also has, on its 
bottom face (9), from the tip (3) to the heel (20), after the 

first vaporisation area (14), a first drying area (16), with 
no steam outlet orifices, and extending transversely between 

the lateral edges (30 and 40) of the sole plate (1), this said 
first drying area (16) being followed by a second vaporisation 

area (17) extending transversely between the lateral edges (30 
and 40) of the sole plate (1) and in which the steam outlet 

orifices (10) open out, the said second vaporisation area (17)  
 

itself being followed by a second drying area (18) with no 
steam outlet orifices and extending over the entire remaining 

rear surface of the sole plate. 
Electric steam iron according to claim 1,
characterised in that
 the second vaporisation area (17) has 
ducts (21, 22) for conveying steam to the central part (23) of 

the sole plate (1), the said ducts (21 and 22) being adapted 
to distribute the steam issuing from the steam outlet orifices 

(10) over the whole of the said second area (17). 
Electric steam iron comprising a sole plate (1) covered 
with a non-corrodible plate (15) according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that
 the steam ducts are formed by channels 
covered by the plate (15) which for this purpose has holes 

situated opposite the steam outlet orifices. 
Electric steam iron according to claim 3,
characterised in that
 the channels have circular recesses with 
a substantially different depth. 
Electric steam iron according to claim 4,
characterised in that
 the channels having circular recesses 
are longitudinal and transverse channels. 
Electric steam iron according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
characterised in that
 the second vaporisation area provided 
with longitudinal and transverse channels has the shape of a 

chevron on which the apex of the V is turned towards the tip 
(3) of the iron.
