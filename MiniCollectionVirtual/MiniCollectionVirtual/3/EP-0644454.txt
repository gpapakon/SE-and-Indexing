<ABSTRACT>
A photographic silver halide material is disclosed which comprises a 
support and on one or both sides thereof at least one silver halide 

emulsion layer and a protective antistress layer of hydrophilic colloid 
and which comprises in an outermost layer on the side(s) containing at 

least one emulsion layer a polyoxyalkylene compound as an antistatic 
agent, characterised in that said antistress layer comprises at least 

one synthetic clay. In addition to the preservation of antistatic 
properties after processing of the said material an improvement in 

surface glare as appreciated upon examination of medical X-ray films is 
obtained. Moreover the occurrence after processing of water spot defects 

and sticking is avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is related to a light-sensitive silver halide 
photographic material having an antistatic layer. It is well-known that a photographic film coated with 
hydrophilic colloid layers at one or two sides of the undercoat, 
e.g. a polyester undercoat, has a low conductivity due to the 
electric-insulating properties and becomes electrostatically charged 
by friction with dielectric materials and/or contact with 
electrostatically chargeable transport means, e.g. rollers. The 
charging occurs particularly easily in a relatively dry atmospheric 
environment, and especially with rapidly moving mechanical transport 
systems. The electrostatical charge that is accumulated may cause 
various problems due to the fact that it cannot be discharged 
gradually. As a consequence e.g. partial exposure of the 
photosensitive silver halide emulsion layers of the photographic 
material after an abrupt discharge may occur before development. 
This partial exposure results in the formation of dot-like or 
branch-like or feather-like spots after development of the 
photographic material. In praxis the photographic material is subjected to frictional 
contact with other elements during manufacturing, e.g. during a 
coating or cutting stage, and during use, e.g. during 
image-processing. Especially in the reeling-up or unreeling of dry 
photographic film in a camera high friction may build up, resulting 
in electrostatic charges that may attract dust or cause sparking. In 
unprocessed photographic silver halide emulsion materials sparking 
causes undesirable exposure marks and degrades the image quality. These disturbing phenomena however cannot be observed prior to 
development. As this phenomenon is very irreproducible, difficulties 
arise for the quality control department to evaluate said 
photographic material. In order to reduce electrostatic charging of a photographic 
material comprising a hydrophobic resin undercoat layer or support 
and at least one hydrophilic colloid layer on at least one side of  
 
said support without impairing its transparency it is known to apply 
coatings which are formed of or incorporate ionic compounds such as 
antistatic high molecular weight watersoluble polymeric compounds 
having ionic groups at frequent intervals in the polymer chain [ref. 
e.g. Photographic Emulsion Chemistry, by G.F. Duffin, - The Focal 
Press - London (1966) - Focal Press Limited, p. 168, 
US-P 4,301,240]. Especially preferred antistatic compositions have been described 
in US-P 4,610,955. These
