<ABSTRACT>
An information signal reproducing apparatus enables the top of a 
recorded image to be located within a short time without a special 

setting operation. When a date search key and a fast-forward (FF) key 
are successively pressed, a search for a date change point is made in 

a fast-forward mode, and subsequently, cuing up for the date change 
point is executed in a review (REV) mode. When the date search key and 

a rewind (REW) key are successively pressed, a search for a date change 
point is made in a rewind mode. Subsequently, cuing up for the date 

change point is executed in a cue (CUE) mode, and further the date 

change point cuing-up operation is executed in the review mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to: apparatus having an information
signal reproducing function (hereinafter referred to as
"information signal reproducing apparatus"), e.g. a video tape
recorder (hereinafter referred to as"VTR") which is united with
a camera, i.e. a so-called video camera; and to information
signal reproducing methods. More particularly, this invention
relates to the location, in information signal reproducing
methods and apparatus, of the top of recorded information. (The
process of locating the top of recorded information will
hereinafter be referred to as "cuing up".)As a method of locating the top of a recorded image in a
video camera or a stationary VTR, there is a method in which an
index signal is recorded on a longitudinal or diagonal track of
a video tape in association with the top of a recorded image by
setting an index signal recording mode at the time of video
recording, and cuing up is executed by using the recorded index
signal.However, this method needs an operation of setting the
index signal recording mode. Therefore, when the video recording
mode and the stand-by mode are frequently repeated as in the case
of a video camera, every time the video recording mode is set by
actuating the video recording button, it is necessary to judge
whether or not recording of an index signal is required, and if 
required, the index signal recording mode must be set. Therefore, the operation is
troublesome. If the system is arranged so that the index signal recording mode will be
automatically set every time the video recording mode is set, the number of positions where
index signals are recorded undesirably increases, resulting in an increase in the time required
for the cuing-up operation.European Patent Application Publication No. EP-A-0 469 874, discloses an apparatus
according to the pre-characterising part of claim 1 hereof and a method according to the pre-characterising
part of claim 6 hereof. In this apparatus and method, the information signal
is music and, in a data music scan processing mode, a magnetic tape is reproduced for a
predetermined period of time from a point in time when it is detected by fast forward search
of the tape that calendar information recorded on the tape has changed by at least a
predetermined value.JP-A-3 025 743 discloses a UTR where a time code
is recorded in the black burst signal and searching a time code is done in a forward mode followed by a rewind mode.EP-A-0 160 102 discloses an audio recorder where
search for a time code is done in a fast forward

<CLAIMS>
An information signal reproducing apparatus for reproducing an information
signal and date data from a magnetic tape (8b) having said information signal

recorded on a predetermined portion of a diagonal track and further having said date
data recorded on a portion of said diagonal track which is different from said video

signal recording portion, said information signal reproducing apparatus comprising:

first means for setting a search mode for effecting cuing-up at a point where
said date data changes, said search mode corresponding to a first reproducing speed;

and
second means for detecting date data reproduced from said magnetic tape;

   characterised in that:

the apparatus is capable of reproducing a said information signal that is a
video signal; and
third means is provided for controlling an operation mode of said information
signal reproducing apparatus on the basis of outputs from said first and second means,

said third means effecting control such that a search operation is executed in the
search mode set by said first means, and a cuing-up operation is executed in a review

mode, said review mode corresponding to a second reproducing speed slower than
said first reproducing speed.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said second means is operative to
detect as a date data change a change from a state where date data is present to a state

where no date data is present, or a change from a state where no date data is present
to a state where date data is present.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein, when a search mark is detected in
a portion where no date data is present, said second means does not detect it as a

date data change.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said first means provides a scan
mode in which a cuing-up operation and a playback operation are alternately repeated, 

and during the scan mode executed in a backward direction said second means does
not detect a date change in a portion which has been run during said playback

operation.
Apparatus according to Claim 1, wherein said third means is operative to
effect control such that when the cuing-up operation has continued for a

predetermined time without cuing-up at a point where the date data changes, the
operation mode returns to the search operation.
An information signal reproducing method for reproducing an information
signal and date data from a magnetic tape (8b) having said information signal

recorded on a predetermined portion of a diagonal track and further having said date
data recorded on a portion of said diagonal track which is different from said video

signal recording portion, said information signal reproducing method comprising:

a first step of setting a search mode for effecting cuing-up at a point where
said date data changes, said search mode corresponding to a first reproducing speed;

and
a second step of detecting date data reproduced from said magnetic tape;

   characterised in that:

the reproduced information signal is a video signal; and
a third step of controlling an operation mode on the basis of outputs obtained
in said first and second steps is carried out, said third step including effecting control

such that a search operation is executed in the search mode set in said first step, and
a cuing-up operation is executed in a review mode, said review mode corresponding

to a second reproducing speed slower than said first reproducing speed.
A method according to Claim 6, wherein said second step includes detecting
as a date data change a change from a state where date data is present to a state

where no date data is present, or a change from a state where no date data is present
to a state where date data is present.
A method according to Claim 6, wherein, in said second step, a search mark 
which is detected in a portion where no date data is present is not detected as a date

data change.

A method according to Claim 6, wherein said third step includes effecting
control such that when the cuing-up operation has continued for a predetermined time

without cuing-up at a point where the date data changes, the operation mode returns
