<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to apparatus for cooking food and has been 
developed in association with a method for cooking food. It is known for example from EP A 2 226 350 to provide apparatus for cooking 
food where the food items to be cooked are placed upon conveyor means and 
transported through an oven which may include means for spraying heated fluids 
on to the food items to be cooked. However, the conveyor means currently used 
in the food industry, are ill suited or even unable to turn and tumble products. 
To achieve this result some current methods require the use of two separate 
conveyor belts and conveyors being placed at upper and lower levels to each 
other. The cooking apparatus of the present invention provides a significant alternative 
to this method of conveying items. The conveyor means comprised in the 
apparatus of the present invention is arranged such that items mav be placed on a 
single conveyor belt arranged with one or a series of dips, so that in use, items 
tumble over at each dip and are, in general, turned. This has a particular benefit 
to food products as it enables them to be cooked more evenly and quickly. The cooking apparatus provided according to the invention is defined in claim 1. 
Further preferred features are defined in the subsidiary claims.  
 Figure 1 is an upper perspective view of an embodiment 
of a conveyor in accordance with the present invention; Figure 1A is an exploded view of the male and female 
drive coupling which may form part of the end roller 
and drive shaft to impart drive to the conveyor. Figure 2 is a detail of a portion of the conveyor shown 
in Figure 1; Figure 3 is a side view of a portion of the conveyor 
shown in Figure 1; Figure 4 is a side view of the conveyor shown in Figure 
1;  
 Figure 5 is a side view of the conveyor shown in Figure 
1, but with the conveyor belt in a different 
arrangement; Figure 6 is a further side view of the conveyor shown 
in Figure 1, but with the conveyor belt in a further 
different arrangement; Figure 7 is a sectional side view of a cooking 
apparatus with the conveyor shown in Figure 1 in 
operative position therein; and, Figure 8 is a perspective view of the cooking apparatus 
shown in Figure 7. The following description is given by way of example 
only in embodiments of the conveyor apparatus of the 
present invention. In Figures 1 to 4, there is shown a 
conveyor 10 comprising a conveyor belt 12 positioned 
between first and second end parts 14 and 16, 
respectively, of the conveyor 10. The
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A spray cooking apparatus comprising: 

a housing (102); 
a cooking chamber (104) located within said housing (102) and having 
longitudinally spaced inlet and outlet ends (14,16); 
a conveyor means (10) to convey food to be cooked through said cooking 
chamber (104), said conveyor means (10) being substantially linear and 

longitudinally disposed between said inlet and outlet ends (14,16); 
loading means (116) to load food into said cooking chamber (104) without 
entrainment of said food in a liquid; and 
spray means (106) for delivering liquid cooking medium longitudinally 
disposed along the length of said cooking chamber (104), said spray means (106) 

spraying said food with a cooking liquid as said food passes through said cooking 
chamber (104) to cook said food; 
means to collect excess cooking liquid for reuse in cooking of food; 
 
   characterised in that said conveyor means (10) comprises a conveyor belt 

means (12) the continuous belt thereof having a portion (22) arranged to convey food items, and comprising 
at least one dip (28) such that, in use at a said dip (28), food items fall from a 

first level of the conveyor belt means (12) to a lower level of said conveyor belt 
means (12), said conveyor belt means returning to said first level after each said 

at least one dip (28). 
A spray cooking apparatus as claimed in claim 1 characterised in that a 
plurality of dips (28) are spaced along the length of said conveyor means (12). 
A spray cooking apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 or 2 
characterised in that said conveyor means (12) comprises a grid like mesh capable 

of allowing cooking liquid to pass therethrough. 
A spray cooking apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 further 
comprising a tensioning device positioned at either or both the first and second 

end parts of the conveyor.  
 
A spray cooking apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 wherein 
the conveyor includes a male 
to female drive coupling for the end roller to attach 
to a drive mechanism with gear wheels or sprockets fixed to the end roller thereby 

imparting the drive to the conveyor. 
A spray cooking apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5 wherein at 
the location of each dip (28) the conveyor belt (12) runs over an upper roller (30) 

and then over a further roller (32) located immediately below the associated upper 
roller (30), and wherein at least one lower roller (32) is adjustably mounted so 

that the tension of the belt (12) can be varied.
