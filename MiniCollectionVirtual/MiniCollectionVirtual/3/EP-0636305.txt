<ABSTRACT>
A pneumatic precision sower comprising a seed dispenser device 
(10) provided with a rotatable perforate dispenser disc (13) 

cooperating with a stripper (14) and with a driver disc (31). 
The perforations (38) of the dispenser disc (13) are partitioned 

by elements (40, 41) disposed at the rear of the disc 
(13) in a housing (12) wherethrough air is aspirated for 

retaining the seeds on the disc (13). The driver disc (31) is 
provided with circumferentially disposed pins (53) acting to 

agitate the seeds in the container (11). 
The solution permits the construction of the seed dispenser to 
be simplified and its functionality to be rationalized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to precision sower apparatus operable
to deposit individual seeds in the ground at regular intervals
along a drill line and in accordance to the preamble of
claim 1.Such a sower apparatus is known from FR-A-2 678 472. This apparatus
uses two discs which are coaxially assembled and pivotally
adjustable. Each disc is provided with a plurality of
holes coaxially arranged about the axis with arrays of holes at
different diameters.A seed distributing device is also known from GB-A-1 162 683
which uses a distributing member having radially extending
slots to retain the seeds. Apparatus of this kind are known to be employed specifically
for the cultivation of corn, sugar beets, soya beans, vegetables,
and in general of any crop requiring seeds, nude or
encapsulated, to be deposed at regular spacings. In comparison
to sowers of the universal type, precision sowers offer various
advantages: reduction or even elimination of the time
otherwise required for the thinning out of the seedlings,
simplification of the cultivation and harvest operations, and
considerable savings of seeds to be dispensed.Precision sowers are substantially divided into two categories
on the base of the dispensing system employed, namely, a
mechanic and a pneumatic system.The present invention is directed to precision sowers of
the pneumatic type, in which the extraction of the seeds from
a supply container, their separation and their individual
release are accomplished by means of a perforate disc which is
provided with one or more concentric circular rows of perforations
and is rotated in cooperation on one side with a suction
fan acting to create a vacuum through the perforations of
the disc effective to retain the seeds on the disc on their
way to the discharge sector, and on the other side with a
mechanical stripper acting to strip surplus seeds from the
disc for their return to the supply container to thereby
ensure the discharge of individual seed grains. With known precision sowers in which the perforations of the
disc are of substantially circular shape, it is difficult to
achieve the retention of only one seed grain in each perforation
of the disc, particularly when the seeds are of irregular
shape and variable dimensions. For this reason there is
a tendency to employ a disc with perforations of greater size
to thereby ensure the retention of at least one seed grain.
While the increase of the size of the perforations is effective
to ensure the retention of seed grains of bigger size, it
creates the

<CLAIMS>
A pneumatic precision sower equipped with a single-seed
dispenser comprising a disc (13) formed with circumferentially

disposed perforations (38) adjacent its outer rim, said disc (13)
being adapted to cooperate with a seed supply container (11)

on one side, and on the other with a housing (12) provided
with a cavity (24) connected to an air aspiration system for

withdrawing the seeds from said container (11) by the action
of a vacuum applied to said perforations (38), a stripper

element (14) being provided adjacent said perforations (38)
on the side of said disc (13) facing said container (11) for

the isolation of single seed grains,
characterized in that
 said disc (13) is adapted to be rotated by a
driver disc (31) and that within said housing (12) and adjacent the

surface of said disc (13) there is mounted at least one annular
element (40 41) acting to partition the passage area of said

perforations (38) of said disc (13) at least over a circumferential
distance corresponding to the range wherein the aspiration of air

through said housing (12) is effective. 
A sower according to claim 1, characterized in that
said at leastbone annular element (40, 41) is formed of a

rigid sheet material disposed substantially perpendicular to
said disc (13).
A sower according to claim 1, characterized in that
said annular element (40, 41) is made of a sheet material disposed

with its surface parallel to that of said disc (13) and
formed with perforations having dimensions substantially

smaller than those of said perforations (38) of said disc (13).
A sower according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that on its side facing said dispenser disc

(13), said driver disc (31) is provided with pins (52) projecting
through bores (54) in said dispenser disc (13) and 

acting to agitate the seeds in the lower part of said supply
container (11).
A sower according to any of the preceding claims,
characterized in that said stripper element (14) is formed of

two sheet members (55, 56) connected to one another so as to
define a space (57) therebetween into which said dispenser

disc (13) projects so as to guide said stripper element (14)
during its rotation.
