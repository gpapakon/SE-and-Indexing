<ABSTRACT>
The apparatus comprises a main magnet comprising a frame (19) with two 
magnetic elements (1) arranged thereon. The magnetic elements (1) have substantially 

parallel faces (3) that face each other so as to define a gap (5) between the magnetic 
elements. The magnetic elements (1) comprise magnetic poles of opposite polarities for 

generating a static magnetic field in the gap (5). A patient supporting means (45) is 
provided for supporting a patient (47) so that a part of the patient that is to be examined 

is located in the gap (5). In order to improve the accessibility of the patient (47) without 
increasing the width of the gap (5), a supporting member (37) is arranged so as to 

support the frame (19) in such a position that the normals (41) to the planes of the 
substantially parallel faces (3) of the magnetic elements (1) extend in a direction that 

encloses an angle between 30° and 60° with the vertical direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a magnetic resonance imaging apparatus comprising 
a main magnet comprising a frame with two magnetic elements having substantially 
parallel faces that face each other so as to define a gap between the magnetic elements, 
said magnetic elements comprising magnetic poles of opposite polarities for generating a 
static magnetic field in the gap, a supporting member for supporting said frame in a 
predetermined position relative to a substantially horizontal floor, and patient supporting 
means for supporting a patient so that a part of the patient that is to be examined is 
located in the gap. An example of an apparatus of this kind is disclosed in US-A-5 008 624. 
In this known apparatus the faces that define the gap extend in the vertical direction. 
During an examination, the patient sits on a chair with a portion of his body located 
between the faces. A major advantage of this arrangement is that the magnet structure is 
open. This allows an easy access to the patient and causes less claustrophobia than 
conventionally designed magnets. In order to enable the examination of various parts of 
the patient's body, the magnet can be rotated about an axis that is parallel to the line 
connecting the faces and the chair can be lifted and tilted so as to support the patient at 
arbitrary angles with respect to the floor. It is a disadvantage of the known apparatus 
that the gap must be wide enough to accommodate the widest part of a patient. In other 
words, the gap must be at least as wide as the shoulder width of an adult person. 
However, it is very difficult and expensive to build a magnet having, in combination, a 
wide gap and a very homogeneous magnetic field with a high magnetic field strength in 
the gap. It is an object of the invention to provide an apparatus of the kind set 
forth in which substantially every part of a patient can be examined without the gap 
being excessively wide. At the same time, the patient should be at least as accessible as 
in the known apparatus and claustrophobia should be prevented. To achieve these  
 
objects, the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that the supporting 
member is arranged so as to support the frame in such a position that the normals to the 
planes of the substantially parallel faces of the magnetic elements extend in a direction 
that encloses an angle between 30° and 60° with the vertical direction. The faces 
defining the gap are now tilted which makes it easy to move the patient or a part of the 
pat
