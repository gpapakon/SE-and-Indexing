<ABSTRACT>
A method for reheating gases in a regenerator (1) with a storage medium consisting of a loose material located in a ring-shaped spaced between two coaxial cylindrical screens (4, 5), a hot collection chamber (6), surrounded by an inner hot screen (4), for hot gases, and a cold collection chamber (8), enclosed between an outer cold screen (5) and the wall of the regenerator (1), for cold gases. The increase in head loss during the heating phase is at least 5 times greater than product p.g.H, where H is the height of the regenerator (1), p is the gas density at 20  DEG C, and g is the acceleration due to gravity, and the gas flow rate corresponds to 300 m

Method of reheating a gas in a regenerator by a
heat storage medium, consisting of loose material

placed in the form of a ring between two coaxial
cylindrical grids, a hot collecting chamber, surrounded

by the hot inner grid, for the hot gases and a cold
collecting chamber, enclosed between on the one hand,

the cold outer grid and, on the other hand, the
external wall of the regenerator chamber, for the cold

gases, in which:

a) during a phase called the heating phase, a
heating gas is made to flow from the hot collecting

chamber into the cold collecting chamber via the heat
storage medium so as to heat the latter;
b) during a phase called the cold blowing phase,
the said gas to be reheated is made to flow from the

cold collecting chamber into the hot collecting chamber
via the heat storage medium so as to reheat the gas;

   
characterized in that
