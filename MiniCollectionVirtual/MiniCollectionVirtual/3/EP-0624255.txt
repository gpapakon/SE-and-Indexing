<ABSTRACT>
A device for supervising an area (16), in particular the crossing area between railway gates, in order to detect objects occurring in the area comprises a detector (18) adapted to transmit detection signals and receive their reflection caused by objects. The detector (18) is pivotably arranged in a reciprocal manner so as to transmit the detection signals in an angular area. The detector (18) may be a laser, the light of which forms the detection signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is related to a device according to the precharacterizing
part of the enclosed claim 1.It can be established that today there are in practice no safe devices to
supervise the crossing area, for instance the area between railway
gates, at crossings between railways and roads so as to detect objects
occurring in the crossing area, such as road vehicles and persons in order
to avoid them being run into by trains.However, EP-A-0 188 757 discloses a supervising device according to
the precharacterising part of claim 1 although the prior device does not
address the specific problem of achieving an improved detection and
enhanced safety in connection with crossing areas at crossings between
railways and roads. However, the prior device comprises a detector,
which is movable in a rotating mode and a signal processing unit adapted
to process signals obtained from the detector so as to obtain a desired
effective detection area.The object of the present invention is to further develop the prior art so
as to achieve a device capable of providing efficient supervision of
crossing areas for improved safety. The device according to the invention achieves the object aimed at by
that defined in the characterising part of claim 1. It becomes possible,
by means of the solution defined, to use a relatively uncomplicated,
pivotably arranged detector, the efficient detection area of which is obtained
by processing the detection signals from the detector so that delimited
distance values in the pivoting angular area are the basis for the
assessment of the detection so that one in practice obtains an efficient
detection area corresponding to the crossing area to be supervised, but
not more. In other words one can accordingly, by design, adjustment or
programming of the signal processing unit, achieve an accurate definition
of the extent of the supervising area by causing the distance value
concerning the detection range to vary in the pivoting angular area. The
supervising area may be caused to be substantially rectangular, which
normally would be desirable when supervising crossings between railways
and roads.Specific developments of the invention are defined more closely in the
dependent claims.With reference to the enclosed drawings, a more specific description of
embodiments of the invention cited as examples will follow hereinafter.In the drawings:

<CLAIMS>
A device for supervising a crossing area (16) between railway
gates at crossings between railways and other ways for the purpose

of detecting objects present in the crossing area, said device
comprising a detector (18) adapted to transmit detection signals and

to receive their reflection caused by objects and a signal processing
unit (19) connected to the detector and adapted to process signals

obtained therefrom so as to limit the detection of objects as far as
distance is concerned in order to obtain an effective detection area


characterized
 in that the detector (18) is reciprocatingly pivotable
to transmit the detection signals over a pivot angle (v) and in that the

signal processing unit (19) is adapted to process the signals
obtained from the detector so as to limit the detection of objects in

the pivot angle as far as distance is concerned so as to make the
effective detection area correspond to the crossing area (16) to be

supervised.
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the crossing
area (16) is substantially rectangular and the pivot angle (v), in

which the detection signals are transmitted, is limited by a first
direction (R1) extending substantially parallel to one of the railway

gates and a second direction (R2) extending substantially perpendicularly
to said railway gate.
A device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 in that the
signal processing unit (19) is adapted to, on detection of objects in

the crossing area,

a) control a gate operating arrangement (20) to raise possibly occurring
gates and/or
b) control a signal arrangement (21) to indicate to an approaching
train that objects are in the crossing area and/or
c) control an automatic train stop arrangement (22) to stop approaching
trains.
A device according to any of claims 1-3, 
characterized
 in that
the detector (18) comprises a laser, the light from which forms the

detection signals.
A device according to any of claims 1-4, 
characterized
 in that
the detector (18) is arranged on a gate (17) for closing off the

crossing area.
A device according to claim 5, 
characterized
 in that the gate
comprises a compartment (25) provided in the gate in the area of a

pivotable suspension (24) of the gate, the detector (18) being
receivable in said compartment.
A device according to any of claims 1-6, 
characterized
 in that
the signal processing unit (19) is adapted or adjustable to react only

to such objects which have an area exceeding a certain value.
