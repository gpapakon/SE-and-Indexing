<ABSTRACT>
A double column cryogenic rectification 
system wherein lower pressure column (42) bottoms undergo 

additional rectification within a once-through downflow 
reflux condenser (41) by countercurrent direct contact flow 

with vapor generated by condensing higher pressure 
column shelf vapor (70) enabling the higher pressure column (40) 

to operate at a reduced pressure thus reducing feed 
compression power requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to cryogenic 
rectification, such as the cryogenic rectification of 
air employing a double column. Cryogenic rectification, such as the 
cryogenic rectification of air employing a double 
column is a well established commercial process. In 
the double column process, feed undergoes a preliminary 
separation in a higher pressure column with a further 
separation in a lower pressure column to produce 
product. A major cost for the system is the power cost 
to compress the feed to the pressure necessary for 
operation of the higher pressure column. The higher pressure column and the lower 
pressure column are thermally linked wherein higher 
pressure column top vapor or shelf vapor is used to 
reboil lower pressure column bottom liquid in a main 
condenser/reboiler. A temperature difference must be 
maintained across this main condenser/reboiler. The 
temperature at which the shelf vapor must be condensed 
determines the pressure at which the feed must be 
supplied to the higher pressure column. In the conventional double column system, 
there is employed a pool boiling thermo-syphon main 
condenser/reboiler which is packed with tubes that are 
open at both ends and are surrounded by a shell. 
Typically, the condenser/reboiler is positioned at the 
bottom of the lower pressure column and is partially 
submerged in a pool of bottom liquid. The liquid level  
 
outside the condenser/reboiler creates a pressure and 
density gradient within the tubes which forces the 
bottom liquid to flow up the tubes. While in the 
tubes, the liquid is partially vaporized by shelf vapor 
condensing on the shell side of the condenser/reboiler. 
Within the tubes, the resulting vapor and remaining 
liquid flow cocurrently upwards and a mixture of vapor 
and liquid emerges from the top of the 
condenser/reboiler. The vapor continues up the lower 
pressure column as reboil and the liquid returns to the 
pool. The liquid head at the bottom of the main 
condenser/reboiler requires that the operating pressure 
necessary in the higher pressure column be greater than 
would otherwise be the case. This greater pressure 
increases the feed compression requirements and 
consequently the operating costs of the rectification 
system. Accordingly, it is an object of this 
invention to provide a cryogenic rectification system 
which can operate at a lower pressure than comparable 
conventional cryogenic rectification systems thus 
enabling a reduction in the feed compression 
requirements and consequently the
