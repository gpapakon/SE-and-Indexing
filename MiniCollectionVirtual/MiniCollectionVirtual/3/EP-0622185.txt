Component II essentially contains an HDPE or a blend of two blend components A and B. Blend component A is essentially an HDPE. Blend component B is essentially a propylene homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene and propylene or ethylene and butylene or propylene and butylene or ethylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or propylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or a terpolymer of ethylene and propylene and butylene or ethylene and propylene and another  alpha -olefin having 5 to 10 carbon atoms or a mixture of two or more of said homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers or a blend of two or more of said homopolymers, copolymers and terpolymers.
