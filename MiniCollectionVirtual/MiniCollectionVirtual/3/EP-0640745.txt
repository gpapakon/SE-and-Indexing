<ABSTRACT>
In a method for the cooling of a thermally loaded component (1) with a plane outer wall (2), in which method, in a first cooling section (A) of the component (1) cooling air is fed through a cooling air feed (5) towards the outer wall (2) and is laterally deflected in front of the outer wall (2), and in a second cooling stage (B) is led further in a laterally connecting cooling air duct (3) for the purpose of further cooling parallel to the outer wall (2), homogenisation of the cooling is achieved in that, for reduction of the impact cooling in the first cooling section (A) the cooling air flow coming from the cooling air feed (5) is divided into a main flow and a bypass flow, the main flow is guided directly along the outer wall (2) of the component (1) to the cooling air duct (3), the bypass flow is guided to the cooling air duct (3) without any contact with the outer wall (2), and the two partial flows are brought together again at the inlet of the cooling air duct (3).

Method for cooling a thermally loaded component 
(1) with a plate-type outer wall (2), in which method 

cooling air is supplied, in a first cooling section (A) 
of the component (1), through a cooling air supply (5) 

in the direction towards the outer wall (2) and is 
deflected laterally in front of the outer wall (2) and 

in a second cooling section (B) is further guided 
parallel to the outer wall (2) in a laterally adjoining 

cooling air duct (3) for the purpose of further 
cooling, characterized in that, in order to reduce the 

impingement cooling in the first cooling section (A), 
the cooling airflow coming from the cooling air supply 

(5) is subdivided into a main flow and a by-pass flow, 
the main flow is guided directly along the outer wall 

(2) of the component (1) to the cooling air duct (3), 

the by-pass flow is guided to the cooling air duct (3) 
without contacting the outer wall (2) and both partial 

flows are recombined at the inlet to the cooling air 
duct (3). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the main flow is branched off from the incoming 

cooling air flow as an individual, coherent flow. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the main flow is additionally composed of a 

plurality of small partial flows which are distributed 
over the first cooling section and are branched off 

from the incoming cooling air flow. 
Cooling arrangement on a thermally loaded 
component (1), with a plate-type outer wall (2), with a 

cooling air supply (5), with a cooling air duct (3) 
running parallel to the outer wall (2), and with a 

partition (7) which extends, parallel to the-outer wall 
(2) and at a distance from i , from the beginning of 

the cooling air duct (3) right into the region of the 
cooling air supply (5), for implementing the method 

according to Claim 1, characterized in that  
 


(a) the partition (7) subdivides the space between the 
cooling air supply (5) and the cooling air duct 

(3) into a main duct (11) and a by-pass duct (8) 
extending parallel to the latter; 
(b) the main duct (11) being formed by the outer wall 
(2) of the component (1) and the partition (7); 

and 
(c) the by-pass duct (8) extending outside the 
partition (7). 
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the partition (7) reaches 

sufficiently far into the region of the cooling air 
supply (5) for it to form, together with the opposite 

boundary wall (4) of the cooling air supply (5), a 
supply opening (10) whose width (C) is smaller than the 

width (D) of the cooling air supply (5). 
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 5, 
characterized in that the ratio of the cooling air mass 

flows in the main duct (11) and in the by-pass duct (8) 
is exclusively set by the width (C) of the supply 

opening (10). 
Cooling arrangement according to one of Claims 
4 and 5, characterized in that a multiplicity of 

adjacent holes (9) are provided in the partition (7) 
and cooling air can flow through them into the main 

duct (11). 
Cooling arrangement according to one of 
Claims 4 to 7, characterized in that the distance 

between the partition (7) and the outer wall (2) of the 
component (1) is less than the distance between the 

outer wall (2) and the duct wall (6). 
Cooling arrangement according to one of Claims 
4 to 8, characterized in that the duct wall (6) and the 

partition (7) overlap one another. 
Cooling arrangement according to one of 
Claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the component (1) 

is a thermally loaded part of a gas turbine.  
 
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 10, 
characterized in that the gas turbine has a turbine 

part, a combustion chamber and a turbine inlet (13) 
leading from the combustion chamber to the turbine 

part, which turbine inlet (13) guides the hot 
combustion gases and is formed from an inner shell (29) 

and an outer shell (24), and in that the cooled component 
(1) is the inner shell (29) and/or the outer 

shell (24) of the turbine inlet (13). 
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that a guide plate (19 or 37) is 

provided as a duct wall for forming the cooling duct 
(23 or 36, resp.), which guide plate is supported by 

means of distance pieces (20 and 38, resp.) on the 
outer wall (22 or 35, resp.) of the outer shell (24) or 

inner shell (29). 
Cooling arrangement according to Claim 12,

inner shell (29).
