<DESCRIPTION>
Insects and acarina destroy growing and
harvested crops. In the United States alone, agronomic
crops must compete with thousands of insect and acarid
species. In particular, tobacco budworms, southern
armyworms and two-spotted spider mites are especially
devasting to crops.Tobacco budworms cause tremendous economic
losses in agronomic crops. In particular, budworms
devastate cotton crops by feeding on green bolls.
Control of budworms is complicated by their resistance
to many common insecticides, including organophosphates,
carbamates and pyrethroids. Also, budworm
larvae are difficult to control with currently available
insecticides once they reach the third instar.Two-spotted spider mites attack many plant
species, raspberry plants for example, by removing sap
from leaves. When raspberry plants are heavily infested,
canes and leaves become stunted. With a severe
infestation, fruiting canes are damaged, resulting in
reduced yield and fruit quality.In spite of the commercial insecticides and
acaricides available today, damage to crops, both
growing and harvested, caused by insects and acarina
still occurs. Accordingly, there is ongoing research 
to create new and more effective insecticides and
acaricides.
CN-A 1 074 439 discloses certain (trifluoromethyl) pyrrole compounds.EP-A 0 096 142 discloses microbiocidal sulfenyl pyrrole compounds.JP-A 61 200 984 discloses pyrrolecarbonitrile derivatives as intermediates.J. Org. Chem. (1992), 57(14), pp. 3934-3938 discloses 2-(2-furyl) pyrroles.Certain pyrrole compounds are known to
possess acaricidal, fungicidal, insecticidal and/or
antlinflammatory activity (see, e.g., United States
