<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations for
the treatment of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and
related indications comprising a highly purified, stable, non-hygroscopic,
crystalline composition of L-DOPA ethyl ester.Typically Parkinsonian patients are routinely treated with a
combination of levodopa (L-DOPA) and a DOPA decarboxylase
inhibitor such as carbidopa or benserazide. Unfortunately,
after an initial period of satisfactory, smooth and stable
clinical benefit from L-DOPA therapy lasting on the average 2-5
years, the condition of many patients deteriorates and they
develop complex dose-related as well as unpredictable response
fluctuations. The causes of the response fluctuations are
probably multiple and complex, but pharmacokinetic problems
(primarily faulty absorption of L-DOPA) may play a critical
role. There is a correlation between the clinical fluctuations
and the oscillations of L-DOPA plasma levels. Many of the
problems are a result of the unfavorable pharmacokinetic
properties of L-DOPA, i.e. very poor solubility, poor bio-availability
and short half-life in vivo.A typical problem commonly seen with these patients is the "on-off"
oscillations in which daily motor activity is dominated by
remarkable swings between off hours, when they are severely
incapacitated, rigid, unable to move, and sometimes to speak or
swallow, to on periods where they are responsive to L-DOPA and
can, more or less, perform. The current treatments
(apomorphine, lisuride) used to treat patients in the off period
are unsatisfactory. Injection of soluble esters of L-DOPA has been proposed as a
rescue therapy for patients in the off state or as a therapeutic
tool for stabilization of patients with severe motor
fluctuations following chronic L-DOPA therapy. The L-DOPA
methyl ester has been suggested as a suitable drug for treatment
of such patients (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,017,607; 4,826,875;
4,873,263; 4,663,349; 4,771,073; Juncos, et al., Neurology
37:1742 (1987); and Cooper, et al., J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 39:809
(1987)). However, a metabolic product of L-DOPA methyl ester is
methanol which has been shown to be toxic. The release of
methanol from methyl esters may not present toxic hazards under
conditions of administration of small quantities of parent drug
and/or under acute conditions. However, when daily doses could
potentially be about 1 gram/day, the theoretical exposure
increases to about 4 mg./dl., which is close to the upper
permissible limit of occupational exposure. This risk of
