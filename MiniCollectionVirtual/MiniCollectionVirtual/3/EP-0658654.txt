<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to warning strips (7) of the above type which can be securely mounted, even with an underlying surface which has not been pretreated, and in addition are resistant to abrasion. According to the invention, the strip (7), consisting of an elastically bendable material, has edge regions (7') which project on the rear side in the, as yet, unmounted state and in addition the fastening of the strips is effected by rivet-like fastening elements (13) passing through them, in such a way that the strips are deformable in the direction of their bearing surface by means of bending.
