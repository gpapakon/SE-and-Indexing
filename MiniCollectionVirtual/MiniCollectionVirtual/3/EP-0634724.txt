<ABSTRACT>
This processing system includes processors grouped together as nodes (1) joined together by links (4) as a variable number of nodes up to a maximum configuration which is divided into sub-systems (3) exhibiting a critical size relative to a throughput of messages between nodes, the nodes within a sub-system being connected together by dual serial links and the nodes of two adjacent sub-systems being connected by single serial links, the nodes preferably being grouped together as super-nodes 2 comprising two sub-systems (3).

<CLAIMS>
Shared-memory processing system having a
configuration that can evolve up to a maximum

configuration and comprising, in the maximum
configuration, a predetermined number of processors (8.111

... 8.114) grouped into sub-assemblies (3.11, 3.12) of
nodes (1.11 ... 148), each sub-assembly having a critical

size with respect to a flow rate of messages between
nodes, the system comprising interconnection means

comprising double serial links to connect together the
nodes of each sub-assembly in order to transmit said

messages and single serial links to connect the nodes of a
sub-assembly with the nodes of other sub-assemblies in

order to transmit said messages.
System according to Claim 1, in which the maximum
configuration is divided into super-nodes each comprising

two sub-assemblies.
System according to Claim 2, in which said super-nodes
are connected in pairs (2.1, 2.2; 2.3, 2.4) in which

each node of a super-node is connected to a node of
another super-node in order to form a pair of

corresponding nodes and the interconnection means comprise
double serial links to connect said pairs of corresponding

nodes.
System according to Claim 3, in which said pairs of
corresponding nodes in a pair of super-nodes correspond to

said pairs of corresponding nodes in another super-node
pair, and said interconnection means comprise single

serial links to connect each node of each of said pairs of
corresponding nodes in said super-node pair, to the two

nodes of said pair of corresponding nodes of said other 
pair of super-nodes.
System according to one of Claims 3 or 4, in which
said nodes have respective positions (1.11) in one of said

super-nodes (2.1) and corresponding positions (1.31) with
said nodes of another of said super-nodes (2.3) and said

message exchange between one node (1.11) of said one

super-node (2.1) and another node (1.33) of said other
super-node (2.3) is performed via the node (1.13) in said

super-node (2.1) that corresponds to said other node
(1.33).
System according to one of Claims 1 to 5, in which
said interconnection means comprise serial link

controllers interconnected with one another through at
least one bus in the corresponding node, the serial link

controllers providing an interface between the bus and the
serial links providing the links between nodes.
System according to one of Claims 1 to 6, in which at
least part of said nodes are connected to input/output

members through single serial links.
System according to Claim 7, in which said
input/output members are connected to one another using

respective single serial links.
System according to one of Claims 1 to 8, in which
the interconnection means corresponding to the maximum

configuration are installed in the basic configuration of
a machine.
