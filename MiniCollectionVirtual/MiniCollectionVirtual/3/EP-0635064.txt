<DESCRIPTION>
 GUSTDUCIN MATERIALS AND METHODSThis application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/868,353 filed April 9, 1992.FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates, in general, to materials and methods relevant to taste transduction. More particularly, the invention relates to a heretofore unknown taste cell specific guanine nucleotide binding protein, gustducin, and to polynucleotide sequences encoding the subunit of gustducin. The invention also relates to methods of modifying taste that involve agents which inhibit or activate the gustducin subunit, to methods for identifying such taste modifying agents and to the taste modifying agents.BACKGROUNDVertebrate taste transduction is mediated by specialized neuroepithelial cells, referred to as taste receptor cells, organized into groups of forty to one hundred cells which form taste buds. Taste buds are ovoid structures, the vast majority of which are embedded within the epithelium of the tongue. Taste transduction is initiated at the apical portion of a taste bud at the taste pore where microvilli of the taste receptor cells make contact with the outside environment. Various taste stimulants (tastants) cause either depolarization (i.e. , a reduction in membrane potential) or hyperpolarization (i.e. , an increase in membrane potential) of taste cells and regulate neurotransmitter release from the cells at chemical synapses with afferent nerve fibers. The primary gustatory sensory fibers which receive the chemical signals enter the base of each taste bud. Lateral connections between taste cells in the same bud may also modulate the signals transmitted to the afferent nerve fibers.There are four basic taste modalities typified by four distinct groups of taste stimuli: salty, sour, sweet, and bitter. Different taste modalities appear to function by different mechanisms. For example, salty taste appears to be mediated by sodium ion flux through apical sodium channels [see Heck et al. Science. 223, 403-405 (1984) and Schiffman et al. , Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA. 

80, 6136-6140 (1983)] and sour taste seems to be mediated via hydrogen ion blockade of potassium or sodium channels [seeKinnamon et al., J. Gen. Physiol.. 91, 351-371 (1988) and Kinnamon et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85, 7023- 7027 (1988)]. Of particlar interest to the background of the present invention are guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) which have been specifically implicated in the transduction of sweet and bitter tastes and may also be
