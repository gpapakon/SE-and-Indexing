<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to power plants and
pertains particularly to improved apparatus for improving
mixing of sorbents with combustion gases in circulating
fluidized bed (CFB) boiler plants to lower sulfur dioxide
levels in the flue gas.There exists in the power generating industry a need
for more efficient power plants for converting fossil fuels
to electrical power. The need is even greater for higher
efficiency plants for converting lower grades of sulfur
containing fuels, such as coal, that exist in abundance in
many regions of the world.Atmospheric pollution is of great concern throughout
the world today. One of the major causes of atmospheric
pollution is the burning of various fossil fuels for the
generation of heat and power. Many of these fuels contain
impurities, such as sulfur which reacts in the combustion
process forming compounds such as SO2 that is
particularly noxious and polluting. Systems, including
scrubbers, have been developed for removing these 
pollutants from exhaust gases of power plants. However,
these systems are very expensive and frequently not cost
effective for most power plants.Circulating fluidized bed combustors have been
developed in recent years for burning low quality fuels,
such as coals, for generating steam for powering steam
turbines. The circulating fluidized bed combustor features
a mixture of granular limestone or other sorbent materials
supported on a non-sifting grid. An upward flow of air
passes through the grid lifting and fluidizing the
material. This results in a turbulent mixture of the bed
particles having the free flowing properties of a liquid
and providing an environment for stable combustion. Fuels
introduced into the bed will burn effectively, and sulfur
dioxide released by the burning is chemically captured by
the calcined limestone. The mixture of solids which
includes ash and calcined limestone is recirculated through
the combustor until the particle size is reduced
sufficiently for elution through the cyclones.As sulfur containing fuel is burned, the sulfur
volatilizes under the high temperatures and combusts with
oxygen to form sulfur dioxide. The limestone is calcined
by the combustion temperatures, and the sulfur dioxide then
reacts with the calcium oxide and oxygen to form calcium 
sulfate. The oxygen and sulfur are contained in the gas of
the fluidized stream, and the calcium oxide is contained in
the particles. Sulfur removal depends on contact between
the sulfur dioxide molecules and the calcium oxide
particles.Recent studies
