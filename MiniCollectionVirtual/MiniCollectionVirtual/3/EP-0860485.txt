<ABSTRACT>
A liquid curable resin composition a
dialkylpolysiloxane compound with at least two urethane

bonds and/or urea bonds in the terminal groups. The
resin composition exhibits superior shelf life in a

liquid state and produces cured products having slippery
surface. It is suitable as a coating material for

optical fibers, particularly as a ribbon matrix and a
bundling material.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a liquid
curable resin composition with excellent shelf life,
and more particularly, to a liquid curable resin
composition suitable for use as a coating material for
optical fiber ribbon matrix, ribbon bundle materials
and the like.In the production of coated optical fibers, a
resin coating is provided for protection and
reinforcement immediately after spinning molten glass
fibers. A known structure of the resin coating consists
of a primary coating layer of a relatively flexible
resin which is coated on the surface of optical fibers
and a secondary coating layer of a relatively rigid
resin which is provided over the primary coating layer.
A so-called optical fiber ribbon is composed of a
plurality of these coated optical glass fibers, e.g.
four or eight optical fibers, by arranging these fibers
typically in a plane and fixing them with a binder
material to produce a ribbon structure with a
rectangular cross section. The binder material for
preparing the optical fiber ribbon from a plurality of
optical fibers is called a ribbon matrix material. A
structure composed of a plurality of these ribbons is
often referred to as a bundle. The material for binding
such a bundle of ribbons is called a bundling material.In the manufacture of optical fiber ribbons
and multiple ribbon bundles it is important that the
ribbons and/or bundles manufactured are smoothly wound 
up and the wound ribbons and/or bundles can be smoothly
drawn out at a specific rate to smoothly complete the
manufacture of optical fiber cables and/or easily use
the ribbons/bundles in succeeding steps.Conventionally, a lubricant such as silicone
oil or a powder such as talc has been applied to the
surface of the ribbon to provide a slippery surface,
whereby smooth wind-up and draw-out operations of the
optical fiber ribbons and/or bundles are ensured.Another method to provide good surface slip
characteristics is a method of adding an additive such
as silicone oil to the ribbon matrix material or the
bundling material. Although such additives improve the
surface slip characteristics of the cured product, the
use of silicone oil or other conventional additives,
however, impairs the shelf life of the composition.
specifically the addition of a large amount of
additives causes the liquid composition to separate
into two layers during storage. If the amount of such
an additive remains small so that the shelf life of the
compositions remains relatively unaffected, it is
necessary to apply a powder such as talc when
