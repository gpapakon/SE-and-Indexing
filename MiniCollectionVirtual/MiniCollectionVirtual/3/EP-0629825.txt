<ABSTRACT>
A condenser made of plates, applicable on all freezer 
installations, 

consists of a frame on which there is incorporated a battery of plates 
composed of stainless steel sheets which are welded and perimetrally arranged 

in vertical and parallel sense, on which there are arranged water carrying 
channels, this water falling on the outer surface of the plate in divergent 

directions, and being recovered through suction pumps which are attached 
to inlets incorporated in a collecting tray recycling the used water, and the 

plates having inputs and outputs connected to appropiate channels, the input 
channel, previously incorporated in the plate inlet, having a venturi 

in which the gas carried from a compressor is cooled.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to a patent of invention related 
to an evaporate condenser of plaques, applicable on the 
whole freezers installations, the obvious purpose of which is to 
adequately operate in a freezer installation, the condensation 
tubular bundle being replaced by heat-exchangers of plaques. This invention applies to the industry devoted to the manufacture 
of the whole freezers installations. As is well known, a condenser on a freezer installation is 
configured as a heat-exchanger, the evident purpose of which is 
to transfer the heat-resistant flow of a refrigerant fluid to an 
outer medium, that is to say, water, air, and so on. Consequently, it is fully essential that this apparatus will 
have a good global coefficient of heat transfer so that the passing 
of the heat flow of a refrigerant fluid to an outer medium 
can be attained under a fixed surface of the apparatus, with a 
temperature differential to be as low as possible. The fundamental functions performed inside the condenser are 
as follows, i.e: 
To cool the compressed steams from the unloading temperature 
of refrigerating compressors until attaining the condensing temperature 
of the freezing fluid.  To condensate the steams cooled at the condensation point. To eventually undercool the condensate. Consequently, a condenser can be divided into three zones, 
i.e: 
A cooling zone of overheated Steams. A condensation zone. An undercooling zone of the condensate. In each of the above-mentioned zones, that is to say, in the 
cooling zone of overheated steams, in the condensation zone or 
the undercooling zone of the condensate, the conditions of the 
heating flow transfer are, consequently, different. Likewise, the partial heat transfer coefficient (K = amount 
of heat transferred per m² of surface, per hour and per degree 
of difference between the temperature of the refrigerant fluid 
and the temperature of the outer cooling medium is, also, very 
different in each of the mentioned zones, the coefficient K of 
the first zone, i.e. the cooling of the compression overheated 
gases being lower, in any case, than that of the other zones, 
but, neverless, the heat transfer process of the refrigerant 
fluid to the condensation medium is identical in the mentioned 
three zones. Upon considering the section of the transfer surface of a condenser, 
independently of the operating zone where this consideration 
upon the section is made, the following will be clearly defined:

An evaporate condenser of plaques, applicable on the whole 
freezers installations, of those constituted starting from the 

incorporation of an indeterminate number of plaques (2), located 
in parallel and vertically, configuring heat exchange elements 

formed by two stainless steel sheets, which are welded perimetrically 
and in different points of their surface by means of wheel 

electrowelding in an inert atmosphere, characterized in that the 
plaques (2) are fitted with an inlet pipe directly connected to 

a multiperforated channel (9), fitted with a draining and control 
valve (13), having at its ends a blind closing (15), while the 

outlet mouths of the plaque (2) are connected to a second channel 
(10) having an appropiate drainer (14) and having, at its ends, a 

blind closing element (15), the piping (9) being connected to the 
overheated steam conduit from the discharge side of compressors, 

and a venturi being arranged in the conduit towards the plaques. 
Within said venturi a part of the condensate is mixed, at the condenser 

inlet, with overheated steam, reducing its temperature until 
reaching 36ºC, the overheated gas being mixed with the liquid 

coolant, passing later inside the plaques (2). 
An evaporate condenser of plaques, applicable on the whole 
freezers installations, according to claim 1, characterized in that 

the plaques (2) are incorporated and adequately arranged on a frame 
(3), which is fixed to a lower part (4) located on the upper 

zone of a liquid collecting tray (5), firmly fixed at its lower 
side on a complementary frame (6) fitted with a series of crevices 

in which angular projections (8) are inserted, the frame or structure 
(3) having supporting feet or a support (7) acting as posts, 

the frame (3) having doors acceding inside, which are fully openable. 
An evaporate condenser of plaques, applicable on the whole 
freezers installations, according to claim 1, characterized in 

 
that the plaques (2) are refrigerated by means of a water curtain

(19) and (19') carrying the cooling water to pipes (21) arranged in

multiperforated, the water passing through them and falling in a 

dimensioned way on the whole surface of channelings (20)fixed on
