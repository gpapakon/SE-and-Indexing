<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a louvred luminaire, fitted with a rod-shaped fluorescent lamp (12), in the case of which luminaire the fluorescent lamp is arranged in the centre in the upper region of a box-shaped luminaire housing of relatively large width, the light exit opening being subdivided, transversely with respect to the longitudinal axis of the lamp, essentially into three fields of approximately identical width and the transverse lamellae (11) in the central region and also the transverse lamellae (15, 16) in the two side fields running horizontally and parallel with respect to the housing ceiling of the luminaire, the transverse lamellae (15, 16) in the side fields terminating at the bottom at the same level as the transverse lamellae (11) of the central region and the transverse lamellae (15, 16) in the side fields extending at the top until closer to the lamp (12) than the transverse lamellae (11) in the central region.

Lighting fixture with a louver and a tubular fluorescent 
lamp (12), in which the fluorescent lamp is centrally 

arranged in the upper region of a box-shaped light housing 
(10) with relatively large extension of width, the light 

outlet opening being divided in the direction transversely 
of the longitudinal axis of the lamp in three fields with 

approximately the same width, namely, a central region 
which is limited by two lamellar reflectors (14) extending 

in the longitudinal direction and two lateral fields which 
each are limited towards the centre of the lighting fixture 

by one of the lamellar reflectors (14) extending in longitidunal 
direction and towards the outer side of the lighting 

fixture by a linear reflector (13) which extends with 
a curvature from the light outlet opening up to the vicinity 

of the cover of the housing of the lighting fixture, the 
central region as well as the two lateral fields being 

subdivided by a plurality of transversal lamellae (11, 15, 
16) which comprise a V-shaped cross section with an acute 

angle, are horizontally arranged in the central region and 
extend with the lower edges up to approximately the plane 

of the light outlet opening, characterised in that the transversal 
lamellae (11) in the central region and also the 

transversal lamellae (15, 16) in the two lateral fields 
extend horizontally and parallel to the cover of the housing 

of the lighting fixture, the transversal lamellae (15, 16) 
in the lateral fields terminate in the lower region at the 

same level as the transversal lamellae (11) of the central 
region, and the transversal lamellae (15, 16) in the lateral 

fields extend upwardly closer to the lamp (12) as compared 
with the transversal lamellae (11) in the central region.  

 
Lighting fixture with a louver and a tubular fluorescent 
lamp as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that the 

transversal lamellae (15, 16) in the lateral fields terminate 
in the upper region approximately at the same level as 

the longitudinal lamellae (14) and that the height of the 
transversal lamellae (11) in the central region amounts 

to about four fifths of the height of the transversal lamellae 
(15, 16) in the lateral fields. 
Lighting fixture with a louver and a tubular fluorescent 
lamp as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 

the longitudinal lamellae (14) have a V-shaped cross section 
with a concave curvature on the outside and are symmetrical 

relative to their central axis (14a). 
Lighting fixture with a louver and a tubular fluorescent 
lamp as claimed in one of claims 1 to 3, characterised 

in that the transversal lamellae (11, 15, 16) have a cross 
section which is equal to that of the longitudinal lamellae 

(14).
