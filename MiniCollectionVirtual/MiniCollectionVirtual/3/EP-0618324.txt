<CLAIMS>
A steam iron including a steam-generating chamber (2) connected 

via a water or steam feed device (8, 11) to a flexible hose (9) 
coming from an external tank (13) of large capacity, the iron being 

characterized in that it further includes a water flow control device 
(5) also connected to the steam-generating chamber (2), said flow 

control device (5) being connected to a topping-up tank (4) 
incorporated in said iron (1) and separate from said feed device. 
An iron according to claim 1, characterized in that the hose (9) 
is connected in detachable manner to said external tank (13). 
An iron according to claim 2, characterized in that the hose (9) 
is connected to the external tank (13) via a tubular quick coupling 

(14). 
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in 
that the iron has a detachable bodywork block (16) carrying the hose 

(9) which is connected to the feed device (8, 11) when the bodywork 
block (16) is attached to the iron (1). 
An iron according to claim 4, characterized in that a second 
bodywork block (16) can be substituted for the first bodywork block 

(16). 
An iron according to claim 5, characterized in that the first and 
second bodywork blocks (16, 17) each comprise an electricity power 

supply cord (18), said electricity power supply cord (18) being 
connected to an electrical circuit of the iron (1) when the first or 

second bodywork block (16, 17) is attached to the iron (1). 
An iron according to any one of claims 4 to 6, characterized in 
that each of the first and second bodywork blocks (16, 17) 

constitutes a heel portion (19) of the iron (1). 
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 7, characterized in 
that it further includes control means (21) connected via a connector  

 
(22) to the external tank (13) and adapted to control feed of the 

hose (9) by the external tank (13). 
An iron according to claim 8, characterized in that the connector 
(22) is connected in detachable manner to said external tank (13). 
An iron according to any one of claims 4 to 7, characterized in 
that the first bodywork block (16) further includes a connector (22) 

associated with the external tank (13) and connected to the control 
means (21) of the iron (1) when the first bodywork block is attached 

to the iron (1), said control means (21) being adapted to control 
feed of the hose (9) by the external tank (13). 
An iron according to any one of claims 8 to 10, characterized in 
that the hose (9), the connector (22), and electricity power supply 

cord (18) for an electrical circuit of the iron (1) are connected to 
the iron (1) from within a single link cord (24). 
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 11, characterized in 
that the external tank (13) includes an electricity power supply 

socket (25). 
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in 
that the external tank (13) is a water tank including a pump adapted 

to feed the hose (9) with water. 
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 12, characterized in 
that the external tank (13) includes heater means adapted to generate 

steam from the water contained in said external tank (13). 
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 14, characterized in 
that the control device (5) is a drip-feed system actuated by a 

control (6) disposed on the iron (1). 
An iron according to any one of claims 1 to 15, characterized in 
that the feed device is constituted by a duct (8) having a first end  

 
(10) connected to the steam-generating chamber (2) via a regulating 

needle valve (11) and a second end (12) connected to the hose (9).
