<ABSTRACT>
A closed cycle refrigerating system for cryogenic temperatures using a single stage compressor (12) with a refrigerant comprising a gas mixture. The refrigerating system includes a heat exchanger (28) having a throttling orifice (34) which is arranged to provide refrigeration, and a single stage oil lubricated compressor (12) for compressing the refrigerant. The compressor is typically of the rolling piston type. The refrigerant is a mixture of at least one cryogenic gas having a normal boiling point below 120 degrees K and at least two other gases having normal boiling point temperatures below 300 degrees K different from each other and from said one gas. There is also included means (18) for cooling the compressed refrigerant and for circulating the cooled refrigerant to the heat exchanger and its throttling orifice and then back to the compressor. The system does not require any cascaded heat exchangers or intermediate phase separators.

<DESCRIPTION>
In closed cycle refrigerating systems intended to
provide temperatures in the usual household or commercial
range, the refrigerant gas is compressed and then condensed,
the condensed fluid is throttled and evaporated to produce
the refrigerating effect, and the evaporated gas is returned
to the compressor to complete the cycle. The refrigerants
are typically Freon-type pure gases, and a simple single
stage reciprocating or rolling piston compressor is
sufficient to achieve the modest pressures and efficiencies
required.However, where the refrigerating system is intended to
provide very low temperatures in the cryogenic range, such
as between 65 degrees and 150 degrees Kelvin, the
refrigerants comprise cryogenic gases, usually having
boiling temperatures below 130 degrees K, such as Nitrogen,
which has a normal boiling temperature of 77 degrees K, or
Argon, which has a normal boiling temperature of 87 degrees
K, or Methane, which has a normal boiling temperature of 112
degrees K. These cryogenic gases have typically required
the use of very high pressure gas systems involving
specially designed multistage compressors or high pressure
oil-less compressors. Such systems are expensive to
manufacture and operate and require frequent maintenance.Various expedients have been used in closed cycle
refrigerating systems operating in the intermediate range 
between the household refrigerating temperatures and about
150 degrees K to produce refrigeration at pressures low
enough that a single stage oil-lubricated compressor
designed for higher temperatures can still be used. For
example, mixtures of primarily Freon-based refrigerants have
generally been used rather than pure Freon refrigerants to
permit lower pressures. Such mixed-gas refrigerants have
also been used with cascaded heat exchangers or with
successive stages of vapor-liquid separation in order to
permit use of a single compressor for the system. Such
expedients are well described, for example, in U.S. Patent
3,768,273, issued October 30, 1973 to Missimer.However, for temperatures in the range of 65 degrees K
to 150 degrees K, where very low boiling point cryogenic
gases such as Nitrogen, Argon or Methane are involved, the
required ratios between the low input pressures and the high
discharge pressures for refrigerators operating in a normal
ambient environment are so great that only multistage
compressors have heretofore been used. The number of
additional heat exchangers or intermediate phase separators
becomes so great as to be deemed
