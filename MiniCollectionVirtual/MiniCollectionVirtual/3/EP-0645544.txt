<ABSTRACT>
A driving and guiding system for a load (1) to be moved essentially consists of a rodless pressure-medium cylinder, the cylinder body (2) of which contains a piston (3) guided in a longitudinally displaceable manner, and of a power-transmission element (4) which is attached to the piston (3) of the pressure-medium cylinder, interacts via rollers (5) mounted on it with tracks (6) arranged in the longitudinal direction of the cylinder body (2), and is connected to the load (1) to be moved. The cylinder body (2) is held in a fixed position, for example on a vehicle or building. The cylinder body (2) and the tracks (6) are formed together by a one-piece profile. This profile contains the rollers (5), which are provided in pairs in each case, are divided functionally into bearing rollers (5a) and supporting rollers (5b), and are made of non-metallic material at least in the area of their running surface. The bearing rollers (5a) and the supporting rollers (5b) are arranged under the cylinder body (2), the axis of rotation of these rollers (5a, 5b) and the direction of action of the load (1) being at an angle of 90 DEG  to one another.

A driving and guiding system for a load (1) to be moved, comprising a pressure-medium
cylinder which has no piston rods and the body (2) of which contains a piston (3) guided

in a longitudinally displaceable manner, and a power-transmission member (4) which is
attached to the piston (3) of the pressure-medium cylinder and which cooperates - by

way of rotational members (5) mounted respectively in pairs on the said power-transmission
member (4) in each case and situated inside the boundary outline of the cylinder

body (2) and performing separately a carrying function on the one hand and a supporting
function on the other - with running paths (6) arranged in the longitudinal direction of

the cylinder body (2) and is connected to the load (1) to be moved, wherein the cylinder
body (2) is held stationary, for example on a vehicle or building, 
characterized in that
the rotational members (5) are designed in the form of carrying wheels (5a) and as
supporting wheels (5b) and consist of non-metallic material at least in the region of

their running face, wherein the said carrying wheels (5a) and supporting wheels (5b)
cooperate directly with those running paths (6) which are formed by a section which

is integral with the cylinder body (2),
the cylinder body (2) has a structural height which is greater than the structural width
thereof in such a way that the carrying wheels (5a) and the supporting wheels (5b)

are arranged vertically completely below the piston (3), and
the carrying wheels (5a) and the supporting wheels (5b) are mounted on a common
horizontal shaft of the power-transmission member (4), wherein a carrying arm (4a)

of the power-transmission member (4) engages on the said shaft centrally between
the carrying wheels (5a).
A driving and guiding system according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the cylinder
body (2) has a sealed longitudinal slot (2a) situated in the interior of the one-piece section

parallel to the running paths (6).
A driving and guiding system according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the power
transmission between the carrying wheels (5a) or the supporting wheels (5b) and the running

paths (6) on the one hand and between the section and the stationary retaining
means (7) thereof on the other hand takes place in common operative planes so that no

moments occur which would alter the width of the sealed longitudinal slot (2a). 
A driving and guiding system according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

the carrying wheels (5a) and the supporting wheels (5b) are mounted in each case on the
ends of the power-transmission member (4) in order to achieve as large as possible a

carrying and supporting base.
A driving and guiding system according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the carrying
wheels (5a) and supporting wheels (5b) mounted on the ends of the power-transmission

member (4) are arranged symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal centre thereof.
A driving and guiding system according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that

the supporting wheels (5b) are connected to the power-transmission member (4) so as to
be adjustable in the direction of their running path (6).
A driving and guiding system according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that

the running paths (6) and the carrying wheels (5a) as well as the supporting wheels (5b)
are formed in their cross-section in such a way that the wheels (5a, 5b) are in linear contact

with the running paths (6) on both sides.
A driving and guiding system according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
characterized in that

the rolling path of the power-transmission member (4) is defined inside the section by
adjustable stops (8) which cooperate with sound-proofing resilient blocks (8a).
A driving and guiding system according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that

one respective reversing roller (9) for a belt or rope (10) attached to the power-transmission
member (4) is mounted on the two longitudinal ends of the section in each case.
A driving and guiding system according to Claim 9, 
characterized in that
 a second
power-transmission member (4') for a further load (1') to be moved, in particular in the

opposite direction, is attached to the belt or rope (10), wherein the said second power-transmission
