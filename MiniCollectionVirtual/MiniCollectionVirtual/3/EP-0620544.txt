<ABSTRACT>
An automatic player piano is implemented with an 
automatic player unit and a mechanical piano (21) having 

a keyboard (31) mounted on a key bed (32), and the 
automatic player unit has a controller (37) operative to 

memorizing pieces of a key touch information respectively 
representative of grades of intensity assigned to the 

sounds in the recording mode of operation and retrieve 
the pieces of the key touch information in the playback 

mode of operation, a plurality of actuators (30a) 
provided in the association with the keyboard and 

responsive to the pieces of the key touch information for 
causing the keys to move, and a sensor unit (29) 

operative to detect key motions of the keys for producing 
the pieces of the key touch information in the recording 

mode of operation, wherein the sensor unit is provided 
between the keyboard and the key bed because the space 

therebetween is largely equal regardless of the model of 
the mechanical piano.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an automatic player piano
(piano-like keyboard instrument)
according to the introductory part of claim 1.In general, an automatic player piano is shifted between
a recording mode of operation and a playback mode of
operation. In the recording mode of operation, the keys
are successively depressed by the fingers of a human
player for specifying notes, and the pedals may be
occasionally operated by the feet for prolonging the
sounds, lessening the volumes or substaining the notes.
Since a lot of sensors are provided in association with
the keys and the pedals, those key movements and pedal
operations are detected to form pieces of the musical
information which are memorized in a suitable storage.
After formation of the pieces of the musical information,
the automatic player piano is capable of shifting into
the playback mode of operation. In the playback mode of
operation, the pieces of the musical information are
retrieved in succession from the storage for driving the
keys and the pedals, if necessary, thereby allowing the
automatic player piano to perform the music without the
human player. In an actual performance, each tone is loud or soft
according to the strength of the key touch for an
expressiveness, and, for this reason, the automatic
player piano is provided with touch sensor for detecting
the hammer velocities used for an estimation of the key
touch.In the US-4,593,592 are described a method and an
apparatus for altering the solenoid drive during playback
in a reproduction piano to prevent double hammer strikes.
The movement of the keys is sensed by sense coils and a
microprocessor is shown which evaluates the key velocity
drive value.The WO 80/02886 describes a player piano recording system
with photosensor flags secured to the undersides of the
piano keys. The movement of them is detected by
photosensors whereby only the key velocity averaged over a certain range of depression is measured to produce key velocity signals which are
supplied to a microprocessor for deriving expression
signals for recording on magnetic type.Fig. 1 shows a typical example of a known automatic
player piano provided with the touch sensors. In Fig. 1,
reference numeral 1 designates a mechanical piano of the
upright type which largely comprises a keyboard provided
with a plurality of typically 88 keys 2, a key action
mechanisms 3 provided in association with the keys for
transmissions of the key motions, a plurality of hammer
assemblies 4 respectively driven for rotations by the key
action

<CLAIMS>
A piano-like keyboard instrument comprising:

a) a mechanical piano (21) having

a-1) a keyboard (31) mounted on a key bed (32) and
provided with a plurality of keys (26) respectively

depressed with forces by a player,
a-2) a key action mechanism (23) coupled to said
keyboard for transmitting the forces exerted on said

keys,
a-3) a hammer mechanism provided with a plurality of
hammer assemblies (27), said hammer assemblies being

coupled to said key action mechanism and driven for
rotations with the forces transmitted by said key action

mechanism, and
a-4) a plurality of strings (28) respectively struck
with said hammer assemblies for producing sounds; and
b) an electronic data processing and producing system
(22) operative to detect a key touch given by said player

to each of said plurality of keys, and
c) a plurality of key sensor units (29; 61)
respectively associated with said plurality of keys, each

of said plurality of key sensor units having a plurality
of photo couplers (64; 65; 72, 73, 74; 101; 102) for

determining a locus (A to J) of the associated key
variable in dependence on the key touch,
characterized
 in that

said plurality of key sensor units continuously monitor
the associated keys for producing pieces of positional

information representative of current key positions of
said associated keys, respectively, and
said electronic data processing and producing system
calculates velocites of said plurality of keys on the

basis of said pieces of positional information so as to
estimate final velocites of said plurality of hammer

assemblies proportional to intensities of impact against
said plurality of strings,
said electronic data processing and producing system
further produces a signal corresponding to a note assigned to the

associated key depressed by said player and the estimated
intensity.
Keyboard instrument according to claim 1, in
which each of said keys are accompained with a plate (36;

63; 71; 100) projecting from the lower surface of said
key, whereby said plate is downwardly moved with said key
