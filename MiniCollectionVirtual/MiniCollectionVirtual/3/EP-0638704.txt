<ABSTRACT>
A device for preventing from insect penetration through 
a window with swinging or pivoted window leaf (2) comprises 

insect net being arranged in a peripheral frame (6) which is 
disposed before a window frame (1) and fastened to an outer 

lamella member of a group (8) of lamella members surrounding 
a periphery of the window frame (1). Said group (8) of the 

tipping lamella members comprises an outer covering lamella 
(12), at least one distance lamella (11) and a fastening 

lamella (9) which are made as rectangular frames from planar 
lamellic strips and which are attached on two corners thereof 

to pivots (10), wherein fan-like spreading of the lamella 
members is restricted by folded seams (13) formed on edges of 

the lamella strips.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for preventing
from insect penetration through a window with swinging or
pivoted window leaf, comprising insect net being arranged in
a peripheral frame disposed before a window frame.Windows with pivoted window leaves having vertical axes
of rotation are protected against insect invasion by insect
nets which are fastened in a rigid frame being fastened
stationary or releasably in the window frames. Said most current
solution is not applicable on windows having swinging
window leaves, which one half swings outwards from the window
opening about horizontal or vertical axis. For this case,
a two-part insect net has been proposed, which one part is
fastened to an outer surface of the window frame on three
sides of a periphery thereof and against one half of the
inwards opened window leaf and a fourth side of the net
periphery is fastened by means of fastening bands to a window
pane of the window leaf. Fastening of the second part of the
insect net on the other half of the window against a second
half of the outwards opened window leaf is solved similarly
in said second part of the insect net which is provided with
cut-outs through which control closing fittings of the window
leaf may pass during opening movement of the window leaf.The insect net is fastened to the window frame in said
known solution by clamp bars which are secured thereon and
which are provided with a cylindrical grooves and the insect
net edges are inserted and secured in said cylindrical grooves
by cylindrical sticks forced therein. The net is fastened
to the window frame in substance definitely and cleaning of 
the window leaf is allied with necessity of time consumpting
releasing of the fastening means and removing the insect net.
By said solution, is not possible to attain perfect sealing
of contact areas between the insect net and the window pane
or the window frame in an area of swinging hinges and particularly
in areas of cut-out for the closing fittings.Known dust, noise and/or insect protection screen for
windows and doors (DE-OS 34 31 286) comprises flat band material
having laminated structure with outer layers made of
textile or fiber materials and being provided with longitudinal
and parallel channels for reinforcing rods. Said band
material is in the closed position of the window folded,
wherein said reinforcing rod are tilting axes. Folding areas
of the band material are repeatedly bended during window
opening and closing and durability of the band material of
the screen is not

<CLAIMS>
Device for preventing from insect penetration through
a window with swinging or pivoted window leaf, comprising

insect net being arranged in a peripheral frame disposed
before a window frame, 
characterized in that
 the peripheral
frame (6) with the insect net is fastened to an outer lamella

member of a group (8) of separate and fanning out lamella
members having rectangular or U shape and surrounding the window frame (1)

around periphery thereof and being swingable about pivots
(10) which are disposed on one side of the window frame (1).
Device as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that

the outer lamella member of the group (8) of said lamella
members is a three-dimensional covering lamella (12) made of

lamellic strips which are connected with one another on ends
thereof into a rectangular or U shape frame and are oriented by their

planes perpendicularly to a frame plane, wherein said covering
lamella (12) is attached on one side thereof to the

pivots (10) which are attached to edge parts of at least one
other three-dimensional lamella (11) being disposed inside

the covering lamella (12) and outside a fastening inner
lamella (9) which is fastened to an outer side of the window

frame (1).
Device as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in that

the covering lamella (12) is provided on its edge diverted
from the peripheral frame (6) with a folded seam (13) which

is directed to an adjacent distance lamella (11) provided
with an outer folded seam (13) on an one edge thereof and

with an inner folded seam (13) on opposite edge thereof,
wherein the fastening lamella (9) is provided with an outer

folded seam (13) on a lamella edge abutting to the peripheral
frame (6) and all folded seams (13) of the adjacent lamella

members are arranged for clinching one to another. 
Device as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in
that
 the covering lamella (12) is provided on one side thereof
with at least one hole (14) which is positioned against

a hole in the cross-bar of the window frame (1) and a connecting
pin (15) is slidably seated in said hole (14).
Device as claimed in at least one of claims 1 to 3,

characterized in that
 the peripheral frame (6) for the insect
net has at least three hollow side cross bars and a longitudinal

cavities of said cross bars communicate with a space
bounded by said peripheral frame (6) through slots and the

roller net (3) is guided in said slots and is rolled on
a winding rod (4) on one side of the peripheral frame (6),

wherein said winding rod (4) is mounted in a box cover (5).
