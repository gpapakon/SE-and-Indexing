<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel 
derivatives of an antibiotic erythromycin, and more 
particularly relates to novel 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
A derivatives, pharmaceutically acceptable 
acid addition salts thereof and intermediates for the 
preparation thereof. Erythromycins are antibiotics clinically 
widely used as agents for treating infectious diseases 
caused by Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative 
bacteria, mycoplasmas, etc. Many erythromycin 
derivatives have been prepared for the improvement of 
biological and/or pharmaceutical properties of 
erythromycins. Certain ketone forms at the 3-position 
of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide A have been described in 
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, vol. 6, No. 4, 
page 479 (1974) and Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 
17, No. 9, page 953 (1974), but generally they have 
extremely weak antibacterial activity. An object of the 
present invention is to provide novel antibiotics having 
a strong antibacterial activity.  
 EP-A-0 248 279 discloses semisynthetic antibiotics made from 
erythromycin. In particular, this reference relates to erythromycin 
A 11.12-cyclic carbamate compounds and pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts and esters thereof.  
 As a result of various researches on the 
antibacterial activity of 3-ketone forms of 5-O-desosaminylerythronolide 
A derivatives, the present 
inventors have found that tricyclic carbamates 
substituted by a methoxy group at the 6-position have a 
strong antibacterial activity, and the present invention 
has been accomplished. The present invention relates to 5-O 
desosaminylerythronolide A derivatives represented by the 
formula: 
 
[wherein -A is a group of -N(R3)- (wherein R3 is a 
hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 - 3 carbon 
atoms) or a group represented by -N=, and R1 and R2 are 
each a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 - 3 
carbon atoms], and a pharmaceutically acceptable acid 
addition salt thereof,  
 In the present invention, the alkyl group 
having 1-3 carbon atoms is one which is a straight or 
branched chain. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid 
addition salt means, for example, acetate, propionate, 
butyrate, formate, trifluoroacetate, maleate, tartrate, 
citrate, stearate, succinate, ethylsuccinate, 
lactobionate, gluconate, glucoheptonate, benzoate, 
methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, 
benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, 
laurylsulfate, malate, aspartate, glutaminate, adipate, 
cysteine salt, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, 
sul
