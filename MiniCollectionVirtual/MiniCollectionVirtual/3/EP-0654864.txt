<ABSTRACT>
An electrical installation equipment (1) of modular construction, for example a plug socket, switch or pushbutton (momentary-contact switch), parts for additional functions being designed as plug-in modules (3) which can be plugged on or plugged in. It is intended that electrical contact can be made with the plug-in modules (3) for additional functions by making sprung contact (sprung contacts (4), sprung pin receptacle (23)) with live parts which are present anyway.

<CLAIMS>
Electrotechnical installation apparatus (1) in 
modular construction, for example a socket outlet, 

switch or push-button, on which installation apparatus 
are constructed, in a manner such that they can be 

attached or plugged in, parts for additional functions 
as plug-in type modules (3), characterised in that the 

plug-in type modules (3) for additional functions are 
electrically contactable by means of spring-loaded 

contacting (spring-loaded contacts (4), spring-mounted 
pin receivers (23)) at current-carrying parts which are 

present anyway. 
Installation apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that in the case of a socket outlet 

for the spring-loaded contacting in the form of spring-loaded 
contacts (4), an access space to insertable plug 

pins (5) of a plug (6) is constructed. 
Installation apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that in the case of an installation 

apparatus having screwless terminals (8), the spring-loaded 
contacting is constructed as spring-mounted 

contacts (4), with the contacts (4) working against the 
screwless terminal (8) at a point on the metal housing 

(9) of the latter, or on an electrically conductive 
metal portion. 
Installation apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the spring-loaded contacts (4) 

are formed as helical screws (7) consisting of 
electrically conductive material, for example spring 

bronze. 
Installation apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the spring-loaded contacts (4) 

are constructed as pin-like bodies (11) which are 
cushioned against a portion of the module (3) by means 

of a spring (12). 
Installation apparatus according to claim 5,  
 

characterised in that at least one screwless terminal 
(8) has in its metal housing (9), or in an electrically 

conductive metal portion of an assembly which contains 
the screwless terminal, a recess (16) in which can 

engage, in a manner such that it rides up, a conical 
pin-like body (17) as a spring-loaded contact (4). 
Installation apparatus according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the spring-loaded contacts (4) 

are each constructed as a spring (19), which is pin-like 
in profile and spreads out against the metal 

housing of the screwless terminal. 
Installation apparatus according to claim 7, 
characterised in that the spring-loaded contacts (4) 

are each constructed in the form of a sleeve sector as 
a spring (19) which is in principle pin-like, with the 

backs and edges of the spring spreading out in a slit 
of the metal housing of the screwless terminal. 
Installation apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the spring-loaded contacting is 

formed by means of a rigid pin-like body (22) in a 
spring-mounted pin receiver (23). 
Installation apparatus according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the spring-mounted pin receiver 

(23) is formed by a cross cut in a contact spring (14).
