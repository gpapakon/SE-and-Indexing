Reciprocating pump of a fuel injection device, having an 
exciting coil (9) and an armature (10) which is the moving 

component of the delivery element of the reciprocating pump 
(1), provision being made for an initial part-stroke of the 

delivery element (15) during which the displacement of the 
fuel does not result in a pressure build-up, and this part-stroke 

of the delivery element, serving for energy storage, 
being abruptly interrupted by a stopping element (6) situated 

in a pressure line (2) arranged between the delivery element 
(15) and an injection nozzle (3), and an abrupt pressure 

build-up being produced in the fuel so that a displacement of 
the fuel towards the injection nozzle (3) is effected, and for 

the metering of a differentiable fuel quantity a circuit for 
triggering the exciting coil being used, the exciting coil (9, 

600) being connected to a power transistor (601) as current 
switch, which is earthed via a measuring resistor (602) as 

current meter, and the output of a comparator (603) being 
applied to the control input of the transistor (601), for 

example to the transistor base, and a current set point, 
obtained for example by means of a microcomputer, being 

applied to the non-inverting input of the comparator (603), 
and the inverting input of the comparator (603) being 

connected on the side of the measuring resistor (602) 
connected to the transistor (601), and with the circuit a 

clocked power source being effected and a set point for 
differentiable fuel quantities, preset in duration and level 

by a microcomputer, being preset.
