<ABSTRACT>
A tube switch for a double-cylinder sludge pump is provided including a swing pipe (202), a wearing ring (204) and an elastic member (206). The swing pipe (202) is adapted to swivel in front of a center plate (5) and includes an extension portion (212) having an inner surface (214). The wearing ring (204) is supported between the end of the swing pipe (202) and the center plate (5) and is axially movable relative to the swing pipe (202). The wearing ring (204) has a recess (208) formed at one end thereof, defined by a sloped boundary surface. The swing pipe (202) is adapted to receive the end of the wearing ring (204) including the recess (208) therein. The recess (208) thus defines an annular space (228) between the swing pipe (202) and the wearing ring (204) with the inner surface (214) of the extension portion (212) of the swing pipe (202) facing the annular space (228). The elastic member (206) includes a radial inner surface (236) and a sloped front end suface (232) that corresponds to and abuts the boundary surface (222) of the wearing ring (204). The elastic member (206) is supported between the swing pipe (202) and the wearing ring (204) within the annular space (228). The inner surface (214) of the extension portion (212) of the swing pipe (202) is ridgeless such that generally no portion of the swing pipe (202) contacts the radial inner portion (236) of the elastic member (206).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tube switch for a double-cylinder 
thick matter pump including a swing pipe adapted to 
swivel in front of a center-rest plate on the cylinder 
inside of the tube switch. A wearing ring is mounted so that 
it is axially movable on the center-rest plate end of the 
swing pipe and is adapted to be pressed against the center-rest 
plate with the aid of the hydrostatic internal pressure 
in the swing pipe. A rubber elastic ring is mounted between 
the swing pipe and the wearing ring. The swing pipe includes an axial guide surface at the end 
thereof adjacent to the wearing ring. The guide surface is 
supported on a cylindrical centering surface of the wearing 
ring, which points radially to the outside. Together with 
the centering surface, the axial guide surface defines a 
sealing gap. The wearing ring includes an outer frontal 
contact surface which abuts the center-rest plate. With its 
rear portion the wearing ring includes a recess forming a 
boundary surface separated from the end face of the swing 
pipe by an axial clearance space open toward the inside of 
the pipe, which is bridged by the rubber elastic ring. Tube switches of the type carrying an automatic, 
hydrostatically adjusting wearing ring, typically referred 
to as an automatic ring, are shown, for example, in 
DE-A-39 05 355 and DE-C-31 03 321. In DE-C-31 03 321, ring 
recesses which accommodate the rubber elastic ring, are 
provided in both the swing pipe and the wearing ring. The 
recesses face each other and extend under the ends of the 
rubber elastic ring.  
 One problem is that abrasive material can penetrate into the 
area of the ring recesses and behind the rubber elastic 
ring. On the side of the swing pipe, the abrasive material 
can penetrate the radial gap between the wearing ring and 
the swing pipe and emerge through the radial gap to the 
outside, whereas the abrasive material penetrating the 
eccentric relief between the wearing ring and the sealing 
ring typically cannot pass into the pipe when the pressure 
is relieved. The latter situation leads to an axial bracing 
of the tube switch, thus making switch-through operation of 
the tube switch tight and, in turn, promoting wear. Additionally, the eccentric relief is gradually filled with 
hardened abrasive material and, as result, with increasing 
wear and the increasing axial air, the flexible sealing ring 
can be pulled toward the inside of the pipe and, in turn, 
become lost. This problem occurs particularly when the 
sludge pump
