<ABSTRACT>
A method of fabricating a radiation imager with strong 
structural integrity and adhesion between the scintillator and 

photosensor array includes the steps of forming a photosensor array 
on a substrate; depositing a barrier layer over the photosensor array, 

the barrier layer having an upper surface of silicon nitride; treating the 
silicon nitride upper surface of the barrier layer to prepare the surface 

for the deposition of material thereover; and depositing a scintillator 
material over the treated upper surface of the barrier layer. The 

silicon nitride upper surface of the barrier layer is typically treated by 
etching the surface, such as in a reactive ion etch, for a selected 

amount of time, with less than about 500 Å of material being removed 
from the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solid state imagers,
such as an x-ray imager which typically includes a
photosensor array coupled to a scintillating medium.
Radiation absorbed in the scintillator generates optical photons which
in tum pass into a photosensor, such as a photodiode, in which the
optical photon is absorbed and an electrical signal corresponding to
the incident optical photon flux is generated. Substantially
hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si) is commonly used in the
fabrication of photosensors due to the advantageous photoelectric
characteristics of a-Si and the relative ease of fabricating such
devices. In particular, photosensitive elements, such as photodiodes,
can be formed in connection with necessary control or switching
elements, such as thin film transistors (TFT's), in a relatively large
array. The fabrication of such arrays is facilitated by the use of a-Si,
which is used in the formation of both the TFT's and the photodiodes.
Fabrication of the array is also facilitated by the deposition of a
scintillator material directly over the photosensor array, but care must
be taken to both protect the components of the photosensor array and
ensure structural integrity of the scintillator/photosensor array
assembly.The performance of amorphous silicon based imagers
can be degraded by a number of factors, including, for example,
exposure to moisture (which can cause the leakage of a-Si
photodiodes to increase irreversibly), exposure to materials, such as
solvents used in the fabrication process, that degrade the electrical
characteristics of the a-Si photodiode or may damage the polymeric
dielectric materials, or by exposure to temperatures higher than those
of the a-Si deposition processes (e.g., greater than about 250°C). It is 
thus beneficial to provide a protective boundary for a-Si components
to minimize degradation both in fabrication and during operation of
the imager. A protective boundary disposed between the a-Si
components of the photosensor array and the scintillator in an imager
desirably provides 1) protection of the photosensor array from
contamination by the scintillating medium (and vice versa); 2) a
surface to which the scintillator material can adhere well; 3) good
optical coupling between the scintillator and the underlying pixels in
the imager array (that is, a high degree of transmission of the optical
photons with a minimum of scattering of the photons); and, 4) a good
environmental barrier to protect the photosensor array, especially
from moisture.Direct application of
