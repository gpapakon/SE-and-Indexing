<ABSTRACT>
A papermaking process which includes preparing a 
papermaking stock and delivering that stock to the headbox 

of a papermachine for deliver onto a machine wire, draining 
the stock on the wire and processing the backwater or white 

water thus obtained to generate two fractions one of which 
fractions has a higher solids content than the other 

fraction, delivering the fraction having a high solids 
content for use in preparing papermaking stock and 

discharging the fraction having a low solids content to 
waste or for re-use as process water in another part of the 

process.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a papermaking process and 
apparatus for use therewith. More particularly, it is 
concerned with such a process and apparatus having as its 
purpose to improve the retention of solids materials within 
the process, thereby reducing both materials wastage and the 
unacceptable discharge of such materials as effluent into 
the environment. Extensive amounts of water are used in the 
papermaking process. A substantial proportion of this water 
is continually recycled within the process, but for 
practical reasons, it is necessary to introduce a quantity 
of fresh water, thereby necessitating the discharge of a 
similar amount as waste in order to keep the system in 
balance. Depending upon the level of water re-usage in the 
system, the fresh water introduced can be from 10 to 50 m3 
per tonne. The papermaking process involves the slushing 
together of papermaking fibres and water in a machine such 
as a hydrapulper to form an aqueous slurry. The papermaking 
fibres may be introduced as sheet woodpulp or (where the 
papermachine forms part of an integrated pulping and 
papermaking process) as a pulp slurry fed from the pulp 
mill. Mineral fillers may also be added at this stage, 
typically being china clay, calcium carbonate or titanium 
dioxide. The slurry from the pulper is held in stock chests 
and then fed through refiners and stock cleaners to the 
paper machine after dilution to a suitable consistency. 
Small quantities of polyelectrolyte may also be added so as 
to improve retention of the solids materials after the  
 
aqueous dispersion has been laid down to form a web on the 
papermachine wire. As the web progresses along the papermachine, it 
progressively drains, assisted by foils and vacuum boxes and 
a small proportion of the fibrous and mineral components of 
the stock are lost during the drainage process. At the same 
time, a substantial amount of fresh water is used in order 
to clean the papermachine wire after the web has been 
formed. Fresh water is also used for other purposes in the 
machine, for example pump gland seals. The added fresh 
water represents a typical increase of about 30% in the 
total volume of water drained through the wire. The drained 
water is commonly referred to as backwater, or sometimes as 
white water due to the appearance conferred by the entrained 
fibrous and mineral residues. It is therefore normal 
practice to recycle the backwater or white water to a 
backwater tank from which it can be withdrawn to feed the 
hydrapulper during

A papermaking process which includes preparing a 
papermaking stock and delivering said stock to the headbox 

(10) of a papermachine for delivery onto a machine wire 
(13), draining the stock on the wire (13) and processing 

the backwater thus obtained to obtain a first fraction 
which has a higher solids content than a second fraction 

characterised by delivering said backwater to a centrifugal 
and sedimentation separator device (2) which comprises a 

tank (40) open to atmosphere in which the backwater is 
introduced tangentially to produce a slow peripheral 

rotation defining a single vortex with low turbulence to 
cause the solids to migrate towards an outer annular region 

adjacent a peripheral wall of said tank and to sediment 
towards a bottom of the tank, withdrawing said first 

fraction from the bottom of the tank and delivering it for
