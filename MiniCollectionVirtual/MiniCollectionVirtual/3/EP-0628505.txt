<ABSTRACT>
The device has suction heads (18) anchored on a continuously rotating rotor (10) by means of a pivoting arm (20) in each case. The pivoting arms (20) are driven in respect of their pivoting position by means of a pivoting drive (44), which is superimposed on the rotary drive (14, 16) of the rotor (10), in such a way that they move into the transfer position in thrust operation and leave this position in trailing operation. At the point of reversal, the suction heads have time to become attached to the edge of the respective outermost product; by means of their tilting movement at the point of reversal, the product edge picked up is clearly and reliably separated from the adjacent product. In conjunction with a removal device having circulating grippers following on from one another, the edge of the products is placed in the grippers (58) by the suction heads (18) which are pivoted during the circulation.

Apparatus for individually separating stacked 
printing products, having controllable suction heads 

which circulate in a plane perpendicular to the stack, 
are mounted in a rotor and can be moved individually by 

means of a drive superposed on the rotary drive and 
which, in a takeover region, suck against the outermost 

product and separate it from the stack for the purpose of 
transfer to a transporting-away device, characterized in 

that the suction heads (18) are anchored on the rotor 
(10) in each case by means of a swivel arm (20) which is 

connected substantially rigidly on the suction head (18) 
and the free end of which is guided during the rotation 

by means of a follow-up control (44) with a follow-up 
roller (30, 32) engaging in a control link (38) which is 

stationary and closed in itself, the swivel arms (20) 
running into the takeover point (50) in pushing operation 

and leaving the latter in pulling operation, so that, 
starting from the takeover point (50), the swivel arms 

(20) are driven in a swivelling manner forwards in the 
direction of rotation (88) and are held thus swivelled 

until delivery to the transporting-away device (56). 
Apparatus according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the follow-up control (44) is arranged on the rear 

side, facing away from the swivel arms (20), of the rotor 
(10), the swivel arms (20) being connected by means of 

spindles (22) passing through the rotor (10) to control 
levers (28) bearing the follow-up rollers (30, 32). 
Apparatus according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the rotor (10) is designed as a rotary slide valve  

 
(24), which communicates via connecting channels (70) 

with the suction heads (18) and interacts with an 
assigned control surface of a valve body (60), there 

being provided on the control surface control slits (62, 
64) connected to a vacuum source and to the atmosphere, 

respectively. 
Apparatus according to Claim 3, characterized in 

that the spindles (22) passing through the rotor (10) are 
designed as connecting channels (70) of the rotor (10) to 

the suction heads (18). 
Apparatus according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the valve body (60) is located in a central opening 

of the rotor (10) and is connected to the vacuum source 
by a line (65) enclosed by the control link (38). 
Apparatus according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the control link (38) is provided in an insert (42) 

which is fastened in a removable manner in the rotor 
housing (13) and also bears the valve body (60). 
Apparatus according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the valve body (60) is arranged at a distance in 

front of the insert (42) and the control link (38) has, 
engaging partially under the valve body (60), an inner 

track (34) and an outer track (36), the control levers 
(28) being of a two-armed design and each control lever 

(28) bearing on its one arm a follow-up roller (30) for 
the one track (34) and on its other arm a follow-up 

roller (32) for the other track (36) of the control link 
(38). 
Apparatus according to Claim 7, characterized in 
that the one track (36) is lower than the other track 

(34). 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 8, 
characterized in that the suction heads (18) are 

connected to their spindles (22) in a resiliently (78, 
84) inwardly repressible manner. 
Apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 9, 
having a transporting-away device (56), which is provided 

with circulating controlled grippers (58) following one 
after the other at regular intervals, characterized in  

 
that the path of movement (54) of the grippers, facing 

substantially downwards with the gripper mouth in the 
transfer region, runs above the stack support for an 

upright stack (48) and is laterally offset with respect 
to the orbit (90) of the suction heads (18); and in that 

the control link (38) has following after the takeover 
point (50) a rising flank (47), the suction heads (18) 

being swivelled up from the takeover point (50) in the 
direction of the grippers (58) into a transfer point 

(72). 
Apparatus according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that the orbit (90) of the suction heads (18) is taken 

around the transfer point (72), and the suction heads (18) 
are arranged at such intervals from one another that 

there are respectively suction heads (18) both in the 
takeover point (50) and in the transfer point (72). 
Apparatus according to Claim 11, characterized in 
that the stack support is preceded by a feeding device 

(86), driven continuously or periodically in accordance 
with the proceeding individual separation.
