<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a novel process for forming metal matrix composite bodies. Particularly, an infiltration enhancer and/or an infiltration enhancer precursor and/or an infiltrating atmosphere are in communication with a filler material or a preform, at least at some point during the process, which permits molten matrix metal to spontaneously infiltrate the filler material or preform. Such spontaneous infiltration occurs without the requirement for the application of any pressure or vacuum. The molten matrix metal is provided in a unique manner which enhances the spontaneous infiltration process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel process for forming metal
matrix composite bodies. Particularly, in a preferred method of the
present invention for forming metal matrix composites by a spontaneous
infiltration technique, an infiltration enhancer and/or an infiltration
enhancer precursor and an infiltrating atmosphere are in communication
with a filler material or a preform, at least at some point during the
process, which permits molten matrix metal to spontaneously infiltrate the
filler material or preform. Such spontaneous infiltration occurs without
the requirement for the application of any pressure or vacuum. The molten
matrix metal and the filler are provided in a unique manner which enhances the spontaneous
infiltration process.Composite products comprising a metal matrix and a strengthening or
reinforcing phase such as ceramic particulates, whiskers, fibers or the
like, show great promise for a variety of applications because they
combine some of the stiffness and wear resistance of the reinforcing phase
with the ductility and toughness of the metal matrix. Generally, a metal
matrix composite will show an improvement in such properties as strength,
stiffness, contact wear resistance, coefficient of thermal expansion
(C.T.E.), density, thermal conductivity and elevated temperature strength
retention relative to the matrix metal in monolithic form, but the degree
to which any given property may be improved depends largely on the
specific constituents, their volume or weight fraction, and how they are
processed in forming the composite. In some instances, the composite also
may be lighter in weight than the matrix metal per se. Aluminum matrix
composites reinforced with ceramics such as silicon carbide in
particulate, platelet, or whisker form, for example, are of interest
because of their higher specific stiffness (e.g., elastic modulus over
density), wear resistance, thermal conductivity, low coefficient of
thermal expansion (C.T.E.) and high temperature strength and/or specific
strength (e.g., strength over density) relative to aluminum. Various metallurgical processes have been described for the
fabrication of aluminum matrix composites, including methods based on
powder metallurgy techniques and liquid-metal infiltration techniques
which make use of pressure casting, vacuum casting, stirring, and wetting
agents. With powder metallurgy techniques, the metal in the form of a
powder and the reinforcing material in the form of a powder, whiskers,
chopped fibers, etc., are admixed and then
