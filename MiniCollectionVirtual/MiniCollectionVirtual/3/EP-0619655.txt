<ABSTRACT>
The structure includes an elongate coil (L1) between one input (E1) and an output (A1). This is bridged by three resistors (R1 - R3) connected in series. A shunt coil (L2, L3) is connected at the nodes between each pair of resistors (R2 and R3, or R1 and R2). The coil outputs are connected together and are connected to a shunt capacitor (C1). The output of the latter is connected to the base line between a second input (E2) and output (A2) of the filter. The middle resistor (R2) is carrier frequency dependent. This resistor allows the filter to be automatically tuned to the carrier frequency.

Radiofrequency rejection filter for arrangement 
in a low-voltage network which is used for carrier-frequency 

message transmission, characterized in that the 
filter is constructed as a broadband filter with the 

following bridged twin-T structure: 

a) arranged between a first filter input (E1) and a 
first filter output (A1) is a longitudinal coil 

(L1), which is bridged by a series circuit formed by 
a first fixed resistor (R1), a carrier-frequency-dependent 

resistor (R2) and a second fixed resistor 
(R3), 
b) a first bypass coil (L2) is connected to the junction 
point between the first fixed resistor (R1) and 

the carrier-frequency-dependent resistor (R2), and 
a second bypass coil (L2) is connected to the junction 

point between the carrier-frequency-dependent 
resistor (R2) and the second fixed resistor (R3), 
c) the outputs of the two bypass coils (L2, L3) are 
connected to one another and to the input of a 

bypass capacitor (C1), the output of which is connected 
to the base line between the second input 

(E2) and second output (A2) of the filter. 
Radiofrequency rejection filter according to 
Claim 1, characterized in that the carrier-frequency-dependent 

resistor (R2) takes the form of a secondary 
winding (S) of a transformer (Ãœ), which secondary winding 

is connected in series with the fixed resistors (R1, R3), 
an electronic actuator (OK) being connected in parallel 

with the primary winding (P) of the said transformer, and  
 

in that means (W) are provided which alter the effective 
resistance of the electronic actuator (OK) as a function 

of the carrier frequency. 
Radiofrequency rejection filter according to 
Claim 2, characterized in that there is arranged a 

frequency/voltage converter (W), the input of which is 
coupled to the low-voltage network via a transformer (T), 

and the output of which is connected to the electronic 
actuator (OK). 
Radiofrequency rejection filter according to 
Claim 2 or 3, characterized in that an optocoupler is 

used as the electronic actuator (OK). 
Radiofrequency rejection filter according to one 
of Claims 2 to 4, characterized in that a protective 

resistor (R4) is connected between the frequency/voltage 
converter (W) and the electronic actuator (OK). 
Radiofrequency rejection filter according to one 
of Claims 3 to 5, characterized in that the primary 

winding of the transformer (T) is connected to the low-voltage 
network via a capacitor (C2).
