<ABSTRACT>
A wall for a display case comprises, in a structure reinforced by stiffening bars, two parallel uprights (13, 14) forming at least in part a slideway for a plurality of superimposed slats (12), the two uprights forming the two lateral sides of a single U-shaped frame (11), with a cross member (15) fixed securely to the bottom ends of the two uprights. The stiffening bars (16, 17; 16A, 17A; 16B, 17B) securely fastened to the uprights and to the cross member are all situated inside the outer edge (24, 25; 24A, 25A; 24B, 25B) of the frame. The single U-shaped frame comprising a channel profile each side of the slideway is formed between one of the two flanges (20, 21) of the upright (13, 14) and an opposing face of the associated stiffening bar (16, 17).
