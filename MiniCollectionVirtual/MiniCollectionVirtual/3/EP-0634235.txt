<ABSTRACT>
A straightening machine for rolled profiles (beams) (1, 2, 49), especially H-profiles (I-section beams), in which at least one of the two straightening discs (7, 8 or 107, 108; 36, 37) carried by a straightening shaft (3) and bearing from the inside on the profile flanges (10), is axially adjustable, makes it possible to change the external or chamber dimension of the straightening discs rapidly and in a simple manner if a worm gear (15, 16; 35) is used for displacement of the straightening discs.

<CLAIMS>
Straightening machine for rolled profiles, especially H-profiles, in 
which at least one of the two straightening plates (7, 8; 107, 108; 36, 

37) contacting the profile flanges (10) from inside, supported by an 
alignment shaft (3) on an mounting bushing (5) is axially adjustable 

by means of a drive (15, 16; 35) in order to adjust the external 
dimension of the straightening plates,
characterized in that
 
the drive is a worm gear drive and that the straightening plate(s) (7, 

8 or 107, 108 respectively) is (are) rigidly connected with a ring 
sleeve (26) or displacement bushing (24) directly actuated by the 

worm gear (15, 16; 35) and axially movable on the mounting 
bushing (5). 
Straightening machine according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the worm wheel (18, 19) between the straightening plates (7, 8 or 

107, 108 respectively) is mounted on a mounting bushing (5) 
encompassing the alignment journals (4) of the alignment shaft (3) 

and has on both sides hubs (23) which have an external thread (24) 
engaging with a corresponding internal thread (25) of
 the ring 
sleeves (26).  

 
Straightening machine according to claim 1 or claim 2,
characterized in that
 
each ring sleeve (26) is attached to the relevant straightening plate 

(7, 8 or 107, 108 respectively) by means of a screwed connection 
(27). 
Straightening machine according to one of claims 1 through 3,
characterized in that
 
the worm casing (20) is connected with the ring sleeve (26) by 

means of a torque support (28). 
Straightening machine according to claim 1,
characterized in that
 
the worm wheel (40) is positioned with a clearance in front of the 

outer straightening plate (37) facing the free end of the aligning 
shaft (3) in the bushing body (12) of a clamping head (11) and 

interlocks on the one hand with the worm (39) mounted in the 
bushing body (12) and on the other hand by means of an internal 

thread (41) with an external thread (42) of the displacement 
bushing (44). 
Straightening machine according to one of claims 1 through 5,
characterized in that
 
the displacement bushing (44) or the axially movable straightening 

plates (7, 8 or 107, 108 respectively) is or are positioned on parallel 
key guideways (13, 14; 43) of the mounting bushing (5). 
Straightening machine according to one of claims 1 through 6,
characterized in that
 
the axially movable straightening plates (7, 8 or 107, 108 

respectively) are clamped with a clamping head (11) against 
threaded rings (31, 32).
