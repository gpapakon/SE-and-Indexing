<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for building tyres, in which use is made of a so-called "shaping" building drum which includes a turn-up membrane (2) external to each bead housing (6) and means for clamping (flanging) the said membrane. The said clamping means include, in the example described, a set of blades (11) which can open out into a fan and cover the turn-up membrane completely in the circumferential direction and partially in the axial direction. The axial movement of the said blades (11), which is controlled by the axial movements of two pistons (7) and (8), makes it possible to modify the appearance of the turn-up membrane (2).

A process for the building of a tyre having
reinforced beads, comprising the following steps:


using a shaping building drum equipped at each of
its ends with at least one turn-up membrane (2)

extending axially beyond recesses (6) which
receive the beads of the tyre;
disposing or producing, on said drum, a quasi-cylindrical
sleeve constituting the blank of a

carcass comprising the bead reinforcements;
radially expanding the portion (M) of the sleeve
located between the bead recesses while bringing

the bead recesses (6) together in order to impart
a substantially toroidal shape to said portion of

the sleeve (M);
defining a useful surface on at least one radially
outer wall of the turn-up membrane (2), between

the axially inner edge thereof, located at the
level of the recess of the beads (6), and clamping

means (11) applied on said membrane (2) at least
along a clamping circle of variable diameter

concentric to the drum, so as to create a
provisional support for the membrane, clamping the

latter at a preselected point on said membrane in
the meridian direction;
inflating the turn-up membrane (2) to construct
the beads and/or the sidewalls of the tyre while

imposing upon said clamping means (11) a
combination of axial and radial movements in order

to control continuously and permanently the shape
and the deformation of said useful surface,

between the provisional support of the membrane,
which is immovable in the meridian direction with

respect to the surface thereof, and the inner edge
of said membrane (2), so that said useful surface

forms a dome constituting a protuberance radially 
at a higher level than said clamping circle, for

every axial position of said clamping circle along
the useful course thereof.
A process according to Claim 1, characterised
in that the radius of curvature of the meridian profile

of the membrane (2), axially to the outside of each
recess of the bead (6), decreases continuously, while

the point of tangency of said membrane with the portion
(M) of the sleeve axially to the inside of the bead

recesses moves radially towards the outside under the
action of a combination of radial and axial

displacements of the clamping means.
A process according to Claim 2, characterised
in that the axially outermost ends of the products to

be turned up are, for the greater portion of the
turning-up operation, located on a circle of a radius

less than the distance to the axis of the point of the
membrane located furthest radially to the outside.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the portions (F) of the sleeve

located axially to the outside of the bead recesses (6)
are turned up and applied onto the portion (M) of the

sleeve located axially between the bead recesses in
order in this way to form the beads.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that the portions (F) of the sleeve

located axially to the outside of the bead recesses are
turned up and applied onto the shaped portion (M) of

the sleeve located axially between the bead recesses,
up to the radially outermost point of said portion of

the sleeve (M) located between the bead recesses.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that having deflated a turn-up

membrane (2) so that the useful surface of said
membrane resumes a quasi-cylindrical configuration, new

components are disposed on the outer surface of the 
membrane whereupon they are turned up in the same

manner.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterised in that the turned-up products are formed

of the different rubber mixes of the sidewall of the
tyre.
A tyre building machine having two
cylindrical half drums which are concentric and movable

axially with respect to each other, each covered by at
least one annular membrane (2) at their axially

outermost ends, said membrane forming, with zero
pressure, a quasi-cylindrical external surface on

which the different components of the tyre are placed,
comprising a blocking means (1) for the beads which is

located radially below the recesses (6) receiving the
beads, characterised in that it comprises:


clamping means (11) associated with the turn-up
membrane (2), axially to the outside of the recess

(6) receiving the bead, said clamping means acting
on at least one clamping circle of variable

diameter concentric to the drum, clamping said
membrane at a preselected point thereof in the

meridian direction and defining a useful surface
on the radially outer wall of said membrane

between the axially inner edge thereof located at
the level of the recess of the beads and said

clamping means,
means for preventing the meridian sliding of the
turn-up membrane with respect to the clamping

means (11),
drive means making it possible to impose any
combination of axial and radial displacements on

said clamping means (11) so as to control
continuously the axial and radial positions of the

resting points of the turn-up membrane (2) on said
clamping means.
A machine according to Claim 8, characterised
in that the clamping means of each turn-up membrane (
2)
outside of the bead recess (6) includes an assembly of

metal pallets (11) which can open in fan shape and
cover said membrane (2) completely in the

circumferential direction, even in expanded state, and
only in part in axial direction as from the axially

outermost point of said membrane.
A machine according to Claim 9, characterised
in that the pallets (11) on each half drum are

connected to a ring (13) which is concentric to said
frame (18) and movable axially with respect to said

frame (18) carrying the pallets (11) with it.
A machine according to Claim 10,
characterised in that each pallet (11) is fastened on a

articulation (17) on the ring (13), said lever (16)

being in contact with a cam (15) of suitable profile.
A machine according to Claim 11,
