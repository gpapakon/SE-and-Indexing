<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for determining heavy 
hydrocarbons contained in rock matrices. The invention also relates to an apparatus for effecting said 
determination. The term "heavy hydrocarbons" is intended to mean hydrocarbons 
containing 15 or more carbon atoms. Analysis of the biological markers present in sedimentary rocks or 
in fossil materials is a problem of fundamental importance in 
organic geochemistry. A generally used method for analyzing said rocks comprises-firstly 
extracting the rock with a suitable solvent, then analyzing the 
extracts by GC-FID or GC-MS. This method is however costly 
because it requires a rather lengthy time for extracting the rock 
matrix and also because sometimes the extracts cannot be 
immediately used for gas-chromatography analysis because further 
preparative chromatography separation steps are required. 
An alternative method is based on thermal desorption (TD), 
consisting of vaporizing (by heating to a temperature of about 
320°C) the compounds contained in the rock and then directly  
 
analyzing them by GC. This method operates in the following manner:
 
a sample of sedimentary rock in powder form is placed in a sample 
tube closed at one end by an inert material, preferably glass 
wool, and the sample tube filled in this manner is placed in a 
seat through which an inert gas stream passes;
 
using a suitable program, the temperature of the sample tube is 
raised to the desired value, usually about 320°C;
 
the gas stream conveys the hydrocarbons desorbed from the rock to 
a cryogenic trap, the purpose of which is to condense said 
hydrocarbons;
 
the gas flow to the sample tube is interrupted and the cryogenic 
trap containing the condensates is heated; gas-chromatography 
analysis by temperature gradient is simultaneously commenced; 
the inert gas stream, its passage through the sample tube being 
interrupted, now passes though the heated trap and transfers the 
hydrocarbons to the gas-chromatography column, which is provided 
with a splitter to enable the required gas quantity to be fed 
through. This method has the drawback that the heavy hydrocarbons are often 
retained in the rock matrix, so falsifying the result of the 
analyses, which are aimed mainly at ascertaining the type and 
quantity of heavy hydrocarbons present in the matrix. A method obviating the aforesaid drawbacks has now been found for 
analyzing the hydrocarbons contained in sedimentary rocks, which 
represents a modification to the thermal desorption analysis 
method.

<CLAIMS>
A method for separating and analyzing the hydrocarbons, 
particularly heavy hydrocarbons, contained in sedimentary rocks, 

characterised by comprising the following steps: 

A) loading a sample tube with the sample of sedimentary rock and 
one or more inert solvents able to extract the hydrocarbons 

contained in the rock; 
B) preheating the thus loaded sample tube to a temperature of 
between 60 and 150°C and maintaining it at this temperature in an 

inert gas atmosphere; 
C) heating the sample tube in an inert gas stream to a 
temperature such as to remove the solvent and the hydrocarbons 

previously contained in the rock; 
D) condensing the vapour conveyed by the inert gas in a 
refrigerated container; 
E) heating said container and feeding the contents by means of 
said inert transport gas to a separation and analysis means.
