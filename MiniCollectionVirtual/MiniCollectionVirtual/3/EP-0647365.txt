<ABSTRACT>
A power controller device (10) is provided which controls the power output to a resistive load, such as a water heater (2) or baseboard heater. The device is programmed to output predetermined power levels or to energize the load to predetermined temperatures during predetermined time intervals, thus taking advantage of times during the day when power usage is low, and minimizing usage of power during times when demand is high. A voltage detection circuit monitors the supply voltage, and can increase power or temperature to the load during times of over-voltage or can disable the load during brownout or blackout conditions. Power is reduced through a convention means such as "cycle-stealing", and power can be output to the load in fractions of the maximum output power level. When the load is first activated, power is supplied in gradually increasing levels, to avoid a sudden power surge. The power controller device (10) may control a stepper motor actuating a by-pass valve, where a water heater is provided with a heater exchanger, or otherwise actuating a mixing valve.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a power controller device comprising:
a power input circuit for receiving input power from an
electrical power source;a power output circuit for supplying output power to a
load;a voltage detector for sensing the voltage of said
electrical power source; anda controller responsive to said voltage detector.The invention relates in particular to a power controller
device for controlling electrical power consumed by resistive
load devices, such as electric water heaters, electric
baseboard heaters, brick heaters and the like. Large electrical utilities use several different kinds of
generating means to generate electrical power. These include
hydro electric and nuclear, as well as coal and oil fired
generators. Generally, hydro electric and nuclear power
generators provide the base energy required and coal and oil
fired generators are operated only during "on-peak" load
periods when larger amounts of electricity are required to meet
additional demand. The additional energy generated during the
on-peak periods by oil and coal fired generators tends to be
more expensive for the utility companies to generate.
Therefore, the utility companies greatly benefit to the extent
that power consumption can be shifted from "on-peak" periods to
"off-peak" periods when demand for electrical power is lower.In addition, hydro electric and nuclear generators must operate
continuously and cannot be turned off even when the power
generated by these generators is not needed. This condition,
when the general power consumption drops below the power which
is capable of being produced by the continuous generating
means, is generally called "free wheeling". Any energy not used
during these periods is wasted. In addition, it is not always
possible to predict when "free wheeling" conditions will exist.Power controller devices have previously been developed in
attempts to shift the power demands from on-peak periods to
off-peak periods. Such prior art power controller devices have
essentially comprised timers which turned electrical resistive
load devices on and off, so that the load devices were off
during on-peak periods when electrical power demands are high
and on during off-peak periods when power demands are lower.There are a number of difficulties inherent in such prior art
devices. First, by only being able to turn the load devices on
and off, the prior art power control devices did not adequately
control the resistive load devices. Secondly, because the 
timers were preset, and because the prior art
