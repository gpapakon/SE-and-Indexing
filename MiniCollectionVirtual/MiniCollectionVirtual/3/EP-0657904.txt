<ABSTRACT>
A coil taping unit is provided wherein tape is wound on a rotating bobbin by 
gripping the end of the tape and pulling it out from a guide, cutting the tape using a 

cutter after part of it is caused to adhere to the bobbin, and pressing the cut tape on 
the bobbin. By arranging the guide to comprise a plurality of guide parts that guide a 

plurality of tapes, and a mechanism that moves these guide parts between a tape 
supply position and a non-supply position in front of a chuck, tapes of different 

thickness can be accurately wound. Further, by providing a plurality of parallel press 
parts that elastically push the tape towards the bobbin and an actuator that moves 

these press parts, tapes of different thickness can be wound on the bobbin under a 
uniform pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a taping unit having an automatic coil winder which
attaches tape to a coil bobbin.Some types of coil winders which perform automatic winding of a coil are provided
with a taping unit for winding insulating tape on a coil bobbin before wire is wound on
the coil, or on a coil bobbin after wire is wound on the coil.In such a taping unit, the end of the insulating tape is for example grasped by a
moving chuck, tape is pulled out from a tape reel, and the tape is wound on a winding
area by bringing the tape so withdrawn into contact with the area and rotating the
bobbin. After a predetermined length of tape has been wound, the tape is cut by a
cutter, and the end of the cut tape is pressed on the coil by a moving press mechanism.Depending on the specification of the coil, however, wire may be wound only in
the center of the bobbin and not on either side of the center. In such a coil, the
winding area may for example be determined by winding barrier tapes of predetermined
thickness at both ends of the coil bobbin before the wire is wound on the coil.However, as the thickness and width of the barrier tapes are different from those
of ordinary insulating tape, various disadvantages arise due for example to changing
over the tape reel if the same taping unit is used.Further, if tapes of different width are used, the winding position of the tape on 
the coil easily slips away from the axial direction of the coil.Still further, if barrier tapes of different thickness to the left and right of the coil
wire are wound on the bobbin, the pressing force of tile press mechanism is biased
towards the thick barrier tape with the result that the thin barrier tape may not be
sufficiently pressed on the bobbin.It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a taping unit which allows
correct taping of tapes having different width and/or thickness.It is a further object of this invention to prevent stretching when the tape is cut if
thin tape is used.In order to achieve the above objects, this invention provides a coil taping unit
which winds a tape on a rotating bobbin wherein the unit comprises a guide that
guides the tape, a chuck that grips an end of the tape guided by said guide and pulls
it out from the guide , a mechanism that causes part of the tape thus withdrawn to
adhere to the bobbin, a cutter that cuts the tape adhering to the bobbin between the
guide and the tape chuck, and a device that presses the cut tape on said bobbin, the
unit being characterized in that the guide
