<ABSTRACT>
A telephone subscriber system comprising a speech circuit 
(SPC) and a ring circuit (RIN) adapted to be integrated 

monolithically to a semiconductor material substrate (G) 
and being coupled to a telephone subscriber line (SL), 

respectively through first (PP) and second (PR) circuit 
means of the diode bridge type, further comprises a first 

circuit changeover means (SW1), under control by the 
user, which drives at least second (SW2) and third (SW3) 

circuit changeover means connected between the first 
diode bridge circuit (PP) and the speech circuit (SPC). 
The third circuit changeover means (SW3) is connected to 
the speech and ring circuits at a circuit communication 

node (G) which forms the system point of reference, 
physically coincident with the substrate. The system 

includes a circuit interface means (CL) for controlling 
the second (SW2) and third (SW3) circuit changeover means 

by external electrical signals which are related to the 
circuit communication node (G).

connected with its cathode to the circuit communication 

node (G), in parallel with the third circuit changeover 
means (SW3).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telephone devices for
subscriber systems, in particular telephone subscriber
devices adapted to be monolithically integrated.In telephone circuits of the one-chip type which serve
multiple functions normally performed by discrete
integrated circuits such as modern speech, ring, and tone
circuits -- the system common point of reference, both
physically and electrically, is an individual one
coinciding with the substrate of semiconductor material
whereto the whole one-chip circuit is integrated.In a telephone subscriber system, the speech circuit and
ring circuit are both coupled to, and energized through,
the telephone line.During the ring phase, however, any coupling of the two
circuits together must be prevented, as by disconnecting
the speech circuit through switches, whereas during the
speech phase, the ring circuit must be disabled.Current telephone company standards, moreover, call for
the ring circuit to be DC uncoupled from the telephone
line for any line polarity. This requires, as is well
recognized by the skilled ones in the art, either the
provision of a dual RC network, or the inclusion of a
traditional electric switch which can be readily
integrated.Understandably, the last-mentioned solution is the one
which would normally be utilized wherever the telephone
circuits involved are of the one-chip type.In a telephone subscriber system, the speech phase is
initiated by clamping the DC line to the speech circuit 
as the handset is picked up or, in more sophisticated
designs, on a pulse being issued from a keyboard.A single-chip telephone line interface of this type is for
example described in the article entitled: "A single-chip
telephone line interface in BCD technology", by Consiglio et
al., IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference,
February 1992, New York, US.This telephone interface circuit includes a speech circuits
discoupled by the telephone line by means of switches driven
by a keyboard switch.But, if one wishes to clamp the line to the speech circuit
without picking up the handset and without acting physically
on the telephone apparatus as by keying in -- operation from
an external electric control being preferred instead --
problems may arise from that the line polarity is undefined
and the line own reference potential is other than the
reference potential of the one-chip circuit, i.e. its
substrate.In fact, an input terminal of the device -- namely that
connected to the terminal of the polarity bridge, which
would usually be a diode bridge enabling
