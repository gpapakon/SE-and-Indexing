<ABSTRACT>
A supported conductive network (SCN), which can be flexible or rigid, can have self-aligning conductors (14) which connect with corresponding conductors (6) of other networks. The conductive network (10) can be fabricated into densely packed contact clusters for use as electrical interconnectors or circuits. The method and apparatus for making the conductive network (10) involve forming a sheet of conduct material (22) into ridges (24) and troughs (26) one of which defines the conductive network and the other of which is waste material and then mechanically removing the waste material. The conductive network thus formed is supported by a dielectric layer (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGH DENSITY CONDUCTIVE NETWORKS AND METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING SAMEThis invention generally relates to supported conductive networks (SCN) , flexible or rigid, and their manufacture. In particular, this invention relates to such conductive networks which have densely packed conductive paths (HDSCN) , and to a method and apparatus for making the conductive networks. Background of the InventionDevelopments in the electronics industry require the use of more densely packed electrical modules and circuits, each requiring multiple interconnections to one another. However, there is a practical limit to the density that can be achieved using conventional connective networks. In a typical present day application* a floppy disk drive may require a connection to a recording head whose conductors are only on the order of 0.2 mm (0.008 inches) on center and associated jumper conductors must have a similar spacing. Further, recent liquid crystal displays have conductors which are even more closely packed, for example, 0.1 mm (0.004 inches) on center, with similar requirements for interconnection conductors. in addition, there is growing use of ceramic PC boards to accommodate multiple IC chip arrays which also require high density connectors and custom interconnect cables for purposes of terminating those components.As a direct result of the growth in the circuit board industry, there has been a parallel increase in the volume of environmentally-hazardous chemicals generated by the conventional etching and deposition processes. For example, it is not uncommon for one circuit board fabrication facility to generate 4,000 litres (1,000 U.S. 

gallons) per day of photo resist stripper and 4,800 litres (1,200 U.S. gallons) per week of developer solution. These toxic wastes must be transported off-site for proper disposal at hazardous waste management sites. Thus, there is an urgent need for a non-chemical method for the manufacture of conductive networks.It is an object of this invention to provide a relatively inexpensive, high-quality, densely packed, supported conductive network for use in fabricating rigid or flexible circuit boards, that can be built without the use or generation of environmentally hazardous chemicals.Another object of the invention is to provide a flexible conductive network having conductive paths which are profiled to self-align with corresponding conductors of other conductive networks.Yet another object of the invention is to provide methods of making conductive networks having one or
