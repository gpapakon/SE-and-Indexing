<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a sliver piecing machine (20) which 
can decrease the time of the sliver piecing work and which permits 

replacement of an empty can row by a full sliver can row between the work of 
cutting the spun sliver and the subsequent sliver piecing work. The sliver 

piecing machine (20) is moved along traveling rails (18) placed 
above the can rows. A 

housing of the sliver piecing machine (20) has a sliver cutting device 
and a 

sliver piecing device which are respectively provided on the front and 
rear 

sides in the direction of movement of the sliver piecing machine (20) 
along the 

traveling rails. The sliver piecing machine (20) performs only the 
sliver cutting 

work in the forward movement thereof, and only the sliver piecing work in 
the backward movement. After the sliver cutting work, the empty can row is 

replaced by the full can row, and the sliver piecing work is then performed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sliver piecing method according to claim 1 and a sliver
piecing machine according to claim 7.Various kinds of automation have recently been made for saving
human labor and improving productivity in a spinning mill, and automation of
the sliver piecing work in a spinning machine such as a roving frame, a
drawing frame or the like has also been proposed (for example. see Japanese
Patent Laid-Open No. 2-91233). In this case, as shown in Fig. 44, cans 202
containing sliver S under spinning, and full sliver cans 203 in reserve
containing sliver S to be newly supplied are disposed adjacent to each other
in plural rows along the lengthwise direction (the direction vertical to the
drawing of Fig. 44) of a roving frame 201. A sliver piecing machine 204 is
moved on traveling rails 206 which are extended along the can rows above
feed rollers 205 for guiding the sliver S to the roving frame 201. The feed
rollers 205 are respectively disposed opposite to the centers of the cans
202 and 203 above the can rows along the lengthwise direction of the roving
frame 201. The sliver piecing machine 204 is provided with an arm 208
having a sliver holding unit 207 and a sliver piecing unit 209. The arm 208
is formed so as to be extension and horizontally movable in the direction
vertical to the feel rollers 205.In the sliver piecing work, the sliver S which is being spun and
which is continued from the roving frame 201 is introduced into the
introduction portion of the sliver piecing unit 209 and is held by the
sliver piecing unit 209. In spinning, the sliver S is introduced into the 
introduction portion of the sliver piecing unit 209 by a sliver taking-in
arm (not shown) provided on the sliver piecing unit 209. The sliver holding
unit 207 then holds the sliver S on the upstream side of the sliver piecing
unit 209 (on the side of the cans), and is moved in the direction away from
the sliver piecing unit 209 to cut the sliver S. The sliver holding unit
207 then holds the end of the sliver S contained in the full sliver can 203
and introduces the end into the introduction portion of the sliver piecing
unit 209 so as to overlap the introduced end and the end of the cut sliver
held by the sliver piecing unit 209. In the state wherein the overlapped
portions of both slivers S are held, the sliver holding unit 207 is then
moved in the direction away from the sliver piecing unit 209 to cut the new
sliver S. The slivers are then pieced together by operation of the sliver
piecing unit 209. Namely, in

<CLAIMS>
A method for piecing slivers in a spinning machine
(1) including a plurality of spinning units and a row of

sliver cans (6) from which slivers (S) are supplied to the associated
spinning units, the piecing method comprising moving

an automatic machine (20) provided with a sliver piecing unit
(29) along the row of sliver cans (6), cutting slivers spun by

the associated spinning units, and piecing together the cut
sliver ends and new slivers,
characterized in that

slivers (S) spun by and extending from all or plural spinning
units are cut successively so that the resulting sliver cut

ends are freely suspended and thereafter the sliver cut ends
are successively pieced with new contained in full sliver cans

(6F).
A method according to claim 1, wherein empty cans
(6) and full cans each containing a sliver to be newly supplied

are separately arranged along the lengthwise direction
of said spinning machine, and after the sliver is cut, said

empty cans are replaced by said full can, and the end of the
cut sliver and the sliver of said each full can are then

pieced together. 
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized by

the steps of:

   cutting the sliver to be pieced with another sliver in the
forward movement of said automatic machine (20) from a first

end side of said can row to a second end side thereof; and
piecing together the cut sliver end and the sliver of each

sliver can containing a sliver to be newly supplied in the
backward movement from the second end side of said can row to

the first end side thereof.
A method according to claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that

in a parallel arrangement of sliver cans under spinning and
reserve sliver cans, a sliver to be pieced with another sliver

is cut by a sliver cutting device provided on the front side
