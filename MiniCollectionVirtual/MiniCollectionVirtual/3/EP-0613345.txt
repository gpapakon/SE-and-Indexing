<ABSTRACT>
An epilator has a housing and at least a clamping member comprising a screw-shaped spring (8) for grasping the hairs to be removed and a drive for moving the clamping member (8) with respect to the hairs and to the housing. Guiding member (15) that precedes the clamping device (8) in the advance direction of the latter with respect to the hairs is linked to the drive, thus considerably increasing the reliability with which the hairs to be removed are grasped, with a simple design.
