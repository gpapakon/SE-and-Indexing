<ABSTRACT>
A method for flocculating finely divided particles 
suspended in nonpolar liquids, thereby facilitating the 

removal of these particles by sedimentation or 
filtration, by treating the contaminated nonpolar liquids 

with from about 0.01% to about 5% by weight of a 
flocculant comprising a water soluble organic compound 

having a cationic quaternary nitrogen or ammonium group. 
The flocculants useful in the method of the invention are 

desirably miscible or dispersible in the nonpolar liquid, 
and carrier solvent or surfactant may be used to improve 

dispersibility of the flocculant.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for flocculating
finely divided solids suspended in nonpolar liquids and
to chemical compositions which are useful in such method.The process for flocculation is widely known and used in
the treatment of water and waste water. Through the use
of flocculation, finely divided suspended particles are
agglomerated to permit improved separation by
sedimentation, filtration, or other conventional
techniques. A general discussion of flocculation is
found in PERRY'S CHEMICAL ENGINEER'S HANDBOOK, 4th. Ed.,
which is incorporated by reference herein. While the
process of flocculation is widely known and practised in
the treatment of water and waste water, the chemicals,
compounds and polymers that function well as flocculants
in aqueous systems are not generally effective for use in
such nonpolar solvents as liquid hydrocarbons.Liquid hydrocarbons and other nonpolar solvents are
widely used for removing oily soils and in other
processes whereby they become contaminated with finely
divided suspensions of soil particles, carbon particles,
tar, carbonised hydrocarbons, and the like. One example
of such contamination occurs in solvents used in
automotive parts washers. Often a substantial portion of
the contaminants are so small that they are present as a
colloidal suspension and are not readily removed by
settling or filtration.Prior art flocculants and flocculating methods have
previously been disclosed, for example, in United States 
Patent Nos. 4,038,176; 4,230,839; 4,584,111, 4,745,154;
4,778,813; 5,130,358; 4,522,729 and 4,789,460.U.S. 4,038,176 discloses and claims the use of soluble
cationic polymers as flocculants for the coagulation of
colloidal suspensions in oil, particularly used motor
oil. The preferred polymer is an oil soluble polymer
having a molecular weight of at least 10,000 which is
selected from the group consisting of polymers of fatty
diallyl quaternary ammonium salts and fatty acid salts of
polymers of tertiary amino substituted acrylamides.U.S. 4,230,839 discloses and claims polymers of
quaternary ammonium adducts that are useful for
clarifying water containing oil or suspended solids and
especially oil-coated solids.U.S. 4,584,111 relates to the use of an acrylamide
polymer to aid in the removal of colloidal particles
generated in the manufacture of lubricating oil
additives such as zinc salts of
dihydrocarbyldithiophosphoric acid and calcium phenate.
More particularly, the patent discloses and claims
introducing at least a flocculating amount of a
