<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a random access method in a radio system comprising a plurality of radio stations (RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6) and at least one base station (BS) serving said radio stations, in which method the base station (BS) transmits an invoking message (HPK) to the radio stations (RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6) in a first time slot to grant the radio stations (RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6) the right to send a random access message (HP) to the base station (BS), one of the radio stations (RS1) transmits a random access message HP(S1) containing a random identifier (S1) to the base station (BS) in a second time slot (A1) subsequent to the first time slot, the base station (BS) transmits a response message V(S1, TT7, A1) containing the random identifier (S1) to said radio station (RS1) in a third time slot (A6) subsequent to the second time slot. In order that the problem which is caused if the same telecommunications resource is allocated to several radio stations could be avoided, the response message V(S1, TT7, A1) sent by the base station (BS) to said radio station (RS1) in the third time slot contains the identifier (A1) of said second time slot (A1).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a random access method 
in a radio system comprising a plurality of radio 
stations and at least one base station serving said 
radio stations, in which method the base station 
transmits an invoking message to the radio stations in 
a first time slot to grant the radio stations the right 
to send a random access message to the base station, one 
of the radio stations transmits a random access message 
containing a random identifier to the base station in 
a second time slot subsequent to the first time slot, 
the base station transmits a response message containing 
the random identifier to said radio station in a third 
time slot subsequent to the second time slot. It is generally known to use a random access 
method in the implementation of control channel operation, 
in connection with the registration of a radio 
telephone in a network, and in call establishment. By 
means of the random access method a radio telephone, 
typically a mobile radio, connected via a radio path to 
a base station and thus to a radio telephone network, 
informs the base station that it wishes to use the 
signalling capacity of the system. A radio telephone 
needs signalling capacity in order to be able to use a 
speech channel or to send for instance messages, such 
as short messages. A typical random access method currently used 
is the so-called slotted Aloha method, which is 
described in Computer Networks by A. S. Tanenbaum, 1981, 
Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, pp. 249-323, particularly 
pp. 253-257. The use of the slotted Aloha method 
in connection with modern radio systems is described 
more closely in the standard MPT 1327, 1991, "A Signalling 
Standard for Trunked Land Mobile Radio Systems",  
 
Radiocommunications Agency, London, Chapter 1.3.3 and 
particularly Chapter 7. The slotted Aloha method is a 
random access method in which a radio telephone can 
attempt access to the control channel only within 
accurately defined time slots. The control channel is 
a radio channel or a time divided part of a radio 
channel used by a base station for call establishment 
in radio communication between it and mobile stations, 
i.e. radio telephones and other radio equipment. Typically, 
a base station transmits repeatedly - although at 
intervals it has defined, and irregularly if necessary - 
call attempt invocations, i.e. invoking messages, to 
radio telephones within the coverage area of its own 
transmitter. By means of the invoking message it has 
sent, the base station defines one or

A random access method in a radio system 
comprising a plurality of radio stations (RS1, RS2, RS3, 

RS4, RS5, RS6) and at least one base station (BS) 
serving said radio stations, in which method 


the base station (BS) transmits an invoking 
message (HPK) to the radio stations (RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, 

RS5, RS6) in a first time slot to grant the radio 
stations (RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6) the right to 

send a random access message (HP) to the base station 
(BS), 
one of the radio stations (RS1) transmits a 
random access message HP(S1) containing a random 

identifier (S1) to the base station (BS) in a second 
time slot (A1) subsequent to the first time slot, 
the base station (BS) transmits a response 
message V(S1, TT7, A1) containing the random identifier 

(S1) to said radio station (RS1) in a third time slot 
(A6) subsequent to the second time slot, 
the method being 
characterized
 in 
that 
the response message V(S1, TT7, A1) sent by the 
base station (BS) to said radio station (RS1) in the 

third time slot (A6) contains the identifier (A1) of 
said second time slot (A1). 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that said identifier (A1) of the 
second time slot is the consecutive number of said 

second time slot calculated from the time slot (A1) 
following said invoking message (HPK). 
A method according to claim 1, 
charac-terized
 in that said identifier (A1) of the 
second time slot is the identifier of the consecutive  

 
number of the time slot in accordance with the frame 

structure of the radio system. 
A method according to claim 1, 
characterized
 in that the base station (BS) sends the 
identifiers of the time slots to the radio stations 

(RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6). 
A method according to claim 4, 
characterized
 in that the base station (BS) sends the 
identifiers of the time slots to the radio stations 

(RS1, RS2, RS3, RS4, RS5, RS6) as part of said invoking 
message.

characterized
 
in that the base station (BS) sends the 

identifiers of the time slots to the radio stations

message.
