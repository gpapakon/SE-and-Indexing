<ABSTRACT>
A magnetoresistive (MR) sensing system comprises an MR sensor (20) 
with 

a layered spin valve structure including thin first (28) 
and second (34,38) 

layers of ferromagnetic material separated by a thin layer (32) 
of nonmagnetic 

metallic material. The magnetization direction of the first layer at a zero 
applied magnetic field is substantially parallel to the longitudinal 

dimension of the MR sensor and substantially perpendicular to the fixed or 
"pinned" magnetization direction of the second layer. A thin keeper layer 

(24) of ferromagnetic material is separated by a thin spacer 
layer (26) from the 

layered spin valve structure. This keeper layer has a fixed magnetization 
direction substantially opposite that of the second layer and a moment-thickness 

product substantially equal to that of the second layer for 
cancelling the magnetostatic field from the second layer. A current flow 

is produced through the MR sensor to produce a magnetic field of a sign and 

magnitude which cancels the ferromagnetic exchange coupling between the 
first and second layers. Variations in resistivity of the MR sensor due to 

difference in rotation of the magnetizations in the first and second layers 
are sensed as a function of the magnetic field being sensed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a magnetoresistive sensor such as that used 
in high-performance magnetic random access disk drives. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent 5,159,513 discloses a magnetoresistive 
(MR) sensor that utilizes the spin valve effect. The sensor comprises a 
rectangular multi-layered structure deposited on a glass or other suitable 
substrate. The multi-layered structure includes a "free" layer of soft 
magnetic material and a "pinned" layer in which the magnetization is fixed 
in a direction parallel to the width of the sensor by use of a hard magnetic 
material as the first layer or, if preferred, by use of an antiferromagnetic 
layer to pin the first layer by exchange coupling. The free and pinned 
layers are separated by a thin nonmagnetic metallic spacer layer, such as 
of copper. The magnetization of the free layer is normally in a direction 
along the length of the sensor, but is free to rotate therefrom in a 
positive or negative transition direction through an angle determined by the 
magnitude of the magnetic field being sensed. In a spin valve structure, the change in resistance is proportional 
to the change in the angle between the directions of the magnetization in 
the two magnetic layers (i.e., the free layer and the pinned layer). The 
change in resistance of this multilayered structure relative to a constant 
background value is then proportional to sin ϑ averaged over the height of 
the sensor, where as heretofore indicated, ϑ is the angle of the 
magnetization in the free layer with respect to the longitudinal axis of the 
sensor. Because the resistance change is proportional to sin ϑ, the signal 
produced by the sensor will be linear throughout the applied field for small 
field values. However, the sensor output becomes nonlinear when the free 
layer is magnetically saturated during a positive or negative excursion of 
the applied field and thus limits the peak-to-peak signal that can be 
produced by the sensor. The ideal quiescent magnetic state for the sensor is achieved when ϑ 
= 0 over the entire height of the free layer. This ideal quiescent state 
is that which is furthest from magnetic saturation under both positive and 
negative field excitations. It generates an ideal bias profile that 
maximizes the linear dynamic range to provide a larger signal output and/or  
 
improved linearity. However, this ideal bias profile cannot be achieved 
with spin valve structures disclosed in this cited patent or any other prior 
art known to applicants. This inability to obtain
