<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to certain novel heterocyclic derivatives which are 1-pyridylacetamide derivatives of formula (I), set out herein, which are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as human neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such inhibition is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, diagnostic and related studies and in the treatment of diseases on mammals in which (HLE) is implicated. The invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these heterocyclic derivatives, processes for preparing the heterocyclic derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing such heterocyclic derivatives and methods for their use.

<DESCRIPTION>
ALPHAAMIN0B0R0 IC ACID PEPTIDES AND THEIR USE AS E STASE INHIBITORSThe present invention relates to certain heterocyclic derivatives, in particular, certain 1-pyridylacetamide compounds, which are inhibitors of human leukocyte elastase (HLE), also known as human neutrophil elastase (HNE), making them useful whenever such inhibition is desired, such as for research tools in pharmacological, diagnostic and related studies and in the treatment of diseases in mammals in which HLE is implicated. For example, HLE has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, pulmonary emphysema, and other inflammatory disorders, including airway inflammatory diseases characterized by increased and abnormal airway secretion such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. Also, HLE has been implicated in certain vascular diseases and related conditions (and their therapy) in which neutrophil participation is involved or implicated, for example, in hemorrhage associated with acute non-ly phocytic leukemia, as well as in reperfusion injury associated with, for example, myocardial ischaemia and related conditions associated with coronary artery disease such as angina and infarction, cerebrovascular ischaemia such as transient ischaemic attack and stroke, peripheral occlusive vascular disease such as intermittent claudication and critical limb ischaemia, venous insufficiency such as venous hypertension, varicose veins and venous ulceration, as well as impaired reperfusion states such as those associated with reconstructive vascular surgery, thrombolysis and angioplasty. The invention also includes intermediates useful in the synthesis of these heterocyclic derivatives, processes for preparing the heterocyclic derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing such heterocyclic derivatives and methods for their use.In U.S. Patent 4,499,082, of 12 February 1985, assigned to E. I. DuPont De Nemours and Company, there is disclosed a series of peptidyl boronic acid derivatives as reversible inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes, including HLE. It is well known that boronic acid derivatives, such as for example the corresponding esters, readily may be hydrolyzed under the in vitro and in vivo conditions in 

which they are tested and used. In U.S. Patent 4,910,190, of 20 March 1990, assigned to ICI Americas Inc. (now ZENECA Inc.), there is disclosed a series of peptidoyl trifluoromethane ketone derivatives which are HLE inhibitors. Disclosed herein is a series
