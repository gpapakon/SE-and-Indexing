<ABSTRACT>
In a process for firing ceramics or the like in a periodically operating kiln, the firing shelves (13) which receive the ware to be fired are assembled on a ramp located in front of the kiln (1) to form a firing charge. The introduction of this firing charge into the firing chamber (1a) is effected by means of a mobile hearth bogie (8) having a height-adjustable upper part (10) in a single working step, the firing chamber (1a) of the kiln (1) being closed directly after the introduction by lowering the upper part (10) of the hearth bogie (8).

<CLAIMS>
Arrangement for the combustion of ceramic or like combustible material, with a
hearth carriage furnace (1), the furnace base (6, 22) of which is coupled to a movable

hearth carriage (8), which has an upper part (10) adjustable in height, wherein the furnace
base (6, 22) is placeable on an edge (17a, 17b) at the furnace side walls (17, 18),

characterised in that the furnace (1) has a furnace door (2) at at least one of its end faces,
and at the base side the furnace side walls (17, 18), the fumace door (2) and the fumace

base (6, 22) itself are provided with mutually matched, profiled, edge regions sealed
around, that the furnace base (6, 22) is designed at its upper surface facing the

combustion chamber (1a) of the fumace (1) for reception of at least one combustion shelf
(13), wherein a spacer frame (12) is provided between fumace base (6, 22) and the

combustion shelves (13) and that the furnace (1) is associated with ramps (16, 19)
disposed in front and behind, which are matched to the movable and height-adjustable

hearth carriage (8) and are constructed for temporary reception of the combustion shelves.
Arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that the furnace base (6, 22) is
at the same time the upper part (10) of the hearth carriage (8).
Arrangement according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the furnace base (6,
22) is equipped with exhaust gas flues (21), which close off with exhaust gas flue ducts

(23) disposed in the building floor.
Arrangement according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the furnace
base (6, 22) and/or the carriage (8) as well as the associated stroke unit consist of several

segments due to the weight of combustible material to be borne.
