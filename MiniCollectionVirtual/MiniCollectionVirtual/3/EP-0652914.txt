<ABSTRACT>
A non-silicone release material for use with pressure sensitive adhesives, which contains a copolymer of: (1) an acrylate ester of formula (I) wherein x ranges from about 30 to about 50; and (2) at least one comonomer selected from a vinyl monomer, an acrylate monomer or a methacrylate monomer. Preferably, the acrylate ester is about 1 to about 25 % by weight of the copolymer composition. The release material can be used as backsize for pressure sensitive adhesives, particularly repositionable labels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a release material for a pressure
sensitive adhesive. More particularly, the invention relates to a non-silicone
polymer suitable for use as a release material for repositionable adhesives,
and capable of being selectively modified to achieve a particular desired
release power.Rolls of pressure sensitive adhesives typically have a release agent,
often called a "backsize", applied to the back side of the adhesive substrate
to permit easy unwinding. Such release agents or backsizes are particularly
crucial if the adhesives are stored for long periods of time.It is important that release materials do not adversely affect the
adhesive properties of the adhesive materials they contact. Also, release
materials should be capable of maintaining their effectiveness over prolonged
periods of time and upon exposure to a wide range of temperatures.Traditionally, silicone compounds have been used as release materials
for the various types of pressure sensitive adhesives. However, the release
power of silicone compounds is generally very high. For many applications
that require lower release power, such as the repositionable adhesives, the
high release power is undesirable.US-A-4299741 and US-A-4342815 disclose adhesive tapes
comprising release polymers having long chain acrylate esters copolymerised
with other acrylic monomers. The alkyl chains in the acrylic esters contain
from 12 to 24 carbon atoms.The principal advantage of the present invention is the provision of a
release material for pressure sensitive adhesives that substantially obviates
one or more of the limitations and disadvantages of the described prior
release materials. The present invention is directed to a release
material for pressure sensitive adhesives that has a
relatively low release power.The invention is also directed to a release
material for pressure sensitive adhesives that can
be modified to provide the desired release power.The invention is also directed to a release
material suitable for use with repositionable
pressure sensitive adhesives.The invention is also directed to a release
material for pressure sensitive adhesives that does
not adversely affect the adhesive properties of the
adhesive material upon contact.The invention is further directed to a release
material for pressure sensitive adhesives that
maintains its release properties over time and
exposure to elevated temperatures.Additional features and advantages of the
invention will be set forth in the written
description which follows, and in
