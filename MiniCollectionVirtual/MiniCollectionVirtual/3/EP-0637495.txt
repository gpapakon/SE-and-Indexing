<ABSTRACT>
A local pressurizing type injection molding apparatus 
including a stationary die (12), a movable die (14) disposed for 

movement into and out of contact with the stationary die, a 
first local pressurizing pin (34) extending through the movable 

die (14) and having a tip facing a gate (20), and a second local 
pressurizing pin (35) extending through the movable die (14) and 

having a tip facing the cavity (21). The apparatus is further 
provided with first advancing mechanism for advancing the 

first local pressurizing pin (34), second advancing mechanism 
for advancing the second local pressurizing pi
n (35), and a 
device for individually setting the points of time at which 

advancing movements of the first local pressurizing pin (34) and 
the second local pressurizing pin (35) are started and for 

individually setting the pressurizing pressures given by the 
first local pressurizing pin (34) and the second local 

pressurizing pin (35). One processing action is given to a mold 
product by advancing the first local pressurizing pin (34) while 

another processing action is given to the mold product by 
advancing the second local pressurizing pin (35). Accordingly, 

in the case where two or more kinds of processing operations 
are performed, the processing operations can be started at 

different points in time and can be effected with different 
pressures.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus and
method for local pressurizing type injection molding.In a conventional injection molding machine, a screw is
disposed in a heating cylinder for rotational and
reciprocating movement with respect to the heating
cylinder. In a metering stage, the screw is retracted while
being rotated so as to accumulate a molten resin in front
of the screw, and in a charging stage, the screw is
advanced to inject the molten resin into a cavity in a die
through an injection nozzle, thereby filling the cavity with
the molten resin.The die is composed of a stationary die and a movable
die. The movable die is advanced and retracted by a mold
opening/closing apparatus so that the movable die contacts
and separates from the stationary die. Resin is charged
into the cavity after mold closing, in which the movable
die is contacted with the stationary die, and mold clamping,
in which the movable die is pressed against the stationary 
die. After cooling, the resin becomes a molded product.
Subsequently, mold opening is effected for separating the
movable die from the stationary die, and the molded product
is thrust out by projecting an ejector pin from the
stationary die.In the resin charging stage, the resin injected from
the injection nozzle enters a runner through a sprue and is
then charged into the cavity through a gate. In the case
where the gate is a submarine type, a portion of the molded
product corresponding to the gate (hereinafter referred to
as a "gate portion") is automatically broken and is
separated from the molded product when the molded product
is thrust out. However, a mark formed due to the gate
(hereinafter referred to as "gate mark") or flashes are left
on the molded product from which the gate portion has been
separated. Accordingly, further processing is needed to
remove the gate mark or flashes, resulting in increased
costs.To obviate the above-described problem, a local
pressurizing type injection molding machine has been
proposed in which a pressurizing pin is disposed at a
location corresponding to the gate portion and is advanced
to close the gate. In this case, generation of a gate mark
and flashes can be prevented.In addition, it is possible to dispose another 
pressurizing pin other than the pressurizing pin for gate-closing
to perform a processing operation on a molded
product as well as to perform gate-closing. However, the
timing at which the gate-closing is started cannot be made
different from the timing at which the processing operation
is
