<ABSTRACT>
A combustionless measurement method and apparatus are described for ascertaining the quality and/or quantity of gaseous fuels fed to gas consumption devices, and particularly natural gas consumption devices. The technique utilizes a novel empirical algorithm for correlating easily measured gas parameters to any one of the: heating value of the fuel gas; density of the fuel gas; and percent concentration of inert gases within the fuel gas. Sensed fuel gas parameters can include any combination of viscosity, thermal conductivity, specific heat, and optical absorption, etc., at more than one temperature if needed for accuracy. Specific structures are set forth for implementing the technique.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the combustionless measurement of the quality of gaseous fuels
fed to gas consumption devices, and particularly natural gas consumption devices.US-A-4,956,793 describes a method and apparatus for measuring the density of fluids. The
specific gravity of a fluid is determined based on thermal conductivity and specific heat.
The apparatus uses a proximately positioned resistive heater and thermal sensor elements
coupled by the fluid of interest. Pulses of electrical energy are applied to the heater of a
level and duration such that both a transient change and a substantially steady-state
temperature occur in the sensor. The thermal conductivity is determined based upon sensor
output at steady state elevated temperature, and the specific heat is determined based upon
the rate of change of sensor output during a time interval of transient temperature change
in the sensor. The specific gravity then is determined from the thermal conductivity and the
specific heat by using an empirical polynominal formula.GB-A-22 54 924 filed April 9, 1991 and published October 21, 1992 describes fuel density
determination from sensors of temperature, dielectric constant and velocity of sound
mounted on one or more probes in the fuel. A micro processor monitors the sensor output
and determines the type of jet fuel and the density of the fuel using data from fuel samples
of a known density and a least-squares-fit of the test data.US-A-4,885,938 dealing with flow meter fluid composition correction uses thermal
conductivity, specific heat and density of the fluid for correcting a mass flow meter with
respect to changes in composition of the fluid. The specification mentions that a micro
anemometer sensor can be used for direct measurement of thermal conductivity and
specific heat by generating an energy or temperature pulse in one or more heater elements
disposed and closely coupled to the fluid. Characteristic values of thermal conductivity and
specific heat cause corresponding changes in the time-variable temperature response of the
heater to the pulse. Under relatively static sample flow conditions, this in turn induces 
corresponding changes in the time-variable response of a temperature-responsive sensor
coupled to the heater via the fluid medium.The article of Gas Research Institute, December 1984; A. N. J. Pearmann, Low-Cost Gas
BTU Meter Using Physical Property Measurements, pages 2 - 13 to 2 - 18, describes an
algorithm for the examination of gas properties. The algorithm described in this
