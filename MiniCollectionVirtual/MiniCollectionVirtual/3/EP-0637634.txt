<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing a metal melt (6), in particular a steel melt (6), in an electric arc furnace (1), the bath surface (8) is covered with a foam slag (9) during the flat bath period(s). In order to secure the advantages of an electric arc enclosed by foam slag over a long time period with the lowest possible expenditure, during one furnace batch, the level of the layer height (10) of a slag is repeatedly measured and a foam slag (9) enclosing an electric arc (4) formed by at least one electrode (3) is formed by blowing solids, gases or a mixture of solids and gases into and/or onto the slag or the metal melt (6), the height (10) of the layer of which foam slag being dimensioned such that the foam slag extends at least over the entire electric arc (4) so that a number of advantages are optimally exploited (Fig. 1).
