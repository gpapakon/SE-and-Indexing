<ABSTRACT>
The safety valve (1) of a safety device for limiting load moments has two control elements (6, 7) which are acted upon by the pressure to be monitored and change over in defined sequence during increasing pressure and of which the control element (6) changing over first interrupts in the process the previously existing connection between shut-off member (S) and pressure-medium reservoir (T), and the control element changing over subsequently in the process opens the previously blocked connection between the pressure (P) to be monitored and the shut-off member (S). To prevent leakage, the two control elements (6, 7) are designed as separate seat valves (8, 9) and are preloaded via a common spring arrangement (3), the defined change-over sequence being ensured via different sealing diameters or additional preloading at one of the seat valves (8, 9).

<CLAIMS>
A safety device, in particular for limiting the load moment in vehicle cranes or the like,
with a safety valve (1) which can be acted upon by the pressure of a pressure-medium

circuit to be monitored, and at least one cut-off member which can be actuated by
pressure medium and is connected to the said safety valve (1) and which influences control

devices of the pressure-medium circuit in the sense of limiting the pressure whilst a
critical pressure is exceeded, wherein the safety valve (1) comprises two pre-stressed

switching members (6, 7) which are acted upon by the pressure to be monitored and
which are changed over in a defined sequence as the pressure is increased and of which

the first switching member (6) to change over interrupts the previously existing connexion
between the cut-off member and the pressure-medium reservoir and the second

switching member (7) to change over opens the previously blocked connexion of the
pressure to be monitored to the cut-off member, 
characterized in that
 the two switching
members (6, 7) are constructed in the form of separate seat valves (8, 9), are pre-stressed

by way of a common spring arrangement (3) and are acted upon by the pressure to be
monitored.
A safety device according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the effective sealing diameters
of the two seat valves (8, 9) are of different size, and/or an additional prestressing

spring is arranged at one seat valve (8, 9).
A safety device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the pre-stressing of the
common spring arrangement (3) is adjustable.
