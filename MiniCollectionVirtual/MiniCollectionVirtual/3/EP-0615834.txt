<ABSTRACT>
A protector (50) made of thermoplastic resin to which a foaming agent is 
added is adapted such that no foams are present in the thermoplastic resin 

forming a predetermined volume area including lock portions (54) mounted on 
a protector body (51) for integrating the protector body (51) and a lid element 

(52) but foams are present in the thermoplastic resin forming the area other than 
the predetermined volume area, whereby a molded part of thermoplastic resin 

is provided which accomplishes weight reduction and an insured strength at a 
strength-required area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of fabricating a molded
part made of foamed thermoplastic resin employed as a protector or the
like for an automotive wire harness.A wire harness for wiring in an automotive electric system is protected by
a protector 100 shaped as shown in Figs. 8A and 8B, for example, which has
an opening and closing lid 101 on one side surface thereof so as not to be
damaged by a flash formed by punching in a press molded vehicular body.
Such a protector 100 includes lock portions 102 for fixing the opening and
closing lid 101 in a closed state after the wire harness is housed in the protector
100, and a bolting portion 103 for fixing the protector 100 to the vehicular
body.There has been a need for weight reduction of automotive vehicles for
various reasons, and the protector 100 is no exception. In general, the above-mentioned
protector 100 is fabricated by injection molding using thermoplastic
resin such as polypropylene. One of the approaches to reduce the weight of a
molded part of thermoplastic resin is to foam the molded part. Such a foamed
molded part is achieved by adding a foaming agent to thermoplastic resin,
plasticizing the thermoplastic resin, and injecting the plasticized thermoplastic 
resin into a mold.Although required to be reduced in weight, the protector 100 shown in
Figs. 8A and 8B includes local areas required to have a strength higher than
that of the other areas, such as the lock portions 102 and bolting portion 103.
However, when the molded part of resin is foam molded in the conventional
manner such as the protector 100, foams are present in the resin forming the
lock portions 102 and the bolting portion 103, resulting in an insufficient
strength of the lock portions 102 and the bolting portion 103.FR-A-2 377 269 and BE-A-786 847 disclose injection-moulding processes in
which a blend of molten injection-moulding material and blowing agent is
introduced into the cavity of a mold.Once the cavity has been filled, the blend is submitted to a pressure
greater than the blends forming pressure and then the pressure obtained in
the mold cavity is reduced by enlarging said cavity.The present invention is also intended for a method of fabricating a molded
part of thermoplastic resin. According to the present invention, the method 
comprises the steps of: feeding a thermoplastic resin material and a foaming
agent into a cylinder of an injection molding machine having a nozzle
communicating with an injection gate; rotating a screw disposed in the cylinder
