<ABSTRACT>
A multi-hole ceramic plate used as a heat-conductor support of a heating insert for industrial furnace construction is described, the outer contour of the ceramic plate being given an undulating shape according to the invention, with continuous transitions between the peaks and the valleys of the undulations. In addition, the bearing length of the heating conductors in the guide bores of the ceramic plate is considerably reduced by bevelling the guide bores for the heating conductors.

Multi hole ceramic plate used as a heat conducting element 
support for the heating of electric furnace installations with 

a central hole (3) at the axis of symmetry (4) of the ceramic 
plate for a supporting member, and additionally with several 

holes (6) uniformly distributed in at least one coaxial circle 
(1,2) for heat conductors and with several recesses (10) on the 

edge (5) of the ceramic plate uniformly distributed around the 
periphery of the ceramic plate, characterized in that, 

the recesses provided at the periphery of the ceramic plate are 
rimmed by a waveform with circularities formed by the peaks (9) 

and troughs (10) of the waveform (5) and constant transitions 
between the circularities (9, 10), whereby the holes (6) in the 

external circle of holes (2) are positioned relative to the 
waveform (5) in such a way that the distance between these 

holes (6) and the waveform edge (5) of the plate is as constant 
as possible. 
Ceramic plate according to Claim 1, characterised in that, 
the diameter of the holes (6) provided for the heat conductors 

is tapered to make it larger on the outside of at least one end 
of the hole concerned (6), whereby in these holes (6) the 

transition (R) between the cylindrical part (7) of the bore (6) 
and the tapered part (8) of the bore (6) is curved and the 

cylindrical part (7) of the bore (6) is less than half the 
thickness of the ceramic plate, preferably less than a quarter 

of the plate thickness. 
Ceramic plate according to Claim 2, characterized in that, 
the cylindrical part (7) of the bore is maximum 5 mm long, 

preferably between 0.5 mm and 2 to 3 mm.
