<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electric immersion heater, the heating element of 
which terminates in at least one cold tail (27). Said cold tail have a first 

portion connected to a resistance heating wire (28) of said element, and a 
second portion extending beyond the end of the element sheath (12). The 

connection of the heating wire (28) occurs via a intermediate sleeve (30).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tubular heating element of the kind which is used
in liquid heating vessels or containers such as washing machines, urns, jugs,
kettles or the like. Such tubular heating elements are conventionally mounted
on an element head by means of which the heating element is mounted in an
opening in the vessel or container wall, the heating element being disposed
within the vessel or container with the ends thereof however extending
through the head and thus being accessible from outside the vessel or container
for making of electrical connections to the heating element.The heating element comprises an outer tubular sheath usually but not necessarily
of circular cross-sectional shape of a suitable metal e.g. copper or
stainless steel, a ferrous alloy resistance heating wire in the form of a
helically wound coil extending axially through the sheat and being spaced
therefrom by an electrical insulating material such as magnesium oxide which
also serves to conduct heat from the wire to the surrounding sheath and
thence to the liquid to be heated.The heating wire does not extend to the ends of the sheath but rather stops
short of the ends and is continued at each end by a so-called "cold tail"
i.e. a metal rod of much greater diameter than that of the heating wire and
offering by comparison with the heating wire little electrical resistance so
as not to be resistively heated in use of the tubular heating element to any
significant extent. The cold tails are usually made of mild steel and are
welded to the ends of the resistive heating wire. Moreover, the cold tails
extend beyond the ends of the sheath of the heater element, the ends of the
sheath arround the cold tail being sealed by an electrically insulating and
water impervious sealing material e.g. an epoxy resin. The exposed ends of
the cold tails thus constitute the electrical terminals of the heating
element and electrical connections thereto can be made in any desired manner.From the European Patent Application 0 086 465 a tubular heating element is
known wherein the heating wire is pushed onto and welded on the end of a cold
tail being formed by a bolt. In the case that said bolt is of a material with 
high thermal conductivity it could be possible that during the fastening
process of the wire onto said bolt by means of welding or the like, said bolt
could be damaged due to its softness so that said wire can be released from
said bolt.It is an object of the present invention to provide a tubular heating element
mentioned above
