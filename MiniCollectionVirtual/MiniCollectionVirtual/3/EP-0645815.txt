<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high power
semiconductor device module. A preferred embodiment
relates to a power module containing a plurality of
high voltage and high current semiconductor switching
devices which are connected electrically in parallel
and operated at high frequency.Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs)
are an extremely attractive semiconductor device for
power applications. They are more attractive than a
power-type insulated gate field effect transistor
(IGFET), which is popularly referred to as a MOSFET.
An IGBT can handle both high voltages and high
currents with small die size and with relatively low
"on" resistance. In addition, an IGBT can be switched
rapidly, making IGBTs potentially useful as switches
in a three phase inverter for a high power alternating
current motor application.On the other hand, the high current density
capability and low "on" resistance of the IGBT also
present new challenges. The possibility of device
failure is aggravated when the IGBT is handling high
power. By high power, we mean current densities above
about 135 amps per square centimetre of active chip
area, at hundreds of volts. By high frequency
switching we mean on/off frequencies above about 18
kilohertz, for example 30 kilohertz. As might be
expected, significant impedance, material and
mechanical problems are encountered in handling such
power at high frequencies and low resistances. This
is especially true for a high power/high frequency
module, in which several such IGBTs are connected
electrically in parallel. Heretofore, the foregoing
problems have been so difficult that not many high
power/high frequency IGBT modules have been 
commercially manufactured. Those made thus far have
been made in relatively low volume, such that each
module could be individually specially crafted.The present invention seeks to provide an
improved semiconductor device module.Electronic Design, vol. 41, no. 15
(22.07.1993), page 35, D.Maliniak, "Power package
purges wire bonds and their inductance" describes a
module in accordance with the preamble of Claim 1. A subassembly similar to those specified in claim 1 is also known from FR-A-2 452 178.
JP-A-62-150871 describes a semiconductive device of a
switching module having elements disposed on
concentric circles in a geometrically symmetrical
manner. EP-A-0427143 describes a semiconductor module
having at least one half-bridge with two
series-connected semiconductor switches.A high power/high frequency transistor
