comprising administering to a human in need of treatment 

an effective amount of a compound having the formula 

Wherein R¹ and R³ are independently hydrogen, 
-CH₃, 


or 

wherein Ar is 
optionally substituted phenyl;

 
   R² is selected from the group consisting of 

pyrrolidine and piperidino; or a pharmaceutically

<DESCRIPTION>
Endometriosis is a condition of severe
dysmenorrhea, which is accompanied by severe pain, bleeding
into the endometrial masses or peritoneal cavity and often
leads to infertility. The cause of the symptoms of this
condition appear to be ectopic endometrial growths which
respond inappropriately to normal hormonal control and are
located in inappropriate tissues. Because of the
inappropriate locations for endometrial growth, the tissue
seems to initiate local inflammatory-like responses causing
macrophage infiltration and a cascade of events leading to
initiation of the painful response. The exact etiology of
this disease is not well understood and its treatment by
hormonal therapy is diverse, poorly defined, and marked by
numerous unwanted and perhaps dangerous side effects.One of the treatments for this disease is the
use of low dose estrogen to suppress endometrial growth
through a negative feedback effect on central gonadotropin
release and subsequent ovarian production of estrogen;
however, it is sometimes necessary to use continuous
estrogen to control the symptons. This use of estrogen can
often lead to undersirable side effects and even the risk
of endometrial cancer.Another treatment consists of continuous
administration of progestins which induces amenorrhea and
by suppressing ovarian estrogen production can cause
regressions of the endometrial growths. The use of chronic
progestin therapy is often accompanied by the unpleasant
CNS side effects of progestins and often leads to
infertility due to suppression of ovarian function.A third treatment consists of the administration
of weak androgens, which are effective in controlling the
endometriosis; however, they induce severe masculinizing
effects. Several of these treatments have also been 
implicated in causing a mild degree of bone loss with
continued therapy.Therefore, new methods of treating endometriosis
are desirable.This invention provides the use
of a compound of formula I

   Wherein R1 and R3 are independently hydrogen,

wherein Ar is
optionally substituted phenyl;R2 is selected from the group consisting of
pyrrolidino and piperidino; and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts and solvates thereof, for the preparation of a medicament
for inhibiting endometriosis.The current invention concerns the discovery
that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes
(benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for
inhibiting endometriosis. The medicaments
provided by this invention are administered
to a human in need of inhibition of
