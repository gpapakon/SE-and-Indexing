<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for determining whether 
electrical signals in a heart are caused by atrial depolarizations 

or ventricular depolarizations. When heart signals are 
sensed in the upper part of the ventricular heart tissue, 

preferably the upper part of the ventricular septum (10), the 
detection of heart signals from both the atrium and ventricle 

and identification of depolarization is facilitated if the 
course of the signals is sensed, whereby monophasic heart 

signals are caused by an atrial depolarization and biphasic 
signals are caused by a ventricular depolarization.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device for sensing electrical
signals in the ventricular heart tissue and distinguishing
sensed electrical signals caused by atrial depolarizations from
sensed electrical signals caused by ventricular depolarizations.In a healthy heart, a heart beat commences with a spontaneously
generated electrical impulse in the sinus node. The impulse
first induces atrial depolarization resulting in contraction of
atrial heart muscle (atrial systole). The contraction of atrial
musculature pumps blood from the respective atrium down to the
ventricles. After a delay, the impulse is then conducted to the
ventricles via the A-V node and causes ventricular depolarization,
resulting in a contraction of ventricular heart muscle
(ventricular systole). The contraction of ventricular muscle
expels blood out of the heart into the systemic circulation and
the pulmonary circulation. Heart tissue in the atrium and ventricle
then repolarizes in turn, and the muscle tissue relaxes
(diastole). The heart then refills with blood from the veins.
As the sinus node generates a new impulse, the cycle restarts. For people with certain heart defects, a pacemaker can be an
excellent aid which is capable of taking over stimulation of
heart tissue when natural, spontaneous self-stimulation is
inoperative. When e.g. the A-V node blocks transmission of
signals from the atria but the sinus node works properly, triggering
atrial depolarization in a natural way, a pacemaker
capable of stimulating ventricular heart tissue, so the stimulated
heart cycle resembles a healthy heart's cardiac cycle as
closely as possible, would be advantageous.In order to acieve this, it must be possible to detect atrial
depolarizations at the same time as it must be possible to
deliver stimulation pulses to the ventricular tissue. Here, the
use of dual chamber pacemakers, in which a first electrode with
an electrode surface is placed in the right atrium to sense
atrial depolarizations and a second electrode with an electrode
surface is placed in the apex of the right ventricle to stimulate
the ventricular tissue, is known. One such pacemaker is
described in US-A-4,343,311. At least two electrodes must be
introduced into the heart, making the system more complex.
Complications can develop during the implantation of the electrodes,
and there is an increased risk of faults. In addition,
a plurality of electrodes impedes the return of blood to the
heart to some extent.In order to reduce the number of electrodes which must be
introduced into the

<CLAIMS>
A device (2; 132) for determining whether electrical signals in a heart (4; 134) are
caused by an atrial depolarization or a ventricular depolarization, comprising an

indifferent electrode (14; 148), an electrode lead (6; 136) with a first electrode
surface (8, 138), the electrode lead (6; 136) being designed to be introduced into

the right ventricle and positioned with a gentle bend so the first electrode surface
(8; 138) is attachable to the upper part of the ventricular septum (10; 140), a

detector (20) for sensing electrical signals via the first electrode surface (8; 138)
and a control device (18; 152) for distinguishing atrial depolarizations from

ventricular depolarizations on the basis of electrical signals sensed by the detector
(20), which comprises means (21-24) for distinguishing between signals caused by

atrial depolarizations and signals caused by ventricular depolarizations, which
means (21-24) comprises a low-pass filter (22) for eliminating high-frequency

noise, a first comparator (23) which compares the amplitude of the filtered signal
with a first treshold value (V
POS
) and emits an output signal when the filtered
signal's amplitude exceeds the threshold value (V
POS
), and a second comparator
(24), which compares the amplitude of the filtered signal with a negative second

threshold value (V
NEG
), and emits an output signal when the filtered signal's
amplitude is less than the second threshold value (V
NEG
), whereby the control
device (18) interprets signals generating an output signal only from the first

comparator (22) as an atrial depolarization and signals generating an output signal
from both comparators (22, 23) a
s a ventricular depolarization.
A device according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the control device (18)
comprises a timer for measuring the time during which the first comparator (22)

emits an output signal, whereby a sensed heart signal which generates an output
signal from the first comparator (22) with a duration less than a predetermined

duration is interpreted as an atrial depolarization.
