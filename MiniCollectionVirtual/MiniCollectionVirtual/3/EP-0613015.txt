<ABSTRACT>
A stairstep output waveform representative of a wave form 
measured e.g. by an electro-optic voltage measuring system 

is generated in a digital computer from a bidirectional cumulative 
count of zero crossings of two electric signals generated 

by the voltage measuring system which count is incremented 
or decremented depending upon which of the two 

electrical signals is leading. Improved accuracy of the output 
signal is achieved by adjusting the stairstep waveform 

by the magnitude of the smaller of the two electrical signals, 
with the sense of the adjustment determined by the 

relative polarities of the two electrical signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates
to a method of deriving a representation of the voltage
waveform generating the field applied to the electro-optic
crystal from the two electrical signals in quadrature utilizing
a digital computer. Electro-optical systems for measuring electric voltages are
known. For instance, devices known as Pockel cells utilize
certain crystals which exhibit birefringence, that is a difference
in the index of refraction in two orthogonal planes,
in the presence of an electric field. Some of these crystals,
such as, for example, KDP (potassium dihydrogen phosphate),
have a fourfold axis of rotary inversion. Such materials
have the property that in the absence of an electric
field the index of refraction for light propagating along
the fourfold axis is independent of the plane of polarization
of the light. However, if an electric field is applied
parallel to the direction of the light, the index of refraction
for light polarized in one direction transverse to the
fourfold axis, known as the fast axis increases and that in
an orthogonal direction, also transverse to the fourfold
axis, and known as the slow axis, decreases by an amount
which is proportional to the strength of the electric field.
In such Pockel cell devices, if light is polarized in a
plane which forms an angle to these transverse axes, the
component of the polarized light in the direction of the
slow axis with the decreased index of refraction is retarded
with respect to the other component. If the crystal is aligned
with its fourfold axis extending between the objects
between which the voltage is to be measured, and the polarized
light is directed parallel to the fourfold axis, the total
retardation will be proportional to the total voltage
differential between the two objects. This retardation is
typically measured in wavelengths. The retardation is detected
in an analyzer and converted to an electrical signal for
producing an output representative of the magnitude of the
voltage generating the field. Due to the cylic nature of
this electrical signal, the output is only unambiguous for
voltages producing a retardation which is less than the half
wave voltage for the crystal. In KDP, this half wave voltage 
is about 11300 volts. This type of device is therefore not
suitable for measuring transmission line voltages which can
be 100,000 volts rms and more.Other types of crystals used in Pockel cells respond to an
electric field in a direction perpendicular to the direction
of propagation of light through the cell. Such cells only

A method of constructing a waveform signal (V0) representative
of an original waveform (VI), which has been resolved

into first and second bipolar electrical waveform
signals (e1, e2) substantially in quadrature and having

substantially constant and equal peak magnitudes, comprising
the steps of:


a) determining zero crossings of said first and second
electrical signals (e1, e2);
b) accumulating a cumulative count (n) of said zero crossings,
with the direction of counting being determined

by which of said first and second electrical signals
(e1, e2) is leading;
c) freezing and unfreezing said cumulative count (n) of
zero crossings in response to the magnitude of a data

sample; and
d) generating an output signal representative of the original
waveform (VI) from said cumulative count (n) of

zero crossings;

characterized by the steps of

e) periodically generating data samples representative of
the instantaneous value of said first and second

electrical signals (e1, e2);
f) achieving the cumulative count (n) by a bidirectional
cumulative count (n);
g) freezing said cumulative count (n) of zero crossings
when the magnitude of the current data sample of either

of said electrical signals falls within a band
(89, 91; 89', 91') representative of a magnitude less

than a preselected value; and 
h) unfreezing said cumulative count (n) of zero crossings
in response to the magnitude of the current data

sample of either of said electrical signals (e1, e2)
exiting said band (89, 91; 89', 91') and indexing the

cumulative count (n) in response thereto, but only
when the electrical signal which exits the band (89,

91; 89', 91'), exits with a polarity which is opposite
the polarity of that electrical signal when it entered

the band.
The method of claim 1 wherein the rate at which said data
samples are generated is such that the data sample from

only one electrical signal (e1, e2) at a time can be
within said band (89, 91; 89', 91').
The method of claim 1 wherein said band (89, 91; 89',
91') is representative of a magnitude less than a preselected

first value (89, 91) when freezing said cumulative
count (n) and is representative of a magnitude less than

a preselected second value (89', 91') which is greater
than said preselected first value (89, 91) when

unfreezing said cumulative count (n).
The method of claim 2 including adjusting the magnitude
of the output signal generated from said cumulative count

(n) of zero crossings by the magnitude of the current data
sample of a selected one of said electrical signals

(e1, e2).
The method of claim 4 wherein the magnitude of the output
signal generated from said cumulative count (n) of zero

crossings is adjusted by the magnitude of the current 
data sample of the electrical signal (e1, e2) which is

currently smaller in magnitude.
The method of claim 5 wherein the magnitude of the output
signal generated from said cumulative count (n) of zero

crossings is adjusted by the magnitude of the data sample
of the electrical signal (e1, e2) which is smaller in

magnitude applied in a sense which is determined by the
relative polarities of the current data samples of the

electrical signals (e1, e2).
The method of claim 6 including:

a) freezing the cumulative count (n) of zero crossings
when the magnitude of the current data sample of either

of said electrical signals (e1, e2) falls within a
band (89, 91; 89', 91') representative of a magnitude

less than a preselected value;
b) reversing the sense of adjusting the magnitude of the
output signal by the magnitude of the smaller electrical

signal (e1, e2) when the smaller electrical signal
makes a zero crossing while said cumulative count (n)

is frozen; and
c) unfreezing said cumulative count (n) in response to
the magnitude of the current data sample of either of

said electrical signal (e1, e2) exiting the band (89,
91; 89', 91'), and indexing the cumulative count (n)

in response thereto, but only when the electrical signal
which exits the band (89, 91; 89', 91'), exits the

band from the side opposite to that at which it
entered.
