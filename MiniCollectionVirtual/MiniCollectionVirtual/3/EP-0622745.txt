<ABSTRACT>
A character image encod/decoding apparatus is provided 

with an encoder for encoding character data to a sub-picture 
with a bit-mapped shape of monochromic character data, 

separately from an encoding of a main picture, a detecdtor 
for detecting bit changing positions in a two-dimensional 

manner from the bit-mapped shape of monochromic character 
data, an extractor for extracting a contour of the character 

data and a developper for developing the character data, the 
contour and a background of the character data in three 

domains, respectively.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to an 
encoding/decoding system and more particularly, to a 
character image encoding/decoding apparatus. In a conventional method for encoding a main picture 
comprised of video image data and a sub-picture comprised of 
only character information, such as captions superimposed on 
movie films, lyrics displayed on visual "karaoke" systems, 
telops displayed on TV screens, there is a method of encoding 
such a sub-picture comprised of the character data after 
superimposing it onto such a main picture comprised of the 
video image data. This encoding method has the feature that no special 
operation or circuit is required for displaying characters in 
a decoding operation, no restriction exists for the shape or 
the size of characters, and it is possible to add decorations 
or other characters such as kana letters on or around the 
characters. However, there is a problem that,in a low 
bit rate motion picture compression with a high data 
compression rate, deformations of the characters become 
conspicuous so that small-size characters become difficult to 
read. Furthermore, there is another problem that,if 
it is tried to reduce these deformations, the efficiency of 
the data compression deteriorates.  Further, there is another encoding method which encodes 
such a sub-picture using a code data format such as a format 
regulated by the Japanese Industrial Standard, separately 
from a main picture data. This encoding method has the feature 
that no deformation occurs in a decoded character, even when 
an image compression process has been adapted to the 
character. However there still exists a problem that a 
character generator would become necessary for displaying 
characters in its decoding operation, and furthermore a 
process of superimposing the sub-picture onto a main 
picture and a process of synchronizing them with each 
other have to be performed. In addition, there is a problem 
that the shape and size of the character are not 
flexible, or it is not possible to display charactere that 
couldn't be generated by a character generator. As described above, according to a conventional encoding 
system for a character image encoding/decoding apparatus, a 
method of encoding such a sub-picture comprised of the 
character data after superimposing it onto such a main 
picture comprised of the video image data is utilized. 
However, the conventional method has a defect such that 
deformations of the characters become conspicuous so that 
small-size characters
