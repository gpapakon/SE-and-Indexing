<ABSTRACT>
The severed end of a continuous, traveling web (11), such as paper, being wound into a wound web roll (12) is attached to the web roll, without requiring human touch, by a pair of adhesive applicators (23, 24) which are mounted on guides (19, 29) to travel longitudinally parallel with the axis of the roll being wound. The applicators may apply either a stripe of glue (21, 22) or an adhesive tape to the circumference of the wound paper roll during the last revolution of the wound web roll, preferably at two locations intermediate the end arm supports (13, 14) of the wound web roll. The applicators are moved radially inwardly to a working position and outwardly to a stand-by position relative to the axis of the rotation of the wound web roll so as to be retracted in the stand-by position when the last wrap of the web on the roll is made to attach the severed end of the web onto the finished wound web roll.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the continuous formation of successive 
wound web rolls, such as paper, of a predetermined diameter from a 
traveling, substantially continuous web. More particularly, this invention 
relates to apparatus for applying an adhesive to an area of the web slightly 
downstream of where the web has been, or will be, severed to provide the 
length of web to produce the desired diameter of the wound web roll. Still 
more particularly, this invention relates to apparatus for automatically 
applying either a stripe of glue, or an adhesive tape, circumferentially about 
the peripheral surface of the wound web roll to attach the last wrap of the 
web about the finished wound roll. The apparatus for accomplishing this 
task operates without human intervention. In prior machines for winding a traveling web into a finished wound 
roll, the trailing severed end of the web is typically attached to the wound 
roll by manually applying one or more spots of glue, or a length of adhesive 
tape which might be either two-sided, or one-sided, and applied either 
beneath the last layer of web or against the outer edge of the severed web. 
Applicators for applying either glue or tape manually in this manner are 
commercially available.  
 Each of these methods required a human operator to physically get 
close to the machinery to be exposed to the dangers inherent in being close 
to moving mechanical apparatus. The application of an adhesive to the 
wound roll to seal the finished wound roll necessarily involves undesirable 
variation in both the quantity of the adhesive applied, and the location of 
the adhesive, both of which detract from the desired uniformity and quality 
of the finished roll product. It is also conceivable to use means, such as staples, which cling to 
the outer layers of the web and are pressed into the wound roll to secure 
the last web layer to the roll. An advantage of this invention is that it provides apparatus for 
uniformly applying an adhesive to the web near the end of the winding of a 
finished wound roll (such as, for example, the second to last turn of the 
web) to adhere the trailing portion of the web to the wound web roll. All 
this can be accomplished without requiring a human to come close to the 
moving machinery and rotating wound web roll, and without requiring the 
roll being wound to be stopped to have the trailing web attached. In a document identified as "2244 Research Disclosure", No. 249, 
Great Britain, January 1985, 
there is described a winding machine
