<ABSTRACT>
A drying control system and method for obtaining a substantially 
uniformly dried low moisture content web efficiently with reduced energy 

usage in a papermaking process is provided. The drying rate of the web 
in this process is precisely controlled by detecting and monitoring the web 

or felt low and high cross-direction temperature profiles and then actuating 
drying rate modulators as required to increase or decrease the drying rate 

to produce a substantially flat temperature profile in response to 
temperature profile information provided to an automatically or manually 

controlled central control system by web high temperature and low 
temperature sensors.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to papermaking drying 
processes and apparatus for producing paper with a low moisture content 
and specifically to a control system and process for drying paper which 
controls the dryer profile by sensing the temperature profile of the paper 
web during the papermaking process. Some papermaking processes require the drying of the paper web 
being formed to under three per cent (3 %) moisture content at one or more 
points in the process. The manufacture of paper and paperboard which 
must be dried to less than 3 % moisture content has been accompanied by 
chronic problems which have adversely affected the efficiency and 
increased the cost of producing the paper product. Drying a paper or 
paperboard web to a moisture content of less than 3 % requires a high 
energy input. Heretofore, it was difficult to control drying of a paper or 
paperboard web to less than 3 % moisture in such a way that untoward 
effects could be avoided, so that the quality of the paper product has not 
always been consistent or predictable. The present invention effectively 
controls the drying of a paper web to less than 3 % moisture so that energy 
usage is reduced and the quality of the final product is significantly 
improved. During the papermaking drying process a non-uniform drying stress 
distribution may develop in both the sheet plane direction and in the 
thickness direction because of non-uniformity in the hydro-thermal and  
 
mechanical properties produced in the wire and press sections of the 
papermaking apparatus and because of the non-uniform moisture and 
temperature history during drying. Curl, wrinkle, cockle and other results 
of dimensional instability in the paper drying process are likely to be 
produced in the finished sheet. It has been recognized that the distribution 
of drying stress can be altered by exposing the paper web to different 
drying conditions or "histories" on the top and bottom sides in the after-dryer 
section of the papermaking process. Although curl shape at the reel 
can be affected somewhat by this type of differential drying, the basic 
dimensional instabilities created in a moving paper web by non-uniform 
drying stress have not been eliminated from the final product. Nari et al 
recognized the critical nature of and demand for dimensional stability in a 
wide variety of paper types and investigated the relationship between the 
hygroexpansion coefficient and drying shrinkage in papers made form 
mechanical pulps in Tappi Journal, Vol.
