<ABSTRACT>
An absorption material is described which is 
suitable for use in or in addition to a cleansing 

composition. The absorption material consists of at least 
two types of wood, at least one of the types of wood having 

a particle size of 0.1-0.2 mm. Because the types of wood 
have been subjected to a rubbing and/or pressing treatment, 

the absorptive power of the absorption material is 
increased, which has a beneficial effect on the use of the 

absorption material in or in addition to cleansing agents, 
preferably textile cleansing agents such as, for example, a 

carpet cleansing agent. In addition, a method is described 
for preparing the absorption material, as well as a method 

for using the absorption material in or in addition to a 
cleansing composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an absorption 
material, suitable for use in or with a cleansing 
composition, in particular a textile cleansing agent, at 
least comprising a finely dispersed wood material. Such an absorption material is disclosed by the 
European Application EP-A-0 178 566. Herein a powdery 
carpet cleansing agent is described which mainly consists 
of cellulose powder, organic solvent and water. The 
absorption material, cellulose powder, here generally has a 
very small particle size and is prepared from beech wood. The very small particle size of the cellulose 
powder according to EP-A-0 178 566 often makes it difficult 
to remove the powder. In addition, the absorptive effect of 
the cellulose powder is found to be not entirely 
satisfactory, so that there is still a need for an 
absorption material having a better absorptive effect. The object of the present invention is to overcome 
the abovementioned drawbacks, to which end the invention is 
characterized in that the wood material originates from at 
least two types of wood and comprises sawdust, wood fibres 
or wood flour, and in that the wood material has been 
selected by screening to a mean particle size of 0.1-0.2 mm 
for at least one of the types of wood. The use of such a wood material which comprises two 
types of wood, one of which has the abovementioned specific 
particle size, provides an absorption effect which is 
better than the absorption effect of known absorption 
agents. Furthermore, the particle size of the absorption 
material according to the invention is such that the 
particles can readily be removed after use. Expediently, the wood material of at least one of 
the types of wood has a mean particle size of 0.15-0.20 mm. Preferably, the wood material of at least one of  
 
the types of wood has a mean particle size of 0.18-0.19 mm. Expediently, the mean particle size of the other 
type(s) of wood is 0.1 - 0.8 mm. Preferably, the finely dispersed wood material 
originates from Norway spruce and pine wood. These types of wood provide an absorption material 
which shows a very good absorptive effect with the 
abovementioned specific particle sizes of the types of 
wood. In a very advantageous embodiment, the screened 
wood material has been subjected to a rubbing or pressing 
treatment. By subjecting the wood material to the 
abovementioned treatment, the particles are, as is were, 
compressed so that in use they are able to swell to a 
greater extent and are able to absorb a relatively large 
amount of
