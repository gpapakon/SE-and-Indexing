<ABSTRACT>
A process for the preparation of a polyoxymethylene 
terpolymer having a high degree of polymerization and improved 

heat stability comprises copolymerizing trioxane as a 
principal monomer with a cyclic ether or cyclic formal as a 

comonomer and a polyfunctional glycidyl compound having at 
least two epoxy groups in its molecule as a third component in 

the presence of boron trifluoride or a coordination compound 
thereof as a catalyst, the total amount of the impurities 

causative of the formation of unstable ends contained in the 
reaction system being regulated to 1 x 10⁻² mole % or below 

based on the whole amount of the monomers; the catalyst for 
the copolymerization being used in an amount of 1 x 10⁻³ to 

1 x 10⁻² mole % based on the whole amount of the monomers; 
and the copolymerization being followed by the cooling of the 

product to a temperature of 45°C or below within 30 seconds to 
deactivate the catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of a
polyoxymethylene terpolymer having a high degree of
polymerization and improved heat stability. More
particularly, it relates to a process for the preparation of a
polyoxymethylene terpolymer which has a high degree of
polymerization and an improved heat stability and contains an
extremely small amount of unstable ends. The process of the
invention employs specific polymerization conditions and a
specific treatment for the deactivation of a catalyst in the
cationic copolymerization of trioxane, a cyclic ether or
cyclic acetal and a polyfunctional glycidyl compound having at
least two epoxy groups in its molecule.Polyoxymethylene copolymers have been known for a long time as
engineering plastic materials. A method for the production of
polyoxymethylene (also referred to herein as POM) generally
comprises using a cyclic acetal such as trioxane as a
principle monomer and a cyclic acetal or a cyclic ether having
adjacent carbon atoms as a comonomer, further adding a chain
transfer agent for controlling the degree of polymerization
depending on the purpose, copolymerizing these monomers with
the use of a cation-active catalyst and then bringing the
polymerization product into contact with a catalyst
neutralizing or deactivating agent or a solution thereof to
thereby deactivate the same.In general, a considerably large amount of unstable ends are
present in a crude POM copolymer after the completion of the
copolymerization. In order to apply this crude POM copolymer 
to practical purposes, it is therefore necessary to stabilize
it by removing its unstable parts, which requires complicated
post-treatments consuming much energy, thus resulting in an
economic disadvantage. A crude POM copolymer containing a
small amount of unstable parts after the completion of the
copolymerization brings about advantages such that the final
product has an improved stability and that post-treatments
such as stabilization can be simplified. Accordingly it has
been required to develop a polymerization process whereby a
polymer with a small amount of unstable parts can be
obtained. To satisfy this requirement, attempts have been
made to develop a process for preparing a crude copolymer
containing a small amount of unstable ends. For example, it
is believed that it is preferable to effect polymerization
while minimizing the active impurities in the polymerization
system, though there is a limit to this method. There has
been also proposed a method of conducting
