<ABSTRACT>
A mid-roof anchoring system includes a series of 
anchoring channels (40) secured to the roof structure along a line (L) 

midway between the eave (E) and the ridge (R) of the roof. Metal roof 
panels (24) installed over the substructure are permitted to float 

laterally on the roof, except where they are attached to the 
anchoring channels. As a result, the roof panels expand or 

contract in both directions away from the midway line. This 
approach minimizes thermally induced movement the upper and 

lower edges of the roof, and minimizes reaction forces at the 
anchor.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a roof according to the
introductory part of claim 1.When designing a metal roof, one has to allow for thermal
expansion, since roof temperature can vary substantially, during
the course of a year, from the coldest annual temperature for
the locale to a temperature well above (because of radiant
heating by the sun) the highest annual temperature. Linear
growth of a particular roof span is proportional to span length,
so expansion problems become more acute as the roof size
increases.For a metal roof of modest size, the roof covering may be
affixed to the substructure along one edge thereof, for example
along the eave, and allowed to shrink or grow elsewhere. The
roof may be secured to the substructure, other than at the fixed
edge, by clips which permit sliding movement between the
covering and the substructure. Butler Manufacturing's MR-24
clips, for example, permit two and one-half inches of movement,
i.e., one and a quarter inches either way from a neutral
position. The upper edges of the roof move with respect to the
roof ridge line as the roof expands and contracts. The ridge is
covered by a ridge cap, which may comprise a U-shaped element
which can bend to accommodate roof expansion. Flexible weather
seals may be provided at the interface.For large roof spans (that is, continuous panel runs not
interrupted by thermal expansion joints) in the order of 60,06
to 91,44 meters (200 to 300 feet), depending on the geographic
location, movement of the free edge of the roof may exceed the
design limits of the attachment clips. One way to overcome this
problem is to break the roof span into two separate spans having
a step or lap joint, like very large shingles. The uppermost
span is secured along the step, and expands toward the roof
ridge line, and the lowermost span is affixed along the eave.
Where the spans overlap, the lower span slides or "floats"
beneath the other.A problem with stepped roofs is that of weather sealing, 
particularly leak prevention, at the lap joints. While
excellent weather seals exist, it would be simpler, cheaper and
better to be able to provide a large roof with long continuous
spans, so that steps were not required.As shown in Figure 1., a typical metal building includes an
array of vertical members 10, interconnected by substantially
horizontal beams 12, and supporting a roof substructure 14. The
roof substructure includes a series of parallel main frames or
trusses 16, or their functional equivalent, each running from
the roof ridge 18 to an eave 20.

<CLAIMS>
Roof comprising a substructure (14) formed from an array of
structural members, a metal roof covering composed of

interconnected metal panels (24), said covering being
subject to thermal expansion in at least one direction and

affixing means for immovably affixing said roof covering to
said substructure, characterised in that the roof covering

is affixed by said affixing means only within a zone (Z)
which is a narrow area on either side of a line (L)

extending intermediate two non-intersecting edges (R,E) of
the roof span.
Roof according to claim 1 characterised in that the line
(L) is parallel to at least one edge of the roof.
Roof according to claim 1 characterised in that the line
(L) is parallel to two edges of the roof.
Roof according to claim 3 characterised in that the line
(L) is approximately midway between said two edges.
Roof according to claim 4 characterised in that the roof is
sloped and has a ridge (R), one of said edges is an eave

(E) of the roof, and one of said edges runs along said
ridge.
Roof according to claim 5 characterised in that it
comprises a ridge cap (52) covering said ridge and

overlapping one edge of the roof covering.
Roof according to claim 1 characterised in that said
affixing means comprises a series of anchoring channels

(40) secured fast to the substructure within said zone (Z),
and further comprising means for attaching the roof

covering to said anchoring channels.
Roof according to claim 7 characterised in that said roof
covering is corrugated, having corrugations running between

said two edges (R,E), and each of said anchoring channels
(40) is situated below and within a respect one of said 

corrugations.
Roof according to claim 8 characterised in that each of
said anchoring channels is fastened to its respective

corrugation, the roof covering otherwise being free to
float, as it expands and contracts, on the plane of the

roof.
Roof according to claim 9 characterised in that outside of

said zone (Z), the roof covering is secured to the
substructure by clips (30) which permit sliding movement

between the substructure and the covering, but prevent the
covering from being lifted by wind.
Method of securing a metal roof covering to a roof
substructure characterised by immovably fixing the roof

covering to the substructure only within a zone (Z) which
is a small area on either side of a line (L) extending

intermediate two non-intersecting edges (R,E) of the roof
in such a way as to minimise thermally induced movement of

the covering.
Method according to claim 11 characterised in that the
line (L) is parallel to at least one edge of the roof.
Method according to claim 11 characterised in that the
line (L) is parallel to two edges of the roof.
Method according to claim 13 characterised in that the
line (L) is approximately midway between said two edges.
Method according to claim 14 characterised in that the
roof is sloped and has a ridge (R), one of said edges is an

eave (E) of the roof, and one of said edges runs along said
ridge.
