<DESCRIPTION>
The field of the invention is in a two-level infrared bolometer array 
based on a pitless microbridge detector structure with integrated circuitry on a 
silicon substrate beneath. This invention is directed to a pixel size sensor of an array of sensors 
for an infrared pitless microbridge construction of high fill factor. In this 
invention the large fill factor (>75%) is made possible by placing the detector 
microbridge on a second plane above the silicon surface carrying the integrated 
diode and bus lines. Prior art microbridge thermal detector arrays in a silicon substrate have 
been fabricated and one such example is shown in the US patent 3,801,949. In 
this prior art reference, the small pixels have a low fill factor because the 
detector, the bus lines and the diode are all in the same plane, each using a 
substantial share of the available pixel area. Figure 1 is a cross-sectional view of the two-level detector. Figure 2 is an elevation view of the two-level detector. Figure 3 is a plan view of the top plane of the detector. Figure 3a shows adjoining detectors. Figure 4 is a schematic representation of a pixel circuit and 
connections. Figure 5 and 6 show perspective and top views of an array of the 
two-level detectors. The elevation and/or cross section view of the two-level pitless 
microbridge bolometer pixel 10 is shown in Figure 1. The device 10 has two 
levels, an elevated microbridge detector 11 and lower level 12. The lower 
level has a flat surfaced semiconductor substrate 13, such as single crystal  
 
silicon substrate. The surface 14 of the silicon substrate 13 has fabricated 
thereon several components of an integrated circuit 15 including diodes, x and 
y bus lines, connections, and contact pads at the ends of the x and y bus lines, 
the fabrication following conventional silicon IC technology. The integrated 
circuit 15 is coated with a protective layer of silicon nitride 16. A top plan 
view of the lower level is shown in Figure 2 and comprises a y-diode metal 
(via) and an x-diode metal (via), chrome-gold-chrome x and y bus lines, a y-side 
bus conductor contact 18, an x-side contact 19, and the silicon nitride 
protective layer. The valley strip 17 is the area not covered by the elevated 
detector. Referring again to Figure 1, the elevated detector level 11 includes a 
silicon nitride layer 20, a serpentine metallic resistive layer 21, such as of 
nickel-iron, often called permalloy, a silicon nitride layer 22 over the layers 20 
and 21, and an IR absorber coating 23 over
