<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus capable of being sucked 
to a surface and moving along the same comprises 

a pressure receiving body, a partition device 
mounted on the pressure receiving body 

for cooperating with the pressure receiving body 
and the surface to define a pressure reducing 

space, and a pressure reducing device for discharging 
a fluid from the pressure reducing 

space to reduce a pressure in the pressure reducing 
space. The partition device includes a 

lip portion extending along the surface. Provided 
on a portion, except for an outer peripheral 

portion on an opposed surface of the lip 
portion, of the partition device positioned to be 

opposed to the surface are a plurality of abutting 
means which are spaced from one another. 

The outer peripheral portion on the opposed surface 
of the lip portion is brought into contact 

with the surface, and the abutting means on the 
portion except for the outer peripheral portion 

on the opposed surface of the lip portion are 
brought into contact with the surface, so that 

a gap communicating to the pressure reducing 
space is left between the portion, except for the 

outer peripheral portion on the opposed surface 
of the lip portion, and the surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device which 
can adhere by suction to a surface of a ship, an oil 
reservoir tank or a building, and move along the 
surface, thereby to perform work such as cleaning, 
painting or testing. Typical examples of a device which can 
suction-adhere to a vertical or inclined surface and 
move along it are those disclosed in the 
specification and drawings each of U.S. Pat. Nos. 
4,095,378, 4,926,957 and 4,934,475. Such a device has a pressure receiver, a 
partitioning means mounted on the pressure receiver 
and defining a pressure reduction space in 
cooperation with the pressure receiver and a surface, 
and a pressure reducing means for discharging a fluid 
from the pressure reduction space to decrease the 
pressure inside the pressure reduction space. The 
partitioning means is constructed such that its part 
to be contacted with the surface is displaceable by a 
relatively small force toward and away from the 
surface. Fig. 5-C of U.S. Pat. No. 4,926,957 
discloses a partitioning means of a structure 
comprising a lip portion allowed to extend along a 
surface, an extension further extending obliquely 
from a front end of the lip portion in a direction 
away from the surface, and an inside connecting 
portion and an outside connecting portion connecting  
 
the inner peripheral edge portion of the lip portion 
to a pressure receiver, the lip portion, extension 
and both connecting portions being integrally formed 
of a flexible material such as synthetic rubber. In 
such a partitioning means, the lip portion is brought 
into contact with the surface, and it is moved toward 
and away from the surface by the elastic deformation 
of the inside connecting portion and the outside 
connecting portion. If a bulge such as a weld line 
is present on the surface, the extension and the lip 
portion ride over the bulge under the guiding action 
of the extension. Thus, the partitioning means can 
pass over the bulge smoothly and move, without posing 
a problem such as the inward folding of the lip 
portion. The above-mentioned partitioning means of a 
structure including a lip portion allowed to extend 
along a surface has been demonstrated to surpass a 
partitioning means of other structure in terms of 
various properties including the bulge-passing 
properties. However, the conventional partitioning 
means including a lip portion allowed to extend along 
a surface involves problems to be solved. For 
instance, in case the surface to which the device is 
caused to suction-adhere is a
