<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a bifilar coil construction.British patents GB 1520030 and GB 1600987 describe
signal separating devices which act to isolate the d.c.
power supply circuit for the heating element of an
electrically heated motor vehicle window from the antenna
circuit of a radio receiver or transmitter connected to the
heating element, so that the heating element can be used
simultaneously for heating purposes and as a radio
transmitting or receiving antenna.The described devices use a bifilar coil for signal
separation purposes. The two windings of the coil are
connected respectively between opposite ends of the heating
element and positive and negative terminals of the d.c.
power supply circuit, whereby the coil can present a high
blocking impedance to radio signals with a low resistance
for d.c. currents. Signal separation can therefore be
effected in a particularly convenient and efficient manner.Conventionally, bifilar coils are manufactured by
machine-winding two side-by-side wires together around a
former. This results in two windings which are wound in a
common direction, which have a common diameter and axial
length, and the turns of which lie axially next to each
other. For signal separation purposes as mentioned above, 
the windings are enclosed within a pot core structure
(ferrous ceramic structure) with ends of the windings
projecting axially downwardly through openings in the
structure for connection purposes.Present trends are towards the use of higher current
consumption motor vehicle window heating elements, say
30 amps or more, and there is therefore a requirement for
bifilar coils with thicker gauge windings. However, with
the above mentioned conventional construction, thicker gauge
windings result in increased axial bulk which is
undesirable. An axially compact construction is desirable
to permit easy mounting at a required position close to the
motor vehicle window so as to minimise tuning problems due
to lead inductance and capacitance. Also, with the
conventional construction, the projecting connection ends of
the windings follow a curved or bent path where they feed
into the adjacent end turns and, in the case of axially
side-by-side thicker gauge wires this adds considerably to
the axial bulk and also can be difficult to achieve or
control with conventional winding equipment.An object of the present invention is to provide a
bifilar coil construction which can be easily and
conveniently manufactured, and with which axial bulk can be
minimised, even with thicker gauge
