<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a process for producing bulked synthetic multifilament yarn comprising a plurality of continuous synthetic filaments having deposited thereon at intermittent intervals an adhesive polymer component having a melting temperature below that of the continuous synthetic filaments. The process comprises texturizing synthetic multifilament yarn to obtain desired bulk characteristics by directing heated yarn in a current of heated fluid against a yarn plug contained in a texturizing chamber, applying said ahdesive polymer component in a molten condition to the surface of said yarn plug, and continuously discharging texturized yarn from said texturizing chamber at a lower linear rate than the feed rate of said yarn to said texturizing zone while said adhesive polymer component is still in a molten but solidifying state, resulting in bulked synthetic multifilament yarn having the adhesive polymer component deposited thereon at intermittent intervals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 MULTIFIIAMENT YARN WITH ADHESIVE POLYMER COMPONENT1. Field of the InventionThe invention relates to synthetic multifilament yarn for carpet face fiber having deposited thereon intermittent amounts of a heat-activated adhesive polymer with a melting point substantially below that of the multifilament yarn, a process for texturizing the yarn which includes application of the heat-activated adhesive to the multifilament yarn, and the process for production of carpet comprising exposure of the textured multifilament yarn having deposited thereon the intermittent amounts of heat-activated adhesive to usual process conditions for twist setting the yarn which cause the heat-activated adhesive polymer to melt substantially completely and to flow to points of intersecting filaments of the yarn to create a bond upon subsequent cooling, thus altering aesthetic properties and performance of the resulting carpet product.2. Description of the Related ArtIt has been known to blend non-adhesive fibers with potentially adhesive fibers to form a yarn or other textile structure, then to activate the potentially adhesive fibers to bond them to contacting fibers, thus modifying end-use properties of the yarn. U.S. Patent 2,252,999 to Wallach, issued August 19, 1941, provides a process wherein a yarn comprising an admixture of non-adhesive and potentially adhesive fiber is formed, the potentially adhesive fiber is activated, and the fibers compacted while in an adhesive condition so that they adhere to each other at points of contact. U.S. Patent 3,877,214 to Van der Werf, issued April 15, 1975, discloses a twist-free yarn comprising a polyamide fiber melting under a relatively low temperature as a bonding component. U.S. Patent 3,494,819 to McAllister, issued February 

10, 1970, discloses a blend of fusible and non-fusible polyethylene terephthalate fibers incorporated into fabric, wherein the finished fabric is heated to fusion temperatures to provide improved pill resistance. U.S. Patent 3,978,267 to Selwood, issuedAugust 31, 1976 discloses a substantially twistless compact yarn comprising a proportion of potentially adhesive fiber which have been activated to bond to contacting fibers. Cut pile carpet is customarily produced from staple yarn or bulked continuous filament yarn.. Texturizing multifilament yarn by directing heated yarn in a current of heated -fluid such as steam against a yarn plug contained in a texturizing zone is known in the art.For example, U.S. Patent 3,409,956 to Longbottom et al. and U.S. Patent

 WHAT IS CLAIMED:
1. A process for producing bulked synthetic multifilament yarn comprising a plurality of continuous synthetic filaments having deposited thereon at intermittent intervals an adhesive polymer component having a melting temperature below that of the continuous synthetic filaments, said process comprising: texturizing synthetic multifilament yarn to obtain desired bulk characteristics by directing heated yarn in a current of heated fluid against a yarn plug contained in a texturizing chamber, applying said adhesive polymer component in a molten condition to the surface of said yarn plug, and continuously discharging texturized yarn from said texturizing chamber at a lower linear rate than the feed rate of said yarn to -said texturizing zone while said adhesive polymer component is still in a molten state, resulting in said bulked synthetic multifilament yarn having the adhesive polymer component deposited thereon at intermittent intervals.
2. The process of claim 1 wherein said synthetic multifilament yarn is selected from the group consisting of polyamide, polyester and polypropylene. 3. The process of claim 2 wherein said synthetic multifilament yarn is polyamide and said adhesive polymer component is a copolyamide with a melting point within the range of 110 to 170°C under ambient humidity conditions and is applied in an amount of 0.5 to 10 weight percent, based on weight of the synthetic multifilament yarn.
4. The process of claim 3 wherein said adhesive polymer component is a copolyamide of the
6/66/12 type. 5. The process of claim 3 wherein said adhesive polymer component is applied in an amount of
0.5 to 2 weight percent. 


 6. The process of claim 5 wherein said adhesive polymer component has a melting point within the range of 130 to 160°C.
7. The process of claim 6 wherein said adhesive polymer component is a copolyamide of the 6/66/12 type.
