<ABSTRACT>
A method of reducing the granularity of an 
imagewise exposed photographic silver halide colour 

negative material comprising a support bearing at 
least one photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer 

having associated therewith a dye image-forming 
coupler which method includes processing the imagewise 

exposed colour negative material to form at least one 
silver image and corresponding dye image by treatment 

in a colour developer solution containing a primary 
amino colour developing agent wherein the colour 

negative material contains a pyrazolidinone compound 
of the formula: 


or a precursor thereof in such amount that the 
granularity is reduced without any substantial change 

in dye density at the same level of exposure.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of pyrazolidinone compounds to reduce granularity of 
photographic silver halide materials and in particular 
colour negative materials. There is a constant desire to improve the quality 
of photographic colour negative materials, 
particularly colour negative films, so as to obtain 
improved properties in the images formed after 
exposure and processing. These improvements are 
desirable but not at the expense of losing some other 
desirable property. One such property is granularity or the perceived 
"graininess" of the dye image. US patent 4 859 578 describes a photographic 
colour negative recording material which contains (1) 
an image dye-forming coupler, (2) a DIR compound, (3) 
a compound which releases a water-soluble mercaptan on 
silver halide development said to be invovled in 
selective development acceleration and (4) a compound 
which releases an electron transfer agent (ETA) on 
silver halide development. (Incidentally such 
materials very often contain developer inhibitor-releasing 
compounds (usually couplers) to improve 
properties such as sharpness in the image areas in the 
vicinity of its release). The material is said to have 
improved granularity without sacrificing other 
desirable properties. The present invention does not 
use incorporated compounds (3) or (4) which, of 
course, only act in the vicinity of their release. US patent 4 526 863 describes a photographic 
colour negative recording material having a relatively 
light-insensitive silver halide, zinc oxide or 
titanium oxide layer positioned between two 
photosensitive silver halide layers which contains a  
 
compound which releases a fogging agent in the 
vicinity of silver halide development. In contrast to the above two pieces of prior art, 
it is not essential to use incorporated fogging agent- 
or ETA-releasing compounds which only act in the 
vicinity of silver halide development in the present 
invention. According to the present invention there is 
provided an invention comprising the use of a 
pyrazolidinone compound of the formula: 
 
or 
 
or a precursor thereof which releases the 
pyrazolidinone compound on treatment with an alkaline 
processing solution, to reduce the granularity of an 
imagewise exposed and processed photographic silver 
halide colour negative material comprising a support 
bearing at least one photosensitive silver halide 
emulsion layer having associated therewith a dye 
image-forming coupler and containing the 
pyrazolidinone compound in such amount
