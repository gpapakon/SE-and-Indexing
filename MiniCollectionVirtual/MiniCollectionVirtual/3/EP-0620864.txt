<ABSTRACT>
Nucleic acid probes are immobilized on polystyrene surfaces such as the wells of microtiter plates for use in solution phase nucleic acid sandwich hybridization assays, particularly those using large branched DNA amplification multimers, by: (a) cleansing the surface by washing it sequentially with a strong acid, a strong base, and water; (b) passively adsorbing a polypeptide having primary amino groups onto the cleansed surface; and (c) covalently bonding the probe to the adsorbed polypeptide via a base-stable bifunctional crosslinking agent; and (d) subjecting the surface to conditions that simulate the hybridization conditions used in the assay.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of nucleic acid hybridization assays. More specifically, it
relates to an improved method for immobilizing nucleic acid probes on polystyrene surfaces for
the purpose of removing analyte nucleic acid from solution.Commonly owned US 4,868,105 describes a solution phase nucleic acid sandwich hybrid-ization
assay in which analyte nucleic acid is first hybridized in solution to a labeling probe set
and to a capturing probe set in a first vessel. The probe-analyte complex is then transferred to
a second vessel that contains a solid-phase-immobilized probe that is complementary to a
segment of the capturing probes. The segments hybridize to the immobilized probe, thus removing
the complex from solution. Having the analyte in the form of an immobilized complex facilitates
subsequent separation steps in the assay. Ultimately, single stranded segments of the labeling
probe set are hybridized to labeled probes, thus permitting the analyte-containing complex
to be detected via a signal generated directly or indirectly from the label.Commonly owned European Patent Application (EP) 317077 discloses a variation in the
assay described in US 4,868,105 in which the signal generated by the labeled probes is amplified.
The amplification involves the use of nucleic acid multimers. These multimers are branched
polynucleotides that are constructed to have a segment that hybridizes specifically to the analyte
nucleic acid or to a nucleic acid (branched or linear) that is bound to the analyte and iterations
of a second segment that hybridize specifically to the labeled probe. In the assay employing the
multimer, the initial steps of hybridizing the analyte to label or amplifier probe sets and capturing
probe sets in a first vessel and transferring the complex to another vessel containing immobilized
nucleic acid that will hybridize to a segment of the capturing probes are followed. The multimer
is then hybridized to the immobilized complex and the labeled probes in turn hybridized to the 
second segment iterations on the multimer. Since the multimers provide a large number of sites
for label probe attachment, the signal is amplified.Commonly owned copending application US Serial No. 558,897, filed 27 July 1990, (PCT
WO92/02526) describes the preparation of large comb-type branched polynucleotide multimers
for use in the above-described solution phase assay. The combs provide greater signal
enhancement in the assays than the smaller multimers.As described in EP 317077, two types of solution phase
