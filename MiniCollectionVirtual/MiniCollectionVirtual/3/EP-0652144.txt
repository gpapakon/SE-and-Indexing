<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
wheel speed detecting apparatus and more particularly, to 
a wheel speed detecting apparatus suitable for an antiskid 
control device, which is capable of detecting wheel speed 
accurately even when setting of change gear ratio of a 
transmission mechanism or wheel radius has been changed. Generally, in an antiskid brake system for a 
motor vehicle, skid symptom is detected by comparing wheel 
speed and vehicle body speed with each other. Thus, 
various wheel speed detecting apparatuses used for the 
antiskid brake system have been so far provided. Usually, 
the wheel speed detecting apparatuses of this kind are 
constituted by wheel speed sensors and a controller. Each 
of the wheel speed sensors is fixed to a rotary shaft 
coupled with wheels and includes a geared rotor rotatable 
with the rotary shaft and a pickup sensor for detecting 
each of teeth of the rotating rotor and outputting pulse 
signals, which is provided so as to confront the rotor. 
The controller calculates wheel speed from the pulse 
signals inputted from the wheel speed sensors. An antiskid brake system for a four-wheel motor 
vehicle of rear wheel drive shown in Fig. 1 includes first 
and second wheel speed sensors S1 and S2 for outputting 
pulse signals in response to rotation of a rotary shaft 1A 
for a front left wheel FL and a rotary shaft 1B for a front  
 
right wheel FR, respectively and a third wheel speed 
sensor S3 for outputting pulse signals in response to 
rotation of a propeller shaft 2. A controller 4 calculates 
rotational angular velocities SA1 and SA2 of the rotary 
shafts 1A and 1B for the front left and right wheels FL and 
FR from the pulse signals of the first and second wheel 
speed sensors S1 and S2 and further calculates wheel speeds 
SW1 and SW2 of the front left and right wheels FL and FR 
from the rotational angular velocities SA1 and SA2 and 
radius of the front left and right wheels FL and FR (wheel 
radius). Meanwhile, the controller 4 calculates a rotational 
angular velocity SA3 of the propeller shaft 2 from 
the pulse signals of the third wheel speed sensor S3 and 
further calculates an average wheel speed of rear left and 
right wheels RL and RR (average rear wheel speed) from the 
rotational angular velocity SA3 and a conversion factor 
indicative of change gear ratio of a differential gear 5 
and wheel radius. However, change gear ratio of the differential 
gear 5 varies according to models of motor vehicles, etc. 
and thus, the conversion factor is
