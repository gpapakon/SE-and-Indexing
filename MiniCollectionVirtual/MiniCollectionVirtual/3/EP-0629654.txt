<ABSTRACT>
Plastic parts made from polyethylene, polypropylene or comparable materials are pretreated for painting by exposure to a fluorine-containing treatment gas. This treatment gas has an absolute pressure of from 333 to 400 mbar, contains 3 - 5 per cent by volume of fluorine and contains 10 - 16 per cent by volume of oxygen in addition to at least one other inert gas constituent. The exposure time of the treatment gas is from about 10 to 180 seconds. The reaction chamber is first evacuated to an absolute pressure of 200 mbar, and a gas mixture comprising 10% by volume of F2 and 90% by volume of N2 is then introduced until the absolute pressure has risen to 400 mbar. The amount of gas mixture comprising F2 and N2 flowing in per time unit is selected so that a pressure increase in the reaction chamber of between 100 mbar/min and 200 mbar/min is obtained.

<CLAIMS>
Process for pretreating paintable surfaces of dry plastic 
parts made of polyethylene or polypropylene by reaction of a 

fluorine-containing treatment gas within a closed reaction 
chamber on the plastic parts, the treatment gas containing 

oxygen in addition to an inert gas component, characterized in 
that the treatment gas has an absolute pressure of 333 to 400 

mbar, contains 3 to 5% by volume of fluorine and 10 to 16% by 
volume of oxygen in addition to at least one other inert gas 

component, in that the reaction time of the treatment gas is 
10 to 180 seconds, in that the reaction chamber is initially 

evacuated to an absolute pressure of 200 mbar and a gaseous 
mixture containing 10% by volume of F
2
 and 90% by volume of N
2
 
is then added until the absolute pressure has risen to 400 

mbar and in that the quantity of gaseous mixture consisting of 
F
2
 and N
2
 entering per unit time is selected such that a rise 
in pressure in the reaction chamber of between 100 mbar/min 

and 200 mbar/min is produced. 
Process according to claim 1, characterized in that, 
prior to the reaction of the fluorine-containing treatment 

gases, the reaction chambers filled with the plastic parts to 
be treated are evacuated to evaporate moisture on the plastic 

parts.
