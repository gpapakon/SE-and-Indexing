<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnet table 
for rotary screen printing machines and in particular a 
table comprising permanent magnets. It is known that webs of textiles and other soft 
materials wound on bobbin are printed by means of 
rotary screen printing machines. The machines of this 
kind comprise an horizontal drum which supports the 
printing screen provided with the pattern to be 
printed. The printing ink is introduced into the 
printing drum and is pushed through the printing screen 
by means of a squeegee roll which freely rotates in 
contact with the internal cylindrical surface of the 
printing screen supported by the drum during the 
rotation thereof. The material to be printed is fed 
beneath the drum by a flexibile conveyor which moves on 
a magnet table comprising a rigid transverse girder 
containing electrical magnets. The squeegee roll, made 
of ferromagnetic metal, is downwardly attracted by the 
magnet table so that the magnetic attraction causes the 
squeegee roll to "squeeze" the printing ink through the 
perforations of the printing screen, with the final 
result that the printing ink penetrates into the web of 
the material which is correspondingly printed. The use of an electromagnet in the magnet table 
for attracting the squeegee roll has the advantage that 
the attraction can be easily interrupted by simply 
interrupting the electric power. This operation is  
 
quite frequent since it is required any time the 
squeegee roll is to be replaced or the printing screen 
to be changed. The use of the electromagnets has 
however the drawback that the attraction forces are not 
enough strong to cause the squeegee roll to energically 
push the ink to penetrate into fabrics of high 
thickness. In such cases it is possible to increase the 
forces by using more powerful electromagnets of bigger 
sizes, but this solution involves room problems. 
Moreover the electromagnets require a considerable 
consumption of electric power and are subject to 
thermal expansion during the operation with consequent 
negative influence on the printing accuracy. In FR-A-1553987 there is described a magnetic table wherein a girder bearing a set of permanent 
magnets can be moved parallel to the axis of the squeegee roll in order to modify the magnetic field 
generated by the magnets. The cover of the magnetic table consists of a plate made of a non-magnetic 
alloy wherein there is inserted a plurality of discs made of magnetizable material. These 
discs allow to shunt the poles of the permanent
