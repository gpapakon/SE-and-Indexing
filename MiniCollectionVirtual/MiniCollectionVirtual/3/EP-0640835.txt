<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
determining sugar chain structures, a kit to be used for said
method and novel oligosaccharides. The present invention, in
particular, relates to a method for determining the structure
of an N-acetyllactosamine type of sugar chain, a kit to be
used for said method, and novel N-acetyllactosamine type of
sugar chains.Recently, many evidences have been presented for proving
the fact that the sugar chains perse function in the
recognition of cells, adhesion of cells or metastasis of
cancer and, therefore, the structural analysis of the sugar
chain in glycoconjugates including glycoproteins and
glycolipids is becoming more and more important. In the
prior art, the chain structure was analyzed by various
analytical methods including methylation analysis, periodate
oxidation, enzymatic digestion, nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. In addition, it has
become possible to analyze sugar chains by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), which has been rapidly
developed in recent years. A method for the fluorescence 
labeling of sugars with 2-aminopyridine has been developed by
Hase et al. [Journal of Biochemistry, 95, 197-203 (1984);
Hereinafter, this method and pyridylamino sugar will be
referred to as PA-method and PA-sugar, respectively), and the
combination of pyridylamination with HPLC using two kinds of
columns, i.e. so-called two-dimensional mapping method makes
it possible to analyze many oligosaccharides sensitively
[Analytical Biochemistry, 171, 73-90 (1988)].However, it is impossible to distinguish sugar chains
having the same elution position or elution positions which
are very close to each other in the two kinds of columns from
each other by this method. Further, this method is
ineffective for sugar chains not mentioned in the map,
particularly, for those having sialic acid residues, and it
is thus unsuitable for the determination of the structure of
a sugar chain having an unknown structure.When the structure of a sugar chain is to be determined
by a method, which combines any labeling methods with any
separation method, such as the combination of
pyridylamination with HPLC, all of the possible sugar chains
should be available for the standard sugar chains with the
structures determined by any method, and moreover, they
should be separated and identified by the separation methods,
but this must be impossible because of the diversity of sugar
chain structures. Thus, digestion with exoglycosidases with 
limited substrate
