<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention comprises unsaturated phosphonate 
derivatives of certain purines or pyrimidines useful as 
anti-viral agents, to methods and intermediates useful for 
their preparation and to their end-use application as 
antiviral agents effective against DNA viruses (herpes 
viruses 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, 
Epstein-Barr virus), retroviruses (human immunodeficiency 
viruses 1 and 2 and visna virus) and against viruses 
involved in tumor formation. Certain derivatives of purine or pyrimidine bases have 
shown antiviral and antitumor activity. For example, see EP 
0 173,624; EP 0 253,412; EP 0 353,955; WO 92/01698; EP 0 
481,214; and J.Org.Chem. 57: 2320-2327 (1992). The 
compounds of the present invention represent novel 
compounds derived from purine and pyrimidine bases. More specifically this invention relates to novel 
compounds of Formula I and Formula II:  the stereoisomeric forms and mixtures thereof, tautomeric 
forms and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, 
wherein
 
   X₁ is H or NH₂;
 
   X₂ is OH or NH₂;
 
   X₃ is H or CH₃; and
 
   X₄ is NH₂ or OH;
 
   Z is nothing, CH₂, CH₂CH₂, CH₂O, or CH₂OCH₂;
 
 
W is 
wherein each of R₁ and R₂ are independently H, F or CH₂OH;
 
   T is nothing, T' or T'', wherein
 
   T' is CH₂CH₂, CH=CH, CH₂CH(OH), CH₂CH(CH₂OH), or 
CH₂CH(CH₂F), and
 
   T'' is CH=CH-CH(OH), CH=CH-CH(CH₂OH), CH₂OCH₂, 
CH₂OCH(CH₂OH), CH₂CH(CH₂OH)CH₂, CH₂CH₂CH(OH), 
CH₂CH₂CH(CH₂OH), or CH₂CH₂CH(CH₂F);
 
provided that when T is CH=CH or CH₂CH₂, W is Wc , and Z is 
CH₂, then X₁ is not NH₂ and X₂ is not OH simultaneously; 
provided that when W is We and 
T = T'  
 then Z is nothing or 
CH₂,
 
provided that Z is nothing only when W is We, and 
provided that when T is nothing and W is Wc then Z is not 
CH₂CH₂ or CH₂OCH₂.  The present invention also comprises using the 
compounds of Formula I and Formula II to prepare a 
pharmaceutical composition for treating viral infections. The compounds of the present invention are purine 
derivatives (Formula I) or pyrimidine derivatives (Formula 
II), herein referred to as nucleic bases (dotted line 
representing the attachment to the rest of the molecule): 
having a phosphonate moiety. Linking the phosphonate moiety 
to the purine or pyrimidine derivative are moieties T, W and 
Z groups. An example of the attachment of these moieties to 
the rest of the molecule follows where T is T'' and is 
CH=CH-CH(CH₂OH), W is Wa wherein R₁ and R₂ are each H, and Z 
is CH₂O:
