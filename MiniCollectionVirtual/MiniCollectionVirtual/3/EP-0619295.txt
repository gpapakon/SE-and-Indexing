<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing N-monosubstituted acrylamides in high yields without forming by-products. The process comprises 
preparing a β-dialkylamino-(methyl)propionic ester by the reaction of a (meth)-acrylic ester with a specified dialkylamine, 

converting the formed ester into an N-monosubstituted β-dialkylamino(methyl)propionamide by the reaction thereof with a primary 
amine in the presence of sodium methoxide, and thermally decomposing the amide under a reduced pressure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an industrially-advantageous 
method of manufacturing N-monosubstituted 
(meth)acrylamides which can be used as a blending agent for 
concrete, an agent for treating water, a chemical agent for 
paper, a stabilizer for latex, etc. after being 
copolymerized with other monomers. With regard to the manufacture of N-monosubstituted 
(meth)acrylamides, a method involving reacting (meth)acrylic 
acid chloride with a primary amine in a neutralizing agent 
such as sodium hydroxide has been known. However, it is 
unlikely that said method is industrially advantageous 
because of the use of expensive materials and neutralizing 
agents and also the complexity of the operation. On the 
other hand, in accordance with the reaction of 
(meth)acrylates with amines for manufacturing 
(meth)acrylamides, it is possible to use less expensive 
materials and, therefore, several methods for the 
manufacture of N-substituted (meth)acrylamides by said 
reaction have been known. Since the double bond in the  
 
(meth)acrylates is very reactive, the common means for the 
manufacture of the desired products in that case is that a 
protecting group such as an amine, cyclopentadiene, an 
alcohol, etc. is initially added to the double bond and, 
after completion of the amidation, the protecting group is 
detached by heating. For example, the use of 
cyclopentadiene as a protecting group is disclosed in 
Examined Japanese Patent Publication (Kokoku) Sho-54/9170, 
etc. while the use of alcohols as a protective group is 
disclosed in United States Patent No. 3,914,303, etc. Further, an example of the use of amines as a 
protecting group can be found in United States Patent No. 
2,451,436 disclosing a method in which an acrylate is made 
to react with a mono- or dialkylamine and the resulting N-alkyl-beta-alkylaminopropionamide 
is subjected to thermal 
decomposition in the presence of an acid to give an N-alkylacrylamide. 
Another example is Laid-Open Japanese 
Patent Publication (Koukai) Hei-04/154749 disclosing a 
method in which N-dimethylamino-beta-dimethylaminopropionamide 
is subjected to thermal 
decomposition in a liquid phase to give dimethylacrylamide 
at a good yield. In the manufacture of N-substituted (meth)acrylamides 
using a (meth)acrylate as a starting material, the method 
using an amine as a protecting group may be industrially  
 
advantageous as compared with a method using an alcohol or 
cyclopentadiene because thermal decomposition in a liquid 
phase especially at a relatively low
