<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a single-piece carrier member (38) for assembly of a heater unit (36) for a self-heating container, e.g. a food pack. The carrier member (38) includes foldable fingers (64) for securing an annular solid fuel tablet (66) to the carrier member (38), and a sleeve in which are mounted a friction ignition head (48) and a manually operated slidable striker (46). The carrier member (38) has tabs (68) to enable the unit to be installed securely in a self-heating container. The carrier member (38) can be formed from a blank which is folded on itself to form the sleeve, the fingers (64) then folded inwardly, and the tabs (68) then folded downwardly. The carrier member (38) is made of tinplate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a heater unit for use 
in a self-heating container. In particular it relates to 
parts for a solid fuel heater unit with a manually operable 
igniter for automatically igniting the solid fuel. The unit 
is particularly suitable for use in disposable self-heating 
food containers, but is not limited to this. A food container with a built-in heater of this type is 
described in published International patent application WO-A-83/00425. The heater includes a top heat spreading layer, and a 
layer of exothermic material having internal walls and 
arranged on a heat insulating non-combustible layer. Under 
the non-combustible layer, a slidable striker is positioned 
in contact with a friction responsive element. A primer 
material is supported in the non-combustible layer between 
the friction responsive element and the exothermic material 
for initiating the exothermic reaction once the primer has 
been ignited. Such an arrangement is quite complicated and involves 
a large number of different parts. In at least some of the 
embodiments described in WO-A-83/00425, the parts are 
"stacked" loosely together in the base of the food 
container, and the design relies on at least a portion of 
the container itself to hold the heater parts together in 
the correct position. Disposable and portable food heaters are also 
described in GB-A-2158698 and US-A-5048506 respectively. In a first aspect, the present invention provides a 
heater unit for installation in a disposable self-heating 
container, the heater unit comprising solid fuel means, 
slidably activated friction-responsive igniter means, and a 
single piece carrier member produced by folding sheet material to provide 
first means for securing the solid fuel means to the carrier 
member, second means for operatively securing the igniter 
means to the carrier member in use to enable the igniter 
means to ignite the solid fuel means, and third means 
securable to a said disposable container to facilitate  
 
installation of the heater unit. Such a heater unit uses fewer parts than the prior art, 
and can be made simple to assemble. The unit is self-contained 
and does not rely on other parts of the disposable 
container to hold the solid fuel means and the igniter means 
in position. The unit can be fully assembled before 
installation in the container. The carrier member should preferably be made of a non-combustible 
material which is able to withstand the heat 
produced once the burner has been ignited. A suitable 
material

<CLAIMS>
A heater unit for installation in a disposable self-heating 
container, the heater unit comprising solid fuel 

means (36), slidably activated friction-responsive igniter means (46), 
characterized in that it comprises further 

a single piece carrier member (38) produced by folding sheet 
material to provide first means (64) for securing the solid fuel means to 

the carrier member, second means (40, 42) for operatively securing 
the igniter means to the carrier member in use to enable the 

igniter means to ignite the solid fuel means, and third 
means (68) securable to a said self-heating container to 

facilitate installation of the heater unit. 
A heater unit according to claim 1, wherein the carrier 
member is made of non-combustible material. 
A heater unit according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
first means of the carrier comprises one or more fingers (64) for 

fitting over at least a portion of the solid fuel means. 
A heater unit according to claim 3, wherein the solid 
fuel means (66) has a hole therethrough, and the first means 

finger or fingers (64) pass through the hole. 
A heater according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the 
igniter means (46) comprises an igniter strip (46) and friction 

responsive ignition material (48), the second means comprising a 
sleeve (40, 42) in which the igniter strip is slidably retained in 

contact with the friction responsive material. 
A heater unit according to claim 5, wherein the ignition 
material (48) is mounted below the igniter strip (46), and the solid 

fuel means (36, 66) is mounted above the igniter strip, in use, the 
igniter strip being slidably extractable from the passage to 

cause the ignition material to flare and ignite the solid 
fuel means. 
A heater unit according to any of claims 1 to 6, wherein  
 

the third means comprises one or more tabs (68) for engagement 
with corresponding slots in a said disposable container. 
A single piece carrier member for use in a heater unit 
as set forth in claim 1. 
A blank apt to be folded to form a carrier member 
as set forth in claim 8. 
A blank according to claim 9, the blank comprising first 
and second portions (40, 42) foldable against each other to define a 

sleeve for retaining an igniter strip, one or more foldable 
arms (63, 64) for securing a solid fuel means, and one or more 

foldable tabs (68) for enabling the carrier member to be secured 
in a disposable container.
