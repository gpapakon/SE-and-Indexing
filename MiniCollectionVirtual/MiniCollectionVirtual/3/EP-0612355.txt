<ABSTRACT>
A method of diagnosing cancers associated with the absence of the gene encoding human p58 protein, such as neuroblastomas, ductal carcinomas of the breast, malignant melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma or endocrine neoplasia is set forth. In one embodiment, cells, especially in metaphase, are prepared from a tissue to be examined. There is then performed an in situ hybridization with a labelled probe including a DNA sequence which is either complementary to the p58 protein kinase gene or to a portion of the p58 kinase gene which is long enough to identify such gene, if present. Determination of the presence of the absence of the gene on the number 1 chromosome indicates that a cell is cancerous or, at the very least, potentially cancerous. In a second embodiment, antibodies specific to p58 protein kinase are employed for its detection. Kits including a probe or antibody as discussed above are also set forth.

<DESCRIPTION>
 DETECTION OF HUMAN P58 PROTEIN KINASE AND ITS DNA FOR DIAGNOSIS OF CERTAIN CANCERSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION1. Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a method and to a kit for detecting a genetic mutation associated with a cancer and, more particularly, to a method and a kit using a labelled probe to detect a gene whose absence is associated with certain types of cancers. The invention further relates to a method and to a kit for detecting a genetic mutation associated with a cancer using a labelled antibody to detect a protein whose absence is associated with certain types of cancers.2. Background of the InventionThe ability of a cell to reproduce by cell division is one of the most fundamental processes of all living matter. Abnormalities of these processes are often involved in the growth of transformed cells. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the events involved in normal cell division is crucial to understanding transformed cell growth. To this end, several groups have identified a cell division control protein kinase gene superfamily and, in particular, the human cell division control (CDC)-related gene family which contains at least four members, including the mitotic protein kinase p34cdc2 (Lee and Nurse, 1987; Hanks, 1987; Hanks et al, 1988; Bunnell et al., 1990a; Johnson and Smith, 1991). The protein kinase p34cdc2 has been shown to be a crucial component of a normal mitotic promoting factor complex, which includes other protein components such as the cyclin regulatory subunits. In particular, the p34edc2 protein kinase has been shown to be required for both the G2- to S-phase transition in the cell cycle. A number of studies have demonstrated that the p34cdc2 protein kinase is the catalytic subunit of starfish, clam, and Xenopus oocyte maturation-promoting factor (MPF) (Arion et al., 1988; Draetta et al., 1988; Dunphy et al., 1988; Gutier et al., 1988) and its somatic cell mitotic counterpart (Draetta and Beach, 1988; Langan et al., 1989; Brizuela et al., 1989). Interaction of the p34c<ic2 kinase catalytic subunit with a cyclin regulatory subunit results in an active protein kinase complex that phosphorylates a number of cellular substrates that play important roles in regulating the physical processes of mitosis (Moreno et al, 1989; Norbury and Nurse, 1989). 

 The exact function(s) of the other members of the p34cdc2-related protein kinase gene family is unknown, but it is clear that this family of genes is much larger than first anticipated. We previously identified a
