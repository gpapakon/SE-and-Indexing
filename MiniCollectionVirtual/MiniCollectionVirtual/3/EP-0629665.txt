<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flame-retardant 
resin composition superior in low-temperature 
resistance and flame retardancy, suitably used in 
various molded articles obtained by injection molding, 
extrusion, etc. In general, thermoplastic resins are superior 
in mechanical properties, heat resistance, electrical 
properties, moldability, etc. and are in wide use in 
general industries as electrical device or apparatus 
parts, automobile parts, precision machine parts, etc. 
These thermoplastic resins, however, have a drawback of 
being burnt relatively easily and find limited applications 
in usages wherein flame retardancy is required, 
such as electronic and electrical parts (e.g. TV parts), 
parts used in automobile engine room, and the like. It 
is therefore required strongly to impart excellent flame 
retardancy to thermoplastic resins. Hence, there were made a number of proposals 
of adding various halogen compounds and phosphorus compounds. 
These proposals are not satisfactory, because 
the addition of said flame retardants imparts excellent 
flame retardancy but reduces the excellent mechanical 
properties, electrical properties and processability 
inherently possessed by thermoplastic resins. The present invention is intended to provide a  
 
flame-retardant resin composition of improved flame 
retardancy using a halogen-free flame-retardant compound, 
without inviting reduction in inherent properties 
of thermoplastic resins. The present inventors made a study on combinations 
of a thermoplastic resin and a halogen-free flame-retardant 
compound. As a result, it was found that 
simple mixing of a thermoplastic resin and a phenolic 
resin can give improvement in flame retardancy but 
invites reduction in properties such as low-temperature 
resistance, heat resistance and the like. It was also 
found that simple mixing of a thermoplastic resin and a 
phosphorus-, nitrogen- or boron-containing compound 
gives insufficient improvement in flame retardancy and 
further invites bleeding and reduction in properties 
such as low-temperature resistance, heat resistance and 
the like. The present inventors made a further study. 
As a result, it was found that a melt reaction product 
between an epoxy-modified resin [component (B) of the 
present invention] and a halogen-free flame-retardant 
compound [component (C) of the present invention] can 
cover the fragility of a phenolic resin, can improve the 
bleeding of a phosphorus-, nitrogen- or boron-containing 
compound, and can alleviate the
