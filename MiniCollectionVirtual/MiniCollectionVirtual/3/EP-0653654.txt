<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for optically interconnecting integrated circuits (202,204) that reduces 
optical path alignment difficulties and enhances signal quality. Employs one or 

more holographic optical elements (409, 601; 704) adapted for directing one or 
more modulated beams of light. Because each holographic optical element is 

individually aligned with a respective photonic device (406, 408), the apparatus is 
free from registration run off that is associated with large dimension optical 

substrates employed in previous optical interconnect schemes. Accordingly, 
optical path alignment between transmitting photonic devices and receiving 

photonic devices is preserved. 
In the preferred embodiment each hologram is integral with the respective 
photonic device, preferably by etching each hologram into a respective 

surface of the respective photonic device. Accordingly, in the preferred 
embodiment, the hologram individually aligned with the second photonic device 

(408) is integral with a receiving surface (409) of the second photonic 
device. Similarly, the hologram individually aligned with the first photonic 

device (406) is integral with an emitting surface (407) of the first photonic 
device. The hologram integral with the first photonic device (406) directs 

each of the optical paths followed by the modulated beam of light as it passes 

from the emitting surface (407) of the first photonic device. Features of 
the hologram integral first photonic device are etched into the emitting 

surface and arranged for directing the path of the beam of light at an oblique 
angle with respect to the emitting surface.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to optoelectronic apparatus, for example to
signal interconnections between integrated circuit (I.C.) chips, that is optical
interconnections of integrated circuits in multichip modules.Modules that incorporate multiple computing chips are needed to realize
advanced computers such as highly parallel computational systems that employ
next generation Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) computing chips. Such
systems require highly dense connection networks that contain many increased
length or "long distance" high speed intramodule connections. For successful
system design it is important to reduce the area, power requirements, and time
delay of these intramodule connections.For example, next generation processor arrays typically include hundreds
of chips. Given each chip containing 512 processing elements per chip, and each
processing element requiring at least one increased length connection, a
multichip module system capable of providing approximately 512 connections per
chip is needed. Accordingly, a module containing 64 chips requires over 32,000
increased length intramodule connections. Such a large number of increased
length intramodule connections can easily impede system performance unless the
area, power requirements, and time delay of these intramodule connections is
reduced.In highly parallel systems that employ only conventional electrical
connection technology, increased length intramodule electrical connections are
responsible for a large share of a total power dissipation, time delay and surface
area consumption of each system. To avoid such difficulties, intramodule
connections longer that a specified length are characterized as increased length
or "long distance" connections and are implemented using optical technology. By
replacing increased length electrical intramodule connections with optical
connections, a communications "bottle neck" is relieved. Such optical
interconnects increase communication speed and reduce the volume, cross talk
and power dissipation of increased length connections. Figure 1 is a cut away side view showing a previously known optical
interconnection scheme. As shown the scheme includes a mirror 101 and a
single contiguous large dimension holographic optical substrate 102 incorporating
transmitter holograms 104 and receiver holograms 106. The scheme further
includes Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) optical transmitter chips 108, and silicon
Integrated Circuit (IC) chips 110. As shown in figure 1, both GaAs and silicon
chips are mounted on a
