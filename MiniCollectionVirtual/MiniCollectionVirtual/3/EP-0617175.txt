<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to an electronically operated 
assembly to be used in conjunction with water faucets provided with 

sensing means that sense the presence of objects such as human hands 
and automatically start the flow of water. The water flow automatically 

stops when said object is removed from the faucet vicinity. 
According to the invention there is provided an electronically 
automated assembly for water faucets comprising a water flow control 

valve and a small size electric motor adapted to operate said valve via 
a transmission gear and an infrared sensing means (70,72) connected to a 

source 
of electric power adapted to activate or disconnect said electric motor.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electronically 
operated assembly to be used in conjunction with water 
faucets provided with sensing means that sense the 
presence of objects such as human hands and 
automatically start the flow of water. The water flow 
automatically stops when said object is removed from the 
faucet vicinity. Automatic electrical or electronically operated faucets 
have been known for many years. There are a relatively 
large number of patents relating to such devices and 
systems such as U.S. Patent No.s 4,921,211, 4,872,485, 
4,894,874 and 4,762,273; a fairly large number of other 
patents are cited in the above mentioned patents. These 
patents differ from each other by all kinds of features, 
such as the structure thereof or the operating method 
and components. Several of the above mentioned patents are based on a 
passive infra-red (thermal) receiver sensitive to the 
temperature of a nearby object, others use ultrasonic 
techniques and electro-optical mechanisms incorporating 
Light Emitting Diodes (LED's) and Si-based detectors. The present invention uses an electro-optical method and 
electro-mechanical apparatus that overcomes the 
deffiencies associated with prior art solutions:  a) All other known methods do not afford execution 
of the various tasks required in dishes cleaning basins, 
like: filling a glass, saponification of a pot without 
water flow, cleaning the basin and washing hands. b) The reflection of IR light from black objects 
is very weak. A conventional electro-optical proximity 
sensing system is thus either insensitive to black 
bodies or having a large dynamic range leading to 
susceptibility to false alarms. c) Another problem associated with prior art 
electro-optical automatic faucets is the fact that they 
are not sensitive to specular objects like a polished 
knife. d) Previous methods yield a relatively high 
percentage of false alarms, i.e. water flow activation 
due to "false" objects like a nearby hand or a pile of 
dished in the basin. e) Most prior art methods use network power to 
feed the electro-mechanical module and their design does 
not minimize power consumption. f) The mechanical part and activation mechanism 
differes from other patents in the fact that there is no 
use of a solenoid to activate the valve but by an 
electric motor and by the mechanical transmission which 
need very little energy than which is required by a 
solenoid. Furthermore, the opening for the release of pressure 
which holds the diaphragm of the main valve
