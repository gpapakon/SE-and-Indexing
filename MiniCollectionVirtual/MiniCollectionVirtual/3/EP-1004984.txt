<ABSTRACT>
The method comprises a histogram of the radiographed image, i.e., a
real histogram (step 2), a mathematical model of the image chain and the

object obtained by calibration. The mathematical model of the image chain
and the object and a set of parameters of acquisition, of the detector, of the

positioner and of the object are used to determine (step 1) two values of gray
level, gray min and gray max, delimiting a useful zone and the part below

gray min and the part above gray max are suppressed (step 3) in the real
histogram, i.e., a limited histogram. A set of rules is applied (step 4) to the

limited histogram in order to determine the level of brightness (WL) and the
contrast (WW) is obtained from the brightnes
s and possibly from one or more
parameters selected by the user or fixed a priori.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for automatic determination of the
brightness and contrast of a digitized radiographic image of an object.It finds a particularly interesting application in the medical field in
which fine analyses of radiographic images are made, notably
mammography.In the medical field, diagnoses generally are based on the study of a
radiographic image. The progress of digital systems now makes it possible to
vary the characteristics of the image in order to best effect a diagnosis. Thus,
it is evident that the quality of the image is an essential point.As is well known, image acquisition introduces numerous parameters
related to the acquisition chain: These include the parameters of acquisition
(target material of the anode of the X-ray tube [track], material and thickness
of the filter at the output of the X-ray tube [filter], voltage applied between
cathode and anode of the X-ray tube [kV], heating current of the filament of
the cathode of the X-ray tube [mA], exposure time, ...), the parameters of the
positioner (incidence of the view, enlargement factor, type of compression
pad used, thickness of the object, force of compression, ...) and the parameters
of the digital detector (relation of gray levels to flux of X-rays captured ...). In
addition to this, the parameters of the object, in particular its composition, are
introduced. This set of parameters makes it possible to obtain an image that is
in fact composed of pixels of shades of gray. Quantification of the image is
obtained on a given number of gray levels. When the image is displayed on a
screen or imprinted on a film using a given range of gray levels, the contrast
perceived may be considerably different among images of the same object
acquired with different sets of parameters of acquisition or among images of
different objects obtained with the same set of parameters. In addition,
selection of the range of gray level to be considered for the screen is of great 
importance in order to give an acceptable perception of contrast in the image.
Thus, once the image has been obtained, the user interactively modifies the
brightness (WL: window level) and the contrast (WW: window width) of this
image in order to adjust the range of gray levels in it so as to obtain a correct
perception of contrast.Generally, for more than 16000 different gray levels, it is a difficult and
lengthy task to select the correct brightness and contrast manually.An embodiment of the invention permits automatically determining
the value of the

<CLAIMS>
A method of acquisition of a digital radiographic image of an
object, having a histogram of the radiographed image (real histogram) and a

mathematical model of the image chain and the object obtained by calibration,
comprising the steps of:


a) providing the mathematical model of the image chain and the
object and of a set of parameters of acquisition, of the detector, of the

positioner and of the object, to determine two values of gray level, gray min
and gray max, delimiting a useful zone
b) suppressing the part below gray min and the part above gray
max in the histogram (limited histogram);
c) applying a set of rules to the limited histogram in order to
determine the level of brightness WL; and
d) obtaining the contrast WW from WL and possibly from one
or more parameters selected by the user or fixed a priori.
The method according to claim 1, comprising the step of
estimating a coefficient of minimum linear attenuation (µ min) of the object

from known values of the coefficient of linear attenuation of the least
attenuant tissues of the object (adipose tissues for the breast) for the energies

of the X-ray spectrum determined by the parameters of acquisition and makes
it possible, with the parameters of the detector, the parameters of the

positioner, the parameters of acquisition and the parameters of the object,
through a mathematical model of the image chain and of the object, to

determine gray min.
The method according to claim 1, comprising the step of
estimating a coefficient of maximum linear attenuation (µ max) of the object

either from known values of the coefficient of linear attenuation of the most
attenuant tissues of the object (fibrous tissue for the breast) for the energies of

the X-ray spectrum determined by the parameters of acquisition or, in a more
precise manner, from the mechanical thickness of the compressed breast, the

parameters of acquisition, the mathematical model of the image chain and the
object and from a quantity of photons obtained following a preexposure

performed on a zone of maximum density of the object, and makes it possible,
with the parameters of the detector, the parameters of the positioner, the

parameters of acquisition and the parameters of the object, to determine gray
min through a mathematical model of the image chain and the object.
The method according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein the limitation of the histogram introduces two gray levels (gray min

and gray max) surrounding a zone of gray levels within which the brightness
WL is determined.
The method according to any one of the preceding claims,
wherein a correlation is made between the limited histogram and a

mathematical model of the histogram in order to determine the value of a
radiologic thickness characterizing the object.
The method according to claim 5, wherein the correlation
between the limited histogram and the mathematical model of the histogram

is effected by applying a method of minimization of errors between two
functions.
A method of acquisition of a digital radiographic image of an
object, having an acquisition chain comprises a step of compensation for the

effect of exponential attenuation of the radiation by using a modified
logarithmic function, so that perception of the contrast (WW) of a given

difference of thickness remains invariant regardless of the means of
acquisition.
The method according to claim 7, wherein the brightness (WL)
and (WW) obtained from a coefficient of mean attenuation of the image

independently of the brightness, are introduced in a visualization step so that
the signals coming from the compensation step (space of radiologic

thicknesses) are sized in the space of real thicknesses.
