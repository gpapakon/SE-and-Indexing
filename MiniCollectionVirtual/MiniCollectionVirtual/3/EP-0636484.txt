<ABSTRACT>
A printer provided with an exposure device comprising a number of rows of LED's 
which can be energised by an energising means, in which a photosensitive element can 

be passed along the exposure device in a direction perpendicular to the rows, it being 
possible to write an image line by line on the photosensitive element by means of the 

LED's by energising the latter imagewise, wherein the width of a written line increases in 
the direction of the rows linearly with the energisation time of an LED by using LED's 

having a specific light output distribution and by their position in the rows.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a printer provided with an exposure device, and the 
exposure device itself. Devices of this kind are known, for example, from US patent 4 536 778 or 
EP 0 189 664. 
The exposure devices described therein are formed by two rows of LED's which, as 
considered in the scanning direction, are offset from one another over a specific 
distance. In this way lines can be written on a passing photosensitive element, the 
line width corresponding to the width of one LED. As a result, if the lines to be 
imaged are oblique, the well-known step structures form. The images, for example, 
of letter characters are not true to nature with these discrete line widths, due to 
rounding-off errors. The image of a line extending in the sub-scanning direction can 
thus be reproduced one or two LED-widths wider or narrower, depending on its 
position with respect to the LED's. 
These problems do not occur in the other direction, because the LED's can be 
switched on or off exactly at the image boundaries. 
Thus asymmetries in resolution occur between the two directions in the known 
devices. A number of solutions are known in order to reduce step structures as far as 
possible. WO 91/07843 describes a method in which one LED is energised 
pulsewise with a specific pattern at image transitions situated between two LED's, so 
that image edge areas are formed with a specific sequence of white and black dots. 
Viewed from some distance, a pattern of this kind will yield a more or less gradual 
transition to the eye. 
This solution has proved unsatisfactory in view of the increasing quality 
requirements that prints must satisfy. To increase the resolution as considered in the scanning direction it is also 
known to expose an image dot or pixel for a time shorter than that required to 
expose the entire pixel. Each image line drawn with an LED can thus be divided, 
for example, into four sub-lines by dividing an energisation pulse for one pixel into 
four equal sub-pulses, the sum of the energisation times of which is equal to the 
time of the energisation pulse for one entire pixel. 
As will be explained in detail hereinafter, this method with the known LED arrays 
yields a non-linear distribution of sub-lines, so that, for example, grey tints may be 
reproduced inaccurately. 
The object of the invention is to obviate the above disadvantages.  
 
In a printer according to the preamble to claim 1, this object is achieved in 
accordance with the invention with an exposure device as characterised in claim 1.
