2
together represent the radical of the 
formula  

 

 
in their (R)- or (S)-form.

to Claim 1, in which 


R and R
1
represent hydrogen, 
R
2
represents chlorine 
 
or 


R
1
 and R
2
together represent the radical of the 
formula 


Process for preparing bisphosphines of the general 
formula (I) according to Claim 1, characterized in 

that halogenophenyl compounds of the general 
formula (II) 


 
in which 


R
1

2
have the meanings given above and 
Hal
represents halogen, in particular bromine, 
  
 

are reacted with diphenylphosphinic chloride of the 
general formula (III) 


 
in which
