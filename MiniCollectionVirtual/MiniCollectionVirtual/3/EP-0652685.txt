<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switching device, for example for use in a B-ISDN.In recent years, various information communications permitting low to high transmission rates have been developed. An ATM-related art has been regarded as a key to a success in reducing a load of an exchange that controls information transfer, and in integrating communication modes. In the field of the ATM-related art, an ATM switching device for switching ATM cells quickly and readily is attracting attention.A previously-considered ATM switching device, for example, as shown in Figs. 1a and 1b, requires an ATM switch element for switching an ATM cell, and line handlers for processing information necessary for switching an ATM cell based on header information (including six parameters GM, VPI, VCI, PT, CLP and HEC) of an incoming ATM cell, and for feeding the resultant information to the ATM switch element. Namely, when an ATM switch element switches an ATM cell, header information of the ATM cell must be used to switch the ATM cell.In such a device, however, where control information and address information constituting header information of an ATM cell are used as they are, a problem occurs in that control for switching an ATM cell becomes complicated since an amount of control information is insufficient and only a single address can be set. Also, a drawback arises in that respective loads to each ATM switch element get larger.From the above, the performance of an entire ATM switching device largely depends upon respective performances of each ATM switch element which is normally constituted in the form of a one-chip device.It is desirable to provide an ATM switching device which can realise a speedy and simple switching of an ATM cell or ATM cells.US-A-4 993 018 discloses a self-routing ATM switch module. In this module, a priority level of information packets is judged by checking attributes of a call. When a voice, video or other call requiring real time processing is detected, priority processing is performed on the router heading for passage through the module so that the information packet is transferred and processed on a priority basis, even in the case where FIFO buffers in the module are in an overload state. However, no discard processing of packets is disclosed.EP-A-0 393 898 discloses a switching device for information packets, according to the preamble of claim 1. In this device, a packet arrives with a first field comprising a variable number of address bytes, and a
