<ABSTRACT>
A particle image in a sample 63 is formed at an 
imaging position 56 by an objective lens 55 of a 

microscope, projected on the image picking up plane of a 

TV camera 58 via projection lens 57 and is subjected to 
photo-electric conversion. Image signals from the TV 

camera 58 are supplied to an image memory 75 via an A/D 
converter 74 as well as to an image processing control 

unit 76. Image signals outputted from the image memory 
75 are supplied to a characteristic picking out unit 78 

and there a plurality of characteristics of the particle 
concerned are picked out. The picked-out characterstics 

are supplied to the classification unit 79 and there 
classification of the sediment components is performed 

via a neural network with a learning capability. 
Accordingly, the classification unit 79 performs 

provisionally an automatic classification of the 
objective sediment components by making use of the 

inputted characteristic parameters. 
Whereby the device which allows accurate and fast 
automatic component particle analysis even for patient 

specimens containing a variety of components in high 
concentration is realized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a classification
and examination device of particles in fluids and, in
particular, relates to a classification and examination
device which is suitable for such as an automatic
classification and examination of sediments in urine and
an automatic classification and examination of blood
corpuscles in blood.When an examination engineer performs an examination
visually on particles in fluid, for example, on sediment
components in urine, the urine which is the object for
the examination is centrifuged and precipitated sediments
are dripped onto a slide glass. Then if necessary after
coloring the sediments on the slide glass, a specimen is
prepared and the examination engineer observes the
specimen visually through a microscope.Other than the above conventional method in which an
examination engineer performs an examination visually on
the sediment components in urine, devices which automate
these examinations are proposed in which particles are
flowed in a flow cell while being suspended in liquid and
optically analyzed.For example, JP-B-3-52573(1991), which corresponds 
to U. S. Patent No. 4,338,024, discloses a particle
analysis device in which a fluid specimen is passed
through a fluid passage having a specific configuration
so as to confine particles in the specimen in an extented
image taking area and to produce still images thereof.
With this particle analysis device a shape analysis of
the particles is possible through an image analysis of
the still images which allows an automatic classification
of sediments in urine with regard to the sediment shape.JP-B-3-41783(1991) discloses a conventional particle
classification and display device in which after taking
in images of particles in fluid, a predetermined image
processing is performed thereon, and in such image
processing only the particle portions are cut out from
the entire image for display purpose such that the
particles could not be identified automatically with the
image processing.Further, JP-A-3-100876(1991) discloses a device
having further advanced image processing function in
which edge detection of particle images and cutting out
of the particle image portions from the entire image are
performed, however identification of the particles still
had to be performed manually.Still further, JP-A-60-38653(1985), which
corresponds to U. S. Patent Nos. 4,393,466 and 4,612,614,
discloses a particle analysis method in fluid specimen in
which images of particles are displayed in a 
predetermined order. With this
