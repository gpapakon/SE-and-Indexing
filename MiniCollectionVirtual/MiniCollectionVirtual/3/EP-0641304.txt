<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
stereospecific chemical synthesis of optically pure
enantiomers of 2-aryl- alkanoic acids, especially those
of the biologically active (S)-aryl-propionic acids, in
good chemical yields, useful for preparing large
quantities thereof, and having a high optical purity in
the presence of molecular sieves (4.0 Å). The starting
material is a suitable substituted (4S,5S)-2- alkyl-4-alkoxy-5-phenyl-2-oxazoline
obtained from the
corresponding trialkyl orthoalkonates and (1S,2S)-(+)-2-amino-1-phenyl-1,3-diol.
The subsequent chemical steps
involve reactions with a strong lithium containing base,
such as lithium diisopropylamide; and aryl-halide with
succeeding protonation yielding large quantities of the
corresponding S-enantiomers with high optical purity
(>95%). The chiral aminoalcohol can be re-used, as well
as the molecular sieves with ease of separation and
retention of high optical purity or inexpensive
catalytic activities, respectively.The present invention relates to a
stereospecific synthesis, a process applicable to large
scale production, for preparing optically active 2-arylalkanoic
acids, especially 2-aryl-propionic acids in
high chemical yields and 95% optical purity as
determined by rotation and NMR- techniques. The
stereospecific synthesis makes use of suitable
substituted (4S,5S)-2-alkyl-4-alkoxy-5-phenyl-2-oxazolines
which can be easily obtained by reaction of
the corresponding trialkyl orthoalkonates and (1S,2S)-(+)-2-amino-1-phenylpropane-1,3-diol,
with subsequent 
lithiation with lithium containing base such as lithium-diisopropylamide
(LDA), followed by arylation through
the suitable arylhalide with subsequent protonation.
The enantiomeric excess of the S-enantiomer is
facilitated by a polar solvents and molecular sieves
(4.0 Å) at low temperatures between -20°C to -35°C.This chemical process yields high optically
pure 2-aryl-propionic acids at high chemical yields with
the advantage of re-use of the chiral amino-alcohol as
well as the molecular sieves. The R-enantiomer can be
obtained through the same route using the (1R,2R)-(-)-2-amino-1-phenylpropane-
1,3-diol instead of the (1S,2S)-(+)-antipode.The medicinal aspects of the aryl-acetic acids
and their 2-methyl analogues, especially the 2-(R,S)-aryl-
propionic acids, have been reviewed by Shen (Shen
T. Y., in: Wolff, M. F. (ed), Burger's Medicinal
Chemistry, 4th edition, part III, Wiley, Interscience,
New York, pp 1205-1271). Numerous clinical studies
continue to demonstrate the efficacy of this
