<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a 
cage from a thermoplastic polymer-containing m
aterial for a 
roller bearing and a method of manufacturing a roller bearing 

comprising such a cage. By cross-linking the polymeric 
material its properties, such as form retention and 

compatibility with lubricants, are improved. A roller bearing 
provided with a cage made from suitably cross-linked 

thermoplastic polymer-containing material can be used even at 
temperatures above the melting point of the polymer. According 

to the invention a roller bearing is manufactured by forming a 
cage from thermoplastic polymer-containing material, providing 

it with rotating bodies and only then cross-linking the 
material. This avoids damage to an otherwise already rigid 

cage during the insertion of the rotating bodies.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing a rolling element 
bearing, which rolling element bearing is provided with rolling elements and a cage, 
whereby the cage over its annular circumference comprises 
receiving means for the rolling elements, is formed from cross-linked 
thermoplastic polymer-containing material, is provided with rolling elements, 
and is assembled into a rolling element bearing. Such a method is known from DE-A-4 041 068. This 
publication discloses a method of manufacturing a bearing 
provided with a plastic cage comprising a cross-linked 
polyphenylene sulphide resin. The plastic is sufficiently 
flexible to allow the incorporation of rolling elements. The cages manufactured according to this method have 
the disadvantage that under a heavy load the cage looses its 
rigidity, form and functionality. This may cause damage or 
destruction of the rolling element bearing and may in some applications 
lead to dangerous situations. Moreover the polymer-containing 
material used is relatively expensive. The present invention aims at improving a method of 
the manufacture of bearings comprising cages from cross-linked 
polymer-containing material, whereby the above-mentioned 
problems are effectively eliminated. To this end the method according to the invention is 
characterized in that first a cage is formed from cross-linkable, 
thermoplastic polymer-containing material, that it 
is then provided with rolling elements and that the material is 
subsequently cross-linked under the influence of radiation and 
the cross-linked material-containing cage. This method is particularly useful when applying a 
cage having receiving means for rolling elements whereby the 
openings of the receiving means is smaller than the diameter 
of the rolling elements. The cage of which the material is not 
yet cross-linked and which is still somewhat flexible can, 
because of its flexibility be provided with rolling elements 
without being damaged, which is good for the operational life 
and allows operation under heavy loads. The radiation is preferably ionizing radiation, 
especially β-radiation.  
 In this way the intended cross-linking is effectively 
brought about. β-radiation possesses sufficient penetration 
and is radiation technically easy to handle. The invention will be further elucidated with the aid 
of the drawing which shows an example of an embodiment of a 
cage for a rolling element bearing manufactured according to the invention and in 
which the only Figure shows a radial view of
