<ABSTRACT>
The mechanism is located on a side area close to the 
connection between the seat and the backrest, and 

comprises an extension (3) of the seat frame (2) having 
a sinuous sector or edge (4) supporting a cam (6) mounted 

to turn freely about a shaft (7) and located between a 
pair of lugs (5) lying at the end of the arm (1) that 

constitutes the armrest as such, which lugs (5) and 
extension (3) have facing holes for the respective 

turning shaft (8), the extension (3) being kept fixed and 
the arm (1) turning to be able to take up a working or 

horizontal position, a folded down position and a folded 
up position, during which movements the cam (6) slides 

along and abuts on the sinuous sector (4) thereby for the 
cam to turn in either direction and for the stable 

positions to be reached when the arm (1) is moved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an armrest folding
mechanism essentially applicable to vehicle seat
armrests, for instance in passenger coaches and the like,
though it can also be used in folding other ancillary
seat objects, for instance foot-rests, folding trays,
leg-rests and so forth.The mechanism relies on a sinuous sector provided on
a projection from the seat which, with the rotatory steps
of a cam fitted between a pair of plates lying at the end
at which the armrest is hinged, allow the armrest to take
up a normal working position, a folded down position and
a folded up position, merely by pulling or pushing the
said armrest. The lugs between which the cam lies to turn
freely relative to the same and the seat projection with
the sinuous edge for the cam to slide, have an axial bore
facing each other for a turning shaft of the armrest as
such.Many kinds of mechanisms are known to allow vehicle
armrests to be folded from a horizontal or normal working
position of the armrest as such to a folded up or down
position, thereby to allow travellers to reach inner
seats, for it is well-known that there is little space
between seats and the backs of the front seats in a
passenger vehicle. Spanish utility model 295,215, belonging to the same applicant
and corresponding to the preamble of claim 1 of the present
invention, discloses
a folding device in vehicle seat armrests which
already provides for the armrest to take up the three
stable positions, namely a horizontal and normal working
position, an upward vertical position and a downward
vertical position, thereby not only to allow travellers
access to inner seats, but to enable passengers to move
along the aisle when carrying objects or baggage which
for want of the armrest looking down could be hampered or
impaired by the armrests.The folding device subject of such Spanish utility
model 295,215 can be considered to be an efficient device
for its purpose, albeit having an intricate construction,
for in addition to a cam and the conventional jointing
and hinging means between the arm and the seat body, a
catch, a band and other elements are required for the
armrest to be stable in its three positions, sound
signalling being moreover provided for the three
positions of the armrest. German patent DE-A-3 529 506 is known, which
discloses a folding armrest based in a profile that in
collaboration with a plate provided with two slits which
act as guiding and with a guiding bolt the armrest moving
is achieved and thereof the functioning possible
positions, that is to
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle seat armrest folding mechanism, that is
designed to allow the arm (1) constituting the armrest to

take up a first horizontal working position, a second
fully folded down position and a third fully folded up

position, the actual mechanism being located on a side
area of the seat close to the intersection with the

backrest, characterised by an extension (3) of the seat
frame (2) having a sinuous sector (4) supporting a cam (6)

which is mounted freely upon a shaft (7) having an axis of
rotation parallel to the axis of rotation of the arm (1),

whereby the cam (6) is arranged between two parallel
plates (5) lying at the lower end of the arm (1), the

position of said plates (5) matching the position of the
extension (3) of the seat frame (2), said extension (3)

and said plates (5) having holes facing one another for
mounting the corresponding turning shaft (8) of the arm

(1). 
A vehicle seat armrest folding mechanism according to
claim 1, characterised in that the sinuous sector (4) on

the extension (3) belonging to the seat frame has a first
projection (3a) followed by a recess (3b) which extends

into a convex branch (3c), followed by another projection
(3d) to continue into a large concavity (3e) and end

facing the projection (3) as another sharp projection
(3f) such that the cam (6) is supported by this sinuous

conformation when the arm (1) turns, to allow the said
cam (6) to turn in suitable directions and the arm (1)

itself to take up stable positions, namely the working,
folded down and folded up positions.
A vehicle seat armrest folding mechanism, as in
the above claims, characterised in that the cam (6) is

rectangular in outline with two slightly concavely curved
sides (6a, 6b), and two other sides (6c, 6d) 

having a much deeper concavity, four round vertices (7a,
7b, 7c, 7d) being defined in order for the concavities

and vertices to define cam (6) moving, abutting and
turning means when the arm (1) respectively moves up and

down hinged about the shaft (8).
