<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the positive location of 
workpieces and other articles. In one embodiment, this invention relates to the 
location and support of a workpiece prior to an inertia 
bonding operation. There are large numbers of techniques and apparatus 
suited for positively locating an article and fixing the 
article in a particular position. In the general area of the 
machining, fabricating and welding of metals, there are vast 
number of chucking, clamping and fixturing devices which are 
employed to locate and restrain a workpiece while various 
operations are performed. These prior methods and apparatus include the vises, 
clamps, chucks and other similar embodiments and extend in 
complexity to the complex fixtures which are used to locate 
complex articles such as automobile engine components as 
successive machining and finishing operations are performed. This invention was developed to solve a problem 
encountered in the inertia welding of large superalloy and 
titanium alloy disks to form a gas turbine engine structure 
known as a drum rotor. However, the invention is not limited 
to such applications. The inertia welding process is by now a well known, 
well developed process described, for example, in US-A-3,234,644, 
3,235,162, 3,462,826, 3,591,068 and 4,365,136. 
Another known fluid activated workpiece holder and support system is 
disclosed in US-A-3,548,487. In this prior art inertia 
bonding apparatus three workpieces are adapted to be friction 
welded together. The central workpiece is held stationary in 
a cradle structure having adjustable jaws in fixtures at 
opposite ends of the workpiece. The other two workpieces are 
rotated while being moved into contact with the opposite ends 
of the central workpiece and are mounted in hydrostatic 
bearing unit carriers having chuck elements to clamp the 
workpiece therein. The essence of an inertia welding process as it might 
be employed to bond two disks  
 
together is to hold one disk stationary, while rotating 
the other disk (usually with an attached flywheel). The 
rotating disk is forced against the stationary disk. 
The resultant frictional heat (resulting from the 
conversion of the kinetic energy to thermal energy) 
causes melting of the disks at the area where contact 
occurs. During the welding step, and especially at the 
end of the welding step, substantial axial pressure is 
applied to force the components together. In the bonding of drum rotor disks made of nickel 
superalloys, where the bond area is about 129 cm2

<CLAIMS>
A fluid activated workpiece holder and support system, 
comprising: 


a plurality of fluid activated means (A; 46, 47, 
48, 66, 67, 68) for generating of forces acting in a X-Y 

plane on a workpiece (54), said fluid activated means being 
arranged to positively locate the workpiece in said X-Y 

plane without any unbalanced force which would cause motion 
of the workpiece in said X-Y plane or any unbalanced force 

couple which would tend to cause workpiece rotation about 
an axis normal to said X-Y plane, 
said plurality of fluid activated means being 
interconnected in a hydraulic circuit by fluid passages 

containing valves (70) so that said workpiece is freely 
movable without constraints in said X-Y plane when said 

valves are open and fluid can flow between said fluid 
activated means, but workpiece motion in said X-Y plane is 

inhibited when said valves are closed to prevent fluid flow 
between said fluid activated means. 
A workpiece holder and support system according 
to claim 1, characterized in that the fluid activated means 

(A; 46, 47, 48, 66, 67, 68) are arranged to apply force in 
a radial inward direction to a spring ring (45) adapted to 

be placed around an outer surface of a workpiece (54), said 
spring ring comprising a metal ring having a series of 

keyholes therein, said key holes extending axially with 
respect to the ring axis of symmetry and comprising a 

cylindrical hole connected to a slot wherein said hole has 
a diameter which is at least four times the slot width but 

less than 50 % of the radial thickness of the ring, said 
hole being drilled closer to either diametrical ring  

 
surface than to the other and being connected with the 

further diametrical ring surface by said slot wherein the 
slots alternately connect with the inside diameter and 

outside diameter diametrical surface of the spring ring, 
whereby, said spring ring is capable of circumferential 

expansion and contraction and essentially incapable of 
expansion or contraction in the radial thickness dimension. 
Rotary inertia bonding apparatus of the type 
used to bond metallic articles (24, 30-33) together across 

a bond plane using frictionally produced melting and an 
applied force between the articles, said applied force 

being applied substantially perpendicular to the bond 
plane, and including a headstock (21) and means (26) to 

rotate one workpiece mounted in said headstock (21) and a 
tailstock (25) and means to hold the other workpiece 

stationary in said tailstock, characterized in that the 
inertia bonding apparatus includes a workpiece holder and 

support system according to claim 1 or 2.
