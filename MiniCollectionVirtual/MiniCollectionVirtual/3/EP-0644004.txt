<ABSTRACT>
A swaging unit (12) which is portable and which has 
a locking fitting to co-operate with separable components (22,23) 

to secure a sleeve (11) in an engagement with the swaging 
unit. In this manner, a tube (10) can be swaged onto the 

sleeve. The locking fitting has internal threads (29) which 
engage with external threads (27) on the separable components 

to facilitate engagement. The swaging unit can be finely 
adjusted by having fine threads (52) between a locknut (45) and a 

cage (20) for housing the mandrel (13).

<DESCRIPTION>
Providing a roller swaging tool for easy field
use, for instance, by aircraft operators that can swage
tubes and fittings at locations remote for maintenance
sites, is valuable.This invention relates to a roller swaging
tool. In particular invention relates to a tool for use
in swaging together a tube with a fitting. The invention also
relates to methods of using such a tool.Roller swaging tools using a mandrel which
extends axially and forces rollers radially so that the
tube is swaged onto a fitting are known. The
disadvantages of such known apparatus include the
relative bulkiness of the tool, the relative short life
of the mandrel and rollers which act under pressure to
effect the swaging, and the difficulty of using the tool
apart from complex computer controlled machinery.Portable swaging kits are known; however, the
units are relatively bulky, have a relatively short life
span, and are quite complex in use.It is the object of this invention to provide a
portable roller swaging tool to minimize the shortcomings
of the prior known roller swaging tools. FR-A-2 093 968 discloses an apparatus for swaging a tube to a fitting
according to the pre-characterising part of claim 1,
comprising a swaging unit including a mandrel rollers, a cage having apertures for
permitting roller movement relatively radially outwardly from the cage as the
mandrel is urged axially forwardly into the cage; separable components for holding a
sleeve in operable relationship and a fitting retainer for engaging the separable
components. In this apparatus, the inside of the separable components engage the
outside of the swaging unit. The use of this apparatus involves fitting the sleeve
around the tube, introducing the mandrel into the tube, closing the separate elements
around the tube, sleeve and swaging unit, and then engaging the fitting retainer with
the outside of the separate elements.By this invention, a roller swaging tool is provided which overcomes some
disadvantages of known roller swaging tools.According to the invention, an apparatus for swaging a tube comprises the features
of claim 1. The components are separated longitudinally
into at least two components and may have a threaded outer
surface for engaging a threaded inner surface of the
fitting retainer.In a preferred form of the invention the
rollers are secured in the cage by a roller
retainer movable about the cage, and the inner surface of
the roller retainer engages the rollers. Spring means
acts to urge the roller retainer into position over the
rollers. A

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for swaging a tube to a fitting comprising:

(a) a swaging unit including a mandrel (13), rollers (14, 15, 16), a cage (20)
having apertures for permitting roller movement relatively radially outwardly from

the cage as the mandrel is urged axially forwardly into the cage;
(b) separable components (22, 23) for holding a sleeve (11) in operable
relationship whereby a tube (10) can be swaged into engagement with the sleeve;

and
(c) a fitting retainer (28) for engaging and locking the separable components (22, 23),

characterised in that the fitting retainer (28) also engages with the swaging unit
so as to locate the components (22, 23) and sleeve (11) operably with the swaging

unit such that in an operable swaging relationship the fitting retainer is positively
locked with the swaging unit to form an integral unit.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 wherein the separable components are split
longitudinally into at least two components (22, 23), the separable components

including a threaded outer surface (27) for engaging a threaded inner surface (29) of
the fitting retainer.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the rollers are secured in the
cage (20) by a roller retainer (59) movable about the cage, the inner surface of the

roller retainer engaging the rollers, and spring means (63) acting to urge the roller
retainer into a position over the rollers.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 wherein the roller retainer includes a
groove (61) for securing a free end (62) of the spring means such that the spring

means engages in the groove thereby to secure the roller retainer to the spring
means.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 or 4, including an internal housing (64) for
location in a guard (44) for the cage, the internal housing having an aperture (70) for

receiving an end of the spring remote from the spring end with the roller retainer, the
aperture being a relatively eccentric offset for engaging a coil of the spring thereby

to affix the spring with the internal housing and the guard. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 5 wherein the fitting retainer (28) engages
with the swaging unit by means of a stud (41) engaging a groove (43) in the guard

(44) surrounding the cage (20).
Apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 6, wherein the mandrel (13)
includes a surface tapered towards a forward position, the tapered surface having a

first angle (α) defined relative to an axis through the mandrel, and wherein the
rollers (14, 15, 16) have a surface tapering towards a leading position, the tapered

surface and an axis through the rollers having a second angle (β), and wherein the
first angle is significantly larger than the second angle.
Apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 7, including a locknut (45) for
threaded engagement with the cage (20), the locknut being for adjusting the relative

location of the cage in the guard whereby the position of the guard relative to axial
location of the cage apertures is adjustable, the locknut being engageable in a

selected location with a threaded portion of the guard thereby to establish the
relationship of the guard relative to t
he cage apertures.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 8 including a removable retaining cap (53)
for engagement with a free end of the cage thereby to facilitate adjustment of the

mandrel and the cage.
Apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 9 including tooth means (80)
and slot means (81) for securing together the separable components (22, 23).
Apparatus as claimed in one of claims 1 to 10, wherein the rollers are
removable through apertures (17, 18, 19) of the cage (20).

relationship whereby a tube (10) can be swaged into engagement with the sleeve,
engaging a fitting retainer (28) with the separable components, 
engaging the fitting retainer (28) with the swaging unit, so as to locate the
components operably with the swaging unit in an operable swaging relationship

where the fitting retainer is positively locked with the swaging unit.
A method for swaging a tube (10) with a sleeve (11) using
