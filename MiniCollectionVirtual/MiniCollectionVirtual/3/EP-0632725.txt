<DESCRIPTION>
Avermectin compounds (formerly referred to
as C-076 compounds) have been known for a
considerable period of time as highly active
antiparasitic agents in animals including humans.
See U.S. Patent 4310519 to Albers Schonberg etal.,
describing the isolation of the avermectin compounds
from a fermentation broth. Many derivatives of
avermectin compound have been prepared and described
in the literature. One derivative in particular, the
22,23 dihydro derivative has been prepared and has
found considerable commercial success as
antiparasitic agents against internal and external
parasites of animals. That derivative is known as
ivermectin and is disclosed in U.S. Patent 4199569 to
Chabala etal. Other derivatives have been described
such as the 13-polyalkoxy avermectin compounds
disclosed in U.S. Patent 4587247 to Linn etal. The instant invention is concerned with
avermectin compounds substituted at the 4', 4" or 13
position hydroxy groups with an alkylthioalkyl
group. The preferred group is a methyl thiomethyl
group and the compounds are potent internal and
external antiparasitic agents with particularly acute
activity against ectoparasites of companion animals.The compounds of the instant invention are
best realized in the following structural formula:
n is 0, 1 or 2;A is single or double bond;R1 is present only when A is a single bond and is
H, OH, =O, =NOCH3 or halogen
which is selected from: fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine;
R2 is C1-C6 alkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl,
C4-C8 cycloalkenyl, phenyl, furyl or thienyl; 
R3 is OH or = NOH;B is a single or double bond;R5 is present only when B is a single bond and is
H, OH or halogen
which is selected from: fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine;
R4 is

and R6 is hydrogen or C1-C3 alkyl.In the above formula and throughtout the
instant specification of the term "halogen" is
intended to include the halogens fluorine, chlorine,
bromine and iodine.Preferred, compounds are realized in the
above structural formula when:
n is 0, 1 or 2;A is a single bond;R1 is H or OH;R2 is C1-C6 alkyl or C3-C8 cycloalkyl;R3 is OH;B is a double bond;R4 is as defined above; andR6 is hydrogen or methyl.Further preferred compounds are realized in the
foregoing structural formula when n is 0;
A is a single bond;R1 is H or OH;R2 is C3-C4 alkyl or C5-C6 cycloalkyl;R3 is OHB is a double bond;R4 is as defined above; andR6 is hydrogen.Additional preferred compounds are realized
in the following compounds: 
13-O-Methylthiomethyl-22,23-dihydroavermectin Bl
aglycone;13-Epi-O-methylthio
