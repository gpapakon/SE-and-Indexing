<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of sensing
the rms value of an electrical waveform and in
particular but not exclusively to a method of
controlling the rms voltage in a load circuit
supplied with a phase chopped sinusoidal voltage
waveform.The precise measurement of rms (root mean
square) values of non-sinusoidal waveforms has
hitherto required circuitry which is relatively
complex and expensive. A typical analogue circuit
computes the rms value by squaring the instantaneous
value of input signal, dividing this result by the
previously computed rms value and averaging the
result to provide an updated rms value. The
required linear circuits for the squaring and
division calculations result in considerable
complexity and expense if satisfactory results are to
be produced.A common circuit requirement is to provide in a
load circuit a constant rms supply voltage by
regulating a mains supply using a phase chopping
device, the phase firing angle at which the
sinusoidal mains voltage is chopped being adjusted to
regulate the rms power in the load circuit in order
to compensate for fluctuations in the amplitude of
the mains supply voltage and fluctuations in the load
impedance.US-A-4 779 007 provides a power supply circuit
for generation of uninterrupted AC power. The unit
has back up batteries and a charger for the batteries.
The unit receives mains AC and uses the mains AC to
charge a battery. The unit also rectifies the AC to
generate a direct current. The unit has a switching
unit to switch between the direct current produced by 
rectifying the AC current or direct current supplied
by the batteries. The selected current is then
converted to an AC output.US-A-3 564 389 provides a circuit for producing a
substantially steady-state signal representative of
the RMS value of a time-varying input signal. In the
circuit, the time-varying input signal is rectified
and then combined with a scaled version of the output
signal (i.e. the substantially steady state signal
representative of the RMS value), the resulting signal
then being averaged by a low-pass filter to provide
the output signal.The present invention seeks to provide a
relatively simple method of sensing the rms value of
the waveform in such circuits where the shape of the
waveform is known to be that of a phase chopped
sinusoidal waveform.According to the present invention there is
disclosed a method of sensing the rms value of a phase
chopped sinusoidal electrical waveform comprising the
steps of combining an input signal representative of
the

combining circuit (14,16) which produces a combining
circuit output (19) equal to whichever is the greater
