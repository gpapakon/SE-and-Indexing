<ABSTRACT>
An improved gas trap for mud logging is vertically 
mounted such that its lower end (16) is constantly beneath the 

surface (72) of mud flowing in a tank. The mud is drawn into 
a housing (12) where it is agitated to release the entrained 

gases which are drawn off the measurement. The spent mud is 
returned to the tank through a mud exit port (50) and related 

pipe (62) to a point below the level of the mud and remote 
from the mud intake to the gas trap. This gas trap is 

insensitive to mud level changes and is relatively free of 
maintenance requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus 
for uniformly and continuously drawing samples of gas entrained 
in a liquid containing a high percentage of solids. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for obtaining samples of gases contained in drilling 
mud coming to the surface from an oil well drilling operation. The conventional practice in drilling for oil is to use 
a special fluid, termed "drilling mud", which is pumped down the 
drill string to circulate from the drilling head and carry upward 
to the surface the debris created by the drilling operation. 
When a gas-containing strata is encountered by the drilling 
operation, a certain amount of the gas from the strata will be 
entrained in the drilling mud and thus be carried to the surface. 
Extracting these gases from the drilling mud allows determination 
of the presence of hydrocarbons and an estimate of the quantity 
of hydrocarbon being encountered. Analysis of the recovered gas 
can be used to make a determination as to the desirability of 
recovering the gas or oil from the particular strata. This 
practice is generally categorized as "mud logging". The known  
 
devices for accomplishing mud logging separate the gas from the 
fluid by an agitation or vibrating process. The gas, i.e. 
hydrocarbon, samples are collected in a gas trap during this 
operation. Gas traps of several different designs are currently 
used in the mud logging industry in order to extract light 
hydrocarbon gases from the return flow line mud for measurement. 
The purpose of this measurement is twofold: (1) to provide 
warning of dangerous underbalanced drilling conditions indicated 
by increased gas returns; and (2) to evaluate the formation being 
drilled for hydrocarbon productivity. Several different gas traps are currently used in the 
mud logging industry. The purpose of these trap systems is to 
measure the amount of gas in the drilling fluid, which gas will 
be representative of the formation gas. This measurement is 
critical to identification of productive zones during drilling of 
the well. However, existing traps are not reliable and are very 
dependent upon operating conditions, such as mud flow rate and 
air dilution of the sample as it passes through the trap. These 
parameters cannot be readily controlled by many existing trap 
designs. The fluid level, where the trap is installed, will 
change during the drilling operation. This change in level will 
affect the flow of fluid through the trap

A gas trap for a mud logging system, characterized 
by: 


a cylindrical housing (12) having a bottom end (16) with 
a restricted opening (18), a closed top end (14), and an 

intermediate member (20) with a restricted opening (22); 
means (76) to mount said housing in a mud receptacle with 
said housing in a substantially vertical condition and with 

the bottom of said housing extending below the surface of said 
mud; 
motor means (26) mounted on said top end (14) and 
connected to drive a shaft (30) coaxially of said housing; 
feed-through means (32) forming a seal between said shaft 
and said top cover; 
agitator means (42) attached to said shaft (30) and lying 
substantially between said bottom end (16) and said 

intermediate member (20); 
a mud exit port (50) between said intermediate member 
(20) and said top end (14); 
a mud exhaust line (62) connected to said exit port and 
extending below the mud surface and both spaced from and 

directed away from said bottom end (16); 
vent line means (38) to admit substantially gas-free air 
to said chamber; and 
means (34) to draw off from said chamber gas evolved from 
said mud. 
A gas trap according to claim 1 characterized in 
that said feed-through means (32), mud exhaust line (62) and 

vent line means (38), in combination, prevent uncontrolled 
mixing of external air and evolved gas while allowing 

independent setting of a sample line suction flow rate.  
 
A gas trap according to claim 1 or claim 2 
characterized in that said agitator (42) comprises a plurality 

of members (44,46,48) fixed to said shaft (30) at their upper 
ends and diverging to form a conical configuration when 

rotated, said agitator providing a substantially constant gas 
evolution versus trap immersion level characteristic. 
A gas trap according to any one of claims 1 to 3 
characterized in that said intermediate member (20) is fixed 

in said housing (12) below the mud exit port (50) and together 
with said bottom end (16) defines a mixing chamber (24) which 

limits mud flow and enhances gas evolution at low trap 
immersion levels. 
A gas trap according to any one of claims 1 to 4 
characterized in that the mud exit port (50) is angled with 

respect to the axis of said housing to minimize mud splashing 
and therefore reduce resistance. 
A gas trap according to any one of claims 1 to 5

sensitivity. 
A gas trap according to any one of claims 1 to 6

a splash disc (58) having integral radial vanes (60) and 
being mounted on said shaft (30); and 
a second annular intermediate member (52) mounted in said 
housing spaced below said top end (14) and immediately above 

said splash disc (58) to minimize mud splashing in said 
chamber and improve gas mixing.
