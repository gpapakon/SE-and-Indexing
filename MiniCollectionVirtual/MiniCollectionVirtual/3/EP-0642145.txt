<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a tulip-type contact, intended to interact with a cylindrical male contact (1) and including parallel contact fingers (2), arranged side by side along the generatrices of a cylinder and provided with a common base part (3). The contact comprises a limiter of the radio travel of the fingers, which consists of a tube (4) coaxial with the fingers (2) on which the fingers (2) abut in maximum radial expansion position, and an elastic element (5) is associated with each finger (2), this element being arranged between the said tube (4) and the finger (2) and working in compression when the fingers (2) expand.

<CLAIMS>
Thimble-type contact designed to cooperate with a cylindrical male
contact (1) and provided with parallel contact fingers (2) disposed side-by-side

along generator lines of a cylinder and provided with a common base (3),
said fingers (2) including a stem (6) that is secured to said base (3) and a

contact tab (7) which is closer to the longitudinal axis (8) of the contact
than is the stem (6), said contact including a radial stroke limiter for

limiting the radial stroke of the fingers and constituted by a tube (4) which
is coaxial with the fingers (2) and against which the fingers (2) come into

abutment in the position of maximum radial expansion and 
characterized in
that
 said tube (4) is disposed on the insides of the fingers (2), and 
in that

in the expanded position the fingers (2) come into abutment against the tube
(4) via a surface (9) provided in each of the contact tabs (7) of the fingers

(2), each finger (2) is associated with a resilient member (5) disposed
between said tube (4) and the finger (2), and working in the compression

direction during radial expansion of the fingers (2).
Contact according to claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said resilient member
is a blade (5) having a fixing end that is fixed in the vicinity of said base

(3) and a free end that abuts against the fingers (2) when they are in the
rest position.
Contact according to claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the inside of each
tab (7) is provided with a notch (10) which receives the free end of the tube

and the free end of said blade (5).
Contact according to claim 3, 
characterized in that
 it is provided with a
rose (11) provided with grooves (12) for receiving the fixing ends of the

blades (5), the tube (4) locking said blades (5) in place once said rose (11)
is engaged on said tube, and itself being locked by the fingers (2), the base

(3) of the fingers (2) being fixed to said rose (11).
Contact according to claim 4, 
characterized in that
 the rose (11)
supports an inner heat-protection tube (13).
