<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for transferring a sheet (Pa) between a 
plurality of printing units (1, 2) is disclosed. A 

transfer cylinder (13) is provided between the adjacent 
units (1, 2) and is rotated by a motor (15). A drive gear 

(28) mechanically connected to the motor (15) and a driven 
gear (27) mechanically connected to the transfer cylinder 

(13) mate with each other. The press on a single surface 
and on both surfaces of the sheet (Pa) are selectively 

performed, and a phase between the gears (27, 28) is 
adjusted by a phase adjusting mechanism (29, 30, 41). 

Stoppers (55, 54) are formed with the drive gear (28) and 
driven gear (27) respectively, for stopping relative 

rotation between the gears -(2278, -28).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a sheet transferring apparatus
employed for an offset press, and more particularly to a sheet
transferring apparatus for transferring a sheet between a
plurality of printing units so as to perform a multiple color
press on a single surface of this sheet or a single color press
on both surfaces of this sheet.Printed matters such as pamphlets and catalogs are mostly
printed using offset presses. An offset press is capable of
multi-color printing and also well suited for mass printing.
Sheet-fed printers, to which printing paper sheets of the same
size are fed one by one to carry out printing, are widely
employed in such offset press. In a mode where printing is to be 
applied on both surfaces of the sheet (double-side printing) is
to be carried out in such type of sheet-fed printer, the sheet
must be reversed and transferred.As shown in Figs. 13 (a) and (b), the offset press is provided
with a feed cylinder 100 and a transfer cylinder 101, with a
supply cylinder 102 being disposed between and adjacent to these
cylinders 100 and 101. The supply cylinder 102 has a diameter
twice as great as those of the other cylinders 100,101. The
printing sheet Pa subjected to a first printing is forwarded
from the impression cylinder (not shown) to the feed cylinder
100 with the printed surface facing toward the cylinder 100.Subsequently, the sheet Pa retained on the transfer cylinder 100
is grasped at its front edge by the grippers of the supply
cylinder 102 and shifted to the outer surface thereof. The sheet
Pa is retained on the supply cylinder 102 with the printing
surface facing outward.In a mode where printing is to be applied on a single surface
with two colors (single-side printing) is to be carried out, as
shown in Fig. 13(a), the front edge of the printing sheet Pa
retained on the supply cylinder 102 is grasped by a plurality of
holders 103 arranged in the axial direction of the transfer 
cylinder 101. The sheet is reversed and then fed to the transfer
cylinder 101 with the printed surface facing inward. Meanwhile,
when the printing sheet Pa is to be printed on both sides
thereof, the rear edge of the printing sheet Pa retained on the
supply cylinder 102 with the printed surface facing outward is
grasped by the holders 103 and fed to the transfer cylinder 101
in the same posture, as shown in Fig. 13(b).Accordingly, when the printing mode is switched from single-side
printing to the double-side printing, the holders 103 of the
transfer cylinder 101 must grasp the rear edge of the

<CLAIMS>
A sheet transferring apparatus for transferring a sheet (Pa) between a plurality
of printing units (1,2) including a transfer cylinder (13) rotatably provided between the

adjacent units, a power source (15) for actuating the transfer cylinder (13), a first
rotating member (28) mechanically connected with the power source (15), a second

rotating member (27) mechanically connected with the transfer cylinder (13), and said
second rotating member (27) being arranged to be driven by the first rotating member

(28), wherein printing operations on a single surface and on both surfaces of the sheet
(Pa) are selectively performed, and a phase between the first rotating member (28) and

the second rotating member (27) is adjusted by a phase adjusting mechanism (29, 30,
41), and further including


stopping means (51, 52) formed with the first and the second rotating members
(27,28) respectively, for stopping a relative rotation between the first and the second

rotating members (27,28);
detecting means (57) for detecting a relative position of said first rotating
member (28) and said second rotating member (27) and
means (71) for protecting said stopping means (51,52), wherein said protecting
means stops the turning movement of said first rotating member (28) before said

stopping means (51, 52) abut against each other and restarts the turning movement of
said first rotating member (28) at a low speed to allow said stopping means (51, 52)

to abut against each other.
An apparatus as set forth in Claim 1, wherein the first rotating member includes
a drive gear (28) and wherein the second rotating member includes a driven gear (27)

mating with the drive gear (28).
An apparatus as set forth in Claim 2, wherein said drive gear (28) is set at a
reference position corresponding to a predetermined phase between the drive gear

(28) and the driven gear (27). 
An apparatus as set forth in Claims 2 or 3, wherein said stopping means
includes a first stopper (52) formed with the drive gear (28) and a second stopper (51)

formed with the driven gear (27), said first stopper (52) and said second stopper (51)
being arranged to abut against each other to stop relative rotation between said drive

gear (28) and said driven gear (27).
An apparatus as set forth in Claim 4, wherein said first stopper (52) and said
second stopper (51) being arranged to abut against each other when said drive gear

(28) rotates to the reference position.
