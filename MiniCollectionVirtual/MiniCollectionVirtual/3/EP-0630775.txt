<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a vehicle door of double-shell construction, comprising an outer shell (1) which ends flush with the other vehicle-body parts in the door-frame region, an inner shell (2) to which the interior panelling is attached and which is connected positively and/or non-positively to the outer shell during the assembly of the vehicle, and the door components which are required for the door and window operation and are accommodated in the interior space of the door, formed between the outer and inner shells, the outer shell comprising self-supporting profiled portions (1a, b) which in parts are double-walled or are completely double-walled, are open on the narrow sides and into which the door hinges and the door lock can be fitted, and the inner shell (2) being designed as a holder for functional members in which the door components can be fixed in a manner such that they can be exchanged.

A vehicle door of the double shell type, consisting 
of an outer shell (1) which is closable so as to be 

surface-flush with the remaining body parts in the region 
of the door frame, of an inner shell (2) to which there 

is secured an inner lining and which, during vehicle 
assembly, is form-fittingly and/or force-lockingly 

connected to the outer shell, and of the door components 
which are required for operating the door and window and 

which are accommodated in the door interior formed 
between the outer shell and inner shell, with the outer 

shell consisting of self-supporting, partially 
double-walled or fully double-walled profiled portions 

(1a, b) which are open at the narrow ends and in which 
the door hinges and the door lock are securable and which 

consist of one or more integral profiles which extend in 
the longitudinal direction of the vehicle and in whose 

cross-sections there are provided threaded channels 
and/or undercut grooves (3a, b) for fixing the inner 

shell (2) which is provided in the form of a functional 
carrier and in which the door components are replaceably 

secured, and that the inner shell comprises two upright 
edge regions or chamfers (8, 9) which laterally close the 

hollow chamber openings (10) at the narrow ends of the 
outer shell (1) provided in the form of a double-shell 

multi-chamber profile. 
A vehicle door according to claim 1,
 
characterized in
 
that the profiled portions (1a, b) consist of extruded  

 
aluminium profiles and that a disc frame (4) is secured 

to the inner shell (2) in the form of an extruded 
profile. 
A vehicle door according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the inner shell (2) consists of one or more 

die-castings. 
A vehicle door according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the inner shell (2) provided with a disc frame (4) 

is connected in untercut grooves (3) and threaded 
channels (5) respectively, which are arranged in the 

extruded profiled portions (1a, b) of the outer shell. 
A vehicle door according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that for the purpose of positioning the door hinges in 

the undercut grooves (3) of the outer shell (1), there 
are arranged groove blocks which, in the form of 

mechanical clamping elements, are movably and fixably 
arranged in the XY-plane of the door.  

 
A vehicle door according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that at the outer shell and at the inner shell (2) and 

also at the profiles (1a, b), there are provided side 
projections (6a, b) which partially overlap in the door 

frame. 
A vehicle door according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the extruded profiled portions (a, b) are provided 

in the form of multi-chamber hollow profiles comprising 
inwardly pointing webs (7) which extend in the direction 

of driving and are arranged perpendicularly relative to 
the outer shell. 
A vehicle door according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
 
that the extrusion alloy is an aluminium alloy of the 

6000 series. 
A vehicle door according to any one of the preceding 
claims,
 
characterised in
  
 

that the inner shell (2) consists of one or more 
deep-drawn plates. 
A vehicle door according to claim 9,
 
characterised in
 
that the inner shell (2) consists of one or more plastic 

injection moulded parts or fibre-reinforced plastic 
parts. 
A vehicle door according to claim 9,
 
characterised in
 
that the inner shell (2) consists of a plastic, profiled 

or plate metal part or is produced by a mixed casting 
method.
