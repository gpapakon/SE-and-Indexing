<ABSTRACT>
A flange (6) for coupling a cylindrical element (4) to be driven at a high rotational speed with an inner, and coaxial, rotating axle (2), comprising a first cylindrical inner part (26) connected with the axle, and connected via a connecting part (12), to a cylindrical radially outer part (20, 10) which bears the cylindrical part (4), with which it is intended to accomplish to retain a good contact, also at high rotational speeds, between this outer surface (10) and the rotor (4) carried on it. For this purpose the connecting part (6) in the invention is formed by two disc-shaped parts (14, 16) situated at a distance from one another in an axial and radial direction, the outermost (14) of which is connected to the outer part (20) via an essentially right-angled transition, the innermost (16) of which is connected to the inner part (26) via an essentially right-angled transition, and which are connected to one another via an intermediary part (24) via an essentially right-angled transition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an arrangement comprising 
a flange for coupling a cylindrical element to be driven at 
a high rotational speed with an inner, and coaxial rotating 
axle, comprising a first, cylindrical inner part suitable 
for being connected to the axle and connected via a connecting 
part to a cylindrical outer part to which the cylindrical 
element is attached, said element being situated radially 
outside of said outer part, said connecting part comprising 
two disk-shaped parts, lying at a distance of each other in 
the axial direction and being interconnected by an intermediary 
part via respective essentially right-angled transitions. Such an arrangement is known from US Patent 
Specification 5,012,694. This known arrangement is intended 
to be used in an energy storing flywheel and more particularly 
for interconnecting the ring-shaped parts of such a flywheel 
which is made up of a number of concentric, distinct, ringlike 
components. During operation these ringlike components exhibit 
a radial growth. The known arrangement is intended to take-up 
such a radial growth as a result of the fact that the disk-shaped 
parts, which are lying at an axial distance of each 
other can move with respect to each other in the axial 
direction resulting in a radial movement of axially 
directed flanges which are connected to these parts and bear 
against the inner surface of an outer ringlike component so 
that during operation the engagement of surfaces thereof with 
the inner surface of the outer component is maintained. The 
engagement with the inner component is maintained by a special 
inner ringlike retaining component corresponding to the intermediary part mentioned above. This specific known 
structure is only suitable to be used with low-mass flywheels. The invention aims to provide an arrangement of  
 
the above mentioned kind which can be used with a flywheel 
having a relatively large mass, which is able to yield 
elastically in a radial direction while the radial rigidity 
which is required to counteract any radially concentrated 
loads and which is also necessary for a good vibration 
behaviour is neverthless maintained. To this purpose the disk-shaped parts are also 
situated at a distance from one another in the radial 
direction, the outermost thereof is connected to the outer 
part via an essentially right-angled transition, and the 
innermost thereof is connected to the inner part via an 
essentially right-angled transition the outermost of said 
disk-shaped parts is only
