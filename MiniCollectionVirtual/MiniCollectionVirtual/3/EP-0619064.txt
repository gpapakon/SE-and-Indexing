<ABSTRACT>
A device that prevents wrapping of long strands of 
fibrous material around an exposed rotating shaft (5) has a 

stationary flange (10) fixed to the chassis (2) or bearing housing (6) 
for 

the shaft (5) and a rotating flange (11) fixed to the shaft (5). The 
flanges (10,11) are positioned to pass one another during each 

revolution of the shaft (5). When the flanges (10;11) are nearest to 
one 

another, a loop of vegetation forms tightly around the 
flanges (10,11). Continued rotation of the shaft (5) then stretches and 

tears the loop apart. This loop forming and tearing is 
repeated for each revolution of the shaft (5) to effectively 

prevent fibrous material from wrapping around the shaft (5).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a device that prevents long 
strands of vegetation and fibrous material, including grass, 
from wrapping around an exposed rotating shaft of a machine. 
In particular, the device is useful for preventing the shaft 
of a cutting head or bailing roll from being wrapped with 
fibrous material during use. Cutters and other machines having rotating shafts, such 
as bailers, frequently experience wrapping problems wherein 
the grass, vegetation or other fibrous matter being worked on 
wraps around the rotating shaft. If a sufficient amount of 
wrapping occurs, it impedes rotation of the shaft, and causes 
an additional strain to be placed on the engine and shaft 
bearings. The wrapping problem is particularly prevalent when 
a rotating shaft is exposed to long vegetation, such as field 
brush, vines, grass and hay, for example. Conventional lawn mowers having steel blades do not 
encounter a wrapping problem when the grass being cut is 
relatively short. Lawn mowers are able to cut the grass 
strands more than just once and expel the clippings from the 
housing with a strong blowing force created by the rotation of 
the blades. This cutting action, which produces short pieces  
 
of grass in combination with the blowing of the clippings out 
of the housing prevents most of the grass from wrapping around 
the shaft. When steel blade mowers are used to cut tall 
grass, however, a wrapping problem can be experienced. One 
method for coping with this problem is to provide a shaft 
having primary and secondary cutting elements. The primary 
cutting elements are typically steel blades such as those 
found on a conventional lawn mower and the secondary cutting 
elements are typically short steel blades positioned 
vertically above the primary blades for cutting any clippings 
that reach the shaft above the primary cutting blade. Once 
all of the vegetation is cut to a sufficiently short length, 
it cannot wrap around the shaft. The wrapping problem in general, has been recognized, and 
several attempts have been made to avoid the problem. One 
such attempt is to prevent the rotating shaft of a machine 
part from being exposed to the material being cut, bailed or 
transported, etc. To accomplish this, a shroud or seal is 
provided between the rotating shaft and the bearing housing. 
This is intended to prevent the shaft from being exposed. 
Despite such attempts, however, the best function that a 
shroud can perform is to minimize the exposure of the area of 
the shaft that is in contact with
