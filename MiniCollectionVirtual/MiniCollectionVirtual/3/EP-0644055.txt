<ABSTRACT>
A tape cutting device includes a fixed blade fixed to 
a frame and a movable blade fixed to a manually pivotable 

lever. A printing operation to the print tape is performed 
by a print head and a platen. In this case, the tape runs 

by the rotation of the press roller and a tape feed roller, 
those being driven by a driving motor 2 through a power 

transmitting portion including a gear train. A gear of the 
gear train is associated with a tape cutting prevention 

mechanism including a stop lever. When the tape printing 
operation is carried out, the stop lever is movable to a 

first pivot position where the manually pivotable lever is 
abuttable on the stop lever to prevent the manually pivotable 

lever to be angularly rotated. When the tape is to be 
cut, the stop lever is moved to a second pivot position 

offset from the manually pivotable lever. Thus, the movable 
blade can be moved toward the fixed blade to cut the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a print tape forming
apparatus having a tape cutting mechanism, and more particularly,
to such apparatus capable of performing a printing
operation on a tape accommodated in a tape cassette while
drawing out the tape from the cassette, and capable of
cutting the tape at a predetermined length after printing
is made thereon.A print tape forming apparatus of this type is
disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Application Kokai No.
2-56666. According to the publication, a tape cassette has
spools for each winding thereover a transparent print tape
formed of a synthetic resin, an ink ribbon, and a double-side
adhesive tape which is temporarily attached to a
peelable tape at one side thereof. This cassette is loadable
into a print tape forming apparatus.A lamination type print tape forming apparatus is
proposed which includes a print head such as a thermal head
or the like, a platen, and a feeding means for feeding out
the tape to the outside of the cassette. Image data such as
character data, etc. to be printed are beforehand input in
the print tape forming apparatus, and on the basis of a
print instruction the transparent print tape is printed
with mirror images corresponding to the image data along a 
longitudinal direction of the tape while feeding out the
tape by the actuation of the feeding means. The double-side
adhesive tape is adhesively attached to a printed surface
of the tape.A receptor type print tape forming apparatus is also
proposed in which an ink ribbon, a print tape of synthetic
resin and an adhesive tape are accommodated in a cassette.
The print tape is beforehand adhesively attached to one
surface of the adhesive tape whose another surface is
temporarily adhesively attached with a peelable tape.
Alternatively a heat-sensitive coloring print tape is
adhesively attached to one surface of an adhesive tape
whose another surface is temporarily adhered with a peelable
tape. Such heat-sensitive print tape and the adhesive
tape are accommodated in a cassette without accommodation
of the ink ribbon. Printing is performed by a print head
while feeding the print tape.The above described print tape forming apparatus are
normally provided with a manual cutting device for cutting
the printed tape at a predetermined length. In such conventional
apparatus, an operator may inadvertently manipulate
the manual cutting device during printing operation, so
that the tape running is disturbed by a blade portion,
which in turn occurs unwanted tape winding around the
feeding means,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A print tape forming apparatus comprising:

a frame (1);
feeding means
(7, 17, 18)

supported to the frame (1) for feeding a
tape (9), the feeding means having a power transmission means (17)

rotatable in one direction for feeding the tape in a forward
direction (X) for printing, and in opposite direction for

feeding the tape in a retracting direction;
printing means (3, 6) supported to the frame for performing
a print on the tape when the tape (9) is fed in the forward

direction (X);
cutting means (20) supported to the frame for manually
cutting the tape (9) after printing, the cutting means being

movable in a cutting direction (A, D) for cutting the tape, and
movable in a non-cutting direction; and
means (30, 31, 32) for preventing the cutting means (20) from being
moved in the cutting direction (A, D) when the tape is fed in the

forward direction (X), the preventing means (30, 31, 32) being supported to
the frame (1) and connected to the power transmission means (17)

and being movable between a first position in accordance
with the rotation of the transmission means in the one

direction for engagement with the cutting means, and a
second position in accordance with rotation of the transmission

means in the opposite direction for disengagement from
the cutting means.
The print tape forming apparatus as claimed in
claim 1, wherein the cutting means comprises:


a fixed blade (22) fixed to one end of the frame;
a lever member (25) pivotally supported to the one end of
the frame, the lever member being movable in the cutting

and non-cutting directions; and
a movable blade (23) fixed to the lever member (25), the lever
member being manually angularly movable to move the movable

blade towards the fixed blade for cutting the tape and away
from the fixed blade for allowing the tape to pass between

the fixed and movable blades.
