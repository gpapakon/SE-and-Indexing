<ABSTRACT>
Amide-thiolate ligands having improved metal chelate formation kinetics are disclosed. The ligands include an amine to facilitate rapid formation of an amine-amide-thiolate intermediate complex, followed by transfer of the metal to or conversion of the ligand to a thermodynamically stable amide-thiolate complex. In one embodiment of the invention, the amine is a tertiary amine, or its equivalent, strategically located to facilitate complex formation. In another embodiment of the invention, the amine is part of pyridine containing a lower alkoxy substituent in the 2 or 4 ring position. O-dealkylation occurs upon complexation causing the amine to become a vinylogous amide as part of a thermodynamically stable amide-thiolate complex. The amide-thiolate ligands of the present invention may be used for post formed labeling of biological substances for use in the fields of diagnosis and therapy.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to novel amide-thiolate
ligands having improved metal chelate formation
kinetics. The amide-thiolate ligands of the present
invention may be used for post formed labeling of
biological substances useful in the fields of diagnosis and
therapy.Scintigraphic imaging and similar radiographic
techniques for visualizing tissues invivo are finding
ever-increasing application in biological and medical
research and in diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
Generally, scintigraphic procedures involve the preparation
of radioactive agents which upon introduction to a
biological subject, become localized in the specific organ,
tissue or skeletal structure of choice. When so localized,
traces, plots or scintiphotos depicting the invivo
distribution of radiographic material can be made by
various radiation detectors, e.g., traversing scanners and
scintillation cameras. The distribution and corresponding
relative intensity of the detected radioactive material not
only indicates the space occupied by the targeted tissue,
but also indicates a presence of receptors, antigens,
aberrations, pathological conditions, and the like.In general, depending on the type of radionuclide and
the target organ or tissue of interest, the compositions
comprise a radionuclide, a carrier agent designed to target
the specific organ or tissue site, various auxiliary agents
which affix the radionuclide to the carrier, water or other
delivery vehicles suitable for injection into, or
aspiration by, the patient, such as physiological buffers,
salts, and the like. The carrier agent attaches or
complexes the radionuclide to the peptide carrier agent,
which results in localizing the radionuclide being 
deposited in the location where the carrier agent
concentrates in the biological subject.Triamidethiolate and diamidedithiolate ligands have
been used successfully for radiolabeling macromolecules.
In general, amide-thiolate systems require harsh (75°C-100°C)
radiolabeling conditions for preparing technetium
and rhenium complexes. Under these conditions, the
stability and biological properties of the small and medium
bioactive peptides are often degraded.In order to avoid harsh labeling conditions, pre-formed
complexes have been coupled to the protein with some
success. See Fritzberg et al., U.S. Patents Numbers
4,965,392 and 5,037,630 incorporated herein by reference.
In the "pre-formed approach," the ligand is complexed with
the radionuclide and then conjugated to the bioactive
peptide. A major disadvantage of the
