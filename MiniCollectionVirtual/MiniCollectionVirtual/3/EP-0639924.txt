after a movement of the moving object between the previous and 
current frames; and coding mode controller for determining, for 

each of the coding blocks in the current frame, whether the 
coding block belongs to the uncovered area or not, and applying 

the intro coding technique to the coding block regardless of 
the adaptively selected coding mode.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is related to a digital video signal
coding system according to the preamble of claim 1.In digital video signal coding applications such as high
definition television, video conferencing system, video
telephone and video door phone, video signals are transmitted
in a digitized form. When the video signals comprising a
sequence of video frames is expressed in a digitized form,
there is bound to occur a substantial amount of digital data,
for each line in a video frame is defined by a sequence of
digital data elements referred to as "pixels". Since,
however, the available frequency bandwidth of a conventional
transmission channel is limited, in order to transmit the
substantial amount of digital data through the channel, use of 
a video signal encoding apparatus may become necessary to
compress or reduce the volume of the data to be transmitted.The digital video signal can be normally compressed
without seriously affecting its integrity because there usually
exist certain correlationships or redundancies among some of
the pixels in a single frame and also among those of
neighboring frames. Out of various video compression
techniques, so-called hybrid coding techniques, together with
statistical coding techniques, are known to be most effective.Most hybrid coding techniques employ an adaptive
intra/non-intra coding, discrete cosine transform(DCT),
quantization of transform coefficients, and VLC(variable length
coding) as is well known in the art. An input video frame is
divided into coding blocks, referred to as macroblocks, with
each macroblock typically consisting of 16 x 16 pixels, and
processed as such according to a given hybrid coding scheme.
The adaptive intra/non-intra coding is a process of selecting
video signals for a subsequent DCT process from either
PCM(pulse code modulation) data of a current frame or motion
compensated DPCM(differential pulse code modulation) data of a
current frame adaptively, i.e., based on the variance thereof.The non-intra coding technique, which is based on the
concept of reducing the redundancies between neighboring
frames, is used to predict the current frame according to the
motion flow of an object and produce difference signals,
referred to as displaced frame difference(DFD) signals, 
representing the difference between the current frame and
its prediction. Normally, the resultant coded data length of
the DFD signals is shorter than that of the corresponding intra
coding signals.A scene in a video signal may be divided into two
portions:

An apparatus (100) for encoding video signals describing a
scene having at least one moving object (200) and a stationary

background, the video signals being represented by
a sequence of video frames (F(N-1),F(N),F(N+1)) including a

previous (F(N-1)), a current (F(N)) and a next (F(N+1))
frame and each video frame (F(N-1);F(N);F(N+1)) being divided

into a plurality of coding blocks, which comprises:

a) means (310) for determining a current frame difference
(FD(N-1,N)) and a next frame difference (FD(N,N+1)),

wherein the current frame difference (FD(N-1,N)) represents
differences between the current (F(N)) and the

previous (F(N-1)) frames and the next frame difference
(FD(N,N+1)) denotes differences between the current

(F(N)) and the next (F(N+1)) frames;
b) means (330) for detecting a transition region (A1,A2)
including a covered region (A1) and an uncovered region

(A2), wherein the covered region (A1) is an area
in the next frame (F(N+1)) which used to be visible in

the current frame (F(N)) but is hidden behind the moving
object (200) after a movement of the moving object

(200) between the current (F(N)) and the next (F(N+1))
frames, and the uncovered region (A2) denotes an area

in the current frame (F(N)) which used to be hidden
behind the moving object (200) in the previous frame

(F(N-1) but becomes visible after the movement of the
moving object (200) between the previous (F(N-1) and

the current (F(N)) frames; and
 
characterised in, that:


c) the transition region detecting means (330) are designed
to detect the transition regions by XORing the

current frame difference (FD(N-1,N)) and the next
frame difference (FD(N,N+1)); and

e) means (115) for selecting, for said each of the coding
blocks, either the predictive block or the corresponding

coding block by checking whether said each of the
coding blocks belongs to the uncovered region (A2) or

not to thereby provide a resultant block; and
f) means (120,125,130) for encoding the resultant block
to thereby provide an encoded video signal.

block is chosen.
