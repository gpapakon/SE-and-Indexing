<DESCRIPTION>
 PROTEIN L AND PROCESS FOR ITS PREPARATION BY RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGYThis invention relates to novel immunoglobulin binding proteins, processes for their production, recombinant DNA molecules coding therefor and recombinant DNA molecules useful as probes therefor.More specifically the present invention relates to the protein designated Protein L in substantially pure and/or intact and/or homogeneous form and to recombinant DNA molecules coding for Protein L.A multitude of Gram-positive bacteria species have been isolated that express surface proteins with affinities for mammalian i munoglobulins through interaction with their heavy chains. The best known of these immunoglobulin binding proteins are type 1 Staphylococcus Protein A and type 2 Streptococcus Protein G which have been shown to interact principally through the C2-C3 interface on the Fc region of human immunoglobulins. In addition, both have also been shown to interact weakly to the Fab region, but again through the immunoglobulin heavy chain.Recently, a novel protein from Peptococcus magrrus , Protein L, has been reported that was found to bind to human, rabbit, porcine, mouse and rat immunoglobulins uniquely through interaction with their light chains. In humans this interaction has been shown to occur exclusively to the kappa chains. Since both kappa and lambda light chains are shared between different classes. Protein L binds strongly to all human classes, in particular to the multi-subunited IgM, and similarly is expected to bind■ to all classes in species that show Protein L light chain binding.Both peptococcus and peptostreptococcus have been reported to produce Protein L, which binds to the Kappa light chain of human immunoglobulins. It has been proposed that Protein L is a virulence factor; non-virulent peptococci and peptostreptococci appear to neither express Protein L nor have the structural gene for it (Kastern et al 1990). 

 Protein L is of particular interest since it has been reported to bind to the Kappa light chain which is present in all classes and sub classes of immunoglobulins. As such it should prove to be a useful diagnostic reagent for use in ELISA and RIA techniques. Existing methods for producing Protein L typically rely on its extraction and purificarion from bacteria expressing Protein L on their cell surface. Such methods are by their nature inefficient, yielding a low yield of impure protein and taking a long time to perform. Protein L obtained in this way may in addition be incomplete.EP-A-0255 ^ 7 describes
