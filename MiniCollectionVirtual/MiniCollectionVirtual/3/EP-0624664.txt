<ABSTRACT>
A method of preparing a crystal of a Y-series 123 
metal oxide is disclosed, in which a substrate is immersed in 

a liquid phase which comprises components constituting the 
metal oxide. The liquid phase contains a solid phase 

located at a position different from the position at which 
the substrate contacts the liquid phase. The solid phase 

provides the liquid phase with solutes which constitute the 
Y-series 123 metal oxide so that the solutes are transported 

to the position at which the substrate and the liquid phase 
contact, thereby permitting the Y-series 123 metal oxide to 

grow on the substrate as primary crystals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of preparing
a Y-series 123 metal oxide crystal.Known methods for the preparation of a thin
film of a metal oxide of a Y-series 123 structure include
a vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method and a CVD
method. These methods, however, have a problem that
expensive and difficult to handle apparatus must be used.The present invention has been made with the
foregoing problems of the conventional methods in view.EP-A-0573193, which is in the state of the art
by virtue of Article 54(3) EPC, discloses a method of
preparing a crystal of a Y-series 123 metal oxide,
comprising contacting a substrate with a liquid phase
which contains a melt of a mixture of metal oxides and in
which a solid phase is present at a position different
from the position at which said substrate and said liquid
phase contact, said solid phase providing said liquid
phase with solutes which constitute said Y-series 123
metal oxide so that said solutes are transported to the
position at which said substrate and said liquid phase
contact, thereby permitting said Y-series 123 metal oxide
to grow on said substrate as primary crystals.In accordance with the present invention there
is provided a method of preparing a crystal of a Y-series
123 metal oxide, comprising contacting a substrate with a
liquid phase which is contained in a crucible which
either is held in an atmosphere selected from vapors of
silver alloy, and vapors of a silver compound, or is
immersed in a melt selected from silver, silver alloys
and silver compounds, wherein said liquid phase contains
a melt of a mixture of metal oxides and in which a solid
phase is present at a position different from the 
position at which said substrate and said liquid phase
contact, and said solid phase provides said liquid phase
with solutes which constitute said Y-series 123 metal
oxide so that said solutes are transported to the
position at which said substrate and said liquid phase
contact, thereby permitting said Y-series 123 metal oxide
to grow on said substrate as primary crystals.Illustrative of suitable Y-series 123 metal
oxides produced by the method of the present invention
are superconductive Y-series metal oxides.The term "Y-series 123 metal oxide" used in the
present specification and claims is intended to refer to
a metal oxide having the formula:
AB2Cu3O7-x
wherein A stands for a rare earth element such as Y, Sm
or Pr, B stands for an alkaline earth metal such as Ba
and x is a number of 0-1.The solid phase to be used in the method of the
