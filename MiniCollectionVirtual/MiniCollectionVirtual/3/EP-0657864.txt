<ABSTRACT>
First and second source bias voltages (V
S+
, 
V
S-
) are generated alternately every frame period. 
The polarity of a gradation level signal (V
a
) given 
to each picture element on a selected gate bus is 

inverted every frame period, the resultant signal is 
added to the source bias voltages. V
S+
, and V
S-
, 
and the obtained source voltages (V
S
) are outputted 
to the respective source buses. A gate voltage (V
G
) 
given to each gate bus comprises a period of a high-level 

gate pulse which causes a thin film transistor to 
conduct during the time nearly equal to the
 horizontal 
scanning interval (H) in each frame period, a gate 

bias period which precedes continuously the rise 
of the high-level gate pulse and in which the gate 

voltage (V
G
) takes first and second gate bias voltages 
(V
x1
, V
x2
) alternately every frame period, and a low-level 
period other than the above two periods. The 

high-level gate pulses given to the respective gate 
buses are shifted in time by the horizontal scanning 

interval (H) from each other in succession. The gate 
bias period in the i-th row has the time width from 

the rise of the high-level gate pulse of the i-th row to 
a time point after the fall of the preceding high-level 

gate pulse in the (i-1)-th row. Thereby, the first and 
second gate bias voltage (V
x1
, V
x2
), which are given 
in the i-th row, are applied alternately to the picture 

elements in the (i-1)-th row, correspondingly to 
each negative or positive write period in alternating 

current drive, and flickers generated in the liquid 
crystal display are reduced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an AC-drive
method for an active matrix liquid crystal display and,
more particularly, to an AC-drive method which is
intended to lessen display flicker and reduce power
consumption by combining a bias voltage with a display
drive voltage.The display image quality by the active matrix
liquid crystal display (hereinafter referred to as AMLCD)
has been drastically improved in recent years. The prior
art device has, however, a problem of flicker and a
problem that a fixed image is printed immediately after
being displayed; various solutions to these problems have
been reported. In view of its use such as a liquid
crystal TV or the like, it is desirable that the AMLCD be
driven with as low power consumption as possible.Solutions to the flicker problem are disclosed in
Japanese Pat. Laid-Open Gazette Nos. 29893/86 and
59493/86. The methods proposed therein, however, do not
compensate for a DC voltage which is caused by the
dielectric anisotropy of the liquid crystal material used
and a parasitic capacitance in the AMLCD itself, and
hence do not reduce the flicker for each display pixel
but merely lessen apparent flicker all over the display
screen.A method for reducing the power consumption of
the source driver is proposed in Japanese Pat. Laid-Open
Gazette No. 116923/87, for instance, but the proposed
method does not compensate for the DC voltage by the
dielectric anisotropy either. The drive method which compensates for the DC voltage attributable to the dielectric anisotropy
is set forth in "Compensation of the Display Electrode Voltage Distortion" (Japan Display '86, p.
191-195; this will hereinafter be referred to as literature 1) and "COMPENSATIVE ADDRESSING
FOR SWITCHING DISTORTION IN A-SI TFTLCD" (Euro Display '87, p. 107-110; this will
hereinafter be referred to as literature 2).Literature 1 proposes a method which compensates for the DC voltage by changing the
amplitude of an image signal voltage between positive and negative sides of its amplitude
center. This method is defective in that the positive-negative amplitude ratio needs to be
changed in accordance with the magnitude of the image signal. Literature 2 proposes a method
which applies a correcting pulse via a capacitance provided in an adjacent gate line; the above-mentioned
DC voltage is not generated in principle. The both methods compensate for the DC
voltage but do not provide any improvements in the reduction of power dissipation of the source
driver.A method which cuts the power consumption of the
