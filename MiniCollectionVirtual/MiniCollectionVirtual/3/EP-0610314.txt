<ABSTRACT>
Herbicidal triazolecarboxamides are useful as agricultural chemicals. In particular the compounds are useful as herbicides, both general and selective, both post-emergent and pre-emergent. Examples of selective activity include excellent control of blackgrass and wild oats with outstanding wheat tolerance, and control of crabgrass, giant foxtail, barnyardgrass and blackgrass with outstanding tolerance to corn, soybeans, rice, cotton, wheat, sugarbeets and rape.

 TITLEHERBICIDAL TRIAZOLECARBOXAiVUDESCROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONThis application is a continuation-in-part of copending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/784,343, filed October 29, 1991."BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates to certain substituted triazolecarboxamides which are useful as herbicides and their agriculturally suitable compositions as well as methods for their use as general or selective preemergent or postemergent herbicides or as plant growth regulants.New compounds effective for controlling the growth of undesired vegetation are in constant demand. In the most common situation, such compounds are sought to selectively control the growth of weeds in useful crops such as cotton, rice, corn, wheat and soybeans, to name a few. Unchecked weed growth in such crops can cause significant losses, reducing profit to the farmer and increasing costs to the consumer. In other situations, herbicides are desired which will control all plant growth. Examples of areas in which complete control of all vegetation is desired are areas around railroad tracks, storage tanks and industrial storage areas. There are many products commercially available for these purposes, but the search continues for products which are more effective, less costly and environmentally safe.EP-A-332,133 discloses triazole compounds of the formula:. R,N - • N — CON -' R,A-S (O) n ,wherein 
AisP 1-106,883 discloses herbicides of the formulawherein, inter alia, X and Y are independently CH or N. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis invention comprises novel compounds of Formula I, agriculturally suitable compositions containing them, and their method-of-use as preemergent and/or postemergent herbicides or plant growth regulants.wherein 

A is a 5-membered heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from the group 0-3 nitrogens, 0-1 oxygen and 0-1 sulfur, and is substituted with 1 to 4 substituents selected from R3, R4, R5 and R6;R1 is H; C^-Cg alkyl optionally substituted with C1-C3 alkoxy or 1 to 5 halogens; C3-C6 cycloalkyl; C2-Cg alkenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 halogens; C3-C6 alkynyl; or CJ-C3 alkoxy;R2 is Cj-Cg alkyl optionally substituted with C1-C3 alkoxy or 1 to 5 halogens; C3-C6 cycloalkyl; C -Cζ alkenyl optionally substituted with 1 to 3 halogens; or C3-C6 alkynyl;R1 and R2 may be taken together to form -(CH2)3-, -(CH2)4-, -(CH2)5- or-(CH )6-, each ring optionally substituted with 1 to 3 substituents selected from halogen and C1-C3 alkyl;R3, R4 and R5 are independently H; halogen;
