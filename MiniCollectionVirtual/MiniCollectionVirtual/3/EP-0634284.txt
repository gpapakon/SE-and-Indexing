<ABSTRACT>
A recording medium (25) is provided which comprises 
a base sheet and an ink-receiving layer on at least one 

face of the base sheet, the ink-receiving layer 
containing at least: (i) polyvinyl alcohol or a 

derivative thereof, (ii) polyalkylene oxide or 
derivative thereof, and (iii) a hydrophilic acrylic 

resin composed of a copolymer of a first vinyl monomer 
having a cationic group with a second vinyl monomer 

having a hydrophobic group. A recording method is also 
provided which employs the above recording medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a recording 
medium, particularly to an ink-jet recording medium. 
The present invention also relates to an ink-jet 
recording method employing the recording medium. Various recording mediums are used for ink-jet 
recording, including coated-paper sheets, glossy-paper 
sheets, OHP-recording films (recording films for 
overhead projectors), etc. An example of the coated 
paper is the one disclosed in Japanese Patent 
Publication No. 3-26665 which comprises a base paper 
sheet and a coating layer composed of fine powdery 
silica and a water-soluble binder such as polyvinyl 
alcohol. An example of the glossy paper is the one 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3-25352 
which comprises a cast-coated paper sheet and a surface 
layer composed of polyvinyl alcohol of a saponification 
degree of 50 to 90 mol% and a crosslinking agent. An 
example of the OHP-recording films is the one which is 
disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 
60-220750 which comprises a polyester film and a 
hydrophilic surface layer composed or a water-soluble  
 
polyvinyl alcohol of a saponification degree of 70 to 
90 mol%. With improvements in performance of ink-jet 
recording apparatuses in recording speed, multiple 
color recording, and so forth, the recording medium 
therefor is required to be improved to have the 
properties below simultaneously: 
(1) The recording medium has higher ink-absorbency (a 
larger ink absorption capacity, and quicker ink 
absorption). (2) The recorded dots have high optical density with 
definite circumference. (3) The recorded dots have a shape approximate to a 
true circle with smooth circumference. (4) The recording medium changes little its properties 
and does not curl with changes of temperature and 
humidity. (5) The recording medium does not cause blocking. (6) The recorded image is stable and does not 
deteriorate in long-term storage (particularly under a 
high temperature and a high humidity). (7) The recording medium itself is stable and does not 
deteriorate in long-term storage (particularly under a 
high temperature and a high humidity). OHP-recording sheets are additionally required 
to have excellent transparency. These required conditions are inconsistent with  
 
each other, and prior art technique does not give a 
recording medium satisfying simultaneously the above 
required properties. For example, the above-mentioned 
recording mediums of the prior art, although they are 
acceptable in the recorded dot shape and

<CLAIMS>
A recording medium, comprising a base 
sheet and an ink-receiving layer on at least one face 

of the base sheet, the ink-receiving layer containing 
at least: 


(i) polyvinyl alcohol or a derivative thereof, 
(ii) polyalkylene oxide or derivative thereof, and 
(iii) a hydrophilic acrylic resin composed of a 
copolymer of a first vinyl monomer having a cationic 

group with a second vinyl monomer having a hydrophobic 
group. 
The recording medium according to claim 1, 
wherein the polyalkylene oxide or the
 derivative 
thereof is contained in the ink receiving layer at a 

content ranging from 2 to 10 % by weight. 
The recording medium according to claim 1, 
wherein the hydrophilic acrylic resin composed of a 

copolymer of a first vinyl monomer having a cationic 
group with a second vinyl monomer having a hydrophobic 

group is contained in the ink-receiving layer at least 
at a larger content than the polyalkylene oxide or the 

derivative thereof. 
The recording medium according to claim 1, 
wherein the hydrophilic acrylic resin composed of a 

copolymer of a first vinyl monomer having a cationic 
group with a second vinyl monomer having a hydrophobic 

group is contained in the ink-receiving layer at a  
 

content ranging from 10 to 40 % by weight. 
The recording medium according to any of 
claims 1 to 4, wherein the base sheet is a plastic 

film. 
An ink-jet recording method which conducts 
recording by ejecting ink from an orifice of an ink-jet 

recording head onto the recording medium as set forth 
in claim 1 in accordance with recording signals. 
The ink-jet recording method according to 
claim 6, wherein the ink is ejected as droplets by 

action of thermal energy given to the ink.
