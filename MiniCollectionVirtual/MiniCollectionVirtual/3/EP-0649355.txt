<ABSTRACT>
Improvements relating to tools for cold flow forming of assembly points in sheet metal. The tools comprise a first tool (1) with a punch (6) and a blank holder (5) and a second tool (10) with a guiding surface (16) from which extends a finger (14) terminated by an anvil (15), a die (20) formed by at least two shells (18), each of said shells (18) having a shoulder (21) slidingly mounted on the guiding surface (16) and in contact with the lateral surface of the finger (14) through resilient means (26), the guiding means of the sections (18) being provided together with a stop restricting the separation of the shells (18) during cold flow. The improvements are characterized in that the stop consists of two half sections (30) elastically secured to the second tool (10).

Tools for creating joints between sheet metal by means
of cold forming, comprising a first tool (1) with a punch

(6) and a side pressing element (5) and a second tool (10)
provided with a support surface (16) from which a pin (14)

terminated by an anvil (15) erects, a matrix (20) comprising
at least two matrix-parts (18), each said matrix-part

(18) comprising a heel (21) arranged sliding against said
support surface (16) and being applied against the lateral

surface of the pin (14) by means of elastic means (26),
means for guiding the matrix-parts (18) being provided as

well as a stop means limiting the mutual lateral displacement
of said matrix-parts (18) during the forming 
characterised
in that
 the stop means comprises two shell-formed
parts (30) fixed elastically on said second tool (10).
Tools according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
lateral wall of each matrix-part (18) is provided with a

waist (24) and the shell-formed parts (30) are terminated
on the inside by a flange (36) co-operating with the edge

of the waist close to the heel, in order to constitute
guiding means for the matrix-parts (18).
Tools according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in
that
 the elastic means which applies the matrix-parts (18)
against the lateral surface of the pin (14) are constituted

by a spring (26) in the form of a ring arranged at the bottom
of the waist (24) of the matrix-parts. 
Tools according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

means (17) for preventing the rotation of the matrix-parts
(18) in relation to said second tool (10) are provided.
Tools according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the
heel (21) of at least one of the matrix-parts (18) is provided

on a surface turned in the direction of the corresponding
surface on the other matrix-part (18) with a notch

(22) and that the support surface (16) is provided with a
dowel co-operating with said notch.
Tools according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 each
shell-formed part (30) is provided with openings (37) at a

level corresponding to the support surface.
Tools according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 each
shell-formed part (60) comprises means (65) co-operating

with means (50) on the second tool (40) for preventing rotational
movement of said shell-formed parts (60) in relation

to said second tool (40).
Tools according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the
second tool (40) is provided with lateral flat surfaces

(50) and that each shell-formed part at its lateral inner
surface is provided with elastic means (65) arranged to co-operate

with said flat surfaces. 
Tools according to claim 1, 4 and 7, 
characterised in
that
 each shell-formed part (60) is provided with a dowel
(68) on its inner surface arranged to co-operate with a

notch (54) in the heel (47) of the matrix-parts (48).
Tools according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the
number of matrix-parts (48) is four, and that the heel (47)

is formed with a 90Â° corner and each of said corners (55)
on said heels is arranged to slide, during the movement of

the matrix-parts (48), into corresponding openings (67) in
the shell-formed parts (60).
