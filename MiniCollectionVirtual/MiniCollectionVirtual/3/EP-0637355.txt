<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an anchoring system for
installing exterior materials to a building structure
particularly suitable for when the exterior materials are to
be spaced at a distance from the structure.The use of insulation as a component of a building is now
widely practiced to obtain better comfort and to conserve
energy used for heating and cooling. However, if the
insulation is placed between the structure and internal
walls various problems can arise due to water condensation
within the wall. There are also limitations of available
wall constructions.one solution to this problem is to place the insulation
material outside the building structure. This method also
gives a protection to the structure from the expansion and
contraction caused by the temperature change at the various
time of the year. Moreover, a building built with heavy
materials such as concrete will store heat when the
insulation is placed outside the structure.Other benefits of having the exterior material cover the
insulation material placed outside of a building structure
include fire proofing and water proofing from the outside.
Additionally, there are advantages in the weather proofing
and protecting the structure from exterior impacts.
Furthermore, the exterior materials would allow for a wide
variety of design possibilities.However, insulation materials are usually soft and can not
hold heavy exterior materials. Also, the exterior materials 
placed at a distance from the structure exert great downward
forces and are difficult to attach to the supporting
structure. Consequently, these problems restrict the type
of exterior materials that can be attached to an existing
building structure, especially at distances from the
structure, even though this would be ideal from the building
science point of view. It also becomes difficult to attach
and support exterior materials to a building structure. It
is therefore important to have a connection system that is
strong enough to support these exterior materials without
being too difficult to attach.The method and anchoring system of the present invention solves the above problems
so that exterior materials can be easily and securely
attached to a building structure in order to obtain the
benefits of having the insulation material placed outside of
the structure.Furthermore, since the method according to the invention is
an easy installation method from outside of the structure,
it saves labor time and can be placed on existing building
structures with ease.U.S. Patent No.
