<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS)/bipolar
semiconductor device.It is known that bipolar transistors exhibit a low forward voltage drop (Vce)
when driven into saturation. However, a bipolar transistor requires a relatively large
amount of power to drive the device. Metal-oxide semiconductor field effect
transistor (MOSFET) devices require little power to drive them, but exhibit relatively
large voltage drops while turned on. An insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)
combines both a low on state voltage and a low drive requirement, but only if the
IGBT supports more than 1 volt or so across the device.US 5 101 257 discloses a semiconductor device comprising a bipolar transistor
merged with a MOS transistor, the two transistors are separated by a side wall spacer
and the bipolar transistor is self aligned with the MOS transistor. The drain region of
the MOS device is also the active base region of the bipolar transistor. The bipolar
transisitor has a first emitter region formed in the active base region and a second
emitter region formed on the first emitter region and partially overlying the gate of the
MOS transistor. A further device is disclosed in JP62293678.A monolithically integrated semiconductor device comprising a bipolar
transistor output stage having a base region and a collector region, wherein
   the bipolar transistor is a vertically formed transistor comprising a first
terminal being connected to a semiconductor substrate of first conductivity type forming the collector or emitter,
the base region comprising material of second conductivity type formed on the substrate, a first region
of first conductivity type connected to a second terminal; and
   at least one short channel field effect transistor having a gate terminal of
conducting material and comprising a second region of first
conductivity type, the second region being either formed within the base region or
in a further region of second conductivity type isolated from said base region by a region
of the semiconductor substrate, said further region being connected to the
base region by a metallic conductor,
   wherein a third region of second conductivity type is
formed within the second region a third terminal is connected to the second and third
regions thereby suppressing thyristor action, and the gate terminal being adjacent

terminal;
