<ABSTRACT>
A multiple position child restraint device (15) for use with vehicles, stretchers, cots, beds, and other transport apparatuses, and which can be folded into planar condition for storage and shipment. The restraint device includes substantially planar back support (20), seat support (50), and leg support (70) members hingedly attached in serial relationship with one another generally along a longitudinal axis. The hinged connection between the back support and seat members is preferably provided by a pair of oppositely disposed hinges (80) having a plurality of locking slots which align with one another at predetermined angular relationships, and wherein a locking bar (90) fits within the aligned slots to selectively lock the back support and seat members in one of a plurality of predetermined angular orientations. A multiple strap restraint device including a pair of shoulder straps (67) and a releasable buckle (65) secures to child on the seat and back support members, and an arrangement is provided for convenient adjustment of the shoulder straps along the longitudinal length of the back support member to accommodate children of different sizes without disconnecting the straps from the device. Folding lateral support panels (110, 102) are also provided along the opposite longitudinal edges of the seat and back support members.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for immobilizing and/or securely restraining 
a child for transportation or immobilization in motor vehicles, aircraft, and other 
modes of transportation, or on stretchers or other transport apparatuses, and, more 
particularly, to a pediatric restraining seat for use in emergency vehicles and with 
related emergency equipment which features multiple immobilizing or restraining 
positions as well as improved adaptability to children of varying sizes and foldability 
for compact storage and transportation. While continued improvements in technology and procedures has precipitated 
many changes in the construction, organization, and use of the wide range of 
equipment and procedures commonly associated with emergency vehicles such as 
ambulances, air transport devices and the like, reliability and storage requirements are 
always critical in selection of equipment available. While crash stable pediatric 
restraint and immobilizing devices are generally desirable and required in many 
emergency rescue and transportation situations, as well as other every day situations 
such as commercial air transportation and simple vehicular transportation and 
commuting, the various devices available in the prior art generally suffer from 
excessive size, bulk, degree of complication, and/or cost, which inhibits their 
widespread use. For example, U.S. Patent 4,181,356 (which issued to H. Fleischer) discloses 
a folding baby carrier which comprises a plurality of parts which can be folded into 
a flat arrangement. However, this carrier does not provide any restraint system, nor 
does it provide structure for reliably holding the child in a plurality of positions for  
 
safe, comfortable and/or convenient transportation. Similarly, while U.S. Patent 
4,058,342 (which issued to J. Ettridge) shows a foldable child's car seat, the device 
is relatively complex and bulky, and lacks means for easily adapting the seat to a wide 
range of child sizes. A wide variety of child safety carriers and seats have also been available for 
use in conjunction with motor vehicle transportation. For example, U.S. Patent 
4,274,674 (which issued to B. Deloustal) illustrates an example of a reclinable safety 
seat which can be anchored within a motor vehicle. The Deloustal safety seat 
provides several predetermined reclining positions, and two trough shaped half shells 
of semi-rigid synthetic material are hingedly connected to provide the main portions 
of the seat for supporting a child. A plurality of

<CLAIMS>
A multiple position child restraint device (15) which can be folded into a substantially 
planar condition for storage and shipment, said restraint device comprising: 


a substantially planar back support member (20) having a longitudinal length (L) 
and upper (22) and lower (24) edges along that length (L); 
a substantially planar seat support member (50) having front (57) and rear (58) 
edges and a rear face, said seat support member (50) being hingedly attached to said 

back support member (20) adjacent said rear and lower edges (58, 24), respectively; 
a leg support member (70) hingedly attached adjacent said front edge of said seat 
support member (50); 
a locking device (90) which locks said back support (20) and seat support (50) 
members in one of a plurality of predetermined angular orientations; 
 
   characterised in that said restraint device further comprises: 


a multiple strap restraint attached to said device (15) and comprising a pair of 
shoulder straps (67a, 67b) and a releasable buckle (65); 
and adjusting means (64, 65, 67) on said back support member (20) for adjusting 
said shoulder straps (67a, 67b) along said longitudinal length (L) to accommodate 

children of different sizes without disconnecting said strap restraint means from said 
device; 
and wherein said seat support member (50) is adapted to be folded in an 
overlapping planar arrangement with said back support member (20) with the rear face 

of said seat support member (50) and the rear surface of said back support member (20) 
in substantially face-to-face relationship without a need for structural reconfiguration of 

the restraint device (15). 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 1, wherein said locking device comprises a 
locking bar (90) which selectively interlocks with one or more hinges (80) connecting 

said back and seat members. 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 2, wherein said seat and back members are 
connected by oppositely disposed hinges (80) and wherein said locking device comprises  

 
a locking bar (90) which slidably and selectively interlocks with aligned locking slots 

(87) in at least one of said hinges (80) to prevent further rotation thereof. 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 1 wherein said adjusting means comprises a 
longitudinally reciprocable shoulder strap support (42) overlying a portion of said back 

support member (20). 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 4, wherein said shoulder strap support 
comprises a substantially planar adjustment plate (42) having a pair of spaced harness 

slots (48) through which said shoulder straps (67a, 67b) are individually supported, 
whereby longitudinal movement of said adjustment plate (42) along said back support 

member (20) correspondingly adjusts the position of said shoulder straps (67a, 67b). 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 4, wherein said device includes means (45, 46) 
for securing said shoulder strap support (42) in one of a plurality of predetermined 

longitudinal positions along said back support member (20). 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 6, wherein said securing means comprises a 
guide slot (40) and guide pin (44) arrangement for maintaining said shoulder strap 

support (42) in alignment during reciprocation along said back support member (20). 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 1, further comprising a pair of lateral support 
panels (102) located along opposite longitudinal edges of said back support member (20), 

said panels being hingedly rotatable relative to said back support member and lockable 
in a plurality of angular positions relative thereto. 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 8, further comprising a pair of later support 
panels (11) located along opposite longitudinal edges of said seat member (50), said 

panels being hingedly rotatable among a plurality of lockable angular positions relative 
to said seat member (50). 
A restraint device as claimed in claim 1, further comprising means (77) for
