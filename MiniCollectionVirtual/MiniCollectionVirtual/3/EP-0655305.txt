<ABSTRACT>
Method of manufacturing a laminated structure (1) intended for the manufacture of interior covering elements of a vehicle body, consisting in producing the structure (1) from a layer of a rigid support material (2), forming an insert (3), and a layer of pliant (flexible) material forming a skin (6). According to the invention, one or more incisions (7) are provided in the layer of rigid material (2) in predetermined areas, and at least one of the faces (4) of the support material (2) is covered, at least partially, by the said layer of pliant material (5) so that it acts cooperatively with the localised incision or incisions (7) in order to confer pliancy (flexibility) in the said areas. The subject of the invention is also a laminated structure (1) obtained by the implementation of the method, as well as an application of this method to the manufacture of interior covering elements of a vehicle body.
