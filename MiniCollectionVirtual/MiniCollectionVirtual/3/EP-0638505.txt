<ABSTRACT>
A strip (14) of stretch-wrap material having flat, 
double thickness hems (24, 26) at opposite margins is 

formed on an apparatus including a first roller (16) having 
a width less than the width of stock material fed into the 

machine, whereby opposite margins (18, 20) of the stock 
material project beyond opposite ends of the roller (16), 

and a second roller (22) for guiding the strip at an acute 
angle from the first roller (16) for causing the opposite 

marginal portions (18, 20) to fold. The strip (14) is 
maintained under tension by a take-up roller (32) or other 

means, and guide bars (28, 30) are provided for further 
folding the marginal portions past 90° angles so that they 

continue to be folded inwardly against the main body of the 
strip.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for reinforcing edges of a stretch film.Thin strips of elastic stretchable plastic material
have become widely used for wrapping goods or boxes of
goods to be stored or shipped. For example, it is common
practice to stack a plurality of boxes on a pallet for
shipping and to secure the boxes together, and with respect
to the pallet, by wrapping them with a film or strip of
resilient plastic material or, in other words, a stretch-wrap.
Such stretch-wrapped materials are quite thin and
are subject to rupturing or tearing at the edges,
particularly in situations where the goods being wrapped
have relatively sharp corners or uneven surfaces. Heretofore,
it has been suggested to reinforce the edges of
such stretch-wrapped materials by gathering or bunching the
edges to provide a so-called hem. While such hemming is
effective for reinforcing the edges, the bunching may be
uneven in appearance and effectiveness and provides ribs or
ridges in the ultimate package, which may be objectionable.GB-A-2,099,360 discloses an apparatus for hemming a
strip of plastic film maintained under tension and moving
along a first pre-determined path of travel comprising a
first guide member traversing said path of travel in a
position for engaging one side of said film, a second guide
member downstream of said first guide member and a folding
member positioned between said first and second guide
members for folding said marginal portions toward a 180°
arc with respect to said film to form a substantially flat
hem.US-A-4,905,451 describes a stretch wrap material
formed from an elongated, substantially flat film, in which
opposite margins of the film are folded to form triple
thickness layers for reinforcement.According to a first aspect of the present invention,
an apparatus for hemming a strip of plastic film 
maintained under tension and moving along a first predetermined
path of travel comprises a first guide member
traversing said path of travel in a position for engaging
one side of said film, a second guide member downstream of
said first guide member and a folding member positioned
between said first and second guide members for folding
said marginal portions toward a 180° arc with respect to
said film to form a substantially flat hem, and is
characterised in that said first guide member has an end
disposed inwardly of an adjacent edge of the film so that
said marginal portions of the film project beyond said end,
and said second guide member being positioned for

<CLAIMS>
An apparatus (10) for hemming a strip of plastic film
(14) maintained under tension and moving along a first predetermined

path of travel comprising a first guide member
(16) traversing said path of travel in a position for

engaging one side of said film (14), a second guide member
(22) downstream of said first guide member (16) and a

folding member (28, 30) positioned between said first and
second guide members for folding said marginal portions

(18, 20) toward a 180° arc with respect to said film to
form a substantially flat hem (24, 26), characterised in

that said first guide member (16) has an end disposed
inwardly of an adjacent edge of the film (14) so that said

marginal portions (18, 20) of the film project beyond said
end, and said second guide member (22) being positioned for

pressing against a side of said film (14) opposite from
said one side, and for directing said film (14) at an acute

angle from said first path of travel for causing said
marginal portion (18, 20) of the film to fold over said end

of the first guide member (16) at an acute angle from the
plane of said film (14).
An apparatus according to claim 1, which includes a
driven roller (32) disposed downstream from said second

guide member (22) for pulling said film (14) over said
first and second guide members and maintaining said film

(14) under tension.
An apparatus according to claim 2, wherein said
driven roller (32) comprises means for winding said strip

into a roll.
An apparatus according to any preceding claim,
wherein said first and second guide members are idler

rollers.
A method of hemming a strip (14) of a stretch-wrap
plastic film comprising maintaining said strip under

tension and moving said strip along a first pre-determined
planar path of travel, engaging a first side of said strip 

with a first guide member (16) while leaving a marginal
portion (18, 20) of the strip unsupported, changing the

direction of travel of the strip leaving said guide member
(16) to a second path of travel disposed at an acute angle

to said first path of travel, and thereby causing said
marginal portion (18, 20) to fold at an acute angle with

respect to the remainder of said strip, thereafter guiding
and further folding said marginal portion (18, 20) beyond

a 90° angle with respect to the remainder of said strip
while maintaining the strip under tension and thereby

causing said marginal portion (18, 20) to be folded through
180° into a flattened condition against the remainder of

the strip, and pressing a side of said strip opposite from
said one side for promoting the formation of a flat,

smooth hem (24, 26).
A method according to claim 5, which includes forming
a hem (24, 26) at a margin of said strip opposite from said

marginal portion in the same manner as said first mentioned
hem is formed.
An apparatus (10) for hemming a strip of plastic film
(14) of pre-determined width maintained under tension and

moving along a first predetermined planar path of travel,
comprising a first idler roller (16) traversing said path

of travel and positioned for engaging one side of said film
(14), a second idler roller (22) in position for engaging

a side of said film opposite from said one side, and guide
bars (28,30) positioned between said first and second

rollers, characterised in that said first roller (16) has
a length less than said predetermined width and is

positioned so that opposite marginal portions (18,20) of
said film project beyond opposite ends of said roller, said

second roller (22) directing said film from said first
roller (16) along a second path of travel disposed at an

acute angle with respect to said first path of travel,
whereby said marginal portions (18,20) of said strip

projecting beyond opposite ends of said first roller (16)
fold around opposite ends of said first roller (16), and in 

that said guide bars engage said marginal portions (18,20)
and fold said marginal portions beyond a 90° angle with

respect to the remainder of said strip for thereby causing
said marginal portions (18,20) to assume a 180° folded

condition to provide double thickness hems at opposite
margins of said strip, said second roller (22) pressing

against said strip for promoting flattening of said hems.
