<ABSTRACT>
Stable and effective multivalent vaccine compositions comprising Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) are described wherein the HBsAg component is stable for one week at 37  DEG C and is highly immunogenic, for example when the vaccine is administered to infants. The compositions typically comprise HBsAg adsorbed to aluminium phosphate and other antigens, especially those suitable for use in a paediatric vaccine, adsorbed to aluminium phosphate or aluminium hydroxide. Methods for preparing the vaccines and the use of aluminium phosphate to stabilise HBsAg in a multivalent vaccine formulation are also described.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel vaccine formulations, methods for preparing
them and to their use in therapy. In particular the present invention relates to novel
combination vaccine formulations including a Hepatitis B vaccine component for
treating Hepatitis B infections.Infection with Hepatitis B (HB) virus is a widespread problem but vaccines which
have been used for mass immunisation are now available, for example the product
'Engerix-B' (Registered Trade Mark; SmithKline Beecham plc). Engerix B (Registered Trade Mark)
has the Hepatitis B antigenic
component Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) which is obtained by genetic
engineering techniques.However it is often necessary or desirable to administer Hepatitis B vaccine at the
same time as other vaccines and this can involve multiple injections. Problems
associated with multiple injections include a more complicated administration
procedure and a large total injection volume.There is therefore a need for a combined vaccine comprising a Hepatitis B antigen in
combination with other antigens. The other antigens are in particular those capable in
a vaccine formulation of preventing Hepatitis A (HA), diphtheria (D), tetanus (T),
whole cell pertussis (Pw), acellular pertussis (Pa), Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib)
and polio (P).Aluminium hydroxide (AH) is widely used as an adjuvant in the formulation of
vaccines. For example, Engerix B Registered Trade Mark uses Hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) adsorbed
to aluminium hydroxide. We have also used AH successfully in the formulation of
Hepatitis A vaccine and in the combined vaccines DT, DTPw and DTPa. However,
when AH -adsorbed HBsAg is used in combination with other vaccines in a combined
formulation there is a substantial decrease of the immune response to HBsAg,
resulting in lower or insufficient seroprotection after vaccination. In addition the
stability of the HBsAg component of the combined vaccine is poor.Aluminium phosphate (AP) adsorbed HBsAg has been used in a commercially
available monovalent vaccine (HEPPACINE; Registered Trade Mark) made by Korean Cheil
Sugar Co Ltd.
We have found that there is no significant difference in immunogenic properties
between an AH- adsorbed HBsAg monovalent vaccine (Engerix B; Registered Trade Mark)
and an AP-adsorbed
HBsAg monovalent vaccine. Coursaget et al. (Infection and Immunity, Volume 51, No. 3, March 1986, pages 784-787)

<CLAIMS>
A vaccine composition comprising Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and a
number (n) of other antigens in combination with an adjuvant comprising one or more

aluminium salts in which the value of n is 1 or greater and in which the adjuvant used
to adsorb the HBsAg is aluminium phosphate (AP), with the proviso that when n is 1

the other antigen is not an antigen against Hepatitis A.
A vaccine composition as claimed in Claim 1 in which the said other antigens are
selected to provide immunity against one or more of the following:

diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, Haemophilus influenzae b, Hepatitis A,
meningitis A, meningitis B, meningitis C, and otitis media.
A vaccine composition as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which at least one of
the said other antigens is adsorbed to AP.
A vaccine composition as claimed in Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which at at least one of
the said other antigens is adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide (AH).
A vaccine composition as claimed in any preceding claim in which n is 2, 3, 4, 5 or
6.
A vaccine composition according to claim 5 wherein the said other antigens
provide immunity against diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) and pertussis (P).
A vaccine composition as claimed in claim 6 wherein the pertussis component is
whole cell pertussis (Pw) or acellular pertussis antigen (Pa).
A vaccine composition as claimed in Claim 6 or Claim 7 additionally comprising
an antigen against Haemophilus influenzae b (Hib).

the vaccine is such that the vaccine can be kept at 37°C for one week without

substantial loss of immunogenicity of the HBsAg component.
A vaccine composition according to any previous claim characterised in that the
immunogenicity of the HBsAg in the vaccine is such that a geometric mean titre of

200 mIU/ml (one month post third dose) or greater is found in human infants when a
course of the vaccine is given at one month intervals in an appropriate vaccination

schedule.

AH- or AP-adsorbed other antigens.
Use of aluminium phosphate (AP) as an adjuvant for adsorbing HBsAg,
characterised in that the use is for the purpose of formulating a stable and effective

combined vaccine comprising HBsAg and a number (n) of other antigens adsorbed on

ponding combined vaccine in which the HBsAg component is
adsorbed on AH, with the proviso that when n is 1 the said other antigen is not an

antigen against Hepatitis A.
Use according to claim 16 in which the stability of the vaccine is such that the
vaccine can be kept at 37°C for 1 week without substantial loss of immunogenicity of

the HBsAg.
Use according to claim 16 or claim 17 in which the immunogenicity in the
