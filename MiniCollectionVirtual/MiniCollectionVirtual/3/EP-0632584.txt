<DESCRIPTION>
This invention provides a power amplifier for amplifying a radio 
frequency signal, for example a pulsed power amplifier responsive to a 
control pulse. The amplifier is particularly useful for digital mobile 
cellular radio transmitters for use on the Pan-European GSM cellular 
network. In the field of power control circuits, EP-A-0261967 describes a 
control loop for a power amplifier in which a digital value is output from a 
controller and converted to analog form for control of the amplifier when 
input power falls below a minimum threshold. Power at the beginning of a 
new burst is the same as at the end of a previous burst. In a burst modulated power amplifier, the transmitter must observe 
a time domain template upon turn-on and turn-off, as well as a frequency 
domain template. In the past, the shape of the power characteristic as it 
rises at the start of a burst and falls at the end has been controlled by 
means of shaping circuits consisting of resistors and analog switches. 
Such circuits can be bulky and unreliable and have limited accuracy. As well as the above power/time characteristic, the output power of a 
GSM mobile radio transmitter must be adjustable in sixteen steps from +43 
dbm to +13 dbm. Many tolerance factors within the amplifier will affect 
the ultimate output power. Manual adjustment means can be provided for 
pre-setting the output power levels before the equipment leaves the factory, 
however separate adjustment means within the equipment for each of the 
sixteen power levels would be bulky, and their adjustment would be time 
consuming. It is an aim of the present invention to provide an improved power 
amplifier to overcome some of the above problems. According to a first aspect of the invention, an amplifier is provided 
comprising power selection means for selecting a nominal output power 
level from a plurality of discrete levels; power control means for controlling 
output power in response to said power selection means; input means for 
indicating measured output power; and storage means responsive to the 
input means for storing, for each of said nominal output power levels, 
information in response to the measured output power, for future 
adjustment of each nominal output power level when selected.  According to a preferred feature of the invention, the amplifier 
comprises: power selection means for selecting a nominal output power 
level from a plurality of discrete levels; power control means for controlling 
output power in response to said power selecting
