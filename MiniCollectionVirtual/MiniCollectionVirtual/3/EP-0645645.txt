<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a laser velocimetric probe including means (1-6) for generating interference fringes and measurement means (8-10) for determining the speed of a particle passing through the field of fringes on the basis of a signal representing the light backscattered by this particle. It comprises means (4) for generating at least two systems of fringes, and the measurement means are arranged to determine at least two components of the speed of the particle by frequency-based analysis of the said signal.

<CLAIMS>
Laser velocimetric probe which includes means
(1-6) for simultaneously generating at least two

interference fringe systems in a single measurement
volume and measurement means (8-10) for determining at

least two components of the velocity of a particle
passing through the fringe field from a signal

representing the light backscattered by this particle,
characterized in that the said fringe systems have the

same wavelength and that the measurement means are
arranged in order to determine the said at least two

components of the particle velocity by frequency
analysis of the said signal.
Probe according to Claim 1, in which the means
for generating the interference fringe systems comprise

means for forming four parallel laser beams.
Probe according to Claim 2, in which the four
beams form the edges of a prism having a rhomb-shaped

or rectangle-shaped base, and especially a square-shaped
base.
Probe according to Claims 1 to 3, in which the
means for generating the fringe systems comprise means

for forming laser beams of different intensities.
Probe according to Claims 1 to 3, which
includes means for temporarily and selectively

eliminating at least one of the fringe systems.
Probe according to Claim 5, in which the means
for eliminating fringe systems comprise means for 

changing the polarization of the beams from which these
systems are obtained.
