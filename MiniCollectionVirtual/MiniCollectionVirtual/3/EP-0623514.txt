<ABSTRACT>
To adjust the spacing between the drivers (1', 1''), the chain wheels (5', 5'') and (6', 6''), which guide the conveying chains (3', 3'') having the drivers (1') and the conveying chains (4', 4'') having the drivers (1''), can be rotated relative to one another. For this purpose, the chain wheels (6', 6'') are seated fixedly in terms of rotation, but the chain wheels (5', 5'') are seated rotatably on a central shaft (7) which can be driven in order to rotate the conveyor. The rotatable chain wheels (5', 5'') are driven via drive connections (11) by a secondary shaft (12) which is normally connected synchronously to the central shaft (7) via a gear (15) and a coupling (16). To adjust the spacing of the drivers (1', 1''), the two shafts (7, 12) are uncoupled from one another and rotated relative to one another to the desired extent. The chain wheels (5'', 6'') and the driving gearwheel (10) for the pair of conveying chains (7, 12) are moreover displaceable along the shafts (7, 12) for a change of spacing in relation to the pair of conveying chains (3', 4').

Conveyor apparatus for articles in packing machines, particularly for 
folding boxes in cartoning machines, with a number of drivers (1',1'') moving 

at fixed distances from one another, of which a leading driver (1') on the one 
hand and a trailing driver (1'') on the other in each case guides one of die 

objects between them without altering the shape of the latter, and with 
endlessly circulating conveyor chains (3',4',3'',4'') which bear the drivers 

(1',1'') and which at least at one point of their traject pass over chain wheels 
(5',6',5'',6'') which, in order to set the distance between the leading drivers 

(1') and the trailing drivers (1'') are adjustable in relation to one another as 
regards their rotation angle on a central shaft (7) bearing them, two of the 

chain wheels (6',6''), which bear conveyor chains (4',4'') with equally acting 
drivers, 
i
.
e
. only leading or only trailing, are connected with the central shaft 
(7) non-rotatably and also, in order to set the distance between the conveyor 

chains (3',4', and 3'',4''), in such a way as to be axially adjustable in respect 
of each other, characterized in that in the case of at least four conveyor 

chains, of which the two inner conveyor chains (4',4'') and the two outer 
conveyor chains (3',3'') in each case bear equally acting drivers (1'' and 1' 

respectively) of the corresponding four chain wheels, are the two inner chain 
wheels (6',6'') which are the chain wheels rotatably connected with the 

central shaft (7) and the two outer chain wheels (5',5'') are mounted rotatably 
on the central shaft (7) and insofar as they are positioned adjacent to an inner 

chain wheel (6''), also axially adjustable on the central shaft (7), are axially 
displaceable like the said wheels along the central shaft (7), that furthermore 

the outer chain wheels (5', 5'') are operatively connected (11) non-rotatably 
with coaxial toothed wheels (9',9'' respectively) and these toothed wheels 

with driving toothed wheels (10',10'' respectively), these driving toothed  
 

wheels (10',10'') being situated non-rotatably on an auxiliary shaft parallel to 
the central shaft (7) and, insofar as they are connected with a toothed wheel 

(9'') displaceable along the central shaft (7), are axially displaceable like die 
said wheels along the auxiliary shaft (12), and that the two shafts (7,12) can 

be driven synchronously with each other via a gearing (15) and one of the 
two shafts (12) can be disconnected by a shift coupling from the joint drive 

and in the disconnected state is rotatable in relation to the other shaft (7) in 
order to adjust the distance of the drivers (1',1''). 
Conveyor apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterized in that 
the two bearing cheeks (20,21) displaceable in relation to each other in the 

axial direction of the shafts (7,12) and adjustable in the guide direction are 
provided with each bearing in an axially non-displaceable manner one outer 

and one inner chain wheel of the chain wheels (5',6', and 5'',6'' 
respectively), the two chain wheels (5',6', and 5'',6'') each having a hub 

(50',60', and 50'',60'') passing through the bearing cheek (20,21) and, by 
means of the hubs and via roller bearings, are guided on one another and on

cheek (20,21).
