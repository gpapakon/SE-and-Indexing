<ABSTRACT>
This system makes it possible to carry out an operation on the internal window (2) of a "high-activity" cell while ensuring biological and radiological protection of the operators. It comprises means which make it possible to extract the inspection port (5) from the orifice and a shield (7), mounted movably with respect to a fixed structure (20, 21) and intended to close the orifice of the cell, when the inspection port (5) is extracted. It comprises handling means for carrying out an operation on the window (2), such as clamps (32), and equipment which can be passed through the shield (7) by means of a barrel (36). Application to cleaning the ceiling window (2) on shielded "high-activity" cells.

Method for intervening on a sealing pane (2) of an orifice 
of a "high activity" or shielded cell, the orifice including a 

shielding window (5) placed in front of the pane (2) on the outer 
side of the cell, said method consisting of : 


a) removing the shielding window (5) by pulling it outwardly ; 
b) immediately placing after stage a) on the outer side of the 
orifice a protective screen (7) for blocking it off completely, 

and remote handling means placed on the protective screen so as 
to carry out outside the operations on the pane (2); 
3) remove the protective screen (7), and 
4) put back the shielding window (5) in the orifice. 
System for intervening on the sealing pane (2) of an 
orifice of a shielded or "high activity" cell and possessing a 

shielding window (5) placed in front of the pane on the outer side 
of the cell and including : 


a frame (10) for introducing and extracting the shielding window 
(5), and 
a portico (20) for handling a protective screen (7) to be placed 
in front of the orifice, said protective screen (7) including remote 

handling means for acting on the outer face of the pane (2) from the 
outside. 
Intervention system according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the frame (10) includes : 


a fixed table (11) ; 
one lower carriage (13) mounted rolling on the table (11), and 
means for extracting the shielding window (5) and fixed to the 
table (11) so as to place the shielding window (5) on the lower 

carriage (13) and also to then replace it in the orifice. 
Intervention system according to claim 3, characterized in that 
the extraction means are formed of hydraulic jacks (16) fixed to the 

table (11) and whose rod (18) is equipped with means for picking up 
the shielding window (5).  

 
Intervention system according to claim 2, characterized in 
that the portico includes : 


a fixed structure (21) ; 
one first upper carriage (22) suspended from the structure (21) 
and mobile horizontally with respect to the wall (1) of the cell ; 
one second upper carriage (25) suspended from the first carriage 
(22) and mobile horizontally with respect to the latter in a direction 

perpendicular to the wall (1) of the cell. 
Intervention system according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the handling means include : 


two pot type joints (30) ; 
two pairs of pliers (32) mounted pivoting in the pot type joints 
(30) so as to be placed on the side of the pane (2) of the cell ; 
two handles (33) for the remote handling of the two pliers (32). 
Intervention system according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the protective screen (7) has vision means inside the cell. 
Intervention system according to claim 7, characterized in that 
the vision means are formed of a pane (37) loaded with lead. 
Intervention system according to claim 7, characterized in that 

the vision means are constituted by a video camera. 
Intervention system according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the protective screen (7) is traversed by transfer means. 
System according to claim 10, characterized in that the transfer 
means include : 


a spring barrel (36) mounted rotating inside the protective screen 
(7) and including a passage, 
a boat (34) placed at the end of a rake rod (35), these two objects 
able to pass through the passage of the spring barrel (36). 
Intervention system according to claim 2, characterized in that 
the protective screen (7) is made of lead. 
Intervention system according to claim 2, characterized in that  
 

the protective screen (7) has a lower flap taking support on the 
lower surface (6) of the orifice so as to provide biological 

protection when the protective screen is inserted inside the 
orifice.
