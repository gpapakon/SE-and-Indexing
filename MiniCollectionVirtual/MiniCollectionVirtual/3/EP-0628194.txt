<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an electrophoretic display panel
apparatus and methods of operation and, more particularly, to multi-electrode
electrophoretic display panels which permit single pixel erasure.Electrophoretic displays (EPIDS) are now well known. A variety of
display types and features are taught in several patents issued in the names of the
inventors herein, Frank J. DiSanto and Denis A. Krusos and assigned to the
assignee herein, Copytele, Inc. of Huntington Station, New York. For example,
U.S Patent Nos. 4,655,897 and 4,732,830, each entitled ELECTROPHORETIC
DISPLAY PANELS AND ASSOCIATED METHODS describe the basic
operation and construction of an electrophoretic display. U.S. Patent No.
4,742,345, entitled ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY PANELS AND METHODS
THEREFOR, describes a display having improved alignment and contrast. Many
other patents regarding such displays are also assigned to Copytele, Inc. The
following issued patents and pending applications by the inventors herein and
assigned to CopyTele, Inc. and which may have some relevance to the present
invention are: U.S. Patent No. 5,276,438, issued January 4, 1994, entitled
ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY PANEL WITH INTERNAL MESH
BACKGROUND SCREEN; DUAL ANODE FLAT PANEL
ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY APPARATUS, U.S. Patent No. 5,053,763,
issued October 1, 1991; ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY WITH SELECTIVE
LINE ERASURE, U.S. Patent No. 5,066,946 issued November 19, 1991;
SEMITRANSPARENT ELECTROPHORETIC INFORMATION DISPLAYS 
(EPID) EMPLOYING MESH LIKE ELECTRODES, U.S. 5,041,824 issued on
August 20, 1991; U.S. Patent No. 5,223,115 issued on February 16, 1993
entitled ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY WITH SINGLE CHARACTER
ERASURE;-U.S. Patent No. 5,223,823 issued on June 29, 1993, entitled
ELECTROPHORETIC DISPLAY PANEL WITH PLURAL ELECTRICALLY
INDEPENDENT ANODE ELEMENTS, each of which are indicated below.The display panels shown in the above-mentioned patents operate
upon the same basic principle, viz.,if a suspension of electrically charged pigment
particles in a dielectric fluid is subjected to an applied electrostatic field, the
pigment particles will migrate through the fluid in response to the electrostatic
field. Given a substantially homogeneous suspension of particles having a pigment
color different from that of the dielectric fluid, if the applied electrostatic field is
localized it will cause a visually observable localized pigment particle migration.
The localized pigment particle migration results either in a localized area of
concentration or rarefaction

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a tetrode-type electrophoretic
display (10) of the type having a plurality of parallel

cathode lines (18) arranged in a given direction, a plurality of
parallel grid lines (20) insulated from said cathode lines and

perpendicular thereto to form an X-Y addressing matrix, a plurality
of local anode lines (32) deposited upon said grid lines perpendicular

thereto and insulated therefrom by insulator strips
(34), a remote anode (26) separated from said local anode lines

with space therebetween accommodating an electrophoretic dispersion
including pigments particles suspended in a fluid and an

electrically conductive screen (28) allowing said pigment particles
to pass therethrough, characterized by the steps of:


electrically connecting said cathode lines (18), said
grid lines (20), said screen (28), said local anode lines (32)

and said remote anode (26) to a source of electrical potential
energy, said source simultaneously providing a selected set of

independent voltages to each of said cathode lines, said grid
lines, said screen, said local anode lines and said remote anode

under the control of control means (38) for controlling said
independent voltages supplied by said source; and
selectively erasing single pixels previously written on
said display by controlling said source of electrical potential

energy with said control means such that voltage levels are
applied to said cathode lines (18), said grid lines (20), said

screen (28), said local anode lines (32) and said remote anode
(26), wherein said step of selectively erasing single pixels

includes providing a voltage of approximately GRID (VDD) to
selected said grid lines and a voltage of approximately 0 to

selected said local anode lines intersecting said selected grid
lines at said single pixels to be erased, said GRID (VDD) voltage

corresponding, during the erasing step, to a zero voltage level.
The method of claim 1, further including a step of
local anode writing prior to said step of selectively erasing,

wherein said previously written single pixels are written upon
said local anode (32).
The method of claim 2, wherein said step of selectively
erasing single pixels includes maintaining all grid lines

(20) other than those intersecting pixels to be erased at an
approximate voltage of GRID (VSS); maintaining all local anode

lines (32) other than those intersecting pixels to be erased at

voltage approximately +V3; and maintaining a voltage of approximately
CATH (VDD) on said cathode lines (18).
The method of claim 3, further including placing
said local anode lines (32) in a hold condition by providing

approximate voltage levels of +V3 to said remote anode (26), 0
volts to said screen (28), +V3 to said local anode lines, GRID

(VSS) to said grid lines (20), and CATH (VDD) to said cathode
lines (18) before said step of local anode writing.
The method of claim 4, wherein said grid lines (20)
and said cathode lines (18) of said X-Y matrix define a plurality

of wells (21) proximate said plurality of intersections thereof,
said wells communicating with said space accommodating said fluid

and further including a step of removing excess pigment from said
wells and inducing the movement of pigment from said screen (28)

to said remote anode (26) by providing approximate voltage levels
of +V1 to said remote anode, VAC to said screen, 0 to said local

anode lines (32), GRID (VSS) to said grid lines, and CATH (VDD)
to said cathode lines prior to said step of placing said local

anode lines in a hold condition.
The method of claim 5, further including a step of
placing said selectively erased single pixels in a hold condition

after said step of selective pixel erasure by providing approximate
voltage levels of GRID (VSS) to said selected said grid

lines (20) and +V3 to said selected said local anode lines (32)
intersecting said selected said grid lines. 
The method of claim 6, further including a step of
fully erasing said display prior to said step of removing excess

pigment by providing approximate voltage levels of -V1 to said
remote anode (26), -V2 to said screen (28), 0 to said local anode

(32), GRID (VDD) to said grid lines (20) and 0 to said cathode
lines (18).
The method of claim 7, further including the step of
placing said display in a preliminary hold condition after said

step of fully erasing and prior to said step of removing excess
pigment by providing approximate voltage levels of +V1 to said

remote anode (26), +V2 to said screen (28), 0 to said local anode
lines (32), GRID (VSS) to said grid lines (20) and CATH (VDD) to

said cathode lines (18).
