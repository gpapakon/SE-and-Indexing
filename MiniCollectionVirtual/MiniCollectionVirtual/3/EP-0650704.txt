<ABSTRACT>
A method for adjusting focal point's positions of an 
intraocular implant, and a device for the method, wherein an 

intraocular implant provided partially with a magnetic 
material and substituted for crystalline lens is applied with 

magnetic flux at a high or low degree from the outside to 
move the intraocular implant forward and backward with 

respect to retina, thereby adjusting focal points of the 
lens.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method for adjusting focal 
point's positions of an intraocular implant and a device for the 
method, and more particularly to a method for adjusting focal 
point's positions of an intraocular implant, which is an 
artificial lens to be inserted in a human eyeball in place of 
crystalline lens extracted therefrom, and a device for use in 
the adjusting method. Human eyes essentially include eyeballs and optic nerve. 
These and appendages of eyeballs, i.e., eyelids, supercilium, 
conjunctiva, lacrimal apparatus and muscles of the eyeballs 
constitute the organ of vision. The outer wall of eyeballs 
comprises three layers of outer, middle and inner membranes, 
the outer membrane having cornea and sclera, the middle membrane 
having iris, ciliary body and choroid, and the inner membrane 
having retina. The eyeballs are filled substantially with 
vitreous body and have crystalline lens before the vitreous 
body. A space between the crystalline lens and cornea is filled  
 
with aqueous humor. The crystalline lens is an organ in the shape of biconvex 
lens and positioned centrally of the front half of the eyeball. 
Any objects placed near or far from human eyes are focused into 
an image on retina by the crystalline lens. For adjusting the 
crystalline lens to the objects near the eyes, ciliary muscle 
contracts to relax Zinn's zonule, which is in the shape of a 
flowery crown to sorround the crystalline lens, so that the 
crystalline lens becomes free of pulling by Zinn's zonule and 
increases in thickness due to elasticity of the crystalline 
lens itself. Thus, the adjusted crystalline lens can have the 
same function as of an optical lens of a short focal length. 
When the crystalline lens is adjusted to the objects placed far 
from human eyes, ciliary muscle relaxes to tense Zinn's zonule, 
so that the crystalline lens is applied with pulling force to be 
made thin and flat, thereby having the same function as of an 
optical lens of a long focal length. As above, the human eyes are exquisite, and the crystalline 
lens can be adjusted to the short or long range of scope by 
contracting or relaxing ciliary muscle to have separate focal 
point's positions and also to be increased or decreased in 
refraction factor as known. Patients with cataract are suffered from troubles in eyesight 
by opacity of crystalline lens which having the above 
important function. Surgically extracting the opaque crystalline 
lens placed centrally of the front half of eyeballs is an only 
effective

<CLAIMS>
A method for adjusting focal point's positions of an 
intraocular implant wherein an intraocular implant provided 

partially with a magnetic material and substituted for 
crystalline lens is applied with magnetic flux at a high or 

low degree from the outside to move the intraocular implant 
forward and backward with respect to retina, thereby adjusting 

focal points of the lens. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant comprising an intraocular implant provided 

partially with a magnetic material and substituted for 
crystalline lens and a magnetic flux generating spectacles 

for applying magnetism at a high or low degree to the 
intraocular implant to attract the same, so that the 

intraocular implant can be moved forward and backward with 
respect to retina. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant as set forth in claim 2, wherein the intraocular 

implant is, at the outer peripheral part except the paraxial 
region, with an annular magentic material member or a 

magnetic thin film and provides a spring for urging the 
intraocular implant toward retina, and the magnetic flux 

generating spectacles having in the frame a coil through which 
controlled electric current is flowed. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant as set forth in claim 3, wherein the frame of the 

spectacles to be placed before the intraocular implant is made 
 

of an annular magnetic material having a cross-section in a 
substantially rolled U-like shape and opening toward the 

implant, a winding wire being wound on the U-like shaped part, 
and an inner frame and an outer frame being tapered to their 

utmost ends, where the U-like shape of the cross section opens, 
to form magnetic poles at the utmost ends. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant as set forth in claim 2 or 3, wherein the frame 

of the spectacles before the intraocular implant is provided 
with tubular fixed frames, a rotary frame fit thereto and a 

motor for driving the rotary frame, the tubular fixed frames 
and the rotary frame each having a magnetic material member, 

so that the rotary frame is turned at a predetermined rotation 
angle to adjust magnetism to the intraocular implant. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant as set forth in claim 5, wherein one of the 

temple portions of the spectacles is provided with an infrared 
emitting part and the other with an infrared receiving part 

to detect a distance to an object and control the motor 
according to the detection results. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant as set forth in claim 2 or 5, wherein curved 

surface or surfaces of the intraocular implant at one side or 
both sides thereof is made aspherical to eliminate aberration 

on retina. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant as set forth in claim 2, wherein bridging parts 

 
of a leaf spring which has freedom unidirectionaly forms a 

a damper so as to fix the intraocular implant radially inwardly 
of the damper. 
A device for adjusting focal point's positions of intraocular 
implant as set forth in claim 2, wherein the damper 

portions formed by the leaf spring's bridging parts placed 
radially outwardly thereof are arranged almost in the middle 

of or between and with respect to the damper portions formed 
by the bridging parts placed radially inwardly of the spring.
