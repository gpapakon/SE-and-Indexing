<ABSTRACT>
An electrode structure (10) is made by applying a 
base layer of doped LaCrO₃ particles on a portion of an 

electrode (16) and then coating the particles with a top 
layer composition such as CaO+Al₂O₃, SrO+Al₂O₃, or 

BaO+Al₂O₃, and then heating the composition for a time 
effective to melt the composition and allow it to fill any 

open porosity in the base layer of doped LaCrO₃ to form an 
interconnection (26), after which solid oxide electrolyte 

(18) can be applied to the remaining portion of the electrode 
(16) and the electrolyte (18) can be covered with a 

cermet exterior electrode (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of 
depositing an electronically conductive interconnection 
layer on an electrode of an electrochemical cell. High temperature electrochemical cells are well 
known. In these types of cells, typified by fuel cells, a 
porous support tube of calcia stabilized zirconia, has an 
air electrode cathode deposited on it. The air electrode 
may be made of, for example, oxides of the perovskite 
family, such as doped lanthanum manganite. Surrounding the 
major portion of the outer periphery of the air electrode 
is a layer of gas-tight solid electrolyte, usually yttria 
stabilized zirconia. A selected radial segment of the air 
electrode is covered by an interconnection material. The 
interconnection material may be made of a doped lanthanum 
chromite film. The generally used dopant is Mg, although 
Ca and Sr have also been suggested. Both the electrolyte and interconnect material are 
applied on top of the air electrode by a modified electrochemical 
vapor deposition process, at temperatures of up to 
1450°C., with the suggested use of vaporized halides of 
zirconium and yttrium for the electrolyte, and vaporized 
halides of lanthanum, chromium, and magnesium, or calcium 
or strontium for the interconnection material. It would be economically desirable to form at 
least the interconnect material by a simple sintering 
process which would employ less expensive equipment and use  
 
low cost oxides or chemicals to form the desired interconnection. In U.S. Patent Specification No. 4,631,238 (Ruka), 
a Co and/or Mg doped lanthanum chromite interconnection was 
described. Means of making the interconnection were 
generally described as including vapor deposition and 
traditional sintering techniques. An improved method of bonding fuel cell interconnections 
was taught in U.S. Patent Specification No. 
4,861,345 (Bowker et al.), where particles of lanthanum 
chromite, doped with at least one of Sr, Mg, Ca, Ba and Co, 
and having on each particle surface a coating of CaO+Cr2O3, 
were placed on an air electrode surface and heated in air 
without any applied pressure. The Ca and Cr coated on the 
surfaces of the individual particles were incorporated into 
the structure of the lanthanum chromite. This system 
allowed formation of sintered interconnections without 
cracking the fragile air electrode by pressure techniques. 
A slurry of the particles in a Ca(NO3)2+Cr(NO3)3 solution 
was applied to the air electrode by brushing or tape 
casting. Heating then formed the layer on
