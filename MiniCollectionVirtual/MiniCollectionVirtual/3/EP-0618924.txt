<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is in the field of nucleic acid
hybridization assays. More specifically, it relates to
novel nucleic acid probes for detecting Hepatitis B Virus
(HBV).Viral hepatitis is a systemic disease involving
primarily the liver, with HBV being primarily responsible
for most cases of serum or long-incubation hepatitis.Antigenic characterization of HBV derives from
the complex protein found on the virus's surface. One
antigenic specificity, designated a, is common to all HBV
surface antigen (HBsAg), while two other sets of mutually
exclusive determinants result in four principle subtypes
of HBsAg: adw, ayw, adr, and ayr.Pasek et al. (Nature 282:575-579, 1979)
disclosed the entire nucleotide sequence of subtype ayw
HBV genomic DNA.Valenzuela et al. (Animal Virus Genetics, Field
et al., eds., Academic press, NY, 1981) reported the
complete nucleotide sequence of subtype adw2 HBV DNA.EPA Pub. No. 0068719 disclosed the sequence and
expression of HBsAg from the adw serotype. Fujiyama et al. (Nucleic Acid Research 11:4601-4610,
1983) disclosed the entire nucleotide sequence of
serotype adr HBV DNA.Kobayashi et al., Gene (1984), 30, 227-232
discloses the complete nucleotide sequence of HBV subtype adr
and its conserved gene organisation.British patent application No. 2034323A,
published 6/4/80, describes the isolation and cloning of
the HBV genome and its use co detect HBV in serum.Berninger et al. (J. Med. Virol. 9:57-68, 1982)
discloses an assay based on nucleic acid hybridization
which detects and quantitates HBV in serum, using the
complete HBV genome as probe.U.S. 4,562,159 discloses a method and test kit
for the detection of HBV by DNA hybridization using
cloned, genomic HBV DNA as a probe.Commonly owned U.S. 4,868,105 describes a
solution phase nucleic acid sandwich hybridization assay
in which analyte nucleic acid is first hybridized in
solution to a labeling probe set and to a capturing probe
set in a first vessel. The probe-analyte complex is then
transferred to a second vessel that contains a solid-phase-immobilized
probe that is substantially
complementary to a segment cf the capturing probes. The
segments hybridize to the immobilized probe, thus
removing the complex from solution. Having the analyze
in the form of an immobilized complex facilitates
subsequent separation steps in the assay. Ultimately,
single stranded segments of the labeling probe set are
hybridized to labeled probes, thus permitting the
analyte-containing complex to be detected via a signal
generated directly or indirectly
