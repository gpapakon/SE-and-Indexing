<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an
optical scanning display using an optical switching
element which can control an electric signal by light and
which can be applied to various devices using optical signals
in the fields of optical communications, information
processing, etc. An optical scanning display of the present invention
can be utilized in the fields of AV
(audiovisual) devices and equipments such as televisions or
games, OA (office automation) devices and equipments such as
personal computers or word processors, and optical information
processing as optical modulator or as optical operator.It is general that wiring resistance and stray capacitance
cause a delay in signal waveform when a drive signal is
transmitted through electric lines. To solve these issues, a
desired display is of an optical scanning type, which transmits
a drive signal with light.Fig. 10 is a plan view to show the structure of an optical
scanning active-matrix liquid crystal display as described in
Japanese Patent Application No. 3-263947 filed by the present
applicant prior to this application. Fig. 11 is a cross section of an element as seen along G-G'
line in Fig. 10.There are a plurality of optical waveguides Y1, Y2,..., Yn
aligned in the vertical direction on one of substrates
constituting a liquid crystal panel. Also, a plurality of
signal electrodes X1, X2,..., Xm are arranged above the
waveguides in the horizontal direction as intersecting with the
optical waveguides. A switching element 4 of photoconductor is
provided at an intersection between an optical waveguide Yn and
a signal electrode Xm, which is controlled by an optical signal
transmitted from a light-emitting element array 10 through the
optical waveguide Yn. The optical switching element 4 has a
low impedance upon light irradiation, whereby the signal
electrode Xm is electrically connected with a picture element
(pixel) electrode 5. In contrast, the optical switching
element 4 has a high impedance with no light irradiation, so
that the signal electrode Xm and the pixel electrode 5 are kept
in an electrically insulated state. Namely, the above display
is an optical scanning display which drives a liquid crystal 13
of electrooptic medium by utilizing the impedance change of
optical switching element 4 with light being used as scanning
signal.The display needs a back light such as a fluorescent lamp
in the use as transmission display or a projection lamp such as
a metal halide lamp in the use as projection display.
Projected light is modulated in the panel
