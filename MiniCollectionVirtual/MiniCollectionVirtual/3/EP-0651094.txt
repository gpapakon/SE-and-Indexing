<ABSTRACT>
To coat a running material web (2), in particular a paper or board web, devices are known which have a mating roll (1) deflecting the web (2), a doctor blade (3) which can be pressed against the mating roll (1) and a supporting strip (6) which is elastically flexible over its length and supports the doctor blade (3) on its rear side. In a known way, the supporting strip (6) is supported in a holder (7, 8) so as to be capable of movement in the direction towards the mating roll (1), and its supporting edge can be adjusted locally to a different extent over the working width by means of a row of adjusting elements (10). In order to be able to set a uniform application both in the web running direction and also transversely to this in a reproducible fashion, the uniformity of which is also maintained during alterations of the coating weight, the supporting strip (6) is, according to the invention, supported so as to be freely movable in the holder (7, 8) in the direction of the mating roll (1) over an adjusting range. On its rear side it is supported by a profiling strip (9) which can be bent and adjusted in the direction of the mating roll (1), and on whose rear side the adjusting elements (10) engage, and there is arranged between the profiling strip (9) and the supporting strip (6) a pressure hose (11) which extends over the working width.

Device for coating a moving material web (2), in 
particular a paper or board web, having a mating roll (1) 

which preferably deflects the web (2), having a doctor 
blade (3) which can be pressed onto the mating roll (1), 

and having a supporting strip (6) which is resiliently 
flexible over its length, supports the doctor blade (3) 

on its rear side facing away from the mating roll (1) and 
is mounted in a holder (7, 8) so that it can move in the 

direction of the mating roll (1), and whose supporting 
edge can be set locally differently over the working 

width by means of a row of adjusting elements (10), 
characterized in that the supporting strip (6) 


is mounted in the holder (7, 8) such that it can 
move freely in the direction of the mating roll (1) 

over an adjustment range, 
is supported on its rear side by a flexible profiling 
strip (9), which can be displaced towards the 

mating roll (1), and on whose rear side the adjusting 
elements (10) engage, and 
in that a pressure hose (11), which extends over the 
working width, is arranged between the profiling 

strip (9) and the supporting strip (6). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the rear end of the supporting strip (6), which end 

is mounted in the holder (7, 8), has a broadening and at 
least one further pressure hose (13, 14), which presses 

the supporting strip (6) away from the mating roll (1), 
is arranged between the broadening and a front wall of 

the holder (7, 8).
