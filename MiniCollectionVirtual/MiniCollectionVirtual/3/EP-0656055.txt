<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic products by contacting them with a fluid comprised of a pure body or a mixture of pure bodies in supercritical or subcritical states, selected amongst C2-C8 hydrocarbons, preferably C2-C6 hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, nitrogen protoxide and mixtures thereof. Conveniently, the fluid used has lipophilic characteristics which makes possible simultaneous delipidation, at least partially, of the treated plasmatic product. Application to the viral inactivation of plasmatic products, optionally combined with their at least partial delipidation.

A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products, wherein said method includes bringing into contact

said products with a fluid consisting of an elementary body
or a mixture of elementary bodies in a supercritical or

subcritical state, selected from hydrocarbons of C
2
-C
8
,
preferably of C
2
-C
6
, halogenated hydrocarbons, carbon
dioxide, nitrogen monoxide and mixtures thereof.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to claim 1, wherein said method is

carried out using carbon dioxide or nitrogen monoxide as
treatment fluid in a supercritical or subcritical state, at

a temperaure of from 10 to 65°C and at a pression of from Pc
to 10 Pc, Pc being the critical pression of the fluid used

during the whole or a part of the treatment.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to claim 2, wherein the treatment

temperature is of from 30 to 65°C during the whole or a part
of the treatment.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to claim 2 or 3, wherein the working

pression is of from Pc to 5 Pc, during the whole or a part
of the treatment.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to any of claims 1 to 4, wherein the

fluid is selected from bodies or mixture of bodies not
modifying the pH of said products during their treatment.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to any of claims 1 to 5, wherein the

plasmatic products are supplemented with stabilizers of
their constitutive proteins, in particular when temperatures

are higher than 40°C.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to claim 6, wherein said stabilizers are 

sugars, polyalcohols or amino acids, alone or in
combination.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to claim 7, wherein said stabilizers are

selected from the group consisting of sucrose, glucose,
fructose, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, glycocolle, arginine

and lysine.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to claim 7 or 8, wherein at least one

other stabilizer selected from calcium chloride, calcium
gluconate and heparin is further added to the plasmatic

products.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to any of claims 1 to 9, wherein one or

more bodies selected from hydrocarbons of C
9
 or more,
oxygenated organic compounds and nitrogenous organic

compounds are added to the fluid.
A method for the viral inactivation of plasmatic
products according to any of claims 1 to 10 and for

delipidation of said compounds, wherein the fluid in a
supercritical or subcritical state presents a lipophilic

characteristic.
