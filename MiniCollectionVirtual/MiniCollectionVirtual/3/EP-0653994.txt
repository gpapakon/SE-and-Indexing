<ABSTRACT>
A flexible envelope, of fabric, plastic sheet or similar material, is made buyoant by being filled with water of lower salinity than the surrounding medium, and used to lift loads underwater. The lift can be generated in situ by pumping water into the envelope after it has been attached to the load through a hose from the surface , and reduced by either releasing the water from within the envelope or pumping it back to the surface again. By combining these two operations, the lift can be exactly controlled. Several envelopes can be used to lift a single load, and the load itself can be made up of small objects placed in a suitable container by other means. The envelopes may be towed into position, or may be provided with their own means of propulsion.

<DESCRIPTION>
Two methods are commonly used to raise large objects, such as sunken ships, from
the sea bed. Firstly, the object may be lifted directly with cables and a crane mounted on a
suitable vessel. This is open to many objections. For very heavy objects, a large and very
costly lifting vessel must be employed. The cables may tangle if more than one is needed
to sustain the weight. At very great depths, the weight of the steel cables is a significant
part of the total load. Steel cables have little compliance, and so will transmit wave
movements directly to the load, considerably increasing peak stress. These last two problems
can be overcome by using cables made of synthetic fibre with approximately the same density
as water. However, these are costly, and, if they break, the large amount of stored energy can
cause serious accidents.The second lifting method employs air-bags. A balloon is attached to the load, and
air is pumped into it, generating lift equivalent to the water displaced. A variation of this is
the close all the apertures on a wreck, and fill it with air; the wreck itself then acts as its
own balloon. Although it is simple and relatively cheap, this method suffers from being
virtually uncontrollable. Normally, extra lift, over and above the weight in water, is required
to break the object free from the bottom. Once the load starts to move upward, the air in the
balloon expands, further increasing the lift. The rate of ascent therefore increases, until the
load virtually leaps out at the surface. Since the air-bag usually has an open bottom, the air
is often spilled at the surface, so the load descends to the bottom again.There are other problems at very great depths. The air must be pumped down from
the surface at a pressure at least equal to that at the sea bed; hence, powerful pumps and
very heavy pressure hose must be used. Furthermore, the solubility of a gas is proportional
to its partial pressure (Henry's Law), so a considerable proportion of the air actually supplied
will be lost by dissolving in the sea-water.The system proposed seeks to combine the simplicity and cheapness of the air-bag
system with the excellent control of the direct lift method.The problem is solved by a method according to claim 1.An apparatus is also proposed to that purpose according to claim 14. The technique proposed is equivalent to the air-bag method, with the crucial
difference that the air is replaced by fresh water. Depending upon salinity, sea water is
roughly 2% more dense than fresh water; hence, a bag
