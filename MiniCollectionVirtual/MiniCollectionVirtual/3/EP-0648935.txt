<ABSTRACT>
A device for the continuous extraction of a liquid mass from a starting region 11 at a first pressure P1 as far as an arrival region 12 at a second pressure P2 higher than the first pressure, including:     - a transport pipe (16) in communication with this starting region and containing an endless screw (archimedian screw) 17, and a screw-tight compressor having a compression ratio R and including a wall 19 mounted downstream of this pipe and a frustoconical screw 20 integral and coaxial with the endless screw,   - a pressurisation chamber (22), - an inlet pipe (21) connected to the outlet of the screw-type compressor and which, equipped with a valve (23) set to a pressure P3 which is between P1 and R.P1, emerges in the pressurisation chamber, and - an outlet pipe (27) connected to the pressurisation chamber and which, equipped with a valve 28, set to a pressure P4 which lies between P2 and R.P1, emerges in the arrival region 12.
