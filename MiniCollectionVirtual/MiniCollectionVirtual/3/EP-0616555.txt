<ABSTRACT>
A cartridge for holding an analytical sample during a diagnostic assay comprises a panel with a number of adjacent wells in its upper side. The wells have an upper opening and a lower opening, and the lower opening extends to the underside of the panel. A filter membrane extends across the lower openings of the wells so that liquids contained in the wells may be drawn through the filter, thereby concentrating suspended solids near the lower openings of the wells. The panel includes a supporting wall for supporting the panel on a non-integral, external surface, which does not form a part of the panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ASSAY CARTRIDGEFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThis invention relates generally to assay cartridges having a Îµ plurality of aligned adjacent wells which are useful as reaction vessels for performing diagnostic tests in which a solid phase is to be separated from a liquid phase, and is particularly directed to assay cartridges which are adapted so that the liquid phase may be separated from the solid phase by drawing it through a filter o membrane at a lower opening in the wells by means of a pressure differential.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONAssay cartridges which include a plurality of wells for performing diagnostic assays on samples are known. The present invention s relates to a class of cartridges which are generally described in U.S. Patent No. 4,704,255 to Jolley. These cartridges are designed to perform assays of the type described in U.S. Patent No. 4,652,533, also to Jolley. (For purposes of the present disclosure, both of the above patents are incorporated herein by reference and made a part o hereof.)To perform such assays, a sample is inoculated into one or more of the wells in the cartridge. An immunoreactant selected for its ability to bind the analyte of interest is attached to a plurality of water insoluble particles held in a suspended state in reagent liquids. Upon 5 introduction of the suspended particles and liquid into the sample wells, the immunoreactant selectively and/or competitively binds to analyte in the sample. The bottom of each well is covered with a filter membrane designed to retain the suspended particles while permitting liquids to pass through. The particles and any bound o substrate are concentrated by microfiltration, that is, by drawing the liquids by means of a pressure differential through the membrane and into a waste reservoir, which is molded as an integral part of the cartridge. A luminescent labelled material which selectively binds to 

 the immunoreactant and/or the analyte is used to determine whether the analyte is present.Although the assay cartridge described in U.S. Patent No. 4,652,533 has been used in performing assays of this type, there are 5 several drawbacks associated with its manufacture and use. First, because the waste reservoir into which the fluids are drawn forms an integral part of the molded cartridge, the cartridge is difficult and relatively expensive to mold and requires a relatively large investment in tooling and a significant amount of material to manufacture. The o complexity of the molding process also tends to increase yield losses due

CLAIMS
WHAT IS CLAIMED IS:
1 . A cartridge for holding an analytical sample during a diagnostic assay comprising:
5 a panel having an upper side and an underside, said panel having a plurality of wells in its upper side, each well having an upper opening and a lower opening which extends to the underside of the panel, filter means extending across the lower openings of the wells, o and said panel further including support means for supporting the panel on an external surface which is non-integral with the panel such that the underside of the panel, the support means, and the surface define a substantially enclosed sub-panel region when the panel is s placed on the surface, and said panel being adapted to sealingly engage the surface such that when a negative pressure differential is created in the sub-panel region air is drawn through the wells from the upper side of the panel, thereby drawing liquid in the wells into the sub-panel region. o 2. The cartridge of claim 1 wherein the support means comprises a continuous wall adjacent the periphery of the panel, said wall having a substantially flat lower surface adapted to engage a generally flat surface.
3. The cartridge of claim 2 wherein the panel is generally 5 rectangular in shape and wherein the continuous wall projects substantially normally from the underside of the panel.
4. The cartridge of claim 1 wherein the filter means comprises a substantially flat sheet which is affixed to the underside of the panel.
5. A cartridge for holding an analytical sample during a o diagnostic assay comprising: a generally rectangular panel having an upper side and an underside, said panel having a plurality of wells in its upper side, each 


 well having an upper opening and a lower opening which extends to the underside of the panel, filter means extending across the lower openings of the wells, and
5 said panel further including a substantially continuous support wall adjacent the periphery of the panel and projecting substantially normally from the underside of the panel for supporting the panel on a generally flat surface such that the filter means, the support means, and the surface define a substantially enclosed sub-panel region when o the panel is placed on the surface, and said panel being adapted to sealingly engage the surface such that when a negative pressure differential is created in the sub-panel region air is drawn through the wells from the upper side of the panel, thereby drawing liquid in the wells into the sub-panel region. 5 6. An instrument for holding and processing analytical samples during a diagnostic assay comprising: a support surface, a cartridge removably supported on the support surface, said cartridge including o (a) a panel having an upper side and an underside, said panel having a plurality of wells in its upper side, each well having an upper opening and a lower opening which extends to the underside of the panel,
(b) filter means extending across the lower openings 5 of the wells, and
(c) said panel further including support means for supporting the panel on the support surface; said filter means, said support means and said support surface defining a substantially enclosed sub-panel region; and o sealing means interposed between the support means and the support surface for effecting a substantially airtight seal between the support means and the support surface. 


 7. The instrument of claim 6 wherein the support means comprises a continuous wall adjacent the periphery of the panel, said wall having a substantially flat lower surface adapted to engage a generally flat surface. 8. The instrument of claim 7 wherein the panel is generally rectangular in shape and wherein the continuous wall projects substantially normally from the underside of the panel.
9. The instrument of claim 6 wherein the filter means comprises a substantially flat sheet which is affixed to the underside of the panel.
10. The instrument of claim 6 further comprising pump means for reducing the pressure in the sub-panel volume, said pump means being in communication with the sub-panel volume through an opening formed in the support surface, said pump means being adapted to draw fluid in the wells through the filter means by reducing the pressure in the sub-panel region.
1 1. The instrument of claim 6 further comprising locating means on the support surface for fixing the position of the panel on the support surface.
