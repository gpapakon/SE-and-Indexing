<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides mice and mouse cell lines having 
a homozygous or heterozygous deficiency in a gene encoding a 

neurotrophin receptor. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, 
mice and cell lines carry a 
trk
B locus specifically targeted within its 
tyrosine protein kinase sequences. Mice homozygous for this 

mutation express gp95
trk
B
 receptor of unknown function but not 
the high affinity functional g
p145
trk
B
 tyrosine protein kinase 
receptors. This mutation results in multiple CNS and PNS 

neuronal deficiencies and in a postembryonic lethal phenotype. 
Such genetically modified mice are useful in model systems for 

studying human diseases involving neuronal degeneration and 
neuronal cell loss, as well as in screening for genes, proteins, or 

other compounds that may prevent or impede neuronal cell death 
or stimulate neuronal regeneration.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the fields of neurology 
and genetically altered mice. Specifically, the present invention 
relates to mice that are deficient in the normal expression of one or 
more wild-type genes, to mice heterozygous for such a deficiency, 
and to cell lines that are homozygous or heterozygous for this 
deficiency. The functional receptors responsible for mediating the 
trophic properties of the nerve growth factor (NGF) family of 
neurotrophins have been recently identified as members of the trk 
family of tyrosine protein kinases (Barbacid, 1993). Neurotrophins 
are growth factors responsible for development and maintenance 
of neurons. These molecules exert their biological effect through 
high affinity signaling receptors located on the surface of specific 
types of neurons. To date, three different loci, designated trk, trkB and trkC, 
have been identified. See U.S. Serial No. 837,814, filed February 
25, 1992, which is incorporated herein by reference. The product 
of the trk proto-oncogene, a 140 kDa cell surface tyrosine protein 
kinase designated as gp140trk (Martin-Zanca et al., 1989), is the 
high affinity receptor for NGF (Kaplan et al., 1991; Klein et al., 
1991a). The related gp145trkB tyrosine protein kinase (Klein et al., 
1989) serves as the signaling receptor for two related  
 
neurotrophins, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Klein et al., 
1991b; Soppet et al., 1991; Squinto et al., 1991) and 
neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) (Berkemeier et al., 1991, Klein et al., 1992; 
Ip et al., 1992). Finally, gp145trkC, a tyrosine protein kinase 
encoded by the third member of this gene family, trkC, appears to 
be primarily responsible for mediating the trophic properties of 
neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) (Lamballe et al., 1991). This gene may also 
code for additional tyrosine protein kinase isoforms that differ from 
gp145trkC by the presence of a small number of amino acid 
residues within their respective catalytic kinase domains 
(Lamballe et al., submitted for publication). The trkB gene is a large (>100 kbp) and complex locus 
capable of directing the synthesis of multiple transcripts (Klein et al., 
1989; 1990a; Middlemas et al., 1991). Some of these 
transcripts direct the synthesis of the gp145trkB tyrosine protein 
kinase receptor. Other transcripts however, code for a second 
class of trkB receptors that lack a catalytic kinase domain. One of 
these receptors, gp95trkB, is abundantly expressed in adult mouse 
brain (Klein et al., 1990a). Nucleotide sequence analysis of
