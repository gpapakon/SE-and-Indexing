<ABSTRACT>
Organosilicone materials that are "density-matched" 
to hydrocarbon media also act as defoamers in 

hydrocarbon fuel, such as diesel fuel. Specifically, our 
defoamers are described as cross-linked organopolysiloxane-polyoxyalkylenes. 

They are characteristized by being 
slightly soluble or insoluble in water and hydrocarbon 

fuels. By changing the solvent and the method of 
dispersion, different particle size distributions are 

obtained.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to foam control and is
particularly concerned with controlling foaming in
hydrocarbon liquids.There are a number of patents which disclose
specific compositions which reduce or eliminate foam.
For example, EP-A 0 578 423, which is prior art according to
Article 54 (3) EPC, describes a foam control agent comprising
5 to 90 parts by weight of an organopolysiloxane and 5 to 95
parts by weight of a hydrocarbon oil. FR-A 2 313 440 relates
to diorganopolysiloxane in mineral oils consisting of a diorganopolysiloxane,
a lubricating mineral oil and a dispersing
agent solid at ambient temperature.U.S. Patent 5,192,336 discloses that bis-stearamides
act as defoamers by remaining dispersed within
hydrocarbon fuels. This is in contrast to silicone
polyether defoamers of U.S. Patent 4,690,668 and U.S. Patent
3,233,986, which settle out over time because of their
higher density relative to hydrocarbon fuel, often
necessitating periodic agitation to re-disperse them.
Silicone polyethers also tend to be more soluble or
dispersible in water, which is a constant component of
hydrocarbon fuels. In storage tanks, water tends to
coalesce and forms a layer at the bottom of the tank. As
the silicone polyether settles due to gravity effects and
its hydrocarbon insolubility, eventual contact with the
water layer can result in its ultimate absorbtion into that
phase. Thus, it can be irreversibly removed from the fuel
in its entirety.Presently, middle distillate fuels exhibit foaming
during transfer operations, such as filling a vehicle's fuel
tank at a service station. In the processing,
transportation and storage of hydrocarbon liquids, it is
frequently observed that foaming occurs as the liquid is
passed from one vessel to another. For example, as
hydrocarbon fuel is passed into a storage tank, foam may
develop at the surface of the fuel. In many cases, the
extent of foaming is sufficiently significant and persistent
to require a reduction in the passage rate of the liquid 
fuel into the vessel. It is therefore desirable to provide
means for controlling such foaming to permit sustained or
higher rates of passage.Various proposals have been made as solutions for
this problem. One proposal uses silicone additives to
control foaming of various grades of hydrocarbon liquids.
However, a solution for diesel fuels has not been
satisfactorily found.U.S. Patent 3,233,986 deals with siloxane polyoxyalkylene
block copolymers as antifoam agents and discloses a
wide variety of such copolymers to reduce foaming of
