<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to the field of 
pharmaceutical chemistry and provides a stereoselective 
process for preparing β-anomer enriched 2-deoxy-2,2-difluo-D-ribofuranosyl-3,5-hydroxy 
blocked-1-alkyl and aryl 
sulfonate intermediates used in the preparation of known 
anti-cancer and anti-viral nucleoside agents. Processes for preparing anti-cancer and anti-viral 
β-nucleoside agents involve the stereochemical 
inversion of furanose (carbohydrate) intermediates bearing 
a leaving group at the anomeric center. Therefore, when a 
β-anomer nucleoside is the desired product, an α-anomer 
enriched carbohydrate intermediate is preferably used in 
SN2 coupling reactions. The most frequently used coupling intermediate 
is 1-chloro-2-deoxy-3,5-(di-O-p-toluoyl)-α-D-erythropentofuranose, 
which was first prepared by Hofer, 
Chem. Ber., 93, 2777 (1960). This compound is crystalline 
and exists exclusively as an α-anomer. However, coupling 
reactions using Hofer's α-chloro anomer carbohydrate to 
prepare 2-deoxyribofuranosyl nucleosides were non-stereoselective. 
Hubbard, et. al., Nucleic Acids, 12, 6827 
(1984) later studied Hofer's results and found that the α-chloro 
carbohydrate intermediate anomerized in the organic 
solvent used at ambient temperatures to form the 
corresponding β-chloro anomer carbohydrate intermediate. 
Therefore, anomerization was responsible for the non-stereoselective 
nature of Hofer's coupling reaction. 
Hubbard, et. al., evaluated the anomerization of the α-chloro 
carbohydrate in several solvents to find solvents  
 
that would hold the effects of anomerization to a minimum 
so that a high yield of the desired β-nucleoside product 
could be obtained. Besides chloro, alkyl and aryl sulfonyloxys 
represent other types of leaving groups that have been 
evaluated. However, due to the instability of some 2-deoxy-D-erythropentofuranosyl 
sulfonate intermediates, 
carbohydrates that contain sulfonyloxy leaving groups are 
conspicuously absent from the chemical literature and are 
rarely used in coupling. U.S. Patents 4,526,988 and 4,965,374 teach 
coupling reactions that employ anomeric mixtures of 2-deoxy-2,2-difluoro-D-ribofuranosyl-1-alkyl 
and aryl 
sulfonate intermediates to make 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoronucleosides 
(see also Synthesis 1992, 565-70). As a consequence of using anomeric 
mixtures, these processes are non-stereoselective for β-anomer 
nucleosides and provide a 1:1 and 4:1 α to β anomer 
ratio respectively, of 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoronucleosides. A method for making an
