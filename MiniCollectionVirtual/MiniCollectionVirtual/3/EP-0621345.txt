<ABSTRACT>
The process for heat-treating workpieces in a vacuum furnace is described, wherein, by altering the positioning of the material arranged in the vacuum furnace, the streams of heating gas and/or cooling gas are directed, at least during part of the heating-up phase and/or cooling-down phase, to varying regions of the workpieces, which are to be subjected to the heat treatment, and these workpieces are used as variable turbulence generators.
