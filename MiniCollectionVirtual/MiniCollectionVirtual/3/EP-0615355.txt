<ABSTRACT>
A received signal (S
R
) of a control channel of each 
cell is despread by each spreading code in a correlation 

detector (22). The received level of the despread output in a 
window, including its peak, is measured in a level 

measuring part and an interference signal level outside 
the window is also measured. In a control part (25) the 

difference or ratio between the measured received level 
and the interference signal level is obtained as a 

comparison signal for each spreading code, and the 
comparison signal is compared in terms of magnitude to 

thereby determine the visited cell of a mobile station (20).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mobile
station or mobile terminal equipment of a CDMA (Code
Division Multiplex Access) mobile communication system
which transmits information spectrum-spread by a
spreading code and uses a different spreading code to
establish a different channel and, more particularly, to
a visited cell selecting arrangement and a cell selecting
method for the CDMA mobile communication system.In a cellular mobile communication system in
which a plurality of cells make up a service area, a base
station optimum for communication changes every moment as
the mobile station moves or travels. It is therefore
necessary, in the mobile communication system, to
properly select the base station optimum for
communication (i.e. a base station belonging to the cell
where the mobile station is currently located) each time
the mobile station moves from a certain cell to the
adjoining one. This is called a cell determination (or
cell selection) and the system which performs
communication through a base station selected by such a
cell determination is referred to as a cellular system.
The cellular system could be implemented using FDMA
(Frequency Division Multiplex Access), TDMA (Time
Division Multiplex) and CDMA (Code Division Multiplex
Access) techniques. In any case, each cell is assigned a
plurality of communication channels and at least one
control channel.Whether the cell selected as mentioned above is
optimum or not has a great influence on the channel (or 
system) capacity, the channel quality and so forth. That
is, in the event that a cell distant from the mobile
station is selected erroneously, both the mobile station
and the base station will transmit with power greater
than needed when the optimum cell is selected. This
increases interference with other stations, wherein the
signal to interference signal ratio diminishes, resulting
in the channel quality being degraded. Furthermore, the
increase in interference causes a decrease in the number
of mobile stations that are allowed to communicate
simultaneously, and hence reduces the channel capacity.A description will be given of a cell selecting
or determining method used in the conventional cellular
system.The base station of each cell always transmits
via the control channel a paging message, the
configuration of the control channel, base station
identifying information, etc. to the mobile station.
Being turned-on, the mobile station sequentially searches
control channels listed in its storage corresponding to
respective base stations and
