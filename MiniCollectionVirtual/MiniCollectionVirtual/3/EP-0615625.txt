<ABSTRACT>
A therapy device comprises identification and destruction means consisting of an array transducers (numbered for example from 0 to 120), and an acoustic signal transmitting and receiving circuit incorporating means for memorising and time reversal of acquired signals, and iteration means for the transmission/reception/reversal sequencing. The identification and destruction means also comprise means for determining maximum signal levels received after an odd number of iterations. The device is used in therapy for the destruction of a target such as stones in tissues, particularly in the kidneys, gall bladder, bladder or urethra, or a tumor.
