<ABSTRACT>
A housing designed to accommodate a plurality of removable 
electrical devices includes power connectors mounted within the housing 

for connecting a power source to each of the devices. In order to 
prevent a user from inadvertently contacting live connectors within the 

housing, the housing is provided with one or more safety elements e.g. in 
the form of fins fixed in the cavity which are positioned to lie between 

adjacent devices. The position, size and location of the pins are 
strategically chosen to prevent access to the connector(s). The position 

of the fins between the devices allows the user access to the devices to 
load and unload them into and from the housing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to housings for electrical 
apparatus and more specifically to a housing incorporating a safety 
structure for preventing an operator from accidentally contacting 
hazardous sources of electrical energy within the housing. A current trend in the design of electrical and electronic systems 
is to modular system configurations wherein individual electrical units 
of the system are readily accessible and in some cases customer 
removable. The use of modular designs provides a number of different 
advantages. Manufacture and assembly is made simpler in that each unit 
can be manufactured and tested separately before being assembled in the 
complete system. Furthermore, if a removable unit becomes defective, it 
can be readily removed for repair and replaced with a working device. A 
typical multi-component system of this type is a data processing system 
in which data storage devices, processing hardware, power supplies and 
cooling fans are contained within a single housing. Typically, the 
removable data storage devices will be mounted within a first compartment 
of the housing which is separated by an internal bulkhead from a second 
compartment in which are located the processing hardware, power supplies 
etc. Provision of power and control signals to each of the devices is 
effected via connectors mounted in the bulkhead which mate with one or 
more connectors at the rear of each device. It is a legal requirement of such systems to provide safety 
protection in order to prevent a system operator from accidentally coming 
into contact with hazardous electrical sources (e.g. exposed voltages) 
within the housing. In a system housing of the type described above 
including internal power connectors, it is necessary to ensure that the 
high energy connector pins are not accessible to the operator's fingers. 
This requirement can be directly achieved either by providing the power 
connector with a shroud or recessing the pins in the connector, thereby 
rendering the pins inaccessible. Alternatively the problem can be 
avoided by designing the connector with female contacts. However in many 
situations it will not be practicable for reasons of space or economy to 
provide either connector shrouding or female power connectors. In these 
situations alternative solutions are needed. One known solution is to provide a removable grill structure at the 
front of the housing and in front of the electrical units which protects  
 
the operator from accidental contact with the

<CLAIMS>
A housing for accommodating a plurality of electrical devices (30) 
removably mountable in a cavity defined within the housing via an opening 

at one side of the housing, the housing including a plurality of 
internally mounted power connectors (40) for connecting each of the 

devices to a power source, the power connectors being positioned at a 
side of the housing cavity opposite the opening to mate with a 

corresponding connector on each device, the housing being characterised 
by the inclusion of finger access prevention means for preventing an 

operator from accessing said power connectors via the opening, said 
access prevention means comprising one or more elements (50) mounted in 

or on the housing and positioned between adjacent ones of the plurality 
of electrical devices so that the removal of the devices is not impeded. 
A housing as claimed in claim 1, wherein each of said one or more 
access prevention elements takes the form of a fin element (50) attached 

to an inner surface of the cavity, the fin extending into the cavity at 
an inter-device position. 
A housing as claimed in claim 2, further including a plurality of 
guide rails (20) attached inside the housing cavity and extending from a 

position at or near the opening towards the power connectors, each of the 
plurality of devices being mountable via one side thereof onto at least 

one of the guide rails, wherein each of said one or more fin elements is 
fixed to a guide rail and extends perpendicularly therefrom. 
Electrical apparatus comprising: 
   a plurality of electrical devices; 

   a housing as claimed in any preceding claim in which the electrical 
devices are mounted.
