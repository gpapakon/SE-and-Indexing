<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (10) is provided for measuring the 
excess carrier lifetime in a semiconductor material, such 

as an HgCdTe wafer (MCT). The apparatus includes a 
computer controller (56) which automates the functions of 

the apparatus, including the operation of the shutter (28) 
to control the time the testing samples are exposed to the 

excitation energy from a laser (14), the laser energy 
intensity on the sample, the position of the wafer 

controlled by the computer controller operating a 
motorized sample positioner (39) and maintaining the 

temperature of the sample. Multiple samples are taken by 
the apparatus which are averaged and analyzed to result in 

a characterization of the carrier lifetime.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for measuring 
the excess carrier lifetime in a semiconductor, 
specifically HgCdTe wafers.  Measurement of the excess carrier lifetime is 
extremely important in characterizing and prescreening 
semiconductor materials. In the past, this measurement 
was often done by a contact technique, attaching 
electrodes directly to the semiconductor material being 
tested. A much better technique has more recently been 
used with noncontact lifetime characterization apparatus. The current noncontact characterization apparatus in 
use are very large and complex devices. It takes a 
skilled operator to operate them correctly and they are 
slow and cumbersome in operation. A need therefore exists 
for an improved apparatus for measuring excess carrier 
lifetime characteristics which overcome the complexity and 
slowness of the prior designs.  In accordance with one aspect of the present 
invention, an apparatus is provided for measurement of 
excess carrier lifetime of a semiconductor material. The 
apparatus includes a first source of energy to excite the 
excess carriers in the semiconductor material. A second 
source of energy is used to measure the conductance of the 
semiconductor material. A computer controller is provided 
which functions to automatically expose the semiconductor 
material to the first source of energy to cause a 
predetermined quantity of energy to be transferred to the 
semiconductor. The computer controller further functions 
to monitor the change in conductance of the semiconductor 
material, analyze the change, and calculate the excess 
carrier lifetime of the semiconductor material.  For a more complete understanding of the present 
invention and for further advantages thereof, reference is 
now made to the following description, taken in 
conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which: 
FIGURE 1 is a schematic view of an apparatus forming 
the first embodiment of the present invention; FIGURE 2 is a side view of the apparatus; FIGURE 3 is a schematic view of the apparatus 
illustrating the electronics used; FIGURE 4 is a schematic of the detector bias circuit; FIGURE 5 is a representative data graph showing data 
collected and analyzed by the apparatus; FIGURE 6 is a representative log data graph showing 
the data; and FIGURE 7 is an exploded view of a four sample holder. With reference now to the accompanying figures, 
wherein like reference numerals designate like 
corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is
