<ABSTRACT>
A fluid-operated tool has link means (1) provided
with an engaging element (3) for engaging and turning a

threaded connector about a pivot axis (A), a housing (5),
and fluid-operated drive means (8,9). The drive means (8,9)

includes cylinder-piston means with cylinder means (11,14)
formed in the housing, piston means (12,15) reciprocatingly

movable in the cylinder means (11,14) and piston rod means
(13,16) connecting the piston means (12,15) and the link

means (1) so that when the drive means (8,9) is actuated by
a pressure fluid, the piston rod (13,16) is displaced and

turns the link means (1) about the pivot axis (A). The
housing (5) is connected to the link means (1) exclusively

by the piston rod means (13, 16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fluid-operated tool for
tightening or loosening a threaded connector.Fluid-operated tools are well known and widely used
in industry. If a space in which to apply the tool is
narrow, limited clearance fluid-operated tools can be
utilized. These limited clearance tools have links which
carry a threaded connector engaging element and which are
connected with the tool housing to be turned by a drive
arranged in the housing. In order to obtain the desired
torque accuracy during tightening and loosening, it is
important that the housing pivots around an axis of the
engaging element or the threaded connector engaged by it.
For this purpose, the housing of known tools is provided
with side plates and the links, which usually include two
drive plates and a ratchet pivotable in them, is sandwiched
between the side plates. The side plates can either be a
part of the housing or be steadily connected to the housing.
With this known construction the total thickness of the side
plates, the drive plates and the ratchet is quite
substantial, and in many applications the space required
above a nut threaded on a bolt or a stud is less than this
thickness. Therefore, these known fluid-operated tools
cannot enter such spaces and cannot operate in these
conditions.US-A-2,972,918 and US-A-3,706,244 each disclose prior
art fluid-operated tools for tightening or loosening
threaded connectors. Both these prior art tools operate
with a single cylinder-piston unit. US-A- 2,729,997 discloses
a fluid-operated tool according to the preamble of claim 1.It is an aim of the present invention to provide a
fluid-operated tool which avoids the disadvantages of the
prior art. In keeping with these objects and with others which
will become apparent hereinafter there is provided a fluid-operated
tool as claimed in the ensuing claim 1.When a fluid-operated tool is designed in accordance
with the present invention, with the housing means connected
to the link means exclusively through the piston rod means
of the drive means, side plates are dispensed with and
thereby the total thickness of an engaging part of the tool,
including only the link means and a ratchet or the like, is
substantially reduced. Thus the engaging part of the tool
can be introduced into substantially narrower spaces. The
fluid-operated cylinder-piston means includes two cylinder-piston
units.Preferably the fluid-operated cylinder-piston means
has two cylinders, two pistons each reciprocatingly movable
in a respective one of the cylinders and

<CLAIMS>
A fluid-operated tool for tightening or loosening a threaded
connector, comprising link means (1) turnable about a pivot axis (A) and

provided with an engaging element (3) for engaging and turning the threaded
connector; housing means (5); and fluid-operated drive means (8) including

cylinder-piston means (9,10) with cylinder means (11,14) formed in said housing
means (5), piston means (12,15) reciprocatingly movable in said cylinder means

(11,14) and piston rod means (13,16) connected with said piston means (12,15)
and with said link means (1) so that, when said drive means (8) is actuated by a

pressure fluid, said piston rod means (13,16) is displaced and turns said link
means communicating about said pivot axis (A), said housing means (5) being connected with

said link means communicating only by said piston rod means (13,16), wherein said cylinder-piston
means includes two cylinder-piston units (9,10), said cylinder means

includes two cylinders (11,14) provided in said cylinder-piston units, said piston
means includes two pistons (12,15) reciprocatingly movable in said cylinders

(11,14), and said piston rod means includes two piston rods (13,16) connected
with said pistons (12,15) and with said link means (1) at two pivot points (B,C)

which are radially spaced from said pivot axis (A) so that, in response to a
displacement of said piston rods (13,16), the pivot points (B,C) of said link means

communicating are turned about said pivot axis (A) by the same angle, 
characterised in that

said pivot points (B,C) are also radially spaced from one another and 
in that
 the
tool further comprises communicating means (18,19)

adapted so that said cylinders are in fluid communication with one
another to enable pressure fluid to flow from one of said cylinders (11) into the other

of said cylinders (14) during actuation of said drive means (8)
.
A fluid-operated tool according to claim 1, further comprising
reaction means (21) for counteracting a reaction force generated during the

displacement of said piston rods (13,16), said reaction means (21) being pivotably
connected (at D,E) with said cylinders (11,14).
A fluid-operated tool according to claim 1, wherein said
cylinders of said cylinder-piston units are pivotably connected with one another.
A fluid-operated tool according to claim 1, wherein at least one
of said piston rods (13) has two portions (13',13") pivotably connected with one

another, one of said portions (13') being connected with a corresponding one of 
said pistons (12) and the other of said p
ortions (13") being pivotally connected
with said link means (1).
