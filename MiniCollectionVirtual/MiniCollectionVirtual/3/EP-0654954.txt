<ABSTRACT>
Selectively compressing the signal supplied to 
a loudspeaker (200, 695) based upon the volume setting 

for the sound level to be produced by the loudspeaker 
(200, 695) improves the intelligibility of human speech 

produced by a loudspeaker (200, 695) at high volume 
levels. Compression of the signal to the loudspeaker 

(200, 695) prevents the loudspeaker (200, 695) from 
overloading. The level of compression may be adjusted 

based upon the volume setting. The amplitude of an audio 
signal (655) sent to a loudspeaker (200, 695) may be 

increased if below a preselected pivot point (906) and 
increased if above the pivot point (906). The amount of 

increase or decrease in the amplitude may be proportional 
to the difference between the amplitude of the audio 

signal and the pivot point (906). This difference may 
also be raised to the power of a shape factor to 

determine the amount of increase or decrease in the 
amplitude of the audio signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
the field of audio systems which include a loudspeaker.
The present invention is particularly applicable for
use in the field of mobile communications and more
particularly cellular speakerphones for use in high
ambient noise environments such as an automobile.For reasons of safety and convenience,
cellular radiotelephones often provide hands-free
operation. By using a loudspeaker and external
microphone the drivers of automobiles may engage in
telephone conversations without having to take their
hands from the steering wheel. A conventional hands-free
system is illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1
illustrates, a radiotelephone 130 connected to a remote
loudspeaker 110 and a microphone 120 located within an
automobile (represented by the box 100). Often, the
volume of the loudspeaker 110 must be turned up quite
loud for the driver to be able to hear the caller over
ambient noise such as the noise of the engine, wind and
road. Radiotelephones 130 still commonly use a moving
coil loudspeaker 110. In fact, radiotelephones often
have the loudspeaker placed in the handset of the
radiotelephone, thereby restricting the size of the
loudspeaker 110 to the space available in the handset.Figure 2 represents a cross-sectional
schematic view of a moving coil loudspeaker. A
flexible edge suspension 220 and a flexible center
suspension 230 freely suspend a diaphragm element 270
in an open frame housing 290. The diaphragm 270 is 
nominally conical in shape. The diaphragm 270 is
mechanically coupled to a voice coil 240 which is
situated around a permanent magnet 280. Electrical
audio signals (i.e., alternating currents of varying
frequency and amplitude) are coupled to the coil 240
via a pair of wires 250.The alternating currents of the electrical
audio signals coupled to the coil 240 give rise to
magnetic fields oriented either parallel or anti-parallel
to the magnetic field of the permanent magnet
280. The orientation of the magnetic fields depends
upon the direction of current flow through the coil
240. The magnetic fields created by the alternating
currents in the coil 240 establish either forces of
attraction or repulsion with respect to the magnetic
field of the permanent magnet 280. Because of the
mechanical coupling between the coil 240 and the
diaphragm 270 and the freedom of movement of the
diaphragm in the plane parallel to the forces created
by parallel or anti-parallel magnetic fields (i.e.
perpendicular to plane 215), changes in the direction
and amplitude of the
