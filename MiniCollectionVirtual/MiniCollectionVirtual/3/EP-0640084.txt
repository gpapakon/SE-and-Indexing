<DESCRIPTION>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION6-AMINO SUBSTITUTED IMIDAZ0[4,5-b]PYRIDINES ASANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONISTSSUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONThis is a continuation-in-part of copending application Serial No. 516,286 filed May 4, 1990 which is a continuation-in-part application of copending application Serial No. 358,971 filed May 30, 1989, now abandoned.This invention relates to novel compounds of structural formula I which are angiotensin II (All) antagonists that inhibit the binding of All to the AT^ and A 2 receptor sites, useful in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and elevated intraocular pressure.It also relates to processes for preparing the novel compounds; pharmaceutical formulations comprising one or more of the compounds as active ingredient; and, a method of treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and elevated intraocular pressure. 

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONRenin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a central role in the regulation of normal blood pressure and seems to be critically involved in hypertension development and maintenance as well as congestive heart failure. Angiotensin II (All), an octapeptide hormone is produced mainly in the blood during the cleavage of angiotensin I by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) localized on the endothelium of blood vessels of lung, kidney, and many other organs, and is the end product of the RAS. All is a powerful arterial vasoconstricter that exerts its action by interacting with specific receptors present on cell membranes. One of the possible modes of controlling the RAS is angiotensin II receptor antagonism. Several peptide analogs of A II are known to inhibit the effect of this hormone by competitively blocking the receptors, but their experimental and clinical applications have been limited by the partial agonist activity and lack of oral absorption [M. Antonaccio. Clin. Exp. H pertens. A4, 27-46 (1982); D. H. P. Streeten and G. H. Anderson, Jr, - Handbook of Hypertension, Clinical Pharmacology of Antihypertensive Drugs, ed. A. E. Doyle, Vol. 5, pp. 246-271, Elsevier Science Publisher, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 1984] .Recently, several non-peptide compounds have been described as A II antagonists. Illustrative of such compounds are those disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,207,324; 4,340,598; 4,576,958; 4,582,847; and 4,880,804; in European Patent Applications 028,834; 245,637; 253,310; and 291,969; and in articles by A.T. Chiu, et al. fEur. J. Pharm. Exp. Therap. 157. 13-21
