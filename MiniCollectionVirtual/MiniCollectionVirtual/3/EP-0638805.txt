<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a device and a process for detecting 
an analyte in a biological fluid. The device comprises a separating matrix 

for separating analyte from the fluid and means for detecting the analyte. 
where the separating matrix contains HEPES buffer, preferably in an amount 

between 70 and 150 millimolar. The process comprises applying the sample 
to the device having a separating matrix and then detecting analyte in the 

sample using the detection means. The presence of HEPES in the separation 
layer shortened the detection time.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device and a process for detecting
an analytes in a biological fluid. A device comprises a separating matrix for
separating an analyte from a sample fluid, where the separating matrix
contains HEPES buffer. A process comprises applying a sample fluid to a
device having a separating matrix and then detecting an analyte in the sample
using detection means in a detection layer adjacent to the separating matrix.There is a need in the end point detection art for devices and
methods that allow for the rapid, accurate determination of analyte (e.g.,
glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol, etc.) concentration in very small sample
volumes of biological fluid. The need for a device using small sample
volumes is particularly relevant to the detection of blood glucose because of
the difficulty and inconvenience of obtaining blood samples from subjects.Currently available such devices include ACCUCHEK EASY TEST
STRIPS™ and ACCUTREND⊙ (Boehringer Mannheim Corp.). Those
devices are multilayer reagent systems characterized by the absence of a
buffering agent in the separation or filtration layer.Buffer is commonly added to the composition present in a detection
layer for the purpose of controlling the pH of the reagent composition
present in said layer. The use of buffers for this purpose is described, for
example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,116,763.EP 239 926 describes a rainbow test device which shows
different colors dependent on the concentration of the
analyte. EP 511 120 describes a multilayer test device
having special openings fo the exchange of air. The present invention provides a detection device having a HEPES-impregnated
separation matrix, which HEPES serves to reduce the time
needed for analyte detection. Unexpectedly, HEPES speeds up the end point
determination in the detection layer. Other buffers do not demonstrate the
same benefit.In one aspect, the present invention contemplates a device for
detecting an analyte in a biological fluid sample, which device comprises:
a) a separation matrix containing HEPES; andb) means for detecting an analyte, which detection means is
vertically adjacent to the separation matrix and substantially coincident with
that matrix such that analyte can move from the separation matrix to the
detection means.The amount of HEPES present is between 70 and 150 millimolar and
preferably between 80 and 100 millimolar.A detection means is preferably a matrix containing chemical reagents
that interact with the analyte to generate a detectable signal. A
