<ABSTRACT>
A battery charger is provided which automatically controls the charging process independent of individual battery construction or temperature. Control of the charging process is achieved by periodically interrupting the charging current, determining resistance-free voltage of the battery in fixed intervals after interruptions of current, and comparing the resistance-free voltage with a reference voltage. Reference voltage is automatically determined for each recharging subject by analyzing the change in resistance-free voltage with respect to time during an initial, constant current period to locate certain characteristic points indicative of the onset of overcharge. The charging current is reduced as necessary, so that the resistance-free voltage does not exceed the reference voltage and significant overcharge is avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an improved charging device for rechargeable
batteries and cells.More particularly, this invention relates to an improved battery charger
capable of very rapid and "gentle" charging of batteries without causing overcharge
and overcharge-related effects such as battery overheating or shortening of cycle life.Specifically, this invention relates to an improved battery charger
which is capable of automatically determining a reference voltage and controlling
the charging cycle accordingly to avoid overcharge.Control of the charging process is achieved by periodically interrupting
the charging current, determining resistance free voltage Vo of the battery in fixed
intervals after interruptions of current, and comparing the resistance-free voltage
with a reference voltage VREF characteristic of the onset of overcharge reactions. 
The charging current is reduced as necessary, so that the resistance-free voltage does
not exceed the reference voltage.The reference voltage characteristic of the onset of overcharge
reactions is determined during a constant current period of charging by determining
the resistance free voltage Vo of certain characteristic data points. The
characteristic data points may be located on a charging curve, which relates
resistance-free voltage Vo to time t. With reference to FIG. 2, the characteristic
points are:
1) the first inflection point I(1) of the charging curve Vo(t), where
the first derivative dVo/dt has a minimum,2) the point K of maximum curvature of the charging curve, also
identified as the inflection point on the first derivative curve
(dVo/dt), where the second derivative d2Vo/dt2 curve has a
maximum,3) the second inflection point I(2) on the charging curve, where
the first derivative dVo/dt has a maximum.A suitable VREF is chosen as a function of either one, or a weighted
average of two or more of the above characteristic points. For example, VREF may be
computed by increasing values for VI(1) by a certain percentage, or by decreasing
values for Vk or VI(2) by certain percentage.The rechargeable batteries and cells relevant to the present invention
are of the type using nickel-cadmium (NiCd), nickel-metal hydride (NiMeH), lead-acid
and other chemistries. These are used in various applications ranging from
small appliances like shavers, cordless power-tools, portable telephones, computers,
toys, etc; as well as traction batteries for forklift trucks, golf carts and electric 
vehicles.With the expected increase in reliance on electric vehicles,
