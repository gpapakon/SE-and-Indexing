<ABSTRACT>
The invention is directed to a stent having varying thickness, with the thickness selected based at least in part on the flexing characteristics of the particular portion of the stent. The stent is formed with a pattern having flexing and stable portions, with the flexing portions contributing to stent flexibility during stent positioning and deployment. One or more flexing portions are provided with a nominal thickness, and at least some stable portions are provided with a greater-than-nominal thickness. The resulting stent has excellent flexibility, strength, and radiopacity characteristics. The stent may be formed using various approaches, including using a tubular member, flat sheet, or wire.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to devices for the treatment of heart disease and
particularly to endo-arterial prostheses, which are commonly called stents. More
particularly, the invention relates to stents having variable thickness.Several interventional treatment modalities are presently used for heart
disease, including balloon and laser angioplasty, atherectomy, and by-pass surgery.
In typical coronary balloon angioplasty procedures, a guiding catheter having a
distal tip is percutaneously introduced through the femoral artery into the
cardiovascular system of a patient using a conventional Seldinger technique and
advanced within the cardiovascular system until the distal tip of the guiding catheter
is seated in the ostium of a coronary artery. A guidewire is positioned within an
inner lumen of a dilatation catheter and then both are advanced through the guiding
catheter to the distal end thereof. The guidewire is first advanced, out of the distal
end of the guiding catheter into the patient's coronary vasculature until the distal
end of the guidewire crosses a lesion to be dilated, then the dilatation catheter
having an inflatable balloon on the distal portion thereof is advanced into the
patient's coronary anatomy over the previously introduced guidewire until the
balloon of the dilatation catheter is properly positioned across the lesion. Once in
position across the lesion, the balloon is inflated to compress the plaque of the
lesion against the inside of the artery wall and to otherwise expand the inner lumen
of the artery. The balloon is then deflated so that blood flow can be resumed
through the dilated artery and the dilatation catheter can be removed therefrom.
Further details of dilatation catheters, guidewires, and devices associated therewith
for angioplasty procedures can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,071 (Simpson-Robert);
U.S. Pat. No. 4,439,185 (Lindquist); U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,972 (Samson);
U.S. Pat. No. 4,538,622 (Sarnson, et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,929 (Samson, et al.); 
U.S. Pat. No. 4,616,652 (Simpson); U.S. Pat. No. 4,638,805 (Powell); U.S. Pat.
No. 4,748,982 (Horzewski, et al.); U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,768 (Lau, et al.); U.S. Pat.
No. 5,451,233 (Yock); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,651 (Klemm, et.al.).One problem that can occur during balloon angioplasty procedures is the
formation of intimal flaps which can collapse and occlude the artery when the
balloon is deflated at the end of the angioplasty procedure. Another problem
characteristic of balloon angioplasty procedures is the large number

A stent (10) for deployment in a body lumen, the stent
(10) comprising:


a generally tubular member defined by a plurality of
radially expandable cylindrical elements (14) disposed

generally coaxially and interconnected by links (16),
each cylindrical element (14) having a circumferential
undulating pattern including a series of curved portions

(28, 30, 32) at opposite axial ends of the element (14)
which are joined by bars (34),
the curved portions (28, 30, 32) being adapted to
deform when the stent (10) is expanded from a delivery

condition to a deployed condition and the links (16) and
bars (34) being adapted to not so deform,

   
characterised in that
 one or more of the curved
portions (28, 30, 32) of one of said cylindrical elements

(14) has a nominal thickness (42) and one or more of the
links (16) and bars (34) of the same cylindrical element

(14) has a greater-than-nominal thickness (48).
The stent (10) of claim 1, wherein the nominal
thickness (42) is 80% or less of the greater-than-nominal

thickness (48).
The stent (10) of claim 2, wherein the nominal
thickness (42) is 50% or less of the greater-than-nominal

thickness (48).
The stent (10) of claim 3, wherein the nominal
thickness (42) is 10% or less of the greater-than-nominal

thickness (48). 
The stent (10) of claim 1, wherein the curved portions
(28, 30, 32), links (16) and bars (34) are formed from the

same material.
