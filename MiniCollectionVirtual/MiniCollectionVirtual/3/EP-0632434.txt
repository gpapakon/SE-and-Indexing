<ABSTRACT>
An internal drum plotter including apparatus for mounting 
a recording substrate in a generally cylindrical configuration 

about a longitudinal axis, a multi-beam light source assembly (14) 
disposed at a first location along the longitudinal axis, and 

including a plurality of light sources (16) which are separated from 
each other along an axis (18) perpendicular to the longitudinal axis (12), 

light directing apparatus operative to direct light received from 
the multi-beam light source assembly to the recording substrate 

and apparatus for transmitting light from said multi-beam light 
source assembly to said light directing apparatus substantially 

without inaccuracies which are functions of the period of rotation 
of the light directing apparatus about the longitudinal 

axis.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to internal drum plotters
generally and more particularly to multi-beam internal drum
plotters.Various types of multi-beam internal drum plotters are
known in the art. An example of such plotters appears in European
Patent 0307095.Generally speaking, the prior art plotters have limited
accuracy due to wobble and cross-scan errors as the result of
inaccuracies in the manufacture and mounting of a derotating
element which is employed to prevent beam crossing under rotation
and in the apparatus for rotating the derotating element. The present invention seeks to provide an improved
internal drum plotter which overcomes the inaccuracies
mentioned above.Accordingly, there is provided in one aspect of the
invention an internal drum plotter including apparatus
for mounting a recording substrate in a generally
cylindrical configuration about a longitudinal axis;
a multi-beam light source assembly disposed at a
first location along the longitudinal axis, and including
a plurality of light sources which are separated from
each other along an axis perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis;light directing apparatus operative to direct light
received from the multi-beam light source assembly to the
recording substrate; andapparatus for transmitting light from said multi-beam
light source assembly to said light directing
apparatus including image rotating apparatus disposed
along the longitudinal axis and characterised by;detector apparatus for sensing inaccuracies in light
transmission to the light directing apparatus and
feedback apparatus responsive to the sensed inaccuracies
for correcting the relative orientations of at least one
of the multi-beam assembly, the light directing
apparatus, and the apparatus for transmitting light, in
order to remove the sensed inaccuracies.In a second aspect the invention provides an
internal drum plotter including apparatus for mounting a
recording substrate in a generally cylindrical
configuration about a longitudinal axis;a multi-beam light source assembly disposed at a
first location along the longitudinal axis, and including
a plurality of light sources which are separated from
each other along an axis perpendicular to the
longitudinal axis; light directing apparatus operative to direct light
received from the multi-beam light source assembly to the
recording substrate; andapparatus for transmitting light from said multi-beam
light source assembly to said light directing
apparatus including image rotating apparatus disposed
along the longitudinal
