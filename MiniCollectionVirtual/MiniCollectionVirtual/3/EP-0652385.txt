<ABSTRACT>
A synchronizer clutch assembly for a manual 
transmission comprising a synchronizer hub carried by 

a torque delivery shaft (10) and including a cone clutch 
member (72) carried by a gear (12,14) forming a part of the 

transmission gearing and a synchronizer blocker ring (38,38') 
adapted to be made of forged steel, the synchronizer 

assembly including a shiftable clutch sleeve (28) that is 
engageable with at least one spring element (54,54') secured to 

the synchronizer blocker ring (38,38') whereby the blocker ring 
cone clutch frictionally engages the cone clutch of 

the gear upon movement of the sleeve (28) toward an 
engagement position until the rotary motion of the 

gear (12,14) is brought into synchronism with the rotary 
motion of the shaft (10).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to automotive
transmissions and to synchronizer clutches for
controlling ratio changes in transmission gearing.Synchronizer clutch assemblies for manual
transmissions typically include an intermediate torque
transfer shaft situated between a torque input shaft
and a transmission torque output shaft. Located in
parallel disposition with respect to the intermediate 
shaft is a cluster gear assembly. Torque delivery
gears of different pitch diameter may be journalled on
the intermediate shaft, and a synchronizer clutch
assembly is disposed adjacent one of the gears or
between two adjacent gears. The synchronizer clutch
assembly functions to drivably connect the torque
delivery gears for rotation in unison or to connect
one or both of the gears selectively to the
intermediate shaft. The synchronizer clutch assembly
synchronizes rotary motion of the gears, one with
respect to the other, or rotary motion of one or both
of the gears selectively with respect to the
intermediate shaft prior to the establishment of a
driving connection between the rotary members.US-A-2221900 discloses a synchronizer clutch
having a synchronizer clutch hub that is splined to
the intermediate shaft at a location between two gears
of different pitch diameter. A clutch sleeve with
internal clutch teeth is mounted for axial sliding
movement on the synchronizer hub. The gear to be
synchronized with respect to the shaft carries
external clutch teeth as well as an external clutch
surface. A synchronizer clutch blocker ring of that
prior art design is disposed between the sleeve and
the external clutch teeth of the gear. The blocker
ring is formed with an internal cone surface adapted
to engage the external cone surface of the gear.Thrust bars arranged within the sleeve of
the prior art designs are engageable with the
synchronizer ring when the clutch sleeve is moved
toward the engaged position. A detent force created
by detent elements on the thrust bars and the clutch
sleeve creates a synchronizer blocker ring clutch 
engaging force that causes the blocker ring to index
angularly with respect to the clutch hub. This
indexing motion is established by a lost motion
connection between the blocker ring and the clutch
hub.Chamfered external blocker ring teeth formed
on the blocker ring are in axial alignment with
chamfered ends on the internal clutch sleeve teeth.
When the chamfered ends on the teeth of the blocker
ring and the sleeve engage, a clutch engaging force is
established that causes synchronism in the

<CLAIMS>
A synchroniser clutch assembly for a manual transmission
comprising torque transfer gears (12,14), a torque delivery shaft (10), at least one

of said gears (12,14) being journaled for rotation about the axis of said shaft (10);

said clutch assembly comprising a clutch hub (18) secured to said
shaft (10), a clutch sleeve (28) secured to said hub (18) and adapted for axial

shifting movement relative to said hub (18);
a blocker ring (38,38';92) between said one gear (14,12) and said
hub (18), clutch teeth (26,44) on said sleeve (28) and on said one gear (14,12),

blocker ring gear teeth (40,40') between said sleeve clutch teeth (26) and gear
clutch teeth (44), said blocker ring (38,38';92) and said one gear (14,12) having

engagable friction clutch surfaces (36); and
at least one spring element (54,54';54") secured to said blocker ring
(38,38') including a flexible portion (58) adapted to engage said sleeve teeth (26)

as said sleeve (28) is moved toward said blocker ring gear teeth (40,40'), whereby
a clutch surface engaging force is developed on said blocker ring (38,38') upon

deflection of the or each spring element (54;54');

   characterised in that

   the flexible portion (58) of the or each spring element (54;54';54")
is attached to a portion which abuts against an axial face of the blocker ring

(38,38';92), and has a free end (90) which is guided by cooperation with the
