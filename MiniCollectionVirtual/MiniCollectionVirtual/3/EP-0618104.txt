<ABSTRACT>
Foreseen on a truck frame a second frame (2) with bearing plates, 
front (3) and back (4), of a dump body fitting with pistons front (8) and 

back (9). Said pistons (8 and 9) permit the tippings of the dump body 
both back and sides. For the back tipping the couple of overturning pins 

is positioned into seats of the dump body, so blocking the hinge the 
same dump body over the back bearing plate (4), then the pneumatic cocks 

of the hydraulic plant are started. For the side tipping one of the pin 
is taken out from one seat relating to the hoisting side desired, and 

said pin is inserted into one of the front seats.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to a trilateral tipping system for dump bodies 
of trucks which permits to select the starting, in the back tipping, 
of one of the two pistons and in the side one of both the automatic 
hoisting pistons by means of a device which permits the hinged 
pin fitting up into the front bearing plate right or left of the 
dump body. Current are known three different kinds of dump body 
tipping: a back tipping, by means of one or more pistons foreseen 
in front position, a bilateral tipping, with one or more pistons 
longitudinally placed, and a trilateral tipping by means of one 
or more pistons with longitudinal placing, almost central, and 
with simultaneous driving supported on a oscillating ring system 
for the inclination variability. This last system permits an use 
versatility but the central placing of the hoistingpistons involves 
the necessity to foresee dump bodies with high resistance and weight. 
Moreover said hoisting piston central placing brings to need, in 
the particular long dump bodies, of pistons of high dimensions 
and consequently it needs of a frame very high. The invented system 
realizes jointly the back tipping, by means of a hoisting piston 
front longitudinal placed, and the bi-side tipping, using two or 
more pistons positioning in lenght, by means of a new hoisting system  
 
where in the back tipping acts only one piston while in the side 
tippings act both or all the pistons. In comparison with the current 
system, using pistons with simultaneous action, the invented system 
foresees the under cited advantages to be particularly noted in 
the trucks with big dimension and capacity: a) the resistence 
structure of the tipping dump body has a shape more easy and light 
such, on the longitudinal section, it foresees two support points 
good positioned both during the side tipping, where both the pistons 
are acting, than during the back tipping where only the front 
piston acts with back hinge bearing; b) it is permited to realize 
bigger dump bodies so to optimize the thrust points that the invented 
means permits; c) the optimal position of the thrust points makes 
better also the vehicle stability during the tipping; d) the less 
hoisting stress permits to use a lower pression into the oildynamic 
circuit; e) to contain at the minimum the height of the tipping 
plane also when, corresponding to the dump body central area, 
the truck frame does not permit the piston housing such the longer 
front piston is displaced forward in an area where the frame has 
not

<CLAIMS>
Trilateral tipping dump body foreseen two pistons with selected 
intervention mounted on truck frame (1) foreseen a second frame 

(2) with bearing plates front transversal (3) and back transversal 
(4) for the dump body (5), oscillating ring devices (6 and 7) bearing 

the pistons front (8) and back (9) and for the hoisting of the 
dump body (5) a hydraulic device, characterized by that to hoist 

the dump body (5) is acted on the pneumatic cocks (15) sending 
oil under pressure to the front piston (8) and at the same time 

to the back piston (9) if the deflector (13) is activated by the 
pneumatic cock (14) which takes the overturning pin position; for 

the back tipping the couple of overturning pins (16) is positioned 
into the seats (17 and 18) of the dump body frame, so blocking 

at hinge the same dump body over the back bearing plate (4), and 
it is started the pneumatic cocks (15) of the hydraulic plant; 

for the side tipping one of the pin (16) is taken out from its 
seat (17 or 18) and said pin (16) is inserted into one of the front 

seats (19 or 20); to make this a rod (21) is rotated which drives 
the pneumatic cock (14) so moving the connection, through deflector 

(13), of the back piston (9) from the oil tank (10) to the hydraulic 
distributor (12) where comes the oil under pressure by the hydraulic 

pump (11). 
Trilateral tipping dump body foreseen two pistons with selected 
intervention, according to claim 1), in that the the hydraulic 

device consists of an oil tank (10), a group foreseen the truck 
drive shaft and the hydraulic pump (11), a pneumatic drive hydraulic 

distributor (12), a pneumatic drive deflector (13), a pneumatic 
cock (14) and a group of pneumatic cocks (15).
