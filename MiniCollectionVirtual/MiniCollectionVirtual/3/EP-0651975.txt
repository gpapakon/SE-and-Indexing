<ABSTRACT>
There is described a complete tooth implant assembly which comprises a dental root implant (10), a superstructure adapter (20) and a superstructure (30). The superstructure (30) is releasably connected to the dental root implant (10) via the adapter (20). For this purpose, a conical sleeve is provided on the head of the dental root implant and at the bottom of the superstructure. The adapter (20) essentially comprises two plug-in cones which project away from one another and can be brought into a releasable seating in the conical sleeves. In order to increase the compatibility of the implant, the two plug-in cones of the superstructure adapter (20) are connected to one another via a transition piece which widens from the attachment point of the upper plug-in cone to the attachment point of the lower plug-in cone. This counters bacterial infiltration because the pressure upon the gingiva surrounding the transition piece after implantation increases from the top to the bottom. In order to avoid metallosis, the superstructure (30) is to be secured on the adapter (20) in such a way that a free-flowing, curable material, for example PMMA, is injected into an annular channel (70) formed after assembly.

Total tooth replacement implant comprising a tooth root implant (10), a
suprastructure adapter (20) and a suprastructure (30), wherein the

suprastructure (30) can be releasably connected to the tooth root implant
(10) by means of the adapter (20) and in each case a conical socket (11; 33)

is provided in the head of the tooth root implant (10) and at the bottom of
the suprastructure (30), in which the adapter (20) comprises essentially two

insert cones (21, 23) projecting away from one another and which can be
introduced into a releasable seat using the conical sockets (11, 33),

characterised in that both insert cones (21, 23) are connected to one another
by a transition piece (26), and in that the transition piece (26) expands from

the shoulder of the occlusal insert cone (23) towards the shoulder of the
apical insert cone (21).
Total tooth replacement implant according to claim 1, characterised in
that the transition piece (26) expands continuously.
Total tooth replacement implant according to claim 1 or 2, in which an
inner polyhedron (12), into which a collar in the form of an external

polyhedron (22) moulded onto the base of the second insert cone (21) of the
adapter (20) to produce the connection with the tooth root implant (10) can

be placed with simultaneous production of the conical clamping connection
between adapter (20) and tooth root implant (10), is designed on the upper

region of the conical fitted socket (11) in the tooth root implant (10).
Total tooth replacement implant according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that an inner polyhedron (32), into which a collar in the

form of an external polyhedron (27) moulded onto the base of the first insert
cone (23) of the adapter (20) to produce the connection with the

suprastructure (30) can be placed with simultaneous production of the
releasable seat between adapter (20) and suprastructure (30), is also

designed in the lower region of the conical fitted socket (33).
Total tooth replacement implant according to claim 3 or 4, in which the
inner polyhedron (12, 32) is designed as an inner octahedron and the

external polyhedron (22, 27) as an external octahedron.
