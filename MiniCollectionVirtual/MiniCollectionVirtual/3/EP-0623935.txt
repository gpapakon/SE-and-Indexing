<DESCRIPTION>
The invention of this application is directed to conductive 
compositions, more specifically to polyoxymethylene (POM) 
homopolymer compositions containing conductive carbon fibers. 
Such compositions are suitable for use in combination with piezoelectric 
materials which can be put to various end-uses, among these, 
in making triggers for portable cigarette lighters. Ignition or spark is created in many portable lighters today through 
friction. There are now also lighters available in which ignition is 
created through pressure applied to a piezoelectric material. One 
type of such lighters is commercially available from BIC Corporation 
under the name "BIC Electronic". The composition of this invention is 
particularly suitable for preparing triggers for such lighters. POM homopolymers are known to be excellent insulating materials. 
Attempts have been made to produce a conductive composition 
containing these homopolymers, but so far such compositions have 
had various drawbacks including instability, undesirable processing 
properties and insufficient conductivity. It is an object of this invention to produce conductive POM 
homopolymer compositions which avoid the drawbacks of the 
heretofore known compositions. More specifically, it is an object of 
this invention to provide a POM homopolymer composition 
possessing good conductivity while simultaneously being sufficiently 
stable and having good mechanical properties for moulding, 
extruding and other processing techniques and whose properties 
meet the requirements of the particular end-use. The invention of this application is particularly directed to a 
conductive POM homopolymer composition comprising a POM  
 
homopolymer and 15-20% by weight of conductive carbon fibers, 
weight percents given herein being based on the overall weight of 
the composition. The composition preferably will contain further components common 
to POM compositions, including heat stabilizing agents, lubricating 
agents, coloring agents and anti-oxidants
 
As used herein, the terms have the following meanings. Polyoxyethylene (POM) homopolymers refers to a known class of 
compounds including homopolymers of formaldehyde, the terminal 
groups of which are end-capped by esterification. The POM 
homopolymer is linear and preferably has a number average 
molecular weight in the range of 10,000 to 80,000, more preferably 
from 35,000 to 45,000 The molecular weight of the POM can be 
conveniently measured by gel permeation chromatography in 
hexafluorisopropanol at about
