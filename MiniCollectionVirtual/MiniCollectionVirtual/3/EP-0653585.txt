storage unit (3) at a higher pressure relative to the 
pressure container (19), 


in which the pressure container (19) is connected 
with a pressure-tight connection line (14) onto a delivery 

device (5) connected to the storage unit (3), 
in which the environmental temperature (T
u
) prior to 
filling is measured and a temperature corrected permissible 

filling pressure (p
z
) is determined on the basis 
of a preset temperature-pressure characteristic for 

pressure containers, 
in which a small quantity of gas is supplied to the 
pressure container (19) in order to bring about a pressure 

compensation between the delivery device (5) and 
the pressure container (19), 
in which the initial pressure (p
0
) of the pressure 
container (19) is measured in the delivery device (5), 
in which a specific mass of gas (m
b

the pressure container (19), and 
in which the pressure (p
1
) of the pressure container 
(19) is measured in the delivery device (5) after the 

mass flow has been interrupted, 
 
characterised in that 


the pressure container (19) is filled to the permissible 
filling pressure (p
z
); 
in that a mathematical relationship between mass (m) 
and pressure (p) is calculated from the specific mass 

of gas (m
b
) and from the measured pressure values (p
0
, 
p
1
);  
 
in that a first additional mass of gas (m
z1
) is calculated 
in such a way, with the aid of an extrapolation 

of the mathematical relationship, that at least one 
further additional mass of gas (m

the filling of the pressure container to a filling 

pressure (p
z
), 
in that the first additional mass of gas (m
z1
) is 
supplied to the pressure container (19), the mass flow 

is subsequently interrupted and the pressure (p
2
) of 
the pressure container (19) is measured; 
in that the first additional mass of gas (m
z1

in the calculation of the mathematical relationship in 

order to improve the reliability of the extrapolation,

mass of gas (m
zi
) by extrapolation of the mathematical 
relationship, the supply of a further additional 

mass of gas (m
zi
) into the pressure container 
(19) and the subsequent measurement of the pressure 

(p
i
) is repeated more than once, 
either until the permissible filling pressure (p
z
) in 
the pressure container (19) is achieved, 
or until a further additional mass of gas (m
zi
) is 
calculated by extrapolation of the mathematical relationship 

which permits an increase of the filling pressure 
to the permissible filling pressure (p
z
) to be expected, 
and 
in that the filling procedure is terminated as soon 
as this further additional mass of gas (m
zi
) has been 
filled into the container.

rise (ΔT) of the gas to be expected in the pressure 

container (19) is computed; and in that based on a 
preset temperature-pressure characteristic for pressure 

containers a corrected permissible filling pressure 
(P

during the filling time (t
f

arises as a result of the thermal dissipation of the

permissible filling pressure (P

preset temperature pressure characteristic of pressure
