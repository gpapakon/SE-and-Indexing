<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a polyester
film for use as a film to be laminated on a metal
plate. More specifically, it relates to a polyester
film for preparing a metal plate laminated therewith,
which exhibits excellent moldability during the deep-drawing
of a metal plate laminated with the film in the
step of making cans, and which has excellent take-up
properties and enables the production of cans, e.g.,
beverage cans and food cans, of a metal plate laminated
with the film excellent in heat resistance, resistance
to embrittlement under retort treatment, flavor and
taste retaining property and impact resistance.Inner and outer surfaces of metal cans generally
have coatings for the protection against corrosion.
For simplifying the manufacturing step, improving
the sanitary condition and preventing the environmental
pollution, however, there have been recently
developed methods of imparting rustproof properties to
metal cans without using any organic solvent. One of
the methods is to coat metal cans with a film of a
thermoplastic resin. That is, studies have been being
made of a method in which a plate of tin-plated steel,
tin-free steel or aluminum is laminated with a film of
a thermoplastic resin and the resultant laminate is
deep-drawn to make cans. Attempts have been made to
use a polyolefin film or a polyamide film as the above
film of a thermoplastic resin, but not all of
moldability, heat resistance, flavor retaining property
and impact resistance are satisfied.On the other hand, a polyester film, or a
polyethylene terephthalate film in particular, is
drawing attention as one having well-balanced properties,
and several proposals have been made to use it as
a base film as follows. 
(A) A metal plate is laminated with a biaxially
oriented polyethylene terephthalate film through
an adhesive layer of a polyester having a low melting
point, and the resultant laminate is used as a material
for making cans (see Japanese Laid-open Patent Publications
Nos. 10,451/1981 and 192,546/1989).(B) A metal plate is laminated with a film of
an aromatic polyester having amorphous nature or very
low crystallinity, and the resultant laminate is used
as a material for making cans (see Japanese Laid-open
Patent Publications Nos. 192,545/1989 and 57,339/1990).(C) A metal plate is laminated with a heat-set,
biaxially oriented polyethylene terephthalate film
having a low orientation degree, and the resultant
laminate is used as a material for making cans (see
Japanese Laid-open Patent Publication No.
