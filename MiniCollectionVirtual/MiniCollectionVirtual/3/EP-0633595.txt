<ABSTRACT>
A process for fabricating a pixelized phosphor 
having a space between the pixels in the range of about 

0.5-25 microns, the process comprising the steps of: 

(a) depositing a phosphor on a support; 
(b) exposing the deposited phosphor to a source 
of electromagnetic radiation through a mask thereby 

ablating the phosphor segmentally, resulting in a 
series of structures in both said X and Y directions to 

produce an array of pixelized phosphors separated by 
slots; 
(c) filling the resulting slots between the 
pixelized phosphors with phosphor material of the same 

or different composition as utilized in step (a) such 
that each of the pixelized phosphors on the support are 

separated by a width of from about 0.5-25 microns; and 
(d) optionally, planarizing the pixelized 
phosphors.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for the 
fabrication of a phosphor and more particularly, it 
relates to a process for the fabrication of a pixelized 
or cellularized phosphor. In the field of X-ray detection it is well-known 
to employ so-called intensifying screens to increase 
the radiation available for detection purposes. Such 
screens contain an X-ray luminescent material which is 
selected to emit a relatively large number of light 
photons for each X-ray photon striking the material. 
This effectively amplifies the X-rays to be detected 
since both the X-rays themselves and light emitted by 
X-ray-induced emission from the luminescent material 
are available for detection on film or other detection 
mediums or devices, such as arrays of light-sensitive 
electronic sensors. The primary incentive to use such 
intensifying screens in medical applications is to 
reduce the amount of X-ray radiation which is required 
to produce a given exposure, thereby reducing the 
radiation risk to which a patient or operator is 
exposed. It is known that such intensifying screens, while 
increasing the amount of radiation available for 
detection, also have the effect of reducing the 
sharpness of the resultant image. In general, image 
distortion in luminescent screens or structures is 
caused by the diffusion of light within the luminescent 
material which causes a blurring of the image with 
consequent loss of definition and contrast. This  
 
diffusion of light is brought about by two fundamental 
physical processes. First, as the ionizing radiation 
is converted into light, the direction of emission of 
light is random so that it is emitted approximately 
equally in all directions. The second effect is that 
the high energy radiation is penetrating, the degree of 
penetration being dependent upon the energy of the 
impinging radiation and the nature of the material 
being penetrated. The higher the energy, the deeper 
the penetration. A lower density material will also 
lead to a deeper penetration. Thus, it is seen that as visible light is 
generated along a path through the screen and normal to 
its surface, light will be radiating in all directions. 
Some of the light radiated at an angle off the normal 
to the surface of the screen will reach the film or 
other detecting means and result in a diffuse image. As a result, the design of such intensifying 
screens has involved a trade-off between screens of 
large thickness, which result in increased luminescent 
radiation for a given X-ray level, but
