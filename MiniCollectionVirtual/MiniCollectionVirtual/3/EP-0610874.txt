<ABSTRACT>
If a hot-water heating installation breaks down due to defect or is replaced by a new installation in the case of modernisation, this leads to a relatively long downtime of the heating installation, which may involve considerable inconvenience to the persons concerned. This is avoided by a mobile heating installation which is transported to the place of use and connected to the stationary heating system. The mobile heating installation contains a heat exchanger (3), so that the heating water used in the mobile heating installation does not mix with the heating water of the stationary heating installation, with the result that corrosion problems are avoided. The mobile heating installation additionally contains a hot-water apparatus (2), by means of which the hot-water supply can be maintained.
