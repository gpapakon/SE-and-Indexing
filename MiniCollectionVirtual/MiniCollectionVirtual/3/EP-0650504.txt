<ABSTRACT>
In a process for producing a flame-resistant, pourable, latently reactive, phenolicly curable epoxy resin molding material for encapsulating electronics components, a latently reactive prepolymer epoxy resin mixture in powder form and with no iosocyanate groups is produced from a filler-containing thermally polymerizable reaction resin mixture of polyepoxy resin, consisting of a mixture of bi- or multifunctional epoxy resins, and polyisocyanate resin, with a molar ratio of epoxy groups to isocyanate groups of 
>
 1 - with substituted imidazole as reaction accelerator at a concentration of 0.5-2.5 % relative to polyepoxy resin - at reaction temperatures of up to 200  C, and the prepolymer epoxy resin mixture is mixed with a powered, filler-containing phenolic resin mixture, with a molar ratio of epoxy groups to phenolic hydroxyl groups of 1:0.4 - 1:1.1, if necessary with additives.
