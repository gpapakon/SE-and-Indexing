<ABSTRACT>
Undenatured whey protein concentrate is administered to HIV-seropositive individuals to elevate their blood mononuclear cells, glutathione (GSH) level, body weight and sense of well being. In addition T-helper cells concentration and their T-helper cells/T-suppressor cells ratio are slightly elevated.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to the use of an essentially undenatured whey protein
concentrate for the production of a medicament for the treatment of HIV-seropositive
individuals. In particular the present invention considers the use of such concentrate in an
amount sufficient to elevate the T-helper cell concentration and the T-helper cell-T-suppressor
cell ratio in an HIV-seropositive individual. Reference is made to twelve articles listed at
the end of this specification, the contents of which are
incorporated by reference herein.Our studies showed that the humoral immune
response (number of plague-forming cells formed in
response to sheep red blood cells) is significantly
higher in mice fed a 20g whey protein concentrate/100 g
diet than in mice fed formula diets of similar
nutritional efficiency containing 20g/100 diet of any
other type of commercially available semipurified food
protein, such as casein, soy, wheat, corn, egg white,
fish, beef protein, Spirulina maxima, Scenedesmus algae
protein, or Purina mouse chow [1].We have further shown that the immunoenhancing
activity of dietary whey protein concentrate (WPC) is
related to greater production of splenic glutathione
(GSH) in the whey protein-fed animals during the oxygen-requiring
antigen-driven clonal expansion of the
lymphocyte [2]. It was then theorized that this might
reflect the ability of the lymphocytes of whey protein
diet-fed mice to offset potential oxidative damage, thus
responding more fully to the antigenic challenge [3,4].
In fact, the capacity of a cell to recover from an
oxidative insult is considered to be represented by its 
ability to regenerate intracellular stores of
glutathione [5].Our studies also showed that administration of S-(n-butyl)
homocysteine sulfoximine, which reduces
splenic glutathione in half, significantly reduced the
humoral immune response of whey protein-fed mice. This
was taken as further evidence for the important role of
glutathione in the immunoenhancing effect of dietary
whey protein [2].Tissue glutathione concentration may be
increased by administration of gamma-glutamyl-cysteine.
Glutathione increased in the kidney by about 50%, 40-60
minutes after subcutaneous (s.c.) injection in mice,
returning to control values 2 hours later [6]. The
administered gamma-glutamylcysteine is transported
intact and serves as a substrate for glutathione
synthetase [7].Advances in amino acid sequencing of food
proteins allowed us to investigate the occurrence of
glutamylcysteine groups in whey protein and the
