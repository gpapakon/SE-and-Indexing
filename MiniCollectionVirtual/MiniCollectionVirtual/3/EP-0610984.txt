<ABSTRACT>
A video system, for example an X-ray examination apparatus, comprises a 
variable gain video amplifier (20). The gain is varied by a control circuit (40), 
via
 a 
control input (23), so that the amplitude of the amplified signal (Vu) is as independent 

as possible from the amplitude of the input signal (Vi). The value of the control signal 
is derived from the ratio of a reference value (Vref) to the amplitude of the amplified 

video signal (Vu). This amplitude is measured in a detector (30) which supplies an 
amplitude signal (Vd) as input for the control circuit. By combining this ratio with the 

already adjusted gain (K), stored in a memory (47), practically instant adaptation of the 
gain is possible when the amplitude (Vi) of the input signal changes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a video system with automatic gain control,
comprising
a variable gain video amplifier, comprising a signal input, a signal output and a
control input,a detector, an input of which is coupled to the signal output of the video amplifier in
order to determine the level of the output signal of the video amplifier,a control circuit, an input of which is coupled to an output of the detector and an
output of which is coupled to said control input in order to apply a control signal to the
video amplifier.
A video system of this kind, comprising automatic gain control via feedback, is used to
obtain a video image of constant brightness, for example the mean or peak brightness in
the event of a varying intensity of the video signal applied to the input of the amplifier,
for example due to variation of illumination of or absorption in an object observed by
means of the video system.A video system of this kind is known from DE-A 39 25 329. Therein, a
circuit for a video system is described in which the output signal of a video camera is
amplified by means of a controllable amplifier. The amplified signal charges a first
capacitor via a system of switches and a rectifier. The charge across the first capacitor
is transferred, via a further switch, to a second capacitor which is connected to a first
input of a differential amplifier. It is thus achieved that the voltage across the second
capacitor represents the current value of the brightness obtained for the brightness
control. The second input of the differential amplifier receives a reference voltage. The
output signal of the differential amplifier is used to control the gain of the video
amplifier.In the known video system, the gain of the video amplifier is varied by an
amount which is proportional to the difference between the actual brightness and the
reference value. When the mean brightness of the video signal presented to the video
amplifier changes, to begin with the gain is then changed by a value which is 
proportional to the change of the amplitude of the video signal. It is only subsequently
that via the feedback the gain is readjusted until the desired level of the output signal is
obtained again. Consequently, the adjusted brightness is reached only in the course of
time and, in the event of large level variations of the video signal, a damped oscillating
level of the output signal may occur.It is inter alia an object of the invention to provide a video system in
which the period of time required to reach the adjusted
