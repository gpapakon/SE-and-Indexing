<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to prophylactic and/or 
therapeutic compositions for the treatment of hypofunction 
of organs, particularly hypofunction caused by surgery or 
on or transplant of the organ, the composition comprising a 
pharmacological carrier containing an effective amount of 
compounds having antagonistic activity on endothelin 
receptors. Endothelin (ET) is a vasoconstrictive peptide composed 
of 21 amino acid residues. Endothelin was isolated from 
the culture supernatant of the endothelial cells of porcine 
aortas. Its structure was determined by M. Yanagisawa et 
al. in 1988 [M. Yanagisawa et al., Nature332, 411-412 
(1988)]. More recently, the research on genes coding for 
endothelin has revealed the presence of three kinds of 
peptides similar to endothelin in structure. These 
peptides are named endothelin-1 (ET-1), endothelin-2 (ET-2) 
and endothelin-3 (ET-3), respectively. Further, the 
research has revealed that the endothelin receptors invivo 
include two types, A and B. Since the discovery of endothelin, compounds having 
antagonistic activity on endothelin receptors have been 
intensively searched in order to develop drugs for treating  
 
the following diseases resulting from endothelin. As a 
result, the compounds having antagonistic activity on 
endothelin receptors are proposed in Japanese Patent 
Application Nos. 4-344252, 4-216019, 4-27785 and 3-503831, 
EP-A-436,189, EP-A-457,195, EP-A-510,526, WO92/12991, 
Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication No. 4-288099, EP-A-496,452, 
EP-A-526,708, EP-A-460,679 and WO92/20706. The 
compounds described in these patents are suggested to be 
effective as therapeutic drugs for hypertension, cardiac or 
cerebral circulatory diseases, renal diseases and asthma, 
anti-inflammatory drugs, antarthritics and the like. On the other hand, the endothelin concentration in 
organs such as the liver is known to increase in surgery of 
the organs [Nippon Ishoku Gakkai Zasshi27 (1992)]. The 
recent research has revealed that monoclonal antibodies to 
endothelin have the action of preventing hypofunction of 
organs on which operations are conducted. However, it is 
neither described at all nor suggested that the compounds 
having antagonistic activity on endothelin receptors are 
useful as prophylactic and/or therapeutic drugs for 
hypofunction of organs in their surgery or transplant. It is therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide prophylactic and/or therapeutic drugs for 
hypofunction of organs in their surgery or transplant 
comp
