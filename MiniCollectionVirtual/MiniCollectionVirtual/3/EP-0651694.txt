<ABSTRACT>
A process for the simultaneous drying and crystallisation of crystallisable thermoplastic synthetic material (plastic), e.g. polyethylene terephthalate, in which plastic from the melt is extruded in cord form, solidified at the surface by quenching in water and crystallised by gas treatment and dried, using a device for cooling and drying the cord emerging from dies having a casting gutter with its acceptance end arranged beneath the dies and a device producing a flow of coolant on the casting gutter within a quenching section, a subsequent dewatering section in which the casting gutter has apertures for the free flow of the coolant, a subsequent drying section in which the casting gutter has closely spaced nozzles for the passage of gas and a granulator downstream of the drying section. The lengths of the quenching, dewatering and drying sections must be such, taking account of the rate of creep of the cord along the casting gutter, that the passage time in the quenching section is a maximum of some 1.5 seconds to attain a cord surface temperature of at least 100  DEG C, in the dewatering section at most some 0.1 second and in the drying section at most about 20 seconds for crystallisation, with the surface temperature at the end of the quenching section largely maintained.

Process for the simultaneous drying and crystallization of 
crystallizable thermoplastic synthetic (plastics) material, 

for example polyethylene terephthalate, in which plastic 
from the melt is extruded in strands, solidified at the 

surface by quenching in water, and crystallized and dried 
by treatment with gas, using a device for cooling and 

drying the strands (26) that emerge from nozzles (6), the 
said device comprising a run-out launder (8) with its inlet 

end positioned beneath the nozzles (6) and a device over 
the run-out launder (8) that produces a flow of coolant 

within a quenching section (A), a subsequent dewatering 
section (E) in which the run-out launder (8) has apertures 

(20) to allow free drainage of the coolant, a subsequent 
drying section (T) in which the run-out launder (8) has 

closely spaced nozzles (30) for the passage of gas, and a 
granulator (13) downstream from the drying section (T), 


characterized in that
 having regard to the speed with which 
the strands (26) flow along the run-out launder (8), the 

lengths of the quenching section (A), the dewatering 
section (E) and the drying section (T) are chosen such that 

the passage time through the quenching section (A) is at 
most approximately 1.5 seconds to attain a surface 

temperature of the strands (26) of at least 100Â°C, the 
passage time through the dewatering section (E) is at most 

approximately 0.1 second, and the passage time through the 
drying section (T) is at most approximately 20 seconds to 

allow crystallization, with the surface temperature at the 
end of the quenching section (A) largely maintained. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that in the 
dewatering section (E), once the coolant has drained away 

the strands (26) are exposed to an air-stream which dries 
them.  

 
Process according to Claims 1 or 2, characterized in that 
in the granulator (13) downstream from the drying section 

(T), the strands (26) are cut up into a granulate. 
Process according to Claim 3, characterized in that the 
surface temperature of the granulate is maintained 

essentially the same as the surface temperature of the 
strands (26) in the area of the drying section (T).
