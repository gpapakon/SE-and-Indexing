<ABSTRACT>
A balustrade handrail entry housing is provided for a 
balustrade having a base (16), a handrail (12), and a 

balustrade panel (14). The balustrade entry housing 
includes a frame (28), a shell (30), a channel (44) 

formed within the frame fro receiving the balustrade 
panel, apparatus (44,56) for clamping the balustrade 

panel in the channel, and a face plate (32;70) having 
apparatus for mounting a safety device (34) for sensing 

obstructions entering the handrail entry housing a round 
the handrail. The frame is independent of the balustrade 

base and the balustrade panel, and therefore may be 
positionally adjusted relative to both. The shell, which 

is independent of the frame mounts, on and is supported 
by the frame. The shell may be positionally adjusted 

relative to the balustrade base and balustrade panel.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to people moving devices in
general, and balustrade handrail entry housings for
people moving devices in particular.Escalators, moving walkways, and other people
moving devices efficiently move a large volume of
pedestrian traffic from one point to another. Passengers
step on moving steps (or belts, treads, or pallets) and
are transported along at a constant rate of speed. For
safety reasons, a passenger handrail is provided on each
side of the steps, travelling in the same direction and
speed as the steps.A balustrade assembly, extending from the entry to
the exit of the people moving device, supports and guides
each handrail.Each balustrade assembly includes a plurality of
balustrade panels (typically glass) which rise up from a
base to support the handrail. Externally, the base
consists of a number of enclosure panels including an
outer decking, an outer cladding, an inner profile, and a
skirt panel. The outer decking and outer cladding enclose
the mechanics on the side of the balustrade panel
opposite the moving steps. The inner profile and skirt
panel enclose the mechanics adjacent the moving steps.The handrails are connected into endless loops which
travel from one end of the device to the other along the
top of the balustrade panels and then return through the
base of the balustrade assembly. At each end of the
balustrade assemblies, the balustrade panels have curved
sections, or "newels", which enable the handrails to
curve down and into the base of the balustrade. The end
of the balustrade where the handrail enters the base and
the end where it exits, depends on which direction the
steps are travelling. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize
that there are two predominant design approaches to the
area of the balustrade base where the handrail enters the
base. In the first approach, a finished end panel is
fixed in a plane perpendicular to the base enclosure
panels described heretofore. Typically a safety device
for sensing obstructions entering the base around the
handrail is fixed to the end panel. In some cases, an
aesthetic shroud is fixed to the end panel above the
safety device to conceal the safety device.A disadvantage of this approach is that the
aesthetic options of the end panel, and possibly the
shroud, are somewhat limited because the end panel
generally must conform to the contour of the base.
Another disadvantage of using the end panel approach is
that each end panel design is unique to the geometry of
the base chosen. Hence, if "x" number of

<CLAIMS>
A balustrade handrail entry housing for a balustrade
having a base (16), a handrail (12), and a balustrade

panel (14) comprising:

a frame (28), independent of said balustrade base
and balustrade panel;
a shell (80,82), independent of said frame, wherein
said shell mounts on and is supported by said frame;
a channel (44), formed within said frame, for
receiving said balustrade panel;
means (46,50)for clamping said balustrade panel in
said channel; and
means (32;70) attached to said frame, for mounting a
safety device (34) for sensing obstructions entering the

handrail entry housing around the handrail.
Housing according to claim 1, wherein said frame
further comprises:


a first half (36), having a clamping surface
(40);and
a second half (38), having a clamping surface (40);

   wherein said first and second halves are attached to
one another by conventional 
fasteners (46) and said
clamping surfaces form said channel (44) for receiving

said balustrade panel (14); and

   wherein the position of each said frame half may be
adjusted relative to said balustrade base (16), relative

to said balustrade panel, and relative to each other.
Housing according to claim 2, wherein said shell
further comprises:


a first half (80) ; and
a second half (82),

   wherein the position of each said shell half may be
adjusted relative to said balustrade base (16), relative 

to said balustrade panel (14), and relative to each
other.
Housing according to any of claims 1 to 3, wherein
said frame (28) is mounted on a floor panel (26) adjacent

the balustrade base (16) and may thereby be positionally
aligned relative to said balustrade base and balustrade

panel.
Housing according to claim 4, wherein said shell
(80,82) said safety device mounting means (32;70), and

said floor panel (26) enclose said frame (28).
Housing according to any preceding claim, wherein
said safety device mounting means (32;70) comprises a

face plate.
