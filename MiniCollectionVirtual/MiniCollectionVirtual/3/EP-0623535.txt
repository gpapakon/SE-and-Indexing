<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for transporting solid masses 
comprises a continuously drivable first conveyor (11), intermittently 

drivable second conveyor (12) and bridge plate (42) 
interconnecting the transport paths of the two conveyors. 

The first conveyor has push bars (23) for pushing out the 
solid mass forward from the terminal end of its transport 

path. The second conveyor has holders (32) and means 
for transporting the holders a distance at a time which 

distance is twice the pitch of the holders. The solid 
mass B is pushed out onto the bridge plate (42), slidingly 

pushed forward on the plate by a main pusher (43) and 
thereby forwardly pushed out from the front end of the 

plate. The bridge plate has a by-pass gate (46), which is 
provided with a movable gate plate (47) for opening and 

closing the gate. While the solid mass is being pushed 
by the main pusher, another solid mass immediately 

following the mass pushed by the pusher is pushed out 
from the first conveyor to a position over the gate by 

a subpusher (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to transport
apparatus for transferring solid masses from one
conveyor to another conveyor for use with filling
machines for dessert, snack food or like material in
the form of solid masses.Apparatus of the type mentioned are known
which comprise a continuously drivable first conveyor
for transporting solid masses at a predetermined
spacing so as to push out each mass forward from the
terminal end of its transport path, a bridge plate so
disposed as to receive the solid mass as pushed out
forward from the first conveyor, a pusher for pushing
the received solid mass forward on the bridge plate
in sliding contact therewith and pushing out the solid
mass forward from the front end of the bridge plate,
and an intermittently drivable second conveyor having
a plurality of holders arranged at a predetermined
spacing in a transport direction, the second conveyor
being so disposed that the solid mass pushed out
forward from the bridge plate is received by the holder
as held at rest at a receiving position. To give an increased transport capacity to
the known apparatus, there arises a need to operate
each of the first and second conveyors at a higher
speed. Although the operating speed of the first
conveyor can be increased without difficult problems,
an increase in the operating speed of the second
conveyor requires a shortened cycle time for the
intermittently driven conveyor. However, this is
limited mechanically and is not easy to accomplish,
consequently limiting the increase in the transport
capacity of the overall apparatus.The main object of the present invention is
to overcome the above problem and to provide a transport
apparatus for solid masses which is given a greatly
increased transport capacity without shortening the
cycle time of the intermittently driven conveyor.The present invention provides an apparatus
for transporting solid masses which comprises a
continuously drivable first conveyor having a transport
path extending forward; an intermittently drivable
second conveyor having a transport path extending
forward from a position in front of the first conveyor,
the second conveyor having a plurality of holders
arranged with a predetermined pitch in a transport 
direction, the second conveyor having means for transporting
the holders a distance twice the pitch of the
holders at a time; a bridge plate so disposed as to
connect the front end of the transport path of the
first conveyor with the front holder of two
holders stopped at the rear end of the transport path

An apparatus for transporting solid masses comprising:

a continuously drivable first conveyor (11) having a
transport path extending forward,
an intermittently drivable second conveyor (12) having a
transport path extending forward from a position in front of the first

conveyor (11), the second conveyor (12) having a plurality of holders
(32) arranged with a predetermined pitch in a transport direction, the

second conveyor (12) having means for transporting the holders (32) a
distance twice the pitch of the holders (32) at a time,
a bridge plate so disposed as to connect the front end
of the transport path of the first conveyor (11) with the front holder

(32) of two holders (32) stopped at the rear end of the transport path
of the second conveyor (12), the bridge plate (41, 42) being provided

with a by-pass gate (46) between front and rear ends thereof,
a movable gate plate (47) for opening and closing the
by-pass gate (46) to connect the by-pass gate with the rear holder

(32) of the two holders (32) stopped at the rear end of the transport
path of the second conveyor (12) when opening the gate (46) and to

become flush with the bridge plate (41, 42) when closing the gate
(46),
a main pusher (43) for slidingly pushing the solid mass
(B) forward on the bridge plate (41, 42) and pushing out the mass

forward from the front end of the bridge plate (41, 42),
a subpusher (44) for forwardly pushing another solid
mass (B) immediately following the solid mass pushed by the main

pusher (43) from the front end of the transport path of the first
conveyor (11) to a position over the by-pass gate (46) while the main

pusher (43) pushes the mass forward, and
opening-closing means for closing the gate plate (47)
when the solid mass pushed by the main pusher (43) passes over the

by-pass gate (46) and opening the gate plate (47) after the passage
and by the time the solid mass pushed by the subpusher (44) reaches

the position over the by-pass gate (46),
 
   wherein the first conveyor (11) comprises a horizontal

slide plate (21) for placing solid masses (B) thereon, a pair of
endless chains (22) arranged on opposite sides of the slide plate (21)

and a plurality of push bars (23) arranged with a predetermined pitch
and connected between the chains (22), and wherein the main pusher

(43) and the subpusher (44) are connected together by a connecting
member (51) and spaced apart by a distance larger than the pitch of

the push bars (23), each of the push bars (23) being operable to push
out the solid mass (B) from the front end of the transport path of the

first conveyor (11) onto the bridge plate (41, 42).
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 wherein the transport
path of the second conveyor (12) is positioned at a level lower than

the level of the transport path of the first conveyor (11) by more
than the height of the solid mass (B), and a chute (45) pivotally

movable upward and downward is provided at the front end of the bridge
plate (41, 42).
An apparatus as defined in claim 1 or 2 wherein each of the
holders (32) is formed by a slat, and a cavity (33) for positioning
