<ABSTRACT>
A sheet material comprises a top layer (20) formed of a non-absorbent, thermally non-conductive thermoplastic material, a stabilizing layer (22) formed of a non-woven material affixed to the top layer, and, in various embodiments, a barrier layer and/or cushioning layer (46) affixed to the stabilizing layer to form a laminate in which the stabilizing layer is sandwiched between the top layer and such other layers. The formulation of the top layer of thermoplasic material can be varied to alter its coefficient of friction or degree of slip resistance depending upon the requirements of a particular application.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to slip-resistant
sheet material, and, more particularly, to a
sheet material comprising a laminate of a non-absorbent,
thermally non-conductive top Layer formed with
apertures, and a stabilizing layer which can be
affixed to at least one other layer such as a barrier
layer and/or a cushioning layer.A large portion of the materials which we
walk on, e.g., insoles of shoes, indoor carpeting,
outdoor carpeting, floor mats, etc., have a basic 
construction which has remained essentially the same
for a number of years. In most instances, such
materials consist essentially of a top layer of
fibrous cloth or fabric material which touches the
foot, and a second layer of backing material connected
to the top layer which, may or may not have cushioning
properties. Despite improvements in certain aspects
of these types of products such as wear life and
comfort, little or no attention has been paid to
characteristics such as slip-resistance and thermal
conductivity.US-A-4223458 discloses a shoe insole which aims to protect
the user from athlete's foot, reduce foot fatigue and absorb foot
odour. It comprises a coarse mesh-like woven cloth as a backing,
a honeycomb-woven cloth, a sheet prepared by coating a latex
containing activated carbon powder, copper powder and magnetic
powder on a non-woven cloth and heat-treating the coated cloth,
and a fine-woven cloth surface layer, the cloths being laminated
in the above order, and welded at a peripheral edge.US-A-4602442 describes a shoe insole which comprises a
reinforcing woven polypropylene net needled to a non-woven fibre
fleece on one side and laminated to a second non-woven fibre
fleece by a polyethylene film on the other side. In the design of insoles for
shoes, and particularly insoles for athletic shoes or
other active wear articles or footwear, an effort has
been made to improve the cushioning characteristics of
such insoles to enhance comfort. But the configuration
and surface characteristics of such insoles have
been ignored as they relate to the ability of the
insole to maintain the foot and sock insulated from
the sole of the article of footwear, and the extent to
which the toot and sock are permitted to move within
the article of footwear.One problem with the sheet materials employed
to fabricate insoles for active wear footwear
involves a failure to control the motion of the sock
of the wearer relative to the insole and/or the motion
of the foot of the wearer with respect to the sock. 
This affects both the comfort and

Laminate sheet material, comprising an outer layer (20)
formed of a slip-resistant, non-conductive thermoplastic

material, the outer layer (20) being formed with a plurality of
wall sections (36, 40) which define apertures (34) therebetween,

characterised in that the sheet material comprises a stabilizing
layer (22) formed of non-woven fibrous material affixed to the

outer layer (20), the stabilizing layer (22) being effective
substantially to reduce movement of the wall sections (36, 40)

of the outer layer (20) relative to one another in response to
the application of a shear force to the outer layer (20).
Sheet material according to Claim 1 wherein a barrier layer
(46, 54) formed of a substantially liquid impervious material is

provided, affixed to the stabilizing layer (22).
Sheet material according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 wherein a
cushioning layer (64, 78) is provided affixed to the stabilizing

layer (22) or to the barrier layer (46, 54) where a barrier layer
is provided, the barrier layer (46, 54) being effective

substantially to prevent bleedthrough of the cushioning layer
(64, 78) into the stabilizing layer (22).
Sheet material according to Claim 1 wherein a first
cushioning layer (64) is provided, affixed to the stabilizing

layer (22), in that a barrier layer (92) is provided, affixed to
the first cushioning layer (64) and in that a second cushioning

layer (98) is provided, affixed to the barrier layer (92), the
barrier layer being effective substantially to prevent

bleedthrough of the second cushioning layer (98) into any of the
other layers.
Sheet material according to Claim 2, 3 or 4 wherein a
barrier layer (46, 54, 92) is provided which includes an

antimicrobial material having bacteriostatic and fungistatic
properties. 
Sheet material according to Claim 3, 4 or 5 comprising at
least one cushioning layer (64) affixed to the stabilizing layer

(22) and formed of a material selected from the group consisting
of latex foam and crosslinked polyethylene foam.
Sheet material according to any one of Claims 3, 4, 5 or
6 comprising at least one cushioning layer (78) affixed to the

barrier layer (46, 54) and not affixed to the stabilizing layer
(22), the at least one cushioning layer (78) being formed of a

polyurethane foam.
Sheet material according to any preceding claim wherein the
outer layer (20) is formed of an ethylene-vinyl acetate

copolymer.
Sheet material according to Claim 8 wherein the ethylene-vinyl
acetate copolymer has a vinyl acetate content between about

3% and 40% by weight.
Sheet material according to any preceding claim wherein the
outer layer (20) further includes a thermoplastic elastomer.
Sheet material according to any preceding claim wherein the
outer layer (20) has between about 7 and 107 apertures per square

centimetre.
Sheet material according to any preceding claim in which
the wall sections (36, 40) of the outer layer (20) are formed in

spaced rows (42) and columns (38) which intersect so that the
apertures (34) are square in shape, and there are between about

1 and 14 columns (38) of wall sections (36) per lineal centimetre
and between about 1 and 14 rows (42) of wall sections (40) per

lineal centimetre.
Sheet material according to any preceding claim wherein the
wall sections (36, 40) of the outer layer (20) are between about

.38 and 3.8 millimetres in height and width. 
Sheet material according to any preceding claim wherein the
non-woven fibrous material forming the stabilizing layer (22) is

selected from the group consisting of polyester, a blend of
polyester and rayon, and a blend of cellulosic fibres and

polyester.
