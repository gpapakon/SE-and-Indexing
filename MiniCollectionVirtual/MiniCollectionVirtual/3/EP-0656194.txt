<ABSTRACT>
The construction of a stand 
for an optical instrument is such 

that a second parallel link (3) can 
expand and contract in longitudinal 

and transverse directions to permit a 
counter weight (W₄) to move along 

a straight line (X) connecting a tip 
end (β₁) of a support arm (9) and a 

pivot point (S). Therefore, it is possible 
to easy and positively balance the 

weight of an operating microscope 
(W₁₋₃) in horizontal and vertical directions 

only by moving the counter 
weight (W₄) along the straight line 

(X).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a stand in which heavy medical optical devices such
as operating microscope and its auxiliary devices are supported with a
retaining link mechanism utilizing a parallel link and are balanced with a
counterweight, and above described operating microscope etc. can be retained
or kept at the desired spatial positions during microsurgery.In the fields of encephalotomy and cardiosurgery, a technique of so-called
microsurgery is employed, in which surgeries are performed under observation
of the focuses using operating microscopes as "medical optical devices".
Various types of stand apparatuses, for retaining heavy operating microscope
and its auxiliary devices at any desired spatial positions, to be utilized in
such microsurgeries have been proposed (e.g. Japanese Patent Publication
before Examination No. 32110/1981). These stands generally are of a balancing
structure, in which a retaining link mechanism employing a parallel link is
pivotally (tiltably) supported at an intermediary portion on a frame, and an
operating microscope is supported at one end portion of the retaining link
mechanism with a counterweight for countervailing the weight of the operating
microscope being supported on the other end portion of the retaining link
mechanism relative to the pivot thereof.As a position where the balancing type stand is set up, an optimum position in
an operating room is selected depending on the content of the surgery to be
carried out, and balance is adjusted at the selected position. In other 
words, while the optimum position around the operating table is specified by a
doctor prior to surgery, the doctor himself is in a sterilized region, so
that moving the stand to the position to set up is carried out by an
assistant such as a nurse who does not participate in the surgery. Since
auxiliary devices such as a side microscope for assistant doctors and a video
camera are attached to the operating microscope, the position of the
counterweight is changed corresponding to the weight of these devices to
adjust the entire balance of the stand so that the operating microscopes with
auxiliary devices and a counterweight are well balanced.However, moving such heavy counterweight is a tremendous task and is also
dangerous for the nurse who is in most cases a woman. Further, the balance
adjusting operation takes too much time to be advantageously rendered for
emergent surgery and the like.What is most serious in the prior art stand is that the balance adjustment
between the operating

<CLAIMS>
A stand for optical devices, comprising:

a retaining link mechanism (4) which comprises first and second parallel links (2,3), each
having four members (7a, 7b, 8a, 8b; 16a, 16b, 17a, 17b) rotationally connected two by

two at four rotational points, said first and second parallel links interlocking each other at
one of said rotational points, said retaining link mechanism being supported at one of the

members of said first parallel link on a rotational fulcrum of a frame (1);
a medical optical device (W1) and/or its auxiliary devices (W2, W3) being retained at the
extremity of a supporting arm (9), said supporting arm being an extension of a member

(8a) of said first parallel link; and
a counterweight (W4) mounted on a rotational point, said rotational point being the
farthest rotational point from said rotational fulcrum, said counterweight being positioned

on a straight line connecting the extremity of said supporting arm and said rotational
fulcrum;

characterised in that the lengths of the members of said second parallel link are variable so
that the counterweight is moveable along said straight line.
A stand for optical devices according to Claim 1, characterised in that said first parallel
link is supported at the intermediary portion of a first vertical arm (7a) thereof on said

rotational fulcrum of said frame, said first parallel link being formed by combining a pair
of first vertical arms (7a,7b) and a pair of first horizontal arms (8a, 8b), said pairs of first

vertical arms and first horizontal arms being parallel, respectively; said supporting arm is
formed by extending an upper one (8a) of said first horizontal arms in one direction; and 

said second parallel link is formed by extending a lower one (8b) of said first horizontal
arms in an opposite direction to provide an upper second horizontal arm (17a), a lower

second horizontal arm (17b) being parallel with said upper second horizontal arm, a
second vertical arm (16a) being formed by extending one of said first vertical arms (7b)

downwardly, and any other second vertical arm (16b) being parallel with said second
vertical arm.
A stand for optical devices according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that a supporting
parallel link (11) having a vertical arm and a horizontal arm is provided below the

supporting arm to support a medical optical device and/or its auxiliary devices on its
horizontal arm.
A stand for optical devices according to any of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that, at a
connecting point of one of said first or second vertical arms and a counterpart member

pivotably supported thereby, a displacement detection means (25, 33, 36) is provided,
said displacement detection means being locked on said counterpart member, said

displacement detection means comprising a detection lever (25) pivotably supported on
said counterpart member via an electromagnetic clutch (C7) in a locked or unlocked

state, a shaft (31) connecting said detection lever and said one of said first or second
vertical arms and being resiliently supported at one end portion thereof by a resilient

bushing (32), a beam irradiation section (33) provided on one of said detection lever or
said one of said first or second vertical arms, and a photo-location section (36) provided

on the other of said detection lever or said one of said first or second vertical arms,
whereby said displacement detection means is adapted to detect the pivoted

displacement of said detection lever (25) with respect to said one of said first or second
vertical arms based on the signal output from said photo-location section (33). 
A stand for optical devices according to Claim 4, characterised in that a drive means (M)
comprising a motor is provided, for retracting each arm of said second parallel link to

allow said counterweight to move along said straight line, together with a control section
for controlling said motor in accordance with the output from said photo-location device

to allow said counterweight to move in a direction such that said detection lever returns to
the neutral position.
A stand for optical devices according to any of Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that, on the
