<ABSTRACT>
A beam splitter for transmitting and deflecting light 
comprises a foil (10) having a top surface (12) and at 

least one hole (30) therethrough. A highly reflective 
finish is provided on the top surface (12) of the foil. 

Light is transmitted through the holes (30) in the foil 
(10) while other light is reflected from the reflective 

finish on the top surface (12).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the splitting of 
light beams. In the optics field, it is common to use a beam 
splitter which is made up of a glass or quartz, for 
splitting or dividing light beams. Usually, the known i.e. 
glass or quartz, beam splitter is mounted at some angle to 
the path of the light beam. A surface of the beam splitter 
is then coated with a fragile coating. It is the optical 
properties of the coating which allow a portion of the 
light to be transmitted through the beam splitter while 
reflecting a uniform portion from the top surface. In these known devices, the beam splitting is 
controlled by controlling the coating on the top surface of 
the beam splitter. Thus, a reflection to transmission 
ratio, such as 50/50 or 70/30, can be achieved by varying 
the coating. However, the known beam splitters do not split light 
wavelengths in the ultraviolet region in the same 
proportion as they split light wavelengths in the infrared 
region. When a known beam splitter is used, for example, 
in a detector for detecting flame in a boiler, this 
disparate splitting of the light wavelengths of the flame 
may cause a problem as the flame detector must detect a 
broad range of light wavelengths. Because of the composition of these known beam 
splitters, i.e. quartz or glass, the production,  
 
manufacture and sale of the beam splitters prove to be very 
costly. In particular, the application of the coatings 
and the finishing of the surface to produce an efficient 
interface are both time consuming. In addition, the 
coatings used for these known beam splitters are also very 
expensive and fragile. Additionally, another problem associated with known 
beam splitters is that some of the light is absorbed by the 
materials, thus reducing the total light transmitted 
through the beam splitter. Aspects of the present invention are set out in claims 
1 and 15. Preferred embodiments of the present invention provide 
devices and methods for splitting light beams which 
comprise a foil having a top surface and having at least 
one hole therethrough. A highly reflective finish is 
provided on the top surface of the foil for deflecting the 
light beam. Such a beam splitter is inexpensive compared 
to the known beam splitters. Preferably, the foil has a thickness less than 
0.0762 mm (.003 inches) and has a plurality of  
 
holes arranged in a pattern through the foil. The top 
surface of the foil has a highly reflective finish provided 
by electropolish. The present invention provides for an 
efficie
