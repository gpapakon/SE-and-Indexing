<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a connector for an electric cable 
with a tensile strain relieving device, for example an extension 

cord socket, a plug or the like. The strain relieving 
device in the connector comprises a clamping member (6) 

which consists of a bottom part (8) and an upper part (9), 
which in open position are interconnected through a foldable 

spacing piece (10) serving as a joint. The parts (8,9) of 
the clamping member are designed such that, when being folded 

over the cable (12), they enter into locking engagement 
with each other. The strain relieving device (6,7) is 

connected to the terminal block (2) of the connector and can 
advantageously be integrated with said terminal block (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a connector for an electric cable 
with a tensile strain relieving device according to the 
precharacterising part of claim 1. The connector comprises a housing which encloses an insulating 
terminal block with a number of contact members, to 
which the conductors of a cable, insertable into the housing 
through an entry opening, can be connected. The connector is 
provided with a special tensile strain relieving device, 
such that any tensile strain in the cable is transferred directly 
to the terminal block and need not be taken up by the 
screwed connection between the cable conductors and the contact 
pins or sleeves, which would be unsuitable both from an 
electrical and a mechanical point of view. A frequently used design of a tensile strain relieving device 
of the above-mentioned kind consists of a plane or 
clamp-shaped cap washer, which by means of two screws presses 
the cable against a seat on one side of the connection 
housing. In this design, the cable has to be fixedly pressed 
in an eccentric position in relation to the longitudinal  
 
axis of the connector. This may entail difficulties, especially 
in the case of coarse and relatively stiff connection 
cables. The eccentric position of the cable may also result 
in leakage in the cable entry opening of the housing. The above-mentioned drawback is avoided in a tensile strain 
relieving device described in SE-A-399 338, which comprises 
two clamping members pivotally attached to the terminal 
block and compressible by means of clamp screws. This design 
has the additional advantage that the two parts of the 
strain relieving device can be easily removed from the terminal 
block when mounting the cable conductors to the contact 
members of the connector. In this way, the connection 
is not prevented by any projecting attachments or the like. 
However, the device is relatively expensive to manufacture 
and mount since it consists of a plurality of parts. Other types of cable clamping devices are disclosed in DE-A-1 
665 200, EP-A-O 353 539 and US-A-5 280 746. The invention aims at developing a connector for an electric 
cable with a tensile strain relieving device of the above-mentioned 
kind which is simpler and less expensive than the 
devices described in the above-mentioned publications. To achieve this aim the invention suggests a connector for 
an electric cable with a tensile strain relieving device according 
to the introductory part of claim 1, which is characterized 
by the features of the characterizing
