<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a water heater having an integral
lime inhibiting system which prevents the accumulation of sediment
on the inside surfaces of the water heater.Sediment accumulation represents a serious problem which has
plagued owners and manufacturers of both gas and electric water
heaters. Heating of water promotes precipitation of sediment. Hot
spots are likely to exist along the flue (in a gas water heater)
and adjacent the combustion chamber of a gas water heater.
Accumulated sediment tends to harden, forming a scale on various
tank surfaces, which reduces water heater efficiency and, in many
cases, leads to failure. Although some accumulated sediment can be
partially removed by routine flushing, this is rarely performed
with any regularity.Accordingly, it is an important object of this invention to
minimize or to prevent the accumulation of sediment in water heater
tanks.Although sediment accumulation preventing devices have been
proposed, each of these devices has exhibited inadequate
performance or encountered other significant disadvantages. The
one disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,762,395 to Taylor requires a
specific orientation before it can assist in the reduction of
sediment accumulation. If installed improperly, such devices will 
not produce the desired effects and may even exaggerate sediment
accumulation.Several water heater manufacturers have attempted to use ringshaped
devices such as the one disclosed in U.S. Patent No.
4,157,077 to Lindahl. These have complicated structures and are
expensive to manufacture and difficult to install. Moreover, their
complex and tortuous manipulation of water flow acts to restrict
the flow of water as it enters the water storage tank.Other prior art devices, such as the one disclosed by Cook in
U.S. Patent No. 4,257,355, utilize a cold water inlet tube having
outward-facing nozzles on the tube and a closed end so as to direct
water flow against the bottom surface of the water storage tank.
These devices rely on the force of the water flow to "blast" the
inside surfaces of water storage tanks.US Patent No. 2,766,200 (Kaufman) relates to a baffle for reducing
turbulence of water in a tank to prevent undue mixing of hot and cold
water in the tank. Turbulence within the tank is minimized and
stratification of the water entering the tank is attained.Finally, modified dip tubes, such as the one disclosed in U.S.
Patent No. 4,898,150, redirect inlet water flow in an attempt to
create a water swirl at the bottom of the water heater. Such
devices,
