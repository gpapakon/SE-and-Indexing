<ABSTRACT>
In a device for evaluating the compression of the cylinders of a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine in motor vehicles having an electric starter and having a measuring device, connected to an evaluation unit, for registering a signal which is proportional to the starter current, a pressure sensor for registering the cylinder pressure of a cylinder is connected to the evaluation unit. From a registered cylinder maximum pressure value and an amplitude maximum value of the signal which is proportional to the starter current and is registered at the same time as the cylinder maximum pressure value, the evaluation unit determines a proportionality factor by means of which the cylinder maximum pressure values of the cylinders which are not provided with a pressure sensor are calculated from the amplitude maximum values assigned to these cylinders.

<CLAIMS>
A device for evaluating the compression in the cylinders of a multi-cylinder
combustion engine in motor vehicles comprising an electric starter, the device

containing a measuring device connected to an evaluating unit (10) for detecting
a signal proportional to the starter current, 
characterised in that
 a pressure sensor
(5) for detecting the pressure (p) of a cylinder (1) is connected to the evaluating

unit (10), and the evaluating unit (10) uses a detectable maximum cylinder
pressure (p
1
) and a maximum amplitude (I
1
) of the signal (I
A
) proportional to the
starter current, which is detectable at the same time as the maximum cylinder

pressure (p
1
), to obtain a proportionality factor (K) whereby the maximum
pressures (p
2
, p
3
, p
4
) of the cylinders (2, 3, 4) not provided with a pressure sensor
can be calculated from the maximum amplitudes (I
2
, I
3
, I
4
) associated with the said
cylinders (2, 3, 4).
A device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 the pressure sensor (5)
can be screwed in place of a spark plug in the cylinder combustion chamber (1).
A device according to claim 1 or 2, 
characterised in that
 the calculation of
the maximum cylinder pressures (p
2
, p
3
, p
4
) can be started when a constant starter
speed has been reached.
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 when the
ignition-lock switch is connected to a switching-on input of a control device, the

starting process can be carried out by a test starting device which does not close
the ignition lock switch.
