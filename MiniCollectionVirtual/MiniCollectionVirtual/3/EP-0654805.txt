<ABSTRACT>
An object of the present invention is to provide a 
solid electrolytic capacitor free of short circuits 

which may be caused by the crawl-up of a solid 
electrolyte comprising a conducting polymer, and having 

high volume efficiency per volume. The solid 
electrolytic capacitor is constructed by successively 

forming an oxide film (203), a solid electrolyte (204) (conducting 
polymer) and a cathode layer on an anode body (202) which has 

an anode lead (201) planted thereon. Then heating is 
applied, by a heater chip, to a part of the solid 

electrolyte (204) crawled up from the head of the anode body (202) 
on the anode lead (201) for insulating thereof and producing 

a solid electrolyte insulated portion (204a) thereby. Or, in 
another way, removing the crawled up solid electrolyte 

by heating with a heater chip and generating further 
thermal decomposition reaction thereon by supplying 

sufficient additional oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a solid 
electrolytic capacitor and a method of manufacturing 
the same, in particular to a solid electrolytic 
capacitor of which the structure of a joint for joining 
an anode lead and an anode lead terminal is improved 
when conducting polymers are used as a solid 
electrolyte, and a method of manufacturing the same for 
realizing the structure of the joint improved as above. As a method of manufacturing a solid electrolytic 
capacitor, there is a method disclosed in Japanese 
Patent Publication Gazette 41244/89 or 44008/89. By 
this method, the solid electrolytic capacitor is 
manufactured as described below. As shown in FIG. 1, in order to prevent a short 
circuit between an anode and a cathode caused by a 
crawled up solid electrolyte 104, concretely, to 
prevent contact between the solid electrolyte 104 and 
an anode lead terminal 106, water-repellent insulation 
112 is first applied or set onto a head of an anode  
 
body 102 which has an anode lead 101 planted thereon. 
Then, an oxide film (not shown), the solid electrolyte 
104 and a cathode layer 105 are formed successively on 
the anode body 102 to form a capacitor element 110. Subsequently, the anode lead 101 and the anode 
lead terminal 106 are joined by welding, and the 
cathode layer 105 and a cathode lead terminal 107 are 
joined by means of a conductive adhesive 108. 
Thereafter, the capacitor element 110 is armored with 
resin 109 by a transfer molding method, except for a 
part of the anode lead terminal 106 and the cathode 
lead terminal 107. Further, a portion of the anode 
lead terminal 106 and the cathode lead terminal 107 
exposed out of the resin 109 are bent along the resin 
109, respectively, to form a chip type solid 
electrolytic capacitor. In Japanese Patent Laid-open Gazette 105523/89 or 
Japanese Patent Publication Gazette 78222/91, it is 
disclosed that a conducting polymer such as 
polypyrrole, polythiophene, or polyaniline is employed 
as the above solid electrolyte 104, and that the solid 
electrolyte (conducting polymer) 104 is produced by the 
chemical polymerization of one of these conducting 
polymers after the insulation 112, which is an 
insulative conducting polymer film or heat-resistant  
 
insulation is formed on the head of the anode body 102, 
after which the solid electrolytic capacitor is 
produced by means of the same steps as above. However, with the conventional capacitor described 
above, particularly with the capacitor in which 
conducting polymers are used as the
