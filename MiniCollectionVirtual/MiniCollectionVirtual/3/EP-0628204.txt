<ABSTRACT>
A segment of a given signal is aligned with a corresponding reference segment by passing the reference segment through a full-wave rectifier (8), an anti-alias filter (10) and a first sampler (9), and storing the result in a first register (19). The output of the first sampler (9) is moreover passed through a second anti-alias filter (12) and a second sampler (13) which samples at a lower rate, and the result is stored in a second register (21). The given signal is then subjected to the same process with the exception that the output signals of the first (9) and second (13) samplers are passed continuously through first (23) and second (25) shift registers respectively until a correlator (40) indicates at least a predetermined degree of correlation between the contents of the second register (21) and the second shift register (25). A sliding correlation is then performed between the contents of the first register (19) and the first shift register (23) to determine the position of the correlation peak. The alignment process may be used when it is required to compare a segment of an audio signal recorded on a magnetic tape with the corresponding segment recorded on a master tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of detecting a segment of a given signal 
which corresponds to a reference segment, the method comprising rectifying the 
reference segment, deriving a first auxiliary reference segment from the rectified 
reference segment by anti-alias filtering and sampling at a first rate, storing said first 
auxiliary reference segment, rectifying the given signal, deriving a first signal from 
the rectified given signal by anti-alias filtering and sampling at said first rate, and 
performing a sliding correlation between said first signal and the stored first auxiliary 
reference segment to determine which segment of said first signal has at least a 
predetermined degree of correlation with said first auxiliary reference segment. A method of this general kind is disclosed in US-A-3919479. This known 
method is used for automatically recognising and identifying programmes and 
commercial advertisements broadcast on television and radio. A method of aligning a segment of a given signal with a corresponding 
reference segment is disclosed, for example, in published European patent application 
EP-A-0309639. This known method is used inter alia in the evaluation of the quality 
of recording on a magnetic tape containing audio and video programme material. 
Characteristics of a selected segment of the audio material recorded are measured both 
upon recording and upon playback, and are compared one with the other, thereby 
indicating the quality of the recording. Obviously for this process to be successful it 
is necessary that the segment of played back material corresponds substantially exactly 
to the scgment whose characteristics were measured upon recording. In order to 
ensure such correspondence in the known method, a picture frame number forming 
part of the video material recorded is used as a marker indicating the start of the audio 
segment to be evaluated upon playback. Such picture frame numbers or an equivalent timecode track may not be 
available in some applications. It is, in theory, possible to record dedicated markers 
within the audio track(s). However, it is difficult to make such markers imperceptible 
to the end user of the tape. It is an object of the present invention to make the 
provision of markers unnecessary.  
 The invention provides a method as defined in the first paragraph hereof which 
is characterized in that the method further comprises deriving a second auxiliary 
reference segment from the rectified reference segment by anti-alias filtering and

A method of detecting a segment of a given signal which corresponds to a 
reference segment, the method comprising rectifying the reference segment, deriving 

a first auxiliary reference segment from the rectified reference segment by anti-alias 
filtering and sampling at a first rate, storing said first auxiliary reference segment, 

rectifying the given signal, deriving a first signal from the rectified given signal by 
anti-alias filtering and sampling at said first rate, and performing a sliding correlation 

between said first signal and the stored first auxiliary reference segment to determine 
which segment of said first signal has at least a predetermined degree of correlation 

with said first auxiliary reference segment, characterized in that the method further 
comprises deriving a second auxiliary reference segment from the rectified reference 

segment by anti-alias filtering and sampling at a second rate, the second rate being 
greater than the first rate, storing said second auxiliary reference segment, deriving a 

second signal from the rectified given signal by anti-alias filtering and sampling at 
said second rate, and performing a sliding correlation between at least a subsegment 

of the stored second auxiliary reference segment and at least a subseqment of that 
segment of said second signal which corresponds to said segment of said first signal 

to determine the position of the peak correlation therebetween and thereby align the 
segment of the given signal with the reference segment. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the first and second signals are 
passed through first and second buffer memories respectively which in consequence 

contain segments of the first and second signals respectively at any given time, the 
passage through the buffer memories being halted upon determination that at least said 

predetermined degree of correlation exists between the current contents of the first 
buffer memory and said first auxiliary reference segment. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2 wherein, upon halting of the passage through 
the buffer memories, the correlation function of the current contents of the first buffer 

memory with the first auxiliary reference segment is calculated to indicate the position 
of the peak correlation therebetween to within a fraction of a sample period at said 

first rate, the sliding correlation performed between at least a subsegment of the stored 
second auxiliary reference segment and at least a subsegment of that segment of said  

 
second signal which corresponds to said segment of said first signal being carried out 

for a range of relative positions which includes the indicated position of the peak 
correlation. 
A method as claimed in Claim 3 wherein said range is centered on said 
indicated position. 
A method as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the sliding correlation performed 
between at least a subsegment of the stored second auxiliary reference segment and 

at least a subsegment of that segment of said second signal which corresponds to said 
segment of said first signal is performed independently between a plurality of 

subsegments of the stored second auxiliary reference segment and corresponding 
subsegments of said segment of said second signal. 
A method as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the given signal and the reference 
segment are bandpass filtered audio signals.
