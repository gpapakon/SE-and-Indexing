<ABSTRACT>
Image data coded highly efficiently in accordance with the MPEG standards are subjected to an interleave 
processing and recorded in units of an IGOP on clusters of a minidisk. The clusters each comprise a predetermined 

number of sectors and are connected to each other through link sectors. If a minidisk is a ROM minidisk, and a P 
picture or B picture exists in the head of a cluster, an image used as a prediction criterion is coded and recorded as 

an I picture in the link sector immediately before the cluster besides the P or B picture. In decoding, unless any I 
picture is recorded in the link sector of the preceding cluster of the cluster, the substantial decoding of the P picture 

or B picture in the head of the cluster is prohibited. In this way, it is possible to easily edit the highly efficiently 
decoded image data in units of a GOP quickly when the data are recorded on a disklike recording medium such as 

a minidisk. Further a special playback such as fast forward or reverse playback in units of a GOP can be executed 
easily and quickly.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to disc-shaped recording media and to the recording of
data and the reproduction of data from such media.As is well known, a CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read Only Memory) is
standardized based on music CD (Compact Disc Digital Audio: hereinafter simply
abbreviated as CD-DA).Initially, a physical format thereof will be described briefly. The physical
format means a format with which data can be read out at least physically from the
CD-ROM disc when such disc is loaded onto a CD-ROM drive.One disc can include music tracks or data tracks of 99 tracks at maximum.
Information concerning such track is recorded on the disc at its starting portion called
a TOC (Table of Contents), i.e., at the innermost peripheral portion of the disc. A
portion in which the TOC is recorded is referred to as a leading track (leading
Track). On the other hand, on the ending track, i.e., CD-DA, a portion in which a
piece of last music is ended is referred to as a leadout track (Leadout 
Track).In the CD-DA, a stereo audio signal is converted into
digital audio signal at a sampling rate of 16 bits and 44.1 kHz
and recorded, data of 2 (stereo) x 2 (16 bits) x 44.100 =
176,400 bytes is recorded per second. In the CD-ROM, a sector
which results from dividing one second equally by 75 is handled
as a minimum unit and therefore one sector is formed of 2,352
bytes.In the case of CD-ROM MODE-1, one sector includes SYNC
data (12 bytes), header (4 bytes), ECC (Error Correction Coding:
276 bytes) for error-correction, EDC (Error Detect Coding: 4
bytes) or the like and therefore remaining 2048 bytes are
recorded as user data. ECC and EDC are omitted from data, such
as audio and image data, which need not be strictly error-corrected
by data interpolation processing or the like, and
2,336 bytes except SYNC and header are recorded in one sector as
user data. This is referred to as CD-ROM MODE-2.Recently, personal audio equipments called mini disc
(trademark) that can he recorded and reproduced have been
developed and are now commercially available on the market.The mini disc employs an EFM (Eight to Fourteen
Modulation) as a disc writing modulation system and CIRC (Cross
Interleave Reed-Solomon Code) as an error correction code.
Audio data compressed according to an ATRAC (Adaptive Transform
Acoustic Coding) system is recorded in accordance with this
format. Compressed data is recorded at every block called a
cluster as shown in FIG. 6. This is a format very close to the 
above-mentioned CD-ROM MODE 2.The CD-ROM uses 98 frames of

<CLAIMS>
A disc-shaped recording medium (1a) which comprises sectors and on which
coded digital data is recorded in clusters each comprising a predetermined number of

said sectors, said data being interleaved at an interleave length, and link sectors (L),
which are longer than said interleave length, being provided at the connection points

of said clusters, characterised in that said coded digital data is high-efficiency-coded
digital image data comprising groups of pictures (GOPs) made up from intra-coded

pictures and predictive-coded pictures, and in that each group of pictures (GOP) is
recorded in a respective integral number of said clusters.
A disc-shaped recording medium according to claim 1, which is a medium that
can only be reproduced and wherein, when a forward predictive-coded picture or a

bidirectionally predictive-coded picture exists at the start of a cluster, a picture which
becomes a predictive standard of said forward predictive-coded picture or said

bidirectionally predictive-coded picture is coded as an intra-coded picture and
recorded on said link sector of the immediately preceding cluster.
Apparatus for recording data on a disc-shaped recording medium (1a) which
comprises sectors, the apparatus comprising encoding/recording means (27, 21, 20)

for encoding digital data and recording the encoded data on the recording medium
(1a) in clusters each comprising a predetermined number of said sectors, said data

being interleaved at an interleave length, and link sectors (L), which are longer than
said interleave length, being provided at the connection points of said clusters,

characterised in that said encoding/recording means (27, 21, 20) is operative to
encode digital image data to produce high-efficiency-coded digital image data

comprising groups of pictures (GOPs) made up from intra-coded pictures and
predictive-coded pictures, and to record each group of pictures (GOP) in a respective

integral number of said clusters.
Apparatus for reproducing data from a disc-shaped recording medium (1a)
which comprises sectors, the apparatus comprising reproducing/decoding means (20, 

21, 29) operative (i) to reproduce, from the recording medium (1a), high-efficiency-coded
digital image data comprising groups of pictures (GOPs) made up from intra-coded

pictures and predictive-coded pictures, each group of pictures (GOP) being
recorded in a respective integral number of clusters each comprising a predetermined

number of said sectors, said data being interleaved at an interleave length, and link
sectors (L), which are longer than said interleave length, being provided at the

connection points of said clusters; and (ii) to decode the reproduced digital image data
to produce original image data.
Apparatus according to clam 4, wherein, when a forward predictive-coded
picture or a bidirectionally predictive-coded picture is recorded at the start of a

cluster, if it is determined on the basis of said digital image data reproduced by the
reproducing means that a picture which becomes a 
predictive standard of said forward
predictive-coded picture or said bidirectionally predictive-coded picture is not coded

as an intra-coded picture and is not recorded on said link sector of the immediately
preceding cluster, the decoding means is inhibited from substantially decoding said

forward predictive-coded picture or said bidirectionally predictive-coded picture
recorded at the start of the cluster.
