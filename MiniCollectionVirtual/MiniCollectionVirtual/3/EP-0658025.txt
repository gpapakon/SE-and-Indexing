<ABSTRACT>
A system of high availablity synchronous bandwidth allocation comprising an 
FDDI segment to which are connected a first device having means for allocating 

synchronous bandwidth over said FDDI segment to any requesting device, 
and at least a second device having means for requesting synchronous 

bandwidth over said FDDI segment, and further comprising means in said 
first device, and in a third device also connected to said FDDI segment, for 

establishing a communication and exchanging between said first and third devices 
information regarding the allocation of synchronous bandwidth to said 

at least second device, and means in said third device to take over the first 
device as synchronous bandwidth allocator, when said first device is in failure.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the data communication field and more particularly 
to a system of high availability of synchronous bandwidth allocation 
over FDDI. The availability of Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) networks is of 
great interest in the telecommunication field. The telecommunication users are 
particularly sensitive to the response time and the guaranteed bandwidth involved 
in their communication through the network specially when the communications 
are exchange between Multimedia applications - ie the possibility 
for an Client/Server application to transmit and receive multimedia data 
through a telecommunication network at any instant and without delay (= 
synchronous data trafic)-.
 
   Such requirements imply that the telecommunication network be able to 
manage the available bandwidth and response time which are likely to change 
in the telecommunication network and which are likely to damage the telecommunication. Fiber Distributed Data Interface describes a dual counter-rotating fiber-optic 
ring operating at 100 Mega Bits per seconds. Fiber Distributed Data Interface 
uses a token-passing protocol, with each station having the chance to transmit 
frames when a token passes.
 
   Fiber Distributed Data Interface uses two rings, one called the primary ring 
and the other the secondary ring. The primary ring may be likened to the 
main-ring path, with the secondary ring acting as the backup ring path.
 
   Stations, if attaching directly can attach to either or both of these rings. In 
order to differentiate between stations that attach to one or both rings, two 
classes of station are defined.  A Class A station attaches to both of the rings directly, while Class B stations 
attach to one of the rings.
 
   One of the prime requirements for Fiber Distributed Data Interface is a 
high-speed establishment backbone to interconnect heterogeneous Local Area 
Network. To this end, the Fiber Distributed Data Interface Local Area Network 
design must have reliability and capacity built in. Attachment cost does 
not have to be so carefully limited, since most of the cheaper stations, would 
be connected to the lower speed Local Area Networks that were themselves 
bridged to the Fiber Distributed Data Interface backbone. Fiber Distributed 
Data Interface has satisfied these requirements by: 
Operating at a data rate of 100 Mega Bits per second, providing lot of capacity. Having a dual optical fiber ring configuration, that can be reconfigured by 
the class A stations in the
