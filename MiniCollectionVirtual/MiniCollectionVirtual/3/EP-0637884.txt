<ABSTRACT>
Test system for testing a telecommunication system (1) for reliability 
of the usage registration. A number of simulation units (8) is 

connected via normal subscriber lines (7). Each comprises a control 
unit (9) which is controlled by a control program (13) with a number 

of program steps (1...n). Each of these comprises a start code 
(S1...Sn). A program step is executed after the control unit detects a 

start code signal (SCS) which is identical to the start code valid for 
that program step. Simultaneously, the corresponding program steps in 

the other simulation units are executed, by means of which the 
simultaneous behaviour of different subscribers is simulated. In all 

the simulation units, the start code signals and the various start 
codes are identical to one another. Preferably, the program start 

codes and the start code signal comprise a time code. The start code 
signal can be an externally generated radio signal, such as the DCF77 

radio time signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a system for testing a telecommunication
system, according to the preamble of claim 1.A similar test system is known from prior art, e.g. from DE-A-3212006.
The disclosed test system comprises a single simulation unit
connected to an telecommunication exchange under test via a number of
subscriber lines for the simulation of subscriber traffic in order to
generate various load circumstances for the telecommunication exchange
under test. The known test system has the limitation that in fact only a
single telecommunication exchange is tested, and moreover under subscriber
traffic which originates only at the exchange itself.The present invention provides a test system which does not have
the above mentioned limitation. The test system has according to the
invention the characteristic of claim 1. The simulation units simulate
subscribers, either A subscribers or B subscribers. The system is intended
to test the telecommunication system, for example, the reliability thereof
with respect to the registration of the usage costs. In particular, the
system has been developed by the applicant in order to test whether a new
service such as "itemized billing" functions correctly in all
circumstances. Thus it may be important to know how such provisions
function in practice, if, for example, an A subscriber calls a B subscriber
who, in the same instant, has himself started a call. It is also possible,
apart from such status changes (in this case of the B subscriber) for
settings of A or B subscribers to play a part in the functioning of the
cost registration function, for example a setting to "call forwarded to
another subscriber number". Each of the simulation units is therefore
provided with a control means (the control unit together with the control
program) by means of which successively different statuses and/or settings
can be simulated. Thus it is possible to simulate successively the statuses
"B subscriber engaged", "B subscriber free but does not pick up", "B
subscriber free but picks up at the same instant that a call reaches him",
"A 
subscriber wants to dial but is called at the same instant" etc. The
same simulation unit can alternately simulate an A or a B subscriber
set. It is also possible to simulate different settings of the
subscriber set, such as "call forwarded to another subscriber number",
and so on. The entire test consists of a number of test scenarios
which each consist of a number of subscenarios matched to one another,
which are distributed over the various
