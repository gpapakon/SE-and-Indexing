<ABSTRACT>
The fixing system employs a special fixing device and a correspondingly designed pipe support clamp (pipe holder). The pipe support clamps are fixed by means of the fixing device to the wires of welded wire meshes or the like. The pipe support clamps have an opening (20) for receiving a heating pipe and a tunnel (18), connected resiliently to said opening, at 22, for mounting onto the wire (15). Provided laterally on the opening (20) of the pipe support clamp (12) are oblique faces (19) which are directed upwards in the mounting direction and are associated with correspondingly directed and arranged oblique faces (17) on an ejecting shaft (7) of the fixing device. The fixing device is equipped with an ejecting pusher (5) which is arranged at the entrance to the ejecting shaft (7) and passes upwards to an operating lever located in the handle and which, by way of its end remote from the operating lever, extends into the region of the opening (20) for the heating pipe in order, on actuation of the operating lever, to push the pipe support clamps out of the ejecting shaft onto the wire (15), the oblique faces (19) of the pipe support clamp (12) sliding on the oblique faces (17) on the ejecting shaft (7) in such a way that the tunnel (18) is spread and is resiliently mounted onto the wire. As a result, a fixing is possible which can be carried out by the user in an upright posture without great physical effort. At the same time, a secure mounting of the pipe support clamp is made possible.

Fixing system for pipe holders for underfloor heating pipes with a fixing 
device for the pipe holders, which has an opening (20) for receiving a heating 

pipe and a tunnel (18) connected thereto for placing on the wire (15) of a 
support mat or the like, the fixing device having an ejection member (5) located 

at the inlet of an ejection shaft (7) and which is guided upwards to an 
operating lever (3) located in a handle (1) and runs with its end remote from 

the operating lever in the vicinity of the opening (20) for the heating pipe, 
so as to press the pipe holders (12) on operating the operating lever out of 

the ejection shaft (7) onto the wire (15) of the support mat, characterized in 
that laterally with respect to the opening (20) for the heating pipe the pipe 

holder (12) has in the fitting direction upwardly directed sloping surfaces 
(19), with which are associated correspondingly directed and arranged sloping 

surfaces (17) on the ejection shaft (7), which so slide on the sloping surfaces 
(19) of the pipe holder that the tunnel (18) is expanded and resiliently mounted 

on the wire (15). 
Fixing system according to claim 1, characterized in that a return spring 
(6) is provided for the ejection member (5). 
Fixing system according to claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the ejection 
member (5) is guided in a guidance pipe (4), which links the ejection shaft (7) 

with the top handle (1). 
Fixing system according to one or more of the claims 1, 2 or 3, characterized 
in that a magazine (10) for receiving a plurality of pipe holders (12) is 

provided in parallel to the ejection member (5) between the handle (1) and the 
ejection shaft (7). 
Fixing system according to claim 4, characterized in that a locking device 
(11) for the mounted pipe holders (12) is provided at the delivery end of the 

magazine (10). 
Fixing system according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that wedge-shaped guidance aids (8) for the wire (15) are provided on 

the surface of the ejection shaft (7) facing the support mat wire (15) in the 
use position.  

 
Fixing system according to one or more of the preceding claims, characterized 
in that to the front of the ejection shaft (7) is fitted a positioning rod 

(9) indicating the position of the tunnel (18) of the pipe holder (12) to be 
ejected.
