<ABSTRACT>
A heat transfer sheet comprising a lubricating layer provided on one 
surface of a substrate film and a dye layer formed on the other 

surface of the substrate, wherein the dynamic frictional coefficient 
between said lubricating layer and the thermal head is within the 

range of from 0.07 to 0.16.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a heat transfer sheet by 
use of a sublimable dye (heat migratable dye), more 
particularly, to a heat transfer sheet which has solved 
the both problems of printing wrinkle and image 
dislocation due to slippage generated during heat 
transfer printing. Various heat transfer methods have been known in the 
art, and among them, there has been proposed a method in 
which a sublimable dye is used as the recording material. 
The dye is carried on a substrate sheet such as a 
polyester film to form a heat transfer sheet. By using 
the transfer sheet, various full colors are formed on an 
image-receiving sheet having a dye receptive layer with a 
sublimable dye such as paper or plastic film. In this 
case, a thermal head of a printer is used as the heating 
means, and a large number of color dots of 3 or 4 colors 
are transferred onto the image-receiving sheet by heating 
for a very short time, thereby reproducing the full-color 
image of the original with the color dots of said multi-color. The thus formed image is very sharp, since the 
colorant used is a dye and also excellent in 
transparency, whereby the obtained image is excellent in 
reproducibility and gradation of the intermediate color, 
similar to the image according to the offset printing and 
gravure printing of the prior art, and further can form 
an image of high quality comparable with full-color 
photographic image. As the substrate film of the above heat transfer 
sheet, papers such as condenser paper may be sometimes 
employed, but such thin paper is lower in strength, 
particularly weak in bursting strength and therefore, it 
is desirable to use a film having a tough plastic such as 
polyester resin as the substrate film.  
 However, in this case, the following problems will 
further ensue. That is, the transfer sheet is thermally 
deformed due to the heat of a temperature of 250 to 300°C 
or higher being locally loaded from the thermal head to 
the heat transfer sheet during printing. Further, the 
heat transfer sheet is conveyed under pressurization of 
thermal head to be nonuniformly elongated, whereby a 
large number of wrinkles are generated on the sheet. As 
the result, not only running under the thermal head is 
obstructed, but also slippage and drop-out of the dots 
are generated in the obtained image, thus involving the 
problem that the resolution of the printed image is 
lowered, and also that color reproducibility is lowered 
in formation of full-color. Such problems become 
particularly conspicuous
