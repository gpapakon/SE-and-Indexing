<DESCRIPTION>
The invention pertains to an electrical connector
for connecting electrical cables to an edge of a
flexible flat cable, and particularly, to a connector
for connecting a row of coaxial electrical cables to an
edge of one flat cable.A flexible flat cable comprises an electrical cable
constructed of slender, electrical conductor traces on
broad surfaces of a thin and flexible sheet of
dielectric material. The conductor traces are
manufactured by a process of metal plating to apply
plated metal to the flexible sheet, followed by chemical
etching of the plated metal to produce the final shapes
of the slender conductor traces. Alternatively, the
circuit traces can be fabricated by a selective metal
plating process that applies plated metal only where the
slender circuit traces are desired. The selective metal
plating process will eliminate the need to chemical etch
the plated metal. This type of cable provides numerous
conductor traces in a small space, and is useful to
provide numerous parallel conductor traces connected to
high density electronic circuits in an electronic
device. The flat cable emanates from the electronic
device, and is useful to connect the electronic device
to larger electrical cables of electrical equipment.Multiple flat cables are used for connection to
numerous electronic circuits, for example, the
electronic circuits in a medical diagnostic transducer.
The multiple flat cables are attached at their one ends
to the transducer. The flat cables emanate from the
transducer in a compact stack, one on another. The
edges of the flat cables can be spread out from one
another in the stack for connection of them to larger
coaxial type, electrical cables that are associated with
medical diagnostic equipment. An electrical connector
is desired for the coaxial cables that will disconnect
from respective flat cables to permit replacement of a 
defective transducer and interchange among transducers of
different types. Such an electrical connector would be narrow
to match the thin and flat configurations of the flat cables,
to fit compactly within the stack of multiple flat cables, and
to permit close together stacking of multiple connectors within
the stack of flat cables. Such a connector is capable of
disconnecting from a flat cable and this allows the flat cable
to be replaced or interchanged with other flat cables.A flexible, double sided, flat cable may have circuit
traces on both sides. An electrical connector is therefore
desired which will connect and disconnect coaxial cables to the
circui
