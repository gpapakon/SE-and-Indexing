<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and an equipment for monitoring the fill rate of an elastic buffer memory used in a synchronous digital telecommunication system, such as the SDH or SONET system. To enable the monitoring of the fill rate of the channels with less hardware than previously, the fill rate of at least two channels of the same level of hierarchy is monitored on a time-division basis in a monitoring unit (64) common to said channels.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to
the preamble portion of the accompanying claim 1, and
to an equipment according to the preamble portion of
the accompanying claim 3 for monitoring the fill rate
of an elastic buffer memory.The current digital transmission network is
plesiochronous, that is, e.g. each 2-Mbit/s basic
multiplex system has a dedicated clock independent of
any other system. It is therefore impossible to locate
a single 2-Mbit/s signal in the bit stream of a
higher-order system, but the higher-level signal has
to be demultiplexed through each intermediate level
down to the 2 Mbit/s level to extract the 2-Mbit/s
signal. For this reason, especially the construction
of branch connections requiring several multiplexers
and demultiplexers has been expensive. Another disadvantage
of the plesiochronous transmission network
is that equipments from two different manufacturers
are not usually compatible.The above drawbacks, among other things, have
led to the introduction of the new synchronous digital
hierarchy SDH specified e.g. in the CCITT specifications
G.707, G.708 and G.709. The synchronous digital
hierarchy is based on STM-N transfer frames (Synchronous
Transport Modules) located on several levels of
hierarchy N (N=1,4,16...). Existing PCM systems, such
as 2-, 8- and 32-Mbit/s systems are multiplexed into a
synchronous 155.520-Mbit/s frame of the lowest level
of the SDH (N=1). Consistently with the above, this
frame is called the STM-1 frame. On the higher levels
of hierarchy the bit rates are multiples of the bit 
rate of the lowest level.Figure 1 illustrates the structure of the STM-N
frame, and Figure 2 illustrates a single STM-1 frame.
The STM-N frame comprises a matrix with 9 rows and
N x 270 columns so that there is one byte at the
junction point between each row and the column. Rows
1-3 and rows 5-9 of the N x 9 first columns comprise a
section overhead SOH, and the row 4 comprises an AU
pointer. The rest of the frame structure is formed of
a section having the length of N x 261 columns and
containing the payload section of the STM-N frame.Figure 2 illustrates a single STM-1 frame which
is 270 bytes in length, as described above. The
payload section comprises one or more administration
units AU. In the specific case shown in the figure,
the payload section consists of the administration
unit AU-4, into which a virtual container VC-4 is
inserted. (Alternatively, the STM-1 transfer frame may
contain several lower-level administration units (AU-3)
each containing a
