<ABSTRACT>
A connecting mechanism has a reversely tapered fit 
portion (43), an elastically expandable collet chuck 

(44) fitted on the fit portion (43), a locking sleeve 
(45) surrounding the outer peripheral surface of the fit 

portion (43) and axially slidably mounted on the outer 
peripheral surface of the collet chuck (44), and a 

spring (46) for biasing the locking sleeve (45) in its 
advancing direction. The locking sleeve (45) advances 

with collet chuck (44) being fitted on the fit portion 
(43) and locks the collet chuck (44) such that the 

collet chuck (44) cannot be expanded in the fit portion 
(43). This makes small the elastically expanding force 

of the collet chuck which fits the fit portion (43) to 
the collet chuck (44) and the biasing force of the 

spring (46) which locks the collet chuck (44).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a connecting mechanism for
connecting two members together, and more particularly to
a connecting mechanism for detachably connecting together
the respective ends of two rod members of a space craft
structure, a space station structure, and the structures of
any other mechanisms, apparatuses, tools or the like. It
is even more particularly related to a connecting mechanism
for connecting two members each having a first end,
comprising a fit portion having a forward end and a rear
end connected to said first end of either one of said two
members and comprising a first part with increasing
diameter towards the forward end and a second part at the
forward end with decreasing diameter, an axially slidable
cylindrical locking sleeve connected to that first end of
the other member, partially surrounding said fit portion
and a spring disposed between said one of the two members
and said cylindrical locking sleeve for biasing said
locking sleeve towards the forward end of the fit portion.
A connecting mechanism of that kind is known from GB-2 248
664.There have been developed various kinds of foldable
and extendible truss structures of space crafts, space
stations and the like. They have hinge mechanisms
connecting together the respective ends of a plurality of
rod members of the truss structure which is folded or
extended at the hinge mechanisms so as to take their
predetermined folded or extended shapes.Such a truss structure occupies a small volume when it
is folded. It is launched by a rocket or the like into the
space in a folded state and is extended into a required
developed shape in the space. Although the truss structure has a complicated
structure in an extended state in general, it is designed
so as to occupy a minimum volume in a folded state. In
this regard, rod members around the hinge mechanisms draw
complicated loci when the truss structure is folded and
extended. Since five or six rod members are connected to
a hinge mechanism in general, the hinge mechanism has a
very complicated structure. 
This results in a heavy weight, a poor reliability and a
high manufacturing cost of the hinge mechanism. Many kinds
of truss structures must be manufactured in order to obtain
many different extended states. Thus, many different kinds
of complicated hinge mechanisms must be made according to
the different truss structures, leading to a high
manufacturing cost.GB-2 248 664 describes a device for clamping a tubular
member to a connector in which the tubular member is held
between a

<CLAIMS>
A connecting mechanism for connecting two members (11,
41) each having a first end, comprising:


a fit portion (43) having a forward end and a rear end
connected to said first end of either one of said two

members (11, 41) and comprising a first part with
increasing diameter towards the forward end and a second

part at the forward end with decreasing diameter;
an axially slidable cylindrical locking sleeve (45)
connected to said first end of the member (41 or

11), partially surrounding said fit portion (43);
a spring (46) disposed between said one of the two
members (11 or 41) and said cylindrical locking sleeve

(45) for biasing said locking sleeve (45) towards the
forward end of the fit portion (43),

characterized by

an elastically extendable collet chuck (44) having a
cylindrical wall comprising a first part with increasing

diameter towards the free end and a second part at the
free end with decreasing diameter on the inside as well

as on the outside and axial grooves (48) formed in said
cylindrical wall, and 
the locking sleeve (45) having an inner peripheral
surface having a shape fitted onto said outer peripheral

surface of said collet chuck (44) so as to be fitted
thereto.
The connecting mechanism according to claim 1,

characterized in that said collet chuck (44) has an outer
peripheral surface, and the member (41) housing the

collet chuck (44) has a fit hole (47) having an inner
peripheral surface, for receiving said collet chuck (44)

with said outer peripheral surface thereof being in
closely contact with said inner perpheral surface of said

fit hole (47).
