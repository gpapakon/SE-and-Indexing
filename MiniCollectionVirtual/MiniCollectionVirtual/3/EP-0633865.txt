<ABSTRACT>
The device is finding application in the mechanical engineering, the food industry, the energetics, the building, the transport, the medicine and the household for activation of water, water systems, fuels and oils. It ensures a high efficiency of the magnetic treatment, low hydraulic resistance, reduced overall dimensions and high output. The device consists of an external casing (1) of nonmagnetic material into which is disposed a hollow cylindrical body (2) of nonmagnetic material over which is winded up the electromagnetizing coil (3). In the cavity of the body (2) is put the core (4) of nonmagnetic material formed by the elements (from 4.1 to 4.6) arranged along the axle of the core (4), consecutively rotated at an equal angle in the same direction, forming two stepped screw-shaped channels with the inside surface of the hollow cylindrical body (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for magnetic 
treatment of liquids such as water, water systems 
oils and fuels, which are used in the mechanical engineering, 
the food industry, the energetics, the building, 
the transport, the medicine and the household. A device for magnetic treatment of water is known 
comprising a cylindrical two-shoulder body of nonmagnetic 
material. The shoulder with a smaller diameter is hollow 
and longer. Into its cavity is pressed in the magnetizing 
coil. The second shoulder with a greater diameter 
possesses a circular channel (cannelure) from the side of 
the first shoulder with the smaller diameter. Over the 
first shoulder with the smaller diameter is laid an insert 
of nonmagnetic material whose outside diameter is 
equal to the outside diameter of the second shoulder with 
the greater diameter and whose lenght is smaller than 
the lenght of the shoulder with the smaller diameter. The 
insert with a longitudinal groove is clamped to the two-shoulder 
body by means of cup-shaped cap. In the shoulder 
with the greater diameter and in the cup-shaped cap are 
bored apertures for the inlet and the outlet of the liquid. The disadvantages of the known device are the relatively 
low effect of the magnetic treatment and the increased 
hydraulic resistance. Another device for the magnetic treatment of lubricating 
and cooling liquids is known consisting of 
a casing of nonmagnetic material, inside of which is disposed 
a hollow cylindrical body of nonmagnetic material, 
over which body is winded up the electromagnetizing coil. 
Into the cavity of the body is put a cylindrical core 
of nonmagnetic material possessing a screw-shaped groove. 
The cylindrical body is closed by caps with apertures for 
the inlet and the outlet of the liquid. Such a device is described in US-A-4 956 083. The disadvantages of this device are the relatively 
low effect of magnetic treatment and the increased 
hydraulic resistance.  
 The task of the present invention is the devising 
of a device for magnetic treatment of liquids enabling a 
higher effect of the treatment and with lower hydraulic 
resistance. This task is achieved with the device for magnetic 
treatment of liquids according to the invention, consisting 
of a casing of nonmagnetic material, inside of which 
casing is disposed a hollow cylindrical body of nonmagnetic 
material, over which body is winded up the electromagnetizing 
coil and are set up the caps with apertures. 
Into the cavity of the body is put the core of
