<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a wide range of colors in images that are presented in successive frames on image fields (13) on color opto-electronic display means having separate illumination elements each of a different color at each pixel location. Each pixel location, for example, may have a red, a green and a blue illumination element. The display is divided into uniformly-sized display neighborhoods (17). The process includes, for a given pixel location (a-p) within any one of the uniformly-sized display neighborhoods, producing a given color at that pixel location by selecting a frame sequence for illuminating the illumination elements at the pixel location during presentation of an image wherein the number of times that any given illumination element at the pixel location is illuminated within a given frame sequence is controlled to create an appearance of color shading of that pixel location relative to other pixel locations and wherein adjacent pixel locations that have the same color within any one of the display neighborhoods have their illumination elements illuminated with different frame sequences to minimize display noise.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to
processes for providing multi-color images on opto-electronic
display devices; more particularly, the
present invention relates to processes for producing
multi-color shaded images in successive frames of video
information on opto-electronic display devices such as
flat-panel LCDs (liquid crystal diodes) and similar
display devices.In recent years, the computer industry has
given significant attention to laptop computer
components and, more particularly, to providing laptop
computer components with the same functionality as
desktop computers. One particular challenge has been
the opto-electronic displays, such as flat-panel LCDs
(liquid crystal diodes) and similar display devices
that are employed with laptop computers.LCDs and other flat-panel display devices
differ from CRT devices in two important aspects.
First, in operation of a CRT device, an electron beam
is driven to scan rapidly back and forth across a
screen to sequentially energize selected picture-element
or "pixel" locations along horizontal scanning
lines; the net effect of a complete raster of scans is
to reproduce snapshot-like "frames" that each contain
video data as to the state of each pixel location on 
each scanning line. The horizontal scanning lines are
organized by synchronizing signals, with each frame
containing a fixed number of horizontal lines. The
frames are reproduced at a standard rate; for example,
the frame repetition rate might be sixty frames per
second.In operation of LCDs and similar flat-panel
display devices, there is no back and forth scanning of
an electron beam -- in fact, there is no electron beam.
Instead, such display devices employ arrays of shift
registers, with the result that locations anywhere on a
screen can be illuminated simultaneously -- i.e., at
exactly the same instant. Nevertheless, in flat-panel
display devices as in CRT devices that are employed
with microprocessor-based computers, video information
is still presented in frames. Each frame normally
comprises a field which is 640 pixel locations wide by
480 pixel locations high, and the typical frame repetition
rate is sixty frames per second (i.e., 60 hertz).Also, LCDs and similar flat-panel display
screens differ from CRT devices in that the
illumination intensity (i.e., brightness) at the pixel
locations cannot be varied. Instead, the illumination
intensity at pixel locations on a flat-panel display
screen is either "on" or "off". (For present purposes,
a pixel location will be considered "on" when
