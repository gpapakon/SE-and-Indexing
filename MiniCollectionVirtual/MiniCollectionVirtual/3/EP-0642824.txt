<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method 
for adjusting the pH of water to a value adjustable 

in the range from 1 to 13 and an apparatus 
for carrying out said method. The method 

comprises the arrangement for adjusting the pH 
of water in at least one step of a cascade system, 

in which said step comprises an electrodialysis 
cell, with one or two membranes or one or 

more pairs of selective membranes which can be 
controllably displaced between the electrodes 

(cathode and anode) perpendicularly to the water 
flow traversing the cell so as to obtain a variation 

of the adjustment of the pH of the water 
processed in the cell. Unseparable processes 

coupled with adjusting the pH of water in catholyte 
(electrolyte from the cathodic cell) and 

anolyte telectrolyte from the anodic cell) are 
changes in the chemical composition of water 

solutions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a 
method for adjusting the pH of water to a value 
which can be adjusted in the range of 1 to 13 and 
an apparatus for carrying out said method, as well 
as further relating to an application of the thus 
adjusted water so as to improve the properties of 
soils. As disclosed in articles and data 
published in scientific and technical papers and in 
newspapers, books and patents, a lot of instruments 
and methods are used for adjusting the pH of water 
and aqueous solutions, in precipitating and 
dissolving processes, in aqueous solutions, 
electrocoagulation, in the preparation of 
disinfectant water or ionized water, in the removal 
of metal ions or nitrates of volatile components 
from aqueous solutions, and so on, and these 
methods are based on electrolysis, electrodialysis, 
electroosmosis or other chemical or electrochemical 
processes. In all the patented electrodialysis 
arrangements, the cells comprise cathode parts and 
anode parts which are separated by membranes. The USA patent No. 4936962, having for  
 
title: "Process for adjusting the pH of an aqueous 
flowable fluid" relates to the adjustment of the pH 
of water by a circulation of an electrolyte, the 
two electrodes being separated by pairs of 
membranes: a membrane being of a bipolar type and 
the other being selective to the ions. The EPO Patent No. EP-0247852 having for 
title: "Process and apparatus for producing aqueous 
ion-containing solution" relates to the adjustment 
of the water pH in an electrolytic cell, the 
electrodes of which are separated by a membrane and 
in which silver ions are introduced into the 
electrolyte by a partial dissolution of the silver 
electrode. Aqueous acid and base media are 
disclosed in the USA Patent No. 4880513 having for 
title "Method and apparatus for generating acid and 
base regenerants and the use thereof to regenerate 
ion-exchange resins", with respect to the 
recirculation of the electrolyte in an electrolyte 
supplied by a bipolar membrane. An apparatus for preparing acid and 
basic water, which does not use any membrane, has 
been disclosed in the EPO patent No. EP 0531783  
 
having for title "Water draining system for an 
apparatus producing ion containing water by 
continuous electrolysis". The EPO patent No. EP-039107 having for 
title: "Ion concentration setting apparatus for 
ionic water" discloses a possibility of obtaining a 
required ionic concentration in acid or basic water 
by controlling the potential or voltage applied to 
set
