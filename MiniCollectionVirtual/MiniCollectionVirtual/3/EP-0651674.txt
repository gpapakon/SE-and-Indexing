<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to catalyst systems and their use for the oxidation
of organic compounds and in particular to the selective oxidation of organic
compounds particularly aliphatic compounds and alkyl aromatic compounds. A
particularly useful feature is their performance as ring opening catalysts. In a
preferred embodiment the invention is concerned with the oxidation of saturated
hydrocarbon chains.Saturated organic compounds are difficult to oxidise and despite attempts to
develop methods and techniques for their controlled or selective oxidation
techniques using mild conditions with relatively high yields are only known for the
conversion of butane via butenes into maleic anhydride, furthermore the known
processes use homogenous and sometimes hazardous catalysts requiring
complex separation techniques. An example of such processes are given in
Catalysis Today Vol. I Nos. 5 of October 1987 relative to the selective catalytic
oxidation of butane to maleic anhydride involving dehydrogenation and oxidation
of the resulting intermediate olefin, the article in Tetrahedron Vol. 31 pages 777-784
concerning the oxidation of cyclohexane with molecular oxygen and the
article in the Journal of the CHEM. SOC. CHEM. COMMUN. 1987 page 1487 and
Journal of Molecular Catalysis 44 (1988) pages 73-83. The direct oxidation of
saturates to introduce functional groups such as ketones and alcohols using a
heterogeneous catalyst system would be extremely attractive.PCT patent application number GB 8901328 describes the use of catalysts based
on crystalline synthetic material comprising silicon and titanium oxides and are
characterised by an infra red absorption band at around 950 cm-1 to 960 cm-1
and typically of the general formula:
xTiO2(1-x)SiO2
where x is from 0.0001 to 0.04 for the oxidation of saturated hydrocarbons.These catalysts known as TS-1 and TS-2 are typically prepared in the absence of
aluminium from a mixture containing a source of silicon oxide, a source of
titanium oxide, a nitrogenated organic base and water as described in United
Kingdom Patent 207 1071 which is concerned with the catalysts themselves or by 
the dealumination of ZSM-5 and reaction with titanium tetrachloride vapour as
described by B. Kraushaar and J.H.C. Van Hoof in Catalysis Letters 1 (1988)
pages 81-84. The catalysts may contain small amounts of other metals such as
aluminium, gallium and iron (as described in European Patent Application
0226258).More recently aluminum containing titanium silicalites have been reported for
exa
