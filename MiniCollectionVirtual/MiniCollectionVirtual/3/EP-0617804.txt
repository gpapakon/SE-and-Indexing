<CLAIMS>
A control system for office machines, in particular photocopiers (10) or 
the like, comprising at least one replacement component (12 to 21) which 

must be replaced after a specific period of use, and at least one extent-of-use 
detector and a display unit (22-32) connected thereto to show 

the extent of use and/or the overstepping of a limit to the extent of use, 
characterised in that
 
a read/write unit is provided for a coded data carrier, in particular a 

magnetic or chip card (50), assigned to each inserted replacement 
component (12 - 21) and separated therefrom,
 
on introducing a coded data carrier into the read/write unit (48)the 

control system initiates the reading of an enabling code (EC) which it 

checks for validity and only in the event of a valid enabling code (EC) 
resets the extent-of-use detector to zero (block 74), and
 
having checked the validity of its enabling code, the control unit erases 

or overwrites said enabling code in a subsequent operation (block 78). 
Control system according to Claim 1,
 
characterised in that
 
the read/write unit (48) is designed as a separate component optionally 

connectable to the office machine. 
Control system according to one of the preceding Claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the read/write unit (48) is designed to read and/or write onto user data 

carriers, in particular counting cards or apparatus-setting cards. 
Control system according to one of the preceding Claims,
 
characterised in that
 
with several exchangeable office-machine replacement components (12 

to 21) each having different extent-of-use limits, a separate extent-of-use 
detector is assigned to each replacement component (12 to 21), and 

when a coded data carrier is introduced the control system initiates the 
reading of a replacement-component code (RCC) and resets the 

respective extent-of-use detector which is assigned to the replacement  
 

component (12 to 21) according to the replacement-component code 
(RCC). 
Control system according to one of the preceding Claims,
 
characterised in that
 
when a coded data carrier is introduced the control system detects the 

current extent-of-use status of a extent-of-use detector before actually 
resetting it and stores this on the coded data carrier (block 72). 
Control system according to one of the preceding Claims,
 
characterised in that
 
when a coded data carrier is introduced into the read/write unit the 

control system detects the current extent-of-use status of a device for 
detecting the total extent-of-use of the office machine and stores this on 

the coded data carrier (block 76). 
Control system according to one of the preceding Claims,
 
characterised in that
 
when a coded data carrier is introduced into the read/write unit the 

control system detects the current status of a device for detecting 
irregular operational conditions, in particular paper jams, and stores this 

on the coded data carrier (block 76). 
Control system according to one of the preceding Claims,
 
characterised in that
 
when a coded carrier is introduced into the read/write unit the control 

system detects the current status of a device for detecting regular 
operational conditions, e.g. the use of different paper trays or different 

reproduction scales, and stores this on the coded data carrier (block 76).
