<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the regulated epoxidation
of propylene. More particularly, this invention relates
to a continuous process for the regulated reaction of
propylene with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in solution in
tertiary butyl alcohol in the presence of an epoxidation
catalyst to provide propylene oxide and additional
tertiary butyl alcohol.The reaction of an olefin such as propylene with a
hydroperoxide such as tertiary butyl hydroperoxide in
solution in a solvent such as tertiary butyl alcohol in
the presence of a soluble molybdenum catalyst is disclosed
in Kollar U.S. Patent No. 3,351,635. Kollar teaches that,
in general, from about 0.5 to 100 moles of olefin may be
used per mole of hydroperoxide, the preferred molar ratio
being within the range of about 2 to about 10 moles of
olefin per mole of hydroperoxide.Marquis et al. in U.S. Patent No. 4,891,437 disclose
an improvement on the Kollar process in the reaction of
propylene 
with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide wherein the
reaction is conducted in a medium composed of 60 wt.% or more
of polar components which is formed by utilizing a molar ratio
of propylene to tertiary butyl hydroperoxide of about 0.5 to
2 moles of charged propylene per mole of charged hydroperoxide,
the reaction being conducted in solution in tertiary
butyl alcohol in the presence of a molybdenum catalyst.
Variations in the Marquis et al. process and in the preparation
of catalysts useful therefore are disclosed in Marquis
et al. U. S. Patent No. 4,845,251 and U. S. Patent No.
5,107,067.British Patent No. 1,298,253 discloses a process for the
staged reaction of propylene with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide
in the presence of tertiary butyl alcohol and a soluble
molybdenum catalyst wherein the reaction product from the
first stage is fractionated to provide a lighter fraction
which is recycled to the beginning of the first stage and a
heavier fraction which is charged to the second stage of the
epoxidation process.Marquis et al. U. S. Patent No. 4,992,566 and Marquis
et al. U. S. Patent No. 5,093,506 disclose single stage
processes for the reaction of propylene with tertiary butyl
hydroperoxide wherein the reaction product is fractionated to
provide a propylene stream for recycle.Russell U. S. Patent No. 3,418,340 discloses a process
for the production of propylene oxide by the reaction of 
propylene with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide involving a
recycle of the propylene wherein the propylene is further
fractionated to remove oxygen prior to recycle.Stein et al. U. S. Patent
