<ABSTRACT>
An inhalation device is provided by means of which material in powder form can be inhaled. A plurality of powder containers (205) each having a powder containing depression therein may be individually fed to a use station which cooperates with an inhalation means (214, 215, 216). The inhalation means (214, 215, 216) comprises an outlet (215) communicating with the open container (205) by a passage (216) which comprises a wall means which cooperates with the powder containing depression to define a venturi.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inhalation device for use in the inhalation of material
in powder form. More particularly, it relates to a device by means of which
medicament in powder form can be inhaled, and it is so described below.GB-A-2242134 describes an inhalation device in which at least one powder
container is defined between two members peelably secured to one another, the
device comprising means defining an opening station for the at least one
container, and means for peeling the members apart at the opening station to
open the container. The opened container registers with a passageway through
which an airflow may be generated by a user inhaling through a mouthpiece.
Powder is thus entrained in the airflow and inhaled. It has now been found that
the efficiency of powder entrainment in the airflow can be enhanced by
providing a container which cooperates with the passageway to define and
conform to an integral part of a venturi.According to the present invention there is provided an inhalation device by
means of which material in powder form can be inhaled, comprising means
holding a container having a powder-containing depression therein at a use
station, and inhalation means for enabling the powder to be inhaled from the
container at the use station, said inhalation means comprising an outlet
communicating with the container by a passage, said passage comprising wall
means which define a venturi, characterised in that the depression cooperates
with the wall means to define and conform to an integral part of the venturi.The use of a venturi is advantageous in that it provides for rapid and
substantially complete emptying of the container.The invention further provides for the use of such an inhalation means in an
inhalation device by means of which material in powder form can be inhaled,
comprising means for holding a stack of unused powder containers and storage 
means for receiving each used container from the use station after the powder
has been inhaled therefrom and collecting the containers therein.The invention additionally provides for the use of such an inhalation means in
an inhalation device as described in WO 92/00771 in which there is provided a
storage chamber for the powder to be inhaled and a metering member which is
intended to provide at least one dispensing cup defining the at least one powder
container, the said metering member being moveable between a first position in
which a container is presented to the storage chamber to receive a dose of the
powder to be inhaled and a

An inhalation device by means of which material in powder form can be
inhaled, comprising means holding a container (205) having a powder

containing depression (205a) therein at a use station, and inhalation
means for enabling the powder to be inhaled from the container (205,

412) at the use station, said inhalation means comprising an outlet (235,
251, 302, 404) communicating with the container by a passage (216,

240, 354, 356, 402), said passage comprising wall means which define
a venturi (258), characterised in that the depression (205a) cooperates

with the wall means to define and conform to an integral part of the
venturi (258).
A device according to claim 1 comprising means for holding at least one
unused powder container (205, 252, 308) and means for feeding the

said at least one container to the use station.
A device according to claim 2 comprising means for holding a stack
(204, 252, 308) of unused powder containers (205), and storage means

(207, 253) for receiving each used container from the use station after
the powder has been inhaled therefrom and collecting the containers

therein.
A device according to claim 2 in which said at least one powder
container is defined between two members peelably secured to one

another, the device comprising means defining an opening station for
the said at least one container; and means for peeling the members

apart at the opening station to open the container.
A device according to claim 4 in which the said two members comprise a
base sheet having at least one pocket (412) therein defining the said

depression and a lid sheet, the at least one pocket and the adjacent part
of the lid sheet defining the at least one container, the device

comprising drawing means for pulling the lid sheet and base sheet apart
at the opening station. 
A device according to claim 5 in which the base sheet and lid sheet are
elongate sheets which define a plurality of containers spaced along the

length thereof, the device being provided with indexing means for
indexing each container in turn to the use station.
A device according to claim 2 comprising a body defining a storage
chamber for the powder to be inhaled and a metering member which is

intended to provide at least one dispensing cup defining the at least one
powder container, the said metering member being moveable between a

first position in which a container is presented to the storage chamber to
receive a dose of the powder to be inhaled and a second position

defined by the use station.
