<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides for a method of accessing a 
communication medium that allows for isochronous and asynchronous 

communication traffic to share the same medium and the same 
transceivers of a plurality of communication stations (18,20;22,24) that 

communicate by way of a base station (14;16). The base station (14;16) 
controls the communication between the communication stations 

(18,20;22,24) and generates regular timing periods in which 
isochronous traffic (38;62,64) is sent to the stations (18,20;22,24) with 

a higher priority than any asynchronous traffic pending at the beginning 
of each timing period. Once the initial isochronous traffic (38;62,64) 

has accessed the medium, any further isochronous traffic retains access 
to the medium so that the asynchronous traffic (56,58;78) can only 

occur in that part of the frame period remaining after the isochronous 
traffic has accessed the medium.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of accessing a
communication medium.Communication traffic between communication apparatus, such as
a base station and a plurality of communication stations forming a Local
Area Network (LAN), can comprise asynchronous traffic or
isochronous traffic.Asynchronous traffic exhibits unpredictable traffic timing, at
which a fast burst of packets is generated, and while such traffic
requires fast response times in the stations, a wide range of
instantaneous packet delays can be tolerated provided the average delay
in the stations is within acceptable limits. An example of asynchronous
traffic communication is the communication that occurs between
computer systems when a file has to be transferred relatively
infrequently but at a high speed once the communication commences.
A large LAN bandwidth must be available to the asynchronous traffic to
allow for the fast transfer of the file.Communication-medium access protocols that are established
having regard to the above mentioned characteristics of asynchronous
stations are based on a so-called Distributed Access Protocol in which
the medium access procedure is shared by all the stations connected to
the medium. An example of a Distributed Access Protocol is the
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
protocol used as part of the Ethernet and IEEE 802.3 communication
protocols.Isochronous traffic requires a predictable channel bandwidth and
can tolerate a long average packet-delay in the stations provided the
variations in the delays of different packets are within narrow limits.
Also, isochronous packets that are not delivered within a specified delay
are generally discarded. The quality of the isochronous communication
depends upon the application requirements, but generally a pre-defined
bandwidth is required along with a bit-error-rate limit or packet-error-rate
limit. An example of isochronous traffic is so-called packetized-voice
traffic. This traffic comprises voice data in the form of a steady
stream of packets that needs a limited bandwidth and also a regular
delay characteristic to achieve a steady packet stream for the relatively 
long call duration. Other examples are industrial processes that need to
react to known situations or events at an accurately determinable time.
Networks that can handle isochronous traffic employ so-called
Connection Oriented access protocols in which a connection between the
stations is established and the stations are assigned a channel with a well
defined

<CLAIMS>
A method of accessing a communication medium of a local area
network (10,12) for isochronous and asynchronous communication between a plurality

of communication stations (18,20;22,24) which communicate by way of a base station
(14,16), CHARACTERIZED BY the steps of generating uniform timing periods in said

base station (14,16), accessing the medium each period with at least one isochronous
packet (38;62,64) from said base station (14,16) with a higher access priority than any

asynchronous packets pending at the commencement of each timing period, delaying
any asynchronous packets (56,58;78) to be transmitted by a communication station in

each timing period until said at least one isochronous packet (38;62,64) and any
isochronous traffic (42,44;74) transmitted in response thereto have attempted access to

said medium, and accessing said medium for transmission of said asynchronous packets
(56,58;78) by said communication station during the remainder of each timing period.
A method according to claim 1, wherein any asynchronous packets
pending in the base station (14,16) are delayed by the base station (14,16) when said at

least one isochronous packet (38;62,64) is to be sent.
A method according to claim 1 or 2, wherein an access delay of said
at least one isochronous packet (38;62,64) is less than an access delay for asynchronous

packets from said communication stations (18,20;22,24) to said base station (14,16).
A method according to claim 1,2 or 3, wherein one isochronous
packet (38) is transmitted from said base station (14,16) each timing period and said one

packet (38) contains all the isochronous communication data which is to be transmitted
to the communication stations (18,20;22,24) in that period.
A method according to claim 4, wherein each communication station
(18,20;22,24) having an asynchronous packet to transmit in a timing period receives

said one isochronous packet (38) to determine how much isochronous traffic will occur
in the period and adjust its access delay accordingly.
A method according to claim 1,2 or 3, wherein separate isochronous
packets (62,64) are transmitted from said base station (14,16) each timing period for

each isochronous communication station (18,20;22,24). 
A method according to claim 6, wherein the access delay period for
the separate isochronous packets (62,64) and any isochronous traffic (72,74) from the

communication stations in reply thereto is less than the access delay for asynchronous
traffic (78).
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
communication stations (18,20;22,24) are prevented from transmitting asynchronous

traffic for a predetermined period (60,70) at the timing period boundary.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein the
order in which said communication stations (18,20;22,24) receive incoming isochronous

traffic is randomized.
A method according to any one of the preceding claims, wherein
said medium comprises a wireless medium.
