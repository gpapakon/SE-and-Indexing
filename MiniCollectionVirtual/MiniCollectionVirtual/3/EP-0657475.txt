<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to compositions that are useful as
intermediates for dispersants used in lubricating oil compositions or as
dispersants themselves. In addition, some of these compositions are useful
in the preparation of novel high molecular weight dispersants that have
superior dispersant properties for dispersing sludge and varnish and superior
Viton Seal compatibility.The high molecular weight dispersants of the present invention also
advantageously impart fluidity modifying properties to lubricating oil
compositions sufficient to allow elimination of some proportion of viscosity
index improver from multigrade lubricating oil compositions that contain these
dispersants.Alkenyl-substituted succinic anhydrides have been used as
dispersants. Such alkenyl-substituted succinic anhydrides have been
prepared by various processes, including a thermal process (see, e.g., U.S.
Pat. No. 3,361,673) and a chlorination process (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.
3,172,892). The polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride ("PIBSA") produced by the
thermal process has been characterized as a monomer containing a double
bond in the product. Although the exact structure of chlorination PIBSA has
not been definitively determined, the chlorination process PIBSAs have been
characterized as monomers containing either a double bond, a ring, other
than a succinic anhydride ring and/or chlorine in the product. [See J. Weill and
B. Sillion, "Reaction of Chlorinated Polyisobutene with Maleic
Anhydride:Mechanism Catalysis by Dichloromaleic Anhydride," Revue de I
'Institut Francais du Petrole, Vol. 40, No. 1, pp. 77-89 (January-February,
1985).] Such compositions include one-to-one monomeric adducts (see, e.g.,
U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,219,666; 3,381,022) as well as adducts having polyalkenyl-derived
substituents adducted with at least 1.3 succinic groups per
polyalkenyl-derived substituent (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4.234,435).In addition, copolymers of maleic anhydrides and some aliphatic alphaolefins
have been prepared. The polymers so produced were useful for a 
variety of purposes, including dispersants for pigments and intermediates in
the preparation of polyesters by their reaction with polyols or polyepoxides.
However, olefins having more than about 30 carbon atoms were found to be
relatively unreactive. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,461,108; 3,560,455;
3,560,456; 3,560,457; 3,580,893; 3,706,704; 3,729,450; and 3,729 ,451).bU.S. Patent No. 5,112,507 shows copolymers of unsaturated acidic
reactants and high molecular weight olefins that
