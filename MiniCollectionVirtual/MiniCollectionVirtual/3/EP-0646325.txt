<ABSTRACT>
A pet food having an obesity-preventive effect comprises 5 
to 100 parts by weight of an indigestible dextrin containing at 

least 30% by weight of indigestible components, per 100 parts 
by weight of carbohydrate present in the pet food. The pet food 

permits the control of the blood-sugar level and the amount of 
insulin secreted in a pet animal in response to the oral 

ingestion of sugary substances without any reduction in the 
pet's taste to thus prevent and treat obesity of pets and 

deficiency in the glucose tolerance.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a pet food exhibiting an 
effect of preventing obesity. Recently, owners and keepers of pets such as dogs, cats, 
hamsters, rats, rabbits, monkeys and small-sized pigs have 
increasingly recognized these pets as members of their family 
and the health and longevity of these pets have become matters 
of great concern. In advanced countries, i.e., Europe and 
America including Japan, the eating habits of pets have been 
improved as the human diet has been enriched. As a result, the 
population of pets suffering from geriatric diseases 
represented by obesity and diabetes increases steadily because 
of supernutrition and unbalanced diet as well as lack of 
exercise. Under such social background, there has been 
investigated the development of a healthy pet food, in 
particular, having low contents of fats and oils and a low 
calorie for maintaining the health of pets and for improving 
the health thereof and a variety of formulated foods have 
already been on the market, but these pet foods have still 
sufferred from, for instance, problems of pets' taste. In respect of man, there has also been developed various  
 
agents for inhibiting an increase in the blood-sugar level and 
excess insulin-secretion for preventing normal person from 
suffering from obesity and/or diabetes. As such agents, there 
have been known, for instance, Acarbose (available from Bayer 
Yakuhin, Ltd.) and AO-128 (available from Takeda Chemical 
Industries, Ltd.) which are substances each having an effect of 
inhibiting the gastrointestinal absorption of sugar and starch 
and inhibitors for enzymes involved in digestion. However, both 
of them are medicines for treating human beings and it is 
difficult and dangerous for the consuming public to use them for 
the preventive purpose because of problems of safety such as 
those concerning side-effects. Moreover, polymers of glucose 
moieties repeatedly bonded through α-1,6 bonds such as 
isomaltotriose, dextran and pullulan have been known to have an 
effect of inhibiting an increase in the blood-sugar level in 
response to ingestion of sugar. It has also been known that 
isomaltotriose and dextran as such are absorbed and, in 
particular, dextran suffers from a problem of safety since it is 
proved that dextran exhibits side-effects such as an effect of 
elongating the blood-coagulation time. On the other hand, 
pullulan can inhibit any increase in the blood-sugar level after 
the ingestion of sugar, but is substantially ineffective for 
the control of

<CLAIMS>
A pet food having an obesity-preventive effect comprising 
5 to 100 parts by weight of an indigestible dextrin containing 

at least 30% by weight of indigestible components, per 100 
parts by weight of carbohydrate present in the pet food. 
The pet food of claim 1 wherein the amount of the 
indigestible dextrin ranges from 5 to 90 parts by weight per 100 

parts by weight of the carbohydrate present in the pet food. 
The pet food of claim 2 wherein the amount of the 
indigestible dextrin ranges from 10 to 40 parts by weight per 

100 parts by weight of the carbohydrate present in the pet food. 
The pet food of claim 1 wherein the content of the 
indigestible components present in the indigestible dextrin is 

at least 40% by weight. 
The pet food of claim 4 wherein the content of the 
indigestible components present in the indigestible dextrin is 

at least 50% by weight. 
The pet food of claim 1 wherein the content of the 
indigestible components present in the indigestible dextrin is 

at least 40% by weight and the amount of the indigestible 
dextrin ranges from 10 to 40 parts by weight per 100 parts by 

weight of the carbohydrate present in the pet food. 
The pet food of claim 1 wherein the indigestible dextrin 
is prepared by either of the following methods: 


(1) a small amount of an inorganic acid is added to starch in 
the powdery state, the mixture is heated to give pyrodextrin, 

 
then the dextrin is hydrolyzed with α-amylase and optionally 

refined; 
(2) the product prepared by the process (1) is further 
hydrolyzed with glucoamylase and optionally refined; 
(3) the product prepared by the process (2) is further subjected 
to ion exchange chromatography to separate and remove the 

glucose fraction from the product. 
The pet food of claim 1 wherein it is selected from the 
group consisting of dry type, semi-moist type, canned type and 

sausage type pet foods.
