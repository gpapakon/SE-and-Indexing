<ABSTRACT>
A control device for reducing a marking time in a
marking device. This control device performs control

operations whereby an image 
20
 of an area that
circumscribes the entire "ABCDE" pattern of an original

image is retrieved, the circumscribed area image 
20
 is
divided into a plurality of image segments 
19
 of a
predetermined size, and each of the plurality of image

segments 
21
 is sequentially displayed on a mask.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a device for
controlling a marking device designed to mark a
predetermined pattern on a work, and in particular
relates to a control device capable of performing high-speed
marking.A need for reducing the marking time has recently
arisen in the technical field related to marking devices,
including laser markers.In the past, to mark an "ABCDE" marking pattern
such as that shown in Figure 2 using the laser marker
shown in Figure 1, an entire original image 18 was
uniformly divided into image segments 19 of a
predetermined size, all these image segments 19 were
sequentially displayed on the display screen 10 of a
liquid-crystal mask 6, and actuators 12 and 16 for
switching an image-segment exposure position 17a on a
work 17 were driven in controlled fashion every time the
display was switched.In such cases, display switches and actuator
drive/control are also performed for image segments 19', 
which represent only the background outside of the
"ABCDE" marking pattern, This means that so-called blank
spaces are also marked, and the time for display switches
and the like is wasted. The same is true for images such
as an image segment 19'', where the marking pattern
occupies only a small share of the entire image 19''.In the laser marker shown in Figure 1, a laser
beam bm strikes the display screen 10 of the liquid-crystal
mask 6, and the entire display screen 10 is
marked by scanning the laser beam, as shown in Figure 16.
Main scanning of the display screen 10 in the X direction
is effected by the rotation of a polygonal mirror 3, and
sub scanning in the Y direction is effected by the
rotation of a scanning mirror 2.In the past, to continue to perform main scanning
once the preceding cycle of main scanning had been
completed, it was necessary to vary the rotational speed
of the scanning mirror 2 in steps from zero speed and to
proceed from an initial sub scanning position Y1 to a
next sub scanning position Y2.Such a stepwise scanning mode does not pose any
problems when the polygonal mirror 3 rotates at a low
speed and the main scanning is performed at a low speed, 
but it is impossible to track when the main scanning is
performed at a fast speed, and undesirable vibration
results.An object of the present invention, which
was devised in view of this situation, is to reduce the
marking time by raising the scanning speed of the display
screen of the mask without impairing the tracking
properties or bringing about other disadvantages.When an image such as that shown in Figure 24

<CLAIMS>
A control device of a marking device which comprises a
scanning device (2,3) for exposing a display screen (10) of

a liquid-crystal mask (6) to light and subjecting the exposure
light both to main scanning at a predetermined speed

in an X direction across the display screen (10) and to sub
scanning at a predetermined speed in a Y direction that is

perpendicular to the X direction, in which images (18) indicative
of a pattern (ABCDE) to be marked are displayed on

the display screen (10) of the mask (6) and the light is
scanned by the scanning device (2,3) so as to guide the

light passing through the mask toward a work (17) and to
mark the pattern on the work,characterized in that

the control device controls the scanning device (2,3) in
such a way that the sub scanning is performed at a constant

speed during the sub scanning of the display screen (10) of
the mask (6).
A control device of a marking device as defined in claim 1,
wherein the sub scanning is performed at the constant speed

when a speed of the main scanning exceeds a predetermined
threshold value.
A control device of a marking device as defined in claim 1
or 2, wherein the speed of the sub scanning is determined

by a time needed to perform one cycle of main scanning, the
number of times the display screen undergoes main scanning,

and a length of the display screen in the Y direction.
A control device of a marking device as defined in claim 3,
wherein the number of times the main scanning is performed

is determined by a diameter of the beam irradiated on the
display screen and by the length of the display screen in

the Y direction.
