<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a process for removing iron from phosphoric 
acid prepared by the wet process. Phosphoric acid is prepared by the wet process by allowing a 
mineral acid, most commonly sulfuric acid, to react with a 
calcium phosphate concentrate, whereby a dilute phosphoric 
acid, containing approx. 30 % P₂O₅, and a calcium sulfate precipitate 
are formed. After filtration, the acid contains many 
kinds of anionic impurities, such as sulfate and fluorine compounds, 
and cationic impurities, the most important of which 
are iron, aluminum, magnesium and calcium, as well as organic 
impurities. The quantity and type of the impurities are dependent 
primarily on the crude phosphate used as the raw material. The dilute acid is concentrated by evaporation to a concentration 
of 50-60 % P₂O₅, whereby the volatile impurities such as 
fluorine compounds are removed along with the evaporating water 
vapor, but the concentrations of other impurities increase. Many kinds of purification processes have been developed for 
the purification of wet phosphoric acid so that the concentrations 
of the impurities could be reduced to such a level that 
the acid could be used for even other purposes than the production 
of fertilizers. It is known to use an electrothermal purification process. By 
the electrothermal process it is possible to prepare a phosphoric 
acid having a low iron content, but the process consumes 
a high amount of energy and is therefore expensive. From GB patent publication 1 588 413 there is known a process 
for removing iron from wet phosphoric acid, wherein the iron is 
precipitated by using an alkali ferrocyanide or ammonium ferrocyanide.  
 
However, owing to the toxicity of cyanides, and 
especially of hydrocyanic acid, the process is not very attractive. It is further known to extract the phosphoric acid by means of 
organic solvents, from which it is re-extracted into an aqueous 
phase and is concentrated. Most of the iron remains in the 
aqueous phase, from which it can be removed together with the 
raffinate. However, sufficiently low iron concentrations have 
not been achieved by extraction; an additional purification 
step has been required, such as the removing of iron from an 
organic phase by the use of anionic ion exchange resins (US 
patent publication 5 006 319), or it has been necessary to 
carry out other procedures (EP application publication 
327 234). Another disadvantage of the process is that it is 
expensive. The produced extract is dilute with respect to
