<ABSTRACT>
A use of a compound of the formula 

wherein R is an alkyl, R¹ is a hydrogen or an amino and R² is a 
carboxyl or a tetrazole, or a salt thereof for the production of 

a composition for the prophylaxis and treatment of myopia. The 
use for the prophylaxis and treatment of myopia of the present 

invention not only results in relaxing action on the ciliary 
smooth muscle of rabbit, but also brings about superior effects 

of prevention and treatment of myopia of the patients on whom 
Mydrin-M, a conventional preparation for the prophylaxis and 

treatment of myopia, failed to have effects. In addition, the 
use does not involve a mydriatic response and is advantageous 

for the prophylaxis and treatment of myopia.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a composition for the
prophylaxis and treatment of myopia.Myopia is defined as the state wherein parallel rays of
light entering the eye are brought to focus before retina.Myopia generally includes the following two kinds. One is
axial myopia. This is caused by abnormally long axis of the eye
when lens power is normal, and severe myopia is often found in
this kind. The axial myopia generally starts from infancy and
the axis of the eye gradually grows and abnormalities are
developed in fundus oculi. Specifically, atrophy of retina and
chorioidea, abnormal increase and decrease of pigments,
clouding of vitreous body, retinal hemorrhage to result in
detachment of the retina and even losing eyesight can be
observed.The other is refractive myopia. This is caused by abnormal
curvature of cornea or acquired increase in the thickness of
the lens due to reading, close work for the eye such as VDT
(visual display terminal) work, etc. to result in too strong a
power of cornea and lens. Included therein is pseudomyopia
which is caused by unfixed state of continuing and growing
contraction of the ciliary smooth muscle. The pseudomyopia is
the state of thickened lens as in refractive myopia before the 
instillation of a cycloplegia. After the instillation of a
cycloplegia, however, the thickness of the lens becomes less and
refractive error shifts toward the hyperopia side by 1 D
(diopter) or more.Clear distinction between these two kinds of myopia (axial
myopia and refractive myopia), however, is very difficult to
make and the coexistence of the two is said to be frequently
seen. At present, it is commonly understood that the close work
for the eye is one of the causes of myopia, though the cause of
myopia still remains to be clarified. More specifically, when
close work for the eye is done, contraction of ciliary smooth
muscle makes the lens thicken. Continuation of this state for
an extended period of time results in failure to restore to its
original state, which in turn causes substrate change of
ciliary smooth muscle to result in refractive myopia, which
further causes fragile posterior membrane of the eye to permit
growing axis of the eye, thus causing axial myopia.Alternatively, alleviation of the contractile state of
ciliary smooth muscle is said to cure myopia. For this end,
local administration (instillation) of a drug such as
tropicamide is done for alleviating the tension of ciliary
smooth muscle. Yet, the efficacy of the drug differs among
patients and is not entirely
