<ABSTRACT>
The needle selection device for circular knitting 
machines has multiple selectors (1) arranged in the axial 

grooves (2) formed in the skirt of the needle cylinder (3), each 
selector being arranged below a needle (5) and oscillatable in 

a radial plane of the needle cylinder from an active 
position, in which it protrudes radially from its groove 

with a butt (9), for the engagement of the butt with cams (7) for 
actuating the selectors arranged around the needle cylinder 

to move the selectors along their groove in the needle 
cylinder so as to activate the overlying needle (5), to an 

inactive position, in which the selector is sunk in its 
groove in the needle cylinder so that it does not interfere 

with the selector actuation cams (7). The device has selector 
extraction means to transfer the selectors from the 

inactive position to the active position and selection 
means to transfer the selectors from the active position to 

the inactive position or to keep them in the active 
position. Each selector is provided with a selection 

element (12) protruding radially from the grooves of the needle 
cylinder and oscillatable in the plane of arrangement of 

its selector (1). The selection element (12) is made of a material 
that can be magnetized, and an electromagnet (18) is provided 

for magnetizing the selection element and magnetic means 
interact with the selection element after its magnetization 

to make it oscillate into an idle position, in which the 
selection element (12) engages a selector sinker cam (15) which 

laterally faces the needle cylinder (3), or into an active 
position, wherein the selection element does not interfere 

with the sinker cam to keep its selector in the active 
position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a needle selection 
device for circular knitting machines for manufacturing 
socks, stockings or the like. As is known, in knitting machines for manufacturing 
socks, stockings or the like there are needle selection 
devices which, by selecting the needles to be moved to knit 
at a feed of the machine, allow to produce particular 
patterns or designs. In some types of circular machine said selection 
devices comprise multiple selectors individually arranged 
in one of the grooves formed in the skirt of the needle 
cylinder below the related needle. Said selectors can 
individually oscillate in the radial plane of the needle 
cylinder in which they are arranged from an active 
position, in which they protrude radially with a butt from 
the related groove of the needle cylinder so as to engage, 
by means of said butt, a selector actuation cam that moves 
them along their groove so as to move the overlying needle 
to knit, to an inactive position in which the selector is 
fully sunk with its butt inside its groove so that it does 
not engage the selector actuation cams, keeping the 
overlying needle in idle position, i.e. in a position in 
which the needle does not pick up the thread at the 
following feed of the machine. The oscillation of the 
selectors from the inactive position to the active position 
is performed by means of extraction cams which can be of 
the fixed type, i.e. fixed to the support of the needle 
cylinder, or of the movable type so that they can be  
 
activated or deactivated by command. Downstream of the 
extraction cams, along the direction of the rotation of the 
needle cylinder about its axis with respect to said cams, 
there are actuation means which perform the actual selection 
of the selectors according to the type of design or pattern 
to be produced. Some of these selection means are simply 
constituted by levers which laterally face the needle 
cylinder and are arranged at a level corresponding to the 
position of secondary butts of the selector. Said levers can 
be actuated so as to interfere with said secondary butts in 
order to move the selector into its inactive position, 
avoiding its subsequent engagement with the actuation cam, 
or can be moved into such a position as to not interfere 
with the secondary butts of the selector in order to keep 
the related selector in the extraction position produced by 
the preceding action of the extraction cams. In some types of selection device said levers are 
actuated by means of
