<ABSTRACT>
A double molded product is produced by secondary 
molding a primary molded product with a resin, the primary 

molded product comprising, a connector portion accommodating 
at least one wire, and an inside-outside communication 

portion communicating the inside of a mold with outside 
during a secondary molding. The inside-outside communication 

portion comprises, at least one notch for respectively 
holding the wires extending form inside of the mold to the 

out side.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a double moulded product, and
more particularly to a double moulded product in which
wires are mounted on a primary moulded product, and then a
resin is moulded on this primary moulded product.DE-A-41 30 603 shows a holder for round flexible wires
having stress relieve means. The holder is in form of a
casing being constituted by two casing halves. One half has
protruding bifurcated holding tongues for receiving the cables
at part of a periphery thereof and the other half has
pressing means for intruding between two adjacent cantilevers
of two adjacent holding tongues in order to press them
apart and so all pressing means simultaneously press the
cantilevers of all holding tongues together with the respective
wires therebetween.DE-U-87 02 058 shows a connector for a wire harness of
an automobile. The connector is constituted by two halves,
which are connected by a hinge portion. The harness is led
into one half of the opened connector, is spread and led
into individual contact portions. After this, the two connector
halves are closed and by doing so, the individual
wires of the wire harness are fixed in place.However, both in DE-A-41 30 603 and DE-U-87 02 058 the
wires are held or clamped mechanically and not by a moulding
operation.A conventional double moulded product is disclosed in
EP-A-0 519 709 corresponding to JP-A-4 369 515. What is
disclosed is a double moulded connector. As shown in Figs.
6 and 7 of the accompanying drawings, a connector portion
1a for holding wires 3, which has a fitting terminal 2
clamped to a front end thereof, is formed at an upper portion
of a primary moulded product 1. An inside-outside communication
portion 1b for communicating the inside of a 
mould with the outside of the mould during a double moulding
operation is formed at a lower portion of the primary
moulded product. The inside-outside communication portion
1b has through holes 1b1 for the passage of the wires 3
therethrough, respectively.For producing the connector of such a construction, the
fitting terminal 2 is compressively clamped to one end of
the wire 3, and this end portion is held by the connector
portion 1a, and the other end of the wire 3 is passed
through the through hole 1b1 in the inside-outside communication
portion 1b. Then, the connector portion 1a is placed
in moulds, with the inside-outside communication portion 1b
held between the moulds. After a resin moulding, a double
moulded product 4 is completed as shown in Figs. 8 and 9.Thus, the primary moulded product is
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A double moulded product which is produced by secondary
moulding a primary moulded product with a resin,

said primary moulded product comprising:

a connector portion (11) accommodating at least one
wire (W);
an inside-outside communication portion (12) communicating
the inside of a mould with the outside during said

secondary moulding, said inside-outside communication portion
(12) comprising at least one notch (12a1
~
12a4) for respectively
accomodating the wire (W) extending from the inside

of said mould to the outside; and
a lid portion (12c) for closing said notch
(12a1
~
12a4), with the wire (W) held respectively in said
notch (12a1
~
12a4),

   characterized in that

said notch (12a1
~
12a4) includes a wire retaining portion
for retaining the wire at an inner end portion of said

notch (12a1
~
12a4), and
said lid (12c) comprising at least one holder piece
(12c1
~
12c4) corresponding respectively to said at least one
notch (12a1
~
12a4) and being receivable therein, the width
of said at least one holder piece (12c1
~
12c4) being equal
to the width of said at least one notch (12a1
~
12a4) and the
distal end of said at least one holder piece (12c1
~
12c4)
being recessed into a semi-circular shape corresponding to

a semi-circular shape of the inner end portion of said at
least one notch (12a1
~
12a4) such that when the distal end
of said holder piece (12c1
~
12c4) and the inner end of said
notch (12a1
~
12a4) are disposed in facing relation to each
other, they jointly form a cylindrical hole surrounding the

periphery of said wire (W) sealingly.
The double moulded product according to claim 1,
wherein a plurality of notches (12a1
~
12a4) is provided in
said connector portion (11) and a corresponding plurality

of holder pieces (12c1
~
12c4) is provided in said lid (12c)
for holding a plurality of wires (W).
The double moulded product according to claim 2,
wherein said notches (12a1
~
12a4) are tapered such that opposed
side surfaces (12f1, 12f2) thereof getting closer to

each other progressively toward the inner end to gradually
reduce the width and said holder pieces (12c1
~
12c4) are tapered
such that opposed side surfaces thereof getting closer

to each other progressively toward the distal end
thereof.
The double moulded product according to claim 3,
wherein the inner ends of said notches (12a1
~
12a4) open into
a cylindrical wire holder groove (12f3).
