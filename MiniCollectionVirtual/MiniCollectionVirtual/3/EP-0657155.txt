<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bed, in particular a
hospital bed, comprising a bed frame structure. The bed
frame structure is provided with a head side end portion
thereof and a foot side end portion thereof, the end
portions each comprising a laterally extending end bar.
Each of the end bars is provided for carrying a
substantially U-shaped bar and for carrying a
panel extending within an area surrounded by the
U-shaped bar and the end bar.GB 2 252 237 A discloses a bed according to the preamble part of
claim 1, the
U-shaped bar of which bed is
used for manoeuvering the bed when positioning the same in
a hospital room or moving it on the floor. Further, such a
U-shaped bar may be used for attaching a plurality of
different accessories to the bed. The panels provided on
the foot side end portion and the head side end portion
serve for defining respective end faces of the bed in
order to improve the appearance of the hospital beds and
to fasten different accessories to the bed, for example, a
table showing a patient's medical history, etc.
Additionally, the panels can be used instead of the
U-shaped bar for moving the bed. For providing the 
hospital bed with other accessories the panels may be
detached from the bed in order to allow the fixing of
other accessories to respective end bars of the bed and to
provide free access to the bed from the foot side or the
head side.The panel of this known hospital bed is carried by the side
legs of portions of the U-shaped bar by means of several
carrying studs horizontally projecting from said side leg
portions and being engaged by a U-shaped connection part
projecting from said panel. Therefore, the panel can be
mounted to the bed only in case the U-shaped bar is also
mounted to the bed. The carrying studs and connection
parts impede effective cleaning and desinfection of the
hospital bed and have a negative effect on its outer
appearance. In some cases the panel is even fixed to the
U-shaped bar so that there is no possibility of removing
the panel from the end bar without removing the respective
U-shaped bar.From DE G 92 10 504.1 there is known a hospital bed in which a U-shaped
manoeuvring bar is fixed to an end bar of the bed. A panel is fixed to
respective side leg portions of the U-shaped manoeuvring bar such that the
panel is arranged in a space surrounded by the U-shaped manoeuvring bar and
the end bar of the bed.At the end portions of the side legs there is provided a cylindrical portion and
a frustoconical portion which are adapted for insertion
