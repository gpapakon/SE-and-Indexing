<ABSTRACT>
An air-fuel ratio control system for an internal 
combustion engine having a first and second groups of 

cylinders and first and second catalytic converters 
arranged respectively in first and second exhaust 

systems extending from the respective cylinder groups, 
includes first and second upstream oxygen sensors 

upstream of the catalytic converters, and a single 
downstream oxygen sensor downstream of the catalytic 

converters. The air-fuel ratios of air-fuel mixtures 
supplied into the first and second cylinder groups are 

controlled by the use of first and second air-fuel ratio 
control amounts based on outputs from the respective 

first and second upstream oxygen sensors and the 
downstream oxygen sensor, when the engine is in a 

predetermined operating condition. The air-fuel ratio 
of an air-fuel mixture supplied into one of the first 

and second cylinder groups is controlled by the use of a 
third air-fuel ratio control amount based solely on an 

output from the downstream oxygen sensor, and the air-fuel 
ratio of an air-fuel mixture supplied into the 

other cylinder group by the use of a predetermined 
value, when the engine is in an operating condition 

other than the predetermined operating condition, 
whereby deterioration of the first or second catalytic 

converter is detected based on the downstream oxygen 
sensor output.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an air-fuel ratio 
control system for an internal combustion engine having 
a plurality of cylinder groups, which carries out air-fuel 
ratio control per cylinder group, e.g. for each 
bank in the case of a V-type engine, and more 
particularly, to an air-fuel ratio control system of 
this kind, which is capable of detecting deterioration 
of catalytic converters arranged in the exhaust system. There is conventionally known an air-fuel ratio 
control system for internal combustion engines, which 
has oxygen concentration sensors (hereinafter referred 
to as "the O2 sensors") arranged, respectively, 
upstream and downstream of a three-way catalyst as a 
catalytic converter arranged in the exhaust system of 
the engine, and carries out air-fuel ratio feedback 
control by calculating a feedback control amount (air-fuel 
ratio control amount) for controlling the air-fuel 
ratio of an air-fuel mixture supplied to the engine 
(hereinafter referred to as "the supplied air-fuel 
ratio"), based on outputs from the upstream and 
downstream O2 sensors. A system of this kind carries out air-fuel ratio 
control by correcting the air-fuel ratio of a mixture 
supplied to each cylinder to the same value. To detect 
deterioration of a three-way catalyst used in an  
 
internal combustion engine employing the above air-fuel 
ratio control method, a method of detecting a 
deterioration degree of the catalyst has been proposed, 
e.g. by Japanese Provisional Patent Publication (Kokai) 
No. 63-97852, which comprises calculating the number of 
times of inversion of outputs from the downstream O2 
sensor for a predetermined time period when the engine 
is in a predetermined operating condition, and 
determining that the catalyst is deteriorated when the 
calculated number of times of inversion exceeds a 
predetermined value. In addition to the above-mentioned air-fuel 
ratio control method, there is also known another air-fuel 
ratio control method, as proposed by U.S. Patent 
No. 5,228,287, in which air-fuel ratio feedback control 
is carried out based on air-fuel ratio control amounts 
which are different between the cylinder groups. This 
air-fuel ratio control method which controls per 
cylinder group is superior in air-fuel ratio control 
accuracy to the above-mentioned method, and includes 
various types, such as a method which controls per bank 
(right bank and left bank) for a V-type engine, and a 
method which controls per cylinder group (a first group 
consisting of #1 and #4 cylinders and a
