<ABSTRACT>
Described is a motor-driven appliance (10) for personal use, such as a mouth-care or tooth-care appliance, shaver or the like, with a housing (12) designed to accommodate the drive means (20) plus at least one rechargeable energy-storage cell (18). The housing (12) is made up of at least two parts (13, 14) which are connected together to form a tight seal. Associated with the appliance (10) is a housing structure (22) with, in particular, means (24) for charging the energy-storage cells (18) or, in particular, means (26) for holding accessories for the appliance (10). The housing structure (22) has two supports which are in integral part of the housing structure (22) and form a tool designed to separate the parts (13, 14) of the housing.

<CLAIMS>
A motor-powered appliance for personal use (10) 
as, for example, an appliance for oral or dental hygiene, 

a shaver or the like, with a housing (12) for accommodating 
the drive means (20) as well as at least one 

rechargeable energy-storage cell (18), with the housing 
(12) being composed of at least two housing sections (13, 

14) sealingly connectible with each other, and with the 
appliance (10) having an associated case structure (22) 

incorporating in particular means (24) for charging the 
energy-storage cells (18), or in particular means (26) 

for the storage of attachments for the appliance (10), 

characterized in that
 the case structure (22) includes 
two abutment means which, in forming an integral part of 

the case structure (22), provide a tool for severing the 
housing sections (13, 14). 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the abutment 
means are disposed in offset relation to each other at a 

relative distance corresponding approximately to the 
axial length of one of the housing sections (13, 14). 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the 
abutment means are configured as a locating means (29) 

and a stop means (31). 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in 
that
 a receiving opening (23) and an inner wall (25) of 
the receiving opening (23) form the two abutment means.  

 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in 
that
 the one abutment means is formed by a back panel 
(32) of the case structure (22), while the second abutment 

means is formed by an intermediate bottom (34) of 
the case structure (22). 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in 
that
 the back panel (32) of the case structure (22) includes 
a cutout (36), and that the cutout (36) and the 

housing (12) have essentially like cross-sections of 
mating diameter. 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the case structure 
(22) includes a dome (38) and a surface (40) opposite 

the dome (38), and that the dome (38) provides the 
one abutment means and the opposite surface (40) the 

second abutment means. 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the housing 
(12) is provided with a recess (16) for receiving the 

dome (38), and that the recess (16) is essentially configured 
such that its surface area is in abutting engagement 

with the dome (38). 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 7 or claim 8, 
characterized in that
 the 
surface (40) opposite the dome (38) is curved essentially 

cylindrically and the housing (12) is preferably of a 
cylindrical configuration, and that the curved surface 

(40) and the housing (12) have essentially like radii of 
curvature.  

 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in any one of the claims 1 to 9, 
characterized in 
that
 the two abutment means are formed by the receiving 
opening (23). 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 10, 
characterized in that
 the receiving 
opening (23) has an inside diameter corresponding essentially 

to the outside diameter of the housing (12). 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 10 or claim 11, 
characterized in that
 
the receiving opening (23) is preferably arranged in an 

end panel (33) of the case structure (22). 
A method of severing housing sections of a 
motor-powered appliance for personal use, as claimed in 

any one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 it 
involves the following steps: 


1. Introducing the section (14) of the housing 
(12) into the case structure (22) such that the 

housing section (14) is arranged between the 
abutment means; 
2. holding the case structure (22) with the one of 
the user's hands; and 
3. swinging the housing (12) with the other of the 
user's hands in the manner of a lever, in which 

process the housing section (14) is located in 
position by the abutment means. 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 
claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 both abutment 
means are provided on the dome (38).  

 
The motor-powered appliance for personal use as 

claimed in claim 14, 
characterized in that
 the one abutment 
means is provided by the dome (38) while the second 

abutment means is provided by a lug-shaped protuberance 
(42) arranged on one side of the dome (38). 
A method of severing housing sections of a 
motor-powered appliance for personal use, as claimed in 

any one of the claims 14 or 15, 
characterized in that
 it 
involves the following steps: 


1. Manually seating the one section (14) of the 
housing (12) onto the case structure (22), such 

that the dome (38) is received within the 
recess (16); 
2. holding the housing (12) with one of the user's 
hands, while the user's other hand holds the 

case structure (22); and 
3. rotating the housing (12) about a longitudinal 
center line (54).
