<ABSTRACT>
A rotary distributor type fuel pumping apparatus has two pairs of 
plungers (12, 13) housed in respective diametrical bores (11) which 

intersect each other. One of the plungers is longer than the remaining 
plungers conveniently by providing an extension (13A) at its inner end. 
The extension lies in the paths of movement of the remaining plungers 
so as to minimise the risk of damage to the plungers.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a rotary distributor type fuel pumping
apparatus for supplying fuel to an internal combustion engine, the
apparatus comprising a rotary distributor member mounted for rotation in
a housing, at least three pumping plungers mounted in radial drillings
respectively formed in the distributor member, the axes of the drillings
lying in a common radial plane and the drillings at their inner ends
intersecting to form a common pumping space, an annular cam ring
surrounding the distributor member and having a plurality of cam lobes
formed on its internal peripheral surface whereby during rotation of the
distributor member inward movements will be imparted to the pumping
plungers to displace fuel from the pumping space to an outlet, and
means for supplying fuel to the pumping space to effect outward
movement of the plungers.In one example of the apparatus which has four pumping
plungers it is usual to arrange the plungers in two pairs with the drillings
associated with each pair of plungers forming part of a diametrically
disposed bore. The two bores may be disposed at right angles to each
other or at some other angle depending upon the type of engine to
which fuel is to be supplied. Moreover, it is the practice to arrange that
the plungers in one of the bores are longer than the plungers in the other
bore so that at the limit of their inward movement the inner ends of the
longer plungers almost touch and the inner ends of the shorter plungers
almost touch the sides of the longer plungers. In this way the volume of
fuel which remains in the pumping space at the end of the inward
movement of the pumping plungers is kept to a minimum which is
advantageous from the point of view of consistency of operation of the 
apparatus.When the apparatus is at rest there is a tendency for the
uppermost plunger to move downwardly under the action of gravity but
even when the remaining plungers are at the outermost limits of their
travel and it is one of the shorter plungers which moves downwardly, its
movement has been halted by its engagement with a side surface or
surfaces of one or the longer plungers. There has therefore been no
problem when trying to start the associated engine. If however, the
stroke of the plungers is increased in order to increase the volume of fuel
which can be supplied by the apparatus, it has been shown to be
possible in the situation outlined above for a shorter one of the plungers
to move between the inner ends of the two longer plungers. As a result
when the associated

A rotary distributor type fuel pumping apparatus for supplying
fuel to an internal combustion engine, the apparatus comprising a rotary

distributor member (10) mounted for rotation in a housing (17), at least
three pumping plungers (12, 13) mounted in radial drillings (11)

respectively formed in the distributor member, the axes of said drillings
lying in a common radial plane and the drillings at their inner ends

intersecting to form a common pumping space (16A), an annular cam
ring (15) surrounding the distributor member (10) and having a plurality

of cam lobes (16) formed on its internal peripheral surface whereby
during rotation of the distributor member inward movements will be

imparted to the pumping plungers to displace fuel from the pumping
space to an outlet (20), and means (23) for supplying fuel to the pumping

space characterised in that one of said plungers (13) is longer than all
remaining plungers so that at its outermost position the inner end of said

one plunger lies in the paths of movement of all remaining plungers. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised in that said
one plunger has an extension (13A) at its inner end.
