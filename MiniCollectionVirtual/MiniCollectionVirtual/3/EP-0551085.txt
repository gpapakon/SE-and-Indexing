<ABSTRACT>
A male electrical terminal (10) is stamped and 
formed from sheet metal material and includes a rear 

terminating portion (12) and a front mating portion (14). The 
mating portion is formed by at least three forwardly extending 

cantilevered beams (34) to allow inward flexing movement of 
the beams relative to each other. The beams are formed with 

inwardly tapered free ends (38) positioned and configured 
relative to each other such that each inwardly tapered free 

end is engageable with an edge (40) of at least another 
inwardly tapered free end when any beam is over-flexed 

inwardly to provide complementarily interengaging anti-overstress 
means between the beams.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of 
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a male terminal or 
pin which includes a plurality of flexible beams provided with 
anti-overstress means between the beams. Mating electrical connectors often are provided with 
complementarily mating male and female terminals or contacts. 
The female terminal provides a receptacle or socket for the 
male terminal. Male terminals are provided in a variety of 
configurations, ranging from flat blades, to solid pins, to 
stamped and formed components having flexible beams and other 
similar constructions. One type of male terminal is constructed with a 
plurality of cantilevered beams surrounding an open area 
therebetween, whereby the beams can flex inwardly when 
inserted into a female terminal and thereby exert outwardly 
directed contact forces between the terminals. Normally, such 
male terminals, of the cantilevered beam construction, are 
unitarily fabricated of stamped and formed sheet metal 
material. One of the problems with male terminals of the 
cantilevered beam configuration is that the beams may become  
 
over-stressed in an inward direction and thereby lose their 
resilient capabilities of exerting outwardly directed contact 
forces. In other words, the beams can become overly bent 
inwardly toward one another. This overstressing can occur 
during handling, shipping, abusive use or even in subsequent 
manufacturing operations after the terminal is formed, such as 
plating and like processes. This invention is directed to solving such problems 
by providing a male terminal with cantilevered contact beams 
which are provided with complementarily interengaging anti-overstress 
means therebetween. An object, therefore, of the invention is to provide 
a new and improved male electrical terminal with anti-overstress 
means, of the character described. In the exemplary embodiment of the invention, the 
male electrical terminal is stamped and formed from sheet 
metal material and includes a rear terminating portion and a 
front mating portion. The mating portion is formed by at 
least three forwardly extending cantilevered beams to allow 
inward flexing movement of the beams relative to each other. 
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, four 
cantilevered beams are arranged in a box-like array whereby 
any one beam is generally perpendicular to a pair of the other 
beams along opposite sides of the one beam. The invention contemplates that inwardly tapered 
free ends of the cantilevered beams be
