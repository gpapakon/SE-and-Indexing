<DESCRIPTION>
 VEHICLE WINDOW AND A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOFThis invention relates to the mounting or installation of vehicle windows and, more specifically to vehicle windows which are mounted or installed through the use of an adhesive.It is known to mount vehicle windows in a vehicle through the use of an adhesive such as, for example, a moisture-curable urethane adhesive. In such a mounting procedure, the edge of the window is glued to a flange of a vehicle body. In such procedures, however, it is usual ly necessary to apply the moisture-curable adhesive to the wi ndow j ust prior to the mounting of the window, since exposure to atmospheric moisture prior to mounting will, over a period of time, cause the adhesive to cure and lose its ability to bond effectively to the vehicle flange. However, if the adhesive is applied just prior to mounting of the window, the vehicle manufacturer must purchase, operate, and maintain a substantial amount of pumping and dispensing equipment, as well as store substantial quantities of the moisture-curable adhesive. In addition, in the case of automotive windshields, the vehicle manufacturer may also need to maintain a full line of pumping and dispensing equipment to apply one or more glass primers (usually a clear primer followed by a wiping operation, followed by the application of a "blackout" primer) to the glass surface prior to the application of the moisture-curable adhesive. It is also known to pre-apply moisture curable adhesive to a window, and then cover the adhesive with a moisture-proof foil in such a manner that the foil does not touch the bead of adhesive. The air enclosed in the foil is then evacuated and the package is filled with a dry protection gas. Upon application, the foil is completely removed to expose the uncured adhesive, as described in U.S. Patent 4,879,853. U.S. Patent 4,879,853 also describes a process for pre-applying moisture curable adhesive to a window by first preparing a cured bead of adhesive adhered to the window in the shape of a receptacle for a second bead of uncured adhesive, placing a bead of moisture- -curable adhesive in the receptacle which does not completely fill the receptacle, and then placing a covering over the receptacle which does not touch the uncured bead of adhesive. Upon application, the foil is completely removed from the receptacle to expose the uncured adhesive.It would be desirable to develop a process for the pre-application of a moisture curable adhesive which does not require the use of protection gases or

 1. A process for preparing a prefabricated vehicle window comprising the sequential steps of:
(a) placing a cover film in a receptacle to provide a film cavity, with a portion of the cover film extending overthe sides of the receptacle; (b) depositing a bead of an uncured, deformable bead of adhesive in the cavity in an amount sufficient to slightly overfill the cavity;
(c) contacting the bead of adhesive with a vehicle window under conditions sufficient to press adhesive out of the cavity and between the vehicle window and the portions of the cover film extending overthe sides of the receptacle in an amount sufficient to bond the film to the entire periphery of the window along the inboard and outboard edges of the bead of adhesive.
2. The process of Claim 1 wherein the receptacle has a "U "-shaped cross section.
3. The process of Claim 1 wherein the receptacle has a " V"-shaped cross section.
4. A process for preparing a prefabricated vehicle window comprising the sequential steps of:
(a) placing a cover film in a receptacle to provide a film cavity, with a portion of the cover film extending over the sides of the receptacle, and depositing a first bead of a hardenable adhesive material along the edge portion of one side of the vehicle window and allowing such bead to harden;
(b) depositing a bead of an uncured, deformable bead of adhesive in the cavity in an amount sufficient to slightly overfill the cavity;
(c) contacting the bead of adhesive with one side of a vehicle window or the hardened adhesive material under conditions sufficient to press adhesive out of the cavity and between the vehicle window or the hardened adhesive material and the portions of the cover film extending over the sides of the receptacle in an amount sufficient to bond the film to the window or the hardened adhesive material along the entire periphery of the window along the inboard and outboard edges of the bead of adhesive. 5. The process of Claim 1 wherein the receptacle has a "U "-shaped cross section.
The process of Claim 1 wherein the receptacle has a "V"-shaped cross section.
