<ABSTRACT>
A data slicer for extracting auxiliary video data from a video signal adapts (212, 215) a data slicing level to the amplitude of the data signal as indicated by the average value of a run-in clock (RIC) signal that is included in the video signal. Control (200, 220, 250) of the slicing level occurs during a window interval (RICWND) that spans an integral number of cycles of the RIC signal. The presence of the RIC signal within the window interval may be verified (200, 220) as part of the slicing level adjustment operation. The data slicer is suitable for implementation in a digital integrated circuit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to detection of
information that may be present in a video signal during blanking
or overscan intervals.A video signal typically includes vertical display
intervals, or fields, having a plurality of horizontal line intervals,
e.g. 262.5 lines per field in NTSC video systems. The beginning of
each vertical and horizontal interval is identified. by respective
vertical and horizontal sync pulses that are included in a
composite video signal. During a portion of each vertical interval,
information in the video signal may not be intended for display.
For example, a vertical blanking interval spans approximately the
first 20 horizontal line intervals in each field. In addition, several
line intervals adjacent to the vertical blanking period, e.g. line 21,
may be within an overscan region of a video display and will not
be visible.The lack of displayed image information during
blanking and overscan intervals makes it possible to insert an
auxiliary information component, e.g. teletext or closed caption
data, into these intervals. Standards such as Federal
Communications Commissions (FCC) Regulations define the format
for each type of auxiliary information including the positioning of
the information within a vertical interval. For example, the
present closed captioning standard (see e.g. 47 CFR §§ 15.119 and
73.682) specifies that digital data corresponding to ASCII
characters for closed captioning must be in line 21 of field 1.The first step in extracting auxiliary video information
is to locate the auxiliary information. Various approaches may be
used depending on the type of information involved. For example, 
recognition of teletext data characteristics such as the framing
code pattern is a method of locating teletext data. Closed caption
information in line 21 may be located by counting video lines, e.g.
counting horizontal sync pulses.After the auxiliary video information is located, the
information must be extracted. In the case of digital data, a "data
slicer" may be used to convert the video signal into binary data.
A data slicer typically operates by comparing the video signal
level to a reference level known as the slicing level. For video
levels that exceed the slicing level, the comparison produces a
logic 1. Video levels that are less than the slicing level produce a
logic 0. As an example, closed caption data in line 21 of the video
signal may exhibit a signal amplitude range of 0 IRE to 50 IRE.
For a signal range of 0 IRE to 50 IRE, a slicing level of 25 IRE
would
