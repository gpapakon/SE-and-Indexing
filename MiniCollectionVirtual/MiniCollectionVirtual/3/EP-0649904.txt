<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is directed to 
diagnostic reagents for the detection of 

antibodies against the Epstein Barr Virus and a 
method for the detection of antibodies to the 

Epstein Barr Virus in a sample. 
The diagnostic reagents according to the 
invention comprise a combination of at least part 

of an Epstein Barr viral structural protein, 
preferably a Epstein Barr VCA-protein or an 

Epstein Barr MA protein, and at least part of an 
Epstein Barr EBNA protein. Preferably, the VCA-protein 

is VCA-p18 protein, the MA-protein is MA-gp350/220 
protein and the EBNA-protein is EBNA-1 

protein. 
It has been found that the combination of a 
VCA-protein or a MA-protein, and an EBNA protein, 

into a single diagnostic assay yields an EBV-antibody 
detection method with greater 

sensitivity and accuracy than current methods.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to
diagnostic reagents for the detection of
antibodies against the Epstein Barr Virus and a
method for the detection of antibodies to the
Epstein Barr Virus in a sample.EBV is an ubiquitous human herpes virus that
was first discovered in association with the
African (endemic or e) form of Burkitt's lymphoma
(BL). Subsequently the virus was also found
associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)
and was shown to be the causative agent of
infectious mononucleosis (IM). Infection usually
occurs during early childhood, generally
resulting in a subclinical manifestation,
occasionally with mild symptoms. Infection during
adolescence or adulthood, however, can give rise
to IM characterized by the presence of atypical
lymphocytes in the periphery. The bulk of these
lymphocytes are T lymphocytes; however, included
in their number are a small population of B
lymphocytes infected by EBV. The infection of B
lymphocytes may also be accomplished in vitro.
Such cells become transformed and proliferate
indefinite in culture and have been referred to
as "immortalized", "latently infected" or "growth
transformed". As far as is known, all individuals
who become infected with EBV remain latently
infected for life. This is reflected by the
lifelong continuous presence of small numbers of
EBV-genome positive transformed B-cells among the
circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes and the 
continuous but periodic shedding of virus in the
oropharynx.In the vast majority of cases EBV infection
results in a lymphoproliferative disease that may
be temporarily debilitating, but is always benign
and self-limiting. In certain immunosuppressed
individuals, however, the result can be full-blown
malignancy. This occurs in individuals who
are immuno-suppressed intentionally, particularly
children receiving organ transplants who are
treated with cyclosporine A, or
opportunistically, as in the case with
individuals infected with HIV, or genetically, as
in the case of affected males carrying the XLP
(x-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome) gene. In
these cases the resulting malignancies derive
from the polyclonal proliferation of EBV-infected
B cells. In addition, in such patients
uncontrolled epithelial replication of the virus
is detectable in lesions of oral hairy
leukoplakia. Thus, the immune response plays a
central role in the control of EBV infection.The presence of EBV in cells or tissues can
be demonstrated by detection of the viral genome
or demonstration of the EBNA-1 protein, the sole
latency
