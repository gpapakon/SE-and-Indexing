<ABSTRACT>
A system for reducing receiver power consumption in communication system having a transmitter (141) and one or more receivers (146) schedules periodic message in "slot". Each receiver is assigned a slot during which it monitors the transmission. The transmitter (141) transmits messages to the receiver only during the assigned slots. The receiver is in an "active state" during its assigned slot. During the "inactive state", which is the time period between successive occurrences of its assigned slot, the receiver may perform any action not requiring coordination with transmitter. At a time during the inactive state shortly before the assigned slot, the receiver applies power to these components and performs initialization. Such initialization may include reacquiring a pilot channel signal to which the receiver may synchronize itself if its timing signal have drifted out of synchronization with those of the transmitter during the preceding inactive state.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to mobile communications systems
such as cellular telephone systems and, more specifically, to a system for
reducing power consumption in a mobile or portable transceiver of such a
system.In many communications systems, the transceivers are only
sporadically active. For example, a cellular telephone remains idle for
significant periods of time when no call is in progress. During such idle
periods the cellular telephone consumes substantially the same amount of
power as during active periods. However, to ensure that a transceiver
receives sporadically transmitted messages, it must continuously monitor a
channel. In a digital cellular telephone system, such as that described in
U.S. Patent No. 5,056,031 entitled "Method and Apparatus for Controlling
Transmission Power in a CDMA Cellular Telephone System" and
U.S. Patent No. 5103459 entitled "System
and Method for Generating Signal Waveforms in a CDMA Cellular
Telephone System," issued on April 7, 1992 both assigned to the assignee of the present invention,
messages transmitted by a base station may include those for alerting the
mobile station to the presence of an incoming call and those for periodically
updating system parameters in the mobile station.While a mobile station installed in a vehicle may be powered by the
vehicle's electrical system, prolonged use of the mobile station when the
vehicle is not operating may drain the vehicle's battery. Furthermore,
many mobile stations are portable and powered by an internal battery.
Personal Communications Systems (PCS) handsets are almost exclusively
battery powered. In any such stations it is desirable to minimize power
consumption to increase battery life.A mobile station may consume significant amounts of power by
continuously monitoring the channel for incoming messages. The
resulting power drain on the battery reduces the time available for actively
handling calls. A system that reduces power consumption by periodically
monitoring the channel for incoming messages during idle periods would
be highly desirable. These problems and deficiencies are clearly felt in the
art and are solved by the present invention in the manner described below. Attention is drawn to the U.S. Patent 4,713,808, which discloses a watch pager
system and a communication protocol in which messages are being transmitted from
a clearinghouse via a transmitter facility to a watch pager within a local area and
wherein a power limited receiver will turn on briefly during its assigned time slot and
subframe
