<ABSTRACT>
A new yoghurt which contains live lactic ferments, 

particularly suitable for early childhood feeding is 
described, comprising a yoghurt base and a cereals meal 

mixture in soja extract, said mixture being prefermented 
with a Bifidobacterium Infantis and eventually 

Streptococcus thermophilus colture, and then, if it is 
desired, to the product thus obtained homogenized, 

aromatized and refined fruit pulp is added. A process 
for its preparation and its use in the early childhood 

feeding are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a new yoghurt added 
with a valuable cereals meal mixture, particularly oats, 
rice and wheat seed, in soja extract, said mixture 
being prefermented with Bifidobacterium Infantis 
eventually added with Streptococcus thermophilus, and a 
process for preparing the same. The new product object 
of the present invention, combining freshness, tastiness 
and texture to a strong nutritional and salutistic 
connotation and to a high live lactic ferments content, 
is particularly suitable for the early childhood 
feeding. Products for childhood feeding containing yoghurt and 
milk fermented with Bifido Infantis, and sometime with 
Lb. acidophilus, and fruit, are well known in the art. 
These are however preparations either devoid of live 
specific flora or products in which Bifido Infantis (and 
eventually Lb. acidophilus) performs its fermentative 
activity exclusively on fermented milk (YO PLASMON, 
TEDDI SCALDASOLE), so that the end-product is able to 
provide only the nutritional factors correlated to the 
milk fermentation. It was therefore an object of the present invention to 
provide a new yoghurt having nutritional values and 
total freshness characteristics which are original and 
different from those of similar product already on the 
market. The new "yoghurt" should combine moreover 
freshness, tastiness and texture to a strong nutritional 
connotation in order to make it particularly suitable 
for early childhood feeding owing to its high biologic 
value and to its good digeribility. To this end the inventors carried out several studies 
for enhancing the nutritional, digeribility and  
 
organoleptic properties of the end-product, and they 
have found that when yoghurt is mixed with a particular, 
apart prepared semifinished product, and then eventually 
with fruit, a food can be obtained having a high 
biologic value which is particularly suitable for the 
early childhood feeding. The proposed aim has been surprisingly reached by means 
of a yoghurt base added with valuable cereals meal 
mixture in soja extract, said mixture being previously 
fermented separately with Bifidobacterium Infantis 
eventually added with Streptococcus thermophilus. To the 
natural product thus obtained mashed fruit, eventually 
aromatized and suitably refined for having the creamy 
aspect and the homogeneity requested by the early 
chilhood, was then added. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to 
provide a base yoghurt added with cereals meal mixture, 
as oats, rice,

<CLAIMS>
Yoghurt containing live lactic ferments for the early 
childhood feeding, characterized in that it contains a
