<ABSTRACT>
A commutator motor which is sealed in a moisture-proof manner is known for driving a hydraulic pump which is arranged in a pump housing (35), in the case of which commutator motor the brush supporting plate (131), which is made of insulating material, for the brushes, which interact with the commutator (117), is designed as a flat sealing element between the pump housing (129) and the motor housing (103). This commutator (101) is improved according to the invention in that the pot-shaped motor housing (103) has a sealing surface (139) which is connected to the inner cylindrical envelope surface (107) as an extension, is in the form of a cone, and can be moved into contact with a conical mating sealing surface (143) which is arranged on the brush supporting plate (131), which can be pushed into the motor housing (103). This results in continuous moisture-proof assembly of the commutator motor (101).
