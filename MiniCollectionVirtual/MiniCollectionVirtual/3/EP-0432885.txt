<ABSTRACT>
A stator vane stage (54A) in a split-case, 
variable geometry axial flow compressor (30) includes 

two 180-degree spoke-like arrays of stator vanes 
(56) on upper and lower case halves (16,18) of the 

compressor case (12) and a pair of unitary, 
180-degree arc shroud ring segments (84,86). Each 

stator vane (56) has a pivot shaft (64) at one end 
rotatably supported in a radial bore (70) in the 

corresponding case half by a bushing (74), and has 
a cylindrical vane button (66) at the other end. 

Each shroud ring segment (84,86) has a corresponding 
plurality of cylindrical vane button sockets (100) in 

an outer surface (88,94) thereof, each of which 
rotatably receives a corresponding vane button (66). 

The spoke-like array of the stator vanes (56) rigidly 
positions the shroud ring segments (84,86) relative 

to the compressor case (12). To assemble the shroud 
ring segments (84,86) to the stator vanes (56), 

the shroud ring segments (84,86) are first 
resiliently squeezed radially inwards, whilst the 

vane buttons (66) are sequentially inserted into the 
corresponding vane button sockets (100), and then are 

released to spring back to their true 180-degree arc 
shapes in which they are retained on the stator vanes 

(56).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to stator vane 
stages in axial flow compressors in gas turbine 
engines as specified in the preamble of claim 1, for 
example as disclosed in GB-A-622,767. In typical axial flow compressors in gas 
turbine engines, an annular airflow channel of 
progressively decreasing area is defined between a 
compressor case and a rotor in the case. Annular 
rotor blade stages induce flow in the airflow 
channel and annular stator vane stages between the 
rotor blade stages redirect the airflow. In variable 
geometry axial flow compressors, the stator vanes are 
rotatable about spoke-like radial axes of the case. 
A hub-like shroud ring on the inner radial ends of 
the stator vanes defines an inner boundary of the 
airflow channel where it traverses the stator vane 
stage, and supports seals which minimize leakage. In 
split-case axial flow compressors of fixed or 
variable geometry, where the case is split in a 
horizontal centre-plane of the compressor for 
assembly purposes, the shroud ring is likewise split 
into a pair of 180-degree arc shroud ring segments. Many arrangements have been proposed for 
attaching shroud ring segments to stator vanes in 
split-case, axial flow compressors. In a fixed 
geometry proposal, a pair of unitary, i.e., 
one-piece, 180-degree arc shroud ring segments are 
attached to the stator vanes through hook-like 
projections on the inner ends of the vanes which 
seat in individual sockets in the unitary, shroud 
ring segments. In some prior variable geometry 
proposals, short arc-shaped shroud ring segments are  
 
assembled with corresponding groups of vanes and then 
assembled into 180-degree arc segments by end plates 
or like connecting devices. In other prior variable 
geometry proposals, 180-degree arc shroud ring 
segments are formed by bolting together two 
180-degree arc end pieces. In the latter proposals, 
inner buttons or projections of the vanes are 
rotatably sandwiched between the bolted-together end 
pieces. Whilst the bolted-together proposals do not 
require as many individual pieces as the 
multi-segment proposals, they are limited to 
relatively large compressors because the diameters of 
the shroud ring segments must be large enough to 
accommodate both the inner vane buttons and the bolts 
or other fasteners holding the end pieces together. 
A stator vane stage and method of making the same 
according to this invention features unitary, 
one-piece 180-degree arc shroud ring segments 
rotatably connected to variable geometry stator 
vanes. A

1. A method of making an annular stage 
(54A) of variable geometry stator vanes (56) on a 

case (12) of an axial flow compressor (30), in which 
said stator vanes (56) are radially supported between 

said case (12) and a central shroud ring (58) by 
means of a plurality of radial bores (70) formed in 

said case (12) in a plane perpendicular to a 
longitudinal axis (14) of said case (12), and by 

means of a plurality of sockets (100) formed in an 
outer surface (88,94) of said central shroud ring 

(58) equal in number to the number of said stator 
vanes (56) supported in said case (12), characterised 

in that said case (12) is split in a horizontal 
centre-plane thereof into a first case half (16) and 

a second case half (18) which abut one another in 
said horizontal centre-plane at respective 

longitudinal edges (20A,20B,24A,24B) thereof, each of 
said stator vanes (56) has a pivot shaft (64) at 

one end and a vane button (66) at the other end, and 
said method comprises the steps of: forming on each 

of said first and said second case halves a 
180-degree array of said radial bores (70), inserting 

each of said vane pivot shafts (64) loosely into a 
respective one of said radial bores (70), forming
