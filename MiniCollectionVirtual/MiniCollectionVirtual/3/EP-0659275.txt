<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of clinical
diagnosis. More particularly, it relates to dry chemistry
based analytical devices, processes for manufacturing
these, as well as their use.Clinical diagnosis relates, in general, to the
determination and measurement of various substances which
relate to the health or general status of an individual.
Physicians, health care workers, and the general public as
well are concerned about the presence and levels of various
substances in body fluids such as blood, urine, and so
forth. Among the substances which have been measured in
clinical analysis for a long time are glucose, cholesterol,
and various enzymes such as amylase and creatine kinase.
More recently, determinations as to pregnancy, blood
disorders ("Quick's" tests, Partial thromblastin time or
"Ptt" tests, etc.), and infections have also become routine
in clinical diagnosis. Of most pressing concern to the
field, e.g., is the determination of antibodies to human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as a marker for Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome ("AIDS") or Aids Related Complex
("ARC"). The new tests for this virus, however, build on
a broad and deep base of earlier advances in the field.An oversimplification which nonetheless serves to
place the subject invention in proper context is division
of the field into "wet chemistry" and "dry chemistry". The
former pertains to methodologies where a reaction takes
place completely in a liquid state. Exemplary of such
chemistries is U.S. Patent No. 4,818,692, which describes
an alpha amylase assay. Review of this reference shows
that a reagent is added to a liquid sample, and, if the
analyte of interest (amylase) is present, the reagent 
reacts with it, yielding a color. The development and
intensity of the color are monitored as a determination of
the presence and amount of the analyte ("Analyte" as used
hereafter, in any context, refers to a substance to be
determined). "Dry chemistry", in contrast, involves the
placement of some or all of the reagents which are involved
in determination of an analyte under consideration onto a
solid material, such as a paper strip. The sample is
brought into contact with the solid material, and some or
all of the reactions which are necessary for the detection
of the analyte in question take place insitu. If
additional reactions involving reagents not found on the
solid material are required, these can be added after the
preliminary reactions take place. The invention concerns
dry chemistry, and therefor wet chemistry is not

Analytical device useful in determining an analyte in a
sample, comprising an absorptive material having a plurality of

zones, wherein:

i) a first zone of said absorptive material contains an
immobilized reactant which does not bind to the analyte
(ii) a second zone of said absorptive material contains an
immobilized reactant which specifically binds to the analyte to

be determined, and
(iii) a third zone of said absorptive material contains both
(a) an immobilized reactant which specifically binds to analyte

and (b) solubilizible analyte, so that a detectable reaction
product can be formed irrespective of whether the analyte is

present in the sample, indicating thereby the correct function
of the device.
