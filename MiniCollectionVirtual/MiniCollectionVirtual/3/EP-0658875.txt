<ABSTRACT>
A speech decoder capable of auditorially 
reducing the quantization noise superimposed on the 

synthesized signal and improving a speech quality at 
lower bit rates is disclosed. A de-multiplexer unit 

(100) receives and separates an index concerning 
spectrum parameter, an index concerning amplitude, 

an index concerning pitch and an index concerning 
excitation signal. A synthesis filter unit (140) 

restores a synthesis filter drive signal based on 
the index concerning pitch, the index concerning 

excitation signal and the index concerning 
amplitude, forming the synthesis filter based on the 

index concerning spectrum parameter and obtaining a 
synthesized signal by driving the synthesis filter 

with the synthesis filter drive signal. A 
postfilter unit (200) receives the output signal of 

the synthesis filter and controls the spectrum of 
the synthesized signal. A filter coefficient 

calculation unit (210) derives an auditory masking 
threshold value from the synthesized signal and 

derives postfilter coefficients corresponding to the 
masking threshold value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to speech
decoders for synthesizing speech by using indexes
received from the encoding side and, more
particularly, to a speech decoder which has a
postfilter for improving a speech quality through
control of quantization noise superimposed on
synthesized signal.As a system for encoding and transmitting a
speech signal satisfactorily to certain extent at
low bit rates, a CELP (Code-Excited Linear
Prediction) system is well known in the art. For
the details of this system, it is possible to refer
to, for instance, M. Schroeder and B. Atal
"Code-excited linear prediction: High quality speech
at very low bit rates", Proc. ICASSP, pp. 937-940,
1985 (referred to here as Literature 1) and also to
W. Kleijin et al "Improved speech quality and
efficient vector quantization in SELP", Proc.
ICASSP, pp. 155-158, 1988 (referred to here as
Literature 2).Fig. 1 shows a block diagram in the decoding
side of the CELP method. Referring to Fig. 1, a
de-multiplexer 100 receives an index concerning
spectrum parameter, an index concerning amplitude,
an index concerning pitch and an index concerning
excitation signal from the transmitting side and 
separates these indexes. An adaptive codebook unit
110 receives the index concerning pitch and
calculates an adaptive codevector z(n) based on
formula (1).
z(n) = β·v(n-d)
Here, d is calculated from the index concerning
pitch, and β is calculated from the index concerning
amplitude. An excitation codebook unit 120 reads
out corresponding codevector Sj (n) from a codebook
125 by using the index concerning excitation, and
derives and outputs excitation codevector based on
formula (2).
r(n) = γ·sj(n)
Here, γ is a gain concerning excitation signal, as
derived from the index concerning amplitude. An
adder 130 then adds together z(n) in formula (1) and
r(n) in formula (2), and derives a drive signal v(n)
based on formula (3).
v(n) = z(n) + r(n)
A synthesis filter unit 140 forms a synthesis filter
by using the index concerning spectrum parameter,
and uses the drive signal for driving to derive a
synthesized signal x(n) based on formula (4).

Here, α'i (i = 1, ..., M, M being the degree) is a
linear prediction coefficient which has been
restored from the spectrum parameter index in a
spectrum parameter restoration unit 145. A 
postfilter 150 has a role of improving the speech
quality through the control of the quantization
complex noise that is superimposed on the
synthesized signal x(n). A typical transfer
function H(z) of the postfilter is expressed by
formu
