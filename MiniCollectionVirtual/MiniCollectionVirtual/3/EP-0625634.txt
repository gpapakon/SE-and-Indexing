<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for servicing fuel injectors (11,12) comprises a 
mounting element (2) defining a chamber (6) and having a number of 

pairs of apertures (7,8) passing through the chamber (6), the mounting 
element (2) having a chamber inlet (9) leading to the chamber (6), and 

a number of adapter elements (16,17) adapted to fit within the 
apertures (7,8) and each defining a receptacle for receiving the fuel 

inlet (13) of a fuel injector (11,12), and each having an adapter inlet 
(22) for passing liquid from the chamber (6) to the receptacle from 

which the liquid then passes to the fuel inlet (13) of the injector 
(11,12). A clamping plate (42) holds a number of containers (40), 

beneath the mounting element (2), for collecting liquid which has 
passed through the injectors (11,12). The apparatus also allows the 

servicing of "top feed" injectors (61), which can be held in an upright 
position between the clamping plate (42) and the mounting element (2), 

with inlets (62) held within receiving elements (65) which supply 
liquid to the injectors (61).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an apparatus for servicing fuel 
injectors, and particularly, though not exclusively, for servicing 
electrically operated side feed fuel injectors. It is well known in the automotive industry that electrically 
operated fuel injectors are being used more and more frequently to feed 
fuel to engines. Such fuel injectors were first manufactured as "top 
feed" injectors, where the fuel was fed to the injector from its top, 
was sprayed from the bottom, and control signal lines were connected to 
one side. More recently, however, "side feed" injectors have been 
introduced where the fuel is fed into the injector through an annular 
filter in its side, is sprayed from the bottom, and the control signal 
lines are connected to the top. Such side feed injectors are available as single point injectors, 
known as Throttle Body Injectors (TBI), or, more commonly, multi point 
injectors. The advantage of the side feed injectors over the top feed 
injectors is that the fuel enters the injector over a far greater area 
than with the top feed injectors so that better filtering is achieved 
and the fuel can be sprayed out faster and under greater pressure. 
Furthermore, since there is a greater volume of the injector within the 
fuel, it is kept cooler by the fuel than the top feed injectors. Although devices to service, that is to test and clean, top feed 
injectors are known, for example from US Patent No. 4,845,979, such 
devices are not suitable for servicing side feed injectors. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide 
apparatus for servicing fuel injectors which allows side feed injectors 
to be serviced. Accordingly, the invention provides apparatus for servicing one 
or more fuel injectors each having a fuel inlet, a spray outlet, and 
electrically operable valve means operable to permit liquid to flow 
from the fuel inlet to the spray outlet, the apparatus comprising:
 
   a first mounting element comprising first and second 
substantially spaced apart face portions forming parts of a chamber, 
the first and second face portions defining at least one pair of 
apertures, the or each pair of apertures comprising a first aperture 
formed in the first face portion and a second aperture formed in the  
 
second face portion and the first and second apertures lying opposite 
each other, and the first mounting element defining a chamber inlet 
leading to the chamber; and
 
   at least one generally cylindrical adapter element having an 
interior defining a receptacle
