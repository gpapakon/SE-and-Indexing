<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exposure 
method and an exposure apparatus for implementing the 
same which are suitably applied to a scanning exposure 
apparatus for exposing a pattern on a mask onto a 
photosensitive substrate by synchronously scanning the 
mask and the photosensitive substrate to an 
illumination area of rectangular or arcuate shape. When a semiconductor device, a liquid crystal 
display device or a thin film magnetic head is to be 
manufactured by using a photo-lithography technology, a 
projection exposure apparatus which exposes a pattern 
of a photo-mask or a reticle (hereinafter collectively 
referred to as a reticle) onto a photosensitive 
substrate such as a wafer or a glass plate on which 
photo-resist is applied through a projection optical 
system has been used. Recently, as the size of a 
single chip pattern of the semiconductor device tends 
to increase, it is required to increase the exposure 
area on the photosensitive substrate so that a larger 
pattern of the reticle may be exposed. In order to comply with the requirement of the 
increased area, a scanning projection exposure  
 
apparatus for exposing a pattern on a reticle onto a 
photosensitive substrate by synchronously scanning the 
reticle and the photosensitive substrate to an 
illumination area of rectangular, arcuate or hexagonal 
shape (hereinafter collectively referred to as a slit 
illumination area) has been developed (USP 4,747,678, 
USP 4,924,257). In the past, as shown in USP 
5,194,893, in order to define a slit illumination area 
on the reticle, a movable light shielding means (view 
field diaphragm) for determining the slit illumination 
area is arranged at a position which is conjugate with 
the reticle or in the vicinity of the reticle. The 
shape of the slit illumination area on the reticle and 
the shape of the slit illumination area on the 
photosensitive substrate are controlled by a design 
constant or an apparatus constant. In such a prior art apparatus, the following two 
major problems were encountered. In general, an illumination optical system of the 
projection exposure apparatus is designed to illuminate 
the reticle with a uniform illumination light (exposure 
light). Accordingly, in the scanning projection 
exposure apparatus, in order to assure that the 
uniformity in the illumination is attained on the 
photosensitive substrate at the time when the exposure 
is completed after the scanning of the reticle and the 
photosensitive substrate relative to the slit  
 
illumination
