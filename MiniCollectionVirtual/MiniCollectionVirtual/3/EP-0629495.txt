<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a modular hydraulic 
press for producing ceramic items. Known hydraulic presses for pressing ceramic items 
starting from partially dry powder are schematically shown 
in figures 1, 2 and 3 and comprise (see figure 1) a closed 
metal structure (1) which is generally shaped like a 
quadrangular frame and inside which there is the pressing 
module (2) which is suitable to produce the necessary 
thrust between the parts of the pressing fixture (mold). 
The pressing fixture is generally constituted by two or 
more parts, of which at least one is movable (3) and the 
others are fixed (4). The pressing module (2) meant to 
generate the necessary thrust is generally of the hydraulic 
type. With a press of this type, the cycle for pressing a 
ceramic item comprises the following steps: 
-- loading: the pressing fixture is filled with an 
appropriate amount of ceramic powder; -- pressing: the ceramic powder is compacted by means of 
rigid plungers (mechanical pressing) or elastic ones 
(isostatic pressing) until the required degree of 
compaction is achieved; -- extraction: the ceramic part thus formed is removed from 
the pressing fixture to allow the fixture to be rapidly 
restored for a subsequent cycle. In a large number of industrial processes, in order to 
ensure appropriate productivity of the entire system, it is 
necessary to pool several machines to press items that have 
the same characteristics or different ones. This fact  
 
requires a considerable capital investment, since pressing 
machines are generally characterized initially by high 
purchase costs and subsequently by equally high operating 
costs. In an attempt to increase the productivity of the 
individual machine with a limited additional investment, in 
some applications which are typical of the ceramics 
industry (e.g. flooring and wall tiles, crockery, etc.) 
more than one pressing fixture is introduced in a single 
press, as shown in figure 3. In this arrangement, the 
moving parts (3), i.e. the plungers of the molds, are fixed 
to a movable beam (5) which is rigidly connected to the 
same pressing module (2) of figure 1. A severe limitation of the solution shown in figure 3 
is the fact that the items to be obtained must be 
identical, or in any case the technological pressing cycle 
must be exactly the same, as it is impossible to mount 
various different fixtures in a single pressing module. 
This happens in flooring and wall ceramics, where the 
movable beam of the press carries a plurality of
