<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of certain acylated
citrate esters as peracid precursors in a bleaching or a
disinfecting operation.Bleaching operations using hydrogen peroxide or compounds
capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide, hereinafter referred to
as peroxygen bleaches, have been extensively described in the
art. Such peroxygen bleaches have an advantage over chlorine
bleaches , in that they are milder bleaches. This advantage is
especially significant in the context of a fabric laundering
operation because peroxygen bleaches are safer to fabric colors
and are non-yellowing to white fabrics. A major drawback of peroxygen bleaches is that they are less active than chlorine
bleaches at low temperatures which are often encountered in modern laundering
operations, or in the treatment of hard surfaces. Thus, peroxygen bleach activators
have been developed, which have been extensively addressed in the art. These
activators can be transition metal or peracid precursors. Peracid precursors react
with hydrogen peroxide to yield peracids. Peracids are the "activated" bleaching
species which are efficient at low temperatures.Such peracid-yielding systems are also of interest in non-laundry applications, as
they provide disinfectancy benefits in addition to some bleaching benefits, due to the
peracid. Such benefits are particularly desirable on kitchen and bathroom surfaces,
especially in toilet bowls.Peroxygen type bleaches are also advantageous over chlorine bleaches in terms of
environmental compatibility, and there is a continuous need for the development of
products which are ever more environmentally compatible. Specifically, there is a
need to develop environmentally compatible peracid precursors.In addition, products comprising both a peroxygen bleach and an activator need to
meet a balance between shelf-stability of that combination, and its capability to react
as fast as possible in water, during the bleaching operation. These two
characteristics are somewhat contradictory. This problem is especially acute in
liquid aqueous compositions, but it also exists in dry products where shelf stability
can become an issue if the product is subjected to humid environments, as the
product can become damp and may loose some activity.US 3,025,271 discloses acylated citrate esters used as plasticizers and flexibilizers.
During the synthesis of the acylated citrate esters hydrogen peroxide is used and
therefore a mixture of acylated citrate esters and hydrogen peroxide is disclosed. However, no specific
