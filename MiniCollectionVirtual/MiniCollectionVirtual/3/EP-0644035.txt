<ABSTRACT>
A coextruded multilayer plastic container utilizing 
post consumer plastic resin comprising an appearance enhancing 

thin outer layer of ethylene polymers, which enhances the 
appearance of the container, an intermediate layer comprising 

a fusion blend of post consumer resin with or without colorant 
and a third layer comprising a fusion blend of post consumer 

resin which may have mixed colors. In a modified and preferred 
form, a fourth inner layer of virgin ethylene polymer is provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a multilayer coextruded
plastic container and to a method of forming same.In the use of plastic materials for containers such
as bottles, it has been found desirable to attempt to
recycle and reuse the plastic which is commonly known as
post consumer plastic (PCP) or post consumer resin (PCR).
In attempts to make containers from such materials, it has
been found that the properties have been adversely affected.Specifically when containers are made from
recycled post consumer high density polyethylene
homopolymers (HDPE) container scrap, it has been found that
the containers have diminished physical properties. Such
containers made of high density polyethylene homopolymers
also have been used for packaging of certain types of liquid
detergent products. The use of such containers to package
liquid detergent products has been somewhat restricted,
however, by reason of the fact that many types of liquid
detergent products accelerate the tendency of the container
to exhibit stress cracking. Stress cracking is evidenced by
the appearance of hazy cracks in the container which are
aesthetically unpleasing to the ultimate consumer. In
extreme cases, stress cracking can lead to leakage of the
contents from the container. Stress cracking can occur when
the containers are for liquid products including liquid
detergents and liquid hypochlorite bleaches.It has been suggested that such post consumer resin
be utilized because large quantities of high density
polyethylene post consumer resin are available due to the
extensive use of high density polyethylene in large
containers for milk and water. Post consumer resin from such
containers contains contaminants of paper and other plastic
resins, for example, from closures such that it has been
generally thought that it can not be used to make 
satisfactory plastic containers.A container with the features of the preamble to
claim 1 is known from Plastic Engineering, Vol. 49, No. 9,
March 1992, Brookfield, CT, USA, that discloses coextruded
bottles having a three-layer sandwich of a scrap core layer
between exterior and interior virgin-only layers. Dark crap
can be masked by an interposed, additional pigmented white
virgin layer between the exterior surface layer and the
scrap-containing layer.In EP-A-0 561 187 which is prior art under Art. 54(3)
EPC, there is disclosed a plastic container made from a
fusion blend of a post consumer plastic and ethylene
polymers and comprising post consumer resin of homopolymer
high density polyethylene resin and a

<CLAIMS>
A multilayer coextruded plastic container having walls
comprising


a thin outer plastic layer (A, A') including virgin
ethylene polymer,
a relatively thick inner layer (C, C') including post
consumer resin which layer contributes the major portion

of the container wall; and
a thin intermediate opaque plastic layer (B, B') masking
said post consumer resin of said relatively thick inner

layer (C, C'),

characterized in that
said thin outer plastic layer (A, A') is a fusion blend
of said virgin ethylene polymer and an appearance

enhancing additive and
said thin intermediate opaque plastic layer (B, B')
comprises a fusion blend of post consumer resin

including colorants.
The container of claim 1 wherein said layers (A, B, C)
are bonded to one another by heat during coextrusion.
The container set forth in claim 2 including a fourth
layer (D) of virgin polymer resin over the inner layer

(C, C') and forming the inner surface of the container.
The container set forth in claim 1 or 2 including a
further inner layer (D') made of solvent resistant

plastic resin which forms the inner surface of the
container.
The container set forth in claim 4 wherein said solvent
resistant plastic resin comprises nylon including an

adhesive layer between the intermediate opaque layer
(B') and the inner layer (C') of post consumer resin and 

an adhesive layer between the inner layer (C') of post
consumer resin and said further inner layer (D') of

solvent resistant plastic, each said adhesive layer
comprising a nylon/polyethylene adhesive.
The container set forth in any one of claims 1 to 4
wherein the appearance enhancing additive is selected

from the group comprising pigments, pearlescent
additives, fluorescent additives and glossy molecular

weight resins.
The container of any of claims 1 to 6 wherein said
appearance enhancing additive in said thin outer plastic

layer (A, A') contains a glossy high density
polyethylene.
The container of any of claims 1 to 7 wherein said
intermediate layer (B) comprises post consumer resin

from milk containers, and a colouring pigment.
The container of any of claims 1 to 8 wherein said
relatively thick inner layer (C) also includes regrind

besides of said post consumer resin.
The container set forth in any of claims 7 to 9
including a fourth layer (D) over said inner layer (C)

comprising a fusion blend of virgin high density
polyethylene and colorant, said further inner layer (D)

forming the inner surface of the container. 
A method of forming a multilayer coextruded plastic
container comprising the steps of


providing a multilayer parison which has a thin outer
layer (A, A') including virgin ethylene polymer,

a relative thin intermediate opaque layer (B, B') and
a relative thick inner layer (C, C') of post consumer

resin,
blow molding the parison to form a container, wherein
the inner layer (C, C') of post consumer resin comprises

the major portion of the container and said opaque layer
(B, B') maskes the post consumer resin,

characterized by
providing a thin outer layer (A, A') which is a fusion blend of
virgin ethylene polymer and an appearance enhancing

additive, and
providing a thin intermediate opaque plastic layer (B, B') which
comprises a fusion blend of post consumer resin

including colorants.

fourth layer (D) of virgin polymer resin over the inner

layer (C, C') so as to prepare forming of the inner
surface of the container.
The method set forth in claim 11 including a further
inner layer (D') made of solvent resistant plastic resin

which forms the inner surface of the container.
The method set forth in claim 13 wherein said solvent
resistant plastic resin comprises nylon including an

adhesive layer between the intermediate opaque layer
(B') and the inner layer (C') of post consumer resin and
