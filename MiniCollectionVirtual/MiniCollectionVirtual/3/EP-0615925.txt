<ABSTRACT>
Article loading apparatus and method for loading articles 
such as fiberboard containers onto a loading carrier base (14) such 

as pallet, with which it is possible to reduce required labor 
and to enhance working efficiency. An article loading 

conveyer (13) which makes a conveying path on which an article is 
conveyed swingable and extendable is provided. An article 

transfer carrier having an article sliding surface is 
connected to a distal end of the loading conveyor (13). The 

article sliding surface is kept at a substantially constant

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an article loading
process for loading articles in a plurality of loading sections
defined on a loading carrier and to an article loading
apparatus.It is known in the art that a telescopic conveyor is used
in order to load articles such as fiberboard containers onto a
loading carrier base such as a pallet, a container carrier and
a motor truck loading space, as disclosed in Japanese Utility
Model Publication No. Sho. 48-110885. The telescopic conveyor
is provided with a conveyance path which enables the conveyance
of the articles thereon toward a side where the articles are to
be loaded and which is designed to be swingable and telescopic
(extendible and contractible). With such a conveyor, a worker
can receive, at the distal end of the conveyor, each of the
articles which are conveyed toward the loading side, and load
the received article onto a required loading position of the
side.The conventional art as mentioned above, however has the
following deficiencies:
(1) Since the telescopic conveyor is swung depending on
the level or height of the loading position, the conveyance
path of the conveyor is made inclined upward or downward in
use. Consequently, the worker must stop and receive, at the 
distal end of the conveyor, the article to which the conveying
force due to the incline of the conveyor is applied.
Thereafter, the worker must orient or direct the article
suitably for loading and further transfer the article to the
loading position by himself (without any external assist).
Thus, the worker must repeat heavy physical labor and be forced
to perform hard work.(2) If an article conveying-in conveyor is connected to
the upstream end of the telescopic conveyor so as to
successively convey the articles thereto without any temporal
stoppage or storage of the articles, the worker will never view
all the articles to be loaded entirely before starting the
loading operation. Thus, it is impossible for the worker to
perform the loading operation after the determination is
preliminary made as to how the loading process is carried out
(the articles should be loaded vertically or horizontally, or
the like) in order to form a completed posture of the articles,
which is hardly collapsed onto the load carrier base.
Therefore, the working efficiency cannot be sufficiently
improved.(3) In the case where a single article conveying-in
conveyor is connected to the upstream end of the telescopic
conveyor, the downstream end of the telescopic conveyor is
generally set at a fixed
