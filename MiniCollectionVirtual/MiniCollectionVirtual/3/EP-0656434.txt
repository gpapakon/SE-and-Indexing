<ABSTRACT>
The pressure roller possesses a roller core (1) and a covering (3) attached to the roller core (1) and consisting of elastomeric material. It is characterised by an addition of finely distributed electrically conductive material, for example metal powder, at least in the region of the circumferential surface of the covering (3). The electrically conductive material can be contained in a coating (4) arranged on the circumferential surface of the covering (3). The pressure roller is intended for cooperation with a drivable counter-roller (5) for the movement of fibre material. The addition of electrically conductive material counteracts electrostatic charges, primarily when the charges may be derived, and thus reduces the risk that fibres from the fibre material to be moved are wound on to the pressure roller during operation.

A pressure roller for a spinning preparation
machine, for cooperating with a counter roller for

the movement of fibre material, with a roller core
(1) and a cover (3) which is applied on the roller

core and is made from rubber-elastic material,
with an addition of distributed, electrically

conductive material at least in the zone of the
circumferential surface of the cover (3), with the

circumferential surface of the cover (3) carrying
a coating (4) which contains the finely distributed

electrically conductive material.
A pressure roller as claimed in claim 1, characterized
in that the electrically conductive

material is a metal powder and/or graphite powder.
A pressure roller as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the coating (4) is in

contact with an electrically conductive element
(6; 7).
A pressure roller as claimed in claim 3, characterized

in that the electrically conductive element
(6; 7) rests on the circumference of the

coating (4).
A pressure roller as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the coating (4) is electrically

conductively connected with bearing journals
(2) which are carried by the roller core (1) and

consist at least partly of metal.
A pressure roller as claimed in one of the claims
1 to 5, characterized in that the coating (4) consists

of a mixture of polytetrafluor ethylene 
artificial resin with the electrically conductive

material.
A pressure roller as claimed in one of the claims
1 to 6, characterized in that chalk meal is mixed

into the coating (4).
