<ABSTRACT>
A fluid flow cartridge (16) for seating in an opening (14) into a microwave 
heating cavity (12) comprises a tubing support having an electrically conductive 

surface dimensioned to substantially close that opening and an elongated bobbin 
portion (36) projecting from that surface. The cartridge also includes a selected length 

of tubing (62) wound around the bobbin portion to form a coil, opposite end segments 
of the tubing extending from the coil through the conductive support surface (35) and 

away from said support. Preferably, the coil has straight tubing segments (63a) on 
opposite sides of the coil spaced apart one quarter wavelength or integral multiple 

thereof at the operating frequency of the heating cavity.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to in-line microwave warming apparatus
for blood and other fluids. It relates more particularly to a
disposable cartridge for containing the fluid being warmed by
such apparatus.In many applications, particularly in the medical field, there
is a requirement that a circulated fluid be warmed. For
example, in connection with cardiac surgery during
extracoporial circulation (ECC), the patient is first cooled in
order to slow metabolism and thereafter the circulating blood
is warmed to return it to body temperature. As another
example, heated intravenous fluids are useful in hyperthermic
patients and in trauma patients requiring massive IV
resuscitation.One old technique for warming blood is to pass the blood
through tubing coils immersed in a warm water bath. However,
this warming method is relatively slow and the warming
apparatus quite cumbersome.Also, microwave heating has been used in connection with the
heating of blood and intravenous fluids. Typically, a
microwave oven is used to warm the fluid in bulk, e.g., blood
in a blood bag. However, it has been found to be extremely
difficult to achieve uniform heating of the blood due to non-uniform
distribution of microwave energy within the oven and
the inability, using microwaves, to heat at sufficient depths 
in a lossy material such as blood which has a high dielectric
constant.Recently, there has been developed an in-line warming apparatus
which can warm blood or other fluid flowing through a conduit
situated in a heating cavity using microwave energy delivered
to that cavity. This apparatus, described in my U.S. patent
5,073,167, comprises a waveguide heating cavity having a source
of microwave energy coupled thereto. A support element forms,
with a fixed length of tubing wound about the element, a
disposable cartridge which may be positioned in the heating
region of the heating cavity. The characteristics, and
placement within the heating cavity, of the cartridge are such
that rapid, efficient, uniform heating of the fluid results.
Preferably, the apparatus also includes a non-invasive
temperature monitor coupled to the heating cavity for
monitoring the temperature of the fluid flowing through the
tube non-invasively. Also, controls, including a desired
operating temperature selector, are provided for combining
signals representative of not only cavity temperature, but also
inlet and outlet temperatures to control closely the power
level of the microwave energy delivered to the fluid in the
heating cavity.In that in-line
