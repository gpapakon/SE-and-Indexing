<ABSTRACT>
Integrated optical switching device for switchably converted a fraction of a first guided mode signal into a second guided mode signal of different order. Added to a passive mode converter (c) provided with a bimodal waveguide, in which said conversion can take place by means of a periodic coupling in coupling surfaces 1-N as a consequence of a specific geometry (f, g), are means (10, 14) for switchably disrupting the coupling, as a consequence of which the conversion does or does not take place. Preferably, the device is constructed on semiconductor material and the modification is carried out by charge carrier injection. On/off and directional switches based on this are described. Advantages: very good integrability, short length, no critical parameters in the manufacture, and operation at low control currents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is in the field of integrated optical devices. More particularly
it relates to an optical switching device for switching a light signal.In a coherent optical local network, a subscriber is connected by means of a
combined coherent optical transmitter/receiver. Such a combined transmitter/
receiver is preferably constructed as an integrated device. In such a
transmitter/receiver, a switch should be incorporated for closing the
transmission channel in order to be able to adjust the transmitter without
disrupting the network.For such a switch, an isolation or extinction ratio is required of at least
approximately 40 dB. Various types of switches, 1 × 2 or 2 × 2, are known,
such as the directional coupler, the digital optical switch, or a Mach-Zehnder
switch. These known switches generally have an isolation of 20 to 30 dB and
do not therefore achieve the required isolation. It is true that the required
isolation can be achieved by placing two or more such switches in series. This
means, however, that the complexity and the integration space needed
increases. Another switching possibility, which directly fits in with the use of
semiconductor material, can be obtained by means of charge carrier injection.
As a result of injecting free charge carriers into the semiconductor material
over a certain length of a waveguide via an electrode, the absorption increases.
In principle, any desired isolation could be obtained simply by making said
length and/or the current of charge carriers large enough. An absorption
switch of this type would, in addition, be very simple since it can be formed 
by a waveguide and an electrode placed lengthwise thereon. With the present
state of the art of making contact, however, semiconductor materials, such as
InP, do not withstand current densities greater than 20 kA/cm2, which is
equivalent to a length of not less than 1 cm for the desired 40 dB isolation. In
view of the fact that the typical dimensions of a 'chip' of semiconductor
material are at present between 1 and 2 cm, this is long.Reference [1] discloses a directional coupler on semiconductor material,
which directional coupler makes use, for the control thereof, of charge carrier
injection over the length of the coupling section with the aid of an electrode
placed centrally above the central coupling section. In this switch, too, the
isolation or extension ratio is of the order of 20 dB.In a bimodal waveguide, light signals can generally propagate, within a
particular wavelength range, both in a zeroth-order
