<ABSTRACT>
A pearling machine has an abrasive type pearling roll 
assembly (29) which is formed by stacking a plurality of 

pearling rolls (29a) via intervening air blowing spacers. 
Stirring bars (40) are secured to the outer periphery of 

the individual pearling rolls (29a). Resistance bars (23) 
are provided on the inner surface of a vertical polygonal 

bran removal cylinder (20). With a cooperative function of 
the stirring and resistance bars (40,23), grains supplied 

to a pearling chamber (56) defined by the pearling roll 
assembly (29) and the bran removal cylinder (20) receive 

active spinning and revolution action. The grains thus 
receive uniform cutting action, and thus they are pearled 

uniformly. The vertical pearling machine permits optimum 
pearling of grains in dependence on the kind and character 

of the grains and is suited particularly to the pearling of 
tempered wheat with outer layer part having been made tough 

and inner layer part having been made soft.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vertical pearling machine
for pearling wheat or like grains and also to an apparatus
for preliminary treatment for flour milling using a plurality
of such vertical pearling machines connected in tandem.In a broadly practiced method of producing wheat
flour, the raw wheat which has been cleaned and conditioned
is directly broken without its bran part being removed, and
its endosperm part (about 84% by weight) which is to be
eventual product flour is separated from its bran part
(13.5% by weight) and its germ part (2.5% by weight), these
bran and germ parts being undesired as contents in the
product flour. The introduction of the bran part which
contains much ash deteriorates the quality of the product
flour, and therefore the content of this part should be
made as little as possible. To this end, prior to the
flour milling, the raw material is conditioned with water
or steam and then tempered in a tempering bin for 4 to 20 
hours for making each wheat grain bran layer tough and the
endosperm soft.By carrying out these preliminary treatments prior to
the flour milling process, the flour milling characteristics
are generally improved. Depending on the tempering
time, however, the coupling between the endosperm and the
inner bran layer is rather strengthened to make the separation
of the endosperm and bran parts difficult. In view of
this problem, a technique of removing the bran, which is
undesired to be contained in the product flour, prior to
the flour milling, has been proposed as disclosed in, for
instance, Japanese Patent Application Kokai Publication No.
Hei 2-184347. This prior art will now be described with
reference to the flow chart of Fig. 1.As shown in the Figure, the cleaned raw wheat A is
first fed to a water additioner 101 for adding a slight
amount of water to soften its bran. Then, it is immediately
pearled in a pearling process 106, which is constituted
by a tandem connection of friction units (i.e., friction
type pearling machines) 102 and 103 and abrasive units
(i.e., abrasive type pearling machines) 104 and 105. While
the material is pearled, further water is added to moisten
the material surface. The pearled wheat B thus obtained is
fed through a wiper 107 and a cooler 108 to a further water
additioner 109 for further water addition to obtain conditioned 
tioned pearled wheat C containing about 16% of water by
weight.In the above prior art, however, since water is added
to the pearled wheat obtained -after the pearling process
106, the starch layer of the
