<ABSTRACT>
A device integrated on a chip of a 
semiconductor material is disclosed which comprises an 

NPN bipolar transistor (T2) and an N-channel MOSFET 
transistor (T3) in an emitter switching configuration, 

both being vertical conduction types. The bipolar 
transistor (T2) has its base (13) and emitter (14) 

regions buried; the MOSFET transistor (T3) is formed 
with an N region (16) bounded by the base (13) and the 

emitter (14) regions and isolated by a deep base 
contact and isolation region (15). To improve the 

device performance, especially at large currents, an N+ 
region (17) is provided which extends from the front of 

the chip inwards of the isolated region (16) and around 
the MOSFET transistor (T3). 
In one embodiment of the invention, a MOSFET 
drive transistor (T1) is integrated which has its drain 

terminal in common with the collector (C) of the 
bipolar transistor (T2), its source terminal connected 

to the base of the bipolar transistor (T2), and its 
gate electrode connected to the gate electrode (G) of 

the MOSFET transistor (T3) in the emitter switching 
configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to monolithic
integrated semiconductor structures, in particular a
device as defined in the preamble of claim 1.As is known, an emitter switching
configuration is composed of a vertical bipolar
transistor, usually a high-voltage power transistor,
and an electronic switch in series with the emitter of
the bipolar transistor. Expediently, the electronic
switch is a low-voltage MOSFET power transistor
connected with its drain terminal to the emitter
terminal of the bipolar transistor. The electronic
switch "break" causes the bipolar transistor to be cut
off in an extremely fast manner, thereby such a
configuration is used to advantage in those
applications where the bipolar transistor is to be to
switched between its conductive and non-conductive
states at a fast rate.An integrated structure of a device including
a bipolar power transistor and a MOSFET transistor in
the above configuration is described in European Patent
Application EP 88202899.6 filed on 16.12.88 by 
SGS-THOMSON MICROELECTRONICS and published as EP-A- 322041. Briefly, that structure,
also shown in Figure 1 of the drawings which accompany
this specification, is formed on a substrate 10 of a
semiconductor material, e.g. a chip of monocrystalline
silicon, of the N+ type, that is having a high
concentration of impurities of the N type. (Notice
that, in the drawing, the concentrations of impurities
of the N type and the P type are identified as
customary by the addition of a sign "-" or "+" to the
characters N and P; the characters N and P, when added
no "-" or "+" sign denoting concentrations of
intermediate value.)Formed on the substrate 10 are two epitaxial
layers 11 and 12 of the N- and N types, respectively.
The layer 11 and the substrate 10, together contain the
collector region of the bipolar transistor. A metallic
layer 28, applied on the free surface of the substrate,
forms the collector terminal C.A P- region, designated 13, formed between
the epitaxial layers 11 and 12, and accordingly
commonly referred to as a buried region, forms the base
region of the transistor. A P+ isolation and deep base
contact region 15 extends from the front surface of the
chip, that is, the opposite surface from the collector
terminal C to the edge of the base region 13, and 
encloses an isolated N region designated 16. A second
buried region 14, of the N type with a high
concentration of impurities and provided on the
P- region 13 to form a junction therewith, constitutes the
emitter region of the transistor.A P region 25 extends
