<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a lithographic printing plate 
comprising on a first side of a flexible support a surface 

differentiated in oleophilic and oleophobic areas and on a second 
side opposite to said first side a layer comprising micro-particles 

of pressure-sensitive adhesive. The present invention also provides 
a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising on a first side 

of a flexible support a surface capable of being differentiated in 
oleophilic and oleophobic areas upon imaging and on a second side 

opposite to said first side a layer comprising micro-particles of 
pressure-sensitive adhesive covered with a protective stripping 

layer. The obtained printing plates practically show no stretching 
when mounted on a printing press under tension nor is there any 

stretching during the printing process itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for making a
lithographic printing plate, in particular to a method wherein a
lithographic printing plate precursor having a flexible support,
e.g. a polyester film support is used.Lithographic printing is the process of printing from specially
prepared surfaces, some areas of which are capable of accepting ink
(oleophilic areas) whereas other areas will not accept ink
(oleophobic areas). The oleophilic areas form the printing areas
while the oleophobic areas form the background areas.Two basic types of lithographic printing plates are known.
According to a first type, so called wet printing plates, both water
or an aqueous dampening liquid and ink are applied to the plate
surface that contains hydrophilic and hydrophobic areas. The
hydrophilic areas will be soaked with water or the dampening liquid
and are thereby rendered oleophobic while the hydrophobic areas will
accept the ink. A second type of lithographic printing plates
operates without the use of a dampening liquid and are called
driographic printing plates. This type of printing plates comprise
highly ink repellant areas and oleophilic areas. Generally the
highly ink repellant areas are formed by a silicon layer.Lithographic printing plates can be prepared using a
photosensitive lithographic printing plate precursor, also called
imaging element. Such imaging element is exposed in accordance with
the image data and is generally developed thereafter so that a
differentiation results in ink accepting properties between the
exposed and unexposed areas.Examples of photosensitive lithographic printing plate
precursors are for example the silver salt diffusion transfer
(hereinafter DTR) materials disclosed in EP-A-410500, EP-A-483415,
EP-A-423399, imaging elements having a photosensitive layer
containing diazonium salts or a diazo resin as described in e.g.
EP-A-450199, imaging elements having a photosensitive layer
containing a photopolymerizable composition as described in e.g.
EP-A-502562, EP-A-491457, EP-A-503602, EP-A-471483 or DE-A-4102173. Alternatively a lithographic printing plate may be prepared from
a heat mode recording material as a lithographic printing plate
precursor. Upon application of a heat pattern in accordance with
image data and optional development the surface of such heat mode
recording material may be differentiated in ink accepting and ink
repellant areas. The heat pattern may be caused by a direct heating
source such as a thermal head but may also be caused by a light
source as
