<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a dielectric antenna duplexer and a
dielectric filter used mainly in high frequency radio devices such
as mobile telephones. An antenna duplexer is a device for sharing
one antenna by a transmitter and a receiver, and it is composed of
a transmission filter and a reception filter. The invention is
particularly directed to a laminated dielectric antenna duplexer
having a laminate structure by laminating a dielectric sheet and an
electrode layer and baking into one body. It also related to a
laminated dielectric filter. The invention is further directed to
a block type dielectric filter applying a circuit construction of
the laminated dielectric filter of the invention into a
conventional dielectric block structure.Along with the advancement of mobile communications, recently,
the antenna duplexer is used widely in many hand-held telephones
and car-mounted telephones. An example of a conventional antenna
duplexer is described below with reference to a drawing.Fig. 20 is a perspective exploded view of a conventional
antenna duplexer. In Fig. 20, reference numerals 701 to 706 are
dielectric coaxial resonators, 707 is a coupling substrate, 708 is
a metallic case, 709 is a metallic cover, 710 to 712 are series
capacitors, 713 and 714 are inductors, 715 to 718 are coupling
capacitors, 721 to 726 are coupling pins, 731 is a transmission 
terminal, 732 is an antenna terminal, 733 is a reception terminal,
and 741 to 747 are electrode patterns formed on the coupling
substrate 707.The dielectric coaxial resonators 701, 702, 703, series
capacitors 710, 711, 712, and inductors 713, 714 are combined to
form a transmission band elimination filter. The dielectric
coaxial resonators 704, 705, 706, and coupling capacitors 715, 716,
717, 718 compose a reception band pass filter.One end of the transmission filter is connected to a
transmission terminal which is electrically connected with a
transmitter, and the other end of the transmission filter is
connected to one end of a reception filter, and is also connected
to an antenna terminal electrically connected to the antenna. The
other end of the reception filter is connected to a reception
terminal which is electrically connected to a receiver.The operation of an antenna duplexeris described below. First
of all, the transmission band elimination filter shows a small
insertion loss to the transmission signal in the transmission
frequency band, and can transmit the transmission signal from the
transmission terminal to the antenna terminal while
