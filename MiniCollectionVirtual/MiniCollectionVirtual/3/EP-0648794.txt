<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a resinous composition
for a water-based paint (hereinafter referred to as water
paint) particularly to a resinous composition for a water
paint crosslinkable at the normal temperature suitable for
painting of the interior and exterior of buildings, bridges,
ships, vehicles and the like.In water paints dryable by crosslinking at normal
temperature, an aqueous dispersion of an acrylic copolymer
has been generally used. For the aqueous dispersion of an
acrylic copolymer, emulsion particles are necessary to be
fused and adhered to each other. Therefore, it is difficult
to increase the Tg (glass transition temperature) of the
resin as to the acrylic copolymer used in the water paint
dryable at normal temperature due to its film forming
property, so that its contamination resistance is lowered
and its water resistance also decreases.On one hand, the market tends to require higher
quality year by year, and properties such as paint film
elasticity, toughness, contamination resistance, acidic rain
resistance and the like equivalent to organic solvent type
urethane paints have been increased also in water paints.On the other hand, with the conventional organic
solvent type urethane paints, it is necessary for there to
be a suitable undercoat in order to withstand the effect of 
solvent used, otherwise it is difficult to apply the paint
particularly in repainting use. Further, aqueous systems
have been recently required because of environmental hygienic
aspects and the fire prevention laws, thus an aqueous
polyurethane paint dryable at the normal temperature having
the same properties as the organic solvent type urethane
paint is strongly desired.There have been carried out up to now some trials
to blend an aqueous dispersion of a carbonyl group-containing
copolymer with an aqueous dispersion of a
urethane polymer having a hydrazide residue for the purpose
of providing a urethane function to an aqueous emulsion (see
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Nos. 1-301761/1989 and 1-301762/1989).
These compositions, however, did not solve
the problem of producing a strong film dryable at normal
temperature, and did not possess the desired product
properties of rapid drying, water resistance, as well as
outdoor stain resistance and acidic rain resistance.The inventors have previously proposed a water
paint dryable at normal temperature in order to solve the
above-mentioned problems, which paint is obtained by
strengthening the film by using a comparatively low molecular
weight crosslinking agent together
