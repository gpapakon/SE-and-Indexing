<ABSTRACT>
A thermal recording material comprises a support 
coated with a colour developing layer, which colour 

developing layer comprises 

(i) a developer which is a bisthiourea compound, 
for example of formula (A-2): 


 
and 
(ii) a colourless dye precursor with which the 
developer reacts upon heating to form a colour. Typically 

the thermal colour developing layer contains no sensitizer. 
In the thermal recording materials of the present 

invention, substantially no colour is developed at a 
temperature of 120°C while colour development can be caused 

in response to heating with a thermal head or a laser beam. 
The developed colour on the material can be erased upon 

contacting with alcoholic solvents, depending on the 
thiourea compound contained in the colour developing layer. 

After erasure of the image, the material can be used again 
for recording with a thermal head or a laser beam.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a thermal
recording material.Typical thermal recording materials comprise a
support such as a sheet of paper, synthesized paper, film
or plastic. The support is coated with a coating solution.
The coating solution comprises an electron-donating,
colorless dye precursor which is normally colorless or
light-colored, and an electron-accepting developer such as a
phenolic compound. The dye precursor and the developer
are separately ground into fine particles and mixed
together, to which a binder, a filler, a sensitizer, a
lubricant and other additives are added. In response to
heating through a thermal head, a thermal pen, a laser beam
or the like, the dye precursor instantaneously reacts with
the developer to provide visible recording images. Such
thermal recording materials have been applied in a wide
range of fields including measuring recorders, printers for
computer terminals, facsimile devices, automatic ticket
vending machines, bar-code labels, etc. The quality
requirement of the consumer for the thermal recording
materials has been sophisticated as the recording devices
have been diversified and had higher performances. For 
example, it has been required to (a) offer high-density and
clear developed images with a smaller amount of thermal
energy to increase recording speed and (b) have good
storability involving light resistance, heat resistance,
water resistance, oil resistance, and plasticizer
resistance.There are now more opportunities than before for
comparing thermal papers with plain papers, with increasing
use of methods of recording data on plain
paper such as electrophotographic methods and ink-jet
recording methods. For instance, preservability of the
resultant images on a thermal recording material is
required to have comparable quality to those recorded with a
toner. On the other hand, preservability of non-recorded
portions (background portions of the paper), hereinafter,
referred to as background preservability, is required to be
close in quality to plain paper. A background
preservability against heat (100°C or higher) or
plasticizers is particularly required.For the background preservability against heat, JP-A-4-353490
(the term "JP-A" as used herein means Japanese
Patent Laid-open, or an "unexamined" published Japanese
patent application) discloses a thermal recording material
in which background or whiteness and density of recorded
portion do not deteriorate in a high temperature
environment of around 90°C. More specifically, the
background of this
