<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a flow passage 
change-over apparatus of a simple construction 

capable of carrying out a change-over operation at 
a high speed without causing the leakage of a gas 

between two systems of flow passages, for example, 
two flow passages through which two kinds of 

gases of different temperatures are introduced. A 
casing of the apparatus is divided by partitions (5, 

6, 7) into a total of four chambers, i.e. two fixed 
chambers (2a, 2b) connected to two systems of 

flow passages in which the directions of flow of 
fluids are fixed, and two change-over chambers 

(4c, 4d) connected to two systems of flow passages 
in which the directions of flow of fluids can be 

changed over alternately. The two fixed chambers 
(2a, 2b) are allowed to communicate with different 

change-over chambers (4c, 4d) alternately by the 
change-over means (3). A regenerative alternate 

combustion burner system is formed by using this 
flow passage change-over apparatus, or a regenerative 

heat exchanger system is formed by installing 
the flow passage change-over apparatuses changing 

the direction of a flow of a fluid by the upstream 
side flow passage change-over apparatus 

and changing after the passage of the fluid 
through the heat accumulator the direction of the flow of the fluid to the original direction by the downstream 

side flow passage 
change-over apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a flow switching 
apparatus preferable for switching two gas flow systems, a 
regenerative heat exchanger system and a regenerative 
alternate combustion burner system both using the apparatus. 
More particularly, the present invention relates to: a flow 
switching apparatus for switching two flow systems, e.g., one 
flow in which the high temperature gas flows and another flow 
in which the low temperature gas flows; a regenerative heat 
exchanger system such as an waste heat recovery system or a 
regenerative heat exchanger for alternately flowing two types 
of fluid each having a different temperature through a 
regenerator to effect heat exchange; and a regenerative 
alternate combustion burner system using the apparatus. The technique for recovering the considerable quantity of 
heat from the exhaust gas by using a regenerator to preheat 
the air for combustion has been recently developed. For  
 
example, a radiant tube burner having the configuration such 
as shown in Fig. 8 is proposed. In this burner, two burners 
103 each having a regenerator 102 are fixed at both ends of a 
radiant tube 101, and combustion is alternately performed at 
the two burners 103. When combustion is effected at one 
burner 103, the produced combustion gas is exhausted through 
the regenerator 102 provided at the other burner 103 where no 
burning is made for preheating the air for combustion by using 
the heat of the combustion gas accumulated in the regenerator 
102. In such a regenerative alternate combustion burner 
system, the regenerator requires a flow switching apparatus 
for switching a flow through which the high temperature 
exhaust gas flows to another flow through which the low 
temperature air for combustion flows, and vice versa. 
Conventionally, a solenoid valve has been generally adopted as 
such a flow switching apparatus in the combustion system. For 
example, as shown in Fig. 6, the prior art apparatus has a 
configuration in which the solenoid valves 104, 105, 106 and 
107 are provided at four positions and are selectively opened 
or closed to switch the flows for two kinds of gas having high 
and low temperatures. In the drawing, reference numerals 108 
and 109 designate the solenoid valves for selectively opening 
or closing a fuel supply system 110. The flow switching apparatus having the solenoid valves  
 
therein however requires a plurality of expensive solenoid 
valves, thus increasing the production cost. In particular, 
application of the apparatus to a
