<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus for 
supplying steam into a silo (1) comprising 

a bottom (3), a wall and a discharger 
with a discharger arm (6) placed in the 

lower part of the silo and mounted in the 
bottom by means of a bearing. According 

to the invention, the silo is provided 
with a steam supplying element, such as a 

steam feed pipe (14), extending from the 
central part of the bottom (3) into the 

interior of the silo. The feed pipe (14) 
is preferably passed through the bearing 

of the discharger and the end of the pipe 
(14) is provided with a cap (16) protecting 

the nozzles (15).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for steaming a 
material in a silo, according to the preamble of claim 1. In pulp industry, the wood used as raw material is cut into 
chips as required for the production process. Besides external 
dimensions, the chips must be of the right quality with 
respect to other properties as well. The chips are conveyed 
into a steaming silo and from there further to the pulping 
process. In the silo, the moisture of the chips is adjusted 
to a suitable level by supplying steam into the silo. At the 
same time, the air among the chips, which is detrimental to 
the pulping process, is removed. In previously known technology, the steam is passed into the 
silo via steam pipes with nozzles placed at different 
heights on the silo walls or on the bottom of the silo. In 
these solutions, the steam is unevenly distributed in different 
parts of the silo, because the area close to the 
nozzle receives most steam while the areas farthest away, 
especially in the horizontal direction, receive least steam. 
To achieve uniform moisture, the pressure or amount of steam 
or the number of steam pipes and nozzles has to be increased. 
Both solutions are expensive to implement and they also 
increase the number of parts requiring service. The object of the invention is to achieve a steam supplying 
apparatus allowing the steam to be evenly distributed in the 
whole mass of chips in a chip silo. To implement this, the 
invention is characterized by the features specified in the 
characterization part of claim 1. Other embodiments of the 
invention are characterized by the features presented in the 
subclaims. With the apparatus of the invention, the steam can be uniformly 
distributed in different parts of the silo, so that  
 
the whole mass of chips is steamed. In this solution, no 
ducts for steam pipes are required in the walls of the silo 
because the pipes are passed through the bearing of a discharger 
mounted at the bottom. In the following, the invention is described by the aid of 
one of its embodiments by referring to the drawings, in which 
Fig. 1 presents the bottom of a silo in top view , Fig. 2 presents the silo bottom of fig. 1 as sectioned 
along line A - A. Fig. 3 presents the silo bottom of fig. 1 as sectioned 
along line B - B. Fig. 1 illustrates the structure of the bottom of the silo 1 
as seen from above. The silo consists of a cylindrical wall 
2 attached at its lower edge to a bottom plate 3 and at the 
upper edge to a top structure (not shown). The chips
