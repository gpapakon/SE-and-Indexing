<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed herein is a surface latent image type 
silver halide photographic emulsion containing silver 

halide grains which have been formed in the presence of 
a tellurium compound which forms silver telluride in 

silver bromide emulsion at a pseudo-first-order reaction 
rate constant k of 1 × 10⁻⁷ min⁻¹ to 1 × 10⁻¹ min⁻¹, and 

in which tellurium ions have been thereby doped. Also 
disclosed is a surface latent image type silver halide 

photographic emulsion containing silver halide grains 
which have been formed by adding at least one labile 

tellurium compound selected from the group consisting 
of an organic compound containing tellurium single-bonded 

directly to S, SO, SO₂, Se, P=O or P=S, a cyclic 
organic compound having at least one tellurium atom and 

two or more chalcogen atoms in a ring, and an organic 
compound containing tellurium anions, and in which 

tellurium ions have been thereby doped.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide
photographic emulsion, and more particularly to a
surface latent image type silver halide photographic
emulsion containing silver halide grains which have been
formed by using a labile tellurium compound suitable for
forming silver telluride, whereby tellurium ions are
doped into the silver halide grains, and which exhibits
sensitivity improved particularly when exposed to the
illumination of low intensity for a long time or when
subjected to spectral sensitization.In recent years, it has been increasingly demanded
that silver halide photographic light-sensitive
materials have higher sensitivity, better graininess,
higher gradation and higher sharpness, and also greater
process-readiness such as development processing readiness.Generally, a silver halide photographic emulsion
is spectrally sensitized with a sensitizing dye to be
photographically sensitive to light beams in a wavelength
region, such as green light, red light and
infrared rays, which the silver halide cannot absorb.
To acquire desired sensitivity, desired gradation, and
the like, the emulsion is subjected to so-called chemical
sensitization, such as chalcogen sensitization
(e.g., sulfur sensitization, selenium sensitization, or
tellurium sensitization), noble metal sensitization 
(e.g., gold sensitization), or reduction sensitization,
or a combination of these.Apart from this, efforts have been made to improve
the photographic sensitivity of the surface of silver
halide grains by doping ions different from silver ions
and halogen ions into the silver halide grains.In particular, some techniques are known which
consists in doping the anions of different kinds, more
specifically ions of Sulfur Group (known also as VIB
Group, or chalcogen) atom, such as sulfur, selenium, or
tellurium, into the silver halide grains. U.S. Patent
3,772,031, for example, discloses the technique of
uniformly doping the ions of Sulfur Group atom used in
concentration of 2 to 10 ppm into the silver halide
grains, thereby to increase the surface sensitivity of
the grains.JP-C-4-506267 (corresponding to WO 90-16014 and
also to U.S. Patent 5,166,045) discloses the technique
of doping the ions of Sulfur Group atom, particularly
selenium ions (selenocyanate) into the 65 to 90% of all
silver used in forming silver halide grains. ("JP-C"
means Published Unexamined PCT Domestic Patent

doping the ions of Sulfur Group atom and an ion compound
into the grains in an
