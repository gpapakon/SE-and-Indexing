<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus 1 for widening a foam sheet S obtained immediately after 
heating and foaming a foam sheet which has not been yet widened, while the foam 

sheet S is continuously received or supplied. The sheet widening apparatus1 
comprises: a pair of chains 2 constructed in the form of endless chains 

composed of links 22 having pin parts 21 and a driving device 3 meshing with 
these chains 2 and driving the chains 2 along such loci as to widen the space 

between the chains 2 from sheet receiving start points to sheet receving end 
points. A method for widening a foam sheet by the sheet widening apparatus 1 

comprises the steps of piercing both the side parts of the foam sheet S with 
the pins 21 at the sheet receiving start points; widening the space of width 

between the pins 21 along gently curved loci by drving the chains 2 while the 
pins 21 penetrating the foam sheet; and receiving
 the foam sheet S from the 
sheet receiving start points to the sheet receiving end Points while the foam 

sheet is widened. The foam sheet S obtained after the widening step in 
accordance with the sheet widening method.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a method and an apparatus for widening a foam sheet.Generally, in case where a foam sheet is heated and softened to form mold
goods, the mold goods have been sometimes wrinkled in accordance with the
slackening phenomenon (draw-down) of the foam sheet caused by the self-weight
of the foam sheet, or the thickness of the foam sheet has not been uniform, so
that the commercial value of the mold goods is deteriorated.Thus, in order to obtain a foam sheet in which a draw-down phenomenon
thereof at the time of thermally forming it, a technique has been conventionally
known that a foam sheet obtained immediately after a foam sheet is foamed by
heating in the manufacturing step thereof is widened.As a method for widening a foam sheet obtained immediately after foaming a
foam sheet which has not been yet widened, a sheet widening technique such as a
technique using a belt-rotary type or disk rotary-type sheet widening apparatus
has been known which is vacuum-attached to both the ends of a foam sheet to
increase the width of the foam sheet (For example, refer to, Japanese Examined
Patent Publication No. 48-9955).As an alternative method for widening a foam sheet, a sheet widening
method using a sheet widening apparatus has been known which is adapted to
increase the width of the foam sheet while both the ends of the foam sheet are
held by holding parts including a pair of rotary belt like supporters and a 
plurality of holding wheels for holding both the end parts of the foam sheet
(For example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2-72938).However, the above mentioned conventional sheet widening techniques are
methods for increasing the width of a foam sheet merely by a vacuum force or
a holding power, and therefore, the foam sheet cannot be always held completely.
Thus, a problem that the foam sheet is slipped or displaced upon widening or
the foam sheet cannot be widened with a sufficient holding power is liable to
arise.Therefore, the foam sheet to be widened in accordance with these techniques
can be widened only within the range of the holding power of the holding parts,
so that a completely widened foam sheet cannot be obtained.In the case of the sheet widening apparatus using the vacuum- attaching
means, such a disadvantage arises that the apparatus is complicated or becomes
large in size in order to obtain a satisfactory vacuum force.Further, also in the case of the sheet widening apparatus using the holding
parts for holding a foam sheet, a problem resides
