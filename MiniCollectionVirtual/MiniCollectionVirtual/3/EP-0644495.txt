<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data reproduction apparatus for successively
reproducing a plurality of scene files composing stored data (including at least sound,
still photographs, and texts) as per user's manipulation.Data reproduction apparatuses that reproduce digital data as per user's
manipulation use a CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read Only Memory) as a data storage
medium, which can store a broad range of media including sound, still photographs,
moving pictures, texts, characters, program data, etc. Accordingly, applications such
that handle the media stored in the CD-ROM as integrated data, or so-called multi-media
applications, have been developed and are in practical use in the field of
entertainment, presentation, and electronic books.A single channel information retrieval system is described in European patent
application EP-A-0 528 425. The system comprises a CD-ROM which stores
reproduction data such as voice data, image data and text data as well as reproduction
data management information. This information includes address information and
continuous reproduction information which specify the location of the data and whether
that data is to be reproduced continuously or selectively. This system does not have the
capability to perform branching and hence there is no appreciation of the reproduction
problems associated therewith.An electronic book application, one of the multi-media applications, has the
same structure as a book in terms of the articles or the table of contents to reproduce
books electronically from the digital data including at least three elements: sound, still
photographs, and texts. Unlike a music application that reproduces stored data
successively through a single channel (no branch channels exist in this application), the
electronic application reproduces articles, 
which are the minimum units of data for reproduction, through
a number of channels by means of an electronic book player
(data reproduction apparatus). More precisely, the channels
are selected by the user where the selection is possible, for
example at the table of contents, and the data are reproduced
through the selected channels.The selection of the reproduction channel with the
electronic book player will be explained with reference to
FIG. 1, which schematically shows stored data having a
plurality of reproduction channels (branches).Once the reproduction operation starts, a scene file Y1
is reproduced first, and then a scene file Y2. Since scene
files Y3, Y7, and Y10 are branched from the scene file
