<ABSTRACT>
A cerumen barrier for a custom, in the ear type hearing instrument which consists, in combination, of a sound outlet base (4) and a barrier door (9) which prevents ear wax from reaching and damaging the internal components of a hearing instrument, particularly the transducer, in an arrangement which facilitates an accelerated and simplified attachment to the hearing instrument as compared with the state of art. The sound outlet base comprises a cylindrical component (3), incorporating a bore insertable into the sound outlet port (2), and a counter-bore (10), which joins to the male connector (8) on the barrier door.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to hearing instruments.Cerumen traps which prevent the ingress of ear wax into the hearing
instrument and other cerumen traps which reduce the likelihood of ear wax blocking
the sound outlet are already known.From U.S. Patent 4,972,488 which describes clearly detailed barrier designs
which use a fine mesh screen in the sound channel wherein if sufficiently small screen
holes are used, will eventually clog with wax and conversely when mesh is made with
wider screen holes, wax will eventually migrate across the screen and damage the
transducer. Such cellular synthetic screens can increase acoustic impedance between
the transducer and the ear drum which may modify the frequency response and
acoustic gain of the hearing aid device.In summary, US Patent No. 4,972,488 discloses a hearing instrument
comprising a shell housing with a tip that has a sound outlet port, and a cerumen
barrier comprising a central bore having a plurality of projections provided therein,
the projections together defining a tortuous path through the central bore, and a mesh
screen covering the outer end of the barrier.From U.S Patent 5,105,904 arrangements which utilize wax filters or caps
necessitate the need to replace such filters when clogged with wax. Clogging can
occur gradually depending upon variances of cerumen production in different hearing
instrument wearers or immediately upon inserting the hearing instrument into the ear
canal.In the gradual clogging process, the wearer's perceived sound quality may
gradually worsen evidenced by acoustic feedback or lack of output. The wearer must
purchase or otherwise obtain additional filters or tools for replacement of the filters.
First the wearer needs to visually verify the filter or screen that needs changing or
the cap is clogged. Visual acuity and finger dexterity are necessary for proper
replacement and realignment for such filters or caps. Other 
mechanical, internal defects can develop in hearing
instruments which display the same failure characteristics
as wax clogging does, thereby leading to frustration when
filter replacement does not alleviate an internal failure.
Often times, it is more desirable for a trained hearing aid
professional to clean the hearing instrument and verify
specifications in order to reduce the wearer's frustration
and chance of improper installation resulting in filters,
screens or caps falling off the unit or into the wearer's
ear canal. Thus it is desirable to have a barrier which
does not need replacement over the life of

<CLAIMS>
A hearing instrument comprising:

a shell housing (1) with a tip which presents a sound outlet port (2);
a cerum barrier comprising:

(i) a sound outlet base component (4) having:

a bore defining a central axis for the passage of sound, the bore having a
diameter which is at least about 1.02mm and at most about 3.81mm the passage of

sound having a cylindrical component (3) insertable into said sound outlet port (2), the
cylindrical component (3) having a bore of the same diameter as the bore defining the

central axis for the passage of sound, and having a depth which is at least 0.25mm and
at most about 2.54mm extending from the base component (4), the central axis for the

passage of sound being elongate and also defined by the interior wall surface of said
cylindrical component (3);
a counter-bore (10) having a top hole (22) with a diameter of at minimum
about 0.13mm and at a maximum about 3.05mm, and having a depth which is at

minimum about 0.13mm and at maximum about 2.54mm; and
a detent cavity (11) capable of accepting a projecting detent of a minimum
radius of about 0.03mm and a maximum radius of about 0.38mm, and having a

maximum length of about 0.76mm;
the base component (4) having a perimeter which is, at the minimum, limited
by the outside perimeter of the bore defining the central axis for the passage of sound

and the 
outside perimeter of the counter-bore 10, and at the maximum, a perimeter which is

very large in comparison to the diameter of the bore defining the central axis for the
passage of sound, exceeding the tip diameter of the shell housing (1), thereby requiring

trimming of the perimeter of said base component (4) to match the contour of the
hearing aid shell before insertion of the instrument into the ear; and
(ii) a barrier door (9) having:

a male connector (8) which is fittable into the counter-bore (10) of the base
component (4), the connector comprising a solid cylinder (20) with a cap (21) at the

end of said cylinder, the cap (21) having a conical surface with a maximum diameter
which is greater than the diameter of the top hole (22) in the counter-bore (10), which

in cooperation with the barrier door (9), allows said connector (8) to rotate within the
base component (4);
a detent (12) which projects from the bottom surface of the barrier door (9) and
which in cooperation with the detent cavity (11) of the base component (4) properly

aligns the door (9) and the base component (4) such that their respective perimeters
are flush; and
a sound outlet channel (16), positioned above the cylindrical component (3)
when the barrier door (9) is properly aligned with the base component (4), the channel

(16) having a width which is at a minimum about 0.76mm and at a maximum about
3.81mm and a height which is at a minimum about 0.13mm and at a maximum about

0.76mm, and a length extending such that sound may exit from both lateral sides of
the barrier door (9) when said door is properly aligned with the base component (4);
the barrier door (9) having a height of a minimum of about 0.25mm and a
maximum of about 2.54mm; a top surface area which is contoured to disallow any

significant edges which could contact the ear canal creating discomfort during
insertion; and a perimeter which is, at a minimum, flush with the perimeter of the top

of said base component (4) at the surface between the two components; and, at a
maximum, 

as large as the perimeter of the tip of the shell housing (1).
A hearing instrument according to Claim 1, wherein said male connector (8)
has a polyhedron surface rather than a cylindrical surface.
A hearing instrument according to Claim 1, wherein said cap (21) of said male
connector (8) has a polyhedron surface rather than a conical surface.
