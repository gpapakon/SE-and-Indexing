<ABSTRACT>
In this safety circuit, a transmitter (1) produces a non-electric signal which is guided by a first conductor section (2) to a locking device (3) of a first hall door. In the operating position shown of the locking device (3) of the first hall door, the non-electric signal is directed by means of a second conductor section (4) arranged on the locking device (3) of the first hall door to a third conductor section (5) and from the latter to a locking device (3) of a second hall door. In the neutral position shown of the locking device (3) of the second hall door, the non-electric signal is not directed to a fifth conductor section (8) by means of a fourth conductor section (7) arranged on the locking device (3) of the second hall door, so that the fifth conductor section (8) does not transmit the non-electric signal to a receiver (9). To check the transmitter (1), the receiver (9) and the conductor sections (2; 4; 5; 7; 8), on the one hand a direct conductor (10) is provided for testing the transmitter (1) and the receiver (9) and on the other hand sensors (11; 12; 13) are provided for testing the conductor sections (2; 4; 5; 7; 8). A sensor (11; 12; 13) is provided for each conductor section, the signal of which sensor (11; 12; 13) is fed to a failure-recognition circuit (14).
