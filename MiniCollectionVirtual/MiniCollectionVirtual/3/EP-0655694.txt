<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is an improved discrete cosine transform 
processor comprising an input unit for receiving image date 

to be processed, a storage unit for previously storing a 
result of a multiplication and accumulation calculation 

effected beforehand with respect to image input data and 
transform matrix components so that the same value is read 

from the same read line; a decoding unit for selecting the 
read line, in which each bit value of the image input data 

composed of a plurality of bits serves as a piece of 
address data; an accumulation unit for accumulating the 

data read from the storage unit and an output unit for 
outputting a result of the accumulation processing as 

output data. The storage unit uses the common data in 
common when effecting the multiplication and accumulation 

calculation, and, hence, a storage capacity is reduced, 
thereby making it possible to decrease a chip area.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a discrete
cosine transform (DCT) processor and, more particularly, to
a DCT processor suitable for use to compress and expand
image data.Roughly, two types of arithmetic methods have hitherto
been conventionally employed for an LSI for performing
arithmetic processing of a forward discrete cosine
transform/inverse discrete cosine transform (DCT/IDCT).According to the first type of arithmetic method, the
operation is effected by use of a multiplier in accordance
with a definition expression of the DCT/IDCT. That is, a
ROM (read only memory) records precalculated
transform coefficients of the DCT/IDCT. The corresponding
coefficients are sequentially read from this ROM, and the
multiplier performs a multiplication and accumulation
operation of this item of coefficient data and image data
to be inputted. For example, if an 8 x 8 pixel DCT/IDCT
processor is used, eight units of multipliers are used
for effecting the operation in parallel, or alternatively,
a single unit of multiplier is employed for performing
operation sequentially.The second type of arithmetic method is a distributed
arithmetic (DA) method. This DA method was designed to
avoid such an inconvenience that the multipliers occupy a
large area on the LSI and to attain a higher operating
speed. According to the DA method, multiplying the input
image data by a cosine coefficient is not actually
conducted by the multiplier, and, instead, an accumulation
is effected by use of an adder after the ROM has stored a
result of a precalculated multiplication and accumulation.
This DA method is based on the premise that the ROM rather
than the multiplier is capable of performing the same
function with a smaller area on the LSI owing to an
advancement of techniques for the semiconductor memory. The DA method involves, in the case of, e.g., an 8 x 8
pixel DCT/IDCT, the use of eight units of ROMs. A storage
capacity required for each of the eight ROMs is 28 = 256
words. Generally, an input to the DCT processor is 9 bits
per word, while an input to the IDCT processor is 12 bits
per word. One word is expanded
to 16 bits in the interior of the processor.Given herein is an explanation of an example of the
conventional DCT processor for performing the DA
processing. Note that a one-dimensional DCT processor
serving as a basis will be discussed. It is because a so-called
two-dimensional DCT is attained by effecting a
column-directional DCT with respect to (m x n) pixel sample
data and further repeating a row-directional
