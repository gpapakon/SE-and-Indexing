<ABSTRACT>
A drug capsule (10) comprising a sleeve (12) whose open ends are closed by a pair of opposite end caps (16, 18) which are displaceably connected to the sleeve. The end faces (22, 30) of the end caps are frangible so that they can be ruptured by the open ends of the sleeve by causing the end caps to be displaced along the sleeve towards one another to open the capsule. An inhalation device for use with a drug capsule with frangible end caps comprises a mouth piece (412) and a tail piece (414) adapted to receive between them in a chamber defined by the interengaged pieces (412, 414) such a drug capsule (310). The mouth piece (412) and the tail piece (414) each comprise abutment faces (419, 439, 439') for stops (313, 313', 332) on the end caps (316, 318) of a drug capsule. When the two pieces (412, 414) are pushed together, so are the end caps, which are thereby ruptured by the ends of the sleeve (312).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a drug dispensing
system which is particularly useful for administering
powdered drugs by inhalation. The drug dispensing
system comprises a drug dispenser and a drug capsule,
each of which is included in the
invention.The invention relates
to a drug capsule which is particularly useful for a
powdered dose form of medicine which is administered
by inhalation. Thus the capsule of the present
invention normally would be non-soluble and not
intended to be consumed. The capsule is intended for
use as a drug cartridge which can be ruptured at such
time as administration is required whereby the drug
can be readily and efficiently extracted from the
capsule.In known powder dose inhalation devices, for
example, as described in FR-A-2352556, it is common to
use known capsules which comprise a soluble case of
gelatin which encloses a dose of medicine. Such
capsules are inserted in an inhaler device either as a
single dose or in an array for multiple-dose usage
and, at the appropriate time, when a patient requires
the powdered dose to be administered, the capsule is
pierced or sheared whereafter the patient inhales to
entrain the powdered dosage of medicine in a stream of
inhaled air.It is also known to provide a mixing capsule, for
example, as described in FR-A-1499518. This document
discloses in fact a capsule comprising a sleeve having 
a tubular side wall portion defining a compartment and
having an open end, a first end cap connected to the
sleeve and comprising a body portion and an end wall
portion (rupturable member) sealing the sleeve. The
sleeve comprises a cutting edge which, upon movement
of the cap towards the end of the sleeve, will be
severed to form a disc and define an opening. This
opening allows for communication with the interior of
the sleeve. Though this capsule is primarily intended
for mixing dental amalgam, it can also be used for
drugs.The present invention provides a drug capsule
comprising a sleeve forming a side wall of the capsule
and having first and second ends, a displaceable first
end cap closing the first end of the sleeve, the first end
cap (16) having a first end face which can be ruptured by
the first end of the sleeve by urging the first end
end against the first end of the sleeve to open the
capsule by at least partially severing the first end
face to form a disc of material, characterised in that
the second end of the sleeve is closed by a rupturable
and displaceable second end cap in like manner to the
first end, the second end cap thereby
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A drug capsule (10) comprising a sleeve (12)
forming a side wall of the capsule and having first

and second ends, a displaceable first end cap (16)
closing the first end of the sleeve, the first end cap (16)

having a first end face (22) which can be ruptured by
the first end of the sleeve by urging the first end

cap against the first end of the sleeve to open the
capsule by at least partially severing the first end

face to form a disc of material, characterised in that
the second end of the sleeve is closed by a rupturable

and displaceable second end cap (18) in like manner to
the first end, the second end cap thereby comprising a

second end face (30) which can be ruptured by the
second end of the sleeve by urging the second end cap

against the second end of the sleeve to open the
capsule by at least partially severing the second end

face to form a second disc of material.
A drug capsule according to claim 1, wherein
the first and second ends of the sleeve comprise

respective ellipses, the plane of each ellipse being
at an angle to a plane normal to the axes of the

sleeve so as to form respective first and second
cutting edges (12c,12c') which can cut progressively

through the first and second end faces of the first
and second end caps respectively.
A drug capsule according to any preceding
claim wherein the first and second end caps are

displaceably connected to the sleeve by respective rib
and groove (R
1
,26; R
2
,34) connections.
A drug capsule according to any preceding
claim wherein the first and second end faces of the 

end caps remain hinged to the respective first and
second end caps after being ruptured and displaced

along the sleeve.
A drug capsule according to any one of the
preceding claims formed from a plastics material.
A drug capsule according to any preceding
claim wherein the sleeve is provided with an outwardly

projecting flange (14) or other stop means
intermediate its ends, against which the end caps abut

when fully displaced along the sleeve from its ends.
A dispenser (210) formed from the
combination of a capsule according to any preceding

claim and a pair of elements (212,214), the elements
each being adapted to receive a separate one of the

first and second end caps of the capsule so that the
capsule interconnects the elements, and wherein one of

the elements provides a mouth piece (212) and the
capsule can be ruptured by moving the elements towards

one another whereby the ruptured capsule provides a
part of an air flow passageway of the dispenser so

that in use a dose of powder contained within the
capsule can be inhaled through the mouth piece.
A dispenser as claimed in claim 7 wherein
the other of the elements comprises a tail piece (214)

including an end part (234) which forms an elbow in
the air flow passageway of the dispenser so that in

use powder from the capsule is not lost through an
open end of the tail piece.
A dispenser according to any of claims 7 and
8 wherein means (236,238) are provided in said tail

piece to induce a turbulent air flow through the 

dispenser in use.
A dispenser as claimed in any of claims 7 to
9 wherein the first and second end caps comprise

radially projecting flanges (24,32) defining abutment
surfaces engagable by co-operating abutment surfaces

of the elements whereby in use relative displacement
of the elements effects relative displacement of the

end caps to provide the actuating movement relative to
the side wall portion.
