<ABSTRACT>
A semiconductor-device package (20) includes a printed 
circuit board (21) which has a chip-accommodating hole (25) 

in its centre and which has external connection terminals 
(24) formed on one side and a flexible substrate (26) which 

has a supporting film (27) having a central hole aligned 
with the chip-accommodating hole (25). A circuit pattern 

(28) is formed on the supporting film (27) and inner 
leads (28b) project inside the central hole (25) to form 

micro patterns. The flexible substrate (27) is bonded on 
the other side of the printed circuit board (21) and an 

electrical connection is formed between its circuit pattern 
(28) and that of the circuit board (21).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a
semiconductor-device package and a semiconductor device.A TAB (Tab Automated Bonding) tape comprises a
heat resistant support film (for example, a polyimide film
or the like) and a circuit pattern made of copper foil
formed on the support film, the circuit pattern having
inner leads projecting inside an element-accommodating hole
of the support film and outer leads projecting outside the
support film.A conventional bonding technique using this TAB
tape makes it possible to facilitate tests of semiconductor
elements (chips) before packaging them, to simultaneously
bond a narrow-pitch chip whose pitch width is so narrow
that this chip cannot be simultaneously bonded by means of
a conventional multi-pin and wire-bonding technique.
Furthermore such a TAB tape bonding technique is superior
to wire-bonding technique with regard to its high frequency
properties and is suitable to high density packaging.
Therefore, such a TAB tape bonding technique is very
appropriate to a multi-pin, narrow-pitch and high-speed
chip, such as a CPU chip or the like.However, in such a conventional TAB tape bonding
technique, both inner lead bonding and outer lead bonding
is required and, as a result, a large number of working
man-hours are inevitably required. In addition to this,
because of requirements for mounting the package on a
substrate, the pitch width between outer leads cannot be
made narrow in the same manner as the pitch width between
inner leads and, for this reason, the outer leads must
project beyond its support film. Thus, according to such a
conventional TAB tape bonding technique, the overall size
of a semiconductor device typically becomes larger when a
chip is mounted on it, which is contrary to demands of
miniaturization. Furthermore, when such a conventional TAB tape
bonding technique is applied to a high-power chip such as
a CPU chip or the like, complex and expensive packaging is
necessary because adaptation to a heat radiating structure
is difficult to obtain.EP-A-0352429 discloses a TAB package which includes a
heatsink thermally connected to the semiconductor chip
enabling the radiation of heat. Accordingly this package
is suited for higher-power chips.EP-A-0,524,761 also discloses a package including a
heatsink, although in this case the package is a plastic
pin grid array (PPGA) package. In this form of package,
the semiconductor device is electrically connected to a
printed wiring board which includes the heatsink. The
heatsink is thermally connected to a number of
