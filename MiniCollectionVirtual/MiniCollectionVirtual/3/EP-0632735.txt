<ABSTRACT>
An intraurethral, Foley-type catheter shaft (32) contains a microwave antenna (74), which is surrounded by means (64A-64B, 66A-66B) within the shaft (32) for asymmetrically absorbing electromagnetic energy emitted by the antenna (74) - a greater amount of electromagnetic energy being absorbed on one side of the shaft (32). This asymmetrical absorption effectively focuses microwave thermal therapy toward undesirous benign tumorous tissue growth of a prostate anterior and lateral to the urethra, and protects healthy tissue posterior to the urethra. Means (64A-64B, 66A-66B) also absorbs thermal energy conducted by the periurethral tissue, which protects the urethra while the antenna (74) is energized.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the field of
microwave thermal therapy of tissue. In particular, the
present invention relates to a device for
transurethral microwave thermal therapy of benign
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), as stated in the preamble of claim 1.The prostate gland is a complex, chestnut-shaped
organ which encircles the urethra immediately
below the bladder. Nearly one third of the prostate
tissue anterior to the urethra consists of fibromuscular
tissue that is anatomically and functionally related to
the urethra and bladder. The remaining two thirds of
the prostate is generally posterior to the urethra and
is comprised of glandular tissue.This relatively small organ, which is the most
frequently diseased of all internal organs, is the site
of a common affliction among older men: BPH (benign
prostatic hyperplasia). BPH is a nonmalignant,
bilateral nodular expansion of prostrate tissue in the
transition zone, a periurethral region of the prostate
between the fibromuscular tissue and the glandular
tissue. The degree of nodular expansion within the
transition zone tends to be greatest anterior and
lateral to the urethra, relative to the posterior-most
region of the urethra. Left untreated, BPH causes
obstruction of the urethra which usually results in
increased urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence,
nocturia and slow or interrupted urinary stream. BPH
may also result in more severe complications, such as
urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention,
hydronephrosis and uraemia. Traditionally, the most frequent treatment for
BPH has been surgery (transurethral resection).
Surgery, however, is often not an available method of
treatment for a variety of reasons. First, due to the
advanced age of many patients with BPH, other health
problems, such as cardiovascular disease, can warrant
against surgical intervention. Second, potential
complications associated with transurethral surgery,
such as hemorrhage, anesthetic complications, urinary
infection, dysuria, incontinence and retrograde
ejaculation, can adversely affect a patient's
willingness to undergo such a procedure.A fairly recent alternative treatment method
for BPH involves microwave thermal therapy, in which
microwave energy is employed to elevate the temperature
of tissue surrounding the prostatic urethra above about
45Â°C, thereby thermally damaging the tumorous tissue.
Delivery of microwave energy to tumorous prostatic
tissue is generally accomplished by a microwave antenna-containing
applicator, which is positioned within a body

<CLAIMS>
A device for transurethral thermal therapy of tissue
surrounding a urethra comprising a urethral probe (32),

an antenna (74) placed in the urethral probe (32), and
cooling means (64A-64B, 66A-66B) around the antenna (74)

and extending along the probe in an axial direction,
the cooling means (64A-64B, 66A-66B)

comprises anterior energy absorbing means (64A-64B)
and posterior energy absorbing means (66A-66B), wherein

the anterior energy absorbing means (64A-64B) comprises.
at least one lumen (64A-64B) circumjacent a first side

(68) of urethral probe (32), and wherein the posterior
energy absorbing means (66A-66B) comprises at least one

lumen (66A or 66B) circumjacent a second side (72) of
urethral probe (32), 
characterized in that
 the at least one lumen (66A-66B) circumjacent
the second side of the probe has a cross-sectional

width which is greater than that of the at
least one lumen (64A-64B) circumjacent the first side of the probe

so that when the cooling means (64A-64B, 66A-66B)
are provided with fluid, a greater amount of energy

emitted by the antenna is absorbed on the second side
(72) of the probe (32) than on the first side (68) of the

probe (32) and thereby generating a cylindrically
asymmetrical heating pattern. 
The device of claim 1 wherein the antenna (74) is positioned within the
urethral probe (32) so as to be located closer to a first side (68) of the urethral probe (32)

than to a second side (72) of the urethral probe (32).
The device of claims 1 or 2 and further comprising means (36) for
supplying the at least one lumen (64A or 64B) circumjacent the first side (68) of the

urethral probe (32) and the at least one lumen (66A or 66B) circumjacent the second side
(72) of the urethral probe (32) with a liquid capable of absorbing energy emitted by the

antenna (74).
The device of claims 1, 2 or 3 wherein the antenna (74) is a
microwave antenna.
