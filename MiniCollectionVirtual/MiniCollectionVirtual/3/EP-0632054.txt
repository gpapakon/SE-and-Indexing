<ABSTRACT>
An invention is described that permits the regulation of recombination in cells, organism or 
appropriate cell-free systems. The invention involves creating fusion proteins between 

recombinase proteins, or components of recombinase systems, and ligand binding domains 
derived from nuclear receptors. The fusion proteins show little recombinase activity in the 

absence of the ligand that binds to the ligand binding domain. Upon binding of the ligand, 

recombinase activity is induced. The invention provides a practical means to regulate 
recombination in cells and organisms and, by linking ligand binding to recombination, 

provides a simple means whereby ligand binding can be measured as recombination achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technical field of genetic manipulation, and more 
specifically, to the use of recombination-mediated DNA rearrangements and to the use of the 
regulatory potential of nuclear receptors. The use of site specific recombinases (SSRs) to induce defined rearrangements of DNA has 
been described in a variety of organisms ( 1-12). These reports describe the introduction of a 
DNA construct that contains SSR target sites. Subsequent exposure to the SSR enzyme activity 
resulted in the DNA rearrangement determined by the disposition of the target sites, (see 
reference 13 for a recent review of SSRs). Three SSRs have been used in this manner to date; 
FLP recombinase from the 2µ episome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1,2,5,6,9,10). CRE  
 
recombinase from the Escherichia coli phage P1 (3,4,8,11,12) and R recombinase from pSR1 
of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii (7). Amongst other SSR systems relevant to the invention 
descibed here are those listed in references 13 and 14, and SSRs from Kluyveromyces 
drosophilarium (15), Kluyveromyces waltii (16), λ Int (17) and the Gin recombination 
system from phage Mu (18). For many applications in cells, organisms and cell-free in vitro systems, SSR induced DNA 
rearrangements must be regulated. Current implementation of the potential offered by SSRs is 
limited by the means available to regulate SSR activity. In experiments with cultured cells, 
unregulated SSRs have been used. For example, after introduction of SSR target sites into 
cells, recombination has been induced by subsequent introduction of either FLP recombinase 
by transfection of DNA (4,9) or injection of CRE recombinase protein (12). That is, the 
intended recombination event was regulated merely by the time of introduction of an 
appropriate macromolecule. Amongst other limitations, this precludes the creation and 
proliferation of homogenous populations of cells that contain both the unrearranged target sites 
and the SSR and in which the recombination event can be induced after cell numbers have been 
expanded. In experiments with transgenic animals, the issue of SSR regulation has been addressed by 
regulating the expression of an introduced SSR gene using the inducible heat-shock promoter 
in Drosophila (5) or a tissue-specific promoter in mice (11). Both approaches have limited 
applicability. Namely, heat-shock regulation of transgene expression is currently only useful in 
flies and no suitable counterpart is available for use in cell lines or vertebrates. Also, the use
