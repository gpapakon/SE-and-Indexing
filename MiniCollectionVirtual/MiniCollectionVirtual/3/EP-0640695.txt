<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a corrosion-resistant alloy to be used as a material for texturable parts which are in contact, at least in part, with the skin of living beings, in particular of humans, and do not trigger any hypersensitive reactions or allergies. For this purpose, according to the invention, an alloy is provided which essentially contains the elements, in per cent by weight carbon      max. 0.10                    silicon     max. 1.0 manganese   from 11.0 to 25.0                    chromium    from 10.0 to 20.0                    molybdenum  up to 1.0    nitrogen    from 0.05 to 0.55 the remainder being iron, with the proviso that the nickel content is below 0.5%, that the material, after a solutionising treatment, has been quenched and, if appropriate, cold-worked and has an austenitic microstructure.

<CLAIMS>
Use of a corrosion resistant alloy containing % by weight 

carbon
1.0 maximum 
silicon
1.0 maximum 
manganese
11.0 to 25.0 
chromium
10.0 to 20.0 
molybdenum
up to 1.6 
nitrogen
0.05 to 0.55, 
 
optionally one or several of the elements vanadium, niobium, tantalum, tungsten, 

aluminium, titanium, copper, and boron in a concentration of no more than 2.0 % by 
weight, and iron and fabrication-related impurities as the remainder, which alloy has a 

nickel content of less than 0.5 % by weight, when in a quenched state, from a 
temperature of 1010°C to 1080°C for solution heat treatment and optionally in a cold-worked 

state to increase the proof stress and strength of the material, as an austenitic 
material for structured parts of clothing and/or for pieces of jewellery and utensils which 

are at least partially in contact with the skin of living beings, in particular human beings. 
Use of an alloy according to Claim 1, containing substantially % by weight 

carbon
0.6 maximum 
manganese
18.0 to 21.5 
chromium
12.0 to 15.0 
nitrogen
0.2 to 0.4. 
Use of an alloy according to Claim 1 or 2 with a nickel content of no more than 0.25 % 
by weight. 
Use of an alloy according to any of Claims 1 to 3 with cold working of at least 5 %, 
preferably of greater than 15%. 
Use of an alloy according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 as a non-magnetic material for 
housings of watches and/or wristbands of watches.
