<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to thermoplastic molding compositions comprising the following: (a) 5 to 95 % by weight of a polyester or a polyester, comprising: repeat units derived from terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol, and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol wherein the mole ratio of ethylene glycol to 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol is from 66:34 to 98:2, said polyester having an I.V. of 0.3 dL/g to 1.2 dL/g, and (b) 5 to 95 % by weight of a polyphenylene ether. The compositions are useful for producing clear articles by injection molding or extrusion.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
polyester/polyphenylene ether blends. The blends
possess a balance of good appearance, mechanical
properties, processability, and economic feasibility.Polyesters based on terephthalic acid, ethylene
glycol and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol are useful for
producing clear articles by injection molding or
extrusion. For many applications, these materials have
sufficient thermal dimensional stability. However, for
other applications such as medical devices requiring
steam sterilization, there is a need for further
improvements in thermal dimensional stability. Some
improvements have occurred in this area. For example,
polyesters have been blended with polystyrene as
disclosed in United States Patent 3,644,574, assigned to
Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, New York. Polyesters
have also been blended with styrene-maleic anhydride
copolymers as disclosed in United States Patent
4,891,405, assigned to Arco Chemical Co.. Also,
polyesters have been blended with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene
polymers as disclosed in Modern
Plastics Encyclopedia published in 1990 by McGraw Hill,
Inc. However, blends containing significant quantities
of dissimilar polymers are typically opaque.Surprisingly, we have found that blends of certain
polyesters with polyphenylene oxide (or polyphenylene
ether) polymers exhibit marked clarity. Polyphenylene
ether polymers are clear and possess attractive thermal
dimensional stabilities, but they are difficult to
process and relatively expensive. These deficiencies
can be overcome by adding other polymers, such as high
impact polystyrene as disclosed in British Patent 
1,125,628 by R. W. Finholt, assigned to General Electric
Company, or polycarbonate as disclosed in United States
Patent 4,401,649, assigned to Borg-Warner Chemicals.
These compositions are generally opaque.Therefore, there is a continuing need in various
research and industrial arts for polyesters having good
thermal dimensional stability, clarity, ease in
processing, and economic feasibility.EP-A-0 530 648 discloses a blend of certain polyesters and
polymers that are miscible with polystyrene, such as
polyphenylene oxide. In particular, table XI discloses 1 : 1
polyphenylene ether/copolyester compositions in which the
copolyester is derived from terephthalic acid, ethylene glycol
and 1,4-cyclohexanedimethanol units (having a glycol ratio of
66 : 34). This document is not pre-published and thus relevant
only with regard to the designated contracting states Germany,
France and Great Britain,
