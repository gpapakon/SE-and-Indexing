<ABSTRACT>
Pivoting device for a rotor (2) of a motor (3), the said rotor (2) comprising, at its two ends, an end piece or ring, a front end piece or ring (36) and a rear end piece or ring (37) respectively, characterised in that the rotor is immersed in a liquid fluid contained in a chamber (43) while the diameter of each of the rings is slightly less than the diameter of the said chamber in the region of the said ring in such a way that, in rest position, the rotor is supported in the chamber by means of the end rings, while, in rotation, a film of fluid is created between the outer surfaces of the rings and the inner face of the chamber thus constituting a hydrodynamic bearing surface.
