ratio change/panoramic image pick-up mode by a 

multi-eye image pick-up apparatus, information is 
displayed such that a photographer can intuitively 

grasp various image pick-up conditions. 
A multi-eye image pick-up apparatus having a 
plurality of image pick-up optical systems includes an 

operation processing portion for receiving signals of 
position information obtained by an encoder and a 

rotational angle encoder provided to each image pick-up 
optical system, and a slide mechanism to calculate the 

image pick-up conditions and the display position of a 
figure representing the image pick-up state to be 

displayed in a finder, and a finder screen image 
producing portion for producing, from a calculation 

result, a video signal to be displayed in the finder.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to
a multi-eye image
pick-up apparatus such as a television or video camera
system which can pick up an image using a plurality of
image pick-up optical systems to provide a stereoscopic
image or an image having an arbitrary aspect ratio.A conventional method of informing a photographer
of the image pick-up state of cameras in a multi-eye
image pick-up system is disclosed in, e.g., Japanese
Patent Laid-Open Application No. 1086129. According
to this method, the convergence angle between the two
cameras of a stereoscopic image pick-up apparatus is
detected. When the convergence angle is inappropriate
to pick up a stereoscopic image, an alarm device
constituted by a buzzer or a lamp generates an alarm to
prevent a failure in the image pick-up operation.However, since the above-described prior art has
as its main object to inform whether or not the
convergence angle is appropriate to pick up a
stereoscopic image, it fails to provide sufficient
information as to the image pick-up state. In 
addition, the above prior art is directed to only the
stereoscopic image pick-up operation and does not refer
to informing of the image pick-up state in an aspect
ratio change/panoramic image pick-up mode. However, in
the aspect ratio change/panoramic image pick-up mode,
the aspect ratio is adjusted by controlling the
vergence. For this reason, a desired image can hardly
be obtained without determining the vergence state in
the image pick-up operation. In-focus and photometric
regions in the stereoscopic image pick-up mode and the
aspect ratio change/panoramic image pick-up mode must
also be displayed."Voice Control of Remote Stereoscopic Systems" by
M.L. Philips in IEEE Proceedings - 1990 Southeastcon '90,
vol 2 of 3, April 1990, New York, pages 594-598,
XP000203497 discloses a system in which a vehicle is
fitted with two cameras to provide a stereo vision
system. The display comprises dual monitors fitted with
polarizing fitters, and a 3-D effect is created by
combining two images from the two monitors in a beam
splitter. Each operator wears polarized glasses, such
that light from each monitor is seen by only one eye.
Graphic overlays are added to live video from the
cameras. The graphic overlays consist of icons for zoom,
focus, pan and tilt angles. In addition, any time two
objects are marked on the screen, the distance and angle 
between them is drawn on the screen.The present invention provides a multi-eye image
pickup apparatus as set out in claim 1.The present invention also provides
