<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing a Group III-V compound semiconductor
and to a Group III-V compound semiconductor. These
semiconductors
may be used for various semiconductor devices such as laser
diodes, light-emitting diodes and high electron-mobility
transistors.The following methods have been known for crystal
growth of the elements used for semiconductor devices:
(i) a crystal of C1IIIAsxP1-x (C1III: one or more Group III elements,
0 ≤ x < 0.5) is directly grown on A1IIIAswP1-w (A1III: one or more Group
III elements with an Al content of less than 0.3, 0.5 < w ≤
1) formed on a semiconductor crystal substrate or on an
epitaxial film grown on said substrate; and (ii) a
crystal of A2IIIAsuP1-u (A2III: one or more Group III elements with an In content
of not less than 0.3, 0 ≤ u ≤ 1) is grown on a
semiconductor crystal substrate or on an epitaxial film
grown on said substrate, and after an interruption of
crystal growth in which a heating step is required, 
a C2IIIAszP1-z crystal (C2III: one or more Group III elements, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1) is
grown directly on the A2IIIAsuP1-u.For crystal growth of (AlyGa1-y)0.5In0.5P (0 ≤ y ≤ 1),
which is a material used in visible laser diodes or visible
light emitting diodes, a GaAs buffer layer is generally
grown on a GaAs substrate and the crystal material is
directly grown on the GaAs buffer layer by a MOVPE (metal
organic vapor phase epitaxy) technique.However, the direct growth of a (AlyGa1-y)0.5In0.5P
crystal on the GaAs buffer layer formed on a
GaAs substrate involves problems in that substitution takes
place between the As in the GaAs crystal and the P in the vapor
phase causing interfacial defects, thereby making it impossible
to obtain an AlGaInP crystal with a good quality.
Especially in the growth of an AlGaInP crystal with a high Al
content, it is vital to carry out the crystal growth at
a high temperature (not less than 700°C) for preventing
contamination of the crystal with oxygen, to reduce the
influence of the interfacial defects due to substitution
between the As in the GaAs crystal and the P in the vapor phase.Growth of the GaAs buffer layer on a
semiconductor substrate is preferably carried out at a low
temperature of less than 700°C for minimizing diffusion of
impurities from the substrate crystal into the epitaxial
crystal layer. Further, if the buffer layer of
A2IIIAsuP1-u 
has a high In content, when the
crystal growth is carried out at a high temperature
a large quantity of In has to be supplied since the
efficiency of In
