<ABSTRACT>
In the present invention, by using a thermoplastic 
norbornene type plastic as a material for the magnetic disc 

substrate, a magnetic disc substrate having a small 
deformation and a high modulus of elasticity can be prepared. 

Furthermore, in the present invention, by optimizing the 
thickness of the substrate, the resonance frequency of the 

magnetic disc can be elevated to a level higher than the servo 
band. As a result, a magnetic disc substrate which applies 

the present invention can form a servo mark having a high 
positional precision, and can carry out the tracking at high 

precision.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic disc substrate
which uses a thermoplastic norbornene resin. More particularly,
the present invention relates to a magnetic disc which can
conduct the position control of the magnetic head with high
accuracy.In a magnetic recording medium which records and regenerates
digital information by a magnetic head, for example, a magnetic
disc, a servo mark is written to make the magnetic head follow
the recording track and to give an address information. In order
to carry out a tracking of the magnetic head with high accuracy
(hereinafter to control the position so as to follow the record
track precisely in a predetermined address is referred to as
"tracking"), it is required to elevate the resonance frequency
of the magnetic disc to higher than the servo band. Therefore,
materials having high modulus of elasticity, such as alumina, glass
or ceramics, have been used as a magnetic disc substrate. At the
time of recording the data, it has also been carried out to write
a position signal to the magnetic disc by writing a servo mark
simultaneously by a servo writer. However, as the width of the recording track is becoming
narrower as the density of records becoming high, high positional
precision of said position signals becomes necessary. And in the
conventional writing method of the position signal, it becomes
necessary to maintain high positional precision between the servo
writer and the mechanism portion of the magnetic recording
device. And there is a problem that since it requires extremely
difficult technology, the device becomes expensive.Therefore, a method has been proposed that the positional
precision of the position signal is increased by preforming a
servo mark in the magnetic disc. For example, there can be
mentioned a method in which a servo mark is formed by etching or
by non-magnetizing the magnetic layer, or a method in which a
magnetic disc substrate is molded by a molding technique and the
like, and at the time of molding, an uneven servo mark is formed.However, in said method to form a servo mark by etching or
non-magnetizing a magnetic layer, there is a defect in that the
production process of the magnetic disc becomes complicated to
make the industrial production difficult.On the other hand, a method to form an uneven servo mark by
molding a magnetic disc substrate by a molding technique is
excellent in the productivity and industrially advantageous.
However, if the plastic used as a substrate is a polycarbonate,
a polymethylmethacrylate and the
