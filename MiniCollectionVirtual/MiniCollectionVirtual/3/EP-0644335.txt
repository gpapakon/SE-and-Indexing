<ABSTRACT>
When a control lever (8) is operated to leftward under 
a heavy load, a pressure sensor (11) detects a pressure to a 

direction switching valve (1), pressure sensors (9, 10) detect 
pressures on upstream and downstream and sides of a throttle 

valve (4), and an inclination angle sensor (15) and a revolution 
counter (16) detect an inclination angle of a swash plate and the 

number of revolutions of a pump (2), the detected pressures, 
angle and rotations being input to a controller (12). A target 

flow rate setting unit for lifting of a boom determines a target 
flow rate for lifting of a boom on the basis of signals from 

the pressure sensor (11) and the revolution counter (16), a 
detecting unit of a discharge flow rate of a pump determines a 

discharge flow rate of a pump on the basis of signals from the 
inclination angle sensor (15) and the revolution counter (16), 

and a differential pressure detecting unit and a center bypass 
flow rate computing unit determine a center bypass flow rate 

on the basis of signals from the pressure sensors (9, 10). A 
computing unit of a flow rate for a boom cylinder determines 

a flow rate for a boom cylinder on the basis of a discharge 
flow rate of a pump and a center bypass flow rate, and a first 

computing unit of a target displacement of a pump calculates a 
first target inclination angle ϑ₁ of a pump based on a differential 

flow rate between a target flow rate for lifting of a boom 
and a flow rate for a boom cylinder. At this time, the first 

target inclination angle ϑ₁ becomes larger than a second target 
inclination angle ϑ₂ of a pump for negative control to be selected 

by a maximum value selecting unit, and a smaller one of the 
first target inclination angle ϑ₁ and a maximum inclination angle 

ϑ
max
 by horse power control is selected by a minimum value 
selecting unit, so that a corresponding target electric current is 

output to a solenoid proportional valve (13) from a drive signal 
generating unit to cause a piston (6a) of a regulator (6) to be 

driven to rightward in Fig. 4. Accordingly, a flow rate of a hydraulic pump (2) is gradually increased whereby a 
constantly favorable metering characteristics is obtained irrespective of magnitute of load.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a hydraulic drive
system for hydraulic working machines such as hydraulic
excavators, and more particularly to a hydraulic drive
system for hydraulic working machines which has a directional
control valve of center bypass type.Conventionally known hydraulic drive systems of the
above-described type are described in, for example, JP, B,
47-3927 and JP, B, 50-5354. Each of these known hydraulic
drive systems comprises a variable displacement hydraulic
pump, at least one actuator driven by a hydraulic fluid
delivered from the hydraulic pump, a directional control
valve of center bypass type having a meter-in passage provided
with a meter-in variable restrictor and a center
bypass passage provided with a bleed-off variable restrictor
for controlling a flow of the hydraulic fluid supplied
from the hydraulic pump to the actuator, a low pressure
circuit, a center bypass line for connecting the center
bypass passage to the low pressure circuit at a point
downstream of the bleed-off variable restrictor, a pressure 
generator, e.g., a fixed restrictor, disposed in the center
bypass line, and a pump regulator for controlling a displacement
volume of the hydraulic pump using the pressure
generated by the fixed restrictor as a control pressure.The pump regulator performs well-known negative control
based on the control pressure generated by the fixed
restrictor. More specifically, the pump regulator controls
a displacement volume of the hydraulic pump so that the
displacement volume increases as the control pressure is
lowered, and it decreases as the control pressure is
raised.In the prior art arranged as above, when the directional
control valve is gradually shifted from a neutral
position through its stroke with the intention of driving
the actuator, an opening area of the bleed-off variable
restrictor of the directional control valve is gradually
reduced and, to the contrary, an opening area of the meter-in
variable restrictor thereof is gradually increased.When the directional control valve is in the neutral
position or at the start point of the stroke thereof, i.e.,
when the bleed-off variable restrictor begins to close, the
control pressure generated by the fixed restrictor is high
and the hydraulic pump is kept at a predetermined small
displacement volume to deliver the hydraulic fluid at a
standby flow rate which is small corresponding to the
predetermined small displacement volume. Then, as the
bleed-off variable restrictor is gradually closed, a pressure
of the hydraulic
