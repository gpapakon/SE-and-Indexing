<ABSTRACT>
Before being put into service, the drives are subjected in repeated cycles (I;II etc.) to a loading process in each case comprising a first loading (M1) simulating operation of the sintered bearings in the mixed-friction range (MR) and a subsequent transition to a second loading (MA) simulating operation of the sintered bearings in the boundary-friction range (GR).

Process for improving the run-in characteristics 
of drives having sintered bearings, in particular of 

geared motors for window-lifter or sliding-roof drives in 
motor vehicles, characterized in that: 


a) The drives are subjected, prior to their operational 
usage in repeated cycles (I;II etc.), to a loading 

procedure exhibiting respectively a first load (M₁), 
with the effect of operation of the sintered 

bearings in the mixed friction region (MR), and a 
subsequent transition to a second load (M
A
), with 
the effect of operation of the sintered bearings in 

the boundary friction region (GR). 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that: 


b) The first load (M₁) lies closely below the transition 
(n
ü
) between the mixed friction region (MR), on 
the one hand, and the fluid friction region (FR) on 

the other hand. 
Process according to Claim 1 and/or 2, characterized 
in that: 


c) The second load (M
A
) lies in the region of the 
standstill, and hence of the starting torque of the 

drive. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1-3, 
characterized in that: 


d) The increase in the load torque between the first 
load (M₁) and the second load (M
A
) is realized with 
the effect of minimal energy consumption of the 

drive, in particular the electrical energy consumption 
(I·U) of an electric geared motor. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that: 


e) The transition from the first load (M₁) to the 
second load (M
A
) is realized according to a parabolic 
transition function of the load torque. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1-4, 
characterized in that: 


f) The transition from the first load (M₁) to the 
second load (M
A
) is realized according to a hyperbolic 
transition function of the load torque. 
Process according to at least one of Claims 1-6, 
characterized in that: 


g) Between the individual cycles, load intervals are 
provided.
