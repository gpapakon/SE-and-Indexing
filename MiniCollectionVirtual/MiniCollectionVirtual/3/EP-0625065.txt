<ABSTRACT>
A mobile installation for sludge processing by means of a chamber filter press (1) in the form of a diaphragm press also comprises a feed system (9) to produce the heavy-liquid and various units to vary the temperature and pressure inside the press (1), e.g. a hot-steam unit (22), a hot-air unit (32) and a vacuum unit (40) which can be connected to the interior via switching or controllable valves. The installation is especially suitable for the production of pourable and pelletted substances, e.g. paints, soups and beverage powders, vegetable and fruit snacks and various pharmaceuticals and for the processing of slurry by filtering followed by drying or freeze-drying the filter cake in the chamber filter press (1).
