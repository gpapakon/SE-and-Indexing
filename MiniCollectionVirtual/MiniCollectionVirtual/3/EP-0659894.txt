<ABSTRACT>
A high-modulus iron-based alloy containing at least one 
boride dispersed in an iron or iron-alloy matrix. The 

boride may be one of a Group IVa element, or a complex 
boride of at least one Group Va element and iron. A mixture 

of an iron or iron-alloy powder and a powder of at least one 
boride containing a Group IVa or Va element is compacted and 

sintered to make a shaped high-modulus iron-based alloy 
product.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a high-modulus iron-based
alloy and a process for manufacturing the same. More
particularly, it relates to an iron-based alloy which has a
high Young's or specific Young's modulus and is useful as a
high-modulus structural metallic material, and a process for
manufacturing the same.Steels or iron alloys are used more widely than any
other structural metallic materials. The addition of an
alloying element or elements to these metallic materials and
the effective heat treatment thereof promote a very broad
microstructural change and thereby provide the diversity in
their mechanical properties, such as strength and toughness.
However, it has been regarded difficult to achieve a drastic
improvement in the modulus despite of the importance in
designing any structural part, since the modulus directly
depends on the binding force of constituent atoms.While there have not been reported many cases of
research efforts made to improve the modulus of steel or an 
iron alloy, there has long been known a method which relies
upon the texture of marked steel for high Young's modulus in
a specific direction alone [see e.g. J. L. Lytton: J. of
Applied Physics, 35-8 (1964), 2397]. The application of the
method is, however, limited only to thin sheet and not to
any bulky material.A great deal of research and development work has been
made in the field of a composite material which comprises a
matrix of a lightweight metal, such as a magnesium, aluminum
or titanium alloy, and reinforcing fibers or particles
employed for increasing the strength or modulus of the
material. In fact, a composite material made by dispersing
high-modulus particles in a lightweight metal matrix
provides a high-modulus bulky material.The above concept employed for improving the modulus of
a lightweight alloy is, however, difficult to apply to steel
or an iron alloy. Only some carbides and nitrides are in
thermodynamic equilibrium with iron alloys, and no drastic
improvement in Young's modulus can be expected in the
dispersion of any such particles. It has been usual to
precipitate carbides of molybdenum, vanadium, chromium,
tungsten or the like in steels, particularly tool steels,
mainly for improving their wear resistance. However, these
carbides, expressed by chemical formulas such as MC, M3C,
M6C, M7C3 and M23C6, dissolve a large amount of iron and 
fail to contribute to any high Young's modulus of the
alloys.Some borides of transition elements show relatively
high Young's modulus, but there has hardly been reported
