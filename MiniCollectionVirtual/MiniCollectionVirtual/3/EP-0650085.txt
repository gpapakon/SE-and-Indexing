<ABSTRACT>
Tabular grain emulsions are disclosed in 
which the tabular grains have average thicknesses of 

less than 0.07 µm and average equivalent circular 
diameters of at least 0.7 µm. These ultrathin tabular 

grain emulsions are improved by the incorporation of at 
least 0.4 mole percent chloride along with 
>
50 mole 
percent bromide and, optionally, iodide. Greater than 

97 percent of total grain projected area can be 
accounted for by the tabular grains. The emulsions 

exhibit reduced pressure sensitivity, exhibit increased 
developability and exhibit reduced native sensitivity 

to the blue region of the spectrum.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is directed to improved tabular
grain photographic emulsions.Figure 1 is a plot of pAg versus temperature
in degrees Celsius. Curves A and B also appear in
Piggin et al U.S. Patent 5,061,609 and 5,061,616.In referring to silver halide grains containing
two or more halides, the halides are named in their
order of increasing concentration. Halide ion concentrations
are stated in mole percent, based on silver,
where the silver is the total silver forming the tabular
grain structure, unless otherwise stated.The term "tabular grain emulsion" is employed
herein to designate emulsions in which at least 50
percent of total grain projected area is accounted for
by tabular grains. Tabular grains are those grains
which have two parallel major crystal faces that are
significantly larger than any remaining grain face.A variety of photographic advantages have
been recognized to be realizable employing tabular
grain emulsions. These advantages include, but are not
limited to, improved speed-granularity relationships,
increased image sharpness, a capability for more rapid
processing, increased covering power, reduced covering
power loss at higher levels of forehardening, higher
gamma for a given level of grain size dispersity, less
image variance as a function of processing time and/or
temperature variances, higher separations of blue and
minus blue speeds, the capability of optimizing light
transmission or reflection as a function of grain
thickness and reduced susceptibility to background
radiation damage in very high speed emulsions. Initially interest in tabular grain emulsions
focused on high aspect ratio tabular grain emulsions,
those in which the average aspect ratio of the tabular
grains is greater than 8. Aspect ratio is defined by
the relationship:
ECD/t
where
ECD is the equivalent circular diameter of a tabular
grain andt is thickness of the tabular grain, both ECD and
t being expressed in the same units, typically micrometers
(µm). Subsequently it was realized that tabular
grain emulsions with at least moderate (≥5) average
aspect ratios are also superior for many applications,
provided the average thickness of the tabular grains is
not high, typically less than 0.2 µm.Ultrathin tabular grain emulsions, those in
which the average thickness of the tabular grains
accounting for at least 50 percent of total grain
projected area is less than 0.07 µm, have been reported
in a few instances. Daubendiek et al U.S. Patents
