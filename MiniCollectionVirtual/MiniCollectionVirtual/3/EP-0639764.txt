<ABSTRACT>
Improved systems for optical inspection are provided. The 
improved systems use modified camera boxes (10) to provide 

increased, and more uniform, illumination of the objects being 
inspected through the use of illuminator windows. The lens 

arrangement of the improved camera boxes is contained within a 
self-contained, sealed housing (12) that is separate from the 

camera to prevent particle contamination of the lens arrangement 
and provide improved flexibility during installation of the camera 

boxes on the inspection systems. 
Illumination light is transmitted along fibres (62), into illuminator 
(44) and through windows (50), which act as waveguides, and exit as 

light rays (64). The reflected image, in the form of light rays (66) is 
captured by mirrors (48) and reflected through windows (50) to prism 

(36). Prism (36) takes each subimage and directs it to a central focal 
point, which may occur at a folding mirror (52) or on the camera lens 

directly.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to systems for optical
inspection. More particularly, this invention relates to camera
boxes used in systems for optically inspection cylindrical
surfaces such as the cylindrical surfaces of cigarettes.Systems for originally inspection cylindrical surfaces
are described in the applicants earlier application EP-A-0570163.
That application describes optical inspection systems that operate
by first inspecting at least 180° of the circumference of a first
side, and then inspecting at least 180° of the circumference of
the other side. The inspection systems illuminate more than 180°
of the circumference of the object by utilizing two, angularly
spaced, light sources. Images of the illuminated object are then
formed (using camera boxes and computer processors), which images
are analyzed using various techniques to make possible the
detection of very small defects, as well as to compensate for
possible nonuniform illumination of the objects in the
circumferential direction.A possible disadvantage of the camera boxes
of the above-incorporated patent application is the
large size required, due to the fact that the camera
boxes contain a conventional video camera, two lights
sources, and a series of apertures and reflectors which
are used to form the image. A further possible
disadvantage of the camera boxes is the system
installation limitation due to the straight in-line
nature of the conventional video camera. These
disadvantages may result in requiring extra
intermediate drums to provide adequate installation
space for the camera boxes, in addition to the overall
increased space requirements of the inspection system
itself.Another possible disadvantage of the camera
boxes of the above-incorporated application is the fact
that the camera boxes are not sealed units. The
aperture design of the camera boxes is such that it may
permit particle contamination of the optics, and the 
camera itself, to occur. Such contamination may occur
due to the nature of the manufacturing operation (e.g.,
production rates approaching 10,000 cigarettes a minute
may cause loose tobacco fibers and other contaminants
to be introduced into the manufacturing environment).A further possible disadvantage of the camera
boxes of the above-incorporated application is the
ability to sufficiently illuminate the object during
inspection. The inspection system may utilize
additional image processing techniques to compensate
for possible nonuniform illumination of the objects in
the circumferential direction and the
