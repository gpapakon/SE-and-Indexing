<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus (G) for producing soldered multi-layer metal tubes (10) has a rolling device (A-E) with several forming-roller pairs (21, 21; 24, 25) for the gradual plastic forming of a flat metal strip (11) into a slit tube (at 17) and then into an at first unsoldered, multi-layer tubular body (RK). The multi-layer tubular body (RK) passes through electric feeder points (P1, P2) of a conductive heating zone (Z). The electric feeder points (P1, P2) have contact rollers (24, 25; 28, 29) arranged at an axial distance from one another. The conductive heating zone (Z) has a preheating zone (ZV) and an annealing zone (ZG) following downstream. A cooling section (at 32) follows the annealing zone (ZG). A forming-roller pair (24, 25) enclosing the unsoldered, multi-layer tubular body (RK) at the same time forms the first contact-roller pair arranged upstream, which represents a first electric feeder point (P1) at the start of the heating zone (Z). A second contact-roller pair (28, 29) arranged downstream of the first contact-roller pair (24, 25) forms the second electric feeder point (P2) as well as the end of the heating zone (Z) and is provided with a separate drive for a greater circumferential speed than that of the first contact-roller pair (24, 25). The tube-conveying device (F) arranged downstream behind the cooling section (at 32) can be adjusted as a function of the tube-feed rate prevailing in the area of the second contact-roller pair (28, 29).

Apparatus for manufacturing soldered multilayer metal
pipes (10), with a rolling apparatus comprising several pairs of

grooved rolls for the step-wise plastic forming of a level
strip-type metal band (11) on the way via a slotted pipe to an

initially unsoldered multilayer pipe body, which incorporates
in a cross-sectional plane of the pair of grooved rolls

encompassing it a calibrating mandrel, the so-called float (22),
which, facing downstream in relation to the direction of

advance of the pipe, is secured at the free end of a drag link (23)
held three-dimensionally stable and drawn out of the slotted

pipe, and with electric feed points, comprising contact rolls
disposed at an axial distance from one another, of a

conductive heating zone which comprises a pre-heating zone (ZV) and
an incandescent zone (ZG) adjoining the latter downstream and

followed by a cooling zone (32) and, adjoining the latter, a pipe
conveying apparatus (F), 
characterised in that
 the pair of grooved
rolls (24, 25) which encompass the unsoldered multilayer pipe

body (RK) and also the float (22) form simultaneously the
first pair of contact rolls disposed upstream with the first

electric feed point (P1) representing the start of the heating
zone (Z), that a second pair of contact rolls (28, 29)

disposed downstream in relation to the first pair of contact
rolls (24, 25), which form the second electric feed point (P2)

and simultaneously the end of the heating zone (Z), are
provided with their own drive (45) and exhibit a greater

peripheral speed than the first pair of contact rolls (24, 25)

(F) is adjustable as a function of the rate of advance of the
pipe occurring in the vicinity of the second pair of contact

rolls (28, 29).
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

there is provided at a common distance between the first pair
of contact rolls (24, 25) and the second pair of contact rolls
