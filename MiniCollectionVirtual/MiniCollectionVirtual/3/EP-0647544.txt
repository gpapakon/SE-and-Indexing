<ABSTRACT>
A cover construction for use on a box (4) having rigid walls 
(6,7), in 

particular suitable for use in a folding caravan. The cover 
construction comprises a rigid panel (11) having, along the 

circumferential edges thereof, flexible, edge strips (12), 
which in the operating condition hang on the outside along the 

walls (6,7) of the box (4) and are provided, 
along the free edges thereof, 

with fastening means for detachable fastening to the outside of 
the box (4).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cover construction for use on a
box having rigid sidewalls, in particular suitable for use in a
folding caravan, as known e.g. from GB-A-457 169 or GB-A-926 222.A folding caravan, often referred to as folding trailer,
comprises a chassis having wheels, carrying, in the folded-up
condition of the folding caravan, a box provided with a cover.
Normally, the box has rigid walls and the cover is supported by
the top edge of the walls.It is observed that within the scope of the present
application, by rigid walls are also meant walls consisting of a
rigid frame covered with cloth or the like, i.e. walls having a
form-retaining contour form or at least a rigid top edge. Such
walls are for instance described in Dutch patent application
9101928 to applicant.Folding trailers having a cover of rigid, hard material are
known. A great advantage of using such a hard cover is that it
can be used for mounting a luggage carrier (roofrack). This
possibility is often used for mounting bicycle carriers.However, a drawback of the use of a hard cover is that it is
very difficult to construct a hard cover so that it provides a
watertight sealing on the sidewalls under all circumstances which
may occur during travel and also during garaging. During a shower
of rain whilst touring, water will not only hit the folding
trailer from above, but spurting water will also hit the folding
trailer in an inclined upward direction. Further, practically
horizontal trails of water will be formed due to (travel) wind.
In addition, the sealing can be influenced by suction forces
generated by (travel) wind, as a result of which the
waterproofness may be lost. It is of major importance that the
cover forms a waterproof sealing on the box, because even a small 
amount of moisture in the folding trailer box will be sufficient
for causing damage to the cloth of the folding caravan in the
long run. The material of the cover should further be resistant
to all weather influences: it must not discolor, go brittle, take
up moisture, buckle, etc.Hence, very high requirements are made of a hard cover, with
regard to both the quality of the material used and the
waterproofness of the sealing on the box. As a result, the
construction with a hard cover is relatively costly.The problems involved in the use of a hard cover can be
avoided by covering the top side of the box of a folding trailer
with a tarpaulin. A tarpaulin can be pulled over the sidewalls of
the box for a considerable distance and secured by means of, for
instance,
