<ABSTRACT>
A select line scanner for a liquid crystal display 
includes a plurality of cascaded stages each having an input 

terminal and an output terminal. Each stage includes a clocked 
output circuit including serially connected pull up and pull down 

transistors. A further transistor has its conduction path coupled 
between the control electrode of the pull up transistor 

and a point of potential of sufficient value to turn the pull up 
transistor off. The control electrode of the further transistor is 

coupled to an output of a succeeding one of the cascaded stages 
or, alternatively to a source of clocking signals of a phase differing 

from the clock phase applied to said output circuit, to insure that 
the output of the respective stage cannot drift to an on state.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to shift registers and
particularly to a shift register stage useful as a select line scanner
for liquid crystal displays.Liquid crystal television and computer displays (LCDs)
are known in the art. For example, see U.S. patents 4,742,346 and
4,766,430, both issued to G.G. Gillette et al. Displays of the type
described in the Gillette patents include a matrix of liquid crystal
cells which are arranged at the crossovers of data lines and select
lines. The select lines are sequentially selected by a select line
scanner to produce the horizontal lines of the display. The data
lines apply the brightness (gray scale) signals to the columns of
liquid crystal cells as the select lines are sequentially selected.Preferably, the drive circuitry, which drives the select
line scanner, which selects the horizontal lines to be displayed, is
fabricated directly onto the same substrate and at the same time
as the liquid crystal cells are fabricated. Also, because a large
number of data lines and select lines are required for a television
or computer display, and because the small pixel pitch limits the
space available for laying out the driver circuitry, it is essential to
keep the circuitry as simple as possible.FIGURE 1 illustrates an example of a known scan
register described in U.S. Patent No. 5,222,082, which may be
integrated with a liquid crystal display device. This register is
driven with multiphase clocking signals C1, C2, C3, with different
ones of the clock phases applied to different ones of the scan
register stages 11.Figure 2 illustrates one of the scan register stages in
detail. The scan register stage includes an input section including
transistors 18 and 19 , an intermediate section including
transistors 20 and 21 and an output section including transistors
16 and 17.The output section is arranged as a push-pull
amplifier, with a clocked supply potential connected to its supply
connection 14. An output is accessed at the interconnection of the
transistors 16 and 17. The input section is arranged as a switched amplifier
to exhibit a predetermined potential during the clock phase
applied to the supply terminal of the output section. The output
signal, P1, of the input stage, is coupled to drive the output
transistor 16. More particularly the output, P1, follows the input
signal applied to the gate electrode of transistor 18. The output of
the input section will be high when the clock phase applied to
terminal 14 goes high, and a high level is translated to the output
term
