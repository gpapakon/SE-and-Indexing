<ABSTRACT>
The vessel comprises bottom (1), sidewalls (2) and lid (3), also an inner lid (10) resting on the contents. The main lid (3) is removable and allows air to flow into the space above the inner lid, which is thrust downwards by a compression spring (12). A lip seal (11) on the inner lid works against the sidewalls (2). The outlet system (6) is airtight and incorporated in the bottom. The seal can be integral with the inner lid. The outlet system can include a metering chamber (7), and a pneumatic or hydraulic ram can be used in place of the spring.
