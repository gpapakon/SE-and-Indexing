<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process for obtaining 
emulsions of the core/shell type having a low fog level. 
The process consists of precipitating, by the 
double jet method, a photographic emulsion comprising 

core-shell silver halide grains, the concentrations of 
halides varying progressively during at least the 

formation of the core. 
Application to reversal or negative photographic 
products is disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a process for
preparing a photographic emulsion, in particular an
emulsion consisting of silver halide grains inherently
having a low fog level. These emulsions of the negative
or reversal type may be used in color photographic
products.As is explained in T. H. James, The Theory of
the Photographic Process, 4th Edition, published by
Macmillan, pages 393-394, fog forms in the areas which
are not exposed to light under the non-selective action
of the developer. Fog may be defined as the density
obtained in the parts which have not been exposed to
light. Fog may be due to the nature of the emulsion, to
the developing, to oxidation by air or to aging.It is known that fog may be promoted by an
increase in sensitivity and it is essential therefore
that a reduction in the level of fog does not take place
at the cost of a loss of sensitivity.Normally anti-fogging agents are used to reduce
or eliminate the formation of fog. In particular mineral
anti-fogging agents such as mercury II salts have been
used. For example, European patent 0 352 618 describes
the use of a combination comprising a mercury oxide or
salt and a benzothiazolium compound for exerting a
stabilizing and anti-fogging action.These mercury derivatives have drawbacks with
regard to the environment. Organic compounds or their
salts are also used as anti-fogging or stabilizing
agents. For example, US patent 2 694 716 describes the
use of salts of polymethylene-bis-benzothiazolium as 
anti-fogging agents in photographic emulsions. These
compounds are not as effective as mercury salts.Thus the problem of the fog of emulsions is not
always satisfactorily resolved and it would be very
desirable to be able to have emulsions with
characteristics such that the presence of anti-fogging
agents would be superfluous.The aim of the present invention is a process
for obtaining an emulsion of the core/shell type having a
low fog level when the emulsion has just been prepared or
after aging, an emulsion which also has a good compromise
between fog and sensitivity. Core/shell emulsion is
taken to mean an emulsion in which the silver halides are
distributed non-uniformly within the grain. A
conventional method for preparing such emulsions consists
of forming grains with a multilayer structure by
successively precipitating regions with different halide
compositions. The central region is normally referred to
as the core and the other regions are grouped together
under the name shell.Many patents of the prior art describe
bromoiodide

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing a photographic
emulsion comprising silver halide grains with a core/shell

structure, in which successive regions having different
silver halide compositions are precipitated by introducing

simultaneously a solution of a silver salt and a solution
of an alkaline metal halide or halides,


wherein, during the precipitation of the core,
the halide solution contains iodide and at least one of

chloride and bromide, the concentration of iodide in the
halide solution varying progressively between an initial

maximum value and a final value of zero, and
during the precipitation of the shell, the halide solution

contains at least one of chloride and bromide and no
iodide.
A process according to Claim 1, in which the
iodide concentration varies between an initial value which

is between 10 and 40% molar of the total halides in the
halide solution and a final value which is zero.
A process according to Claim 2 in which the
initial value of the iodide concentration is approximately

36% molar of the total halides in the halide solution.
A light-sensitive emulsion comprised of
grains containing a core and a surrounding shell, wherein

the core contains iodide and at least one of chloride and
bromide, the content of iodide in the core varying

progressively from a maximum at the center of the grain to 
a value of zero adjacent the surrounding shell, and the

iodide content in the shell is zero.
A light-sensitive emulsion according to
claim 4 in which the grains are selected from among

tabular, octahedral, cubo-octahedral and cubic silver
halide grains.
A light-sensitive emulsion according to Claim 5
in which the grains are comprised of cubo-octahedral

silver halide grains.
A light-sensitive emulsion according to Claim
4 in which the grain core is comprised of silver

bromoiodide, chloroiodide, chlorobromoiodide,
bromochloride, chlorobromide, bromochloroiodide,

bromoiodochloride, or chloroiodobromide.
A light-sensitive emulsion according to claim
7 in which the grains are comprised of a core of silver

bromoiodide surrounded by a silver bromide shell.
A light-sensitive emulsion according to
Claim 8 in which the core to shell molar ratio of silver

A light-sensitive emulsion according to
Claim 9 in which the core to shell molar ratio of silver

is 0.5.
A light-sensitive emulsion according to
Claim 9 in which the total silver iodide concentration in

the silver halide grain is between 1 and 10% molar.
A light-sensitive emulsion according to any
of Claims 4-10 in which the silver iodide concentration in

the core ranges from 0.1 to 36 mole percent, based on the
silver in the core. 
A light-sensitive emulsion according to
Claim 4 in which the grains have a mean grain size of

between 0.3 and 2 µm.
Light-sensitive emulsion according to Claim
13 in which the grains have a mean size of between 0.4 and

1.6 µm.

Claim 16, which is of the negative type.
