<ABSTRACT>
In the case of a multi-speed bicycle hub (10) with a planet gear (12) having at least two multi-stage planet wheels (16), it is proposed that the planet wheels each be of two-part design, with a first planet-wheel part (70) having with a toothed rolling-contact portion (74a) which forms one planet-wheel stage (16c), and a toothed coupling portion which has teeth (76) on the outer circumference of the coupling, and with a second planet-wheel part (80) having at least one toothed rolling-contact portion, which in each case forms a planet-wheel stage (16a; 16b), and having a receiving opening (82) for the toothed coupling portion of the first planet-wheel part (70), which receiving opening is provided with teeth (78) on the inner circumference of the coupling, which teeth engage in the teeth (76) on the outer circumference of the coupling. The second planet-wheel part is formed from a sintered part and the first planet-wheel part from a milled part, the teeth on the outer circumference of the coupling being of the same number and having the same toothed ring orientation as the teeth on the inner circumference of the coupling. In this manner, precisely specified, mutual orientation of the planet-wheel stages is obtained whilst production costs are kept low.
