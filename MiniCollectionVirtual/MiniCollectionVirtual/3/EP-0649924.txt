<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a yarn-severing device 1 of a ring-spinning or ring-twisting spindle, with a frustoconical yarn-severing knife 5 which has, at its lower edge, a cutter 8 formed as a result of the grinding of the outer face 7 only. The ground face of the cutter 8 is located in a cylinder envelope 9, the opening angle  alpha  of the yarn-severing knife 5 being 20 DEG  to 30 DEG .

<CLAIMS>
Thread-separating device of a ring spinning or 
ring twisting spindle, with a thread-separating knife (5) 

which is in the form of a truncated cone envelope and 
which has at its lower edge a cutter formed by the 

grinding of the outside only, characterized in that the 
ground surface (7) of the cutter (8) lies in a cylinder 

envelope (9), and in that the aperture angle (α) of the 
thread-separating knife (5) is 20° to 30°. 
Thread-separating device according to Claim 1, in 
which the thread-separating knife has a bearing region 

capable of being placed onto a spindle and, under the 
said bearing region, the truncated cone region, characterized 

in that the bearing region (10) is designed as a 
plate plane which is arranged at right angles to the 

spindle longitudinal axis (A-A) and is provided with an 
orifice (11) for receiving the spindle (2) and the outer 

circumference of which the truncated cone region (12) 
adjoins. 
Thread-separating device according to Claim 2, 
characterized in that spacers for adjacent thread-separating 

knives (5, 5') consisting of sheet steel are formed 
in the bearing region (10). 
Arrangement of a plurality of thread-separating 
knives according to one of the preceding claims to form 

a disc stack (S), in which part of the inner wall (13) of 
the truncated cone region (12) of one thread-separating 

knife (5) rests on the outer wall (14) of the truncated 
cone region (12) of the adjacent thread-separating knife 

(5) and the bearing regions of the thread-separating  
 

knives (5, 5') are located at a distance from one another 
via the spacers. 
Thread-separating device according to Claim 3 or 
4, characterized in that the spacers (15, 16, 18) are 

designed as bosses (15, 15') arranged in the bearing 
region (10), and in that the bosses of adjacent thread-separating 

knives (5, 5') are offset relative to one 
another. 
Thread-separating device according to Claim 3 or 
4, characterized in that the spacers are designed as 

noses (16) which are arranged in the region of the 
orifice (11) and which are supported on surfaces (17, 

17') of the adjacent thread-separating knife. 
Thread-separating device according to Claim 4, 
characterized in that the spacers are designed as independent 

spacer rings (18) resting on the bearing region 
(10) of the thread-separating knife (5, 5'). 
Thread-separating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized in that, as a result of 

the height of the spacers, the thread-separating knives 
(5, 5') combined to form a disc stack (S) touch one 

another only in a part area of the truncated cone region 
(12). 
Thread-separating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by V-grooves on the 

circumference of the truncated cone region (12). 
Thread-separating device according to one of the 
preceding claims, characterized by a cylindrical grinding 

over of the outer edge of the conical disc stack (S) in 
the truncated cone region (12) in order to produce the 

cutter (8).
