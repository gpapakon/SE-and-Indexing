<ABSTRACT>
This invention is directed to a method for preparing 
glass sheet having surfaces which are essentially defect-free 

and equivalent in smoothness to polished glass 
surfaces. 
A laminated sheet is from molten batches of two 
glasses, the second glass being much more soluble in acid 

solution than the first one, and acid dissolving the second 
glass.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the fabrication of glass 
sheet prepared from glasses exhibiting high strain points 
for use in applications requiring glass sheet of precision 
flatness and exhibiting defect-free surfaces. One 
particular application for this invention is the production 
of glass substrates for use in liquid crystal display (LCD) 
devices, see U. S. Patent No. 5,116,787, for which glass is 
chosen as a substrate because first, it is transparent; 
second, it can withstand the chemical and physical 
(including thermal) conditions to which it is exposed 
during display processing; and, third, it can be produced 
at reasonable cost in thin sheets with precisely controlled 
dimensions. Intrinsically addressed liquid crystal displays are 
fabricated at relatively low temperatures, viz., ≦350°C. 
Accordingly, soda lime silicate glass sheet having a silica 
barrier layer thereon to prevent migration of Na⁺ ions has 
been employed extensively as substrates therefor. A high 
performance version of intrinsically addressed liquid 
crystal displays, "super twisted nematic", requires 
substrates of extremely precise flatness, meaning that the 
soda lime silicate glasses utilized in those displays must 
be polished or alternatively, be made by downdraw fusion, 
see U. S. Patents No. 3,338,696 and 3,682,609. Because devices formed from polycrystalline silicon  
 
(poly-si) are processed at substantially higher 
temperatures than those employed with amorphous silicon (a-Si) 
thin film transistors, glass compositions having strain 
points higher than soda lime silicate glasses and Corning 
7059 glass (strain point of 593°C) have been demanded in 
order to prevent thermal deformation of the sheet during 
processing and to prevent stress buildup, such that 
dimensional change during processing at temperatures above 
about 600°C will be minimized. The use of glasses 
exhibiting strain points in excess of 600°C can eliminate 
the need for careful annealing thereof when used in the 
fabrication of the relatively low temperature a-Si devices. 
Moreover, contamination of the thin film transistors by 
alkali metal migrating from the glass surface has been a 
recognized concern, which concern has resulted in the use 
of coatings to provide barrier layers on the substrate. 
Accordingly, recent glass composition research has been 
directed to the use of alkali metal-free glass compositions 
and having strain points higher than 600°C, preferably 
higher than 625°C, and most preferably higher than 650°C, 
and preferably

A method for preparing a glass sheet having surfaces 
which are essentially defect-free and equivalent in 

smoothness to polished glass surfaces which comprises the 
steps of: 


(a) two alkali metal free glass forming batches of 
different compositions are melted, one batch for a first 

glass exhibiting a strain point higher than 600°C which is 
relatively insoluble in an acid solution and a second batch 

for a second glass consisting essentially, expressed in 
terms of cation percent on the oxide basis, of 

SiO₂23-40B₂O₃0-36SrO and/or BaO0-5 Al₂O₃15-43MgO0-7ZnO0-5 CaO5-25MgO+SrO+BaO+ZnO0-10  
said second glass being at least 1000 times more soluble in 

the same acid solution and exhibiting 

(1) a linear coefficient of thermal expansion from 
its setting point to room temperature within 

about 5 x 10⁻⁷/°C of that of said first glass; 
(2) a strain point higher than 600°C and relatively 

close to the strain point of said first glass; 
and 
(3) a linear coefficient of thermal expansion over 
the temperature range 0°-300°C between 20-60 X 10⁻⁷/°C; 
(b) the molten batches are brought together 
simultaneously while in the molten state to form a 

laminated sheet wherein said first glass is essentially 
completely enclosed within said second glass; 
(c) said laminated sheet is cooled to solidify each 
glass present in molten form; and thereafter 
(d) said laminate is contacted with an acid solution 
to dissolve away said second glass whereby the surface of 

said first glass from which said second glass has been 
removed is rendered essentially defect-free and is 

 
equivalent in smoothness to a polished glass surface.

solution is a mineral acid. 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said first glass 
exhibits a linear coefficient of thermal expansion over the 

temperature range 0°-300°C between 35-60 X 10⁻⁷/°C 
A method according to claim 1 wherein said first glass 
consists essentially, expressed in terms of cation percent 

on the oxide basis, of

of said first glass and the strain point of said second 

glass are both higher than 625°C.

of said second glass is within about 20°C of the strain 

point of said first glass.
