<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a processing
apparatus for light-sensitive material, and more
particularly relates to a processing apparatus for light-sensitive
material in which a powder, granule or tablet
type of solid processing agent is charged into a
processing tank so as to be dissolved into a solution, and
light-sensitive material is subjected to development in
the processing solution.In a conventional processing apparatus for
light-sensitive material in which light-sensitive material
is subjected to development, a replenishing solution to be
charged into the apparatus is put in a transparent bottle.
Therefore, the amount of processing solution remaining can
be visually checked. It can be immediately recognised
when all the processing agent has been consumed, so that
no display of the remaining (residual) amount of the
processing solution is required. When the replenishing
agent is used in the form of a processing solution,
bottles to accommodate the processing solution are bulky
and heavy, so that transportation and charge of the
replenishing processing agent is not easy, and further
environmental pollution, e.g. smell, may be caused.In order to solve the above problems, one may
consider using solid processing agent in the form of
powder, granules, tablets or the like. The replenishing
processing agent in the form of powder, granules or
tablets can be easily supplied to the processing
apparatus, but unless the supply of replenishing agent is
appropriately timed, the quality of processed light-sensitive
material becomes deteriorated. If the solid
processing agent is mistakenly dropped outside the
processing tank, the amount of the processing agent to be 
replenished becomes unbalanced. It is desirable, however,
that even an unskilled worker can control the charge of
solid processing agent.The solid processing agent may be accommodated
in a cylindrical accommodating container or a cartridge.
Then the cylindrical accommodating container is set in a
solid processing agent charging device of the automatic
developer apparatus, and a predetermined amount of the
processing agent is supplied to a processing tank such as
a developing or fixing tank. When a predetermined amount
of processing agent is supplied, a large amount of solid
processing agent is supplied to some tanks, and a small
amount of solid processing agent is supplied to other
tanks. In this case, a plurality of types of solid
processing agents may be packaged in one kit, wherein the
amount of each solid processing agent is appropriately
det
