<ABSTRACT>
Cyclic process for catalytically upgrading a paraffinic 
feedstock and for upgrading the activity of aged catalyst comprising 

the steps a) of supplying feedstock and olefin at a paraffin to

catalyst and removing effluent comprising upgraded product and b) of 
exposing the catalyst to a hydrogenating medium and removing a 

hydrocarbonaceous effluent wherein the catalyst comprises zeolite

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for upgrading a 
paraffinic feedstock. More specifically the invention relates to a 
process for alkylation of a paraffinic feedstock by the condensation 
of paraffins with olefins. The production of highly branched hydrocarbons such as 
trimethylpentane is important by virtue of their use as gasoline 
blending components of high octane number. Traditional production of 
highly branched hydrocarbons is by condensation of isobutane with 
light olefins, usually butenes but sometimes mixtures of propene, 
butenes and possibly pentenes using large quantities of conventional 
strong liquid acid catalysts, such as hydrofluoric or sulphuric acid. 
An emulsion of immiscible acid and hydrocarbon is agitated to emulsify 
the catalyst and reactant and refrigerated to control the highly 
exothermic reaction. By fine control of a complex interrelation of 
process variables high quality alkylate production may be maintained. 
The acid is recycled after use. It is desirable to use a process 
which is less hazardous and toxic and environmentally more acceptable. Processes have been proposed to overcome these problems by using 
solid acids as catalysts. For example, FR-A-2 631 956 describes a 
process for the catalytic alkylation of isobutane or isopentane with a 
C3-C4 olefin in the presence of a zeolite beta solid acid catalyst. However, paraffin olefin condensation yields both desired alkylate 
and undesired oligomerisation product. When catalysing alkylation 
with solid acids it has been found that hydrocarbonaceous deposit 
formation causes progressive deactivation of the catalyst. 
Regeneration techniques are however known for removal of 
hydrocarbonaceous deposits from solid catalysts to restore catalyst 
activity typically by raising the catalyst to elevated temperatures 
and oxidising the deposits but, in US-A-3 851 004, certain catalyst 
compositions comprising at least one hydrogenation agent of nickel, 
ruthenium, rhodium, palladium and platinum and a three-dimensional  
 
crystalline zeolitic molecular sieve having a pore diameter large 
enough to adsorb ortho-diethylbenzene, an alkali metal content of less 
than 3.5 %w on a solids basis and a silica to alumina molar ratio of 
at least 2, are regenerated by contacting the catalyst compositions, 
preferably in the absence of feed olefin, at a temperature of from 
80 °F to 572 °F (26.6 °C to 300 °C) with a liquid solution of hydrogen 
in a saturated hydrocarbon having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, the 
solution
