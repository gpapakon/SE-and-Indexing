<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the preparation of
malt beverages, and more particularly to the preparation
of high alcohol beer having a full, round flavor.In the production of beer, Brewers' yeast is used to
ferment into ethyl alcohol a substrate made of a mixture
of fermentable carbohydrates so called "wort
carbohydrates." The wort carbohydrates involved which can
be fermented by Brewers' yeast are normally maltose,
glucose, maltotriose and traces of sucrose and fructose.
They are obtained by allowing malt enzymes (alpha and beta
amylase) to transform starch molecules from malt and other
adjuncts into the fermentable sugars outlined above. This
is accomplished during the so-called mashing operation.Conventional mashing involves mixing together of malt
and cereal adjuncts in hot water, followed by a series of
heating and resting cycles. Substances which are
solubilized in the hot water are collectively called the
extract. Following mashing, the soluble materials are
extracted in a lauter tub, leaving behind the spent grain.
A clear liquid (wort) obtained by the extraction may then
be transferred to a brew kettle and boiled for a period of
time (kettle boiled) which inactivates the malt enzymes.
Wort compositions vary depending on the raw materials and
mash cycle employed.A typical wort used in brewing may comprise the mixed
extract of a barley malt mash and a cereal adjuncts mash
(typically corn grits or rice). Such mixed extract may be
obtained by treating a kiln dried barley malt with warm
water, e.g. at about 50°C., in one vessel, the so-called
"mash tub", and boiling the cereal adjuncts, (e.g. corn
grits or rice in another vessel, the so-called "cooker"
and then adding the boiling contents of the cooker to the
warm malt suspension in the mash tub. This serves to 
raise the temperature of the mash tub contents typically
to about 57°-67°C. During the rise from 50°C to about
67°C, and starting at around 63°C, the enzymes in the malt
and in particular beta-amylase which is most active
between 60° and 70°C, partially degrade the starches in
both the malt itself and in the corn grits or rice to form
simple fermentation sugars, primarily glucose, fructose
and maltose. These simple sugars are fairly sweet
tasting, and also are fermentable by Brewers' yeast to
alcohol and carbon dioxide.The combined mash is then filtered in a lauter tub,
mash filter or other means and the resulting wort boiled
with hops, filtered, cooled and fermented with yeast, and
carbonated to produce a beer or ale.Conventional

beer flavored beverage, comprising the following

steps :

preparing a mash from barley malt ;
blending this mash with other sources of
