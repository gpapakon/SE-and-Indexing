<ABSTRACT>
A shuttle-type printer includes a media feed assembly (18) to 
controllably transfer a recording media through a printing station and 

a carriage (34) operably mounted at the printing station to move 
bidirectionally across the media. The printer further includes means 

mechanically connected to the carriage and media feed assembly for 
simultaneously (a) moving the carriage and (b) indexing the media 

through the printing station, whereby the means includes a single 
motor (44). Accordingly, a single drive motor can accomplish both 

carriage motion and media advancement.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to shuttle-type printers. Shuttle-type printers are a class of printers having a movable 
shuttle or carriage that traverses back and forth across a printing 
surface. A printhead is mounted on the carriage and synchronized 
with carriage movement to print desired images. The shuttle class 
of printers includes both impact printers, such as dot matrix and 
daisy-wheel printers, and non-impact printers, such as ink-jet printers. Conventional shuttle-type printers have a media feed assembly 
which advances a recording media through the printer and a separate 
shuttle drive assembly which maneuvers the carriage over the 
recording media. The media feed assembly typically consists of 
friction rollers or a tractor feed mechanism and a motor coupled to 
rotate them. The shuttle drive assembly typically consists of a motor 
and a belt and pulley assembly which connects the carriage to the 
motor. Common motors used in these assemblies include DC motors 
which change speed and direction in relation to the level and 
polarity of DC voltage applied thereto, and stepper motors which 
change speed and direction in response to intermittent pulses.  The two motors used for the media feed and shuttle drive 
assemblies are controlled in a synchronized manner. The carriage 
motor drives the carriage back and forth over the media in periodic 
swaths. At the end of each swath, the media feed motor increments 
the recording media within the printer to the next line. Special 
control circuitry is employed to synchronize the operation of these 
two motors. A problem of prior shuttle-type printers concerns the complexity 
of controlling the independent operation of the media feed motor 
and the carriage motor. Sophisticated hardware and firmware are 
necessary to manage both motors. In addition to the cost of each 
motor, there are extra costs resulting from multiple connectors, logic 
boards, and cables needed to operate both motors, as well as added 
power supply requirements. This invention overcomes the above problem by providing a 
mechanism for simultaneously moving the carriage and indexing the 
media by using a single motor. The mechanism thereby eliminates 
one motor and its associated logic board, connector, cable, and power 
supply overhead. According to one aspect of this invention, a mechanism for a 
shuttle-type printer is disclosed. The shuttle-type printer has a media 
feed assembly to controllably transfer a recording media through a 
printing station and a carriage operably mounted at

A mechanism for a shuttle-type printer, the shuttle-type 
printer having a media feed assembly (18) for transferring a recording 

media through a printing station and having a printhead supporting 
carriage (34) mounted at the printing station to move bidirectionally 

across the media, the mechanism comprising: 
   indexing means for controllably advancing the recording media 

through the printing station to position the media relative to the 
carriage (34), the indexing means having first and second 

complementary components that mechanically mate to incrementally 
move the media, the first complementary component being provided 

on the media feed assembly (18) and the second complementary 
component being provided on the carriage (34); and 

   single drive means operably connected to the carriage (34) for 
simultaneously (a) moving the carriage (34) to enable the first and 

second complementary components to mate, and (b) indexing the 
media through the printing station when the first and second 

complementary components mechanically mate.

rotate the indexing wheel (22), the media feed assembly (18) moving 

the media when the indexing wheel (22) is rotated. 
A mechanism according to claim 1 wherein: 
   the first complementary component comprises a helical 

wheel (22) mounted on a rotatable axle (12), the helical wheel (22) 
having elongated slots (23) that follow helical paths about the 

axle (12); and 
   the second complementary component comprises a peg (52) 

mounted on the carriage (34) to mechanically engage a slot (23) of 
the helical wheel (22), the media feed assembly (18) moving the
