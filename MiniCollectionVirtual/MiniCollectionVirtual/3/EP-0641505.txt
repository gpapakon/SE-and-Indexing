<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates in general to radio
communication systems, and more specifically to two-way
radio communication systems comprising a method and
apparatus for performing synchronous encryption and
decryption.Synchronous counter driven encryption techniques for
full duplex digital wireless communication systems are well
known in the art. Such systems normally employ separate
encryption and decryption devices in each communication
unit for encrypting and decrypting a transmit and receive
path, respectively. The use of separate encryption and
decryption devices in each communication unit adds to the
cost and size of the communication unit, as well as
complicating the synchronization of the two devices.In order to maintain synchronization between two linked
communication units, conventional systems must transmit an
encryption synchronization signal (E-sync) along with the
encrypted information. Transmitting the E-sync is not a
problem when the information is stored data, which can be
interrupted without concern. On the other hand,
transmitting the E-sync in a voice communication system
becomes somewhat more difficult, because the voice
information is continuous and cannot be interrupted
periodically for an E-sync transmission without noticeable
gaps or noise bursts in the received voice audio signal. Some conventional voice encryption systems "steal" bits
periodically from the voice information and use the stolen
bits for the transmission of the E-sync, the theory being
that if the bits are stolen only infrequently, their
absence will not seriously degrade the voice audio. Still,
missed bits do degrade the voice audio quality somewhat,
causing encryption systems based on the use of stolen voice
bits not to rate as well in subjective tests of audio
quality while in an encrypting mode as they rate in an
unencrypted, i.e., "clear" mode.Yet another problem with conventional encryption
techniques used in wireless communication systems that can
hand-off a portable communication unit (PCU) from one fixed
communication unit (FCU) to another is associated with the
hand-off procedure. The problem occurs because when two
communication units are linked, the encryption device for
the transmit path of each of the two communication units
supplies the E-sync signal for the decryption device in the
corresponding receive path of the other communication unit.
Thus, after a hand-off to a new FCU, the encryption
synchronization is lost for a period of time required to
resynchronize the decryption device in the PCU with
