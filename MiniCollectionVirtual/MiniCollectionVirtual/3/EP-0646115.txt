<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to heterocyclic-cyclic
amine derivatives of the formula I below, and
pharmaceutically acceptable salts of such compounds. The
compounds of formula I are cholinesterase inhibitors and are
useful in enhancing memory in patients suffering from
dementia and Alzheimer's disease.Alzheimer's disease is associated with degeneration of
cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain that play a
fundamental role in cognitive functions, including memory.
Becker etal., Drug Development Research, 12, 163-195
(1988). As a result of such degeneration, patients
suffering from the disease exhibit a marked reduction in
acetylcholine synthesis, choline acetyltransferase activity,
acetylcholinesterase activity and choline uptake.It is known that acetylcholinesteraae inhibitors are
effective in enhancing cholinergic activity and useful in
improving the memory of Alzheimer's patients. By inhibiting
acetylcholinestrase enzyme, these compounds increase the
level of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, in the brain
and thus enhance memory. Becker etal., supra, report that
behavioral changes following cholinesterase inhibition
appear to coincide with predicted peak levels of
acetylcholine in the brain. They also discuss the efficacy
of the three known acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
physostigmine, metrifonate, and tetrahydroaminoacridine.European Patent Application EP A 0 229 391 relates to
piperidine derivatives of the formula: R1 - X - A - R2.
European Patent Application EP A 296 560 relates to a cyclic
amine-compound of the formula
The present invention relates to compounds of the
formula

wherein R1 and R2 are independently selected from hydrogen,
(C1-C6)alkoxy, benzyloxy, phenoxy, hydroxy, phenyl, benzyl,
halo, nitro, cyano, COR5, -COOR5, -CONHR5, -NR5R6, -NR5COR6,
-OCONR5R6, -NHCOOR5, (C1-C6)alkyl optionally substituted with
from 1 to 3 fluorine atoms; SOpCH2-phenyl or SOp(C1-C6)alkyl,
wherein p is 0, 1 or 2; pyridylmethyloxy or
thienylmethyloxy; 2-oxazolyl, 2-thiazolyl and
benzenesulfonamide; wherein the phenyl moieties of said
phenoxy, benzyloxy, phenyl, benzyl and benzenesulfonamide
groups, the pyridyl and thienyl moieties of said
pyridylmethyloxy or thienylmethyloxy and the oxazolyl and
thiazolyl moieties of said 2-oxaxolyl and 2-thiazolyl may
