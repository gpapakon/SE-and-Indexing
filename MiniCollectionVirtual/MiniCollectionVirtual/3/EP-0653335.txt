<ABSTRACT>
A vehicle occupant shoulder restraint (51c) is located 
on a vehicle door and is inflatable from a stored 

condition on the door to an inflated condition between the 
door and the shoulder area of an occupant. When inflated, 

the occupant shoulder restraint (51c) engages the shoulder 
of the occupant. A vehicle occupant upper rib restraint 

(52c,53c) is located on the vehicle door and is 
inflatable from a stored condition on the door to an 

inflated condition between the door and the upper rib area 
of the occupant. When inflated, the shoulder restraint 

(51c) extends further into the vehicle passenger compartment 
than the upper rib restraint (52c,53c). When inflated, the 

occupant rib restraint (52c,53c) engages the upper rib area 
of the occupant. In another embodiment of the invention 

a vehicle occupant head restraint (210) 
is located on the vehicle door and is inflatable from 

a stored condition on the door to an inflated condition 
between the door and the head of the occupant. When 

inflated, the occupant head restraint (210) engages the 

head of the occupant. The occupant head restraint (210) is 
inflated into position to restrain the head of the occupant 

after the occupant shoulder restraint (51c) has been 
inflated and has restrained the shoulder of the occupant.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and
apparatus for protecting an occupant of a vehicle upon a
collision or the like, and is particularly directed to a
method and apparatus for restraining an occupant of a
vehicle upon a side impact against the vehicle.A vehicle occupant restraint for protecting an
occupant of a vehicle upon a side impact against the
vehicle is known. Typically, such a vehicle occupant
restraint includes an inflatable air bag and a source of
inflation fluid for inflating the air bag, both of which
are mounted on a vehicle door. When a side impact against
the vehicle occurs, the source of inflation fluid provides
inflation fluid to inflate the air bag. The inflated air
bag restrains movement of the occupant and prevents the
occupant from violently striking parts of the vehicle
during a side impact against the vehicle. A one-piece side impact air bag is known from
JP-A-51 62598. This document discloses an airbag having a
horizontal portion and a vertical portion.An alternative vehicle occupant restraint is disclosed
in FR-A-2,675,098 corresponding to the preamble of claims 1 and 4
comprising a plurality of airbags.DE-A-4,119,788 discloses a vehicle occupant restraint
located on the side of a vehicle.DE-A-2,222,621 discloses an airbag comprising a
plurality of compartments. In accordance with one aspect of the present
invention, a vehicle occupant shoulder restraint means is
located on a vehicle side, such as on the vehicle door, and
is inflatable from a stored condition to an inflated
condition between the vehicle side and the shoulder area of
an occupant of the vehicle. When inflated, the vehicle
occupant shoulder restraint means engages the shoulder of
the occupant. A vehicle occupant upper rib restraint means
separate from the shoulder restraint means is also located
on the vehicle side and is inflatable from a stored
condition to an inflated condition between the vehicle side
and the upper rib area of the occupant. When inflated, the
vehicle occupant upper rib restraint means engages the
upper rib area of the occupant.Sensor means is provided for sensing a side impact
against the vehicle. Means is provided for directing
inflation fluid into the vehicle occupant shoulder
restraint means and the vehicle occupant upper rib
restraint means when a side impact against the vehicle is
sensed by the sensor means.The occupant shoulder restraint means has an innermost
occupant contact point in the passenger compartment which
lies in a first vertical plane extending in the forward and
rear
