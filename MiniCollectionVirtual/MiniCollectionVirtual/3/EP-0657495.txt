<ABSTRACT>
A halogen-free blowing agent is used to 
produce isocyanate-based polymeric foams. The blowing 

agent is an organic liquid which is free from halogens 
and contains a positive binary azeotrope having a 

minimum boiling temperature in the range of about 15°C 
to about 80°C at normal atmospheric pressure. 

Particularly preferred is a binary azeotrope of an 
alicyclic hydrocarbon such as cyclopentane or 

cyclohexane and methyl formate. 
The halogen-free blowing agents contemplated 
herein provide the following advantages: no ozone 

depletion potential, no global warming potential, direct 
replacement in foam formulations for 

trichloromonofluoromethane (CFC-11), relatively higher 
blowing action, relatively lower foam density, 

relatively lower thermal conductivity, better 
compatibility, and relatively lower materials cost.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the manufacture of
isocyanate based polymeric foams using a halogen-free
azeotrope of specific type as a blowing agent.Polymeric foams are made using a blowing agent
that generates a cellular structure as polymerization of
reactants takes place. Trichloromonofluoromethane
(CFC-11) has been the most often used physical blowing
agent for various isocyanate-based polymeric foams, such
as polyurethane foams, polyisocyanurate foams, polyurea
foams, and polyamide foams, the hybrid foams, as well as
for thermoplastic foams, e.g., polystyrene foams,
polyethylene foams, polypropylene foams and phenolic
foams.However, due to the well-recognized ozone
depletion problem in the stratosphere, all kinds of
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) must be phased out by the end
of 1995 according to a worldwide regulation. To achieve
that end, some CFC-free, alternative physical blowing
agents have been developed in recent years, albeit with
limited success.Chemical (or reactive) blowing agents such as
water, which generates carbon dioxide gas by the
reaction with isocyanate groups, constitute one class of
such CFC-free blowing agents. However, water has the
following disadvantages as the blowing agent for rigid
foams: a relatively high exotherm which may cause
scorching, high system viscosity, higher K-factor, poor
adhesion to metal substrates due to thinner skin
formation, lower dimensional stability (shrinkage), etc.
In the case of flexible foams, disadvantages of water as
a blowing agent include: relatively high exotherm which 
may cause discoloration and possible fire risk, and
higher system viscosity. Furthermore, integral skin
foam preparation is very difficult with such blowing
agents, and therefore specific, costly polyols are
required.Other chemical blowing agents include
enolizable compounds (K. Ashida, International Progress
in Urethanes, Eds., Ashida, K. Frisch, K.C., Technomic
Publishing Co., Inc. [1980], p. 153), polycarboxylic
acids (U.S. Patent No. 5,057,547 to Doerge), specific
aldehydes or ketones (U.S. Patent No. 5,079,271 to
Gillis).Physical (or non-reactive) blowing agents
constitute another class of alternative blowing agents.
Such physical blowing agents exhibit ozone depletion
potential (ODP) and include the HCFCs
(hydrochlorofluorocarbons, e.g., HCFC 141b, CCl2FCH3),
the HFCs (hydrofluorocarbons, e.g., HFC-356, C4H4F6), the
PFCs (pefluorohydrocarbons, e.g., PF-5050, C5F12) and the
HFCEs (hydrofluorocarbon ethers, e.g., E-245,
CF3CH2OCH3). A physical blowing agent performs a blowing
