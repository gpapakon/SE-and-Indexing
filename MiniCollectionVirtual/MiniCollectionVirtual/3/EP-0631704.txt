<ABSTRACT>
Flow of digitized coded speech packets through virtual circuits in a multi-node communication system (300) is controlled by an adaptive loading capacity device (102) in the nodes (314, 316, 318). The adaptive loading capacity device (102) determines an adjusted throughput data rate ATDR (602, 604) for a node (314, 316, 318) that is substantially equivalent to a predetermined upper limit of the system's capacity. When a requested data rate value RDR included in a frame (200) is greater than the ATDR, the device automatically adjusts the RDR downward to substantially equal the ATDR (702, 704) and incorporates the adjusted RDR into frames (200) transmitted to coupled nodes (314, 316, 318) and stations (302, 308).

<DESCRIPTION>
 DEVICE AND METHOD FOR ADAPTIVELY ADJUSTING LOADING CAPACITY FOR A NODE IN A PACKETIZED COMMUNICATION SYSTEMField of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to capacity in a communication system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a device and method for adjusting loading capacity in a packet-based communication system.BackgroundCommunication resources such as radio frequency channels have a limited capacity. Nevertheless, communication needs have continued to increase. More users are continually being added to communication systems. The efficiency and reliability of a communication system is closely related to its system capacity. System capacity is generally based on the number of available channels and the throughput rate associated therewith. Without technical improvements that provide for loading capacity adjustment, users may face impaired service, or ultimately, a complete lack of available service.Trunked communication systems such as telephone and cellular systems typically include an inherent fixed upper threshold for system capacity, in a digital communication system, this upper threshold is an upper limit that is based on the number of available channels and the throughput rate. When the upper limit of the system's capacity is reached, the system is unable to carry data traffic (i.e., call blocking occurs). For a fixed bandwidth digital communication system, typically maximum throughput is limited to a predetermined 

upper limit that is allowed for a channel. In addition, for a voice channel, if more throughput is allocated to digital representation of voice on the channel, fewer channels can be simultaneously utilized. As traffic on the system increases to a level that approaches the fixed upper limit of the system's capacity, if no flexibility is provided for adjusting the traffic-carrying capacity of the system, call blocking is highly likely to occur.Thus, there is a need for an adaptive capacity loading device and method for providing a more efficient communication system by lowering the probability of call blocking as call traffic approaches the upper limit of the system's capacity.Summary of the InventionAn adaptive loading capacity device for a node and a method for adaptively adjusting a loading capacity for a node are set forth. The device automatically adjusts a data rate of a vocoder for the node in a packet-based linked communication system. The device includes a data traffic-determining unit, operably coupled to receive data traffic, for
