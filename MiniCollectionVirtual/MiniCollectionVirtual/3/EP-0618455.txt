<ABSTRACT>
The inventive methods of making a semiconductor device, e.g., a laser, 
comprise thermal (e.g., 3-5 µm wavelength) imaging of a powered, partially 

completed device. The thermal image is obtained with apparatus that is capable of 
forming a substantially diffraction-limited image on a sensor array with an 

acquisition time of no more than 0.1 seconds, preferable no more than 0.01 seconds. 
In preferred embodiments, the image has temperature resolution of 0.01°C or better. 

Exemplary apparatus is disclosed. The inventive method facilitates, for instance, 
early identification of devices that are likely to fail lifetime requirements.

<DESCRIPTION>
This application relates to semiconductor device manufacture, 
exemplarily to manufacture of opto-electronic devices such as semiconductor lasers. As is well known, semiconductor device manufacture typically involves 
a multiplicity of steps. Many (if not all) of the steps, if not carried out according to 
specification, can result in devices that do not pass final inspection, or that fail during 
life testing. It is obviously expensive, and thus highly undesirable, to have to 
substantially complete device manufacture and then to subject all, or at least a 
representative sample, of the devices to a life test in order to ascertain the adequacy 
of some intermediate manufacturing step. Thus, it would be highly desirable to have 
available an inspection technique that could be used, inter alia, to pre-screen devices, 
and to identify potentially unreliable devices. This application discloses such a 
technique, discloses a manufacturing process that comprises an inspection step that 
involves use of the technique, and also discloses apparatus that can be used to 
practice the technique. Although the apparatus and technique are advantageously employed in 
semiconductor device manufacturing, their use is not thus limited. In particular, the 
apparatus and technique can also advantageously be used in the development of new 
semiconductor device designs and/or of semiconductor device manufacturing 
methods, as those skilled in the art will recognize. It can also be used to test 
packaged devices. Thermal imaging of semiconductor devices is known. See, for instance, 
R. J. Stetson, et al., LaserFocusWorld, June 1990. As stated in that article, non-contact 
temperature measurements can be made" ... with a spatial resolution as 
small as 15 µm." The article further discloses that the prior art IR imaging method 
utilizes scanning, with the scanning rate being on the order of microseconds/point. These capabilities, although adequate for some purposes, are inadequate 
for other purposes. In particular, it would be desirable for many purposes 
(exemplarily including semiconductor laser fabrication) to have available thermal 
imaging means capable of providing a substantially diffraction-limited thermal 
image of a body (exemplarily in the approximate wavelength range 3-5 µm). It  
 
would also be desirable if the high resolution thermal imaging means could form an 
image at a given moment in time (i.e., provide a "snapshot" of the temperature 
distribution at a given moment in time). The former capability could,
