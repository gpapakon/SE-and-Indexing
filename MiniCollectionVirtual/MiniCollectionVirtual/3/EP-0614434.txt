<ABSTRACT>
A drum with a drum closure provided in a drum wall (1) comprises an insert (4) and a shut-off cap which can be placed in the insert (4), which insert (4) is situated in a collar (11) on the drum wall (1) pointing towards the outside of the drum, and has a first flange (6) which rests against the inside (3) of the drum wall, and a second flange (5) which is flanged radially outwards over the collar (11), and also a sealing ring (7) which is wedged between the first flange (6) and the inside of the drum wall (3). An additional seal (10), which may or may not be connected to the sealing ring, is provided between the collar (11) and the insert (4) lying opposite, in order to improve the sealing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a drum with a drum closure provided in a 
drum wall, comprising an insert and a closure cap which can be placed in 
the insert, which insert is situated in a collar on the drum wall 
pointing towards the outside of the drum, and has a first flange which 
rests against the inside of the drum wall, and a second flange which is 
flanged radially outwards over the collar, a sealing ring which is wedged 
between the first flange and the inside of the drum wall to form a first 
seal, and an additional seal formed either by a sealing ring integral 
with the first sealing ring or by a separate sealing ring, which additional 
seal is provided between the collar and the insert lying opposite 
the collar. Such a drum having a drum closure with a second, additional sealing 
ring formed integrally with the first sealing ring is known from US-A-3946894. 
A drum having a drum closure with a second sealing ring which is 
separate from the first sealing ring is known from GB-A-943148. The sealing action of the sealing rings is maintained as long as 
they are held firmly clamped between the insert and the collar. However, 
this clamping action can get lost if the drum falls, topside down, on a 
hard surface. The insert and collar, which project with respect to the 
drum wall, are pressed inwards, which results in an increased spacing 
between the first flange and the drum wall. Thereby, the sealing action 
of the sealing rings is impaired. The objective of the invention is to provide a drum with a drum 
closure which offers a better sealing even in case the insert and collar 
are pressed inwardly. This objective is achieved in that in the area 
delimited by the outer peripheral edge of the first flange on the one 
hand, and of the top edge of the collar on the other hand, the insert and 
the container are in contact only with the sealing rings, in such a way 
that the sealing action is maintained even if the insert is pressed 
inward relative to the collar. Two embodiments of the invention will be explained in greater 
detail with reference to the figures. Figures 1, 2 and 3 show a first embodiment of the drum with drum 
closure. Figures 4, 5 and 6 show a second embodiment. In the embodiment shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 the drum wall is 
indicated by 1. An outward pointing collar 2 is formed in this drum wall  
 
and connects by means of the recessed wall part 3 to the remainder of 
drum wall 1. In the situation shown in Figure 1 the insert, indicated in 
its entirety by 4, is inserted into collar

<CLAIMS>
Drum with a drum closure provided in a drum wall, comprising an 
insert (4) and a closure cap which can be placed in the insert (4), which 

insert (4) is situated in a collar (2, 11) on the drum wall (3) pointing 
towards the outside of the drum (1), and has a first flange (6) which 

rests against the inside of the drum wall (3), and a second flange (5) 
which is flanged radially outwards over the collar (2, 11), a sealing ring 

(7, 12) which is wedged between the first flange (6) and the inside of 
the drum wall (3) to form a first seal, and an additional seal (9, 14) 

formed either by a sealing ring (14) integral with the first sealing ring 
(13) or by a separate sealing ring (9), which additional seal (9, 14) 

is provided between the collar (2, 11) and the insert (4) lying opposite the 
collar, 
characterized in that
 in the area delimited by the outer peripheral 
edge of the first flange (6) on the one hand, and of the top edge 

of the collar (2, 11) on the other hand, the insert (4) and the container 
(1) are in contact only with the sealing rings (7, 9, 12), in such a way 

that the sealing action is maintained even if the insert (4) is pressed 
inward relative to the collar (2, 11).
