<ABSTRACT>
A bed base structure has a portion which can be bent to 
a desired curvature. This is achieved using a bendable 

bed base portion which is comprised of parallel rigid 
strips (9) joined by flexible strips (10) are formed as 

bendable sheets connecting adjacent faces of adjacent 
rigid strips (7) in such a way as to form the inside 

curve of the bendable base portion. Guard elements are 
provided to cover both of the strips at the bendable 

portion of the bed base. The guard members have bodies 
with engagement parts and covers. The covers (14) are so 

shaped as to overlap one another in such a way that they 
remain overlapped in all relative positions of the rigid 

strips of the bed base so as to prevent entrapment of 
fingers or the like as the bed base is adjusted to change 

its curvature.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a bed base structure
having at least a portion which can be bent to a desired
curvature without causing any displeasing feeling of
pressure to a patient lying on the bed.Many recent beds have been equipped with an adjustment
mechanism for example to allow a patient or other user of
the bed to adopt a semi-recumbent position, and various
mechanisms are available. A typical prior art bed has
two base portions simply pivotally connected to each
other at one point. One of these, the so-called back-support
portion (so-called because it is intended to
support the back of the user) can be turned about the
pivotal connection to the other portion so as to adopt
different inclined positions. When the back-support
portion is inclined, however, the joint between the back-support
portion and the main, or hip-support portion
operates as a pivot: therefore, when the back-support
portion is inclined up to a certain angle, the space
between this and the hip-support portion near the joint
is narrowed, and unless the bent portion of the bed base
actually fits that patient's body his waist, abdomen and
legs are uncomfortably pressed by the underside by the
mattress. Other known bed base structures have further
adjustable parts such as an adjustable leg-support
portion having means by which it can be curved to vary
its inclination with respect to the hip-support portion. This, too, suffers from the same problems that,
basically, the pivot is offset from the patient's own
joints (knees, hips, etc) so that changes in inclination
cannot always be achieved in comfort due to the changes
in the available space between inclined parts of a
mattress.An alternative bed structure is described in EP-A-0 220
708 which incorporates a bendable portion between the
back-support and hip-support portions. The bendable
portion is made up from a plurality of substantially
rigid transverse strips with adjacent strips being
pivotally interconnected via integral hinge formations
and associated hinge rods.The object of the present invention is to provide an
alternative bed base structure, which can be bent in a
desirable curvature in such a way that the bent portion
is gently curved so as to ease the feeling of pressure to
any size patient.According to one aspect of the present invention there is
provided a bed base structure for an adjustable bed,
including a bendable portion comprising a plurality of
interconnected, substantially rigid, transverse support
strips, characterised in that the rigid support strips
are

A bed base structure (2) for an adjustable bed (1),
including a bendable portion (8, 8=) comprising a

plurality of interconnected, substantially rigid,
transverse support strips (9), characterised in that the

rigid support strips (9) are interconnected by flexible
connector strips (10) fixed to, or formed integrally

with, adjacent said support strips so as to extend
therebetween and interconnect them, the connector strips

being so formed as to be deformable to a v-shape in
cross-section when compressed by relative movement of the

adjacent rigid strips to allow the said bed portion (8,
8=) to adopt a curved configuration.
A bed base structure (2) according to Claim 1,
characterised in that the bendable portion (8) is located

between a first portion (24) of the bed base structure,
intended to support a user's back, and a central portion

(25) of the bed base structure.
A bed base structure according to Claim 1,
characterised in that said bendable portion (8=) is

located in a position corresponding to that of a user's
knees in use of the bed.
A bed base structure according to any of Claims 1 to
3, characterised in that guards (12) are provided to 

cover respective ends of the rigid support strips forming
the said bendable portion, the said guards (12) having

engagement members (13) engageable with the ends of the
rigid support strips and mutually overlapping cover

elements (14).
A bed base structure according to any of Claims 1 to
4, characterised in that the rigid support strips (9) of

the said bendable portion are hollow strips made of a
synthetic resin.
A bed base structure according to any preceding
claim, characterised in that the flexible strips (10) are

edges and at a portion (20) at or adjacent each edge

connected to the rigid support strips than at the other
parts thereof.
