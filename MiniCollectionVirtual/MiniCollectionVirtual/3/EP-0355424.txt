<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a glass antenna terminal 
device for an automobile in accordance with the preamble 
of claim 1. Such a device is known from US-A-3 599 214. There has been proposed to miniaturize a glass 
antenna system for an automobile by sealing an antenna 
line 70 of a metallic material in a laminated glass plate 
71 and by attaching antenna peripheral circuit elements 
72 and other components 73 at a cut portion 74 formed at 
a circumferential edge of the laminated glass plate 71 as 
in Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication No. 
48681/1977 entitled "Antenna Window Glass" (refer to 
Figure 14). However, the glass antenna as proposed has 
disadvantages as follows. When an antenna peripheral 
circuit element is directly installed in the rear window 
glass of an automobile, it is difficult to carry out 
soldering operations because the size of circuit elements 
is relatively small in comparison with the glass plate. 
It is difficult to attach the elements onto the rear  
 
window glass because a curved glass plate is generally 
used in considering of design of automogile. When an 
antenna device is used for receiving radio waves having 
short wavelengths, the characteristic of the antenna 
device is influenced by accuracy in positioning of the 
circuit elements attached to the surface of the glass 
plate by soldering. It is difficult to obtain highly 
accurate dimentions, and scattering may result with 
respect to the performance of the antenna device. 
Further, it is not desirable to attach the circuit 
elements on the glass plate from the standpoint of 
appearance. As a structure for connecting a power feeding line to 
a bus bar for an electric heating type defogger installed 
in the rear window of an automobile, there has been known 
to connect by soldering a connecting metal fitting having 
a high tensile strength to a power feeding part which is 
formed by printing silver paste in a predetermined 
pattern followed by baking it (refer to Japanese Examined 
Utility Model Publication 37182/1986 and Japanese 
Examined Utility Model Publication No. 11745/1972). It is an object of the present invention to provide a 
glass antenna device for an automobile comprising 
packaged antenna peripheral circuit module which is 
electrically connected to a power feeding point of an 
antenna conductor formed on or in a glass plate of the 
automobile, to thereby eliminate various problems in a  
 
conventional glass antenna device such that it has been 
difficult to attach circuit elements on
