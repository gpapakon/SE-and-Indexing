<ABSTRACT>
An artificial sponge comprises one or more sheets 
constituting a latticework structure drawn together by a 

string or the like to form a dense mass. The latticework 
structure comprises a plurality of polygonal loops (20) 

defined by a plurality of interconnected filaments (21) 
of plastics material. The filaments defining the loops 

are of non-linear, curly or crinkly shape.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an artificial 
mopping/wiping sponge having an improved network texture 
formed by intertwined curled yarns which together defines 
latticework of polygonal lattices that can increase the 
effective contacting area, and therefore the rubbing effect 
between the sponge and the wiped object, thereby enhancing 
the wiping efficiency. Used, often greasy tablewares are practically mopped or 
wiped by means of a soft, porous and absorbent mass, which 
can be natural material, for example, a piece of natural 
sponge or a so-called "sponge-fruit mop" [a fibrous mopping 
mass made of a sponge fruit (sponge gourd)], or synthetic 
material, such as an artificial sponge. The natural materials have the disadvantage that they wear 
rapidly and therefore have poor durability. For this reason, 
artificial sponges are increasingly used to replace them. 
Referring to Figs. 1, 4 and 5, an artificial sponge (10), 
which can be provided with a tying lace (11), is formed by 
drawing and spinning a plastic material into straight yarns 
(31) and knitting them into latticeworks (30) of polygonal 
(preferably hexagonal) lattices which are juxtaposed and 
superposed to form a three dimensional network. Thanks to 
the artificial yarn which has a far stronger resistance to 
wear than the natural material, the durability of the 
artificial sponge is much improved. The disadvantage of the known artificial mopping/wiping 
sponge consists in its relatively poor rubbing effect.  
 
Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, in wiping, the latticework (30) is 
repeatedly rubbed against a surface. Since each lattice 
comprises a hexagonal loop of smooth (here the term "smooth" 
means "uncurled") yarn, which tends to "slip" on a surface 
instead of rubbing heavily thereon, the effort applied by the 
hand cannot be efficiently transformed into the friction 
between the artificial sponge and the wiped object. As a 
result, the mopping efficiency is altogether unsatisfactory. Moreover, since the hexagonal lattices, with their smooth 
yarns that define the hexagonal loops, can be easily 
compressed to a much smaller volume, the effective, 
contacting area between the sponge and the wiped object is 
greatly reduced when a force is applied, the insufficient 
wiping efficiency is further worsened. Accordingly it is the object of the present invention to 
provide an artificial mopping/wiping sponge with an improved 
texture which obviates or mitigates the aforesaid drawbacks. Since it is the "smoothness" of the loop of the
