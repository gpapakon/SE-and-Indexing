<ABSTRACT>
Device for load measurement in roller bearings 
whereby the measurement is carried out by means of sensors 

arranged to measure forces applied on the bearing, and which 
communicate with means for recording, processing and evaluation 

of signals emitted from the sensors, which are representative 
of the bearing load, whereby at least one roller body (4a,4b) 

per roller body row is provided with at least one bore (7) in 
which is provided at least one sensor (8), as well as means 

(9,10) for amplification and transmisson of signals emitted 
from said sensor to a receiver (11) provided at the nonrotating 

bearing ring of the bearing, from which receiver said signals 
are conducted further to external means for signal processing, 

and so on.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention refers to roller bearings with
the ability to sense and determine a bearing load in magnitude
as well as in direction.In many connections where primarily large roller
bearings come to use it is from an aspect of process control
of great interest to be able to determine the momentary load
of the bearing. Thus one can for example with knowledge about
the bearing load in an ore mill control the degree of filling
of the mill at an optimal level from an aspect of milling.
Further it is possible to continuously monitor the condition
of the bearing by means of the bearing load, since deviations
from normal values may indicate different error functions or
damages on the bearing.For such purposes one has previously suggested
different types of force measurement bearings, where the forces
and loads are measured with strain gauge transducers located
at the inner and/or the outer ring, which by influence of
changing load, which occurs during operation, obtain a measurable
change of electric resistance of the transducer whereby
load variations according to the principle for an amplitude
modulated carrier frequency system generates a carrier frequency
the amplitude of which represents the measurement value.
This means that the rings have to be provided with a great
number of strain gauge transducers, at the same time as a
relatively complicated and thereby costly calibration of the
bearing is required. Also for the rest there are certain
imperfections in these prior systems, which are known for
example through US-A-4,203,319.US-A-4,175,430 discloses a device for measurement of
load applied on very large rolling element bearings having a
plurality of rollers disposed between rails and wherein a
sensor in form of a linear displacement transducer provided in
a cavity in one roller monitors a dimension of said cavity, to
establish the load applied on the roller in question. Such
arrangement can not be readily used for an ordinary roller 
bearing having rollers disposed between an outer and an inner
ring as the load on such a bearing roller varies as the roller
moves in the circular path thereby moving between the loaded
zone of the bearing and zones of more or less load.The object of the present invention is to offer a
load sensing roller bearing, in particular of large dimensions
and which is not afflicted with drawbacks of previous solutions,
and this has been achieved by providing the bearing
with the features defined in the patent claim 1.Through the solution according to the invention,
