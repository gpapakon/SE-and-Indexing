Claims for the following Contracting States :
AT, BE, CH, DE, DK, FR, GB, IT, LI, LU, NL, SE
Antigen,
wherein

it reacts immunogenically with an antibody against
the 31 kD antigen (OspA) of B. burgdorferi and

contains the following amino acid sequence or an
immunogenic epitope from this sequence:


Antigen as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the DNA sequence that codes for it is located on a
vector, preferably a prokaryotic vector, which is

suitable for protein expression.
Antigen as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein

the antigen is a β-galactosidase fusion protein or
a non-fusion protein.
Recombinant DNA,
wherein
,

it codes for an antigen as claimed in one of the
claims 1, 2 or 3 and contains (1) the nucleic acid

sequence shown in the following or (2) a sequence
corresponding to it within the scope of the

degeneracy of the genetic code:

Recombinant vector,
wherein

it contains one or several copies of a recombinant
DNA as claimed in claim 4.
Recombinant vector as claimed in claim 5,
wherein

the vector is a prokaryotic vector.
Recombinant vector as claimed in claim 6,
wherein

it is a plasmid.

Process for obtaining of antigens from
B. burgdorferi ZS7,
wherein

a B. burgdorferi ZS7 (DSM 5527) gene bank is
examined with one or several monoclonal antibodies

that are specific for the 31 kD antigen (OspA) or
the 34 kD antigen (OspB) of B. burgdorferi and the

clones are isolated which exhibit a positive immune
reaction with the antibody or the antibodies. 
Active vaccine against Lyme disease,
characterized by

one or several antigens as claimed in one of the
claims 1 to 3 as an active substance together with

common carriers, fillers and auxiliary substances.
Vaccine as claimed in claim 10,
wherein

the antigen is obtained by genetic engineering.
Active vaccine against Lyme disease,
characterized by

one or several recombinant antigens which react
immunogenically with an antibody against the 31 kD

antigen (OspA) of B. burgdorferi or with an
antibody against the 34 kD antigen (OspB) of

B. burgdorferi as an active substance optionally
together with common carriers, fillers and

auxiliary substances wherein the antigens are

following amino acid sequence or an immunogenic

epitope from this sequence:

wherein

the DNA sequence coding therefor is introduced into
a host cell, the DNA sequence is expressed in the

host cell and the antigen is isolated. 
Process as claimed in claim 1,
wherein

the DNA sequence that codes for the antigen is
located on a vector, preferably a prokaryotic

vector, which is suitable for protein expression.
Process as claimed in claim 1 or 2,
wherein

the antigen is a β-galactosidase fusion protein or
a non-fusion protein.
Process as claimed in one of the claims 1 to 3,
wherein
,

the DNA sequence contains (1) the nucleic acid
sequence shown in the following or (2) a sequence

corresponding to it within the scope of the
degeneracy of the genetic code:

wherein

the vector is a plasmid.
Process as claimed in claim 5,
wherein

the vector is pZS-7/31-2 (DSM 5528).
Process for obtaining antigens from B. burgdorferi
ZS7,
wherein

a B. burgdorferi ZS7 (DSM 5527) gene bank is
examined with one or several monoclonal antibodies

that are specific for the 31 kD antigen (OspA) or
the 34 kD antigen (OspB) of B. burgdorferi and the

clones are isolated which exhibit a positive immune
reaction with the antibody or the antibodies.
Process for the production of an active vaccine
against Lyme disease, wherein one or several

antigens which react immunogenically with an
antibody against the 31 kD antigen (OspA) of

B. burgdorferi or with an antibody against the
34 kD antigen (OspB) of B. burgdorferi are

formulated as an active substance, optionally 
together with common carriers, fillers and

auxiliary substances into a pharmaceutical
composition.
Process as claimed in claim 8,
wherein

an antigen as claimed in claim 1 is used.
Process as claimed in claim 8 or 9,
wherein

the antigen is obtained by genetic engineering.
