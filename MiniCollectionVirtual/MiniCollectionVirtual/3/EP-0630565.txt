<ABSTRACT>
An implement for milking animals, such as cows, 
comprises a milking parlour and a robot arm (7) coupled to a 

frame (6, 37) and being capable of carrying teat cups (80). 
These teat cups (80) can automatically be connected to the 

teats of an animal. The frame (6, 37) with the robot arm (7) 
is movable relative to the milking parlour, while the 

implement further comprises a sensor device (5), which is 
kept in contact with the rear side of an animal and provides 

for the control of the position of the frame (6, 37) at such 
a way that the frame (6, 37) with the robot arm (7) will 

follow the movements of the animal in the milking parlour.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an implement
according to the preamble of claim 1.Such an implement is known from EP-A-0 188 303.
This implement has the disadvantage that the animal has no
freedom to move in the longitudinal direction of the milking
parlour as the sensor device limits this movement. It is an
object of the invention to improve such an implement.To that end, according to the invention, the
implement as described in the opening paragraph is
characterized by the features as defined in the
characterizing part of claim 1.In a specific embodiment the sensor device
comprises a sensor and a control mechanism, the sensor being
forced against the rear side of the animal while by means of
the control mechanism the position of the sensor and the
position of the frame are brought and hold in accordance with
each other.The force exerted by the sensor against the rear
side of the animal may be adjustable. In a specific
embodiment the sensor is forced against the rear side of the
animal by means of a spring, while the control mechanism is
provided with a lever mechanism coupled with the sensor and
pivotable relative to the frame, the spring being active
between the lever mechanism and the frame.Further according to the invention a construction
may be obtained wherein the sensor device forms the rear side
of the milking parlour; in this respect the sensor device may
comprise a frame part movably connected with the frame. This
movable frame part may have such a form that it constitutes a
further limitation of movement of the hind sides of the 
animal in sideward direction.The frame with the robot arm may be movable along a
guide rod, particularly by means of a cylinder in the length
direction of the milking parlour and active between the frame
with the robot arm and the frame of the milking parlour. The
sensor device will be coupled to said cylinder.For a stable movement of the frame with the robot
arm in the length direction of the milking parlour the frame
is provided with a vertical frame beam to which a robot arm
is connected slidably in height, said frame beam being
movable along the guide rod and, thereby, being guided by a
further guide rail.For a better understanding of the invention and to
show how the same may be carried into effect, an embodiment
thereof will now be described with reference to the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a side view of a cow present in a
milking parlour;Figure 2 is, to an enlarged scale, a more detailed
part of the side view according to Figure 1;Figure 3

<CLAIMS>
Implement for milking animals, such as cows,
comprising a milking parlour and a robot arm (7) coupled to a

frame (6, 37) and being capable of carrying teat cups (80)
which can automatically be connected to the teats of an

animal, and which robot arm can be turned from outside the
milking parlour to under the animal's udder and be positioned

therebelow, the implement further comprising a sensor device
(5), capable of establishing the animal's position in the

milking parlour, in particular the animal's position in the
longitudinal direction relative thereto, and adapted to bear

against the hindside of the animal, 
characterized in that
 the
positioning is done by means of a sensor for establishing the

position of the teats, while the implement further is
provided with means (87 - 97) for individually moving

upwardly said teat cups (80) relative to the robot arm (7),
the teat cups (80) being releasable from the robot arm (7),

so that, when a vacuum is produced in a teat cup (80), the
said teat cup (80) can suck to a relevant teat and be

released from the robot arm (7), the implement further
comprising a flexible connecting member (81), forming a

flexible connection between the robot arm (7) and a teat cup
(80) during milking and being capable of pulling said teat

cup (80) towards and against the robot arm (7) when the
milking flow through said teat cup (80) has ended, the frame

(6, 37) of the robot arm (7) being movable relative to the
milking parlour in longitudinal direction and the robot arm

(7) being connected pivotably to said frame (6, 37), in such
a way that the frame (6, 37) with the robot arm (7) follows

the movements of the animal in the milking parlour.
Implement as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the sensor device (5) comprises a sensor (28) and a
control mechanism (27), the sensor (28) being forced against

the rear side of the animal while by means of the control
mechanism (27) the position of the sensor and the position of 

the frame (6, 37) are brought and hold in accordance with
each other.
Implement as claimed in claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 the force exerted by the sensor (28) against the rear
side of the animal is adjustable.
Implement as claimed in claim 2 or 3, 
characterized
in that
 the sensor (28) is forced against the rear side of
the animal by means of a spring (32), while the control

mechanism (28) is provided with a lever mechanism (30, 33)
coupled with the sensor (28) and pivotable relative to the

frame (6, 37), the spring (32) being active between the lever
mechanism (30, 33) and the frame (6, 37).
Implement as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the sensor device (5) forms the
rear side of the milking parlour.
Implement as claimed in claim 5, 
characterized in
that
 the sensor device (5) comprises a frame part (26)
movably connected with the frame (6, 37).
Implement as claimed in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the frame (6, 37) is movable
along a guide rod (9).
Implement as claimed in claim 7, 
characterized in
that
 the frame (6, 37) is movable along the guide rod (9) by
means of a cylinder (14) in the length direction of the

milking parlour and active between the frame (6, 37) with the
robot arm (7) and the frame of the milking parlour.
Implement as claimed in claim 8, 
characterized in
that
 the sensor device (5) is coupled to the cylinder (14).
Implement as claimed in claim 8 or 9, 
characterized
in that
 the frame (6, 37) is provided with a vertical frame
beam (6) to which a robot arm (7) is connected slidably in

height, said frame beam (6) being movable along the guide rod
(9) and, thereby, being guided by a further guide rail (12).
