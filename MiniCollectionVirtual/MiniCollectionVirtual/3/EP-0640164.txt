<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to office panelling
systems and, in particular, to office panelling systems
which utilize free-standing frames w..ich are interconnected
to collectively support the system.Free-standing office panelling systems are known
and one particular system which has proven popular is shown
in our United States Patent 4,535,577. These free-standing
systems have improved structural rigidity when they are
mechanically interconnected, and one such arrangement for
mechanically interconnecting such systems is shown in our
United States Patent 4,881,349.The office panelling system not only subdivides
free office space into various working areas or units, it
also provides for power at these work units and
accommodates the feeding of communication cables and the
like through the system. It has been found that power at
desk height is the most convenient and this capability was
provided in our earlier patent. There remains a need to
simplify the provision of power at desk height and to allow
for the convenient locating positioning of power outlets at
the desk height.There is also a need to simplify the manufacture of
decorative elements secured to the panels and improving the
definition and edge detail thereof.An office panelling system, according to the
present invention
is defined by the features of independent claim 1. 
The side plates are preferably
removable to provide increased access when the decorative
covers are removed.According to an aspect of the invention, an open
storage area is above the top plate and this open storage
area is closed at the sides by a movable elongate cover
which can be moved to provide access to the storage area.According to yet a further aspect of the invention,
the movable elongate cover is hinged at an upper edge
thereof and connected to the frame.According to yet a further aspect of the invention,
the movable elongate cover is foldable upon itself in the
longitudinal direction thereof to reduce the amount of free
space required to open the storage area by movement of the
elongate cover.The hinging and folding of the elongate cover are
preferred to removal, however, this is also an option.According to yet a further aspect of the invention,
electrical outlets are provided in the storage area and the
upper surface thereof are positioned at a level generally
corresponding with the bottom edge of the movable elongate
cover.According to yet a further aspect of the invention,
the electrical outlets are mounted in a box enclosure
secured to the top plate of the

<CLAIMS>
An office panelling system comprising;

a number of separate, mechanically interconnectable, panels (2),
each panel (2) includes an interior frame (10) which supports removable
decorative elements (4, 6) either side thereof,
said panels (2) cooperating to define a horizontal electrical conduit (20)
extending in the length of the panels (2) and located behind said decorative elements

(4) and intermediate the height of the interior frames (10),
said electrical conduit (20) in each panel (2) having:

a top plate (60),
side plates (50) and
a bottom member (15, 17) which cooperates with said side plates (50) and
said top plate (60) to close said conduit (20);
said top plate (60) having a number of knock-out ports (62) for receiving
electrical outlets (72), which when received are accessible above said top plate (60);

and
said top plate (60) being releasably secured within said frame (10) by a
mechanical fastening arrangement (54) which allows release of said top plate (60) to

accommodate changes within the electrical conduit (20) and subsequent resecurement
of said top plate within said frame (10).
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 1,
wherein said side plates (50) are trapped between said top

plate (60) and said bottom member (15,17) and are
immediately removable from said frame (10) once said top

plate (60) has been removed.
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 1 or
claim 2, wherein an open storage area (22) is provided above

said top plate (60) and said open storage area (22) is
closed at the sides thereof by a movable elongate element 

(6) by means of which said storage area (22) is accessible.
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 3,
wherein said movable elongate element (6) is hinged at an

upper edge thereof and connected to said frame.
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 4
wherein said movable elongate element (6) is foldable in the

longitudinal direction thereof to reduce the amount of free
space required to open said moveable elongate element (6)

and access said storage area (22).
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 5,
including electrical outlets (72) accessible in said storage

area (22) and secured to said top plate (60) and connected
to power within said electrical conduit (20) through one of

said knock-out ports (62) in said top plate (60) covered by
said electrical outlets (70).
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 6,
wherein said electrical outlets (72) are mounted in a box

enclosure (70) secured to said top plate (60) and presenting
said electrical outlets (72).
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 7,
wherein said moveable element (60) is of metal plate and the

decorative element (4) below said movable element (60) is of
an acoustical material.
An office panelling system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein said interior frame (10) includes interior

horizontal members extending across said frame (10)
intermediate a top and bottom edge of said frame (10), said

interior horizontal members (4a) and a top member (14) of
said frame (10) having a recessed upper surface for engaging 

office filing cabinets or bins hung therefrom to support
such office filing cabinets or bins intermediate the height

of said frame (10) and to one side of said office panelling
system.
An office panelling system as claimed in claim 9,
wherein the vertical spacing of said interior horizontal

members (14a) is coordinated with office storage components
of a predetermined height to provide lower support at the

back face of office storage components when hung from said
frame (10).
An office panelling system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein top plate (60) includes slots (64) in end

portions thereof which cooperate with said mechanical
fastening arrangement (54) for ease of removal of said top

plate (60) by loosening of said mechanical fastening
arrangement (54).
An office panelling system as claimed in any preceding
claim, wherein said side plates (50) include downwardly

opening offset tabs (51) to one side thereof which slidably
engage said bottom member (15,17) and releaseable secured

said side plates (50) above said bottom member (15,17).
