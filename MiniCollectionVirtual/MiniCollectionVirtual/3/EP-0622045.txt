<ABSTRACT>
An absorbent article for collecting non-aqueous 
liquids such as oil-based products, comprising a low 

density, structurally integral board of peat moss material 
manifesting an affinity for non-aqueous liquids while 

being hydrophobic in order to block undesirable water 
penetration in the absorbent medium. The invention also 

extends to a method for manufacturing the absorbent 
article.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the general field of 
spill management and, more particularly, to a novel 
absorbent article utilizing peat moss material for 
collecting non-aqueous liquids such as oil-based products. 
The invention also extends to a method for manufacturing 
the absorbent article. The prior art has recognized the potential of peat 
moss material for use as an absorbent medium in structures 
for absorbing aqueous solutions. The remarkable fluid 
absorption properties of peat moss material have been 
turned to use in the field of sanitary, disposable 
absorbent products such as sanitary napkins, tampons, 
diapers, adult briefs, urinary pads, wound dressings and 
the like, to provide highly efficient absorbent components 
which can be made relatively thin for better fit, comfort 
and discretion, while being sufficiently absorbent to 
prevent overflow leakage of body exudate and garment 
staining.  
 The following United States patents document the use 
of peat moss material for manufacturing absorbent 
components for sanitary, disposable absorbent products. 
PATENT #INVENTOR(s)DATE OF ISSUE4,170,515Lalancette et al.October 9, 1979 4,215,692LevesqueAugust 5, 1980 4,226,237LevesqueOctober 7, 1980 4,305,393NguyenDecember 15, 1981 4,473,440OvansSeptember 25, 1984 4,507,122LevesqueMarch 26, 1985 4,618,496BrasseurOctober 21, 1986 4,676,871Cadieux et al.June 30, 1987 4,992,324DubéFebruary 12, 1991 5,053,029YangOctober 1, 1991 The subject matter of these patents is incorporated 
herein by reference. Peat moss material can be formed in a highly 
cohesive, structurally integral board by any one of the 
methods disclosed in the above-identified prior art. In 
board form, the absorbent material is more convenient to 
handle and it can be directly processed in high speed 
automatic equipment for assembling disposable absorbent 
products.  
 Broadly stated, the method developed by the industry 
for manufacturing a structurally integral peat moss board 
which is specifically adapted for sanitary usage, 
comprises the following steps. Raw peat moss, in 
particulate form, is classified by wet screening in order 
to retain only the particles which are the most absorbent. 
The screened fraction is diluted with water to form a 
slurry having a pumpable consistency which is sheeted on 
a Fourdrinier wire and dewatered by the sequential 
application of vacuum and heat. The thus formed board is 
calendered at high pressure to increase its density 
primarily for the purpose of enhancing its drying power, 
i.e. the

<CLAIMS>
An absorbent article for collecting a non-aqueous 
liquid comprising a low density, hydrophobic, structurally 

integral board of peat moss material manifesting an affinity 
for the non-aqueous liquid, whereby said board of peat moss 

material is capable of absorbing the non-aqueous liquid 
under the effect of capillary pressure, wherein the peat 

moss material is bonded to a reinforcing layer. 
The absorbent article of claim 1, wherein said board 
of peat moss material is oleoliphic and capable of absorbing 

oil-based products. 
The absorbent article of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein 
said board of peat moss material has a density in the range 

from 0.02 g/cc to 0.20 g/cc, preferably from 0.05 g/cc to 
0.15 g/cc, and most preferably from 0.05 g/cc to 0.10 g/cc. 
The absorbent article of any one of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein said reinforcing layer forms an outer surface of 

said absorbent article, to enhance the structural integrity 
of said absorbent article. 
The absorbent article of claim 4, wherein said board 
of peat moss material includes an absorbent layer of peat 

moss material united in a face-to-face relationship with 
said reinforcing layer, said reinforcing layer being made of 

a fibrous material. 
The absorbent article of claim 4 or claim 5, wherein 
said board of peat moss material includes a pair of 

reinforcing layers of fibrous material in a spaced apart 
relationship, said absorbent layer of peat moss material 

being mounted between said reinforcing layers of fibrous 
material. 
The absorbent article of claim 5 or claim 6, wherein  
 

said fibrous material comprises Kraft wood pulp fibers, 
cotton linters, ground wood or a mixture thereof. 
The absorbent article of any one of claims 1 to 7, 
wherein said board of peat moss material includes a water-repelling 

agent. 
The absorbent article of any one of claims 1 to 8 for 
recovering an oil-based liquid floating on a body of water, 

said absorbent article including a structurally integral and 
buoyant board of peat moss material, said board of peat moss 

material being hydrophobic and oleoliphic, whereby when said 
board of peat moss material is floated on the body of water 

in contact with the oil-based liquid, said board of peat 
moss material selectively absorbs the oil-based liquid 

without taking-up any significant amount of water. 
A method for manufacturing the absorbent article of 
any one of claims 1 to 9, said method comprising the steps 

of: 

a) forming a liquid suspension of peat moss 
material; 
b) sheeting said suspension onto a reinforcing 
layer; and 
c) extracting fluidizing medium from said suspension 
to form a low density board of peat moss material, 
 
   said method being completed without conditioning said 

peat moss material with wetting agent to preserve a natural 
hydrophobicity of the peat moss material in order to impede 

water penetration in the article.
