<ABSTRACT>
An intake system for a reciprocating internal combustion engine adapted to control operation of the engine to produce a high level of torque across a wide range of engine revolutions. The intake system is formed by a plenum (3) feeding a plurality of manifold tubes (4) dimensioned so as to improve volumetric efficiency of the engine by inducing ram air effects in a naturally aspirated engine over a wide range of rotational speeds. There is also disclosed an exhaust system which makes use of kinetic effects to improve cylinder charging and scavenging and an air flow throttle control device.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an intake and exhaust system principally for
reciprocating piston internal combustion engines.Natural laws of flow dynamics govern the Volumetric Efficiency (VE)
of any engine at a particular RPM. Intake manifold efficiency, valve and port
size, camshaft valve timing and exhaust manifold configurations are a few of
the more readily identifiable factors affecting VE. However there is a "ram"
effect inherent in all engines that helps improve VE, in the same way a
supercharger increases horsepower.The object of this invention is to provide improvements in three
major factors being the intake system, exhaust system and camshaft valve
timing ultimately to function as a unit which may be referred to as the
Inertia-Supercharging & Superscavenging Process (ISSP) system.The concept of the ISSP system is to produce over the entire RPM
range of any engine a substantially greater than conventional amount of
atmospheric pressure differential within the cylinders through both ISSP
intake and exhaust systems, thereby causing the outside atmospheric
pressure through the ISSP intake system to force a substantially greater than
conventional amount of air mass into the substantially lower than
conventional cylinder pressures on the intake and compression strokes,
thereby producing higher than conventional cylinder pressures on the
combustion stroke which facilitates forcing of a substantially greater than
conventional amount of gas column flow through a self extracting ISSP
exhaust system which produces a lower than conventional pressure
environment behind the gas column flow which also contributes to
producing substantially lower than conventional cylinder pressures on the
exhaust stroke thereby lowering cylinder pressures even further for the next
intake stroke cycle. By using the aspects of the present invention
independently or in combination it is possible to substantially increase
Volumetric Efficiency and torque levels and substantially reduce fuel
consumption over substantially the entire RPM range of any engine which
will provide an alternative to previous conventional systems designed to
produce performance with economy. The features of the invention are defined in the independent claims, optional features
are defined in the dependant claims. The invention will now be described by way of example with
reference to the drawings, in which:-
