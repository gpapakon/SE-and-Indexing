waveguides is coupled to the primary feeder waveguide through 

an aperture so that received signals from N helical antenna

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a planar antenna for the
reception of Direct Broadcast Satellite(DBS) television
signals; and, more particularly, to an improved planar antenna
capable of providing enhanced aperture efficiency, improved
circular polarization and increased production tolerability.Reception of direct broadcast signals with around 12 GHz
carrier frequency from a satellite requires a circularly
polarized antenna with high gain and low axial ratio.
Recently, various types of planar antennas have been proposed
for DBS reception at this frequency range. The planar antenna
is made of an array of antenna elements, each antenna element
being capable of receiving 12 GHz signals. Since these
antenna elements constituting the array must be able to
receive signals of a short wavelength, e.g., in the
neighborhood of 2.5 cm, they must be small in size and a large
number of such antenna elements is required in order to
provide sufficient energy for satisfactory television
pictures. Two of such planar antennas are disclosed in U.S. Patent
4,680,591 (see also corresponding EP 0 132 945 A1) and U.S. Patent 4,907,012, each comprising an array of helical
antenna elements with probes located within a common resonant
cavity having a square cross section. The cavity is used to
combine all the outputs from the elements with a low loss.
Specifically, in U.S. patent 4,907,012, four inwardlyprotruding
buttresses are provided in the antenna, wherein
each buttress is positioned mid-way along a side of the cavity
to promote the formation of standing waves of a different mode
thereby to improve the frequency range characteristics of the
array. Moreover, GB 2 227 369 discloses a circular polarisation antenna system
having no primary feeding waveguide and no set
of secondary feeding waveguides.
An antenna according to the preamble of Claim 1 is known from U.S. Patent
4,680,591 and ist corresponding EP 0 132 945 A1.Since, however, these antennas employ resonant cavity to
combine the outputs from the elements by forming standing
waves, the antenna elements must be arranged precisely, which
will in turn reduce the production tolerability.It is, therefore, a primary object of -the present
invention is to provide an improved planar antenna capable of
providing higher aperture efficiency, improved circular
polarization and increased production tolerability through the
use of waveguides along with an array of helical antenna
elements. This object is solved by the features of the antenna
according to Claim 1.In accordance with
