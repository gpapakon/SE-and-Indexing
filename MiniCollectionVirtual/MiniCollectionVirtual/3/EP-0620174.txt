<ABSTRACT>
In a device for continuously separating sheets of a sheet pile from a stacking magazine having a suction element which in each case grips the sheet to be separated in the region of a leading edge and tilts it away from the sheet pile, having a gripper mechanism to receive the tilted sheet and draw it off the sheet pile, having a front stop of the stacking magazine, possibly with separating tips, and having a pile lifter which can be driven below the front region of the sheet pile and supports the latter, provision is made, for reliable separation of the printed sheets, for a stop part (7, 7a) to be assigned to the front stop (3), which stop part acts on a sheet following the tilted sheet (1a) and can be moved back in temporal co-ordination with the movement of the suction element (5) in the sense of releasing the sheet (1a), to be tilted in each case, from the stop part (7, 7a).

<CLAIMS>
Device for serially separating sheets of a sheet
stack (1) from a stack magazine, this device having

a suction element (5) which in each instance grasps
the sheet to be separated, in the vicinity of its

front edges, and downwardly inclines it from the
sheet stack (1), having a gripper mechanism (8)

for acquiring the downwardly inclined sheet (1a)
from said sheet stack (1), having a stack magazine

boundary in the form of a front stop (3) which if
appropriate has separating points (4), and having

a stack lifter (70) which can be moved to below
the front portion of the sheet stack (1), supporting

it, characterized in that a vertical stopping face
(7a) is assigned to the front stop (3), this stopping

face (7a) acting on sheets that follow a sheet (1a)
which has been downwardly inclined, and being

backwardly movable in synchronism with the movement
of the suction element (5), in the sense of releasing

the spine fold of that sheet (1a) which is to be
downwardly inclined at that moment in time, from

the stopping face (7a).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the stop (3) presents a clearance space (3a) for

the sheet that follows the sheet (1a) which has 
been downwardly inclined, and a stop component (7)

can be moved into a position flush with the stopping
face of the stop (3), barring the clearance space.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in
that the stop component (7) is formed by the stack

lifter (70) and can be brought into a position with
a stopping face (7a) flush with the stopping face

of the stop (3).
