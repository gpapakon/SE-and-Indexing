<ABSTRACT>
A stabilizing system for use with a vehicle suspension 
which employs a first and second strap (55) or other 

flexible tension member associated with and extending 
between opposite control arm assemblies (24, 26) of the 

suspension. A first end of each strap is anchored to a 
corresponding control arm assembly. A second end, distal 

the first end, of each strap is anchored to the control arm 
assembly distal the first end. Each strap, alternately, 

weaves over and under at least two guides (48, 54) 
associated with and positioned between the path of the 

straps. The guides and/or bushings associated with anchor 
points (50, 52) may be formed of a yieldable material to 

provide a yieldable biasing action on the straps. An 
adjustment assembly (106, Fig. 5) may be associated with 

each strap to pre-load the associated strap to a desired 
tension. The stabilizing system occupies space between the 

control arm assemblies and is very lightweight due to the 
thin belt-like characteristics of the straps. The 

stabilizing system of the present invention functions to 
transfer forces imposed on one control assembly to the 

opposite control arm assembly by alternately placing an 
associated strap in tension or allowing the other strap to 

go slack. The flexible tension members or straps are 
preferably connected to the control arms at locations 

tending to minimize the effect of single wheel impact 
loads.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a stabilizing system
for use with a vehicle. More particularly, the present
invention pertains to a stabilizing system for use in
resisting rolling motion of a vehicle.A variety of suspension systems are available to
minimize and control the vibrations, jostling, as well as
other vehicle displacements such as roll associated with a
moving vehicle. A vehicle suspension system usually
includes a suspension assembly positioned between opposing
wheels of the vehicle and attached to the vehicle inboard
of the wheels. The suspension assembly includes a
connection point or steering knuckle associated with each
wheel providing an axis about which the wheel rotates and
carried by a control arm assembly pivotally associated with
a cross member which is attached to the vehicle frame. A
control arm and a biasing or spring assembly operatively
connected to the control arm are provided such that when
the control arm is pivotally displaced, the biasing
assembly dampens the shock of the displacement to minimize
or prevent transmission throughout the vehicle.GB 350415 discloses a vehicle stabilizer in which two
parallel ridged arms surround the vehicle axle loosely, the
arms being provided on a rocking transverse spindle. This
maintains the vehicle chassis generally parallel to the
axle whilst allowing some relative movement between the
axle and chassis in the vertical direction, but preventing
relative lateral movement. In preferred examples disclosed
in this prior art, an elastic connection is provided
between the spindle and axle.With a more specific view towards prior art suspension
systems, a widely used form of suspension system employs a
rigid cross member or assembly attached to the vehicle
frame having a pivotal control arm assemblies pivotally
attached to opposed ends of the cross member. As the
vehicle makes a turn, the body of the vehicle tends to roll 
away from the direction of the turn. In order to dampen or
minimize the rolling effect, a stabilizing assembly or
system such as a torsion bar has been used to transfer a
portion of the energy resulting from the rolling action
from one side of the vehicle to the other. Prior art
torsion bars are generally constructed using a heavy gauge,
steel bar or group of bars which are attached to the
suspension assembly so that a degree of road shock and roll
energy is transferred to twisting the torsion bar. Such a
torsion bar mounts to the frame or chassis and to control
arms at opposite ends.The energy or force transferred to twisting

A stabilizing system for use with a vehicle
suspension, said suspension having first and second

oppositely positioned control arm assemblies (62, 64),
said stabilizing system comprising:


first and second anchor means (88, 90) operatively
associated with said each of said first and second

oppositely positioned control arm assemblies (62, 64);
first and second linking means (82, 84) for
tensionably linking said opposed control arm assemblies

(62, 64), said first linking means (82) operatively
connected to and extending between said first anchor (90a)

to and extending between said second anchor means (88a) on

said first control arm assembly (62) and said first anchor
means (90b) on said second control arm assembly (64), said

first and second linking means (62, 64) transferring a
force imposed on one of said control arm assemblies (62,

64) to the other of said control arm assemblies (64, 62);
