<ABSTRACT>
A system for monitoring personal safety in which polling calls 
are periodically generated (2) and transmitted (6) to individuals being 

monitored. The individual makes a polling response that should at 
least once include a voice message. This voice message should give an 

indication of the location of the individual concerned. If a polling 
response is not received following a predetermined number of polling 

calls which have been sent, then an alarm call is triggered. An alarm 
call is transmitted to a person who may render assistance to the person 

being monitored, the alarm call including at least the latest voice 
message (4) stored within the system from the person being monitored.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the monitoring of personal safety. 
More particularly, this invention relates to the monitoring of personal 
safety in situations where the persons concerned are widely dispersed. There is a need to monitor the safety of persons, particularly 
those working alone, because of increasing threats from hazardous 
working environments and possibly other people. There are two 
important requirements in a system that is to provide such protection: 
(i) a worker must be able to indicate that they are in need of 
attention or help; (ii) those needs and the location of the worker must 
swiftly and efficiently be communicated to the helpers. There are several existing systems that address these problems. 
One straightforward technique is for a supervisor to periodically 
contact each of the persons concerned to verify their safety. However, 
commercial pressures for efficiency increasingly preclude the use of 
personnel in such non-productive roles. Short range infra-red or radio detection and location beacons may 
be provided within a working site with associated transceivers carried 
by each person. This can provide an alarm signal from individuals and 
accurate and quick location of the personnel within the working site. 
However, the installation of such infra-red or radio detection and 
location beacons requires many such beacons to be provided, 
particularly on large sites, and this can be prohibitively expensive. Further techniques may be based upon radio triangulation of the 
GPS, Decca, Loran etc. types that provide position location over large 
and very large areas. However, these radio triangulation techniques 
tend to be expensive per individual due to the cost and complexity of 
the receivers involved and the commercially achievable positional 
accuracy of the location is often insufficient for the needs concerned. 
Radio triangulation using direction finding techniques and multiple 
base stations (e.g. multistation VDF) tends to be expensive, requires 
significant installation effort and frequently needs "tuning" to the 
individual installation. A personal safety monitoring system based upon radio pager 
technology is described in European Published Patent Application EP-A-0 
372 640 (Ericsson Paging Systems B.V.). In this system, each person  
 
being protected carries a portable paging receiver. A central base 
station periodically transmits to the paging receivers prompting the 
user to transmit a report signal indicative of the well being of the 
user. If no proper

Apparatus for monitoring personal safety comprising: 
   a polling call generator (2) for generating polling calls; 

   a polling call transmitter (6) for transmitting said polling 
calls to at least one person monitored; 

   a polling response receiver (6;14) for receiving at least voice 
message responses as polling responses from said at least one person; 

   a voice message store (4) for storing said voice message 
responses; 

   an alarm call generator (2) triggered when a polling response is 
not received from a given person to generate an alarm call including at 

least a latest voice message response from said given person stored 
within said voice message store (4); and 

   an alarm call transmitter (16) for transmitting said alarm call 
to a predetermined recipient (20). 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein said polling call 
generator (2) generates voice message calls. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1 and 2, wherein said 
polling call transmitter comprises one or more of: 


i) a radio paging transmitter (6); 
ii) a two-way radio transmitter; 
iii) an intercom station (12); and 
iv) means (16) for generating a telephone call. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 1, 2 and 3, wherein 
said polling response receiver comprises one or more of: 


i) a radio paging receiver (8); 
ii) a two-way radio receiver; and 
iii) a telephone receiver (14). 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said alarm call transmitter comprises one or more of:
 

i) a radio paging transmitter (6); 
ii) a two-way radio transmitter; 
iii) an intercom station (12); and 
iv) means (16) for generating a telephone call. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said polling call generator (2) generates said polling calls at user 

determined periodic intervals. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said polling call generator (2), said polling call transmitter (6) and 

said polling call receiver (6;14) act to transmit said polling call for 
a predetermined number of attempts prior to triggering said alarm call 

generator (16) if a polling response is not received. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said alarm call generator (2) and said alarm call transmitter (16) act 

to attempt to transmit said alarm call to a predetermined hierarchy of 
alarm call recipients (20) until an alarm call acknowledgement is 

received. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
upon receipt of an unsolicited polling response a next scheduled 

polling call to that person initiating said unsolicited polling 
response is deferred. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
a polling call includes a last received voice message response for that 

person, a non-voice message polling response to said polling call 
indicating said voice message response is to be maintained as current. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein 
said polling call generator (2) is responsive to a predetermined non-voice 

message response from a person monitored to alter polling call 
frequency for that person. 
A method of monitoring personal safety comprising the steps of: 
   generating polling calls; 

   transmitting said polling calls to at least one person monitored;
 

   receiving at least voice message responses as polling responses 
from said at least one person; 

   storing said voice message responses; 
   when a polling response is not received from a given person, 

generating an alarm call including at least a latest stored voice 
message response from said given person; and 

   transmitting said alarm call to a predetermined recipient.
