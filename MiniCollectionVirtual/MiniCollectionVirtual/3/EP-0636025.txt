<ABSTRACT>
Novel cyclohexanes of formulas (I) and (II) are described herein. They inhibit the production of Tumor Necrosis Factor and are useful in the treatment of disease states mediated or exacerbated by TNF production; these compounds are also useful in the mediation or inhibition of enzymatic or catalytic activity of phosphodiesterase IV.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions
containing these compounds, and their use in treating allergic and inflammatory diseases
and for inhibiting the production of Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF).Bronchial asthma is a complex, multifactorial disease characterized by reversible
narrowing of the airway and hyperreactivity of the respiratory tract to external stimuli.Identification of novel therapeutic agents for asthma is made difficult by the fact
that multiple mediators are responsible for the development of the disease. Thus, it seems
unlikely that eliminating the effects of a single mediator will have a substantial effect on
all three components of chronic asthma. An alternative to the "mediator approach" is to
regulate the activity of the cells responsible for the pathophysiology of the disease.One such way is by elevating levels of cAMP (adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate).
Cyclic AMP has been shown to be a second messenger mediating the
biologic responses to a wide range of hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs; [Krebs
Endocrinology Proceedings of the 4th International Congress Excerpta Medica, 17-29,
1973]. When the appropriate agonist binds to specific cell surface receptors, adenylate
cyclase is activated, which converts Mg+2-ATP to cAMP at an accelerated rate.Cyclic AMP modulates the activity of most, if not all, of the cells that contribute to
the pathophysiology of extrinsic (allergic) asthma. As such, an elevation of cAMP would
produce beneficial effects including: 1) airway smooth muscle relaxation, 2) inhibition of
mast cell mediator release, 3) suppression of neutrophil degranulation, 4) inhibition of
basophil degranulation, and 5) inhibition of monocyte and macrophage activation. Hence,
compounds that activate adenylate cyclase or inhibit phosphodiesterase should be effective
in suppressing the inappropriate activation of airway smooth muscle and a wide variety of
inflammatory cells. The principal cellular mechanism for the inactivation of cAMP is
hydrolysis of the 3'-phosphodiester bond by one or more of a family of isozymes referred
to as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs).It has now been shown that a distinct cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE)
isozyme, PDE IV, is responsible for cAMP breakdown in airway smooth muscle and
inflammatory cells. [Torphy, "Phosphodiesterase Isozymes: Potential Targets for Novel
Anti-asthmatic Agents" in New Drugs for Asthma, Barnes, ed. IBC Technical Services
Ltd., 1989]. Research indicates that
