<ABSTRACT>
This assembly (unit) including a support structure (1) which is fixed to the rest of the vehicle and on which there are fixed ends of a column body (2) in which body there is located a shaft (3), and means (8) for axial retraction of the body and therefore of the shaft in the event of an impact (shock) is characterised in that the means for retraction (8) comprise a force generator triggered by the impact, for moving the body (2) relative to the structure, including two parts which can move relative to one another, one of these parts (9), connected to the structure (1) and the other, (10), to the body, close to one of the ends of the latter, this end of the body being connected to the structure (1) by means which can be disengaged on the event of the generator being triggered, and including guide means designed to interact with complementary means on the structure (1), and in that the means for fastening the other end of the body to the structure (1) include a bearing for guiding this body.

Steering column unit axially retractable in the case of an impact, particularly 
for a car, of the type having a support structure (1) fixed to the 

remainder of the car and to which are fixed the ends of a steering column body 
(2), in which is placed a steering shaft (3), as well as means (8) for the 

axial retraction of the column body and therefore the steering shaft in the 
case of an impact, said retraction means (8) comprising an impact-tripped force 

generator, for the displacement of the body (2) relative to the support structure, 
said generator having two parts displaceable relative to one another, 

one (9) being connected to the support structure (1) and the other (10) to the 
body in the vicinity of one end thereof, said body end being connected to the 

support structure (1) by fixing means (20, 22) releasable during the tripping 
of the force generator, and incorporating guidance means (16, 17) for cooperating 

with complementary guidance means (18, 19) of the support structure (1), 
characterized in that the means for fixing the other end of the body to the 

support structure (1) comprise a flanged guide (22) for the same and that the 
steering column body (2) and the steering shaft (3) in each case have two 

mutually telescopic parts (30, 31, 32, 33). 
Unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the releasable fixing 
means comprise shearable bolts (20, 21). 
Unit according to claim 1, characterized in that the releasable fixing 
means comprise friction-based immobilizing means. 
Unit according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that 
the column body has a mounting fitting (13) with side wings (14, 15) provided 

with fixing means (20, 21) and guidance means (16, 17). 
Unit according to claim 4, characterized in that the guidance means of the 
body comprise guide pads (16, 17) of the lateral wings of the mounting fitting 

of the body, said pads cooperating with slides (18, 19) of the support structure. 
Unit according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that it 
has means for locking the body in the retracted position.
