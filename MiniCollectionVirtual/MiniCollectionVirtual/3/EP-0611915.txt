<ABSTRACT>
A method of covering a pipeline, which can be carried out 
either in the factory or in the field comprises enveloping the 

pipeline with a covering such as a helically wound tape (20) 
comprising a heat recoverable layer (21), having first surrounded 

the pipeline with a thermal barrier layer (such as a mastic 23) that 
bonds to the pipeline without the application of heat. A heat 

activatable adhesive (22) is used to bond the heat recoverable 
layer (21) to the thermal barrier layer. In the most preferred 

embodiment the thermal barrier layer and adhesive layer are pre-applied 
to the heat recoverable tape, and one edge (24) of the 

tape is bare of thermal barrier layer to allow good bonding 
between adjacent overlapping turns of the tape.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of providing a protective 
cover to an elongate substrate. particularly to pipe lines, or cables or 
connections between pipes or cables. Various coatings for such elongate substrates are known and 
many are commercially available. One class of coatings that has been 
found to be effective include the so-called fusion bonded epoxy 
coatings. These coatings are applied to the substrate in powdered 
form and are then heated to relatively high temperatures, about 
200° - 300°C, to cause the powder particles to fuse and flow together 
and cure to form a continuous coating bonded to the substrate. 
Typically, the substrate is preheated to these high temperatures 
before the powdered resin is applied. For good adhesion between 
the epoxy coating and the pipe, it is generally required that the 
surface of the pipe be adequately cleaned and abraded. The fusion 
bonded coating may be further protected by application of one or 
more additional layers. Coating systems of this type are disclosed in 
US Pat Nos. 4,213,486 to Samour and 4,510,007 to Stucke. A 
modification of this coating approach is disclosed in US Pat No. 
RE30,006 to Sakayori et al in which a modified polyolefin is applied 
to an uncured epoxy resin coated on a metal surface and then the 
system is heated to melt bond the uncured epoxy resin and the 
polyolefin and to cure the epoxy resin. The temperature utilised 
must be above the melting point of the polyolefin, generally between 
80° and 350°C.  Another coating technique is disclosed in US Pat No. 3,231,443 
to McNulty in which a cured resin layer (e.g. epoxy) carried on a film 
backing is applied over an uncured resin layer (e.g. epoxy) coated on 
the substrate to be protected. The cured and uncured resin interact 
to form a protective coating. It is said that the coating can be applied 
in the field. Cured epoxy resins are generally brittle and thus precuring 
the resin as suggested in McNulty is likely to be difficult 
under actual pipe installation conditions, particularly if the pipe is of 
relatively small diameter. Yet another approach to coating metal substrates is described 
in US Pat No. 3,502,492 to Spiller. In this approach a thin layer of 
powered epoxy resin is coated on the metal surface and then a thick 
layer of plasticized polyvinyl chloride particles are applied. The 
coating is heated causing both the epoxy powder and the polyvinyl 
chloride powder to adhere to each other and to the underlying 
substrate. A continuous epoxy-polyvinyl

A method of providing a protective covering to an elongate 
substrate comprising the steps of: 


(i) coating the substrate with a thermal barrier layer which 
is bondable to the substrate without the application of 

heat; 
(ii) enveloping the substrate and thermal barrier within a 
heat recoverable polymeric outer layer. 
(iii) providing a heat activatable adhesive layer between the 
thermal barrier layer and the outer layer; and 
(iv) applying heat to said layers to recover the heat
