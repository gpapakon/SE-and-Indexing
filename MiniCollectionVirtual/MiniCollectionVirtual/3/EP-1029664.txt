<ABSTRACT>
The neck ring (10h) includes and borders a recess (10g), containing central layer(s) (62). This layer (62) is bordered by an outer layer (10f) also extending into the recess.  Preferred features: Material is plasticized and injected into a first mold, forming a first, complete layer in the shape of the product. This layer is placed into a second mold (with its core), forming a second cavity. The second layer is injected-on. The preform is extracted. One of the injected materials forms a barrier layer. The outer layer (63) ends in the annular recess (10g), at the same time closing it (10g) outwardly. The central layer (62) of the three-layer article is a barrier layer. The neck ring (10h) is part of the first inner layer. In successive stages, this is externally covered-over near the base (10b) and intermediate region (10f), by further layers (62, 63). The layers (61, 62, 63) are formed by successive over-injection. The layer with the neck ring (10h) borders the following layers.
