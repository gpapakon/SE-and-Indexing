<ABSTRACT>
For utilising waste or residual materials (38, 25, 34) containing iron in the oxide form and/or iron in the metallic form and/or carbon, a process is used, by means of which molten crude iron (16) or steel initial products can be produced, iron ore (4) being reduced to sponge iron in a direct reduction zone (2), the sponge iron being melted into a melting gasification zone (15) with addition of carbonaceous material (29) and with gasification of the carbonaceous material (29) to give reduction gas, and the reduction gas being introduced into the direct reduction zone (2), being converted therein and being taken off as top gas. In order to be able to utilise the waste or residual materials completely and with saving of energy, the waste or residual materials (38,25,34) are collected separately in three groups according to their chemical composition, and in particular a first group contains materials (38) mainly containing iron in the oxide form, a second group contains materials (25) mainly containing iron in the metallic form, and a third group contains mainly carbonaceous materials (34), and the first group is fed to the direct reduction zone (2) and the second group as well as the third group are fed directly to the melting gasification zone (15).
