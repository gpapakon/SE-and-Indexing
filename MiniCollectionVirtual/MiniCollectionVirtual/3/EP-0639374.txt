<DESCRIPTION>
The active ingredients of this invention include (1-[2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)
ethyl] cyclohexanol), or therapeutically acceptable salts thereof,
which are known generally as venlafaxine and its analogues. Venlafaxine is disclosed in
U. S. Patent No. 4,535,186 (Husbands et al.) and has been previously reported to be
useful as an antidepressant. U. S. Patent No. 4,535,186 and US Patent 5,043,460 teach
the production of venlafaxine and its analogues and are incorporated herein as reference.
For the purposes of this disclosure, and the claims that follow, the use of venlafaxine is
understood to include the free base and pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of
venlafaxine, the racemate and its individual enantiomers, and venlafaxine analogs, both
as racemates and as their individual enantiomers.Venlafaxine has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of monoamine
neurotransmitter uptake, a mechanism associated with clinical antidepressant activity.
Due to its novel structure, venlafaxine has a mechanism of action unrelated to other
available antidepressants, such as the tricyclic antidepressants desipramine, nostriptyline,
protriptyline, imipramine, amitryptyline, trimipramine and doxepin.It is believed that venlafaxine's mechanism of action is related to potent
inhibition of the uptake of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin and
norepinephrine. To a lesser degree, venlafaxine also inhibits dopamine reuptake, but it
has no inhibitory activity on monoamine oxidase. O-desmethylvenlafaxine,
venlafaxine's major metabolite in humans, exhibits a similar pharmacologic profile.
Venlafaxine's ability to inhibit norepinephrine and serotonin (5-HT) uptake has been
predicted to have an efficacy which rivals or surpasses that of tricyclic antidepressants
(Stuart A. Montgomery, M.D., J. Clin. Psychiatry, 54:3, March 1993).In contrast to classical tricyclic antidepressant drugs, venlafaxine has
virtually no affinity for muscarinic, histaminergic or adrenergic receptors in vitro.
Pharmacologic activity at these receptors is associated with the various anticholinergic,
sedative and cardiovascular effects seen with the tricyclic antidepressant drugs. In accordance with the present invention there is provided use of a
compound of the invention (as hereinafter defined) to prepare a medicament for treating,
preventing, or controlling
generalized
anxiety disorder. The medicaments are indicated for use in
mammals, preferably in humans. This disorder exhibits a physiological basis
for treatment by venlafaxine's
