<ABSTRACT>
A light-tight optical disk cartridge (10) is disclosed for use with ETOM erasable and other optical disks (106) in which light baffles (202) incorporating a snap lock feature are utilized in the assembly of the optical disk cartridge in order to provide structural integrity to the cartridge as well as to prevent the entry of light into the cartridge. A snap close slide (103) and latching mechanism (800) is incorporated in order to prevent accidental opening of the access mechanism of the optical disk cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
 LIGHT-TIGHT OPTICAL DISK CARTRIDGEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to removable cartridges for carrying optical disks in which the cartridge can be readily inserted into an optical disk drive and be usable for all purposes as if the optical disk were fixed within the optical disk drive.More particularly, the present invention is directed to a light-tight optical disk cartridge designed to be used with optical media, such as electron trapping optical materials (ETOM) , which are light sensitive.Optical storage devices for use in storing computer and other data are well known in the art. Such devices are desirable because of their ability to store vastly more information per disk than known magnetic storage devices. While most of the known optical disk drive devices perform read-only functions, there are presently known write-once- read-many times (WORM) and erasable optical memory systems. All of the known (with the exception of the instant assignee) erasable optical storage device technologies involve techniques that require heat, which usually changes the physical or chemical structure of the materials in performing the write or erase function. In addition, performance of the media utilized with such approaches can easily be degraded over time due to the high sensitivity of the media to impurities, impurity diffusion, oxidation and other imperfections that propagate into defects which may only show up after multiple switching cycles or after the manufacturing and testing of the devices. 

 In order to overcome the problems of prior art erasable optical disk drives, the assignee of the present invention has developed a new approach to optical disk storage in which the optical storage materials which provide the storage function of the erasable optical disk drive utilize electron trapping optical materials. The electron trapping phenomenon is embodied by a class of materials which comprise an alkaline earth crystal typically doped with rare earth elements. Thin crystalline forms of such materials may be formed on various substrate structures, such as glass or aluminum, in order to provide the disk storage medium.Since the trapping phenomenon is a purely electronic process, read, write and erase operations can be performed in very short periods of time. In addition, the physical trapping phenomenon appears to offer a practically limitless media life.The materials which may be used as the media for the optical disk described herein are the subject of, for example.

<CLAIMS>
What is claimed is:
1. A removable optical disk cartridge for carrying an optical disk, said removable optical disk cartridge providing a light-tight environment for said optical disk.
2. A removable optical disk cartridge for providing a light-tight environment for an optical disk, comprising:
top and bottom disk cartridge portions secured together by a continuous light-tight seam structure?
an optical disk rotatably secured within said secured together top and bottom disk cartridge portions;
a slide rail having a top portion located on said top disk cartridge portion and a bottom portion located on said bottom disk cartridge portion; and
a slide movably secured to said top and bottom portions of said slide rail by an edge baffle structure.
3. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, further including means for preventing the opening of said slide when said removable optical disk cartridge is outside of an optical disk drive.
4. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, wherein said light-tight seam structure is comprised of an edge bead formed in one of said top and bottom disk cartridge portions and a receiving light baffle formed in the other of said top and bottom disk cartridge portions. 


 5. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 4, wherein said edge bead and said receiving light baffle snap securely together.
6. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, wherein said edge baffle structure is light-tight and wherein an edge of said slide fits snugly into a baffle formed as part of said slide rail to form at least one light-tight edge baffle structure which prevents light from penetrating into said removable optical disk cartridge when said slide is in a closed position.
7. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, wherein said slide, when in an open position, permits access to said optical disk by both a spindle drive mechanism and drive optics for operatively utilizing said optical disk.
8. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 1, wherein said optical disk is an ETOM optical disk.
9. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, wherein said optical disk is an ETOM optical disk.
10. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 3, wherein said means for preventing the opening of said slide comprises a slide latch assembly secured at a front end of said removable optical disk cartridge.
11. A method for providing a light-tight removable optical disk cartridge for an optical disk rotatingly secured within said disk cartridge, comprising the steps of: 


 assembling said cartridge from top and bottom disk cartridge portions using a continuous light-tight seam structure to secure together said top and bottom disk cartridge portions;
securing a top and a bottom slide rail respectively, to said top and bottom disk cartridge portions; and
slidably securing a slide to said top and bottom slide rails by means of a light-tight seam edge such that said light-tight seam edge and said top and bottom slide rails prevent any light from entering said light-tight removable optical disk cartridge.
12. The method of claim 11, further including the step of providing a slide latch mechanism to prevent the accidental opening of said slide.
13. The method of claim 11, further including the step of forming a continuous edge in one of said top and bottom disk cartridge portions and forming a corresponding continuous groove of light baffles in the other of said top and bottom disk cartridge portions for receiving said continuous edge.
14. The method of claim 11, wherein said seam edge and said light baffle snap together.
15. The method of claim 11, further including the step of providing at least one write protect tab for at 


least one side of said light-tight removable optical disk cartridge.
16. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, further including at least one write protect tab provided on at least one side of said optical disk cartridge.
17. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, wherein said edge baffle structure of said slide is light- tight and includes a soft snap mechanism for maintaining said slide in a closed position.
18. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, wherein said edge baffle structure of said slide is formed by a rounded edge on said slide meeting with a groove in said slide rail.
19. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 1, wherein said removable optical disk cartridge complies with ANSI standard X3B11/90-165.
20. The removable optical disk cartridge of claim 2, wherein said removable optical disk cartridge complies with ANSI standard X3B11/90-165.
