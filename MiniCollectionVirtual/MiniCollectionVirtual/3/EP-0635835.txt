<ABSTRACT>
A reproducing apparatus of a disc-shaped recording medium (1) has a head (3) a 
decoder (8), a memory (13), first and second expandor (14) and a controller(11). The 

disc-shaped recording medium includes a recording area in which only audio data or 
both of audio data and video data are recorded while intermixed with each other, a first 

management data area stored with first management data for controlling a recording or 
reproducing operation of the audio data for the recording area when only the audio data 

are recorded in or reproduced from the recording area, and a second management data 
area stored with second management data for controlling a recording or reproducing 

operation of the audio data for the recording area when both of the audio data and the 
video data are recorded in or reproduced from the recording area. The head (3) reads 

out data which are recorded on the disc-shaped recording medium with being 
compressed. The decoder (8) decodes the data read out by the head. The memory (13) 

temporarily stores audio data and video data read out from the decoder. The first 
expandor expands the audio data output from the memory. The second expandor 

expands the video data output from the memory. The controller (11) controls the 
reproducing operation of the recording medium by the head on the basis of the first and 

second management data read out by the head. If it is judged on the basis of the first 
management data read out by the head that the video data are recorded on the disc-shaped 

recording medium, on the basis of the second management data the controller 
controls the head to continuously read out a portion of the recording area of the 

recording medium in which the video data are recorded, and a portion of the recording 
area in which the audio data are recorded.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a recording medium, a recording and/or reproducing
apparatus for the recording medium, and a recording and/or reproducing method for the
recording medium, and particularly to a recording medium on which managing data for
managing data recorded in a recording area are recorded, a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus for the recording medium, and a recording and/or reproducing
method for the recording medium.A recording apparatus, a reproducing apparatus and a recording medium such as a
magneto-optical disc with which musical pieces and general data can be recorded and
reproduced have been practically used. Particularly, those magneto-optical discs which
enable an user to not only reproduce information therefrom, but also record sounds
such as music, etc. thereon have been recently made public.A recording and/or reproducing apparatus using such a magneto-optical disc has
been generally used to record/reproduce audio signals of music, etc., and this type of
recording and/or reproducing apparatus is expected to enable an user to
record/reproduce video (image) data in synchronism with sounds such as music, etc.If video data are also considered to be recorded and/or reproduced together with
audio data using a recording and/or reproducing apparatus which is originally developed
for recording and reproduction of sounds (audio data), there would occur a problem that
it is difficult to keep compatibility with a recording medium on which only audio data
are recorded. That is, not only a system which is capable of recording and reproducing
both of pictures (images) and music is merely provided, but also it is required to keep
such compatibility that, for a recording medium on which video data are newly
recorded, only audio data are recordable/reproducible using a recording and/or
reproducing apparatus for ordinary magneto-optical discs to enjoy music, etc. while
both of audio data and video data can be simultaneously reproduced using a recording
and/or reproducing apparatus having a video input and output function to enjoy both of
pictures and music like a Karaoke with pictures or a video equipment.Further, in this type of recording and/or reproducing apparatus, there is a case
where no reproduction can be performed by any one other than special persons, for
example, when high secrecy is required for recorded data. In some cases, it is required 
that prescribed video or audio data can be reproduced by only those persons who know
identification numbers for these data.EP-A-0 165 320

<CLAIMS>
A recording medium (1) comprising:

a recording area in which only audio data or both of audio data and video data are
recorded,

a first management data area stored with first management data for controlling a
recording or reproducing operation of the audio data for said recording area when only

the audio data are recorded in or reproduced from said recording area; and

a second management data area stored with second management data for controlling a
recording or reproducing operation of the audio data and the video data for said

recording area when both of the audio data and the video data are recorded in or
reproduced from said recording area,

characterized in,

that said first management data comprise a defect pointer for indicating said video data
as being stored in defective segments, so that said video data are managed as

unrecordable/unreproducible data, when only said audio data are recorded in or
reproduced from said recording area.
The recording medium according to claim 1,

characterized in,

that said first management data area is stored with identification data indicating an use
status of said second management data area.
The recording medium according to claims 1 or 2,

characterized in,

that said first management data area and said second management data area are recorded
at an upstream side of a recording start end of said recording area.
The recording medium according to claim 1, 2 or 3,

characterized in,

that said audio data are compressed audio data and said video data are compressed video
data.
A recording and/or reproducing apparatus for a recording medium (1), according to
one of the preceding claims, said apparatus comprising:

a first compandor (14) for compressing input audio data and expanding audio data read
out from a recording medium;

a second compandor for compressing input video data and expanding video data read
out from the recording medium;
 
storing means (13, 23) for temporarily storing the audio data and the video data output

from said first (14) and second compandors (21) and temporarily storing the audio data
