<ABSTRACT>
A method of producing a gel material and which comprises firstly providing an aqueous soluble hemicellulosic starting medium which is free of glucans and obtainable from testaceous plant material. The starting medium is then extracted with a non-acidic reagent and reacted with an oxidising system comprising at least one peroxide, together with at least one oxygenase (such as a peroxidase). A gel material which is obtainable from a hemicellulosic starting medium, and which is substantially free of glucans and pectins. The gel material comprises a polysaccharide network for a matrix of polysaccharide chain segments and a multiplicity of cross-linking ferulate bridges. The ferulate bridges are located at regular intervals along the cross-linked segments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a food ingredient comprising gels prepared from plant
matter.Large numbers of plant sources contain hemicelluloses, which are composed
of various arrangements of pentoses (such as xylose and arabinose), hexoses (such
as mannose, glucose and galactose) and/or uronic acids (such as glucuronic and
galacturonic acid). Examples of hemicellulosic materials include xylans (such as
arabinoxylan), mannans and galactans, which may be substituted by phenolic acid
residues such as ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid), coumaric acid
(p-hydroxycinnamic acid) or vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxyl benzoic acid). Such
materials occur naturally in cereals such as maize, barley (including malted barley),
wheat, oats and rice; pulses, such as soya; legumes and fruit.French patent specification 2545101 is concerned with modification of sugar
beet pectins by reacting an oxidising system comprising an enzyme (such as
peroxidase) and an oxidising agent (such as hydrogen peroxide) with pectins which
have been isolated from sugar beet. The isolation of pectin comprises subjecting
the sugar beet to acidic extraction and heat treatment.Geissmann & Neukom in Lebensmittel-Wiss.U.Technol., 6(2), 1973, 59-62
describe the separation of water-insoluble pentosans from wheat flour and the
subsequent oxidative gelation of an arabinoxylan containing fraction.Michniewicz et al inCerealChemistry, 67(5), 1990, 434-439 also describe
the isolation of water-insoluble pentosans from wheat flour and the subsequent
gelation using horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide.According to the present invention, there is provided a method of producing
a gel material, which method comprises:
(a) providing an aqueous soluble hemicellulosic starting medium which is
substantially free of glucans and is obtainable from testaceous plant
material;(b) extracting said starting medium with a non-acidic aqueous reagent; and(c) reacting the extracted material with an oxidising system comprising at least
one peroxide, together with at least one oxygenase (such as a peroxidase).The soluble hemicellulosic starting medium is typically prepared from waste
testaceous plant material containing a significant quantity (such as at least about 10%, such
as about 20%) of arabinoxylan or glucuronoarabinoxylan, which is present in nature
primarily in the cell wall regions. Examples of preferred such sources include waste
materials which are rich in cell walls, such as cereal husk or bran, or legumes (pulses).
