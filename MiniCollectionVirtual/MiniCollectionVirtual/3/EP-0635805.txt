<ABSTRACT>
Method for processing digitised pictures in angiographic imaging for the automatic detection of stenoses comprising at least one step of identifying pixels or points situated on the central lines of vessels, termed the "tracking" step. This method is characterised in that it comprises, next, a step of detecting stenoses by measuring the intensities of the pixels along the central lines of the vessels, this step comprising a sub-step of deciding that a zone of pixels is a potential stenosis zone when the intensity of its pixels undergoes a local variation, taking a value intermediate between the intensity of the pixels either side of this zone, and the intensity of the pixels of the background of the picture; a sub-step of delimiting an "icon" around the potential stenoses zones; and a sub-step of extracting the edge pixels of the vessels in the "icons". Application: digitized angiograph systems.

A method for the processing of digital angiographic images for automatic
detection of stenoses, comprising at least a step Fig. 4a for the identification of pixels or

points situated on the central lines of vessels, which step is referred to as a tracking step,

characterized in that
 it subsequently comprises a step Fig. 4B for the detection of stenoses
by measurement of the intensities of pixels along the central lines of the vessels, which step

comprises a sub-step for deciding whether a pixel zone is a potential stenosis zone when the
intensity of its pixels exhibits a local variation so as to assume an intermediate value

between the intensity of the pixels to both sides of this zone and the intensity of the pixels
of the background of the image, a sub-step Fig. 5A for defining an icon around potential

stenosis zones, and a sub-step for the extraction of the pixels of edges of the vessels in the
icons, 
characterised in that
 it also comprises a step Fig. 5B for determining the seriousness
of the stenoses and for determining false alarms, which method is carried out by a neural

network which supplies, for each potential stenosis, the probability that it concerns a real
stenosis or a false alarm.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the pixels of the edges
of the vessels are extracted by a method for correlating intensity profiles perpendicularly to

the axis of the central line of the vessel in the icon with crenellations.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 in the icon the edges
of the vessel which correspond to each point of the central line are determined as the points

of inflection of the corresponding intensity profile, perpendicularly to the central line of the
vessel, by calculation of the derivative of this intensity profile.
A method as claimed in one of the preceding Claims, 
characterized in that

the tracking step is preceded by a step during which the background is extracted so as to
produce the image of the vessels as contrasting objects on a substantially uniform

background.
