<ABSTRACT>
A two-phase composite of ionically-conductive pressure-sensitive adhesive (14, 36), biomedical electrodes (10, 30) using the composite and methods of preparing the composite and the electrode are disclosed. The continuous phase is a hydrophilic, solid state pressure-sensitive adhesive composition ionically-conductive regardless of an amount of water present in the composition. The discontinuous phase are domains of a hydrophilic pressure-sensitive adhesive which enhances adhesion of the composite to mammalian skin while maintaining acceptable alternating current impedance of the composite.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to composites of a continuous 
phase of an ionically-conductive, hydrophilic, solid state, 
pressure-sensitive adhesive having domains of hydrophobic, pressure-sensitive 
adhesive dispersed therein. This invention also relates 
to biomedical electrodes using such composites as a ionically-conductive 
medium, and methods of preparing such composites and 
electrodes. Modern medicine uses many medical procedures where electrical 
signals or currents are received from or delivered to a patient's 
body. The interface between medical equipment used in these 
procedures and the skin of the patient is usually some sort of 
biomedical electrode. Such an electrode typically includes a 
conductor which must be connected electrically to the equipment, and 
a conductive medium adhered to or otherwise contacting skin of a 
patient. Among the therapeutic procedures using biomedical electrodes 
are transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS) devices used 
for pain management; neuromuscular stimulation (NMS) used for 
treating conditions such as scoliosis; defibrillation electrodes to 
dispense electrical energy to a chest cavity of a mammalian patient 
to defibrillate heart beats of the patient; and dispersive 
electrodes to receive electrical 
energy dispensed into an incision made during electrosurgery. Among diagnostic procedures using biomedical electrodes are 
monitors of electrical output from body functions, such as 
electrocardiogram (ECG) for monitoring heart activity and for 
diagnosing heart abnormalities.  
 For each diagnostic, therapeutic, or electrosurgical 
procedure, at least one biomedical electrode having an ionically 
conductive medium containing an electrolyte is adhered to or 
otherwise contacting mammalian skin at a location of interest and 
also electrically connected to electrical diagnostic, therapeutic, 
or electrosurgical equipment. A critical component of the 
biomedical electrode is the conductive medium serving as the 
interface between mammalian skin and diagnostic, therapeutic, or 
electrosurgical equipment. Biomedical electrodes are used among other purposes to 
monitor and diagnose a patient's cardiovascular activity. 
Diagnostic electrodes are used to monitor the patient immediately 
and are only applied to the patient for about five to ten minutes. 
Monitoring electrodes are used on patients in intensive care for up 
to three days continuously. Holter electrodes are used to monitor a 
patient during strenuous and daily activities. All of these
