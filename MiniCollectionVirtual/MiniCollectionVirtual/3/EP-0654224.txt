<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for treating at least one strip of filter material for the tobacco-processing industry, which is extracted from a stock and which is fed to a stretching stage having a stretching means which is followed by an applicator stage with an applicator means for applying application fluid, etching the filter material, onto the strip, which applicator stage, in turn, is followed by a gathering stage having a gathering means reducing the width of the strip. The purpose of the invention is to achieve a further possibility for the treatment of filter material. In the solution according to the invention, the stretching stage, the applicator stage and the gathering stage form at least approximately the shape of a U or V. The advantage attainable by means of the invention is an improvement in the tow yield along with a constant pull resistance of the filter sticks produced from the treated material. Moreover, a reduction in the dimensions of a corresponding treatment apparatus is achieved.

<CLAIMS>
An arrangement for the preparation of at least one strip (2) of
filter material for the tobacco-processing industry, the strip (2)

being taken from a supply (1) and fed to a stretching section
comprising a stretching device (24, 39), downstream of which is

arranged a coating section (7) comprising a coating device (48) for
the application, to the strip (2d), of a coating fluid which starts to

dissolve the filter material, downstream of which is in turn
arranged a gathering section (8) comprising a gathering device

(56a ... 56c) which reduces the width of the strip (2e),
characterised in that the stretching section, the coating section

and the gathering section at least approximately form the shape
of a U or a V.
An arrangement according to claim 1, characterised in that the
length of the stretching section (6) comprising the stretching

device (24, 39), which preferably consists of at least two pairs of
rollers driven at different speeds, is between 800 mm and

1200 mm, preferably approximately 1000 mm.
An arrangement according to claim 2, characterised in that the
width of the strip (2c, 2d) in the stretching section (6) and the

coating section (7) is between 120 mm and 150 mm.
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the stretching section (6) is arranged at least 

approximately vertically or with a predominantly vertical
component, and the strip (2c) preferably has a downwards feed

direction (36).
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that, when the stretching section (6), coating

section (7) and gathering section (8) form the shape of a V, the
stretching section with the downwards feed direction (36) forms

one arm of the V, while the coating section and the directly
adjacent gathering section with the upwards feed direction (47,

54) form the other arm.
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the coating device (47) in the coating section

(7) is formed as a spray device (48) applying the coating fluid in
the form of finely dispersed droplets from both sides.
An arrangement according to claim 6, characterised by guiding of
the strip (2d) in the region of the coating section (7), in which the

tension of the strip relative to the stretching section (6) is
reduced.
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the gathering section (8) is arranged at least

approximately vertically or with a predominantly vertical
component, and the strip (2e) preferably has an upwards feed

direction (54). 
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the stretching section (6) and the gathering

section (7) are at least approximately the same length.
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a pre-stretching section (4) is arranged

upstream of the stretching section (6).
An arrangement according to claim 10, characterised in that the
strip (2b) preferably has a downwards feed direction (28) in the

pre-stretching section (4) with a horizontal and a vertical feed
component.
An arrangement according to claim 10 and/or 11, characterised
in that a conditioning device (29) for conditioning the strip (2b) to

an at least approximately constant relative moisture content is
arranged on the path of the pre-stretching section (4).
An arrangement according to claim 12, characterised in that the
conditioning device has a controllable drying device (31).
An arrangement according to claim 13, characterised in that the
drying device (31) has an infra-red heater for drying the strip (2b).
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the pre-stretching section (4) is formed by a

pair (21) of rollers arranged upstream and a further, driven pair
(24) of rollers which, viewed in the feed direction of the strip (2b),

is the first pair of rollers of the stretching section (6). 
An arrangement according to claim 15, characterised in that the
pair (21) of rollers arranged upstream is non-driven.
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that at least one spreading nozzle (16) is

arranged downstream of the supply (1) and emits air which
spreads out the strip (2a).
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the pairs (24, 39, 43, 51) of rollers of the

stretching section (6), coating section (7) and gathering section (8)
each comprise a roller with a smooth, resilient surface and a

roller with a rigid, grooved surface.
An arrangement according to one or more of the preceding claims,
characterised in that a charging device (37) for applying

electrostatic charges to the strip (2b) is arranged upstream of the
coating device (47).
An arrangement according to claim 19, characterised in that a
