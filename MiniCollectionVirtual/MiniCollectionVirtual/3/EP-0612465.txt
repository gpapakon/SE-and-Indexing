<ABSTRACT>
The invention carries out a cutter-mixer-feeder for fodder 
and grass or straw materials which includes a container (2) 

with at least one opening (3) for introducing the material 
(23) to be processed and at least one door (24) for discharging 

the processed material; inside the container there 
is at least one screw feeder (7), placed at the bottom 

(76) of said container (2) and provided with at least a 
pair of spirals (9, 10), one of which is rolled up clockwise, 

while the other counterclockwise. In the substantially 
central area of the screw feeder where said spirals (9, 

10) meet, they set out a discoidal element (16) consisting 
of a right half spiral (162) and a left half spiral (161), 

each of which has at least one outlet (260) which is obtained 
by taking away a part of the half spiral itself.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention is a wagon particularly suitable for cutting 
and mixing long-fibre products, such as fodder and grass or 
straw materials, made up in bales or in their natural 
state; it is provided with screw feeders which have been 
perfected in the profile of their central part. The US-A-4,344,580 discloses an apparatus for dispensing 
fibrous materials provided with at least one auger disc 
consisting of a sliced and spread disc having a toothed 
edge. This apparatus is particularly used for dispensing 
and regulating the mouvement of this fibrous materials. The wagons of the known kind are generally made up of a 
container, inside which, there are one or more screw feeders, 
placed partly in the lower area of the container and 
partly in its upper area. Such wagons are especially suitable for cutting and mixing 
short-fibre products and present great difficulties in 
cutting long-fibre products, such as fodder or straw or 
grass materials, particularly when great quantities are involved. As a matter of fact, while cutting or mixing long-fibre 
products the screw feeders placed in the upper part have a 
tendency easily clog up to quite, since the material gets 
entangled around them and prevents or even stops the rotation. 
Often it can go so far as to even bend the screw 
feeder. The same problem, even if to a lesser extent, arises also 
with the lower screw feeders. Furthermore, said operation of cutting becomes impossible 
when fodder is made up in bales. It is to find a solution for such difficulties that the 
inventor has carried out the perfected cutter-mixer-feeder 
wagon which is the object of the WO 93/00799, showing the features 
of the preamble of claim 1;  
 
Such a cutter mixer is provided with two screw 
feeders with opposing spirals placed at the bottom of the 
wagon and, in the area where said spirals converge, each 
shows a diaphragm which is orthogonal to the longitudinal 
axis of the screw feeder and consists of two truncated  
 
cone-shaped surfaces united in correspondence with their 
greater base and converging towards the ends of each screw 
feeder. The screw feeders carried out following such a criterion 
considerably improve the operations of cutting and mixing 
the product, but still they are not the best solution to 
avoid clogs. Moreover, they do not ensure that the product is cut regularly 
enough with a steady absorption of power. It is to further improve the performance level in cutting, 
mixing and distributing the product that the wagon equipped 
with screw feeders

<CLAIMS>
Cutter-mixer-feeder wagon for fodder and grass or 
straw materials comprising: 


a container (2) provided with at least one opening (3) 
for introducing the material (23) to be processed and at 

least one door (24) for discharging the material processed; 
at least one screw feeder (7), placed inside a compartment 
with curved profile (75) obtained at the bottom (76) 

of the container (2) and provided with at least a pair of 
spirals (9, 10) on which cutters (13) are fixed peripheral, 

one of said spirals being rolled up clockwise and the other 
counterclockwise starting from the ends of the screw feeder 

and being such that they convey the processed material 
towards the central part of said screw feeder, characterized 

in that 
a central element (16) consisting of a right half spiral (162) 

and a left half spiral (161), each being joined to the other at 
both ends, is provided 

in the area substantially central of the screw 
feeder, 

each of said half 
spirals showing at least one outlet (260) obtained by 

taking away a part of the half spiral, each outlet (260) 
showing the sides (261) of its profile being substantially 

orthogonal to each other. 
Cutter-mixer-feeder wagon according to claim 1), 
characterized in that said central element (16) has the 

right half spiral (162) that makes it up faced to the final 
part (109) of the left spiral (9) of the screw feeder and 

the left half spiral (161) faced to the final part (110) of 
the right spiral (10) of said screw feeder, each of said 

final parts of said spirals of the screw feeder showing at 
least one outlet (209, 210) obtained by taking away a part 

of the spiral and arranged so as not to coincide with any 
of the outlets (260) made in the central element (16). 
Cutter-mixer-feeder wagon according to claim 1) or 
2), characterized in that the central element (16) shows 

two outlets (260), one opposite to the other in a substantially  
 

radial direction with respect to the screw feeder. 
Cutter-mixer-feeder wagon according to claim 3), 
characterized in that said two outlets (260) are arranged 

at an angle of 180, one with respect to the other. 
Cutter-mixer-feeder wagon according to claim 1), 
characterized in that the screw feeders (7) are two, are 

placed parallel to each other and have between them and in 
correspondence with their central part a pair of directional 

blades (80) fixed at the bottom (76) of the container 
(2); these blades are axially spaced out and inclined in 

the rotation sense (70) of the screw feeders (7). 
Cutter-mixer-feeder wagon according to claim 2), 
characterized in that between the final part (109, 110) of 

each spiral (9, 10) and the corresponding half spiral (162, 
161) belonging to the central element (16), at least a 

drag blade (90) is placed, made up of a shaped wall fixed 
to the screw feeder and placed in a longitudinal direction 

which is substantially parallel to the axis of said screw 
feeder. 
Cutter-mixer-feeder wagon according to claim 1), 
characterized in that inside the container (2) and in 

correspondence with the central area of the screw feeders 
(7) there is a deflector (29) applied to a side wall (27)
