<ABSTRACT>
An inference device for discriminating an earthquake 
includes an ON/OFF signal generating means for generating an 

ON/OFF signal corresponding to an oscillatory wave, a 
characteristic parameter extracting means for extracting at 

least one of three characteristic parameters consisting of an 
ON period, an ON time sum total and a maximum ON time value 

based on the generated ON/OFF signal, and an inference means 
for inferring for each ON period based on the extracted 

characteristic parameter whether or not an earthquake happens.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an inference device for
discriminating a predetermined shock, and more particularly to
an improved device for discriminating a certain oscillation
which is suitable for a unit to be installed within a gas
meter for home use so as to cut off the supply of gas on
occurrence of the earthquake.There is well known a device for measuring ON/OFF signals
generated from a sensor or a seismoscope housed within a gas
meter for a predetermined time period and for detecting a
certain oscillation such as an earthquake when the measured
signals reach a predetermined condition.Such a conventional device is designed to store ON/OFF
signal data generated from the seismoscope for the
predetermined time period, for example, three seconds, and to
execute such discrimination based on the stored data, so that
the discrimination cannot be initiated until the predetermined
time period for data storage has elapsed.From Proceedings of Tencon 87, V.2 of 3, 1987, pp.
492-496 it is known to discriminate an earthquake from other
mechanical oscillations by analyzing mechanical oscillation
signals on the basis of parameters stored in a data base.Fuzzy classification in seismics is known from Proceedings
of SPIE, V.1709, April 1992, pp. 950-958.Three-level quantization in the context of random signal
seismology is known from IEEE Transactions on Sonics
and Ultrasonics, V. SU-23, No. 2, March 1976, pp. 107-112.It is, therefore, a primary object of this invention to
provide an inference device for discriminating a shock or an
earthquake at a high speed with reducing erroneous
discrimination.According to this invention, there is provided an  
inference device as defined in claim 1.Thus, the device infers the existence of
a certain mechanical oscillation such as
an earthquake
based on at least one of the three parameters of an ON period,
an ON time sum total and a maximum ON time value for each ON
period, in other words, based on data generated from a time
point when the first ON signal is applied for each entry of
the ON signal, so that the inference by this device is
executed at a higher speed than a conventional method in which
discrimination is executed after storing ON/OFF signal data
for a predetermined time period. Moreover, the device
processing the ON period corresponding to an oscillatory
period as a characteristic parameter can fairly decrease
erroneous discrimination by other shock than earthquake.A better understanding of this invention may be had from
a consideration of the following detailed
