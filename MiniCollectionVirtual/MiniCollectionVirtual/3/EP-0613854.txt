<ABSTRACT>
A rotating filling unit (1) for metering out drinks into containers (3) has a multiplicity of circulating container points (2) which are positioned at intervals around its circumference and have gauging containers (53) which can be filled up from a drink reservoir (58) and from which gauging containers (53) the drink runs into the drinks containers, the said unit (1) having control devices which control the quantity discharged via level detection in the gauging containers being characterised in that the gauging containers are transparent and in that at least one video camera (60, 67), which is fixedly mounted and observes the gauging containers of a plurality of adjacent container points, is provided, as is an image evaluating device (18) which has devices for tracking and monitoring the gauging containers within the field of observation of the camera while determining the levels (62) in the latter at different angular positions, devices for determining the container positions recorded and devices for emitting control signals for remote control valves (55, 57) at the container points determined, a camera (60) which observes the region at which filling ceases being used to control a filling valve (57) and/or a camera (67) which observes the region at which discharging ceases being used to control a discharging valve (55).

Rotating beverage filling machine for volumetrically 
filling containers with beverages with a plurality 

of rotating container stations spaced over its 
periphery with metering containers which may be 

refilled from a beverage supply and from which the 
beverage drains into the beverage containers and 

with control devices which control the drain volume 
by way of level recognition in the metering 

containers, characterised in that the metering 
containers (53) are of transparent construction and 

that at least one stationarily arranged video camera 
(60, 67) is provided which views the metering 

containers (53) of a plurality of adjacent container 
stations (2), and an image analysing device (18) 

with devices for tracking monitoring the metering 
containers (53) in the field of view of the camera 

(60, 67) whilst determining the levels (62) in them 
at different angular positions, for determining the 

viewed container stations (2) and for issuing 
control signals for remote controllable valves (55, 

57) at the determined container stations (2), 
whereby one camera (60) viewing the region of the 

filling stop point serves to control a filling valve 
(57) and/or one camera (67) viewing the region of 

the draining stop point serves to control a drain 
valve (55). 
Beverage filling machine as claimed in Claim 1, 
characterised in that the image analysing device 

(18) detects at least one level (66) reached before 
the stop level (O, U) to issue throttling signals.  

 
Beverage filling apparatus as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the image 

analysing device (18) determines the angular 
position (65) when the stop level (O, U) is reached 

in the metering containers (53) and adjusts the 
starting angle of the refilling sector (A) or the 

filling sector (F) in dependence on it. 
Beverage filling apparatus as claimed in Claim 3, 
characterised in that the angular positions 

associated with individual container stations (2) 
when a stop level (O, U) is reached are determined 

and individual start signals are issued in 
dependence on them for t
he refilling and/or draining 
operation to the associated container stations on 

the next rotation of the filler (1). 
Beverage filling apparatus as claimed in one of 
Claims 3 or 4, characterised in that the control of 

the initiation of the refilling or draining process 
is effected such that the atop level (O, U) is 

reached at the end of the respective operational 
sector (A, F). 
Beverage filling apparatus as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that devices are 

provided for continuously determining the angular 
position of the filler (1) and for transferring it 

to the image analysing device (18). 
Beverage filling apparatus as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the image 

analysing device (18) detects container stations (2) 
lying outside the normal range as regards the  

 
determined filling parameters. 
Beverage filling apparatus as claimed in one of the 
preceding claims, characterised in that the metering 

containers (53') have a reduced cross-section in the 
region (69) of a stop level (U) to be detected.
