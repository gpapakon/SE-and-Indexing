<ABSTRACT>
Self-aligned monolithic solid-state microlaser with passive Q-switching by saturable absorber and its method of manufacture. This laser cavity for a microlaser includes a solid active medium (8), a saturable absorber (12, 22), an input mirror (13) and an output mirror (15), and is characterized in that the saturable absorber is a thin film of saturable absorbent material deposited directly onto the solid active medium.
