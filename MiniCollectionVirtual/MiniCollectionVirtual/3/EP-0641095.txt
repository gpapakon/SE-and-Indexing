<ABSTRACT>
A communication apparatus which can communicate by 
a proper light intensity and can prevent a vain 

electric power consumption without providing light 
intensity measuring means on the reception side is 

provided. There are also provided communication 
apparatus and method, in which after a CPU issued a 

first message, a light emission intensity of an 
infrared LED is changed by the CPU so as to become the 

optimum state in accordance with the presence or 
absence of the response of a second message that is 

performed in response to the first message.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a communication apparatus
for communicating by using a light.In recent years, a communication apparatus for
communicating by using a light has widely been put into
practical use. There are various kinds of
communication apparatuses such as apparatus using a
spatial transmission, apparatus using an optical fiber,
apparatus for communicating by coming into contact with
another apparatus, and the like.In such conventional communication apparatuses, a
light emitting device is driven by a predetermined
light intensity (at least, in terms of an assumption
such that the light intensity cannot be purposely
changed) irrespective of a type of transmission path.The light intensity is set to an intensity enough
to assure the communication at the time of the maximum
attenuation on the transmission path (for instance, in
case of the apparatus using the optical fiber, the
maximum length; in case of the apparatus for performing
the spatial transmission, the maximum distance).A light emitting device (light emitting diode, 
laser diode, or the like) which is used for light
communication is driven by a current of about tens of
mA to 150 mA. However, since a low electric power
consumption of an electronic apparatus is progressively
realized nowadays, there is a tendency such that a
ratio at which the electric power consumption of the
light emitting device occupies in the electric power
consumption of the whole apparatus is increasing.
Therefore, as in the foregoing conventional
apparatuses, a method whereby the light emitting device
is always driven by the light intensity corresponding
to the maximum attenuation is very disadvantageous from
a viewpoint of the realization of a low electric power
consumption.In case of the apparatus for communicating by
coming into contact with another apparatus, an interval
between the light emitting device and the
photosensitive device is set to a predetermined
distance and no problem occurs even if the light
intensity is inherently set to a fixed value. However,
in many cases, the light intensity is set to a slightly
strong value in order to cope with a variation among
devices, a deviation of the light axis at the time of
installation, or the like. The apparatus is also not
driven by the optimum light intensity.To solve the above problems, there is considered a
method whereby light intensity measuring means for 
measuring the light intensity is provided on the
photosensitive device side and the measurement result
of the light intensity measuring means is fed back
