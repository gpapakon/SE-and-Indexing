<ABSTRACT>
System for supplying a vehicle internal combustion engine with combustion (oxidising) gas, comprising an inlet butterfly valve (1) mounted so that it can move in terms of displacement in an inlet pipe (2) under the action of a mechanical operating member (10-12) and of a movement-regulating motor (5) in which the butterfly valve (1) is secured, in terms of displacement, to the shaft (4) of the motor (5) and the motor (5) is secured in terms of displacement to the operating member (10-12).

Combustion gas supply system for an internal combustion
engine of a vehicle, comprising, in an inlet manifold (2), an

inlet butterfly-valve (1) moving integrally with a shaft (4) of
a regulating motor (5) in turn moving integrally with a

mechanical control member (10-12) and means (8) for determining
the movement of the motor (5), with respect to an inoperative

position, under the action of the control member (10-12), the
mechanical control member (10-12) directly controlling the

movement of the motor (5), characterised by the fact that a
microprocessor (7) is provided for cyclically comparing the

movement of the motor (5) with a movement threshold (DO) of its
shaft (4) and of the butterfly valve (1) in
 a given space of time
(TO) and thus to control the movement of the shaft (4) of the

motor (5) and thus of the butterfly valve (1) in order to limit
the speed of movement of the shaft (4) by controlling a

complementary and progressive movement of the latter.
Supply system according to Claim 1, in which a travel-limitation
indicator (15), integral with the shaft (4) of the

regulating motor (5), is arranged to move between two stops (16-17)
of the casing (6) of the regulating motor (5).
Supply system according to one of Claims 1 and 2, in which
the regulating motor (5) is rotary.
Supply system according to one of Claims 1 to 3, in which
the regulating motor (5) is a stepping motor.
