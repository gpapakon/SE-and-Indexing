<ABSTRACT>
The arc welding torch for welding under protective gas is provided with a contact tip (1) which is fastened to a receptacle (2) forming the end of a tubular cooling body (3, 4) and having an annular coolant passage (5) for carrying away the welding heat. In its end facing the receptacle, the contact tip has a fastening bore whose side walls surround on the outside the receptacle section containing the annular coolant passage. To fasten those components which are subjected to especially high thermal stress, namely the contact tip and possibly a wear insert (10) and the gas nozzle (16), a special rotary taper is provided. This rotary taper is formed by spiral segmental surfaces (7, 8 and 14, 15 or 20, 21) between the corresponding components to be connected to one another. These spiral segmental surfaces permit easy and releasable connection of the corresponding components, for example between the contact tip (1) and the receptacle (2), in which case contact over a large area takes place at the same time, which provides for good heat conduction.
