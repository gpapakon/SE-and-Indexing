<ABSTRACT>
Owing to the fact that sheet edges (3.1, 3.2) to be welded according to the invention are preheated before they are welded, a smaller temperature gradient arises in the material to be welded at the same welding speed during the welding. Consequently, the welding speed can be increased or material which gives poor welding quality at a high temperature gradient can be welded. The preheating is realised, for example, by excitation of the material to be welded at a high frequency.

<CLAIMS>
Method for welding sheet edges (3.1, 3.2), in particular for welding flat
sheet-metal parts into composite panels, or two edges of a rounded blank (3) to produce

a container body, the two edges for welding being positioned relative to each other and
led to a welding station by guide means (1) and welded to each other in the welding

station, the sheet edges (3.1, 3.2) for welding being preheated prior to welding,

characterized in that
 the guide means are formed by a Z-rail (2), and at least the sheet
edges (3.1, 3.2) being guided in the Z-rail (2) are preheated therein by preheating

means.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the sheet edges for
welding are preheated through excitation by high frequency.
Method according to Claim 1, 
characterized in that
 the edges for
welding are preheated by a focused laser beam (9).
Method according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that

the preheating is rated so that the sheet edges for welding already contain 5 to 40 % of
welding energy immediately before welding.
Method according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that
 the
preheating is rated so that the sheet edges for welding already contain 10 to 15 % of

welding energy immediately before welding. 
Method according to any one of Claims 1, 2 or 5, 
characterized in that

the sheet edges for welding consist of sheet steel, and 
in that
 they are preheated to 100
to 600 Â°C.
Apparatus for carrying out the method according to any one of Claims
1 to 6, the said apparatus having a welding station and guide means (1) and a drive

arrangement by means of which the edges (3.1, 3.2) for welding are positionable relative
to each other and drivable into the welding station, the apparatus additionally having, in

front of the welding station in the direction of travel of the sheet edges for welding,
preheating means (4/5, 9) by means of which the edges for welding are preheatable

prior to welding, 
characterized in that
 the guide means (1) are a Z-shaped rail with a
guide groove (1.1, 1.2) for each of the two edges (3.1, 3.2) for welding, and 
in that
 at
least parts of the preheating means (3, 4) are arranged in the region of this rail.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the preheating
means have a high-frequency coil (4) which is accommodated in a carrier block (5)

mounted on the Z-shaped rail.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the preheating
means are high-frequency conductors (6) arranged in the Z-rail.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the preheating
means have two electrodes contacting the sheet edges for welding.
Apparatus according to Claim 7, 
characterized in that
 the preheating
means have a radiation source. 
Apparatus according to Claim 11, 
characterized in that
 the
preheating means have means for emitting and focusing a laser beam.
