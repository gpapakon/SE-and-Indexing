 PORTABLE OFFICEBACKGROUND_QF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention This invention relates to a portable office in- corporating a portable computer, printer, phone, related power supply and implements, and more particularly to an improved carrying case arrangement to protect, organize, and store all of the component parts for easy movement from place to place and easy set up at a user selected place. Description of the Prior Art Portable computers present a self contained unit including keyboard, memory, display and CPU. Some models include a modem to transfer data and fax information to telephone lines. None of the models provide an integral printer device to provide a hard copy of compiled information for the user, such as a sales person, to present to a prospec- tive customer. Prior solutions are shown in one or more of the following U.S. Patents. 4,790,431 James W. Reel et al. December 13, 1983 4,796,735 Yutaka Horiuchi January 10, 1989 4,837,590 Glenn R. Sprague June 6, 1989 5,010,988 Lauren Brown April 30, 1991 These attempts to solve the need for a portable office do not fulfill the entire needs. The soft sided carrier fails to provide adequate protection for the electronic equipment while being transported from place to place. Sharp corners may push against the soft side and then against the equipment with a chance of damage to the electronics. Even the solutions with state of the art soft padding fail to provide the ridged surface required to dissipate the energy from the intense blow of a sharp object. Further, the closing means for soft sided carriers usually incorporate a zip- per. The zippers, strained with the weight of the equip- ment and the stress of movement from place to place, usually fail. A catastrophic failure in the zipper may 

result in dumping the electronics onto the pavement or in- advertent loss of items in the carrier. The prior art solutions incorporating a hard sided carriers protect the equipment but are configured to provide a raised platform for the computer and its keyboard. This raised position is exaggerated even more when the portable office is used on a desk. Because of the raised position the user has to reach over the edge of the carrier to access the keyboard. Because the keyboard is stationed in the rased platform above the surface of the desk, the use of the keyboard may inflict long term damage to the user in the form of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Thus there has long been a need for an arrange- ment utilize a ridged protective case in a configuration which

WHAT IS CLAIMED IS: 1. A portable office carrying case movable to a user selected work surface comprising: a base, fabricated of ridged material, forming a bottom platform of said case, having a front edge, a back edge and side edges there between; two side panels, each vertically mounted to one said side edge of said base; first catch means mounted on said side panels remote from said base; a first hard side hingedly attached by an edge to said front edge of said base and having first latch means mounted on said first hard side in a position remote from said base to removably attach said first hard side in substantially a vertical position to said first catch means; second catch means mounted on the outside sur- face of said first hard side at a position remote from said base; a lip mounted to said hinged edge of said first hard side to securely hold a user selected portable com- puter, having a keyboard and display, between said lip and said first hard side under the condition of the user moving said first hard side from engagement with said side panels to a position engaging said work surface and back into position to be engaged with said side panels; a second hard side attached by an edge to said back edge of said base and having fastening means remote from said base to attach said second hard side in substan- tially a vertical position to both said side panels; a top hingedly attached by a first edge to the ends of said side panels remote from said base; second latch means mounted on said top remote from said first edge and positioned to be removably en- gagable with said second catch means; and, a divider panel, fabricated of ridged material, mounted to said two side panels in a substantially verti- cal position between said first hard side and said second 


hard side forming compartments with said case whereby, un- der the condition of said base being placed on said work surface and said first hard side unlatched from said side panels and lowered to said work surface, the keyboard of said portable computer being made accessed to said user at substantially the level of said work surface.
2. The portable office defined in claim 1 wherein said side panels are fabricated of ridged material.
3. The portable office defined in claim 2 fur- ther comprising a hinge to attach said second hard side to said back side of said base and wherein said fastening means comprises catch means mounted on said side panels remote from said base and latch means mounted to said second hard side in a position engagable with said catch means.
4. The portable office defined in claim 1 wherein said side panels are fabricated of flexible material.
5. The portable office defined in claim 4 wherein said side panels are fabricated with a expandable fold.
6. The portable office defined in claim 1 wherein said base further comprising a second platform mounted by the ends to said side panels at a preselected distance remote from and substantially parallel to said bottom platform.
7. The portable office defined in claim 1 fur- ther comprising first walls forming apertures in said second platform whereby the user may install cables to electrically connect the user installed electronic equip- ent. 


 8. The portable office defined in claim 1 wherein said top is concave on the side facing said base and further comprises a plurality of detachable latchable straps whereby said user may mount -preselected implements into said top being secured in place by said straps.
9. The portable office defined in claim 3 wherein said mounting of said divider panel to said side panels is a swivel at a preselected distance remote from said base whereby said divider panel may be turned sub- stantially horizontal to said work surface under the con- dition of said first hard side and said second hard side unlatched from said side panels and moved into substan- tially horizontal position.
10. The portable office defined in claim 1 fur- ther comprising pockets mounted on said divider panel.
11. The portable office defined in claim 1 fur- ther comprising a handle mounted to the outside surface of said top.
12. The portable office defined in claim 4 fur- ther comprising a carrying strap attachable to said side panels.
13. The portable office defined in claim 1 fur- ther comprising: a storage pocket formed by pocket material having a U-shaped edge stitched to said second hard side, the transverse dimension of said pocket material being substantially greater than the transverse dimension of said U shaped stitching causing said storage pocket to bulge outwardly from said second hard side defining a wide opening; a lid having one edge stitched to said second hard side adjacent said opening, said lid projecting out- 


wardly from said second hard side; and, fastener means mounted on said lid and said storage pocket in a position to be engaged to close said storage pocket to secure items placed therein by the user.
14. The portable office defined in claim 4 fur- ther comprising: a storage pocket formed by pocket material having a U-shaped edge stitched to said second hard side, the transverse dimension of said pocket material being substantially greater than the transverse dimension of said U shaped stitching causing said storage pocket to bulge outwardly from said second hard side defining a wide opening; a lid having one edge stitched to said second hard side adjacent said opening, said lid projecting out- wardly from said second hard side; and, fastener means mounted on said lid and said storage pocket in a position to be engaged to close said storage pocket to secure items placed therein by the user.
