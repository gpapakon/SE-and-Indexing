<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a process for quantitative determination of the distortions of radiographic images which are generated using an image intensifier. In this process, a distorted radiographic test image of a test object (G) is prepared first, and the coordinates (sg and tg) of a number of discrete image points in the test image are measured. The image points are assigned to object points (xg, yg), which have a defined position and an absorption which is distinctly different from their surroundings, within the test object. The invention also concerns a device to carry out this process. In this way, correction even of relatively large distortions is possible, by the following steps:   a) approximate calculation of the coordinates (ug, vg) of the image points in the test image onto which these object points are mapped, taking into account the geometrical distortions, b) determination of the parameters of transformation functions (s (u, v), t (u, v)), by which the measured coordinates (sg, tg) can be calculated from the calculated coordinates (ug, vg), c) approximate calculation of the coordinates (u, v) of an image point in a distorted image from its coordinates (x, y) in an undistorted image, d) application of the transformations according to b) to the thus calculated coordinates (u, v), to determine the actual coordinates (s, t) in the distorted image,   e) repetition of steps c) and d) for all image points.
