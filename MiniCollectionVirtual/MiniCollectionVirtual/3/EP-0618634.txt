<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a coaxial switch which achieves very high reliability as a result of the use of a leaf-spring arrangement (7, 8, 9, 10). Via dielectric retaining supports (5), this leaf-spring arrangement (7, 8, 9, 10) moves connecting elements (4) with which extended inner conductors (2) of coaxial connections (1) make contact. The dielectric retaining supports (5) pass through the wall (6) of a cavity (3) without touching and without friction. This avoids wear of the retaining supports (5). Exemplary embodiments are compact and light transfer switches and T-switches for space technology.

Coaxial switch for two coaxial lines, the inner-conductor
ends of which end in a cavity whose

electrically conductive walls connect the outer
conductors of the coaxial lines to one another,


having a connecting element (4; 45) for connecting the
inner-conductor ends, which is arranged in the cavity (3)

and is provided with a dielectric retaining support (5;
46, 47) and is capable of performing movements back and

forth for opening and closing the coaxial switch (20;
40),
having a guide opening in a wall of the cavity (3) for
guiding the retaining support (5; 46, 47), characterized

by the following features:
the guide opening is made in the form of a lead-through
opening (6; 54, 55) in a wall of the cavity (3) and

serves for the contactless leading through of the
retaining support (5; 46, 47),
for guiding the retaining support (5; 46, 47) during
the movements back and forth, a guiding means (7, 8, 9,

10; 48, 49, 50) is arranged outside the cavity (3) and
the lead-through opening (6; 54, 55),
a drive (12, 13, 11, 14; 52, 53) is arranged in such a
way that it acts via the retaining support (5; 46, 47) on

the connecting element (4; 45) in one of the mutually
opposed directions back and forth,
the guide means is formed by a leaf-spring arrangement
(7, 8, 9, 10; 48, 49, 50) and has two leaf springs which

are arranged parallel to each other, are restrained at
one end (38) in each case and are able to be deflected in 

the directions back and forth at the other end (32)
respectively,
each leaf spring is divided into two segments (36, 37;
65, 66) which, when there is deflection in one of the two

directions back and forth, have transverse displacements
which have mutually opposed components.
Coaxial switch according to Claim 1,
characterized in that the leaf-spring arrangement (7, 8,

9, 10) is a straight-line leaf-spring mechanism.
Coaxial switch according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that at least one inner segment (36) and

one outer segment (37) are formed in at least one spring
diaphragm (30) of the leaf-spring arrangement (7, 8, 9,

10) by cuts (35) in the spring diaphragm (30) in such a
way that the transverse displacements of the outer

segment (37) and inner segment (36) proceed in opposite
directions.
Coaxial switch according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the transverse displacements

compensate one another.
Coaxial switch according to Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the leaf-spring arrangement (7, 8,

9, 10) is a straight-line four-leaf-spring mechanism.
Coaxial switch according to one of Claims 1 to

5, characterized in that the drive means (11, 12, 14; 53,
52) have a permanent magnet (14; 50) on a rotor (12; 53),

in that a further permanent magnet (8; 52) is connected
directly or indirectly to the retaining support (5; 46)

and in that the rotor axis is arranged in such a way that
the permanent magnet (14; 50) on the rotor (12; 53)

exerts forces to move the further permanent magnet (8;
52) back and forth during rotation of the said rotor.
Coaxial switch according to one of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that, in spring diaphragms (48, 49),

at least one leaf spring (60) is formed by at least two
curved or bent cuts (63,64), one (63) lying inside the

other (64) or taken at least into the inner region of the
other (64) and turned through about 180Â°.
Coaxial switch according to one of Claims 1 to 
7, characterized in that two leaf-spring arrangements are

assigned to different retaining supports (46, 46a) and
two leaf springs belonging to different ones of these

leaf-spring arrangements are integrally connected to each
other.
