<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus for molecular characterization,
particularly, but not exclusively, to a molecular characterization detector wherein light is
scattered by molecules of a sample, and the scattered light is detected and analyzed. The
molecular characterization detector is typically utilized with a liquid chromatography
system, but is not limited to such use.A well-known need exists within industries involved with macromolecules to characterize
molecules created by or used in various processes. Application areas where this need is of
particular interest include quality control laboratories, research laboratories and
manufacturing operations in the plastics, pharmaceutical, biotech and chemicals industries.
Typical measurements to characterize molecules include determination of the molecular
weight distributions and polydispersity when different molecular weights are included in
the sample, molecular sizes (hydrodynamic radii, radii of gyration), concentrations and
conformation information, including shape information and molecular branching
information.The most common technique for molecular characterization is liquid chromatography
(LC), which involves the preparation of the sample for the particular detection method to
be used and the detection method itself. In this well known analytical technique, a flowing
mixture of a solvent and the substances to be tested (a mixture of molecules with various
molecular weights and other molecular characteristics) is passed through specifically
selected chromatography columns which result in the component molecules being
separated in time in the flowing solvent according to their size or according to some other
molecular characteristic. The flowing fluid then passes through the detector. In one type
of detector, a laser beam is directed through the fluid, and the scattered light is analyzed to
provide molecular characterization.Examples of uses of liquid chromatography are the analyses of proteins, commercial resins,
natural and synthetic polymers, nucleic acids, plasticizers, plant and animal metabolites, 
lubricants, dyes, petroleum residues, pharmaceuticals, amino acids, pigments,
polysaccharides, pesticides, herbicides, fungicide, surfactants, lipids, explosives, and other
materials.The detectors have used various techniques for detecting light scattered by sample
molecules. In one prior art system, the sample is surrounded by an array of detectors
which collect laser light scattered by the sample at different angles. In another
