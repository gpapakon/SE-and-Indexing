<ABSTRACT>
A shrinkage device for goods (15) stacked on pallets (16) has a horizontally movable frame (34), on which individual burners (34) are movable on respective guides (32) along a frame leg (30). As a result of the simultaneous movement of all the burners (34) in the horizontal direction, a continuous strip is shrunk in each case, the burners in each case moving apart, that is to say in opposite directions, from one corner. The next strip is then covered by raising the frame.
