<DESCRIPTION>
The mesophilic filamentous fungus Trichoderma reesei is very efficient
in secreting cellulase enzymes into the growth medium. In optimized
cultivation conditions amounts, up to 40 g/l of extracellular cellulase have
been reported (Durand er al., Enzyme Microb. Technol. 10:341-346 (1988):
Durand er al., in Biochemistry and Genetics of Cellulose Degradation.
Academic Press, 1988, pp. 135-151).Development of transformation systems for T. reesei (Knowles et al.,
EP244,234; Penttilä et al., Gene 61:155-164 (1987): Berka et al., EP215.594)
has made possible the application of genetic engineering methods to the
fungus. By genetic engineering, production profiles of different cellulase
enzymes have been modulated e.g., to give strains with improved levels of the
endoglucanase I enzyme. The strong cbh1 promoter has been applied to
promote endoglucanase expression (Nevalainen et al., "The molecular biology
of Trichoderma and its application to the expression of both homologous and
heterologous genes," in Molecular lndusrrial Mycology, Leong and Berka,
eds., Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, pp. 129-148 (1991); and Harkki, A.
et al., Enzyme Microb. Technol. 13:227-233 (1991)).In addition to tailoring the production profiles of homologous proteins,
the production potential of T. reesei has been harnessed to express various
heterologous proteins in the fungus. So far examples are few and include
e.g., calf chymosin (Knowles et al., EP244.234; Berka et al., EP215,594;
Harkki, A. et al., Bio/Technol. 7:596-603 (1989); Uusitalo, J.M. er al., J.
Biotechnol. 17:35-50 (1991)), CBHI-Fab fusion antibodies raised against 2-phenyl-oxazolone
(Nyyssönen et al., WO92/01797) and a fungal ligninolytic 
enzyme (Saloheimo, M. and Niku-Paavola, M.-L. Bio/Technol. 9:987-990
(1991)). For improved expression the desired gene has been inserted into a
cbh1 expression cassette and introduced into T. reesei by protoplast
transformation (Harkki, A. et al., Bio/Technol. 7:596-603 (1989); Nyyssönen
et al., WO92/01797; Saloheimo, M. and Niku-Paavola, M.-L. Bio/Technol.
9:987-990 (1991)). Even though heterologous filamentous fungal promoters
such as Aspergillus amdS, argB and glucoamylase (GA) can function in T.
reesei at least to some extent (Penttilä et al., Gene 61:155-164 (1987);
Knowles et al., EP244,234) efficient expression requires the use of a
homologous promoter. In addition, better yields have been obtained in some
cases by producing the desired gene product as a fusion protein (Harkki, A.
et al., Bio/Technol. 7:596-603 (1989); Nyyssönen

<CLAIMS>
A method for obtaining a composition comprising a phytate degrading enzyme
and at least one Trichoderma enzyme selected from a group consisting of a β-glucan

degrading activity, CBHI, CBHII, EGI and EGII, comprising the steps of:

a) preparing a recombinant construct containing a gene encoding a
phytate degrading enzyme selected from phytase and pH 2.5 acid

phosphatase wherein said phytase has the amino acid sequence of
SEQ ID NO: 8, or wherein said pH 2.5 acid phosphatase has the amino

acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, and a signal sequence operably linked
to said gene;
b) transforming a Trichoderma reesei host with said construct;
c) cultivating the transformed Trichoderma reesei host under conditions
suitable for said Trichoderma reesei host and for expression of said

phytate degrading enzyme;
d) and removing the mycelium from the culture medium.
The method of claim 1, wherein said DNA construct is provided to said host in
a linear form.
The method of claim 1, wherein said DNA construct is provided to said host in
a circular plasmid form.
The method of claim 2, wherein said linear form lacks bacterial sequences.
