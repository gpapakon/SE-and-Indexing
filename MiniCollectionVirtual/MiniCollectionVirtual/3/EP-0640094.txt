<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are recombinant vectors encoding immunoglobulin-like domains and portions thereof, such as T-cell variable domains, antidoby Fc-hinge fragments, subfragments and mutant domains with reduced biological half lives. Methods of producing large quantities of such domains, heterodimers, and fusion proteins following expression and secretion by prokaryotic host cells are also reported. Described are single chain T-cell receptors, which are folded into beta -pleated sheet structures similar to those of immunoglobulin variable domains; antibody Fc and Fc-hinge domains, which have the same in vivo stability as intact antibodies; and domains engineered to have reduced in vivo half lives. These DNA constructs and protein domains will be useful as templates for in vitro mutagenesis and high resolution structural studies; for immunization and vaccination; and for the production of recombinant antibodies or chimaeric proteins with increased or decreased stability and longevity for therapeutic and diagnostic uses.

 DESCRIPTIONRECOMBINANT PRODUCTION OFIMMUNOGLOBULIN-LIKE DOMAINS IN PROKARYOTIC CELLSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThis is a continuation-in-part of co-pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/963,333, filed October 19, 1992; which was a continuation-in-part of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/, 873, 30, filed April 24, 1992. The entire text of each of the above-referenced disclosures is specifically incorporated by reference herein without disclaimer.-The U.S. Government owns certain rights in the present invention pursuant to NIH grant R29 AI31592-011. Field of the InventionThe present invention relates generally to the fields of immunology and molecular biology. The invention relates to vectors useful for the expression of immunoglobulin-like domains and fragments, such as T-cell variable domains and wild type and engineered antibody Fc fragments; to bacterial cells capable of secreting said domains, engineered domains, heterodimers and fusion proteins in large quantities; to recombinant domains, fusion proteins or other engineered proteins which have modified in vivo stability; and to methods for their production and use.2. Description of Related ArtMost glycoproteins that mediate antigen recognition or cell-cell recognition in the immune system contain related structural elements, suggesting that they share a 

common evolutionary history. Such genes and the resultant protein elements are thus members of an evolutionary conserved group, which has been termed the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Included in the immune system branch of the immunoglobulin superfamily are antibodies, T cell receptors, MHC glycoproteins, the CD2, CD4 and CD8 proteins, some of the polypeptide chains of the CD3 complex associated with the T cell receptor, various Fc receptors on lymphocytes and other white blood cells, and i^-microglobulin.All of the above molecules contain one or more immunoglobulin (Ig) -like domains which exhibit considerable structural homology. Each immunoglobulin- like domain typically has about 100 amino acids and_is thought to be folded into a characteristic structure with two antiparallel β sheets, usually stabilized by a conserved disulfide bond. Many of these molecules are dimers or higher oligomers in which Ig homology units of one chain interact with those in another. Other key molecules which contain immunoglobulin-like domains have also been identified, these include receptors such as the PDGF receptor, and cell adhesion molecules such as N-CAM and Ng-CAM.The majority of T cells
