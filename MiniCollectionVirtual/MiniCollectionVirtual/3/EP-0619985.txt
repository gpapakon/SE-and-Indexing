<ABSTRACT>
A hemostatic clip (10) for application to body tissue 
is disclosed which includes opposed leg portions (12, 14) 

connected by a bail portion (24) with each leg portion having a 
tissue contacting surface (32, 34) defined thereon. A pair of 

projections (36) and a pair of recessed areas (38) are defined 
on each tissue contacting surface and are disposed in an 

alternating arrangement such that the movement inhibiting 
structures on one leg portion are in juxtaposed alignment with 

those on the opposed leg portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to surgical clips, and more 
particularly to hemostatic surgical clips for application to blood 
vessels or body tissue. Surgical clips in accordance with the pre-characterising 
part of claim 1 are disclosed in 
US-A-5171250 Ligation or occlusion of veins, arteries or blood vessels 
has been a necessary part of surgical procedures for many years. 
Typically, a severed blood vessel requires closure on both sides of 
a severance site before actual cutting takes place. In the past, 
surgeons used thread or suture material to tie a blood vessel prior 
to severing the vessel. This procedure was often time consuming 
and required great dexterity on the part of the surgeon to properly 
close the vessel. In many instances, the assistance of a nurse or 
attending surgeon was necessary to perform this procedure. The advent of surgical clips and clip appliers has 
greatly enhanced the art of vessel occlusion. Surgical clips are 
now commonly used for vessel ligation and occlusion. Examples of 
surgical hemostatic clips are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 
5,171,253; 5,171,252; 5,100,420; 5,084,057; 4,971,198; 4,844,066; 
4,799,481; 4,702,247; 4,414,721; 4,188,953; 4,146,130; 3,867,944; 
and 3,363,628. Many factors are critical to the design of a surgical 
hemostatic clip. For example, it is imperative that the clip does 
not slip or become dislodged from a blood vessel after it has been 
applied. If the clip is not securely positioned, blood may begin 
flowing into the surgical site through the unclamped vessel. This  
 
serves to delay the operation while the surgeon locates and 
reclamps the vessel. Depending upon the type and location of the 
surgery, repairing the vessel may be difficult. Another consideration is that a surgical hemostatic clip 
should be designed to fully and completely close about a vein, 
artery, or blood vessel and completely stop the flow therethrough. 
A clip which does not completely occlude the flow of blood may be 
unsuitable for its intended function. Generally, surgical hemostatic clips are U-shaped or V-shaped 
in configuration and define a pair of legs joined at one end 
by an apex or crown and spaced apart at the opposed ends to define 
an opening therebetween. The inside surfaces of the clip legs may 
be constructed in a manner to improve the occluding functions of 
the clip as well as to restrict longitudinal and transverse 
dislocation of the clip after it has been applied to the target 
blood vessel. An example of a clip having such a construction is 
des

<CLAIMS>
A hemostatic clip (200, 300, 400) for application to body 
tissue comprising: 


a deformable clip body (10) defining first and second 
opposed leg portions (12, 14) and a connecting bail portion 

(24), each of said first and second leg portions having a 
tissue-contacting surface defined thereon, said tissue-contacting 

surface of said first leg portion having a 
plurality of spaced-apart protuberances (206, 306, 406) 

provided thereon, said tissue-contacting surface of said 
second leg portion having a plurality of spaced apart recessed 

areas (212, 312, 412) provided therein in juxtaposed alignment 
with said protuberances for respective reception of said 

protuberances when said clip body (10) is deformed and said 
opposed leg portions (12, 14) are brought into approximation 

by parallel closure,
 
the clip being 
characterised in that:
each recessed area (212, 312, 412) has a length (L) in 
the lengthwise direction of the leg portion in which it is 

found which exceeds by a factor of two the corresponding 
lengthwise dimension (l, D) of the major axis of each of the 

plurality of protuberances (206. 306, 406). 
A hemostatic clip as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
plurality of protuberances (206, 306, 406) are each 

substantially convex in configuration. 
A hemostatic clip as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein said 
plurality of recessed areas (212, 312, 412) are each 

substantially concave in configuration.  
 
A hemostatic clip as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
wherein said plurality of protuberances (206) each have a 

ramped leading edge portion (208). 
A hemostatic clip as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
wherein said plurality of protuberances (206) each have a 

substantially polygonal cross-sectional configuration. 
A hemostatic clip as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
wherein said plurality of recessed areas (212, 312, 412) each 

have a substantially polygonal cross-sectional configuration. 
A hemostatic clip as claimed in any of the preceding claims, 
wherein said clip (200, 300, 400) is fabricated from a 

material selected from stainless steel, tantalum, and 
titanium.
