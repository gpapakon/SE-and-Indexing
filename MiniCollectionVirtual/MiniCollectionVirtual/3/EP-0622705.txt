<ABSTRACT>
A replacement toner cartridge sealing strip having a 
smooth support layer (3), a resilient layer (7) attached 

to the support layer, and a smooth, compliant outer 
layer (9). A finger hole (5) provides a handle. The 

strip can be inserted by external force into the 
existing channel of an emptied cartridge to be refilled. 

The smooth compliant surface does not collect toner as 
the strip is removed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the refilling (sometimes 
termed remanufacture) of electrophotographic toner 
cartridges. Toner is taken from the cartridge in 
ordinary course to develop images and therefore the 
cartridge becomes empty of toner. Some cartridges are 
suitable for reuse if the toner is replaced (usually 
with some other reconditioning steps), and it is the 
refilling with toner of such cartridges to which this 
invention is directed. To prevent leaking of the toner 
during shipment of cartridges of interest with respect 
to this invention, the toner is held in a hopper chamber 
with a removable seal. At the time of use the seal is 
removed, and the toner can then drop by gravity into a 
part of the cartridge having a toner delivery system 
used for image development. This invention relates to a 
seal to be inserted before such refilling, in order to 
seal the toner hopper for shipment. If the toner hopper is separated from the adjoining 
chamber of the toner cartridge, then a seal may be 
readily applied using adhesive, heat fusion or other 
techniques not readily implemented when the two chambers 
are attached. This invention is particularly, but not 
exclusively, directed to providing a insertable seal for 
the Canon SX Toner cartridge. The original seal in that 
cartridge is a thin sheet of polyethylene folded back on 
itself in the long dimension to form a double 
lamination, with the lamination which faces the toner 
hopper being attached to the opening of the hopper. The 
seal extends out of the cartridge with a plastic tab 
attached to it to form a handle. At the time of use, 
the handle is pulled. The attachment is broken by the 
pulling force, and the seal is removed. The seal is 
flimsy and cannot be reinserted into the cartridge.  
 The toner hopper has an access opening from which a 
plug can be removed, through which the hopper can be 
refilled with toner. A seal must be applied to the 
bottom opening of the toner hopper so that the refilled 
cartridge can be transported. A seal which can be 
simply and directly inserted in the channel of the 
hopper in which the original seal was located avoids the 
costs and burdens of breaking the attachment of the 
toner hopper to the adjoining chamber. It is also 
desirable to avoid the costs and burdens of employing a 
tool which enters the cartridge through the channel to 
carry the seal to its place or to apply adhesive or heat 
or the like. This invention employs a strip having a support 
lamination and a resilient lamination. Such

<CLAIMS>
An insertable sealing strip for use with a 
toner cartridge having a channel (30) around an opening 

in a toner hopper (20) of such toner cartridge, said 
sealing strip comprising a support lamination (3) which 

is smooth on the side constituting the outside of said 
strip, a resilient foam lamination (7) attached to said 

support lamination, and a compliant lamination (9) which 
is smooth on the side away from said resilient 

lamination and is attached to said resilient lamination 
on the side opposite said support lamination, said strip 

being substantially rigid against longitudinal pushing 
force and having a handle portion at one end for pulling 

said strip from said cartridge when said cartridge is 
being prepared for use in imaging. 
A sealing strip as claimed in claim 1, in which 
said handle portion is an opening (5) in said strip. 
A sealing strip as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in 
which said foam (7) comprises a polyurethane ether foam 

of about 1.25 mm thickness. 
A sealing strip as claimed in any of claims 1 
to 3, in which said foam (7) is permanently deformed to 

a reduced thickness at one end of said strip and said 
support lamination (3) is chamfered at said one end. 
A sealing strip as claimed in claim 4, in which 
said handle portion (5) is at the end of said strip 

opposite said one end. 
A toner cartridge having a toner hopper (20) 
and a connecting chamber (22) to receive toner from said 

hopper during use for imaging, an opening in said hopper 
communicating with said chamber, a channel (30) around  

 
said opening, a sealing strip in said channel, said 

strip having a support lamination (3) facing said 
chamber, a resilient lamination (7) attached to said 

support lamination on the side facing said hopper, and a 
compliant lamination (9) attached to said resilient 

lamination and smooth on the side facing said hopper, 
said strip having a thickness such that said channel 

compresses said resilient lamination in the direction of 
the thickness of said strip to form a tight seal to hold 

toner in said hopper. 
A toner cartridge as claimed in claim 6, in 
which said handle portion is an opening (5) in said 

strip. 
A toner cartridge as claimed in claim 6 or 7, 
in which said foam (7) comprises a polyurethane ether 

foam of about 1.25 mm thickness. 
A toner cartridge as claimed in any of claims 6 
to 8, in which said foam (7) is permanently deformed to 

a reduced thickness at one end of said strip and said 
support lamination (3) is chamfered at said 
one end. 
A toner cartridge as claimed in claim 9, in 
which said handle portion (5) is at the end of said 

strip opposite said one end.
