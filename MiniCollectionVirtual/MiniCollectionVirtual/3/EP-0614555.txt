Process for segmenting a contiguous region with 
diffuse boundary in a monochrome raster image, characterized 

by the following steps: 

a) a framing rectangle (R) of the region to be segmented 
is determined, the framing rectangle (R) being 

formed from the two lines of the raster image having 
the lowest and respectively highest line index, as 

well as from the two columns of the raster image 
having the lowest an
d respectively highest column 
index, in which at least T image points exhibit an 

intensity below a second threshold (T2), where T is 
a predetermined, selectable number; 
b) at the centre of this framing rectangle (R) a window 
(F) of selectable size is selected, over the image 

points of which the image intensity is averaged; 
c) a first threshold (T1) is calculated from the average 
image intensity, the first threshold (T1) being 

calculated from the average intensity (IM) in 
accordance with the formula 


T1 = max ( 
160
255
 Imax, 1.1 Â· IM) 
 
where Imax signifies the maximum intensity; 
d) all blocks of n x n image points, where n is a 
predetermined block size, in which at least one 

image point exhibits an intensity below the first 
threshold (T1) are marked. 
Process according to Claim 1, in which the blocks 
comprise 8 x 8 image points and the window comprises 

32 x 32 image points. 
Process according to Claim 1 or 2, in which image 
points above the respective thresholds are used in place  

 
of image points below one of the respective thresholds. 
Process according to one of the preceding claims, 
in which T = 2 and 


T2 = 
137
255
 Imax, 
 
and Imax signifies the maximum possible intensity.
