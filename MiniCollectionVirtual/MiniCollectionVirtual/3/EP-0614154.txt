<ABSTRACT>
The multi-tone image data is converted to a plural 
sets of binary image data with a plurality of density 

levels as threshold values. Contraction and expansion are 
sequentially executed on the plural sets of binary image 

data to correct a contour of each binary image. The plural 
sets of the processed binary image data are re-converted to 

multi-tone image data which represents a multi-tone image 
having a corrected contour.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for correcting a multi-tone image. In a prepress process, an original Image such as a 
color photograph is scanned by a color scanner to produce 
image data. However, the image captured by a scanner 
often includes defects due to rubbing-off blemishes and 
dust on the original, electric noise, and stains in an 
optical system. In a conventional pre-press system, an 
operator checks a multi-tone image displayed on a CRT, and 
if a detect is found, pixel density data in a normal image 
area is copied to the defective area to eliminate the 
defect. There are some other kinds of image correction 
process other than the elimination of defects, such as 
retouching. Recently, a colored image shown on a display 
can be electronically retouched with a light pen. In such 
electronic retouching, a multi-tone image may be corrected 
by copying image data of a normal image area to a target 
image area requiring correction. The correction process is highly time-consuming  
 
because it requires an operator to specify a position of 
each pixel to be corrected and a position of an image area 
to be copied at the position of the pixel, An object of the present invention is to provide a 
novel method and an apparatus for readily correcting a 
multi-tone image. The present invention is directed to an apparatus for 
correcting a multi-tone image. The apparatus comprises: a 
first memory for storing first multi-tone image data 
representing image density for every pixel in the multi-tone 
image; binarization means for comparing the first 
multi-tone image data with each of a plurality of threshold 
values to thereby produce a plurality of first binary image 
data representing a plurality of binary images; a second 
memory for storing the plurality of first binary image 
data; contour correction means for correcting a contour of 
each of the plurality of binary images by executing 
contraction and expansion on each of the plurality of first 
binary image data, to thereby produce a plurality of second 
binary image data; and restoration means for re-converting 
the plurality of second binary image data to second multi-tone 
age data representing a corrected multi-tone image. A plurality of first binary image data generated by 
the binarization means represent contours of a plurality of 
density levels in an original multi-tone image, and 
contraction and expansion on the plurality of first binary  
 
image data reduces unevenness or irregularities of the 
contours. The
