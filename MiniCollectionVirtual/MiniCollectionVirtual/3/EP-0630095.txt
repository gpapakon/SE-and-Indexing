<ABSTRACT>
A spider 50 for protecting rotor windings from the end of a rotor stack, comprises two 
parts, namely a hub 51 and a body portion 55. The body portion has a plurality of 

radially extending spokes 56 which cover arms 22 of laminations 21 of the rotor, at 
least in the region of the rotor windings. The body portion is fitted to and supported 

by the hub. A circumferentially extending ridge 53 is formed on the hub to provide a 
stop against which the body portion abuts to correctly locate the body portion on the 

hub. The ridge also increases the electrical creepage distance for the rotor windings 
where they lay on the hub.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a wound rotor for
an electric motor. More particularly, the invention relates
to a spider or armature end protector for a wound rotor
having a laminated stack and to wound rotors and electric
motor incorporating such spiders.Wound rotors having laminated stacks are well
known. The stacks are formed from a number of steel
laminations each having a plurality of "T"-shaped arms
extending radially from a central hub. The hub has a
central hole for mounting the laminations on to a shaft.
The distal end of the arms have circumferentially extending
projections to form the familiar "T"-shape with
the projections facing adjacent projections across a
small gap. The area defined by adjacent arms is known
as a winding tunnel and when the rotor is being wound,
the wire of the windings (also known as magnet wire) is
passed through the small gaps to lay in the winding tunnels.For many motors, such as A.C. motors operating at
line or mains voltage, the winding tunnels are lined with
insulation, called slot insulation, to isolate the windings
from the rotor stack. At the end of the stack, it is known
to provide an armature end protector, also known as a
spider because of its appearance, to maintain the separation
between the magnet wire and the rotor stack. It
is common for the slot insulation to be sheet of insulation
material such as MYLAR paper which lay in and line the
walls of the tunnels. These sheets do not wrap around
the ends of the winding tunnels and thus the spiders are
needed to guarantee the creepage distance or separation
between the rotor stack and the windings.It is known to make these spiders from fibre material,
thermosetting plastics material and from thermosoftening
plastics material. It is usual to provide spacers
between the spiders and the commutator and fan. The
spacers not only regulate the distance between the rotor
stack and the commutator and fan but also provide an
insulated sleeve over the shaft where the wire would
otherwise lay on the shaft. The spacers thus need to be
of insulating material which can withstand the heat generated
by the windings and be sufficiently thick to maintain
the required separation.Gaps between the spacers and spiders may occur
during faulty assembly or during use which may lead to
insulation failure. One piece spider and spacer combinations
overcome this problem and thus are preferred.
However, spacers made from fibre material are too expensive
for normal applications.Single piece combined spiders and spacers made
from plastics
