<ABSTRACT>
Methods for the recombinant production of saporin-containing proteins, including cell surface binding protein-saporin fusion proteins, are provided. The resulting fusion proteins are cytotoxic to targeted cells. In preferred embodiments, methods are provided for the production of basic fibroblast factor (bFGF)-saporin fusion proteins by culturing Escherichia coli that has been transformed with a vector containing DNA encoding bFGF linked via a spacer peptide to the amino terminus of a cytotoxic portion of a saporin polypeptide to obtain expression of the DNA, and isolating the resulting FGF-saporin fusion protein. FGF-saporing fusion proteins and saporin proteins containing from about 5 to 12 amino acid N-terminal extensions are also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
RECOMBINANT PRODUCTION OF SAPORIN-CONTAINING PROTEINSThis application is a continuation-in-part of United States Application Serial No. 07/901 ,718, filed June 16, 1992, by Douglas A Lappi, Isabel Barthelemy, and Andrew J. Baird entitled "RECOMBINANT PRODUCTION OF SAPORIN-CONTAINING PROTEINS". The disclosure of United States Application Serial No. 07/901 ,718 is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates to the recombinant production of proteins and more particularly to the recombinant production of saporin and saporin-containing fusion proteins. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONRibosome-inactivating-proteins (RIPs) are plant proteins that catalyticaliy inactivate eukaryotic ribosomes. RIPS have been shown to inactivate ribosomes by interfering with the protein elongation step of protein synthesis. For example, the RIP saporin (SAP) has been shown to inactivate 60S ribosomes by cleavage of the n-glycosidic bond of the adenine at position 4324 in the rat 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). This particular region in which A4324 is located in the rRNA is highly conserved among prokaryotes and eukaryotes. A4324 in 28S rRNA corresponds to A2ββ0 in Escherichia coli (E. coli) 23S rRNA. Several RIP's also appear to interfere with protein synthesis in prokaryotes, such as E fioK. Since RIPs are toxic to eukaryotic cells and some RIPs are toxic to prokaryotes (see, e.g.. Habuka et aL (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265.10988-10992). they are difficult to express using recombinant DNA methodologies.Several structurally related RIP's have been isolated from seeds and leaves of the plant Saponaria officinalis (soapwort) . Among these, saporin-6 is the most active and abundant, representing 7% of total seed proteins. Saporin is very stable, has a high isoelectric point, does not contain carbohydrates, and is resistant to denaturing agents, such as SDS, and a 

variety of proteases. The amino acid sequences of several saporin-6 isoforms from seeds are known and there appear to be families of saporin RIPs differing in few amino acid residues.Because saporin is a type I RIP, it does not possess a cell-binding chain, like the toxins ricin and abrin. Consequently, its toxicity to whole cells is much lower than the toxins. When targeted to cells so that it is internalized by the cells, however, its cytotoxicity is 100- to 1000-fold more potent than ricin A chain. Because of its cytotoxicity, saporin has been covalently linked to cell surface binding ligands to produce cytotoxic
