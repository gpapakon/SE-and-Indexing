<ABSTRACT>
A medical device, for example, an IV cannula or a syringe which has a hollow needle 4 
with a sharp distal end 6 for piercing the skin of a patient includes means for protecting 

the sharp end 6 of the needle 4 after use to minimise the possibility of accidental needle 
stick. The means includes a rod 1 2 mounted for movement through the needle 4 between 

a needle end protection position and a retracted position within the hollow needle 4; and 
means for maintaining the rod towards the needle end protection position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to medical devices and in particular to syringes which include a
hollow needle having a sharp distal end for piercing the skin of a patient.The existence of infectious diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis has highlighted the danger to
which medical personnel may be exposed when treating patients by means of catheter devices
and syringes where a sharp needle point is used to pierce the skin of the patient. Medical
personnel have been infected by physical contact with or an accidental prick by an infected
needle (needle stick).In order to protect medical personnel against inadvertent needle stick a number of solutions
have been developed whereby protective means incorporated within a catheter or syringe
prevents physical contact with the needle after use and hence against inadvertent needle stick,Many of the developments are complicated and involve the retraction of the needle within a
housing once the needle has been used. Those complications add to the expense as well as the
manufacturing difficulties involved in providing adequate anti-needle stick protection.USA patent number 4,820,267 describes a cartridge injector or pellet medicaments. The
device includes a cannula supported at a proximal end thereof by a hub which slides within a
tubular barrel, the barrel supporting an obturator which selectively penetrates the cannula to
maintain an implanted pellet in position as the cannula is withdrawn. For single pellet
dosages, the pellet is carried in the fore part of the cannula, while the case of multiple pellet
dosages, the additional pellets, prior to loading, are carried in open-ended cylindrical tubes
engageable with a proximal end of the hub whereby the obturator may be employed to transfer
the pellet to the cannula from the sleeve which is discarded. Repositioning of the hub within
the sleeve is then accomplished without disengagement of the distal end of the cannula from
the tissues of the patient and additional implantations may then be performed. EP-A 546,769 relates to a pneumoneedle through which the abdomen can be inflated with fluid
such as insufflating gas. The pneumoneedle comprises a housing having inner surfaces
defining an elongate cavity having a fluid passageway portion. The pneumoneedle includes a
cannula having a sharpened distal end for piercing tissue. A protector is present which has a
closed blunt distal end. The protector is movable relative to the cannula between a protecting
position with the blunt distal end of the protector extending beyond the
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A syringe (31) comprising a housing (34) with a hollow needle (4') extending from the
distal end of the housing (34) having a sharpened distal end (6') for piercing the skin of

a patient, the syringe (31) including means for protecting said sharpened distal end (6')
after use to minimise the possibility of inadvertent needle stick, said means comprising

a rod (12') mounted for reciprocal movement through the hollow needle (4') between a
first needle end protection position at which an end (11) of the rod (12') is level with or

extends beyond the sharpened distal end (6') of the needle (4') and a second retracted
position in which said end (11) is positioned within the hollow needle (4') and spaced

from said sharpened distal end (6') and in which second retracted position said rod (12')
extends outwardly from the proximal end of said housing (34), and means effective when the rod is in the first position for

maintaining the rod (12') towards the first needle end protection position thereby
preventing movement A the rod (12') from the first needle end

protection position towards the second retracted position.
A syringe (31) as claimed in claim 1, in which the rod (12') is solid.
A syringe (31) as claimed in claim 1 or 2, with a button (48) on the proximal end of
said rod (12').
A syringe (31) as claimed in any preceding claim, with said rod (12') in said second
retracted position.
A syringe (31) as claimed in claim 4, with a detachable spacer (46) engaging around
the rod (12') to prevent accidental movement of the rod (12') away from said second

retracted position.
A syringe as claimed in claim 4 or 5, wherein the housing comprises distal and
proximal parts (36, 38) integrally joined with aligned passages (40, 42) for passage of

the rod (12'). 
A syringe (31) as claimed in claim 6, with a substance to be administered in the passage
(40) of the distal part (36).
A syringe (31) as claimed in claim 6 or 7, where the proximal part (38) has a collar (44) at its
proximal end made of resilient material.
A syringe (31) as claimed in claim 8, in which the maintaining means includes a
shoulder (50) formed in the rod (12') which engages behind the resilient collar (44)

thereby preventing movement of the rod (12') from the second towards the first
position.
A syringe (31) as claimed in claim 7, in which the rod (12') is undercut to form the
shoulder (50) which engages behind the resilient collar (44) located at the proximal end

of the housing (34).
