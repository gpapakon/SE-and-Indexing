<ABSTRACT>
The static mixing device for a flowing medium includes a tubular shell (4) and at least one mixing element (3) arranged in the shell, the structural elements of which mixing element are essentially bridges (11, 12, 21, 22). The shell defines a main flow direction (5) of the medium and the bridges (12, 22) which carry out the mixing action are each at an angle to the main flow direction. To simplify manufacture, the mixing element is composed according to the invention from at least two strip-like, essentially zigzag-shaped or wave-shaped parts (1, 2). Preferably, the mixing element is essentially constructed to be rotationally symmetric with respect to a 180 DEG rotation about the main direction of flow.

A static mixing device for a flowing medium, comprising
a tubular housing (4) and at least one mixing element (3)

disposed in the housing, the structural elements of which
are substantially plane bars (11, 12, 21, 22), wherein

the housing defines a main direction of flow (5) of the
medium and the bars (12, 22), which exert the mixing

action, enclose an angle with the main direction of flow,
the mixing element is formed of at least two strip-like,

substantially zigzag or wavy sections (1, 2) and the
arrangement of the one section can be transported into

the arrangement of the other section by a 180° rotation
around the housing axis,
characterized in that
 the sections are disposed one above
the another and comprise bar-like regions which lie

transversally to the bars (11, 21) having a mixing action
and which are connected, face to face, to one another at

the contact points of the two sections.
A mixing device according to Claim 1,
characterized in that
 the sections (12) comprise openings
(13, 23) which each form at least one space between two

adjacent, parallel bars (12, 22).
A mixing device according to Claim 2,
characterised in that
 the openings (13, 23) are produced
by the removal of material.
A mixing device according to Claim 2,
characterized in that
 the openings (13, 23) are formed by
partial blanking or bending out of material, the bent-out

material itself having the function of bars (15a,
15b) having a mixing action. 
A mixing device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that
 the section (1) is provided in the
form of a rigid chain, the chain links each being formed

by a bar (12) having a mixing action or by groups
comprising two or more parallel bars (12) having a mixing

action.
A mixing device according to one of Claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that
 the sections (12) are produced by
stamping from metal or plastic plates or by injection

moulding.
A mixing device according to one of Claims 1 to 6,
characterized in that
 the two sections (12) of the mixing
element (3) are connected to one another by welding,

especially spot welding.
A mixing device according to one of Claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that
 at least two mixing elements (3)
are disposed one behind the other in the housing, the

adjacent mixing elements being mutually swivelled by an
angle of preferably 90° in relation to the main direction

of flow.
