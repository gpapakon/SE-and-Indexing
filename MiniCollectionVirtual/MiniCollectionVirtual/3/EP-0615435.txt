<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to skin care compositions containing retinoids for 
topical application to the skin, in particular to retinoid compositions for 
the treatment or prophylaxis of acne and for the treatment of skin that is 
damaged or susceptible to damage by photoaging or exposure to the sun. Skin care compositions containing retinoid compounds are known for the 
treatment of acne. The use of topical retinoic acid in the treatment of 
acne was first described by Kligman A. M. (see US Patent 3,729,568 and 
Arch. Derm., 99, 469-79, 1969). More recently, compositions containing retinoid compounds have been 
described as having a beneficial effect in treating and retarding damage 
to the skin caused by photoaging and exposure to the sun (UV damage). 
For example, US Patent 4,603,146 discloses a method for treating sun-damaged 
human skin topically with retinoic acid. Early studies with retinoic acid on human skin used doses of retinoic acid 
up to 1.0% w/w (see Fulton etal., Arch. Derm. 98, 396-399, 1968). At this 
dosage level, treatment resulted in initial burning, stinging and 
reddening, scaling and peeling of the skin. More recent studies have used much lower doses of topical retinoic acid in 
the range 0.025 to 0.05% w/w. Although these lower dose formulations 
result in reduced irritation compared with previously used higher doses, 
significant skin irritation still occurs. Compositions comprising retinoid compounds formulated in vehicle 
systems designed to minimise the irritant properties of the retinoid and 
also maximise the stability of the retinoid in the formulation have been 
described. GB 1 476 717 (Johnson & Johnson) discloses gel formulations for topical 
application for the treatment of acne comprising at least 0.001% by weight 
of tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid) and a vehicle system consisting 
essentially of an organic solvent which is ethanol, isopropanol, propylene 
glycol or a mixture thereof, an effective amount of a pharmaceutically  
 
acceptable antioxidant soluble in the organic solvent and an effective 
amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable gelling agent solvated in the 
organic solvent. Examples include a composition comprising tretinoin 
(0.002% w/w) and hydrocortisone (0.25% w/w) in an ethanol/isopropanol 
vehicle system. EP-A-0 266 992 (Ortho) describes compositions containing a mixture of a 
corticosteroid and a retinoid in a topically administerable, 
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier for use in treating dermatologic 
disease. A dose range from about 0.00001%
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A composition for topical application to the skin comprising a 
retinoid compound and a vehicle system for the retinoid compound 

characterised in that the concentration of the retinoid compound is in the 
range 0.0001 to 0.004% by weight of the composition and the vehicle system 

is formulated to deliver a supersaturated solution of the retinoid compound to 
the skin surface; subject to the proviso that when the composition is a two-phase 

composition calculated to generate a 6-fold supersaturated 0.0025% by 
weight solution of retinoic acid or a 10-fold supersaturated 0.002% by weight 

solution of retinyl propionate on mixing of the two phases, then one phase of 
the composition is not a solution of the retinoid compound in polyethylene 

glycol, and when the composition is a two-phase composition calculated to 
generate a 7-fold supersaturated 0.0025% by weight solution of retinoic acid, 

then one phase of the composition is not a solution of the retinoid compound 
in propylene glycol when the second phase is a mixture of glycerol, water and 

ethanol. 
A composition as claimed in claim 1 in which the retinoid compound 
is all-trans retinoic acid or 13-cis retinoic acid or an ester or amide derivative 

thereof; etretinate; retinal; retinol; or a retinol ester. 
A composition as claimed in claim 2 in which the retinoid compound 
is all-trans retinoic acid. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 in which the 
concentration of the retinoid compound is in the range 0.0005 to 0.0025% by 

weight of the total composition. 
A composition as claimed in any preceding claim which is a single-phase 
composition and wherein the vehicle system comprises a mixture of a 

volatile and a non-volatile solvent. 
A composition as claimed in claim 5 in which the non-volatile 
solvent comprises propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, propylene 

carbonate, glycerol or mixtures thereof and the volatile solvent comprises 
ethanol or a mixture of ethanol and water.  

 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4 which is a two-phase 
composition wherein the two phases are intended to be mixed together 

on or immediately prior to application to the skin, comprising a first liquid 
phase containing a retinoid compound dissolved therein and comprising a 

topically acceptable solubiliser; and a second liquid phase, physically and/or 
chemically different from the first phase but miscible therewith on admixture, 

optionally containing the same retinoid compound dissolved therein and 
comprising a topically acceptable carrier; the composition of the first and 

second liquid phases being such that each has a different lipophilicity and 
each confers a different saturated solubility on the retinoid compound; the 

concentration of retinoid compound in each phase in which it is present and 
the composition of each of the first and second liquid phases being such that, 

on admixture of the phases the retinoid compound concentration in the 
mixture thus formed is greater than the saturated retinoid compound 

concentration in the same mixture, whereby the said mixture is supersaturated 
with the retinoid. 
A composition as claimed in claim 7 wherein the topically acceptable 
carrier of the second liquid phase comprises a first component which is water 

and a second component which has a lipophilicity intermediate between that 
of water and the solubiliser of the first liquid phase. 
A composition as claimed in claim 7 or 8 in which the topically 
acceptable solubiliser is selected from propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene diol, 

polyethylene glycol, ethanol, propanol, acetone, dimethylisosorbide, 
dimethylsulphoxide, benzyl alcohol and other glycol, ether and ester solvents 

of similar polarity. 
A composition as claimed in claim 8 or 9 in which the second 
component of the topically acceptable carrier of the second liquid phase 

comprises up to 50% by weight of the topically acceptable carrier.  
 
A composition as claimed in claim 10 in which the second 
component of the topically acceptable carrier is glycerol or propylene glycol. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 11 in which the 
topically acceptable solubiliser of the first liquid phase comprises a first 

component which is non-volatile and up to 50% by weight of a relatively 
more volatile second component which has comparable volatility to water. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 8 to 12 in which the 
second liquid phase comprises up to 20% by weight of a relatively more 

volatile second component as defined in claim 12. 
A composition as claimed in claim 12 or 13 in which the relatively 
more volatile second component is ethanol, isopropanol or acetone. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 7 to 14 in which the 
relative proportion by weight of the first liquid phase to the second liquid 

phase is from 1 : 1 to 1 : 12. 
A composition as claimed in any one of claims 7 to 15 in which the 
degree of saturation on admixture of the first and second liquid phases is in 

the range 2 to 10. 
A composition as claimed in any preceding claim for use in therapy. 
The use of a composition as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 16 for 
the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of acne or
