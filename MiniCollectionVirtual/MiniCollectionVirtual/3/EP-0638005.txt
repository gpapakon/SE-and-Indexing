<ABSTRACT>
A process and device are disclosed for manufacturing a grid, in particular a pressed grid. The grid consists of a plurality of carrying bars (9) and of filling bars (5) that can be inserted into the carrying bars. Both the carrying bars (9) and the filling bars (5) are supplied by conveyors to a pressing station (3) having a holding device for the carrying bars and an actuating device for receiving and pressing the filling bars to be inserted. After the bars are pressed, the holding device is moved forward over a freely selectable distance and the actuating device is moved so that another filling bar is moved from a supply position to the working position. After all bars which form the grid are pressed, the grid is subjected to a finishing process.
