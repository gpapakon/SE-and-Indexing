<ABSTRACT>
A method for inhibiting or preventing corrosion of 
metals in contact with an aqueous system containing 

dissolved oxygen comprising adding to the system an 
oxygen scavenger having the formula 


wherein n is 5 or 6, lactone derivatives thereof, or its 
water soluble salts, in an amount effective to 

substantially remove the dissolved oxygen.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the addition of oxygen 
scavengers to aqueous systems to reduce the corrosion of 
metals that are in contact with the aqueous system, and 
more particularly to the use of certain oxygen scavenging 
compositions which comprise hydroxycarboxylic acids and 
related compounds. The corrosion of metal surfaces which are in contact 
with aqueous systems is a common problem. Corrosion may 
occur in various locations including boiler feedwater 
lines, heaters, steam lines, process tanks and return 
lines. Dissolved oxygen in the aqueous system is often a 
principal factor influencing the formation of the 
corrosion, particularly where iron and steel are the 
materials of construction. The corrosion of iron based 
metals in conventional boiler systems is a well known 
problem, and controlling the presence of oxygen in boiler 
systems, particularly in the feedwater section has 
received considerable attention. Oxygen removal may be 
partially accomplished by either vacuum or thermal 
deaeration, or both. Complete removal of oxygen cannot 
be effected by these means, however, and further removal 
by use of a chemical oxygen scavenging agent, such as 
sodium sulfite, has been a customary practice. Recently, the use of low pressure boilers (i.e. 
those operating below about 150 psig) has been 
increasingly supplanted by the use of boilers operating 
at moderate pressure (i.e. operating between about 150 
psig and about 600 psig) and high pressure (i.e. 
operating above about 600 psig). As boiler operating 
temperatures and pressures have increased, there has been 
particular interest in the performance of chemical oxygen  
 
scavengers which are effective at these operating 
conditions. The use of sulfites at elevated temperatures 
and pressures has been known to result in the formation 
of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide, which can be a 
source of corrosion. Other scavenging agents such as 
hydrazine, hydroquinone, and certain hydroxylamines have 
been found to perform satisfactorily in some 
circumstances. For example, U.S. Patent No. 4,278,635 to 
Kerst discloses the use of various dihydroxy, diamino, 
and amino hydroxy benzenes and their lower alkyl 
substituted derivatives, and particularly hydroquinone, 
as corrosion control agents in boiler systems. U.S. 
Patent No. 4,282,111 to Cuiba also relates to the use of 
hydroquinone to reduce the oxygen content of an aqueous 
medium. U.S. Patent No. 4,363,734 to Solvinsky discloses 
the use of hydroquinone as a catalyst in combination
