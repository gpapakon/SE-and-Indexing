<ABSTRACT>
To accommodate placement of both input and output media 
trays (54, 56) on the same side of the printer 

housing (52) of an ink-jet printer (50) for operator 
convenience, a paper path with a direction reversal is 

employed. A paper preconditioning preheater 
(72) with a curved surface and a multi-purpose paper path 

component (70) accomplish the direction reversal. The 
printer further includes a manual feed path for guiding a 

manually fed sheet or envelope from a manual feed inlet 
slot (80) at the top, rear corner of the printer to a path 

converging location (95) with the primary feed path. The 
preheater (72) includes a heating portion (128) disposed 

along the primary path between the path converging location 
and the print area (104), to provide the capability of 

preheating media fed either from the input tray (54) or the 
manual feed slot (80).

<DESCRIPTION>
This application is related to the European patent 
applications 0622222A entitled IMPROVED MEDIA CONTROL 
AT INK-JET PRINT ZONE, and 0622223A entitled MULTI-PURPOSE 
PAPER PATH COMPONENT FOR INK-JET PRINTER. The present invention relates to the field of ink-jet 
printers. With the advent of computers came the need for devices 
which could produce the results of computer generated 
work  
 
product in a printed form. Early devices used for this 
purpose were simple modifications of the then current 
electric typewriter technology. But these devices could 
not produce graphics or multicolored images, nor could they 
print as rapidly as was desired. Numerous advances have been made in the field. The 
impact dot matrix printer is still widely used, but is not 
as fast or as durable as required in many applications, and 
cannot easily produce high definition color printouts. The 
development of the thermal ink-jet printer has solved many 
of these problems. Commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 
4,728,963, issued to S.O. Rasmussen et al., describes an 
example of this type of printer technology. Thermal ink-jet printers employ a plurality of resistor 
elements to expel droplets of ink through an associated 
plurality of nozzles. In particular, each resistor element, 
which is typically a pad of resistive material about 
50µm by 50µm in size, is located in a chamber filled with 
ink supplied from an ink reservoir comprising an ink-jet 
cartridge. A nozzle plate, comprising a plurality of 
nozzles, or openings, with each nozzle associated with a 
resistor element, defines a part of the chamber. Upon the 
energizing of a particular resistor element, a droplet of 
ink is expelled by droplet vaporization through the nozzle 
toward the print medium, whether paper, fabric, or the 
like. The firing of ink droplets is typically under the 
control of a microprocessor, the signals of which are 
conveyed by electrical traces to the resistor elements. The ink cartridge containing the nozzles is moved 
repeatedly across the width of the medium to be printed 
upon. At each of a designated number of increments of this 
movement across the medium, each of the nozzles is caused 
either to eject ink or to refrain from ejecting ink according 
to the program output of the controlling microprocessor. 
Each completed movement across the medium can print  
 
a swath approximately as wide as the number of nozzles 
arranged in a column on the ink cartridge multiplied times 
the distance between nozzle centers. After each such 
completed

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet printer (50) comprising a printhead 
disposed at a print area (104) for ejecting droplets of 

ink onto a surface of a print medium (90) in a controlled 
fashion during printing operations;
 
   an input supply of print media disposed at an 

input end of a primary media path, said path guiding 
said medium (90) from said input supply, and past said 

print area (104);
 
   first means (290) for advancing a sheet of 

medium from said input supply into said input end of 
said primary media path;
 
   second means (100A, 100B, 102) for advancing 

said medium from a location on said primary path upstream 
from said print area through said primary feed 

path to position said medium in relation to said printhead; 
and
 
   an alternative feed path for guiding a print 

medium from an alternative feed slot (80) which is 
separated from said input end of said primary media 

path to a converging location (95) with said primary 
feed path and into engagement with said second advancing 

means (100A, 100B, 102); characterised in that the 
printer further comprises media preheating means (72) 

for preheating said medium (90) prior to advancement of 
said medium to said print area (104) to condition said 

medium for printing operations, and in that said preheating 
means (72) includes a heating element (128)
