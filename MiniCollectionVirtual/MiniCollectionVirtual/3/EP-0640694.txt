<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an aluminum alloy 
substrate for a lithographic printing plate having a good 
electrolytic graining property and to a process of producing 
same. Conventional aluminum alloy substrates for a support for a 
lithographic printing plate are generally provided in the form 
of a 0.1 to 0.5 mm thick cold-rolled sheet made of an aluminum 
alloy such as JIS A1050, A1100, A3003, or the like. Such 
aluminum alloy cold-rolled sheets are generally produced by 
machining the surface of a semicontinuous-cast (DC) slab or 
billet, homogenization heat-treating the billet when necessary, 
heating the billet to a selected temperature, hot-rolling the 
heated billet to a hot-rolled strip, cold-rolling the hot-rolled 
strip with an intermediate annealing between the cold 
rolling passes, and final cold rolling the strip to a cold-rolled 
sheet. Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) Nos. 3-79798 
and 5-156414 disclosed a process of producing an aluminum alloy 
support for a lithographic printing plate, in which an aluminum 
alloy melt is continuously cast and rolled to form a strip, 
which is not homogenized but is subjected to cold rolling, heat 
treatment, and straightening. The aforementioned conventional process using a DC slab or 
billet has drawbacks in that the process steps are complicated 
and take much time, the production cost is high, the casting 
speed is slow, the rolling and heat treatment conditions are 
strict, and heat treatments must be carried out many times, and 
the process cannot provide an aluminum alloy support with  
 
stable properties, particularly a good electrolytic graining 
property. The process disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent 
Publication (Kokai) Nos. 3-79798 and 5-156414 also has 
drawbacks in that, although a continuous casting and rolling 
process is used, the support does not provide a sufficiently 
uniform surface when electrolytically grained and fails to have 
a satisfactory press life and that heat treatments are not 
conducted under suitable conditions. An object of the present invention is to provide a 
continuously cast and rolled aluminum alloy substrate for a 
lithographic printing plate having a uniform surface, when 
electrolytically grained, and a good press life. To achieve the object according to the first aspect of the 
present invention, there is provided a continuously cast and 
rolled aluminum alloy substrate for an electrolytically 
grainable lithographic printing plate, consisting of 0.20 to 
0.80 wt% of Fe and the
