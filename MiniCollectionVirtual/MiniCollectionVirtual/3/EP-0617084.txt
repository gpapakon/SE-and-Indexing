<DESCRIPTION>
This specification is divided out from parent
application EP-A-0,404,411.This invention relates to fluoroelastomer
compositions comprising elastomeric copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene,
vinylidene fluoride, and one or more
hydrocarbon olefins and curing agents, said composition
comprising a specified sulfonyl compound.Silane compounds have been used to improve
adhesion between polymer substrates and inorganic
materials or substrates, such as metals, fiberglass and
glass (see for example, "A Guide to Dow Corning Silane
Coupling Agents", Form No. 23-012B-85, published by Dow
Corning Corporation, Midland, Michigan). In some
applications, compositions comprising silane compounds
are hydrolyzed to their silanol form which may then react
with the inorganic material, e.g., by reacting with
hydroxyl moieties present on the inorganic material
surface. Generally, the silane compound also has an
organofunctional group which reacts with the polymeric
material thus enhancing the bonding between the inorganic
material and the polymer. Compositions comprising silane
compounds have been successfully used as adhesion
promoters with some fluoroelastomers, see for example,
"Dynamar™ Bond Metal Bonding Agent - 5150", Brochure No.
Y-IFE5150-2 (73.05)RI, published by the 3M Company, 1983.
However, applicant has discovered that copolymers
comprising tetrafluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride, and
one or more hydrocarbon olefins, cannot be bonded to 
inorganic substrates using only silane compounds to
achieve good bonding or adhesion between inorganic
substrates and the fluoroelastomers.Applicants' invention improves the bonding or
adhesion between curable fluoroelastomers comprising
interpolymerized repeating units derived from vinylidene
fluoride, tetrafluoroethylene, and hydrocarbon olefin
(e.g., propylene) and inorganic substrates, such the
metal cores, supports or inserts used in various molded
seals such as shaft seals, valve stem seals, and gaskets.In one aspect, this invention provides a curable
elastomeric composition characterized in that it comprises the
following components:
(A) fluoroelastomer gum comprising
interpolymerized, repeating units derived from vinylidene
fluoride, tetra-fluoroethylene and copolymerizable
hydrocarbon olefin;(B) polyhydroxy compound; (C) organo-onium compound; and (D) RfSO2CHR7SO2Rf, where R7 is selected from H, Br,
Cl, I, alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms,
alkenyl radicals having 3 to 4 carbon atoms, aryl
radicals having up to 10 carbon atoms and alkaryl
radicals having up to 10
