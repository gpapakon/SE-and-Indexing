<ABSTRACT>
An antitumor agent is provided by including, as an active 
ingredient, a polysaccharide-glycan complex obtained by treating 

a Gram-positive bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria and 

Bifidobacterium
 strains with a cell wall lytic enzyme produced 
by a bacterium belonging to the genus 
Achromobacter
. 
The polysaccharide-glycan complex has no toxicity and 
causes no side effect. Being water-soluble, it is easily 

formulated into any arbitrary dose form, such as an injectable 
solution. It can easily be prepared from an easily available 

starting material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antitumor agent. Conventional antitumor agents are divided into 
chemotherapeutic agents which directly act on a tumor and 
immunopotentiators which potentiate immunity to bring about an 
antitumor effect. Known immunopotentiators include muramyl dipeptide or a 
polysaccharide constituting microbial cells of tubercle 
bacillus, hemolytic streptococcus, etc., and the cell wall of 
these bacteria. However, none of them have achieved sufficient 
immunopotentiating activity when used alone. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
antitumor agent which has excellent antitumor activity based on 
immunopotentiation with reduced side effects and which can be 
prepared starting with a highly safe bacterium used in food 
production. The present inventors have conducted extensive 
investigations into the antitumor activities of components 
constituting the cell walls of a number of bacteria. As a 
result, they have succeeded in providing an antitumor agent 
comprising, as an active ingredient, a polysaccharide-glycan 
complex obtained by treating a Gram-positive bacterium with a 
cell wall lytic enzyme produced by a bacterium belonging to the 
genus Achromobacter. The polysaccharide-glycan complex, the active ingredient  
 
of the antitumor agent of the present invention, has no toxicity 
and causes no side effects. Being water-soluble, it is easily 
formulated into any arbitrary dose form, such as an injectable 
solution. Further, it can easily be prepared from a readily 
available starting material, i.e., microbial cells of lactic 
acid bacteria or Bifidobacterium strains generally used in food 
production. Taking advantage of these characteristics, the 
antitumor agent according to the present invention can be 
administered through various routes to exhibit high curing 
effects on tumor cells. Fig. 1 shows a crossliked network structure of a cell 
wall. Fig. 2 shows a polysaccharide-glycan complex obtained by 
hydrolysis of the crosslinking by cell wall lytic enzyme. The invention will be further explained below. The cell wall lytic enzyme produced by a bacterium 
belonging to the genus Achromobacter includes "Achromopeptidase 
(TBL-1)" sold by Wako Pure Chemical Co., Ltd. The 
Achromopeptidase (TBL-1) is derived from Achromobacterlyticus 
M497-1. The cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria, such as lactic 
acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium strains, are composed of a 
network structure in which basic sugar chains of N-acetylglucosamine 
and N-acetylmuramic acid are
