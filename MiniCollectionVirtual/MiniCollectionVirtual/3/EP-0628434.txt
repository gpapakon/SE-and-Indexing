Pneumatic vehicle tyre, produced by manufacture, 
more especially a tyre for commercial vehicles, having a 

single- or multiple-ply reinforcing member carcase (1), 
which is secured in the beads (2) by being looped around 

bead cores (3), having core profiles (4) in the beads (2), 

having a tread strip (6) and having a belt reinforcement 
(7) between carcase (1) and tread strip (6), characterised 

in that the carcase (1) is formed from an aramide cord 
fabric, in that the bead cores (3) are constructed from 

aramide filaments, and in that the belt reinforcement (7) 
and the core profiles (4) are formed from synthetic 

fibre-reinforced rubber.
