<ABSTRACT>
In a gearbox unit (1) for insertion between a drive motor (47) and a user (48), consisting of a hydrostatic drive (2) changeable by means of an adjusting device (15a, 15b), a final, particularly mechanical gearbox (4) with several ratios (5, 6) and a control device to change the hydrostatic drive (2) by means of the adjusting device (15a, 15b) for a gear-changing process, the gearbox (4), is a synchronised drive with synchronising devices (7) for the ratios (5, 6), a device (UP, V2) to measure or monitor the drive torque (M) of the hydrostatic drive (2) is allocated to the control device (16) and, when the drive torque (M) is greater than the working torque of the relevant synchronisation device (7, 7a) before a gear-changing operation, the control device (16) sets a drive torque (M) on the hydrostatic drive (2) by means of the adjusting device (15a, 15b) which is the same as or lower than the working torque of the synchronising device allocated to the gear ratio (6, 7) concerned.

Transmission unit (1) for arrangement between a drive 
motor (47) and a consuming device (48), comprising a 

hydrostatic transmission (2), adjustable by means of an 
adjusting device (15a, 15b), a mechanical shift 

transmission (4), functionally arranged downstream of the 
hydrostatic transmission, having a plurality of gears (5, 

6), and a control device for adjusting the hydrostatic 
transmission (2) by means of the adjusting device (15a, 

15b) for a shifting process,
 
characterised in that, 


the shift transmission (4) is a synchronous transmission 
with synchronisation devices (7, 7a) for the gears (5, 6), 

in that, 
a device (U, V2) for the measuring or monitoring of the 
output drive torque (M) of the hydrostatic transmission (2) 

is associated with the control device (16), 
and in that, 
in the event that before a process of gear shifting the 
output drive torque (M) is greater than the working moment 

of the associated synchronisation device (7, 7a) the 
control device (16) sets an output drive torque (M) at the 

hydrostatic transmission (2) by means of the adjustment 
device (15a, 15b), which is equal to or smaller than the 

working moment of the synchronisation device which is 
associated with the relevant gear (6, 7). 
Transmission unit according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that,
 
the device for measuring or monitoring the output drive 

torque (M) has a pressure sensor for determining the 
working pressure of the hydrostatic transmission, which 

sensor generates a corresponding control signal for the 
control device (16). 
Transmission unit according to claims 1 or 2,
  
 

characterised in that,
 
the device for measuring or monitoring the output drive 

torque (M) comprises a measuring device for determination 
of the circulation volume or the through-put volume (V2) in 

particular in the hydraulic motor (14), which generates a 
corresponding control signal for the control device (16). 
Transmission unit according to at least one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the hydraulic pump (13) and/or the hydraulic motor (14) are 

respectively adjustable by means of the adjusting devices 
(15a, 15b). 
Transmission unit according to claim 4,
 
characterised in that,
 
the measuring device is a displacement or displacement 

angle detecting device (25) for detecting the displacement 
or displacement angle. 
Transmission unit according to at least one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that,
 
a speed of rotation detector (26), for detecting the drive 

output speed of rotation of the hydrostatic transmission 
(2) or a corresponding speed of rotation, is provided which 

generates a control signal for the control device (16). 
Transmission unit according to at least one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that,
 
a semi- or fully automatic, preferably electronic control 

device (16, 17) is provided, which is connected with the 
adjusting device or devices (15a, 15b), the pressure 

sensor, the measuring device for the through-put volume, 
the speed of rotation detector and/or a shifting device (9) 

for the shift transmission (4), by means of control or  
 

signal connections. 
Transmission unit according to at least one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the adjusting device (15a, 15b) for the hydraulic pump (13) 

and/or the hydraulic motor (14) has associated therewith a 
respective pressure regulator, which sets such a working 

pressure in the hydrostatic transmission (2) that its 
output drive moment (11) is equal to or smaller than the 

working moment of the corresponding synchronisation device 
(7, 7a). 
Transmission unit according to at least one of the 
preceding claims,
 
characterised in that
 
the hydrostatic transmission (2) comprises a plurality of 

hydraulic motors (14, 14a) in the form of constant motors
