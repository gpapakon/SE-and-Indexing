<ABSTRACT>
The sterile-filtration filter described comprises a pressure vessel (1) with one or more rod-shaped filter elements (2) consisting of a hollow cylinder (3) containing a self-supporting filtering agent (4) and a central tube (5) located so that it can be removed. The design permits inspection and cleaning of the filter elements without opening the filter container.

<CLAIMS>
A filter for the sterile filtration of suspensions, 
consisting Of a pressure vessel (1) with one or more candle-shaped 

filter members (2), which are formed from a hollow 
body (3) with a self-supporting filter means (4) and a 

central tube (5), characterised in that the hollow body (3) 
is constructed in its lower part as filter means (4) and in 

its upper part as a closed tube, in which the central tube 
(5) extending over the length of the hollow body (3) is 

removable from the hollow body (3) without the pressure 
vessel having to be opened. 
A filter according to Claim 1, characterised in that in 
the upper third of the hollow body (3) a flange (8) is 

provided. 
A filter according to Claims 1 and 2, characterised in 
that the hollow body (3) carries on its end face a flange 

(11) at a distance from the flange (12). 
A filter according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
the hollow body (3) carries on its free end face a closure 

cap (13). 
A filter according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the closure cap (13) is provided with a semicircular recess 

(14). 
A filter according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the closure cap (13) is provided with a condensate outlet. 
A filter according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the closure cap (13) has a groove (17). 
A filter according to Claim 4, characterised in that 
the closure cap (13) has a bore (16).
