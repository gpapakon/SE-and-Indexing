<ABSTRACT>
In a process for enclosing substrates, in particular for enclosing cable splices or cable ends, a tube of an elastomeric material which is expanded in the radial direction and is kept in the expanded state by a clamping means in the form of a plastic tube bonded to the outer surface of the said elastomeric tube is arranged around the substrate and, for the purpose of making the tube recover its original shape, the bond between the surface of the tube and the clamping means is brought to an end. To do so, the plastic tube is cooled to a temperature below the ambient temperature and the said plastic tube is thereby destroyed.

Process for sheathing substrates (1), in particular 
for sheathing cable splices or cable ends, in which 

a tube (3) of elastomeric material which is expanded in 
the radial direction and is maintained in the expanded 

state by a bracing means, which is in the form of a tube 
(4) made of plastic that can be made to break up and is 

connected to the outer surface of the tube (3), is 
arranged around the substrate (1), and in which, for the 

purpose of recovery of the tube, the connection between 
the surface of the tube and the bracing means is eliminated, 

characterized in that, for the purpose of destroying 
the plastic tube, the latter is cooled to a temperature 

below ambient temperature. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the plastic tube (4) is treated with a cooled 

medium. 
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that a cooled medium is blown or sprayed against the 

plastic tube (4). 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that the plastic tube (4) is sprayed 

with liquified gas or dry ice. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the cooling treatment is continued 

until the plastic tube (4) is destroyed owing to internal 
stresses. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the plastic tube (4) is exposed to 

a mechanical load after the cooling treatment.  
 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterized in that the plastic tube (4) is treated 

with a cold spray. 
Process according to one of Claims 1 to 7, 
charac
terized in that the connection between the tube (3) 
and the plastic tube (4) is eliminated by an adhesive 

situated between tube (3) and plastic tube (4) being 
destroyed as a result of embrittlement and/or radial 

shrinkage of the plastic tube (4) owing to the cooling.
