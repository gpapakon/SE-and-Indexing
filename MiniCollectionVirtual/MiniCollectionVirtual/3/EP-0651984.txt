<ABSTRACT>
A medical adhesive sheet comprising a support 
having a laminate structure comprising a non-porous sheet 

and a porous-sheet, and a pressure-sensitive layer 
comprising an acrylic polymer prepared by polymerizing an 

alkyl (meth)acrylate as a main component monomer, and an 
organic liquid component which is compatible with the 

acrylic polymer, formed on the porous sheet side of the 
support, the layer being subjected to a crosslinking 

treatment, wherein the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is 
embedded in the porous sheet, reaching the laminate 

interface between the non-porous sheet and the porous 
sheet. The medical adhesive sheet has improved anchoring 

property of its pressure-sensitive adhesive layer to the 
support while exhibiting a good balance between adhesion to 

the skin and low irritation to the skin.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a medical adhesive
sheet which can be adhered to a skin for protection of the
skin or for continuous administration of a drug for
percutaneous absorption into a living body to treat or
prevent various diseases.Various types of so-called adhesive tape-like
medical adhesive sheets comprising a support such as a
nonwoven sheet or a plastic film having formed on
one surface thereof a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer
have been proposed as dressings for protection of the
affected part of the skin or for administration of a drug
for treating a disease or for prevention through a skin
surface.It is required for those medical adhesive sheets
to have adhesiveness to the skin to some extent to prevent
falling the same off the skin surface to which the sheet is
applied. However, a physical irritation increases in
peeling and removing the sheet from the skin surface as the
adhesiveness to the skin increases, and a pain or a peeling
of stratum corneum tends to occur. As a result, there is
the possibility to give unnecessary irritation or damage to
the skin surface, thereby giving a pain to a user. It is therefore necessary to appropriately
decrease the adhesiveness to the skin in relationship with
decrease of the skin irritation, and the adhesiveness to
the skin is sacrificed in a certain degree, or the
insufficient adhesiveness to the skin is supplemented by
covering with an adhesive sheet separately prepared.The medical adhesive sheets are also required to
have, besides the appropriate adhesiveness, cohesiveness of
the adhesive layer and an anchoring property of the
adhesive layer to the support for preventing the adhesive
from remaining on the skin on removal (adhesive remaining
phenomenon). In particular, where the adhesive layer
contains a drug for percutaneous absorption, the drug
should have stability with time (insusceptibility to
decomposition) in the adhesive layer and releasability from
that layer (percutaneous absorbability). Thus, development
of medical adhesive sheets must be undertaken with due
consideration for these various factors. EP-A-0569862 (relevant with respect to Art. 54(3) EPC)
discloses a medical adhesive sheet comprising a support
comprising a laminate of a polyester film having a
thickness of from 0.5 to 6 µm and a polyester nonwoven
fabric having a basis weight of from 5 to 20 g/m2, and
a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer laminated on the
surface of the nonwoven fabric.The present inventors had been devoted to develop
a low-irritating medical adhesive sheet,
