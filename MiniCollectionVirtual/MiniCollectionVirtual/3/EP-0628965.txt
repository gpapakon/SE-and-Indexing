<ABSTRACT>
Cassette (1, 61) having a plurality of sizes are provided, 
each size cassette being arranged for use with a common cassette 

recording/reproducing apparatus (201). Each size cassette includes a 
cassette case holding a recording medium therein, an information device 

for providing information pertaining to the respective cassette to the 
cassette recording/reproducing apparatus when the respective cassette 

is being used with the cassette recording/reproducing apparatus, and a 
reference hole for positioning the cassette case in the cassette 

recording/reproducing apparatus. The reference hole and the 
information device have a constant positional relationship therebe
tween 
regardless of the size of the cassette. A recording/reproducing 

apparatus for use with such cassettes is also provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to recording/reproducing
apparatus and cassettes therefor. Cassettes having a plurality of
different sizes are provided for use with a common
recording/reproducing apparatus. Each such cassette has, for example,
a connector with a plurality of exposed terminals for transferring
informational data and a reference hole for receiving a positioning
member of the recording/reproducing apparatus so as to improve the
positional accuracy between a connector on the recording/reproducing
apparatus and the connector of the respective cassette, thereby
facilitating proper contact of the terminals upon insertion of each
cassette into the recording/reproducing apparatus.Recently, cassettes having a recording medium therein, such as
magnetic tape, have been proposed which include a plurality of
terminals which are exposed on a cassette case thereof to provide
information relating to the respective cassette. For example, such
information may pertain to the contents of signals recorded on the
recording medium, the type of the recording medium, a write protect or
write enable condition of the recording medium, and so forth. Such
information is supplied to the recording/reproducing apparatus after
insertion of the respective cassette into the recording/reproducing 
apparatus to enable the recording/reproducing apparatus to
satisfactorily perform a desired control operation(s) to ensure
optimum recording and reproducing operation(s).Typically, the plurality of terminals are arranged in
an area on the back surface of the cassette case of the tape
cassette. Such back surface of the cassette case normally
provides an optimum location for arranging such terminals.
However, such back surface may also be used for affixing a label
thereto.A recording/reproducing apparatus for use with tape
cassettes having a plurality of different sizes, such as the
recently proposed tape cassettes having a plurality of terminals
described above, has been proposed.Although the above-described recording/reproducing
apparatus is adapted for use with the above different sized tape
cassettes having a plurality of terminals, properly positioning
each such tape cassette in the recording/reproducing apparatus so
that the terminals are disposed correctly relative to the
connector of the recording/reproducing apparatus may be extremely
difficult. To compensate for such difficulty, the terminals may
be arranged so as to have larger intervals therebetween which
provide an allowance for a positional tolerance between the
terminal
