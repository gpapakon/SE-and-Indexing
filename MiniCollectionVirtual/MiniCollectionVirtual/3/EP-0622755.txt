<ABSTRACT>
A page printer (12) is connected to a computer (10) by a standard 
input/output interface (14) that enables a predetermined data transfer rate of 

raster pixel image data. The page printer (12) includes a print engine (34) for 
printing raster pixel data on a page at a constant rate that is greater than the 

predetermined data transfer rate. The printer's processor (30) allocates a 
portion of printer RAM (38) as a buffer (42) for receiving raster pixel image data 

from a host computer (10). The RAM buffer (42) is sized to hold an initial 
quantity of raster pixel image data that comprises a portion of a page. The 

printer's processor (30) causes the print engine (34) to commence printing of a 
page when the RAM buffer (42) contains the initial portion of received raster 

pixel image data. The predetermined data transfer rate then enables transfer to 
RAM (38) of sufficient additional raster pixel image data to enable the print 

engine (34) to complete printing of the page without stopping - after the initial 
quantity of raster pixel data has been printed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to page printers, and more particularly, to a
page printer that receives raster data via a standard input/output interface, the
page printer employing a limited-size raster buffer, and while enabling its print
mechanism to operate with high efficiency.Most laser printers receive data to be printed from a host computer
in the form of a control language over a standard interface. The control
language data stream includes print function commands with interspersed print
data. The laser printer responds by converting the received data stream into a
list of simple commands, called display commands which describe what must be
printed. The printer processes the display commands and renders the described
objects into a raster bit map. This procedure generally requires a full page raster
bit map memory, as the same memory is used for succeeding pages.Many methods have been implemented to reduce the amount of
required memory in a laser printer. Some methods require an analysis of the
incoming signal stream to determine if the data contained therein (e.g. raster
graphics data) exceeds a threshold of available storage in the printer's video
buffer. In such case, a compression technique is employed to compress the
raster image data so as to enable more efficient use of the available raster
buffer space. In U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 07/940,111, published as US 5.479.587, entitled
"Page Printer Having Adaptive Data Compression for Memory Minimization", of
Campbell et al, a number of compression techniques are applied to an input
data flow, depending upon which technique provides a greater level of
compression. In U.S. Patent Application Serial Number 07/939,795, published as US 5.483.622, entitled
"Page Printer Having Automatic Font Compression" to Zimmerman et al, a page
printer is described that has the ability to determine when a received font will
require an excessive amount of buffer memory. In such a case, the printer 
compresses the font data to again enable more efficient use of available raster
buffer space.The use of control languages to enable data transfers between
host computers and laser printers is widespread and must be accommodated on
a commercial laser printer if that printer is to appeal to a large customer base.
Such control language data is transferred to the laser printer over a standard,
input/output (I/O) interface that exhibits a rather slow data transfer rate. One
known standard interface is called the "Centronics" interface and enables data
transfers to
