<DESCRIPTION>
 (Hetero)-aryl ketones derivatives with antibacterial propertiesThis invention relates to a novel class of compounds having antibacterial and antimycoplasmal activity, to processes for their preparation and to their use in human and veterinary medicine, and also to intermediates for use in the preparation of such compounds.Mupirocin, the compound of formula (A):(A) exhibits good activity against Gram positive bacteria, H. influenzae, Legionella and mycoplasma. It is marketed as a topical formulation by Beecham Group p.l.c. under the Trade Mark 'Bactroban'. Mupirocin (formerly known as pseudomonic acid A) is rapidly hydrolysed in vivo to monic acid A, the compound of formula (B):(B) which is inactive.Various proposals have been made in the past to improve the metabolic stability of mupirocin with respect to enzymatic hydrolysis, by modification of the C-l ester functional group, for instance, by changing it to a C-l heterocyclic derivative (EP-A-0087 953 and EP-A-0 123 578, Beecham Group) or to a C-l amide (EP-A-0 001 914. Beecham Group). In addition, EP-A-0029665 (Beecham Group) discloses derivatives of monic acids A, B and C characterised in having a ketone functionality at C-l. including inter alia aryl and heterocyclic ketones. More recently, Klein et al have reported (in a poster presented at the Third Annual Chemical Congress of North America. Toronto. June 1988. some aspects of which are also discussed in J. Med. Chem. 1989, 32, 151) the preparation and propeπies of a limited group of C-l aryl and heteroaryl ketones. It has now been surrjrisinεlv found that enhanced antibacterial activity 

may be obtained if an element of conformational rigidity is introduced about the carbonyl moiety of a C-l aryl or heteroaryl ketone. Improvements to in vitro activity and in vivo stability m^tbe observed.Accordingly, the preserføinvention provides a compound of formula (I):(I) in which X denotes the residue of an aryl or a heteroaryl ring.Suitably the aryl ring of which X forms a residue is benzene or naphthalene and preferably benzene, which may be unsubstituted or substituted by up to four, preferably up to two substituents.Suitably the heteroaryl ring of which X forms a residue includes both single and fused rings, with each ring suitably comprising up to four heteroatoms each selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, which rings may be unsubstituted or substituted by, for example, up to three substituents. Each heteroaryl ring may have from 4 to 7, preferably 5 or 6, ring atoms. A fused heteroaryl ring
