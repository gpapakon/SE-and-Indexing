<DESCRIPTION>
Compact discs have been a unique article of com­
merce for the last few years. This new information 
storage device utilizes a laser beam for reading the 
information stored therein by the reflection of the 
laser off a metallic layer through a material which has 
molded in data bits in the form of pits and lands. The 
data bit pattern alters the intensity of the reflected 
laser to produce digital information. Materials used 
in the compact discs have been various plastics such as 
polymethylmethacrylate and polycarbonate. Polycarbon­
ates employed in this application are described in 
U.S.P. 4,514,357 wherein a very low molecular weight 
bisphenol-A polycarbonate, the average molecular weight 
from about 12,000 to 18,000, is employed as the plastic 
material message carrier. Accurate pit reflection and 
minimum birefringence in the compact disc requires the 
use of a plastic material which has great flowability, 
or in other words, a very low melt viscosity. Dimen­
sional stability and ductility are also important 
product attributes. Also desirable is excellent pro­
cessability of the material as manifested by minimum 
cycle time. Various polycarbonates have been utilized in the 
compact disc area. A recently issued U.S.P. 4,734,488, 
discloses a polycarbonate which must have an aryl or 
aralkyl group attached to the carbon atom separating 
the two phenols and a low molecular weight. The afore­
mentioned U.S.P. 4,514,357 provides further examples of 
such materials, specifically bisphenol-A polycarbonate. 
The example of the end group used in the aforementioned 
'357 patent is a paratertiary butyl phenol.  It has now been found that paracumylphenol end­
capped polycarbonate with a certain melt viscosity 
range as measured by Kasha Index, provides significant 
advantages over the prior used compact disc materials. 
Advantages include improved ductility as measured by 
1/8 inch Notched Izod impact and decreased cycle time. In accordance with the invention there is a para­
cumylphenol endcapped polycarbonate having a melt vis­
cosity range of from about 2800 to about 3400 centi­
seconds as measured by Kasha Index. It is preferable 
to use a bisphenol-A polycarbonate. It is also prefer­
able to have a Kashi Index from about 2900 to about 
3100. A further aspect of the invention is an article 
having excellent characteristics molded from the poly­
carbonate described above such as lenses laser read 
information carriers and the like. It is preferred 
that the article be in a disc shape and have a diameter
