<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process of coating a molded 
article of an olefinic resin. More particularly, it relates to a process of 
coating a molded article of an olefinic resin which process is capable of 
forming a finishing coating layer in a single coating process without 
washing the surface of the molded article and without coating the 
surface of the molded article with a primer as undercoat. For automobile bumpers, protective strips and the like, 
compositions containing polypropylene (PP) and ethylene-propylene 
rubber (EPR) have heretofore been used as materials. Polypropylene has 
very inferior property for coating because it has no polar group in the 
molecule and is chemically inert. For coating of a bumper made of such 
a composition, degreasing and etching treatment with trichloroethane or 
the like is indispensable. This situation is not limited to coating of 
automobile bumpers. For coating of an article made of a polypropylenic 
composite material, it is general practice that the article is processed 
with pretreatment of etching with trichloroethane to obtain practical 
coating strength (refer to Shosaku Yamamoto and Mikio Uchida, 
Jitsumu Hyomen Gijutsu, Vol. 31, Number 10, Page 440 (1984)). However, trichloroethane causes environmental destruction, such 
as ozonosphere destruction, and thus, a method using trichloroethane in 
the coating process must be avoided.  As materials to replace trichloroethane, surface active agents in 
the form of alkaline aqueous solutions can be mentioned. However, these 
surface active agents show low washing and dissolving ability when they 
are applied to PP and cannot be used for coating of an article made of a 
polypropylenic composite material, such as the composition described 
above and the like. Because of the situation described above, the coating property of 
molded articles of olefinic resins like polypropylene has been improved 
both with respect to the coating material and with respect to the resin 
composition. As the improvement with respect to the coating material, resins or 
coating materials having good adhesion to the surface of molded articles 
of olefinic resins are disclosed. Examples of such resins and coating 
materials are a mixture of a chlorinated olefinic resin and acrylic resin 
(Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Showa 62(1987)-200438), a 
resin system in which an isocyanate compound is used in combination 
with a copolymer of a chlorinated olefinic resin and acrylic monomer
