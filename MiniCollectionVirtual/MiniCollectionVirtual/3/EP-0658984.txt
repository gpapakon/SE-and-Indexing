<ABSTRACT>
A varying number of bits needed to perceptually encode (in 250) a 
constant time portion of an audio and/or video (including images) signal (from 100) 

permits the signal to be combined with a second signal (204) to generate output 
blocks (from 700). These audio/or video signals may be generally described as 

signals that are encoded according to a perceptual encoding technique. A method of 
forming a digital output signal comprises inputting a first signal and a second signal 

into a digital output signal former (700) and selectively combining a set of 
information with the first signal to generate a set of superblocks.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the efficient utilization of allocated 
bandwidth of a transmission medium by a signal representing, for example, a digital 
audio signal. One way to digitally encode an audio signal is to use perceptual audio 
coding (PAC). For a given audio signal, a PAC system will produce a digital 
representation of the audio signal that, on average, is in more of a compressed form 
(i.e., represented by fewer bits) than a digital representation of the same audio signal 
produced by other known types of digital encoding. There are many different types of PAC systems. However, the thread 
that is common to all PAC systems is the concept of not coding audio information 
that would be, when decoded, perceptually irrelevant (i.e., unable to be heard by a 
listener). This broad concept is described in U.S. Patent Application Serial 
No. 08/109,867 entitled "Perceptual Coding of Audio Signals," by J. L. Hall and 
J. D. Johnston, filed August 20, 1993 (claiming a filing date, via continuations, of 
December 30, 1988 to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 07/292,598, now 
abandoned), hereby incorporated by reference as if set forth in its entirety. The 
amount of perceptually irrelevant information in an audio signal may vary greatly 
over time. On average, due to greater compression, a constant time portion of the 
audio signal with a lesser amount of perceptually relevant information requires fewer 
bits for a PAC system to encode than another constant time portion of the same 
audio signal with a larger amount of perceptually relevant information. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, we define a difference 
between a number of bits available to perceptually encode a constant time portion of 
a first signal and a number of bits actually used to encode the constant time portion 
of the first signal. Absent the insertion of additional bits, the bandwidth allocated 
output will not be fully utilized. Thus, the difference in bits is filled with other 
signals containing information. More specifically, the first signal is comprised of a plurality of blocks, 
each representing a constant time portion of the first signal. The plurality of blocks 
is denoted with the subscript "i." Each block is assigned a predetermined number  
 
Ni, wherein Ni is a maximum number of bits allowed to encode the ith block. 
However, since the block is encoded according to a perceptual coding technique, the 
number of bits actually used to encode the ith block, namely NUi, may not utilize all 
Ni bits
