<ABSTRACT>
The subject is a head for a golf club that can be 
based on a specific design, but the head is to 

have improvements incorporated in order to remove 
or diminish the vibrations caused by the movement 

of the head until it impacts with the ball. These 
improvements are the placing on the side of the 

head (4) opposite to that on which the impact occurs (12), 
of some deep cavities (7) that begin at the edge (9) 

defined by the flows round the head as it moves. 
These cavities (7) are parallel to the edges of the 

rear face and are joined by a central spine (8) that 
separates them.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention refers to the sporting sector and 
specifically to the game of golf. Regarding the simple design of the heads of 
golf clubs, numerous designs exist which are protected at 
the level of industrial models, but with regard to the 
scientific study of the design, we are aware of Patent of 
Invention nº 4 653 756 in the USA, applied for on 
25.10.85 (application nº 791.207) by GOLF CLUB IRON, 
and the USA Patent 4.444.392 by GOLF DRIVER CLUB HEAD. The Patents that were cited during its 
processing were numbers 1.690.388 WALDRON in the USA and 
3.976.299 LAWRENCE et al., in the USA. As already mentioned, the object of the present 
invention is: AN IMPROVED GOLF CLUB HEAD. But the improvement results from a specific 
application of the contents claimed in Spanish Patent nº 
9300372 for IMPROVED FUSELAGE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE 
STABILIZATION EFFECTS IN AIR VORTICES that was also 
deposited in the name of the present applicant for the 
patent on: In order to apply the principles and claims of the 
said Spanish Patent, the head of a golf club is 
considered as a SOLID BODY that moves within a FLUID 
which is the air. The said head of the golf club will 
have the corresponding design, according to its function 
and in accordance with what up to now has been considered  
 
as an acceptable aerodynamic line for its use 
to strike against the corresponding ball. The improvement studied here and applied to the 
said head of the golf club, will have an influence on the 
design of the fuselage which is defined by all the air 
flows that determine the release and consequent drag 
strength and also vibrations. Similarly, with the said 
fuselage design applied to the head of a golf club, a 
great part of the vibrations will be avoided that are 
currently caused by successive air vortices generating 
turbulence in the rear zone of the said gold club head, 
thus increasing the precision with which the golf club is 
used. Figure 1 shows a representation of the section 
(1) of the head of a golf club (2). When this golf club 
(2) is in use the head moves through the air in a curved 
trajectory according to (3), so that its face (12) hits 
on the corresponding ball. During this movement of the head (1), flows (5) 
are produced that fall from and drag the head in 
question. These falling flows (5) 
determine the shape of the surface (4) that will 
be specifically the face of the 
head (1) that is opposite that of the face (12) and will 
be the place where the pertinent fuselage is to be applied. As mentioned, in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
Golf club head to be placed on a shaft for the 
practise of the game of golf, comprising a striking 

face (12) a body (1) extending rearwardly from the 
striking face and a rear face (4) opposite the said 

striking face, said rear face comprising an aerodynamic 
trailing edge (9), characterised in that said rear 

face is shaped to include two elongated horizontally 
extending cavities (7) of deep curvature and a central 

rib (8) separating the said two cavities. 
Golf club head according to claim 1, in which 
two lateral communication channels (10) at respective 

ends of the said central rib (8) provide communication 
between the said cavities (7).
