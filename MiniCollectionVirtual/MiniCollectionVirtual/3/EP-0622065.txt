<ABSTRACT>
For a bathing aid which comprises a seat which can be hydraulically lowered and raised in a bath tub and pivoted out of the bath tub, it is provided, as a simple, space-saving design, that a column (3) of hydraulic cylinders (5, 6, 7) which can be telescopically moved inside one another and are solely actuated by the pressure of tap water be firmly mounted on the ground to the sides next to the top of the bath tub (2), and that a side-arm (9) which can be pivoted about at least 90@ be fastened with low friction on the top (8) of the uppermost hydraulic cylinder (7). The seat (10) with its back rest is hinged on the free end of the side-arm.

A bathing aid device comprising a seat (10) arranged
to be lowered and raised telescopingly and swivelled out

of a bath tub (2), wherein a column (3) composed of
hydraulic cylinders telescoping into each other and

actuable by mere tap water pressure is, in use, mounted
firmly on the floor beside the head of the bath tub (2),

and a transversal beam (9) is fixed to the top end (8)
of the uppermost hydraulic cylinder such that the

transversal beam (9) can be swivelled through at least
90Â° with low friction, the free end of the transversal

beam (9) carrying the back of the seat (10),
characterised in that the hydraulic cylinder column (3)

is composed of a lower, stationary hydraulic cylinder
(5) and a plurality of further hydraulic cylinders (6,

7) displaceable within the stationary hydraulic cylinder
(5).
The bathing aid device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the column (3) composed of the

hydraulic cylinders (5, 6, 7) is braced, in use, to the
rim of the bath tub (2) through a lateral arm fixed to

the lowermost, stationary hydraulic cylinder (5).
The bathing aid device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the top end (8) of the uppermost

hydraulic cylinder (7) is arranged to be raised to a
total height of at least 1000 mm.
The bathing aid device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the seat (10) is provided with a

manual control valve for raising, lowering and
swivelling the seat (10).
The bathing aid device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the raising force of the hydraulic

cylinders (5, 6, 7) is approximately 150 kg.
The bathing aid device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the transversal beam (9) is

supported on the top end (8) of the uppermost hydraulic
cylinder (7) by ball bearings.
The bathing aid device according to claims 1 and 6,
characterised in that the transversal beam (9) is

arranged to be driven and swivelled by a water motor.
The bathing aid device according to claim 7, characterised
in that the water motor is mounted in the transversal

beam (9) and is arranged to act on a pinion which
is operatively connected to a gear ring surrounding the

uppermost hydraulic cylinder (7).
The bathing aid device according to claim 8,
characterised in that the gear ring is provided with

limit stops arranged to limit the swivelling angle of
the transversal beam (9).
The bathing aid device according to claim 1,
characterised in that the guided length of each

hydraulic cylinder (6, 7) within the respective guiding
hydraulic cylinder (5, 6) enclosing it is at least three

times the diameter thereof.
