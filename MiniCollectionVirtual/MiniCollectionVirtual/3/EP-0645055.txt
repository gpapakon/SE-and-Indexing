<ABSTRACT>
A sensor element that is adapted to respond to radiation, and which is adapted to the manufacture of a sensor array is manufactured into a single crystal semi-conductor means such as silicon. An anisotropically etched pit is provided under the sensing surface, and the pit generally corresponds to the geometry of the sensor element. The geometry is selected to be rectangular and falls along a selected orientation of the particular crystalline structure used for manufacture of the device to thereby allow a high density of sensor elements to provide an efficient array.

<DESCRIPTION>
The production of exceedingly small sensing and control devices has
been developed to a high state of perfection over the last 30 years. In the last 30
years, the manufacture of mass-produced microelectronic circuits on silicon wafers
has become the forerunner of the production of various other devices by similar
manufacturing techniques. The fabrication of novel three-dimensional microelectronic
devices in a semiconductor crystal, typically silicon, has been accomplished by
fabricating the device through many techniques including isotropic and anisotropic
etching. These techniques utilize the crystalline structure of a single crystal
semiconductor. The techniques had evolved to the point where devices that are only a
few Âµm (a few thousandths of an inch) in dimension are manufactured in quantity.The state of the art generally can be found in
a number of published articles and related patent applications. The
citation of this type of article in the present text is provided as technical background.Articles of particular interest are found in. IEEE Transactions on
Electronics Devices, Volume ED-25, No. 10, October 1978, at pages 1178 and 1241.
The article appearing at page 1178 is entitled "Fabrication of Novel Three-dimensional 
Microstructures by the Anisotropic Etching of (100) and
(110) Silicon" by E. Bassous. The article appearing at page 1241 is
entitled "Dynamic Micromechanics on Silicon: Techniques and Devices"
by K. E. Petersen. Also of interest as general background is an article
entitled "Silicon Micromechanical Devices" which was published on
pages 36-47 of the April 1983 issue of Scientific American.The articles and pending application referenced above show clearly
that it is old, and the technique well-known, to manufacture
mircomechanical devices by etching into a single crystal silicon. The
etching techniques generally rely on obtaining the maximum speed of
etching, and as such, the planes within the crystal typically dictate the
orientation of the device on the surface of the structure. The dictation of
the orientation of the manufactured device on the surface of a single
crystal silicon provides a utilitarian way of producing certain individual
devices. Typically, the silicon structure is separated after manufacture so
that the individual devices can be utilized separately and the orientation of
the device with respect to the crystalline structure usually leaves unused
surfaces of the silicon crystal. Sometimes these unused surfaces are
adapted for use as an area upon which integrated

<CLAIMS>
A method of manufacturing an integrated micromechanical sensor
element to respond to radiation, as part of an array of sensor elements, on

a generally flat surface of a single crystal semiconductor means (10),
including the steps of providing radiation sensing means (12) having at

least two leadout means (14, 15) at said semiconductor surface, the
method characterised by exposing at least two separate surface areas (20,

21) on said semiconductor surface with said surface areas, in a major
plane of the sensor element parallel to the generally flat surface, together

semi-enclose said sensing means about a periphery thereof and defining at
least two leadout areas, said surface areas having sides that lie along and

perpendicular to orientation [110] of said specific crystalline structure of

the semiconductor means, each of said leadout areas providing a support
upon which one each of said sensor leadout means are located;

anisotropically etching a pit being limited in size by (111) planes within
said single crystal semiconductor means, whereby said planes intersect

said surface areas which semi-enclose said sensing means about a
periphery thereof in order to define a perimeter of said pit to correspond

with said surface areas; and completing the processing of said radiation sensing
means.
A method as described in Claim 1 characterised by forming
separate surface areas (20, 21) displaced from each other to provide said

leadout areas (16, 17) and said separate areas to effectively interlock in
directions along and perpendicular to orientation [110]
 of said specific

crystalline structure. 
A method as described in Claim 1 or 2 characterised by forming
said areas (20, 21) each shaped to include at least two inner corners.
A method as described in any preceding claim characterised by
forming said surface areas (20, 21) to each include a pair of parallel legs

(46, 47, 50, 51) and a connecting bight (48, 52) that is generally
perpendicular to said legs.
A method as described in any preceding claim characterised by
forming each of said surface areas (20, 21) to be substantially the same in

configuration and size with a leg and a bight of each surface area
generally adjacent to a separate side of said sensing means.
A method as described in any preceding claim characterised by
forming each of said surface areas substantially of the same configuration

but of different sizes so that the legs of a first of said surface areas fit
between the legs of a second of said surface areas with the bights of both

surface areas generally parallel in position while being on opposite sides
of said sensing means, said legs of said surface areas defining said two

leadout areas.
A method as described in claims 4-6 characterised by
forming said legs of said surface areas to define said two leadout areas,

said two leadout areas being of minimum size to support said sensor
means over said pit while providing support for said sensor leadout

means.
A method as described in any preceding claim characterised by
forming said surface areas (70, 71, 72, 73) four in number and 

substantially the same in configuration, one each of said surface areas
being adjacent a side of said sensing means, and adjacent edges of said

surface areas defining said two leadout areas.
A method as described in claims 4-8 characterised by
forming said legs of said surface areas to define said two leadout areas,

said two leadout areas being of minimum size to support said sensor
means over said pit while providing support for said sensor leadout

means.
