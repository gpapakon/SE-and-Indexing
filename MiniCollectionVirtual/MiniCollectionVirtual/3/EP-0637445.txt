first 
12
, second 
14
 and third 
16
 members each having a 
surface 
18

20
 therein. 
Througholes 
20
 have a diameter somewhat greater than 
the thickness of the solid compact medicament 
(A)
 and 
the interior wall 
22
 of the througholes 
20
 has an axial 
length smaller than the length of the solid compact 

medicament. First and third members 
12,16
 are fixed 
relative to one another. Second member 
14
 is 
displaceable between first and third members 
12,16
 
between a first position wherein the througholes 
20
 in 
members 
12,14,16
 are aligned thereby defining an open 
gripping jaw 
24
 for receiving and subsequently 
releasing the solid compact medicament 
(A)
, to a second 
position wherein the second member 
14
 firmly engages a 
circumferential portion of solid compact medicament 
(A)
 
thereby engagingly capturing solid compact medicament 


(A)
 in partially closed gripping jaw 
24
 for processing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an apparatus for
holding a solid compact medicament dosage form.
More particularly, the invention concerns a solid
compact medicament holding apparatus in which
overlapping portions of the medicament, such as a
caplet, are exposed to a coating process to produce a
coated solid compact medicament which resembles a
conventional capsule.In the marketing of solid compact
medicaments, there is a clear consumer preference for a
shiny, capsule-like, single or multiple color solid
dosage form that is easy to swallow. Generally,
gelatinous coatings have been used to achieve a shiny
surface on a solid dosage form, also referred to herein
as a caplet, pill, tablet, and the like. Caplets are
solid, substantially cylindrical shaped medicaments;
pills are solid, substantially round shaped
medicaments; and, tablets are solid, substantially
spherical shaped medicaments (see for reference Seitz
et al., "Tablet Coating", Chapter 12, Page 346, The
Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy). One
method of making caplets which has been used to meet
the needs of the pharmaceutical consumer is described
and illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 4,965,089 to Sauter
et al, and U.S. Patent Nos. 4,990,358 and 4,921,108,
both to Berta et al. In particular, Sauter '089 and
Berta '358 each teaches a method and apparatus for
holding and dipping one end portion of a caplet into a
gelatin pool and then positioning the caplet so as to
dip the uncoated end portion of the caplet into a 
second gelatin Pool of a different color. However, a
major drawback of the apparatus and methods taught in
these patents is that a constant force spring is relied
upon to hold the caplet during the dip coating process
and also during caplet transfer to other processing
steps, such as drying and packaging. As can be readily
appreciated, such a constant spring force could impart
a shear force which would be unacceptably large on some
abrasion sensitive material included in solid compact
medicaments. Acetyl salicylic acid, also known as
aspirin, and gelatinous coatings which have not been
completely cured, are two examples of abrasion
sensitive materials which could be damaged by such
shear force. US-A-4 500 126 discloses
a gripping device especially for gripping thin wall tubes comprising a first
flexible gripping member having two spaced loops adapted to enclose one side of an object, and a
second flexible gripping member having a third loop for enclosing a second side of the object. In
use, the gripping members are moved away from each

Apparatus for holding a solid compact medicament dosage form (A) having a
predetermined diameter and axial length characterized in that:


first (12), second (14) and third (16) members, each member having a surface (18)
with at least one throughole (20) therein, each said throughole (20) having a

diameter greater than the thickness of said solid compact medicament dosage form
(A)

for which the apparatus is intended
and an interior wall (22) having an axial length less than the length of said solid

compact medicament dosage form (A);
said first member (12) being substantially parallel and fixed relative to said third
member (16) so that througholes (20) in said first (12) and third (16) members are

correspondingly aligned;
said second member (14) being displaceable between said first (12) and third (16)
members from a first position wherein said correspondingly aligned througholes (20)

in said first (12) and third (16) members are in alignment with said throughole (20) in
said second member (14), said aligned througholes (20) defining an open gripping

jaw (24) for receiving and subsequently releasing said solid compact medicament
dosage form (A) from said first (12), second (14) and third (16) members; to a

second position wherein said throughole (20) in said second member (14) is

sized to accommodate an end portion of the solid compact medicament dosage

form (A).
The apparatus recited in claim 3 characterized in that said stop plate (26) is
adjustable relative to said gripping jaw (24).
The apparatus recited in claim 1 characterized in that said second member (14)
is displaceable along a fixed axis between said first (12) and third (16) members. 
The apparatus recited in claim 1 further comprising means for initiating
disengagement of the solid compact medicament dosage form (A) from said

gripping jaw (24).

througholes (20) is provided with means for compliantly engaging the solid compact

medicament dosage form (A).
The apparatus recited in claim 11 characterized in that said compliant means
