<ABSTRACT>
Anti-seizure protection for a threaded joint or sleeve (1), 
particularly suitable for the petroleum sector, comprising a first 

film layer (4) of a copper-zinc alloy anchored to the threads of said 
joint (1) and a second film layer (5) of lead anchored to said first 

layer (4), said anchoring being preferably achieved by ionic 
deposition.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a new anti-seizure protection which 
allows effective and reliable screwing and unscrewing of a 
threaded joint without the use of grease containing powdered lead. As is well known, in the petroleum sector, high corrosion 
resistant pipes constructed of nickel-chromium-molybdenum (Ni-Cr-Mo) 
alloys are connected together at their ends by threaded joints 
or sleeves of the same material, cooperating with corresponding 
threads on the pipes to be connected together. However because of their Ni-Cr-Mo composition, said joints or 
sleeves have a considerable tendency to seize. In the state of the art, this problem is overcome by galvanically 
depositing copper (Cu) or ionically depositing a silver-palladium 
(Ag-Pd) alloy on the threads of said joints. However in either 
case it is necessary to further apply a layer of grease during 
screwing, experimental tests having shown that this grease must 
necessarily contain powdered lead (Pb) to be effective. Recent European Community and American regulations state however 
that for ecological, hygiene and safety reasons, the use of any 
grease containing lead powder is prohibited, the use of such a  
 
grease, which degrades at high operating temperatures, also 
inevitably leaving particulates which increase the risk of seizure 
during unscrewing. The object of the present invention is to obviate said drawbacks 
by providing an anti-seizure protection which does not require the 
use of lubricants containing powdered lead. This is substantially attained by depositing in the form of metal 
ions on the joint threads all those metal particles which are 
generally present in a grease, hence rendering superfluous the 
further use of a lubricant grease of the currently used type. More specifically, a two-layer anti-seizure ionic coating is 
applied to the threads of the joint, namely a first film layer of 
a zinc-copper (Zn-Cu) alloy anchored to the base material of the 
joint to act as a support and anchorage for a second film layer of 
metallic lead for purely anti-seizure purposes. In this manner, said second layer of metallic lead provides 
effective lubrication with low shear resistance, ensuring screwing 
without the need for grease but with the simple use of synthesis 
oil, the effective anchorage achieved for said second layer and 
the very small lead quantity deposited ensuring against even 
minimum lead dispersion into the environment. Hence, the anti-seizure protection for a threaded joint or tubular 
sleeve, particularly suitable for

<CLAIMS>
Anti-seizure protection for a threaded joint or sleeve, 
particularly suitable for the petroleum sector, characterised by 

comprising a first film layer of copper-zinc alloy anchored to the 
base material of the joint and a second film layer of metallic 

lead anchored to said first layer. 
Anti-seizure protection for a threaded joint or sleeve as 
claimed in claim 1, characterised in that said first layer and 

said second layer are anchored respectively to the base material 
of the joint and to the first layer by ionic deposition.
