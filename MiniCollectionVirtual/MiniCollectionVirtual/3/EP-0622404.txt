<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a crystalline
synthetic resin composition, in particular, a
crystalline synthetic resin composition comprising a
synthetic resin compounded with an alkali metal
compound and a basic polyvalent metal salt of a cyclic
organophosphoric ester and having improved
transparency, mechanical properties, etc.Crystalline synthetic resins such as
polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutene-1,
polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene
terephthalate, polyphenylene sulfide and polyamide
have defects that their mold cycling efficiency is low
due to a low crystallization rate after heat melt
molding and that they shrink due to the
crystallization which proceeds after the heat molding.
Other defects of these crystalline synthetic resins
include an insufficient strength and a poor
transparency due to the formation of large crystals.It is known that all of these defects are due to
the crystallinity of the synthetic resins and that the 
defects can be overcome by elevating the
crystallization temperature of the synthetic resins so
that fine crystals can be rapidly formed.It has been known that a nucleating agent or a
crystallization accelerator is added in order to
overcome these defects, and those used heretofore
include metal salts of carboxylic acids, such as
aluminum 4-tert-butylbenzoate and sodium adipate;
metal salts of acidic phosphoric esters, such as
sodium bis(4-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate and sodium
2,2'-methylenebis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate;
and polyhydric alcohol derivatives such as
dibenzylidenesorbitol and bis(4-methylbenzylidene)sorbitol.Among these compounds, metal salts of cyclic
phosphoric esters of alkylidenebisphenols described
in, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos.
1736/1983 and 184252/1984 have remarkable effects and,
therefore, they are widely used.It has also been attempted to improve the effects
of these compounds by combining them with other metal
compounds. For example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.
69853/1988 discloses a method of preventing the
rigidity from being reduced when an alkali metal
aromatic phosphate nucleating agent is used in 
combination with an alkaline earth metal carboxylate
such as calcium stearate by using hydrotalcite or an
alkali metal carboxylate in place of the alkaline
earth metal carboxylate; Japanese Patent Laid-Open
Nos. 129050/1989 and 129051/1989 disclose a method
wherein a combination of a metal salt of a cyclic
organophosphoric ester with a salt of an aliphatic
carboxylic acid with a group II metal of the periodic
tabl
