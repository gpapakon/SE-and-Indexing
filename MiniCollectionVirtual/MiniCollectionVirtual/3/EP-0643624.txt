<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for impregnating alumina-containing catalyst support with platinum. In the method a platinum-containing solution is prepared by using a compound which contains bivalent platinum. The method comprises a stage during which the said platinum-containing solution is oxidized in order to form a solution which contains tetravalent platinum, from which solution platinum is adsorbed on the support.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method according to the preamble of 
Claim 1 for impregnating a catalyst support with platinum. The 
invention also relates to a method for the preparation of a 
catalyst and to a catalyst prepared by this method. The catalyst has a carrier structure to the surface of which 
there has been applied a washcoat of a support material. The 
support used is typically alumina, silica, titanium dioxide, 
zeolite, or mixtures of these. Additives, such as cerium compounds, 
improving the thermal durability of the support are 
additionally used in the support. The support has a large specific 
surface and it constitutes the surface to which the catalytically 
active agent is affixed. Noble metals such as platinum, 
rhodium and palladium are generally used as the catalytically 
active agent. The purpose of platinum is to catalyze in 
particular the oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons to 
carbon dioxide. Typically the amount of platinum used in a 
three-way catalyst per catalyst volume is 0.9 - 3 g/l. The noble metal is added to the support by impregnation. The 
catalyst is dipped or immersed in a solution which contains 
noble metals. The noble metals will adhere to the surface of 
the support. After the impregnation the catalyst is first dried 
at room temperature and thereafter the catalyst is activated, 
for example by heating in a reducing atmosphere. Two methods are generally used in noble metal impregnation. 
These methods are wet impregnation and chemisorption. In wet 
impregnation a completed honeycomb is dipped in a noble metal 
solution, whereupon the liquid is absorbed automatically into 
the honeycomb. Wet impregnation is characterized by a short 
impregnation period and a high noble-metal concentration in the 
solutions. Wet impregnation is based on the adsorption of the  
 
solution. The result is in this case often an uneven 
distribution of the noble metals on the surface of the 
support. In addition, the noble metal is present in the form 
of large particles, in which case the interface between the 
gas and the noble metal remains small, i.e. a poor dispersion 
is obtained. In impregnation based on chemisorption, electric 
forces are exploited for affixing the noble metal complex to 
the surface. Chemisorption is characterized by a long 
impregnation period and a low noble-metal concentration in 
the solutions. The impregnation is based on the noble metal 
compounds being chemically bonded to the surface. In this 
case the noble metal is present on the surface
