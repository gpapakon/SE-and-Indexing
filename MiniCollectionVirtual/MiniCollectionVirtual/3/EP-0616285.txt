<ABSTRACT>
Backing up method for customised data in a communication system, in which customised data in a command stack file are converted and compressed and are stored both on a hard disc (HD) and in a flash memory (FM), triggered by event signals from a time monitoring unit (SW). Following a hard disc (HD) defect and a system failure of the communication installation (K) caused, for example, by a power failure, access can be made back to customised data stored in the flash memory (FM) and said data can then be stored once more in a region of memory (CD) allocated to the microprocessor (CPU) after a "system start-up".

<CLAIMS>
Method for saving data stored in a storage unit 
(CD) of a microprocessor-controlled communications system 

(K), the data being read from the storage unit (CD) 
assigned to the microprocessor and stored in an external 

storage unit (HD) assigned to the communications system 
(K), in accordance with program modules which execute 

save procedures, and in response to a time monitoring 
unit (SW) or input procedures at an operator terminal 

(BT), characterized in that a first program module (AMD 
CDBR). which initiates and monitors the save procedures, 

regularly reads customer data from the storage unit (CD) 
assigned to the microprocessor of the communications 

system and puts these data both in a storage area (SP1) 
of the external storage unit (HD) and in a non-volatile 

storage unit (FM). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that, in conjunction with a second program module (AMO 

REGEN), the customer data are converted into a command-stack 
file and put on the external storage unit (HD). 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that at the instigation of the first program module (AMO 

CDBR), the customer data are read from the external 
storage area (HD) and, after data-compressing program 

procedures put back in a storage area (SP2) of the 
external storage unit (HD) . 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the data of the data-compressed command-stack file 

are stored in the non-volatile storage unit (FM), a flash 
memory. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in  
 

that the data compression is carried out in accordance 
with a delta algorithm. 
Method according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that by means of program procedures of the first program 

module (AMO CDBR), the compressed data of the command-stack 
file are read from the non-volatile storage element 

(FM) and decompressed and in that a third program module 
(AMO GENDB) is prompted by the first program module (AMO 

CDBR) and, because of the program procedures of the third 
program module (AMO GENDB), the decompressed command-stack 

file is read and corresponding customer data are 
created and saved again in the storage area (CD) assigned 

to the microprocessor of the communications system (K).
