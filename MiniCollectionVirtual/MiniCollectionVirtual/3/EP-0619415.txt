<ABSTRACT>
The addition of fibrous materials in intimate 
mixture with particulates for fracturing and gravel 

packing decreases or eliminates the flowback of proppant 
and/or form
ation fines while stabilizing the sand pack 
and lowering the demand for high polymer loadings in the 

placement fluids. Preferred fibers include glass, 
aramide, nylon and other natural and synthetic organic 

and inorganic fibers and metal filaments.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the art of recovery of
hydrocarbon values from subterranean formations, and
more particularly, to a method and means for controlling
the transport of particulate solids in conjunction with
the flow of hydrocarbon fluid from the formation into a
wellbore.Transport of particulate solids during the
production of fluids from a wellbore has long presented
a problem in the recovery of fluid mineral values from
subterranean formations. Such transported particulate
solids cannot only clog the wellbore thereby limiting or
completely stopping fluid production, they represent a
significant wear factor in well production equipment
including pumps and seals used in the recovery process.
Finally, these particulate solids must be separated from
the valuable fluids adding further expense to the
processing of these fluids for use. Particulates which are available for transport in
fluids flowing to the wellbore may be present due to an
unconsolidated nature of the subterranean formation
and/or as a result of various well treatments placing
particulate solids into the formation or the near
wellbore area such as by fracturing and gravel packing.Several means have been attempted in order to
limit or eliminate flowback of particulate proppant
materials placed into the formation in a fracturing
process. One means showing reasonable effectiveness has
been to gradually release fracturing pressure once the
fracturing operation has been completed so that fracture
closure pressure acting against the proppant builds
gradually allowing proppant matrix to stabilize before
fracturing fluid flowback and well production can carry
significant quantities of the proppant out of the
fractures and back to the wellbore. It has also been
common to use so-called "resin-coated proppant", that
is, particulate proppant materials having an adherent
coating bonded to its outer surface so that the proppant
particles are bonded to each other, a process which
further reduces the possibility of proppant flowback.
Since fracturing treatments may employ thousands or even 
millions of pounds of proppant, the use
of expensive, resin-coated proppants is generally
limited to use in the final stages of a fracturing
treatment for economic purposes.In unconsolidated formations, it is common to place
a filtration bed of gravel in the near-wellbore area in
order to present a physical barrier to the transport of
unconsolidated formation fines with the production of
wellbore fluids. Typically, such so-called "gravel packing
operations"
