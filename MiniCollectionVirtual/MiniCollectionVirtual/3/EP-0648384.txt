<ABSTRACT>
A method and apparatus for controlling amplifier output power, in particular, of a transmitter RF amplifier. A representative 4-stage (RF) amplifier is shown at (A) and a control circuit at (B). The control circuit derives from a shaper circuit (IC1, IC2) a control signal(8). This control signal is applied, together with a feedback signal at terminal (5) representative of the emitter current through the final stage amplifier (TR31), to a comparator (IC3) to generate an error signal (12). The error signal (12) is applied to a common amplifier base bias line (3). All stages of the amplifier are in a satured condition so that the effect of the error signal (12) on line (3) is to cause the amplification envelope of the transistors in the (RF) amplifier to follow the error signal, thus generating a pulsed output signal (14) having an envelope shape corresponding to the control signal (8).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method and 
apparatus for controlling the output power of an 
amplifier and in particular to the control of the 
output power of the R.F. amplifier used in a 
transmitter. The specific application envisaged is in the 
transmitter section of the transceiver used in 
cordless telephone units of the type in which 
communication between one or more base units and a 
plurality of portable handset units is achieved by a 
TDD (time division duplex) system in which 
transmission bursts, usually alternated with reception 
windows, are passed between the units. Examples of such prior art are e.g. EP-A-0472 330 and EP-A-0 434 294. The method employed in the present invention as defined 
in the appended claims enables the rise and/or fall times of the transmit 
bursts to be controlled. The method also controls 
gain fluctuations in the transmitter R.F. amplifier 
chain to give a constant output level. The method of the invention involves deriving 
a feedback signal representative of the flow of dc 
current through at least one of the transistors in the 
R.F. amplifier, comparing this feedback signal with a 
reference signal having a desired envelope shape to 
produce an error signal, and thence using said error 
signal to control the gain of the R.F. amplifier. The method of the invention is realised by 
controlling the current through the signal amplifier 
so that the amplifier is in a state of saturation. 
This limits the output level that can be produced; 
in other words, the output power from the amplifier 
is limited by the current supplied to it and not by 
the gain of the amplifier. In the preferred 
embodiment, the current through at least one stage of  
 
the signal amplifier is constantly compared to a 
reference current so that the current through the 
amplifier may be maintained at a fixed value compared 
to the value of the reference current. Thence, if 
the value of this reference current varies, then the 
signal amplifier current and hence the output level of 
the amplifier will vary in sympathy. The maximum 
output level is limited by the need for there to be 
enough input signal to the amplifier to maintain the 
amplifier in a state of saturation. In order that the invention may be better 
understood, an embodiment thereof will now be 
described by way of example only and with reference to 
the accompanying drawing which is a circuit diagram 
showing at (A) a representative R.F. power amplifier 
being controlled and at (B) an embodiment of a control 
circuit for
