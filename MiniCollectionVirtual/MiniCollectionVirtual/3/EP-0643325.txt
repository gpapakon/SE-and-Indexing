<ABSTRACT>
The invention describes silver halide packet 
emulsion grains or crystals (11) that are 

conventionally precipitated using peptizing gelatin 
(12) of a given isoelectric pH, surrounded by a layer 

of gelatin-grafted-polymer particles (16) wherein the 
grafted gelatin (12) has a different isoelectric pH 

than the peptizing gelatin (12). The gelatin-grafted-polymer 
particles (16) are optionally chemically bonded 

to the gelatin (12) surrounding the silver halide 
grains (11). Such packet emulsions can form the basis 

for a mixed-packet color photographic system.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a photosensitive
silver halide emulsion composition, a method of
preparing said composition and to a mixed packet
photosensitive photographic element.Photographic emulsions typically comprise
silver halide particles dispersed in an aqueous medium.
Traditionally, various types of gelatin have been used
as a peptizer for the precipitation of photographic
silver halide emulsions. This results in a layer of
adsorbed gelatin surrounding each silver halide grain.
The hydrated thickness of the gelatin layer may vary
anywhere from 10 to 60 nm. Silver halide particles
comprising silver halide grains each surrounded by a
layer of peptizing gelatin are referred to herein as
"silver halide-gelatin particles".Our copending European patent application
EP-A-606 077 describes the precipitation of Ag-halide
emulsions in the presence of gelatin-grafted-polymer
particles comprising a photographically useful
compound. By the method disclosed in this copending
application one obtains polymer particles directly
attached to the Ag-halide microcrystals. As elucidated
therein, there are many advantages associated with
having such polymer particles attached to silver halide
grains in emulsion systems, including the preparation
of mixed packet photographic systems. However, the
method described in this patent application requires
modification of known emulsion preparation processes to
optimize the process for use with the gelatin-grafted-polymer
particles.There is a need to improve delivery of
photographically useful compounds to silver halide 
particles in a photographic emulsion without having to
modify and/or optimize conventional emulsion forming
processes. In particular, there is a need to improve
delivery of photographically useful compounds to
specifically sensitized silver halide particles
specific to the spectral sensitivity of the silver
halide particles in order to form mixed-packet color
photographic systems.We have discovered that the advantages of
associating gelatin-grafted-polymer particles with
silver halide particles as set forth in our above-mentioned
copending application can be achieved with
preformed, pre-precipitated, conventional silver halide
emulsions. This permits the use of silver halide
emulsions prepared by conventional manufacturing
techniques well known and/or optimized for a particular
photographic element.One aspect of this invention comprises a
photosensitive silver halide emulsion composition
comprising in an aqueous medium:
(a) silver halide-gelatin particles
