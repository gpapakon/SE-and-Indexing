<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a valve with a housing (1) enclosing several components which govern the operation of the valve, such as the obturator element (9) and valve seat (13). Located on the outside surface of the valve housing are sealing surfaces which fit against the holder (2) which accommodates the valve housing (1). A form-locking fastener locks the valve housing (1) in the holder (2). Dependently of the relative movement of the valve housing (1st part) (1) with respect to the holder (2nd part) (2), the material round the outside surface of one part (2) is forced by plastic deformation into a recess (3) in the surface of the other part (1).

<CLAIMS>
A valve, in particular a solenoid valve, with a valve
housing (1) which has valve components, such as a valve

closure member (9), a valve seat (13), determining the
function of the valve, with sealing surfaces provided on

the circumference of the valve housing (1) which correspond
with a valve accommodating body (2) carrying the valve

housing (1), with a fastening means arresting the valve
housing (1) in the valve accommodating body (2),
characterized
 in that, due to a relative
motion of the valve housing (1) with respect to the valve

accommodating body (2), the material volume existing on the
circumference of the valve accommodating body (2) is

plastically displaced into a recess (3) on the
circumference of the valve housing (1).
A valve as claimed in claim 1,
characterized
 in that the material hardness
of the material of the valve accommodating body (2) is less

than that of the valve housing (1).
A valve as claimed in claim 1 or in claim 2,
characterized
 in that the perimeter of the
valve housing (1) is provided with recesses (3) designed as

annular grooves into which the material of the valve
accommodating body (2) is displaced generally in proportion

with the stroke motion of the two parts (1, 2) which are
displaceable relative to each other.
A valve as claimed at least in one of the preceding claims
1 through 3,
characterized
 in that the valve housing (1)
is designed as a caulking stamp. 
A valve as claimed at least in one of the preceding claims,

characterized
 in that the volume capacity of
the recess (3) is equal to, or smaller than, a caulking

spot (4) formed out of the displaceable volume.
A valve as claimed in claim 5,
characterized
 in that the surface area of the
valve housing (1) near the caulking spot (4) at least has

one surrounding projection (5), in particular a knife edge,
which can be brought to mesh in an essentially frictional

manner with the bore of the valve accommodating body (2).
A valve as claimed in claim 6,
characterized
 in that several projections (5,
5', 5") with a height (h, h', h"), which increases contrary

to the jointing direction, and with a design which
generally has a saw-tooth shape are arranged in succession

near the caulking spot (4).
A valve as claimed in claim 7,
characterized
 in that the tooth bevel (6)
points in the jointing direction into the bore of the valve

accommodating body (2).
A valve as claimed at least in one of the preceding claims,

characterized
 in that the material which - by
means of a caulking action - is displaceable into the

recess (3) of the valve housing (1) is formed by the
relatively softer, plastically deformable material of a

bore step (7) of the valve accommodating body (2).
A valve as claimed in any one of claims 1 through 9,
characterized
 in that, on both sides of the
pressure medium passage bore (12) which is transverse to 

the axis of rotation of the valve housing (1), one caulking
spot (4) each is provided which can bring the valve housing

(1) in positive engagement with the valve accommodating
body (2).
A process for manufacturing a valve, in particular a
solenoid valve, with a valve housing (1) which has valve

components, such as a valve closure member (9), a valve
seat (13), determining the function of the valve, with

sealing surfaces provided on the circumference of the valve
housing (1) which correspond with a valve accommodating

body (2) carrying the valve housing (1), with a fastening
means arresting the valve housing (1) in the valve

accommodating body (2), in particular as claimed in any one
of the preceding claims 1 through 10,
characterized
 in that the individual valve
components such as valve closure member (9) and valve seat

(13) are pre-assembled in the valve housing (1), in that
the pre-assembled valve housing (1) is continuously pressed

into the valve accommodating body (2) with a defined axial
force, in that the plastic displacement of the material

volume of the valve accommodating body (2), which enters a
recess (3) of the valve housing (1) during the pressing-in

operation, takes place approximately in proportion to the
force of assembly.
A process for manufacturing a valve as claimed in claim 11,
characterized
 in that the material volume of
the valve accommodating body (2), which at the maximum is

displaced into the recess (3) of the valve housing (1)
during the pressing-in operation, corresponds to the

permissible force of assembly.
