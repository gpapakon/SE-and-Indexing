<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for manufacturing chip cards having electronic modules. The prior art has disclosed various manufacturing methods for such chip cards, in which the electronic module used in each case has a specific construction. In contrast to this, a method for manufacturing chip cards having electronic modules is now presented in which a standardised electronic module is used which, in a last method step, is adapted to the manufacturing technology of the card and is connected to the card body in accordance with the technology selected.

A method for producing data carriers having electronic modules, the electronic
modules being produced separately and having an integrated circuit and contact

surfaces electrically connected with the integrated circuit, characterized by the
following steps:


performing a sequence of method steps to produce a band containing
completely neutral electronic modules to be connected with a card body by different

techniques,
performing a sequence of adapting steps specifying the neutral electronic
module for a certain technique for connection with a card body, the sequence

including at least one step for detaching the module from the band in a way coordinated
with the selected connecting technique, thereby giving the module an

external form coordinated with the selected connecting technique, and
connecting the adapted electronic module with the card body by the selected
connecting technique.
A method for producing data carriers according to claim 1, characterized in that
the series of method steps in which the band is produced includes at least the

following steps:

preparing a metal band from which the contact surfaces are stamped such
that they initially remain connected with the metal band by bars,
disposing an integrated circuit on a group of contact surfaces required for
an electronic module and electrically connecting the contact surfaces with the

integrated circuit,

and the method step for detaching the module from the band in a way coordinated
with the selected connecting technique consists in
severing the bars connecting the module with the band, and for at least
one incorporation technique stamping the module out of the band along the

contact surfaces, and for at least one further incorporation technique stamping
the module out along an area protruding beyond the contact surfaces..
A method for producing data carriers according to claims 1 to 2, characterized
in that when the module is stamped out of the band along the contact surfaces

the module is glued into the recess in a prepared card body, and when the
module is stamped out along an area protruding beyond the contact surfaces the

module is molded with a plastic compound to form a card, or the module is incorporated
in a multilayer structure that is laminated into a card together with

the module.
A method for producing data carriers according to claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that when the module is glued into the recess in a prepared card body this is

done using a contact adhesive or thermally activated adhesive already located
on the electronic module.
A method for producing data carriers according to claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that when the module is glued into the recess in a prepared card body this is

done using a liquid adhesive that connects the contact surfaces directly with the
card body.
A method for producing data carriers according to claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the area protruding beyond the contact surfaces consists of prolongations

of the contact surfaces and is crimped in the direction of the integrated
circuit to anchor the electronic module within the card during molding with a

plastic compound.
A method for producing data carriers according to claims 1 to 3, characterized
in that the area protruding beyond the contact surfaces is formed by a separate

layer on which the contact surfaces lie.
A method for producing data carriers according to claims 5 to 6, characterized
in that the area protruding beyond the contact surfaces is provided with windows

which are penetrated by the card material when the electronic module is
anchored in the card.
