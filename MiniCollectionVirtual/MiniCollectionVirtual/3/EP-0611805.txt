<ABSTRACT>
A polyamide resin composition comprising 100 parts 
by weight of a resin composition comprised of 20 to 80% 

by weight of an aromatic polyamide resin and 80 to 20% by 
weight of a modified polyphenylene ether resin (the total 

amount in% by weight of the aromatic polyamide resin and 
the modified polyphenylene ether resin being 100% by 

weight) and, incorporated in the resin composition, 0.5 
to 30 parts by weight of a liquid-crystalline polymer, 

0.01 to 3 parts by weight of a compatibilizing agent and 
2 to 40 parts by weight of an inorganic filler and 

optionally a rubber component. The plate thickness of 
the resin molded articles may be reduced to 2 mm or less, 

and even further to 1 mm or less without deterioration of 
the properties thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a housing for
electronic equipment made of a polyamide resin
composition. More particularly, but not exclusively,
the present invention is concerned with a light-weight
housing for electronic equipment, such as personal
computers and word processors, produced by moulding a
polyamide resin composition which comprises an aromatic
polyamide resin, a modified polyphenylene ether resin,
a liquid-crystalline polymer, a compatibilizing agent
and, as an inorganic filler, a carbon fibre, mica,
glass flake, and which has excellent water
resistance, chemical resistance, mechanical properties,
fluidity during moulding and rigidity, and is less
liable to cause warpage.At the present time, there is an ever-increasing
demand for the size and weight of electronic equipment,
such as domestic electric appliances, telephones and OA
equipment, to be reduced and the use of plastics for
the housings of this equipment has been studied in the
art.In particular, note book size personal computers
and word processors among the above-described types of
portable OA equipment are required to have a reduced
size and weight due to an increase in the range of use
thereof.This has caused the material used in such portable
equipment to change from metals to plastics.However, the plastics currently used in the art
cannot attain a satisfactory weight reduction and
therefore a further reduction in weight is desired.ABS resins, AS resins, polycarbonate resins,
modified polyphenylene ether resins, etc., have
hitherto been studied as plastics for use in such a
housing and have good mouldability, a low cost and a
good appearance in the finished article. However, they 
do not provide satisfactory rigidity and therefore no
housing suitable for practical use has been provided.Further, in a housing for portable electronic
equipment, the plate thickness should be as small as
possible, and a housing having a plate thickness of 3
to 5 mm and about 2 mm for a thin plate has been put to
practical use.The reduction in plate thickness to 2 mm or less
leads to the following problems.Since the conventional resins, such as ABS resin,
have a low rigidity, if they are moulded into articles
having a small plate thickness, the moulded articles
become greatly deformed when exposed to a small
external force. Thus they cannot protect the contents
of the housing, such as liquid crystal display panels,
printed circuit boards and keyboards.When a housing having a small thickness and a
large area is moulded, the resin is rapidly cooled
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A housing for electronic equipment having an
average plate thickness of 2 mm or less and comprising

a molded product of a polyamide resin composition which
comprises:


(a) 100 parts by weight of a resin composition
comprised of 20 to 80% by weight of an m-xylylene

group-containing
polyamide resin and 80 to 20% by weight of a

modified polyphenylene ether resin obtainable by reacting
a polyphenylene ether resin with an unsaturated

aliphatic carboxylic acid or its acid anhydride, the
total amount in wt% of the aromatic polyamide resin and

the modified polyphenylene ether resin being 100 wt%;
(b) 0.5 to 30 parts by weight of a liquid
crystalline copolyester polymer having a melting point

of 200 to 300°C;
(c) 0.01 to 3 parts by weight of
phenylenebisoxazoline; and
(d) 2 to 40 parts by weight of carbon fibre and
mica or glass flake.
A housing as claimed in claim 1, wherein the
m-xylylene group-containing polyamide resin is a

product of a polycondensation of m-xylylenediamine with
adipic acid.
A housing as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2,
wherein the polyamide resin composition further

comprises up to 10 parts by weight, based on 100
parts by weight of the polyamide resin composition, of

a rubber component.
A housing as claimed in any preceding claim,
wherein the resin composition has a fluidity of 120 mm

or more in terms of bar flow length (as measured at a
resin temperature of 270°C and an injection pressure of

1600 kgf/cm
2
) using a cavity having a depth of 1 mm and
a width of 10 mm, and wherein the housing has an

elastic modulus in flexure of 100,000 kgf/cm
2
 or more
and a specific gravity of 1.35 or less.
