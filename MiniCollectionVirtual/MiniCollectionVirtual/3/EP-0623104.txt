<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a process for obtaining a pure enantiomer of 
2-(4-isobutylphenyl)-propionic acid (ibuprofen) from a mixture of enantiomers, either 
racemic or enriched with the desired enantiomer. Asymmetric synthesis and the resolution of racemates constitute the methods 
for industrial preparation of pure enantiomers. Methods for such resolution include: 
direct preferential crystallization, crystallization of the diastereomeric salts, and 
kinetic resolution. Also referred to as resolution by entrainment, preferential crystallization 
is economically more attractive because resolution is achieved without using any 
expensive optically active substance. Hence, this method is widely used on an 
industrial scale, for example, in the manufacture of Î±-methyl-L-dopa and 
chloramphenicol. See Enantiomers, Racemates, and Resolutions. Jacques, J.; Collet, 
A.; Wilen, S.H., J. Wiley & Sons, New York, 1981; Jacques, J.; Leclercq, M.; 
Brienne, M.J., Tetrahedron, 1981, 37, 1727-1733; and U.S. Patent No. 4,865,770. 
It is technically feasible only with racemates which are so-called conglomerates 
and consist of mechanical mixtures of crystals of the two enantiomers. 
Unfortunately, only less than 20% of all racemates are conglomerates. The rest 
are true racemic compounds which cannot be separated by preferential crystallization 
(i.e., by seeding a supersaturated solution of racemic mixture with the crystals 
of one enantiomer). A conglomerate exhibits a minimum melting point for the 
racemic mixture while a racemic compound generally shows a maximum melting 
point. The success of preferential crystallization depends on the fact that the 
solubility of pure enantiomer is less than the solubility of the racemic mixture. Ibuprofen is a racemic compound and hence cannot be resolved by preferential 
crystallization. Suprisingly, it has been found, and it is the object of the present  
 
invention, that achiral and racemic amine salts of racemic ibuprofen can be resolved 
with no use of optically active substances by means of direct crystallization method. Enantiomers of conglomerates can be resolved by direct crystallization. 
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to prepare salts of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic 
acid that are conglomerates. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for 
separation of the enantiomers of conglomerate salts of 2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic 
acid. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for 
obtaining a
