<ABSTRACT>
A facsimile section receives and decodes data transmitted 
through a communication line, converts the received data into 

dot image data line by line, and further performs resolution 
conversion of the data by means of a resolution converter. 

The data subjected to the resolution conversion is transferred 
to a printer section through a Centronics interface. When 

data of an entire line is all white, a white-skip command is 
transferred for that line. The printer section performs 

horizontal/vertical conversion of the transferred dot image 
data and data corresponding to the transferred white-skip 

command by means of a horizontal/-vertical converter, the 
converted data being stored in a scan buffer. When the scan 

buffer is full of the data for one scan, a recording head is 
driven to record an image. In an image communicating 

apparatus comprising the facsimile section and the printer 
section, the load of the control unit of the facsimile section 

can be diminished, and the time required for the recording can 
be reduced, with the above arrangement.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image communicating
apparatus for recording an image on a recording material in
accordance with received image data.Hitherto, serial printers, e.g., ink jet printers, for
recording image data output from host computers or the like
have been known. This type of printer is connected to a host
computer through a universal interface such as a Centronics
interface. Image data corresponding to one main scan of a
recording head is transferred from the host computer to the
printer, which stores the data in its buffer and then performs
recording. Each time one main scan is completed, a sheet of
paper is advanced (sub-scan) by an amount corresponding to the
recording width of the recording head. By repeating the main
scan and the sub-scan a sufficient times, an image of one page
is recorded.Recently, a facsimile equipment using the aforementioned
serial printer as a recording unit has been proposed. In this
type facsimile equipment, as with the above combination of a 
host computer and a printer, a facsimile section for
controlling transmission/reception of image data is connected
to a printer section through a universal interface such as a
Centronics interface for transferring the received image data
to the printer section.In facsimile equipment, image data is usually handled on
a line-by-line basis. To record the received image data by a
serial printer, therefore, the received image data must be
transformed (horizontal/vertical conversion) into data
in accordance with an array of recording elements of a
recording head mounted on the printer.When the received image data has a resolution different
from that used in recording by the printer, it is also
required to convert the resolution of the image data.If both horizontal/vertical conversion and resolution
conversion are carried out in the facsimile section, the load
of a CPU in the facsimile section will be so increased as to
cause an overload state when transmitting or receiving another
image while data is being transferred to the printer section.Also, the transfer of data from the facsimile section to
the printer section takes substantial time because the data is
transferred as live data for all lines through a Centronics
interface.It is known from EP-A-0294622 to provide apparatus
in which resolution conversion is performed when an image
is scaled and in which the main and subscan directions 
can be changed when printing, these processes being
controlled by a main controller.According to the present invention there is
