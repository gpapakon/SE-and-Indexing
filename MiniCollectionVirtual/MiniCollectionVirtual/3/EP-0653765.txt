<ABSTRACT>
This transformer, with a sealed tank filled with a dielectric cooling liquid, is provided with equipment for self protection against the risk of explosion of the tank, consisting of:   * an immersed unit for protection against internal breakdowns degenerating relatively slowly and comprising:   - an immersed sensor 1, sensitive to changes of a characteristic of the dielectric liquid which surrounds it, chosen from among those, such as pressure, which react at the site of the sensor practically upon the appearance, at any site in the liquid mass, of a degenerative defect, this sensor delivering an "on or off" signal in response to this alteration. - a non-rearmable polyphase contact breaker 5 between the phases of the power supply and the corresponding primary winding of the transformer. - and a trigger 6 for control of the opening of the contact breaker 5 driven by the signal delivered by the sensor 1, when the amplitude of the said signal exceeds a preestablished safety threshold value: * and a unit for protection against sudden current overloads drawn by the transformer from the power supply means, comprising, on each of the phases of the power supply, an array of fuses 26, 27 mounted in cascade and including staged cutoff thresholds.

Immersed polyphase electrical transformer
placed in a sealed tank filled with a dielectric liquid

and provided with a piece of equipment for self-protection
against the risks of the tank exploding by

disconnection from the electrical supply mains,
characterized in that the said piece of equipment

consists of:

on the one hand, a protection unit which reacts to
internal defects having a slow rate of

degeneration and which is immersed in the
dielectric liquid within the tank and comprises:


a sensor (1) which is sensitive to the variations
in a characteristic of the said dielectric liquid

chosen from those such as the pressure, the
measurement of which at any point is

representative of the appearance of a local defect
anywhere else within the tank, the said sensor

delivering a signal in response to these
variations;
a non-resettable polyphase contact breaker (5)
between the phases (u, v, w) of the electrical

supply and the corresponding primary windings of
the transformer; and
a trip (6) for causing the breaker (5) to open,
supplied with the signal delivered by the sensor

(1), when the amplitude of the said signal exceeds
a pre-established safety threshold value;
and, on the other hand, a unit for protection
against current overloads called on the supply

mains by the transformer and comprising at least
one fuse (27) on each of the phases (u, v, w) of

the supply.
Transformer according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the said unit for protection against current

overloads consists, on each of the phases of the
electrical supply, of a bank of at least two fuses (26,

27) which have staged cutoff thresholds and are
connected in series.
Transformer according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the said unit for protection

against current overloads is also immersed in the
dielectric liquid within the tank.
Transformer according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the sensor (1) is of the mechanical type and

delivers a signal in the form of a force applied to the
trip (6) in order to activate the latter when the said

safety threshold is exceeded.
Transformer according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the breaker (5) consists of:


two electrical connection supports (7, 9) made of
electrically insulati
ng material, one support (9)
carrying the terminals (10, 10', 10") for input of

the current into the windings of the primary of
the transformer and the other support (7) carrying

the corresponding output terminals (8, 8', 8") for
the phases of the electrical supply, the said

input and output terminals being arranged opposite
each other on their respective support and in

contact with each other in order to provide the
electrical connection for the transformer in the

closed position of the breaker, one (9) of the
supports being fixed and the other (7) being

mounted so as to move in rotation about its axis
between a closed position and an open position of

the breaker; 
resilient counteracting means (11) tending
permanently to place the breaker (5) in the open

position, mutually moving the output terminals
(8...) away from the input terminals (10...) by

rotation of the movable support (7); and
a device (13) for rotationally locking the movable
support (7), ensuring that the breaker (5) is kept

in the closed position by being engaged in the
trip (2).
Transformer according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the terminals (8) on the movable support (7)

are located on supporting bases (29) which move them
away from the axis of rotation of the support.
Transformer according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the said movable support (7) is mounted so as

to rotate in bearings (23) which also keep the fixed
support (9) in position, the said bearings being

carried by a base (12) which is fastened to a baseplate
(24), carries the trip (6) and presents the resilient

counteracting means (11) with a bearing surface (28).
Transformer according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the trip (6) is formed from a movable element

(15), stressed by the sensor (1), and from a pivoting
trigger (16) with a return spring (20), one end (22) of

which interacts with the device (13) for rotationally
locking the movable support (7), in order to keep the

breaker (5) in the closed position, and the other end
(21) of which interacts with the said movable element

(15).
Transformer according to Claim 1 or 2,
characterized in that the said unit for protection

against current overloads is mounted upstream of the
protection unit sensitive to the characteristics of the

dielectric liquid with respect to the electrical
supply.
Transformer according to Claim 5, characterized
in that the breaker comprises switching means allowing

the points for input of the current into the windings
of the primary to be simultaneously adapted to the 

value of the voltage applied by the electrical mains to
each phase of the supply.
