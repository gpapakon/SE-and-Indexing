<ABSTRACT>
Process for manufacturing an electrical connection device, and the connection device thus obtained, this being for connecting a plastic strip (1) having a conductive coating on only one face (5) to a second conductor (15) positioned on the non-conductive side (3) of the said strip, consisting in shaping the terminal blade (7) constituted by the terminal part of the said strip into a loop by thermoforming between two parallel rolls, at least one of which is heated, these rolls being rotationally driven in order to press the non-conductive face of the terminal blade (7) against a non-conductive portion of the strip. Application of the connection device thus obtained for the electrical supply of disposable devices.

<CLAIMS>
Method of manufacturing an electrical connection
between a thin strip in a plastic material (1) having a

conductive coating on a single face (5) and a second
conductor (15) positioned on the non-conductive side (3)

of said strip, characterised in that the plastic material
used is able to be thermoformed and in that a lug (7)

formed by the end portion of the strip is rolled up by
being folded between two parallel cylinders (10, 11)

positioned respectively on the conductive face (5) and the
non-conductive face (3), at least one cylinder being

heated, and the two cylinders being driven in rotation
until the cylinder (11) pressing upon the conductive face

(5) comes to press the non-conductive face (3) of lug (7)
onto a non-conductive portion of the strip (1).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the cylinder (11) which is applied onto the

conductive face of the strip has a diameter less than that
of the cylinder (10) applied onto the non-conductive face

of the strip.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the rolling up of the lug (7) is achieved by keeping

the cylinder (10) positioned on the non-conductive face
(3) and by rolling the other cylinder (11) on the

conductive face (5).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that the rolling up of the lug (7) is achieved by keeping

the two cylinders (10, 11) fixed in relation to each other
and by rolling on the non-conductive face (3) of the strip

the cylinder (10) positioned on said face by driving the
other cylinder (11).
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that a small quantity of adhesive is also added between

the non-conductive surfaces facing the lug (7) and the
strip (1). 
Method according to claim 1, characterised in
that only the cylinder (10) positioned on the non-conductive

face (3) is heated.
Electrical connection between a thin plastic
strip (1) having a conductive coating on a single face (5)

and a second conductor (15) positioned on the non-conductive
side of said strip (1), characterised in that a

lug (7) formed by the end portion of the strip (1) is
formed in a loop by thermoforming, so that the non-conductive

face of the end of said lug comes to press
against a non-conductive portion of the strip (1).
