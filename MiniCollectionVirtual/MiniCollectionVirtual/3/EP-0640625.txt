<ABSTRACT>
A catalyst and method for producing olefin polymers 
having high MFR and reduced die swell for use in blow molding 

applications is provided. The polymers are produced by fluidized bed 
polymerization of ethylene and optionally one or more alpha olefins at 

elevated temperatures in the presence of a spherical or microspherical, 
supported chromium-titanium catalyst having a refractory oxide 

support material that has at least 70% of its pore volume in the pore 
size range of about 200 to 500 Angstroms, which supported catalyst 

has been activated at a temperature ranging from about 850°C to the 
sintering temperature of the supported catalyst.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a chromium-titanium 
compound-containing catalyst for polymerizing ethylene and optionally one 
or more alpha-olefins, also known as a 1-olefins, to a method for producing 
such a catalyst, and to a method of polymerizing ethylene and optionally 
such alpha-olefins. More particularly, the invention is directed to a method 
of producing polymers of ethylene or copolymers of ethylene and one or more 
alpha-olefins at higher temperatures than was heretofore possible, which 
polymers are useful in the fabrication of blow molding products. Fabricators of blow molding products such as household and 
industrial containers (i.e., plastic food bottles for milk, juice, and water; 
chemical bottles for detergent and motor oil; and heavy-duty storage drums) 
set performance and appearance standards for their products. These 
fabricators also require that the blow molding products be formed by 
existing commercial equipment and blow molding processing techniques 
with no or minimal equipment modifications or lengthening of the work 
cycle necessary to fabricate a blow molding product. Polymers for use in blow molding products, accordingly, are 
provided within these constraints established by the fabricators of blow 
molding products. Acceptable polymers for blow molding generally must 
exhibit good melt strength, no melt fracture, and die swell within the 
constraints of customer's equipment. Polymers having a relatively broad 
molecular weight distribution (MWD), as evidenced by relatively high 
values of melt flow ratio (MFR) usually exhibit one or more of these 
properties. In general, MFR values can range in value from 60 to 130. 
Since MFR is the measurement of flow index of the polymer divided by the 
melt index of the polymer, ranges in value of MFR differ depending on  
 
whether the polymer is a homopolymer or copolymer, the flow index value, 
and type of blow molding product (milk bottle, detergent bottle, drum, etc.). 
Accordingly, typical MFR values for blow molding products are as follows: 
Meeting die swell requirements when producing a blow 
molding product is also critical. If the swell is too high, the bottle cannot be 
trimmed using existing commercial equipment. If the die swell is too low, 
side handles are not formed. Unfortunately, the chromium (or "chrome") 
catalyzed polymers used to produce blow molded articles often exhibit or 
possess high swell properties and require post-polymerization processing to 
meet commercial swell requirements. The term die
