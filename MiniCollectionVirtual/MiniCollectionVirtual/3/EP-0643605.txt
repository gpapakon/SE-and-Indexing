<ABSTRACT>
The device for a table game according to the present invention consists of a plurality of transparent planes (1), linked one to the other, on which a plurality of sheafs of parallel lines (3) are placed crossing vertically, and along which lines a plurality of series of "men" having different structures are moved in diagonal sense, whereby said "men" move, on the three planes, according to their typology.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention concerns a device consisting of means 
for realizing a table game comprising multiple chess-boards 
superimposed one upon the other and 'men' to be spatially 
moved.  
 US patent No. 4,883,278 is known to the art, describing a 
device for a table game comprising an upper, a central and a 
lower square chess-board made of transparent material 
whereby the boards are vertically arranged at right angles 
to each other, for the realization of a plurality of square 
boxes that contain, in turn, the moving pieces.  
 The device according to the present invention consists mainly 
in a plurality of transparent planes superimposed one upon 
the other and linked one to the other, onto which a plurality 
of sheafs of parallel lines are provided, crossing 
orthogonally, and along which three series of 'men', with 
different structures, are moved in diagonal sense; said 'men' 
also move in said three planes, according to their typology, 
respectively in diagonal, in reflected semi-diagonal or in 
vertical sense. The device according to the present invention will be 
described hereinbelow relating to the enclosed drawings, in 
which a preferred embodiment is shown.  
 
Figure 1shows an axonometric view of a variant with three 
planes of the device according to the present 
invention. Figure 2shows a lateral view of three possible structural 
typologies of the 'men' having different shapes. Figure 3shows one of the planes composing the complete 
device, with the pool position of the 'men'. Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9show six possible game 
conditions: 
figure 4: in diagonal sense with two 'men' A and 
one opponent on the three planes (catching of the 
black 'man'); figure 5: in diagonal sense with two 'men' A and 
one opponent C (catching of the white 'man'); figure 6: in semidiagonal reflected sense with two 
'men' B and one opponent on the two planes 
(catching of the black 'man'); figure 7: in semidiagonal reflected sense with two 
'men' B and one opponent on two planes (catching 
of the black 'man'); figure 8: in perpendicular sense with two 'men' C 
and one opponent on three planes (catching of the 
black 'man');  
 figure 9: in vertical sense with two 'men' C and 
one opponent (catching of the black 'man'). Relating now to the details of the enclosed figures, the  
 
device for a table game with multiple chess-boards, 
superimposed one upon the other, and spatial movements, 
comprising pieces A, B, C, different according to the 
possibilities of movement on the planes consisting of: 
three
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A device for a table game with multiple chess-boards, 
superimposed one upon the other, and 

spatial movements, comprising pieces A, B,C, 
different according to the possibilities of 

movement on the planes, characterized in: 

three superimposed octogonal planes (1), 
supported by a central pin, realized out of 

transparent plastic material, for the 
identification of the position of the 'men' (A, 

B, C) placed on said planes, by the players 
observing from above; 
a plurality of parallel lines (3), realized by 
engraving, printing or other, on said 

transparent planes (1), not used for forming 
squares for deviding said planes, but for 

showing the directions, crossing at right 
angles, for the moves of pieces (A, B, C,) that 

can be found by the players due to the 
transparency of said planes.
