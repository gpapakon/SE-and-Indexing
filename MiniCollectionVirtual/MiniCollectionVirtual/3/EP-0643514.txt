<ABSTRACT>
Access control for a packet communications network includes a 
dynamic bandwidth updating mechanism which continuously monitors the mean 

bit rate of the signal source and the loss probability of the connection. These 

values are filtered to remove noise and then used to test whether the values fall 
within a pre-defined acceptable adaptation region in the mean bit rate, loss 

probability plane. Values falling outside of this region trigger bandwidth 
updating procedures which, in turn, result in acquiring a new connection 

bandwidth, and determining new filter parameters and new parameters for a 
leaky bucket access mechanism.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to traffic management in packet
communications networks and, more particularly, to traffic monitoring, traffic
measurement filtering, and adaptive bandwidth adjustment for such networks.In order to avoid congestion and insure adequate traffic flow in
packet communication networks, it is common to control the access of packet
sources to the network on an ongoing basis. In order to successfully control
traffic access, it is necessary, first, to accurately characterize the traffic so as to
provide appropriate bandwidth for carrying that traffic. Simple measurements
which provide accurate estimates of the bandwidth requirements of a source are
taught in the copending application US-A-5 274 625, filed September
10, 1992, and assigned to applicants' assignee. In this application, the
parameters used to characterize traffic include R, the peak bit rate of the
incoming traffic in bits per second, m, the mean bit rate of the incoming traffic
in bits per second, and b, the mean burst length of the traffic in bits. Rather
than using the actual burst length, however, a so-called "exponential substitution"
technique is used to calculate and equivalent burst length which would produce
the same packet loss probability if the traffic were a well behaved exponentially
distributed on/off process. For traffic widely differing from such an exponential
process, this equivalent burst length produces a much more accurate
characterization of the actual traffic and therefore permits a higher density of
traffic on the same transmission facilities.The measured parameters are used to control the access of signal
sources to the network when the actual traffic behavior departs significantly from
the initial assumptions. A leaky bucket mechanism is one technique for
controlling access to the network when the traffic exceeds the initial assumptions,
but yet permits transparent access to the network when the traffic remains within
these initial assumptions. One such leaky bucket mechanism is shown in the
copending application US-A-5 311 513, filed September 10, 1992, and
assigned to applicant's assignee. More particularly, the leaky bucket mechanism 
of this application prevents saturation of the network by low priority packets by
limiting the number of low priority packets which can be transmitted in a fixed
period of time while imposing a minimum on the number of red packets
transmitted at a given time. Such leaky bucket control mechanisms optimize the
low priority throughput of the packet network. High
