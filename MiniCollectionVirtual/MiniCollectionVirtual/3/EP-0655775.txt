<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a dry etching process for etching silicon 
compounds and in particular to a process which has applicability for making high 
aspect ratio holes and openings in SiOx compounds or glass and in particular to 
a process which is highly selective between the etch rate of SiOx and metal 
salicides (MSix), in particular TiSix. The subject matter is related to that in our copending application 
93306236.6 (0596593), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by 
reference. In application 93306236.6 (0596593) it is pointed out that there is a need 
for improved and rapid silicon compound etch processes for integrated circuit 
manufacture and for glass product manufacture. One of the most important 
measures of a good etch process is its ability to make clean walled, high aspect 
ratio holes. Another important parameter for integrated circuit etch processes is 
high selectivity for the silicon oxide compounds as opposed to masking, or etch 
stop materials. As explained in detail in the above mentioned application, in modern 
integrated circuit manufacture, because of the need for multiple metal 
interconnect layers, and due to the planarization requirements, the distance  
 
from the planarized top surface of an integrated circuit to the underlying low 
resistance interconnection contacting surfaces across a single chip can now 
vary widely, i.e., from 5000Å to 20000Å. The etch process for VIAS or 
openings to reach underlying metal must therefore be able to make the 
deeper holes while at the same time not damaging the materials at the 
bottom of the shallow holes. To accomplish this result, the etch process 
must be highly selective so that it does not substantially etch the material in 
the bottom of the VIA holes while at the same time continuing to rapidly etch 
the silicon compound of the deeper holes. In addition, the process must 
make clean side walls of such openings and VIA holes without forming or 
depositing significant amounts of debris i.e. polymers, on the wall or at the 
bottom of the openings or holes. In the parent case, a novel process was 
disclosed for making high aspect ratio VIA holes which is highly selective to 
TiN and which leaves essentially no polymer in the VIAS. The process 
disclosed in the parent application employs a high flow rate of a low mass 
atoms at high elevated pressure (10.0Torr>p>0.8 Torr) to increase inelastic 
collision in order to effectively cool the plasma generated by the excitation of 
CHF₃ and nitrogen glasses using 400 KHz
