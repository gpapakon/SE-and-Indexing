<ABSTRACT>
A flat image display including a layer of energy 
conversion material (111) for converting electron energy to 

photon energy. An electron emitter (105) disposed relative 

to the layer of energy conversion material such that an 
intervening region (103, 142) is defined between the energy 

conversion material (111) and the electron emitter (105). An 
enclosing backplane (106) is distally disposed with respect 

to the electron emitter (105) and in a direction generally 
opposite to the energy conversion means (111) so as to 

define a plenum (120) between the backplane (106) and the 
electron emitter (105). A getter layer (109) is disposed in 

the plenum (120) to mitigate the influence of ionic and 
molecular contaminants which otherwise would impinge on the 

electron emitter.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to flat display 
devices and more particularly to flat emissive displays 
employing diamond material electron emitters Flat displays are known in the art and may be realized 
by one of many techniques such as by employing, for example, 
liquid crystal, plasma, electroluminescent, and field 
emission technology. All of these known techniques suffer 
from a number of inherent limitations which make them 
unsuitable for many applications. The liquid crystal 
displays are non-emissive which restricts their use to 
environments with ambient lighting or in conjunction with an 
attendant light source. Plasma and electroluminescent 
displays, while emissive, are not readily implemented as 
full color displays and further suffer from insufficient 
light output for bright ambient applications such as in 
direct sunlight. Field emission displays provide improved operation over 
other flat displays. However, field emission displays are 
known to suffer from arc discharge damage induced through 
liberation of adsorbed and absorbed contaminants during 
display operation. Also, known flat field emission displays 
employ spacers to maintain a nominal faceplate to electron 
emitter spacing. Spacers disposed between the faceplate and 
substrate are intrusive and objectionable as they tend to 
inhibit full utilization of the faceplate area.  Further, known flat field emission displays suffer from 
a limited capability to withstand outgassing within the 
evacuated volume which is an integral part of the display. Accordingly, there exists a need for a flat field 
emission display which overcomes at least some of these 
shortcomings of the prior art. It is one purpose of the present invention to provide a 
structurally sound image display apparatus which does not 
employ discrete supporting spacers between the electron 
emitting layer and the cathodoluminescent layers. It is another purpose of the present invention to 
provide an image display apparatus comprised of an evacuated 
plenum which reduces the effects of outgassing which may 
occur within the display evacuated regions. It is yet another purpose of the present invention to 
provide a flat image display apparatus with an electrostatic 
ion trap in concert with a getter material to actively 
control the effects of residual gas contaminants which may 
be disposed within the interspace aperture, the substrate 
aperture, and plenum. This need and others, along with the above purposes and 
others, is substantially met through provision of
