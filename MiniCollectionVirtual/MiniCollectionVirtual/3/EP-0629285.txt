<ABSTRACT>
A device for measuring displacement and force comprises two masses of material linked together by a parallel beam linkage which permits displacement of one mass relative to the other in a single direction. The displacement or force input to be measured is applied to one of the masses in the allowable direction. The displacement of the masses with respect to each other is sensed by a sensor. In a preferred embodiment, the sensor comprises a Hall effect sensor attached to one of the masses positioned between two magnets attached to the other mass. Movement of one mass relative to the other changes the magnetic field around the Hall effect sensor. The change is sensed by the Hall effect sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
In many environments, accurate and precise measurements 
are required of small positional displacements of objects 
within mechanical systems. It is also often required to 
obtain measurements of force applied in a particular direction. Most mechanical devices designed to obtain these 
measurements are typically limited by the inherent 
characteristics of mechanical systems. These limitations 
include hysteresis and backlash. Also, forces and 
displacements are rarely limited in application to only a 
single direction. A force or displacement applied in 
primarily the z direction, for example, will also have 
components in both the x and y directions. In addition, x, y 
and z torsional components will also be present. If it is 
desired to obtain an accurate meausrement of the displacement 
or force in the z direction only, the effect of these 
additional components must be minimized in the measurement 
device. EP-A-456190, used for delimitation, discloses a semiconductor accelerometer 
having a response member (weight) elastically supported at its 
opposite sides by four beams. The weight moves in a direction 
perpendicular to the plane containing the four beams. Gauge 
resistors are provided on the beams to determine the degree of 
deflection of the response member. SU-A-534694 discloses an accelerometer which has two 
U-shaped slots oriented opposite each other with strain gauges 
placed between the slots in pairs. Folded beams with a low force transducer are indicated in US-A-5045827. According to a first aspect of the present invention, 
there is provided a displacement measuring apparatus 
comprising: 
a first mass of material; a second mass of material linked to the first mass of 
material by parallel beams, said parallel beams allowing 
displacement between the masses and providing return force  
 
against said displacement, the second mass being enclosed by the 
first mass and the first mass, the second mass and the parallel 
beams being a single unit formed from a single piece of material; 
and a sensor for sensing the displacement of the second mass 
relative to the first mass, characterized in that each of said beams comprises arms displaced relative to each 
other in the direction transverse to the beams and joined 
end-to-end and in that said beams allow displacement between the 
masses in the direction transverse to the beams.  Embodiments of the present invention provide a device for 
measuring displacement. The device comprises two masses of 
material linked together via two parallel
