<ABSTRACT>
A chemically protective laminate comprising a thin thermoplastic barrier layer, having a consistent thickness, laminated between two porous polymeric membrane layers. The porous polymeric membrane may be of porous polytetrafluoroethylene, preferably expanded porous polytetrafluoroethylene. The chemically protective laminate may be subsequently adhered to a backing to form a fabric laminate capable of being assembled into a chemically protective article.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a chemically protective, flexible 
laminate; and more particularly to a multi-layered laminate having 
a thin thermoplastic barrier layer and two porous polymeric 
membrane layers. In order to limit exposure of humans to toxic and/or hazardous 
chemicals, protective clothing materials have been developed which 
provide protection against exposure to these chemicals. Personnel 
required to wear garment systems fabricated from protective 
clothing materials include those workers at chemical manufacturing 
sites who risk coming in contact with toxic and/or hazardous 
chemicals in spite of engineering controls implemented to contain 
these chemicals. Personnel are also required to wear garment 
systems for protection against exposure from toxic and hazardous 
chemicals where engineering controls are not available to minimize 
their exposure to the hazardous chemical agents, such as for 
example during remediation of a hazardous waste site, or in an 
emergency situation such as a chemical spill or fire or during 
chemical warfare where military personnel may be exposed to such 
noxious chemical agents as blister agents such as Mustard gas or 
nerve agents during military operations . Contact with these toxic and/or hazardous chemicals can result 
in harm to the human body ranging from acute trauma, such as  
 
dermatitis, burns or poisoning, to chronic effects such as cancer. Toxic and/or hazardous chemicals may affect protective 
clothing materials in various ways. The toxic and/or hazardous 
chemical may degrade protective clothing materials by effecting a 
deleterious change in one or more physical properties of the 
protective clothing material upon contact with the toxic and/or 
hazardous chemical. The toxic and/or hazardous chemical may 
penetrate protective clothing materials through closures, pores or 
other imperfections in the protective clothing material. The toxic 
and/or hazardous chemical may permeate protective clothing 
materials through the chemically protective material on a molecular 
level. When the toxic and/or hazardous chemicals present a risk in 
minute quantities, chemically protective materials must limit the 
permeation of the chemical through the material for a period of 
time. Permeation rates of a particular toxic and/or hazardous 
chemical for a given chemically protective material are ordinarily 
determined on a per unit thickness basis. To predict the degree of 
protection offered by a particular chemically protective material 
against a particular

A chemically protective laminate comprising: 

(a) a layer of porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, 
(b) a thin layer of a thermoplastic barrier polymer having a thickness 
of between 51 microns and 130 microns and being on a first 

side of the layer of porous expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, said 
thin layer having a consistent thickness represented by a true 

coefficient of variation of 16,7 % or less,
