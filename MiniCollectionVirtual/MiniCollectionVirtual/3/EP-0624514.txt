<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a structure for an aircraft seat, comprising at least one element (30) forming a front foot and at least one element (31) forming a rear foot, and energy absorbing means (32, 40) which are active during the relative movement of a movable element (10) of the seat with respect to another element (20) of the seat or of the floor of the cabin of the aircraft, under the effect of a deceleration undergone by the seat beyond a predetermined value. According to the invention, the energy absorbing means (32, 40) comprise an energy absorbing device (40) including a male piece (1) penetrating forcibly with plastic deformation into a recess (2) of a female piece (3). According to the invention, one of the female (3) or male (1) pieces is attached on/and directly associated with the movable element (10); and the other male (1) or female (3) piece is attached on/and directly associated with the other element (20).

An underframe for an air transport seat 
comprising at least one member (30) forming a front foot 

and at least one member (31) forming a rear foot, and 
energy absorbing means (32, 40) active upon the relative 

movement of a mobile member (10) of the structure of the 
underframe with respect to another member (20) of the 

underframe or of the floor of the cabin of the craft, 
under the effect of a deceleration undergone by the seat 

beyond a predetermined value, characterised in that the 
energy absorbing means (32, 40) comprise an energy 

absorbing device (40) including a male piece (1) 
penetrating by force with plastic deformations into a 

recess (2) of a female piece (3), in that one of the 
female (3) or male (1) pieces is mounted on and directly 

associated with the mobile member (10), and in that the 
other male (1) or female (3) piece is mounted on and 

directly associated with the other member (20). 
An underframe according to claim 1, comprising a 
triangular base (33) defining a front anchorage (34) and 

a rear anchorage (35) at the floor of the cabin of the 
craft and a raised intermediate top (36); and at least 

one foot (31) associated at its upper end (37) with the 
structure of the seat and at its lower end (38) with the 

triangular base (33), characterised in that the mobile 
member (10) is the foot (31) and the other member (20) is 

the triangular base (33), the energy absorbing device 
(40) being mounted and directly associated between the 

foot (31) and the base (33). 
An underframe according to claim 2, 
characterised in that the foot (31) is associated at its 

lower end (38) at least in the vicinity of the raised 
intermediate top (36) of the base (33).  

 
An underframe according to claim 3, 
characterised in that the energy absorbing device (40) is 

directly associated with the foot (31) at least in the 
vicinity of the lower end (38) and is directly associated 

with the base (33) at least in the vicinity of the raised 
intermediate top (36) so that it bears a tractive stress 

in the case where the deceleration undergone by the seat 
beyond said predetermined value tends to make the foot 

(31) pivot forward with respect to the base (33). 
An underframe according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the recess (2) of the female piece 

(3) includes a flared part (4) prolonged by an oblong 
part (5) having two bearings (6) facing each other and an 

end (7) opposite to the flared part (4) and having a 
width between the bearings (6) inferior to the flared 

part (4), said flared part (4) cooperating, in the 
inactive position of the device, with the male piece (1) 

having the shape of a pin (8) with a width substantially 
greater than the width between the bearings of the oblong 

part (5), so that, in action, the device (40) absorbs the 
energy through the plastic deformation of the bearings 

(6) of the oblong part (5) of the female piece (3) 
separated by the introduction, between them, of the pin 

(8) forming the male part. 
An underframe according to claims 2 and 5, 
characterised in that the recess (2) includes an end (7) 

forming a limit stop for the male piece (1) limiting the 
amplitude of the movement of the foot (31) with respect 

to the base (33). 
An underframe according to claim 5 or 6, 
characterised in that the pin (8) comprises a threaded 

associating part (9) cooperating with a tapped hole (11) 
of the member (20) with which it is associated.  

 
An underframe according to any of claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that the oblong part (5) has a major 

axis (13) located on a plane (P) crossing the direction 
(D) of the relative movement of the female piece (3) with 

respect to the male piece (1). 
An underframe according to any of claims 5 to 8, 
characterised in that the flared part (4) is a circular 

hole (4) and the oblong part (5) is an elongated slot (5) 
traversing the female piece (3) through and through. 
An underframe according to claim 9, 
characterised in that the male piece (1) comprises an 

outer ring (12) whose outer surface will cooperate with 
the bearings (6) of the elongated slot (5) when the 

device (40) is active.
