<ABSTRACT>
A self-service system, such as an automated teller machine (ATM) 
system, uses predictive technology. When a user begins a transaction by 

inserting an identification card into a card reader of an ATM, the predictive 
technology predicts which service or services provided by the system the user is 

likely to request. This prediction is based upon a stored record in the system, 
representing previous transactions by that user. The prediction is made in 

advance of completion of an authorisation process for the transaction, to 
increase the speed of operation of the ATM in carrying out the transaction. For 

example, to reduce overall transaction time, the ATM can count out a predicted 
amount of cash in advance of an anticipated withdrawal request. Also, the 

prediction is used to generate a special display for a particular user, the display 
being designed to simplify the decisions and selections required to be made by 

the user.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a self-service business system.As the complexity and range of services made available by self-service systems such as
automated teller machines (ATMs) increase, there is a desirability that the means by which a
user interacts with these systems should be improved. Where the services provided by a self-service
system are both large in number and varied in nature, it has been necessary to break
these up into functional groups. It is known to provide a series of menu interfaces which allow
a user to navigate through these groups, allowing the user to access the actual service which
the user requires. Generally, the user must evaluate each of the options presented on a menu
and select one of them, either to proceed to a lower level menu or to request a required
service. The number of decisions and selections that a user must make increases as the range
of facilities provided increases. This increasing workload for the user is known as cognitive
load, and is likely to have an increasing impact in the future as regards the time taken to
complete transactions and as regards the willingness of a user to use the full range of facilities
offered by a self-service system.An automated teller machine is disclosed in Japanese Patent Application No. 3-168892
in
which facilitates and improves the efficiency of money transfer transactions at that ATM by
displaying to a customer who has selected a money transfer transaction option on an initial
display screen at a particular ATM, a list of the monetary facility destinations available to
the customer, in the order of their frequency of designation at that ATM. Therefore, local
monetary facility destinations which are frequently selected by customers during money
transfer transactions at a particular local ATM are more likely to appear near the top of the
list on the display.It is an object of the present invention to provide a self-service business system having
the features of simplified mode of operation and reduced transaction time.According to the invention there is provided a self-service system including:
one or more self service terminals, each including a user interface unit having user
identification means and input means operable by a user for initiating a selected self-service
transaction; andcontroller means controlling the operation of said system; characterized by storage means arranged to store data characterizing the behaviour pattern of a user
with respect to their use of the terminals included in the system in previous
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A self-service system including:

one or more self service terminals (10), each including a user interface unit (14) having
user identification means (20) and input means (16) operable by a user for initiating a selected

self-service transaction; and
controller means (12, 32) for controlling the operation of said system; characterized by
storage means (36, 30) arranged to store data characterizing the behaviour pattern of a
user with respect to their use in previous transactions of the terminals included in the system;
prediction means (38) coupled to said storage means (36), to said identification means
(20) and to said controller means (12, 32) and arranged to predict the type of transaction to be

initiated by a given user on the basis of the data stored in the storage means (36, 30) for that
user, the mode of operation of said system when performing a transaction for a particular user

being dependent on a prediction made by said prediction means (38) following identification of
that user.
A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the user identification means (20)
is formed by a card reader for reading account information relating to a user from a card.
A system according to claim 1 or claim 2, characterized in that said input means (16) is
associated with user instruction means (18) for providing to a user information concerning the

action to be taken by the user to cause a desired transaction to be carried out by said system,
the information provided by said instruction means (18) being dependent on the prediction

made by said prediction means (38).
A system according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
information contained in said storage means (36, 30) is arranged to be updated each time a

transaction is initiated by a user of the system.
A system according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized in that the
storage means includes an environmental data source (30) storing environmental data relating

to transactions. 
A system according to any one of the preceding claims, characterized by authorisation
means (12) arranged to authorise a transaction in response to the entry by a user of a personal

identification number on said input means (16), said prediction means (38) being arranged to
commence the process for making said prediction prior to the completion of an authorisation

process for authorising said transaction.
A system according to claim 6, characterized in that the self-service terminal (10)
includes cash dispensing means (22), said cash dispensing means being arranged to commence

counting of a predetermined amount of cash determined by said prediction prior to the
completion of said authorisation process.
A system according to claims 6 or 7, characterized by host computer means (12)
coupled to said prediction means (38) and arranged to hold account information relating to

users of the system, a process for accessing and transmitting account information concerning a
particular user to said self-service terminal (10) being arranged to be commenced prior to the

completion of said authorisation process.
A system according to claim 1, characterized in that the storage means (36, 30) is
located remotely from the self service terminals (10) of the system and is arranged to store data

characterizing the behaviour pattern of each user of the system with respect to their use of any
of the terminals included in the system in previous transactions.
A system according to claim 2, characterized in that the storage means (36, 30)
is located on the user's card.
