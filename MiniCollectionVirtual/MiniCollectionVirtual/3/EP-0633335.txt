<ABSTRACT>
An adjusting member (5) designed as a tube (50) with a welded-on adjusting plate (98) is seated on the oscillating arm (6) so as to be displaceable, adjustable and lockable in two directions perpendicular to one another. The oscillating arm (6) passes through the adjusting member (5) in a guide (60) transversely to its longitudinal extension. The adjusting member (5) has a rotary bearing (53) for the connecting rod (3) to the dobby mechanism, the oscillating arm (6) being enclosed by a guide plate (7), the ends of which are connected to one another via a block (80). Arranged between this block (80) and the oscillating arm (6) are bracing means (72, 95, 96, 97) which, during bracing between the block (80) and oscillating arm (6), are supported via the adjusting plate (98) on the wall of the tube (50) transmitting the vertical and horizontal forces and on the side of the oscillating arm (6) facing them. On the side opposite the oscillating arm (6) in relation to the bracing means (72, 95, 96, 97), there are clamping means (10) which, during bracing by the bracing means, guide the vertical forces, acting on the adjusting plate (98) from the connecting rod (3), directly to the oscillating arm (6).
