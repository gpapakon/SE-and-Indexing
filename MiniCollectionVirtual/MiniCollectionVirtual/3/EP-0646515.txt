<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a frame of a cab with engine (driving-unit frame) for a commercial vehicle, comprising two longitudinal frame members (1) for the cab with engine which are arranged next to each other, are connected to each other by transverse-webs and have free ends for connection to U-profiled connecting longitudinal frame members (2) of a vehicle body frame. The intention is for it to be possible to manufacture a frame of this type economically and such that it is easy for mounting and add-on parts to be fitted. For this purpose, the longitudinal frame members (1) for the cab with engine are designed as Z-profiles each having a centre limb (4) which is directed approximately perpendicularly and transverse limbs (5a, 5b) which are directed perpendicularly upwards and outwards and perpendicularly downwards and inwards.

<CLAIMS>
A frame for commercial vehicles and having a frame part at the power end, a frame 
part to be connected to it and disposed at the superstructure end and also lateral longitudinal 

members (1, 2) of the frame parts, which, as profiled members, each have an upright middle web 
and also top and bottom transverse webs and of which those which belong to one longitudinal 

frame side are connected via their middle webs adjacent one another, the longitudinal members 
(2) of the frame parts on the superstructure side, if they are of U-shaped cross-section, being so 

aligned that their transverse webs are towards one another, characterised in that the longitudinal 

members (1) on the power-end frame parts have a Z-shaped cross-section when their top 
transverse webs (5b) are remote from one another while their bottom transverse webs (5a) are 

towards one another, and in that, in the overlapping zone (3) in respect of the longitudinal 
members (2) on the frame side, the bottom transverse webs (5a) of the power-end longitudinal 

members (1) engage under the said longitudinal members (2). 
A frame according to Claim 1, characterised in that the free ends of the power-end 
longitudinal members (1) are constructed for rivetting onto the longitudinal members (2) on the 

superstructure side. 
A frame according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the mutual spacing between the 
power-end longitudinal membes (1) increases towards the front end at which the power unit is 

disposed. 
A frame according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that projections (6) 
are integrally formed on the transverse webs (5) of the power-end longitudinal membes (1) to 

receive attached parts. 
A frame according to Claim 4, characterised in that the projectrions (6) have surface 
portions which are angled over towards one another. 
A frame according to one of the preceding Claims, characterised in that the middle webs 
(4) of the power-end longitudinal members (1) have, at their front ends, end portions which are 

angled over inwardly or outwardly by about 90Â°.
