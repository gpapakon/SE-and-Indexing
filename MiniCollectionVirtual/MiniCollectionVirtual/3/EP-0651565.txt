<ABSTRACT>
A first clamp circuit (2) clamps a tip of a synchronization signal 
of input video signal in accordance with a synchronization signal 

generated from a synchronization signal generator (3) and outputs a 
clamped video signal. A level detector (4) detects a level of a tip of a 

synchronization signal of the clamped video signal. A converter (5) 
converts the detected level to a reference level signal so that the greater 

the detected level becomes, the smaller the reference level signal 
becomes. A second clamp circuit (7) clamps the tip of the synchronization 

signal of the clamped video signal to the reference level signal and 
outputs an output video signal. Thus, the second clamp circuit 

compensates a remaining sag component included in the input video 
signal accurately.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a sag compensation circuit for a
video signal for compensating a sag of the video signal caused by loss
of a low frequency component of the video signal.If an input video signal includes a sag component, a
luminance gradient, which is not included in the original picture,
appears in a reproduced video signal on a display or the like and results
in a degradation of picture quality. In order to improve the picture
quality, the sag must be compensated.Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, two examples of a conventional
sag compensation circuit will now be described.Fig. 1 shows a block diagram of a first conventional sag
compensation circuit. The first conventional circuit consists of:
a clamp circuit 2 for clamping a tip, or a peak of a
synchronization signal of an input video signal 1 to a reference voltage
in accordance with a generated synchronization signal and for outputting
an output video signal 8; anda synchronization signal generator 3 for generating the
generated synchronization signal based on the input video signal.The clamp circuit 2 includes:
a capacitor 21 having one electrode connected to the input
video signal and another electrode connected to one end of a switch 23;a Clamp Pulse Generator (CPG) 22 for generating a clamp
pulse signal in accordance with the generated synchronization signal;a Reference Voltage Source (RVS) 24 for supplying the
reference voltage; andthe switch 23, the other end of which is connected to the
reference voltage source, the switch 23 opens or closes in accordance
with the clamp pulse signal.The synchronization signal generator 3 generates the
generated synchronization signal which synchronizes with the synchronization
signal of the input video signal. In response to the generated
synchronization signal, the clamp pulse generator 22 generates the
clamp pulse signal which causes the switch 22 to close at the tip of the
synchronization signal of the input video signal. By the operations of
the switch 22 and the capacitor 21, a predetermined portion of an output
video signal 8 (for example, a tip of a synchronization signal of the
output video signal) is clamped, or level-shifted to near the reference
voltage of the reference voltage generator 24.However, the first conventional sag compensation circuit has
a problem that a small residual sag component remains in the output
video signal. This is because a resistance component of the switch 22
prevents a tip level of a synchronization signal of the output video
signal from being set to the reference
