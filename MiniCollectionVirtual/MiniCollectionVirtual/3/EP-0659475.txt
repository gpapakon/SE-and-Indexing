<ABSTRACT>
A processing vessel in which a temperature 
control element (5) having a helical flow passage (9) 

formed on an outer surface of an inner barrel (6) 
containing a processing liquid and a heating or cooling 

temperature control medium caused to flow through the 

flow passage is disposed in a vessel body with a spacing 
formed between the temperature control element and an 

inner surface of the vessel body. The spacing between 
the vessel body and the temperature control element is 

closed at a certain position to form a closed chamber. 
Preferably, a system for generally equalizing the 

pressures in the inner barrel and the closed chamber is 
provided. The temperature control element can be 

assembled in the vessel body after being manufactured 
outside the vessel body. Therefore, the processing 

vessel can be manufactured at an improved efficiency and 
can be maintained by ordinary in-vessel maintenance 

operations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vessel used for a
reaction vessel or an agitation vessel (hereinafter
referred to as "processing vessel") in the field of
chemical, petrochemical and food industries and, more
particularly, to a processing vessel upon which a large
thermal load is imposed during processing, or a
processing vessel suitable for manufacturing such a
product that heat-removing and heating powers are
dominant factors of the productivity with which the
product is produced.In general, a processing vessel of this kind
is constructed in such a manner that a vessel body is
formed as a pressure-proof closed vessel by welding
dished end plates or the like to the opposite ends of a
cylindrical barrel member, and a temperature control
system for removing heat generated in the vessel or for
heating a material contained in the vessel is provided
in the vessel body.As conventional heat removing systems for
processing vessels, there have been known a jacket
system, such as that shown in Fig. 10, in which a jacket 
30 is annexed outside a vessel body 1', an inner pipe
system, such as that shown in Fig. 11, in which a
helical pipe 31 is fixedly disposed inside the internal
surface of a vessel body 1', another inner pipe system,
such as that shown in Fig. 12, in which a pipe 32
extending mainly along the longitudinal direction of a
vessel body 1' inside the inner surface of the vessel
body and having its ends elbow-connected are fixedly
disposed by being meandered along the circumferential
direction of the vessel body, an inner jacket system,
such as that shown in Fig. 13, in which partition plates
33 are arranged at certain intervals perpendicularly to
the inner surface of a vessel body 1', and inner strips
34 are disposed so as to extend between the inner ends
of the partition plates 33, whereby a helical flow
passage 35 is formed between the inner strips 34 and the
inner surface of the vessel body 1' by being partitioned
by the partition plates 33 (Japanese Patent Unexamined
Publication No. 57-147502), and other types.In the jacket system arranged for heat
exchange through the wall of the vessel body as shown in
Fig. 10, the thickness of the plate forming the vessel
body is ordinarily increased in order to set a
structural strength large enough to withstand the
pressure generated in the vessel body and the jacket, so
that the heat transfer rate is disadvantageously low.
If the size of the vessel is increased, the thickness of 
the vessel body wall must be increased to obtain the
desired strength. Therefore, it
