<ABSTRACT>
The description relates to an improved extrusion moulder with at least two moulding slots to apply one or more magnetisable coatings to a flexible non-magnetic substrate. Here, the upper lip of the outlet aperture is further back than the lower lip and in addition, opposite the outlet aperture for the dispersions from the extrusion moulder and on the other side of the substrate there is the edge of a parallelepiped magnet having a gradient towards the extrusion slot greater than 400 A/cm, thus producing a stabilised liquid support. It is thus possible to cast very thin coatings and to make the meniscus insensitive to disruptive forces. To reduce the edge bead a doctor blade (13) is fitted on both casting edges which is extended over the region of the upper or lower lip of the extrusion moulder towards the material web (1) to which the coating is applied, a minimum distance of 0.05 to 0.8 mm being set between the surface (19) of the doctor blade (13) and the coated material web.

A process for applying one or more magnetizable 
layers one on top of the other to a flexible nonmagnetic 

substrate by means of an extrusion coater having at least 
two coater slots (8, 8'), wherein the upper edge (11) of 

the upper outlet orifice (8) arranged in the transport 
direction of the substrate is recessed with respect to 

the lower edge (12) of the lower outlet orifice (8'), a 
right parallelepiped magnet (2) whose upper edge (5) is 

opposite the common outlet orifice (3) of the coater 
slots at a distance of from 0.1 to 5 mm away therefrom is 

arranged behind the substrate (1) and parallel thereto, 
a stripping plate (13) which extends essentially 

perpendicular to the outlet orifice (3) is mounted at 
both coating edges, the outflowing coating dispersion (2) 

runs off along the inner surface (17) of the stripping 
plate (13), and the stripping plate (13) is extended by 

an amount (a) beyond the lower or upper extruder edge 
(11, 12) in the direction of the material web (1). 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
coater orifice (3) has a width of from 0.2 to 0.8 mm, and 

the horizontal distance of the upper edge (11) from the 
lower edge (12) is from 0.5 to 1.5 mm. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
stretching ratio of the dispersions applied from the 

coater slots (8, 8') onto the substrate is up to 1 : 50. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the size of the field gradient of the edge (5) of 

the magnet, which gradient is directed toward the coater 
orifice (3), is more than 400 A/cm. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4,  
 

wherein the field strength of the magnet (2) in the 
running direction of the coated substrate (1, 10) is from 

80 to 400 A/cm. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
angle between coater orifice (3) and inner surface (17) 

of the stripping plate (13) is from 90 to 105Â°. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
distance between the surface (19) of the stripping plate 

(13), which faces the material web (1) and is parallel to 
the coater orifice (3), and the coated material web (1) 

is from 0.05 to 0.8 mm. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
distance between the run-off surface (14) of the projecting 

lower lip (12) of the extrusion coater and the coated 
material web (1) is from 1 to 1.5 mm.
