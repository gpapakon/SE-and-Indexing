<ABSTRACT>
The quality classes of arriving short cells and
the ATM virtual connections to be multiplexed are

identified based on the CIDs of those short cells.
Those short cells are written into FIFO memories

corresponding to the ATM virtual connections and
quality classes. A VC specification control section

specifies one ATM virtual connection for each ATM cell
sending timing. At this time, a sequence specification

control section specifies one or more quality classes
in sequence. A readout control section reads one or

more short cells out from the FIFO memory in
accordance with the specified ATM virtual connection

and quality class, stores them in one ATM cell and
sends the ATM cell to the ATM virtual connection

specified by the VC specification control section.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device that stores variable length packets in fixed length packets. In particular, it relates to a device that multiplexes AAL Type 2 short cells on an ATM connection.In recent years, various types of information are being transferred via networks. However, the transmission rate and quality (delay time, error rate, etc.) required for each type of communication service are different. For example, when audio data are transferred, a slow transmission rate is sufficient, but it is necessary to keep the delay time as short as possible. When motion picture data are transferred, fast transmission rate and short delay time are required at the same time. Meanwhile,when E-mail and files are transferred, or when control signals are transferred, the requirement regarding delay time is not so strict. ATM has become a widespread technology for handling a unified communication service that provides various transmission rates and qualities as described above.In ATM, information is transferred stored in fixed length ATM cells. An ATM cell consists of a 5-byte header and a 48-byte payload. Routing information, etc. is stored in the header, while the information to be transferred is stored in the payload.Fig. 1 is a configuration diagram of a CLAD. A CLAD (CeLl Assembly and Disassembly unit) has a function that stores information to be transferred in ATM cells and a function that extracts information stored in the ATM cells and reproduces the transferred information.Fig. 1 shows the cell assembly section of a CLAD. This CLAD consists of a data storage buffer 501, a data amount monitoring section 502, a readout control section 503 and an ATM cell header assembly section 504. Input data are stored in the data storage buffer 501 in the order in which they arrive. The data amount monitoring section 502 monitors the amount of data stored in the data storage buffer 501; when enough data to make a cell (for example 48 bytes) have accumulated, that fact is posted to the readout control section 503. When the readout control section 503 receives this notice, it reads out enough data for 1 cell from the data storage buffer 501; then the ATM cell header assembly section 504 appends a header to the data that were read out to generate a cell and the cell is sent out.In communication using ATM, normally the transferred information is stored in ATM cell payloads for the transfer. A connection that transfers ATM cells is identified by VPI/VCI. One ATM cell stores information that is transmitted via one
