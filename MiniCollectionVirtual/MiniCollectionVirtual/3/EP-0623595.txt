<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to guanidinyl- or 
amidinyl-substituted heterocyclic compounds, which 
are thrombin inhibitors and thus useful in inhibiting 
formation of thrombi. The guanidinyl- or amidinyl-substituted 
heterocyclic thrombin inhibitors of the invention 
have the structure I 
including all stereoisomers thereof, wherein n is 0, 
l or 2;
 
 
   X is S, SO, SO₂ or O;
 
   R¹ is -A-R², where A is an alkyl, alkenyl, or 
alkynyl chain of 2 to 6 carbon atoms and R² is 
guanidine, amidine, or amino; or
 
   R¹ is -(CH₂)p-A'-R2' where R2' is amidine and 
A' is an azacycloalkyl ring of 4 to 8 atoms, 
optionally substituted by alkyl, CO or halo as given 
by the structure 
   where p is 0, l or 2, m is 0, l, 2, 3 or 4, 
N and X are separated by at least two carbon atoms; 
and
 
   Y₁, Y₂ are independently H, alkyl, halo or 
keto(oxo); or
 
   R¹ is -(CH₂)p-A''-R2'',
 
   wherein R2'' is guanidine, amidine or 
aminomethyl, and A'' is aryl or cycloalkyl;
 
   R³ and R⁴ are independently hydrogen, lower 
alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, hydroxy, alkoxy, keto(oxo), 
thioketal, thioalkyl, thioaryl, amino or alkylamino, 
or R³ and R⁴ together with the carbons to which they 
are attached form a cycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl 
ring;
 
   R⁵ is hydrogen, hydroxyalkyl, aminoalkyl, 
amidoalkyl, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, arylalkyl, 
alkenyl, alkynyl, arylalkoxyalkyl, or an amino acid 
side chain, either protected or unprotected; and

-SO₂R⁷ or -CO₂R⁷ (wherein 
R⁷ is lower alkyl, aryl, cycloheteroalkyl or 
heteroaryl);
 
   including pharmaceutically acceptable salts 
thereof. Preferred are compounds of formula I wherein X 
is S or SO₂, n is 0, R¹ is -CH₂(CH₂)q-R², q is l, 2, 3 
or 4; more preferably 
R³ and R⁴ are each H, R⁵ is H or -CH₂OH, and R⁶ is
