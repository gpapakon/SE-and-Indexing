Claims for the following Contracting States : DE, GB
Electron collector having an anode constituted by a substrate (21, 40,
41) on which are deposited conductive strips (23, 43), each raised to a

variable potential making it possible to bring them into a collecting or
non-collecting state, each of these strips having a central portion

defined by edges, characterized in that a layer (25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 53,
55) of a dielectric material is deposited on at least one edge of each

conductive strip, said layer not entirely covering the spaces between
the strips, the dielectric material having a dielectric constant permitting

a reduction of the electric field at the edge of the conductive strips
on which the layer is deposited.

being deposited on each edge of each conductive strip.
Electron collector according to one of the claims 1 or 2, the dielectric
material layer (25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 53, 55) extending beyond the

edge of the conductive strip on which it is deposited and encroaching on
the central portion of said strip.
