<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method for continually heating electrically conductive bulk materials by utilising their electrical resistance, in a furnace space having an inflow opening (delivery opening) and an outlet device (discharge device) for the continual throughput of bulk materials, electric energy being introduced into the material while the material passes through, and to a device for continually heating electrically conductive bulk materials by using their electrical resistance, in a furnace space (1) having an inflow opening (15) and a continual outlet device (9) for the bulk material and having at least one pair of electrodes (14, 16, 19) by means of which electric energy is introduced into the material while the material continuously passes through, to create a device in which heat is continually introduced in an efficient manner into electrically conductive bulk materials during the continual passage of material by utilising their electrical resistance, it is proposed according to the invention that, with respect to the method, the material is guided between the positive and negative electrodes essentially parallel to the current direction and that the outlet device is used at least as part of the negative electrode or the neutral conductor, and that, with respect to the device, the positively poled electrode or phase electrode (14) is located near the inflow opening (15) and the negatively poled electrode or neutral-conductor electrode (16, 9) is provided in the region of the outlet device (9) and the negatively poled electrode or neutral-conductor electrode (16, 9) and the outlet device (9) are connected to earth.
