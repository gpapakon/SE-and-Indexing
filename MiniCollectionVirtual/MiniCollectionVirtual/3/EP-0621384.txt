<ABSTRACT>
The key has, in the shank, a continuous bore (8), in which two opposed control elements (9, 10) are mounted, these elements being movable inwards counter to the restoring force of a compression spring (12) arranged in the bore (8). When the key is inserted into a keyway (2) of the rotary lock cylinder, an additional tumbler (15) is raised by one control element (10), this tumbler engaging radially into a recess (6a) of the stator (3). In the case of a key without a control element (10), the rotor is blocked by the tumbler (15). When a key (2) according to the invention is used, the rotor (1) can be rotated, the tumbler (15) being lifted out of the recess (6a) and the control element (10) being moved radially inwards. After a rotation through, for example, 90@, a counterbolt (16) of the stator (3) is put in place by the tumbler (15). Here too, if the control element (10) is absent, the rotor (1) is blocked by the counterbolt (16).

<CLAIMS>
Key and cylinder for a safety lock, the cylinder
having a rotor (1), a stator (3) and a plurality of

tumblers and the key (7) is provided with at least one control
element (9, 10) which is arranged in the shank of the

key (7), has a control face (9b, 10b) which is flush
with an outer side (7a) of the key (7) and interacts

with an additional tumbler (15) of the rotor (1), the
control element (9, 10) being radially displaceable

counter to the restoring force, for example of a
compression spring (12), the stator (3) having, on the

inner side, a recess (6a) in which the additional
tumbler (15) of the rotor (1) engages due to the action

of the control element (9, 10), and when the rotor (1)
is turned, it being possible for the additional tumbler

(15) to be moved radially inwards counter to the
restoring force, and a counter-bolt (16) being arranged

with spacing from the recess (6a), characterized in that
the additional tumbler (15) has a conical control face

(15a) and, in the case of a corresponding turned
position of the rotor (1), the control element (9, 10)

is held by the said restoring force in a position in
which its control face (9b, 10b) is flush with a narrow

side (7a) of the key (7) and the conical control face
(15a) of the additional tumbler (15) interacts with a

conical bore (22) of the counter-bolt (16) in order to
position the latter.
Key and cylinder according to Claim 1,
characterize
d in that an insert (6) is inserted into a
recess (29) of the stator (3), which insert has the 

recess (6a) which interacts with the additional tumbler
(15).
Key and cylinder according to Claim 2,
characterized in that the insert (6) consists of

hardened steel or hard metal.
Key and cylinder according to Claim 3,
characterized in that the insert is of curved design.
Key and cylinder according to one of Claims 1 to
4, characterized in that the recess (6a) is a conical

bore.
Key and cylinder according to one of Claims 1 to
5, characterized in that the additional tumbler (15) is

a bolt which is guided displaceably in a bush (13).
Key and cylinder according to one of Claims 1 to
6, characterized in that the shank of the key (7) has a

continuous stepped bore (8) into which a compression
spring (12) is inserted, which acts upon two mutually

opposite control elements (9, 10).
Key and cylinder according to Claim 7,
characterized in that a casing (11) is pressed into the

stepped bore (8), in which casing a control element (10)
is guided.
Key and cylinder according to Claim 8,
characterized in that the control elements (9, 10) each

have, at the inner end, a flange (9a, 10a) which rests
against a shoulder (8a) or the casing (11).
