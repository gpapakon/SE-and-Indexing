<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a stackable container unit for containing food products during their cooking, the unit consisting essentially of lengthwise troughs (1 to 4; 21 to 24) that form the containers and are arranged side by side. It comprises a plurality of long crosswise partitioning plates (7 to 9; 27 to 29) running across the troughs (1 to 4; 21 to 24) and each being, within each trough, of a shape that fits the shape of the trough, at least in its upper part, in such a way as to leave at the bottom of each plate a free space between said plate and the bottom of the trough. In the free spaces (30) between two neighbouring troughs (22 and 23), vertical lengthwise plates (38) are mounted between the front and rear crosswise strengthening plates (25 and 26). At each point of intersection with a crosswise partitioning plate (27 to 29), the lengthwise plate (38) has a notch (39) open on the side facing down and corresponding in width to the thickness of the crosswise partitioning plate (27 to 29). Each crosswise partitioning plate (27 to 29) has a notch (40) open on the side facing up and equal in width to the thickness of the lengthwise plate (38). The two notches (39 and 40) are engaged with each other and then welded.

Stackable set of containers designed to contain food 
products during cooking, essentially made up of 

longitudinal channels (1 to 4; 21 to 24) which form the 
containers and which are arranged side by side, 

characterized in that it includes a plurality of 
transversal partitioning plates (7 to 9; 27 to 29) which 

span the channels (1 to 4; 21 to 24) in turn and each of 
which has, opposite each channel, a profile which takes 

the exact form of the channel, at least in its upper 
portion, in such a way as to leave a free space at the 

bottom of each plate between it and the bottom of the 
channel, slots (41 and 42) which are open towards the 

bottom being provided in each transversal partitioning 
plate (27 to 29) respectively opposite each vertical 

portion of channel wall, and a slot (43, 44) which is open 
towards the top being provided in each vertical portion of 

channel wall opposite said slots (41 and 42). 
Set of containers according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that an empty space (10; 30) is provided between two 

adjacent channels, which improves the heat-transfer of 
the heat-conveying liquid and which facilitates washing 

after use. 
Set of containers according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that, in the free spaces (30) between two adjacent 

channels (22 and 23), vertical longitudinal plates (38) 
are fitted between the front and rear transversal 

reinforcing plates, joined to the front ends of the 
channels (21 to 24), (25 and 26), and at each point of 

intersection with a transversal partitioning plate (27 to 
29), the longitudinal plate (38) has a slot (39) which is 

open towards the bottom and has a width corresponding with 
the thickness of the transversal partitioning plate (27 to 

29) and each transversal partitioning plate (27 to 29) has 
a slot (40), which is open towards the top and has a width 

equal to the thickness of the longitudinal plate (38), the 
two slots (39 and 40) being interlocked, then welded.  

 
Set of containers according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that, between the longitudinal reinforcing plates (31, 32) 

joined to the outer walls of the outer channels (21, 24), 
vertical transversal girder plates (55, 56) are provided, 

the upper edge of each one having, underneath each channel 
(21 to 27), a first cut-out (59) corresponding with the 

profile of the bottom of a channel, and at each point of 
intersection with a longitudinal plate (38), the upper 

edge of the girder plate (55, 56) has a slot (58) which 
co-operates with a slot (57) in the lower edge of the 

longitudinal plate (38), the two slots (57, 58) being 
interlocked. 
Set of containers according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that the lower edge of each girder plate (55, 56) has, 

directly below the first cut-out (59), a second cut-out 
(60) corresponding with the profile of the upper part of a 

cover (51 to 54) onto which the latter is hooked. 
Set of containers according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that, between the lateral supports each 

made up of a longitudinal bar (13, 14, 33, 34) provided 
with a leg (15, 35) at each end and the outer walls of 

the outer channels (1, 4; 21, 24), longitudinal vertical 
reinforcing plates (11, 12; 31, 32) are respectively 

fitted which drop below the horizontal plane of the 
bottoms of the channels and possibly of the edges of the 

covers but remain higher than the lower ends of the legs 
(15; 35), and of which the lower portion (16, 17; 36, 37) 

is turned inwards, so as to form a supporting surface 
which, in conjunction with that of the other reinforcing 

plate, can be raised by the forks of a fork lift truck.
