<ABSTRACT>
A device (1) for encapsulating container closures protruding upwards, in particular cask fittings (F), comprises a cap feeder (4) and a cap press-on arrangement (5) above a longitudinal conveyor (3) for the containers (B) to be encapsulated. In order to achieve an efficient operation largely independent of the shape and weight of the containers, the cap press-on arrangement (5) has a slide (12) movable parallel to the longitudinal conveyor (3), the slide (12) is equipped with a downwardly directed lifting ram (13), a cap carrier (15) arranged in the direction of longitudinal conveyance, pivotable about a horizontal transverse axis (16) and receiving a cap holder (20) at its free end (19) is mounted on the underside of the lifting ram (13), and the slide (12) is movable from a take-over position, in which the cap carrier (15) is located in the region of a cap outlet (8) of the cap feeder (4), into an initial position, in which the cap carrier (15) is swung down into the conveying region of the longitudinal conveyor (3), and then along a press-on zone, in the course of which the lifting ram (13) is actuable, into an end position, and back.

A device (1) for encapsulating high-standing 
container closures, particularly drum or cask fittings 

(F), comprising a cap feed (4) and a cap press-on 
device (5) above a longitudinal conveyor (3) for the 

containers (B) for encapsulation, the cap press-on 
device (5) comprising a slide (12) drivable in 

reciprocation parallel to the longitudinal conveyor (3) 
and with a punch (13) for pressing down from an upper 

inoperative position into a pressing-on position, a cap 
carrier (15) is mounted on the underside of the 

reciprocating punch (13) and receives a cap-holder (20) 
at its free end (19), and the slide (12) in cooperation 

with control switches (25) is movable from a 
take-over position in which the cap carrier (15) lies 

in the neighbourhood of a cap outlet (8) of the cap 
feed (4) into a starting position and then along a 

pressing-on zone during which the reciprocating punch 
(13) can be actuated, up to an end position and back, 

characterised in that the cap carrier (15) is disposed 
in the direction of longitudinal conveyance and is 

pivotable, limited by an abutment, around a horizontal 
transverse axis (16) and in the starting position the 

cap carrier (15) is pivotable into the conveying region 
of the longitudinal conveyor (3). 
A device according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the punch (13) and the slide drive comprise 

pneumatic cylinders (23).  
 
A device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the slide (12) is without a drive in the 

pressing-on zone. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the cap carrier (15) has a holder 

(20) in the form of a sucker (21) to which negative 
pressure can be applied. 
A device according to any of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the side (12) and the cap outlet 

(8) are situated on a vertically adjustable supporting 
frame (28).
