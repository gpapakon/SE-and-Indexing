<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a novel N-phenoxyalkyl-substituted 
pyrazolecarboxamide derivative (hereinafter abbreviated 
to as "phenoxyalkylamine derivative") which is a 
chemical for controlling noxious organisms useful as an 
insecticide, an acaricide and a fungicide. As phenoxyalkylamine derivatives, there have been disclosed, 
for example, quinazoline derivatives in Japanese 
Provisional Patent Publications No. 17123/1979 (which 
corresponds to U.S. Patent No. 4,213,987, hereinafter the 
same), No. 76803/1980 and No. 76804/1980 (both of which 
correspond to U.S. Patent No. 4,304,778), a thienopyrimidine 
derivative in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication 
No. 42387/1984 (U.S. Patent No. 4,562,193), pyrimidine 
derivatives in Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 
36666/1984, No. 36667/1984 (both of which correspond to 
U.S. Patent No. 4,435,402), No. 286373/1986 and No. 67/1987 
(both of which correspond to U.S. Patent No. 4,845,097), 
and a pyrazole derivative in Japanese Provisional Patent  
 
Publication No. 27360/1991 (US Patent No. 5,039,692). EP-A-0 356 158 discloses an insecticide or bactericide including an 
aminopyrimidine derivatives of general formula 
 
wherein inter alia the group Y may represent an alkyleneoxy 
substituted phenyl group. However, a novel phenoxyalkylamine derivative and a novel 
phenoxyalkylamide derivative as in the present invention 
have not been reported. Thus, a method for synthesizing a phenoxyalkylamine derivative 
from a phenoxyalkylamide derivative of the present 
invention has not been known, and it has not been known 
that the resulting phenoxyalkylamine derivative has an 
activity of controlling noxious organisms such as an insecticidal, 
acaricidal or fungicidal activity. An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 
phenoxyalkylamine derivative, a process for preparing the 
same and an agricultural and horticultural chemical for 
controlling noxious organisms containing said derivative as 
an active ingredient, which is useful as an insecticide, an 
acaricide and a fungicide.  
 The present inventors have found that a novel phenoxyalkylamine 
derivative obtained by synthesizing from a novel 
phenoxyalkylamide derivative has remarkable controlling 
activities such as insecticidal, acaricidal and fungicidal 
activities useful as an agricultural and horticultural 
chemical for controlling noxious organisms, to accomplish 
the present invention. That is a first invention is concerned with a phenoxyalkylamine
