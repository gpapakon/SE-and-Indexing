<ABSTRACT>
This invention provides a composition and a kit to prepare 
the composition, and articles made from the composition, which 

composition comprises polyethylene terephthalate, a nucleating 
agent having a defined Nucleation Index and optionally a 

polyolefin and a heat stabilizer. A particularly effective 
nucleating agent is polytetrafluoroethylene.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to foamable polyester compositions having
nucleating agents to promote crystallization. The compositions are useful
for making foamed articles by thermoforming the nucleated
crystalline polyesters.Polyesters are widely used for articles for which non
toxicity, good heat stability, resistance to deformation and ease
of manufacture are important. Polyethylene terephthalate ("PET")
has, for example, become the material of choice for dual ovenable
(the ability to be used in conventional ovens as well as
microwave ovens) food packages and trays. Incorporating gas
into the polyester to provide a cellular structure also has
advantages in many applications, and especially dual ovenable
food trays. The cellular structure not only reduces the weight
of polyester needed in sheet and trays, but also provides heat
insulation. Food trays and similar articles are generally made
from polyester by thermoforming. In one process of thermoforming,
polyester sheet is preheated to its deformation temperature and
made to conform to the contours of a mould by vacuum assist
(vacuuming it into the mould), air pressure assist (blowing it
into the mould), plug assist and matched mould assist (forcing it
into the mould). In another process extruded melted sheet is
cooled to the proper forming temperature before moulding by the
means described above. It is essential that the polyester, after
forming, be partially crystalline to maintain good dimensional
stability, stiffness and other desirable properties.
Crystallinity of from 15 to 32 percent after forming is normally
adequate and customary. It is a happy coincidence that
polyesters crystallize upon heating, so that the thermoforming
step plus a period of heat treatment (holding the article at the
moulding temperature for a time) results in the desired
crystallinity. Of course, the polyester must be properly
selected, and have added to it a suitable crystallization 
nucleation agent, i.e. an agent (usually particulate) which
initiates and provides a starting point on which crystallites can
form. It is also necessary to provide some improvement in impact
strength (to prevent or at least reduce shattering). This is
usually achieved by adding a small amount of a polyolefin
component to the polyester blend.For cellular polyester structures, gas addition is
conveniently accomplished in an extruder used to form the sheet.
While other methods can be used, the injection of gas (nitrogen
is preferred for cost, availability, convenience and
environmental friendliness)

<CLAIMS>
A composition for making cellular sheets of crystalline
polyester or thermoformed article(s) having a total

crystallinity in the range of from 10 to 40 weight percent
from such sheets, comprising:


(a) in the range of from 80 weight percent or more of
a polyethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity

of at least 0.60 dl/g;
(b) in the range of from 0.01 to 10 weight percent of
polytetrafluoroethylene;
(c) in the range of from 0.1 to 10 weight percent of
linear low density polyethylene; and
(d) sufficient bubbles of inert gas to provide a
cellular sheet with a density in the range of from 0.04 to

1.25 g/cm
3
.
The composition as claimed in claim 1, in which the
linear low density polyethylene is present in an amount in

the range of from 0.9 weight percent to 1.2 weight percent,
and the polytetrafluoroethylene is present in an amount in

the range of from 0.1 to 0.3 weight percent, said weights
being based on total composition weight.
