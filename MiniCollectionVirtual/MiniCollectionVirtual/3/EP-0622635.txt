<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a current sensor for the isolated measurement of alternating currents. The invention is to enable the cost of current sensors to be reduced and is to overcome geometrical and constructional constraints. This sensor comprises a primary circuit through which the entire current to be measured flows, and a secondary circuit coupled to the primary circuit via a multi-turn compensated isolation transformer. The primary circuit consists of a shunt (SH) of low ohmic value and having good thermal stability, through which more than 99% of the current to be measured flows, Im, and connected, on the one hand, to the primary winding (P1) of the compensated isolation transformer and, on the other hand, to a localised real resistance (R1) in series with the primary winding (P1), having good thermal stability but of a high ohmic value compared to that of the shunt (SH). The secondary windings of the compensated isolation transformer are connected to associated electronics (E). The secondary winding (S1) is connected in parallel to the resistor (R2), the combination being connected, on the one hand, to earth and, on the other hand, to the resistor (R3), the other lead of which is connected to the output Vs, the resistors (R2) and (R3) both having good thermal stability.
