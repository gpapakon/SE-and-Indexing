<DESCRIPTION>
This invention was made with the support of the 
United States Government under National Science 
Foundation Grant No. DMR-9158315 and Office of Naval 
Research Young Investigation Award N00014-89-J-3062. 
The Government has certain rights in this invention. 
This invention relates to a low cost and facile method 
for purification of fullerenes. This invention also 
relates to a composition of matter comprising a 
fullerene adsorbed onto a solid support comprising 
active carbon. The solid support may further comprise 
silica gel, diatomaceous earth, or other materials 
which aid in column packing and eluent flow. Fullerenes are carbon cages containing a central 
cavity. These molecules with the composition C20+2m, 
where m is an integer, can take the stable form of 
hollow closed nets composed of pentagons and hexagons. 
The discovery of Buckminsterfullerene, a C60 spherical 
allotrope of carbon, in 1985 by Kroto, H.W., Heath, 
J.R., O'Brien, S.C., Carl, R.F., Smalley, R.E.; "C60: 
Buckminsterfullerene"; Nature, Vol. 318, November 1985, 
pp. 162-163 has precipitated a flurry of activity 
directed towards understanding the nature and 
properties of fullerenes, particularly their use as 
lubricants, semiconductors and superconductors. This 
research has been significantly hampered by the 
difficulty in obtaining gram or larger quantities of 
pure materials.  
 To date, fullerenes have been synthesized using a 
laser to ablate graphite, burning graphite in a furnace 
or by producing an arc across two graphite electrodes 
in an inert atmosphere. By impregnating graphite with 
metal salts or oxides, or conducting the vaporization 
in a metal containing atmosphere, a metal encapsulated 
in a fullerene can be synthesized. Other techniques 
applied to synthesize fullerenes include negative 
ion/desorption chemical ionization and a benzene flame. 
In each case, a soot comprising a mixture of C60 and C70 
fullerenes, and even higher numbered carbon molecules 
is obtained. For example, carbon arc soot contains 
about 80-85% C60, 10-15% C70, and 5% higher fullerenes. The first and still most commonly used method for 
purifying crude C60 fullerene is by column 
chromatography on activity grade I neutral alumina 
using 5% toluene in hexane as the eluent. However, C60 
fullerene is only very slightly soluble in 
toluene/hexane (5/95) and this low solubility requires 
the use of large quantities of solvent and very large 
columns. The use of larger fractions of toluene in 
hexane afford no separation of C60 from the
