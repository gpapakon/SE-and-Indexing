<ABSTRACT>
Prior art: A supralocal virtual private network (VPNET) is formed by a number of private branch exchanges (PBX2, PBX3) or individual sets (E10) which, if necessary, communicate via public dial-up connections. The setting-up of the dial-up connections is initiated by dialling a service (VPN). Technical problem: The entire supralocal private network (VPNET) should act like one network for callers (C) on the public network (PUBNET). Basic concept: The service supports the switching of calls both from inside and outside the private network (VPNET), but allocates different tariffing attributes to the connections. Solution: IN service which transfers both calls between private branch changes (PBX1, PBX2) of a private network (VPNET) and from outside by means of a private numbering plan but, in doing so, initiates different tariffing. Advantages:     - Uniform company call number. - The same call number when moving from the area of one private branch exchange to that of another one. - Uniform company numbering plan also valid for calls from outside.

A method of routing calls for a virtual private network
(VPNET) comprising several private communication units (COM2 to

COM4), which can be interconnected when necessary through the
switched connections of a public network (PUBNET), where a

service is dialed to make the switched connections, and then
causes further switching on the basis of a private numbering

plan, characterized in that a subscriber (A, B, C) of the public
network (PUBNET), in order to establish a connection to a

subscriber (A, B, C) of the private network (VPNET), dials the
same service which then causes further switching to one of the

private communication units (COM2 to COM4), that the service
assigns charging attributes (TAT) to each connection it has made,


which concern the charge rate of the respective connection in the
public network,
 and that to a connection 
which is requested by
one of the private communication units (COM2 to COM4)
 the service
assigns different charging attributes (TAT) than to other

connections.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that a
private branch exchange (PBX1 to PBX3), which is equipped with

several terminals (E1, E2, E3; E4, E5, E6; E7, E8, E9), is used
as a communication unit (COM1 to COM3).
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that a
single terminal (E10 to E12) is used as a communication unit

(COM4 to COM6).
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the
charging attributes (TAT) establish which subscriber (A, B, C)

pays for a connection.
A method as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the
charging attributes (TAT) establish which group of charges

applies to a connection. 
A method as claimed in claim 4, characterized in that all
the connections within the virtual private network (VPNET) are

paid by the operator of that network, otherwise the calling
subscriber (A, B, C) is charged.
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the
service determines by means of an inserted telephone number (PU2

to PU3; NUM3) belonging to the calling subscriber (A, B, C), if
an incoming call belongs to the virtual private network (VPNET).
A method as claimed in claim 6, characterized in that the
service determines by means of an inserted identification code if

an incoming call belongs to the virtual private network (VPNET).
A service computer (SERV) for connection to a network, with
an interface for communication with at least one exchange (SSP1,

SSP2) 
of a public network (PUBNET),
 with a memory device (MEM)
designed to store data about the private numbering plan 
of
a
private network (VPNET)
 which assigns public telephone numbers
(PU2 to PU4) to private telephone numbers (PR4 to PR10), 
and
 with
a translation device (TRANS) for translating private telephone

numbers (PR4 to PR10) into public telephone numbers (PU2 to PU4),
characterized in that the service computer (SERV) is equipped

with a charging device (TAR) for producing charging attributes
(TAT), 
which concern the charges for the respective connection in
the public network,
 that 
the service computer (SERV) is equipped
with a
 classification device (CLAS) which is designed 
to check
whether a call originates from a communication unit (COM2 to

COM4) of the private network, and
 that it sends data to the
charging device (TAR) about 
whether the call originates from a
communication unit (COM2 to COM4) of the private ne
twork, and
that the charging device is designed to assign different charging

attributes (TAT) to a connection which is requested by one of the
private communication units (COM2 to COM4), than to other

connections.
An exchange of 
a public network (PUBNET),
 with at least one
service computer (SERV), which is equipped with a memory device

(MEM) designed to store data about a private numbering plan 
of a
private network (VPNET),
 which assigns public telephone numbers
(PU2 to PU4) to private telephone numbers (PR4 to PR10), 
and
 with
a translation device (TRANS) for translating private telephone

numbers (PR4 to PR10) into public telephone numbers (PU2 to PU4),
characterized in that the service computer (SERV) is equipped

with a charging device (TAR) for producing charging attributes
(TAT), 
which concern the charges for the respective connection in
the public network,
 that 
the service computer (SERV) is equipped
with a classification device (CLAS),
 which is designed 
to check
whether a call originates from a communication unit (COM2 to

COM4) of the private network, and
 that it sends data to the
charging device (TAR) about 
whether the call originates from a
communication unit (COM2 to COM4) of the private network, and

that the charging device is designed to assign different charging
attributes (TAT) to
a connection which is requested by one of the
private communication units (COM2 to COM4), than to other

connections.
