<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus (10) for supplying melt from a melt-holding 
vessel (20) to a casting machine (12) comprises a ceramic melt 

pump casing or housing (44) submersible in the melt (M). The 
casing includes a melt-pumping chamber with a melt inlet 

and melt outlet (48,50) and a piston-receiving bore communicated 
to the chamber. A piston (46) having a ceramic pumping 

portion is movable in the bore relative to the chamber 
in a suction stroke to draw the melt into the chamber 

through the melt inlet (62) and in a pumping stroke to 
discharge the melt from the chamber through the melt 

outlet (64) to, for example, a melt casting machine (12). A melt 
inlet valve (48) having a ceramic valve portion submersible 

in the melt is movable relative to the melt inlet (62) to 
open/close the melt inlet when the piston pumping 

portion is moved in the respective suction/pumping 
stroke. A melt outlet valve (50) having a ceramic valve 

portion submersible in the melt is movable relative to 
the melt outlet (64) to close/open the melt outlet when the 

piston pumping portion is moved in the respective 
suction/pumping stroke. The casing, piston pumping 

portion, and melt inlet and outlet valve portions are 
supported from the support member so as to be submerged 

in the melt of the melt-holding vessel (20). Actuators 
provided for the piston and melt inlet and outlet valves 

are mounted on the support member above the melt.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to melt pumping 
apparatus especially useful for supplying a metallic 
melt to a casting machine, such as a die casting 
machine, a casting mold, and the like. Die casting machines and processes are well known 
and in widespread use in the high volume manufacture of 
metal or alloy components. In general, a die casting 
machine comprises a fixed die member and a movable die 
member which define therebetween a die cavity in which 
an individual charge of molten metal is introduced and 
solidified to form a die casting. A vertically or 
horizontally oriented shot sleeve is connected to the 
fixed die member and includes an opening through which 
the charge of the molten metal to be cast is introduced 
ahead of a plunger disposed in the shot sleeve. When 
the molten metal charge is introduced into the shot 
sleeve, the plunger is advanced in the shot sleeve 
toward the die members in a manner to introduce the 
charge into the die cavity through a runner or gate 
communicating the die cavity and shot sleeve. After the 
metal solidifies in the die cavity, the movable die 
member is separated from the fixed die member to allow  
 
ejection of the die casting. The die members then are 
closed and another individual molten metal charge is 
introduced into the die cavity to make another die 
casting. This cycle is repeated to make additional die 
castings in high volume. In a typical high volume die casting operation, the 
successive charges of molten metal are supplied to the 
shot sleeve from a heated melt transport ladle that 
receives an appropriate amount (charge) of molten metal 
from a melting furnace and then is moved to the shot 
sleeve where the molten metal charge is poured into the 
shot sleeve for introduction into the die cavity by 
movement of the plunger as described hereabove. Use of the melt transport ladle for introducing 
successive molten metal charges to the shot sleeve is 
time consuming and requires continual movement of the 
melt supply ladle between the melting furnace and the 
shot sleeve of the die casting machine in order to maintain 
production. Moreover, the temperature of the molten 
metal charge can drop considerably during transport from 
the furnace to the shot sleeve. As a result, the melt 
temperature in the melting furnace is maintained higher 
than would otherwise be required. Higher melt 
temperature will aggravate thermal shock to the shot 
sleeve, plunger, and die members when the molten charge 
is supplied thereto. Furthermore, during ladle
