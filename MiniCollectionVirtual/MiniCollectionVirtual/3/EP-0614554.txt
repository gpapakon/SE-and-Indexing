<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method and to an arrangement for effecting uniform revision, such as installation, deinstallation or change, of data in a number of user units (S) that are connectable to a distributed computer system each time revision is to be effected in the user units. With the assistance of an information means (1A) there is created from a general revision recipe (AM) stored in the computer system a specially adapted revision recipe (BM; CM) having a smaller number of questions than the general revision recipe. The specially adapted revision recipe is then used to enable a programm product to be installed uniformly in a plurality of mutually similar user units in the computer system. This installation process requires less information or no further information from the user unit.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method as specified 
in the precharacterising part of Claim 1. Given below is a list of the expressions used in the 
present document and their meaning: 
administratora person who administers a computer 
system information basea computer stored data base which 
contains some type of information interpretera program which can convert one 
data structure to another data 
structure recipespecial information or help 
software which describes how a given 
software shall be revised,i.e. created, 
installed, de-installed, 
changed and/or configured on a 
computer, and the information required 
to execute this mass revisionrevision of the same software 
in a large number of units of a computer 
system gatewaya device which mutually connects two 
communication networks which use 
different communication protocol, 
i.e. a "protocol converter" bridgea simplified gateway which can be 
used to mutually connect two homogenous 
local communication networks. When installing software in computer systems, the same 
installation process has been repeated traditionally for 
each unit in the computer system into which the software 
shall be installed (see e.g. EP-A-0398647). Consequently, the installation 
information required, which is normally obtained by 
putting questions to the user, must be given time and 
time again, which is both time consuming and involves 
the risk of error. Furthermore, this procedure will 
often result in the installations not being carried out 
identically - an inhomogenous system is obtained which 
can later lead to problems when, for instance, reconfiguring 
or updating the software. This particularly 
applies when installing software in computer systems 
which comprise a large number of mutually similar units 
in which it is desired to install a software in a unitary 
manner. 
Since the various user units often work individually 
alternatively disconnected from and connected to the 
system and can then send from the system data that has 
been created by software installed in the unit, it is 
very important that the data has been fully adapted to 
the distributed computer system. Otherwise errors can 
occur which are difficult to unravel and rectify. For 
instance, it is relatively usual for a program manufacturer 
to insert changes in marketed software. This 
modified software is often sold together with an installation 
program without mention of the changes made. When 
such newly purchased software is installed with the aid 
of its installation program in

<CLAIMS>
A method for achieving uniform revision, such as 
installation, deinstallation or change, of data in a 

number of user units (S) which are connectable to a distributed 
computer system (A), each time revision shall be effected 

in said units,
characterized
 by
 
storing a general revision recipe (AM) containing a 

number of questions in a first user unit (1-15) in the 
computer system;
 
creating a specially adapted revision recipe (BM;CM), by 

processing the general revision recipe (AM) in the first 
user unit (1-15) with the assistance of an information 

means (1A), said specially adapted revision recipe 
(BM;CM) including a smaller number of questions than the 

general revision recipe (AM);
 
revising data in second, mutually similar user units, 

with the aid of the specially adapted revision recipe 
(BM;CM) which requires less or no further information 

when carrying out the revision, and therewith producing 
uniform revision of data, such as a program product, in 

a plurality of second user units in the computer system. 
A method according to Claim 1, 
characterized
 
in that the specially adapted revision 

recipe totally lacks questions, so that no information 
is required from the user unit during a revision process. 
A method according to Claim 1 or 2, 
characterized
 
in that the information means (1A) 

produces the answers to the questions that are answered 
to produce the specially adapted revision recipe with 

the aid of information in a data base (6) concerning the 
user unit or user units to which the specially adapted  

 
recipe shall be adapted. 
A method according to any one of the preceding 
claims, 
characterized
 by the steps of: 

a) copying (21) the general recipe; 
b) searching (22-34) through the copy and for each question 
found pass the question to an information means 

which at least includes the possibility of 
either answering the question, wherein the question 

in the copy is replaced by the answer given, 
or of leaving the question unanswered, wherein the 

question in the copy is left unanswered; and 
c) saving (35) the modified copy of the general recipe 
(AM) as the specially adapted recipe (BM;CM) 

after having searched through the entire copy. 
A method according to Claim 4, 
characterized
 
in that step b) also includes the possibility 

of the information means reducing the number of 
answer alternatives in the case of a question having 

given answer alternatives, wherein the question in the 
copy of the general recipe is modified so as not to 

include the undesirable alternatives. 
A method according to Claim 4 or 5, 
characterized
 
in that the step b) also includes the 

possibility for the information means to change a preset 
answer to a question that has no given answer alternatives, 

wherein the question in the copy of the general 
recipe is modified in a manner to present this answer as 

a pre-set answer. 
A method according to any one of Claims 4-6, 

characterized
 in that step b) also includes 
the possibility for the information means to change a 

pre-set answer alternative to a question having given  
 

answer alternatives, wherein the question in the copy of 
the general recipe is modified to have this answer 

alternative as the pre-set answer alternative.

characterized
 in that step b) also includes 
the possibility for the information means to eliminate a 

repeatable question, wherein the question in the copy of 
the general recipe is eliminated.

possibility for the information means to give at least 
one answer to the question, wherein the question in the 

copy of the general recipe is replaced by the answer or 
answers given by the information means. 
A computer system arrangement comprising a plurality 
of computer units wherein uniform revision, such as 

installation, deinstallation or change to data in some 
user units (S) connectable or connected to a distributed 

computer system (A) can be achieved each time that

of questions is stored as a data file in the non-volatile 

memory (2) and can be loaded over to 
the central memory (5); 
b) that the central memory (5) has stored therein an 
operative system (9) which includes file copying 

possibilities such as to enable the general recipe  
 

(AM) stored in the central memory (5) to be copied;

d) the arrangement further includes 
an information base 

(6) stored in the non-volatile memory (2), 
wherein the information in the information base 

(6) is used to answer or to change questions in 
the copy of the general recipe (AM) stored in 

the central memory (5) and therewith to produce 
a specially adapted revision recipe for mutually similar user units, and further 
e) includes possibilities of handling files in the 
operative system (48), wherein a recipe stored
