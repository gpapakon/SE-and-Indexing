<ABSTRACT>
A portable crane (1) for use on a pickup or utility truck is disclosed. The crane (1) has a mounting base (2) rotatably mountable to a tray of the motor vehicle. The crane (1) includes a post (7) connectable to a base frame (5) which is welded to the mounting base (2). A lifting arm (25) and a brace (32) are telescopically arranged for different use configurations. The post (7), the brace (32) and the lifting arm (25) are able to be folded together to be substantially parallel when the crane (1) is in its folded configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
 A CRANE The present invention relates to cranes and, in particular, to a portable crane for use on a motor vehicle. * BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION5 When using a small pickup truck or utility truck it is often the *- case that heavy loads are lifted onto and from the tray of the truck. It is therefore desirable to have a small portable crane which is able to be mounted on the tray of the truck to do the lifting.OBJECT OF THE INVENTION 10 It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved crane which is is to be used on a motor vehicle.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the present invention there is disclosed a crane comprising a mounting base rotatably mountable to a tray of a 15 motor vehicle, a base frame member attachable to said mounting base and which extends substantially parallel to said tray, a post which connects at one end to said base frame member and which extends substantially perpendicularly from said base fÂ»-ame member, a lifting arm which pivotally connects to other end of said post, and a brace which extends 20 between said mounting base and said lifting arm, wherein said crane is able to be folded from a use configuration to a folded configuration so that said post, said brace and said lifting arm are substantially parallel when said crane is in said folded configuration.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS 25 One embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings in which:Fig. 1 is a side view of a crane of a preferred embodiment illustrated in one operating configuration,Fig. 2 is a side view of the crane of Fig. 1 illustrated in another 30 operating configuration,Fig. 3 is a side view of the crane of Fig. 1 illustrated in a folded configuration, andFig. 4 is a side view of the crane of Fig. 1 illustrated in an intermediate stage of the folding procedure. 35 BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTIONThe crane 1 is shown as erected in Figs. 1 and 2. The crane 1 includes a mounting base 2 which is rotatably mounted into a recess on the tray of a motor vehicle (not illustrated) such as a pickup truck or 

 the like. The mounting base 2 includes a round pipe 3 and a circular flange 4. The round pipe 3 fits within the recess with the circular flange 4 resting on the tray of the motor vehicle.Protruding perpendicularly to the pipe 3 is a rectangular hollow section tube (RHS) of a base frame 5. The base frame 5 is welded to the pipe 3, and a bracing triangular plate 6 is welded on the opposite side to provide strength.A RHS

CLAIMS :
1. A crane comprising a mounting base rotatably mountable to a tray of a motor vehicle, a base frame member attachable to said mounting base and which extends substantially parallel to said tray, a post which connects at one end to said base frame member and which extends substantially perpendicularly from said base frame member, a lifting arm which pivotally connects to other end of said post, and a brace which extends between said mounting base and said lifting arm, wherein said crane is able to be folded from a use configuration to a folded configuration so that said post, said brace and said lifting arm are substantially parallel when said crane is in said folded configuration.
2. The crane as claimed in claim 1, wherein said post and said lifting arm are connected by at least one connecting strip and said lifting arm and said brace are connected by at least one connecting strip 3. The crane as claimed in claim 2 wherein said connecting strip(s) are fixedly secured to said lifting arm and are pivotally attachable to said post and said brace respectively.
4. The crane as claimed in claim 3, wherein said brace and said lifting arm are telescopic. 5. The crane as claimed in any one of claims 1-4, wherein said crane includes a winch with a rope attached thereto, said rope having its free end associated with the lifting arm.
6. The crane as claimed in claim 5, wherein said winch is attached to a mounting bracket on said post. 7. The crane as claimed in claim 6, wherein said mounting bracket is pivotally detachable from said post, so that said winch is movable from said use configuration to said folded configuration.
8. The crane as claimed 1n any one of claims 2-7, wherein said connecting strips use pins to connect the parts together. 9. The crane as claimed in any one of claims 1-8, wherein said crane has a handle and is able to be carried by hand.
