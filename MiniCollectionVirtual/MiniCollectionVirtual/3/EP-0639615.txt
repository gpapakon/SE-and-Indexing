<ABSTRACT>
Improved organophilic clay gellants for highly viscous systems 
such as asphalt and creosote can be prepared by a process wherein the 

smectite-type clay is gently dried and/or subjected to minimum or no 
grinding. The organophilic clay agent may be used to thicken a 

variety of organic compositions including pitch and heavy resins. In 
a preferred aspect, the organophilic clay gellant can be directly 

added to asphalt systems in order to efficiently and effectively 
modify the viscosity thereof without the use of either a polar 

activator as a dispersion agent or a preactivation agent.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to thixotropic organoclay additives
designed for highly viscous systems such as asphalt, pitch, tar and
similar formulations. The additive described is an organoclay having
enhanced dispensibility which can be dispersed into such systems without
the use of a polar dispersant or a preactivator.There are in commercial use in the United States, Canada and Europe a
number of organic coating systems utilizing highly viscous, thick coating
compositions. The following paragraphs provide description of these
systems, and a short list of their uses and their peculiar requirements as
to rheology.Asphalt has been utilized in the United States for at least a hundred
years in a wide variety of commercial applications. Such uses include
infrastructure construction uses, most particularly in the design and
development of roads.Asphalt is a brown-to-black-colored bituminous material with a pitchy
luster. It is naturally occurring throughout the world. Approximately
98% of the asphalt used in the United States, however, is derived from oil
by the removal of volatile, lighter-weight components from naturally
occurring petroleum. The typical process separates these components by
evaporation or fractionalization.Asphalt is composed of heterocyclic and other hydrocarbon compounds
containing sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen. Normal asphalt contains
components with molecular weights from about 500 to about 5000. It is
thermoplastic and viscoelastic. Asphalt is highly viscous; that is, at
normal temperature it is of heavy consistency, almost gel-like. In some
cases it is close to being non-fluid. Of growing importance has been the use of special asphalt formulations
designed for the coating of surfaces. These coatings are intended to
protect such surfaces against weather, particularly water and rain, and to
prevent the occurrence of damage such as rust. A major commercial business
has developed in automotive undercoats, where asphalt is used to protect
the under-surface of trucks, construction equipment, military vehicles, and
automobiles from degradation caused by constant exposure to weather, water,
snow and rain, road chemicals, and adverse climate. Almost all such
vehicles in the United States and Canada have had an asphalt treatment
applied to their underbody for these protective purposes.Similar use of asphalt occurs in providing protective coatings for
containers which are used to transport various types of goods and cargo,
particularly over water, or where exposure to the elements of rain and

<CLAIMS>
A composition comprising an asphalt system having
dispersed therein without the addition of a polar

activator an organophilic clay thixotropic agent and
water, which agent comprises: the reaction product of

an organic cation and a smectite-type clay having a
cation exchange capacity of at least 75

milliequivalents per 100 grams of said clay such that
the cation exchange sites of the smectite-type clay are

substituted with the organic cation, and where said
thixotropic agent has been processed in such a manner

to be composed of coarse particles of an average
particle size no smaller than 50 µm (microns), and

wherein said organophilic thixotropic agent is present
in the asphalt system in an amount from 0.1 to 10% by

weight of said system.
The composition of claim 1 wherein the smectite-type

clay is selected from the group consisting of
hectorite and sodium bentonite.
A process for preparing a composition comprising an
asphalt system having dispersed therein without the

addition of a polar activator an organophilic clay
thixotropic agent and water, the process comprising:


(a) preparing a smectite-type clay having a cation
exchange capacity of at least 75 milliequivalents per

100 grams of clay;
(b) adding to the clay an organic cation in an amount
sufficient to satisfy the cation exchange capacity of

the smectite-type clay; 
(c) processing said organophilic clay in such a manner
to produce coarse particles of an average size no

smaller than 50 µm (microns) thereby forming an
organophilic clay thixotropic agent; and
(d) adding said thixotropic agent to the asphalt
system in an amount from 0.1 to 10% by weight in said

system.
A process according to claim 3 wherein the
smectite-type clay is selected from the group

consisting of hectorite and sodium bentonite.
The process of claim 3 or 4 wherein the thixotropic
agent has additionally been dried at a temperature

selected such that the temperature of the thixotropic
agent did not exceed about 60°C during drying.
