<ABSTRACT>
In a photoelectric position measuring device, a light source (1) with striped emission is provided for illuminating a scale (3). The light modulated by the scale (3) is converted into a sinusoidal scanning signal by a scanning plate (2). The scanning plate (2) is a semiconductor substrate with a striped pattern. The width (A) of the light-emitting areas (61) and the width (B) of the intermediate areas (6) of the light source (1) are dimensioned in such a way that certain harmonics are filtered out of the scanning signal. The pattern of the scanning plate (2) is dimensioned in such a way that further harmonics are suppressed.
