<ABSTRACT>
A vacuum processing machine and method are provided for use in 
assembling 

a vacuum insulation panel from a gas impermeable bag and a gas porous 
pouch filled 

with a microporous powder. The machine has a housing (82) which is 
sealable in an air 

tight manner. A pair of substantially parallel plates (84,86) are 
positioned within said housing. 

The housing is openable to receive the bag (68) between the facing front 
sides of the 

plates. A vacuum source (94) communicates with an interior of said 
housing to evacuate 

gases from said bag and pouch. Heat sealing apparatus (100) are 
positioned within the 

housing for sealing an edge of said bag after evacuation of said gases 
from said bag 

and pouch. A nozzle (98) for injecting a trace amount of helium at a 
pressure preferably 

below 1mm Hg into the bag after evacuation of the gases and before 
sealing of the bag may be provided if desired.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a vacuum processing machine and method for 
forming a vacuum insulation panel from a gas impermeable bag and a gas porous 
pouch filled with a microporous powder. Vacuum insulation panels are useful in a variety of environments, and in 
particular in conjunction with refrigeration apparatus in which they are utilized as 
insulating panels in the walls of refrigerators and freezers. Typically a vacuum insulation panel has some type of insulating material, 
generally powders or microporous sheets of insulating material which are placed into a 
non-porous bag and, after evacuation of all gases, the bag is sealed. Such panels 
and a method for fabricating them are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,018,328, 
assigned to Whirlpool Corporation, the assignee of the present application, the 
disclosure of said patent being incorporated herein by reference, as well as in U.S. 
Patent Nos. 5,076,984 and 4,683,702. The use of a gas permeable enclosure to contain the powder during evacuation 
is disclosed in the '984 and '702 patents listed above. The use of multiple 
compartments in an insulation panel is disclosed in the '328 patent. The present invention provides a method for assembling vacuum panels in a 
vacuum processing machine utilizing a significantly improved process over other 
presently known processes.  
 In an embodiment of the invention set forth herein, a vacuum processing 
machine is disclosed which has a housing sealable in an air tight manner. A pair of 
substantially parallel plates are positioned within the housing. The housing is 
openable to receive a gas impermeable bag between the facing front sides of the 
plates. Porous pouches filled with microporous insulating powder are also to be 
inserted within the bag. After the housing is sealed closed, a vacuum is applied to the 
interior of the housing to evacuate gases from the bag and the pouch. A heat sealing 
apparatus is positioned within the housing for sealing an open edge of the bag after 
evacuation of the gases from the bag and the pouch. An optional arrangement allows 
for a nozzle to be positioned within the housing for injecting a very small trace amount 
of helium (preferably under 1mm Hg pressure) into the bag after evacuation of the 
gases and before sealing of the bag. This allows for leak testing of the completed 
insulation panel. FIG. 1 is a flow chart schematically illustrating an embodiment of the method of 
the present invention. FIG. 2 is a flow chart schematically illustrating an embodiment
