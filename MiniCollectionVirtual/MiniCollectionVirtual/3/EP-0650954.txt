<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel lactone-modified diketene
(meth)acrylate compound having an active methylene group in the molecule
and to a process for the preparation thereof.The novel lactone-modified diketene(meth)acrylate compound of the
present invention can be preferably used as resins for coatings, adhesives,
inks, photosensitive materials for photographs, dispersants for pigments,
agents for processing fibers and modifiers for rubbers.The novel lactone-modified diketene(meth)acrylate compound of the
present invention also has a terminated acetylacetonate group in the
molecule.Furthermore, the present invention relates to a novel (co)polymer
which comprises the lactone-modified diketene(meth)acrylate compound and,
optionally, a polymerizable monomer having an ethylenically unsaturated
double bond.Hitherto, an acetoxyethyl methacrylate has been well known as a
(meth)acrylate having a terminated acetylacetonate group in the molecule.The acetoxyethyl methacrylate is represented by the following formula (III); 
US Patent 3,459,790 describes that the above-described compound (III)
can be prepared by the reaction of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate with
diketene, and the compound can be copolymerized with butyl acrylate,
acrylic acid, etc., to obtain an acrylic copolymer having active protons.Furthermore, the US Patent describes that the acrylic copolymer can
be used as a photosensitive material in the photographic field exhibiting
a good dimensional stability and abrasion resistance.On the other hand, US Patent 4,288,511 describes that the acrylic
copolymer can be used in the photographic field as a hydrophilic vehicle
for chelating acid dyes or dyeforming materials to provide a metallized dye
image.Still further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai)
275356/1986 describes that the acrylic copolymer can be used as a photosensitive
resin composition for resist by mixing with a polyacrylic acid,
methyl methacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, and a photo-initiator,
etc., Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (Kokai) 156225/1993 also
describes that the acrylic copolymer can be used as one liquid for a two-liquid
adhesive by mixing with Epikote 828 which is a typical epi-bis epoxy
resin.Although the acetoxyethyl methacrylate represented by the formula
(III) has the property of providing an excellent reactivity as a dispersant
for pigments and inks, etc., it must be further improved in flexibility, 
anti-strippability from a substrate, compatibility with other polymers, and
resistance to
