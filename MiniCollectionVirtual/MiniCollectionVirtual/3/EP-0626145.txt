<ABSTRACT>
An arrangement for stockage of sterile containers or similar is characterised by a guiding device inserted in a cabinet, shelf unit or the like and intended for guiding a basket. This guiding device consists of guiding bolts which define a guiding plane. The basket has guiding grooves running parallel to the guiding plane, so that the guiding grooves are formed at least diagonally to one another in the region of the corners of the basket. The guiding bolts maintain, in the movement direction of the basket, a spacing which is smaller than the length of the basket by approximately the length of the guiding groove.

Arrangement for the storage of containers or the like 
for sterile articles, with a guide device inserted in a 

cupboard, a shelf, or the like for guiding a basket (1), 
characterized in that the guide device is composed of 

guide pins (16 to 19) which define a guide plane, in that 
the basket (1) has guide slots (10,11) extending parallel 

to the guide plane, in that the guide slots (10, 11) are 
formed in the region of the corners of the basket (1) at 

least diagonally relative to one another, and in that the 
spacing of the guide pins (16, to 19) in the direction of 

movement of the basket (1) is smaller than the length (a) 
of the basket (1) by approximately the length of the 

guide slots (10, 11). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that each guide slot (10, 11) is open towards the centre 

of the basket (1). 
Arrangement according to Claim 1 or Claim 2, 
characterized in that each guide slot (10, 11) is defined 

by a hoop (12, 14) or the like extending along the side 
of the basket (1). 
Arrangement according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the guide pins (16 to 19) 

are provided with a guide groove (22). 
Arrangement according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that each guide pin (16 to 19) has a respective 

circumferential guide groove (22).  
 
Arrangement according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the guide pins (16 to 19) 

are welded to a frame or the like. 
Arrangement according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the hoops (12, 14) are provided at the sides of the 

basket (1). 
Arrangement according to at least one of the preceding 
claims, characterized in that the curvature of the groove 

(22) of the guide pins (16, to 19) corresponds 
approximately to the radius of the rods (5, 6) of the 

basket (1) which run on the grooves.
