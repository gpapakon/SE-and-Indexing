<ABSTRACT>
A method of manufacturing a radiation sensor element is disclosed. The 
method includes providing a diamond body which comprises crystalline 

diamond material which has a nitrogen impurity concentration of less 
than 150 ppm. The body is typically a synthetic diamond manufactured 

by a high temperature / high pressure process, or by a chemical vapour 
deposition process. The body is hydrogenated to cause atomic hydrogen 

to be incorporated into the diamond crystal lattice. Hydrogenation can 
be carried out by ion implantation, or by exposing the body to a 

hydrogen plasma. Where the sensor element is to be used as a counting 
diamond, electrical contacts are formed on the body, for example by ion 

implantation.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a method of manufacturing a sensor for
detecting ionising radiation and to a diamond sensor element formed by
the method.It is known to use diamond material in manufacturing radiation sensors.
The performance of such sensors is determined largely by the
concentration of paramagnetic nitrogen, the main impurity in most such
sensors. It has been shown that when the concentration of such
nitrogen decreases to a relatively low value, a dramatic increase in
sensitivity to radiation is observed. However, the usefulness of this
increase in sensitivity is offset to some extent by an increase in the
response time of the sensor, due to an increase in the shallow free-carrier
trapping sites. According to the invention a method of manufacturing a radiation sensor
element comprises the steps of:
providing a diamond body comprising crystalline diamond
material having a nitrogen impurity concentration as determined
by ESR techniques of 150 ppm or less; andhydrogenating the body to cause atomic hydrogen to be
incorporated into the diamond crystal lattice.The diamond material preferably has a nitrogen impurity concentration
of 60 ppm or less, and most preferably less than 10 ppm.The diamond body will typically be selected as having the properties of
a counting diamond or a diamond which is capable of exhibiting
thermoluminescence when subjected to ionising radiation.The diamond body may comprise a synthetic diamond manufactured by
a high temperature/high pressure process, or by a chemical vapour
deposition (CVD) process.Preferably, the diamond body is a single crystal diamond.The diamond body may be hydrogenated by means of an ion
implantation process.In such a process, the ions may be implanted with an energy in the range
1 keV to 1 MeV, preferably 35 keV to 170 keV, and with an ion dose
in the range 1016 ions/cm2 to 1018 ions/cm2. During implantation, the diamond body is preferably maintained at a
temperature in the range 50째C to 300째C.Alternatively, hydrogenation may be carried out by exposing the
diamond body to a hydrogen plasma in a plasma enhanced CVD
process.The method may further include the step of forming at least two spaced
apart electrical contacts on the diamond body.The contacts are preferably formed by implanting suitable ions into
respective contact areas on the surface of the diamond body.A particularly suitable ion for this purpose is carbon.The invention extends to a radiation sensor element formed by the
method.Figure 1  is a graph showing the relationship between
