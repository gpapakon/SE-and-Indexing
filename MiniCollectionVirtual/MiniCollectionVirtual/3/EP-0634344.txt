<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a container for selective collecting of domestic refuse, including a plurality of compartments each closed by a cover (lid) and locking means making it possible to keep said covers individually in a closed position of tilting of the container.   The locking means of at least two covers (8,9) of contiguous compartments (6,7) consist of a blocking piece (12) mounted so as to pivot on the container about an axis which is substantially perpendicular to the plane of the covers (8,9), the said blocking piece being capable of pivoting between a position in which it is above one of the two covers (8) and a position in which it is above the other cover (9).

<CLAIMS>
A container for the selective collection of household refuse, comprising 
a plurality of compartments each closed by a lid, and locking means making 

it possible to keep each of the said lids individually in a closed position 
during the tipping of the container, characterized in that the locking means of 

at least two lids (8, 9) of contiguous compartments (6, 7) are constituted by a 
locking component (12) mounted for pivoting round a pin (13) that is substantially 

perpendicular to the plane of the lids (8, 9), the said locking component 
(12) being capable of pivoting between a position wherein it is situated above 

one of the two lids (8) and a position wherein it is situated above the other lid 
(9). 
A container according to claim 1, characterized in that the locking 
component (12) can also be positioned between the two lids (8, 9). 
A container according to any one of claims 1 and 2, characterized in 
that the locking component (12) takes the form of a handle whereof one end 

(12
a
) is pivotably mounted on the container (1), whilst its other end (12
b
) which 
is free, can be displaced above one or the other of the lids (8, 9) and, if required, 

between the latter. 
A container according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterized in that 
two contiguous lids (8, 9) of the container (1) are articulated on the same hinge 

(10), the corresponding locking component (12) being mounted on the hinge 
(10) for pivoting round a pin (13) that is perpendicular to the axis (10a) of the 

said hinge (10). 
A container according to claim 4, characterized in that it comprises 
two compartments (6, 7) which are separated by a vertical partition (1
a
) situated 
below the common hinge (10) of the lids (8, 9).  

 
A container according to any one of claims 4 and 5, characterized in 
that two paired lids (8, 9) have, in the vicinity of their common hinge (10), a 

flap (14) which extends between the two lids (8, 9) along the hinge (10) and 
below the latter.
