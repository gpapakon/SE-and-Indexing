<DESCRIPTION>
 CATALYTIC REFORMING OF CYCLIC ALKYLENEAMINESThis invention relates to a process of reforming cyclic alkyleneamines to amine- -extended cyclic alkyleneamines. Examples of amine-extended cyclic alkyleneamines include 5 bis(piperazinyl)alkanes, bis-(piperidinyl)alkanes, (aminoalkyl)bis(piperazinyl)alkanes, and higher homologues of these compounds, such astris(piperazinyl)-alkanes and (aminoalkyl)tris- (piperazinyl)alkanes.Amine-extended cyclic alkyleneamines are useful as dispersants, surfactants, chelants, catalysts, curing agents, extenders in polyurethanes, and as starting materials in the ■ o preparation of pesticides.It is known that bis(piperazinyl)alkanes and bis(piperidinyl)alkanes can be prepared by the reaction of an alkyl dihalide with piperazine or piperidine, respectively. The reaction yields the corresponding hydrohalide salts which must be neutralized with base in order to recover the valuable bis(piperazinyl)alkane and bis(piperidinyl)alkane products. 15 Disadvantageously, the neutralization produces a waste stream of metal salt which must be removed.Direct catalytic methods of reforming cyclic alkyleneamines are also known. Typically, direct catalytic methods involving cyclic alkyleneamines tend to yield undesirable products from internal cycli.zation, cracking, and dehydrogenation. For example, U.S. 3,956,329 20 discloses contacting N-(2-aminoethyl)piperazine with a catalyst comprising an aiuminosilicate zeolite of the formula: a(M2/nO)*(AI203) m(Si02) wherein M represents a cation selected from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, zinc group elements, and hydrogen and ammonium cations; "n" represents the valence of the cation, "a" 25 represents 1.0 ± 0.5 regardless of the type and number of the cation, and "m" represents the numbers 2 to 12. Disadvantageously, this process produces large quantities of internal cycliza- tion and cracking products, such as triethylenediamine and piperazine.U.S. 2,474,781 discloses contacting piperazine in the vapor phase at an elevated temperature with a catalyst comprising a Group VB or VIB oxide, such as vanadium oxide or 30 tungsten oxide, supported on alumina. Disadvantageously, the products include large quantities of dehydrogenation products, such as pyrazine.Similarly, the vapor phase deamination of N-(2-aminoethyi)piperazine at 400°C over a kaolin catalyst is reported by A. A. Anderson et al. in Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR, 169 (6), (1966), 1332-1334, to yield cracking products, such as ethylenediamine and piperazine; f<-> 35 dehydrogenation
