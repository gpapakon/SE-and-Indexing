<ABSTRACT>
A golf ball is provided with a cover which is formed 
from a blend of lithium ionomer resin having a flexural modulus 

of at least 60,000 psi and a zinc ionomer resin having a 
flexural modulus within the range of 2800 to 8500 psi.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to golf balls, and, more 
particularly, to a golf ball having a cover which is formed from 
a blend of hard and soft ionomer resins. More particularly, the 
cover is formed from a blend of hard lithium ionomer resin and 
soft zinc ionomer resin. Golf balls which are currently available fall into two 
general categories -- balls which include a balata cover and 
balls which include a more durable, cut-resistant cover. Balata 
covers are made from natural balata, synthetic balata, or a 
blend of natural and synthetic balata. Natural rubber or other 
elastomers may also be included. Synthetic balata is trans 
polyisoprene and is commonly sold under the designation TP-301 
available from Kuraray Isoprene Company Ltd. Most cut-resistant covers utilize Surlyn ionomers, 
which are ionic copolymers available from E.I. du Pont de 
Nemours & Co. Surlyn ionomers are copolymers of olefin, 
typically ethylene, and an alpha-beta ethylenically unsaturated 
carboxylic acid, such as methacrylic acid. Neutralization of a 
number of the acid groups is effected with metal ions, such as 
sodium, zinc, lithium, and magnesium. DuPont's U.S. Patent No. 
3,264,272 describes procedures for manufacturing ionic 
copolymers. Ionic copolymers manufactured in accordance with 
U.S. Patent No. 3,264,272 may have a flexural modulus of from 
about 14,000 to about 100,000 psi as measured in accordance with 
ASTM method D-790. DuPont's U.S. Patent No. 4,690,981 describes 
ionic copolymers which include a softening comonomer. Ionic  
 
copolymers produced in accordance with U.S. Patent No. 4,690,981 
are considered "soft" ionic copolymers and have a flexural 
modulus of about 2800 to about 8500 psi. The disclosures of 
Patent Nos. 3,264,272 and 4,690,981 are incorporated herein by 
reference. Other cut-resistant materials which can be used in golf 
ball covers are ionic copolymers or ionomers available from 
Exxon under the name Iotek, which are similar to Surlyn ionomers 
except that acrylic acid is used rather than methacrylic acid. The ionomer resins generally fall into three categories 
which are characterized by hardness or stiffness -- standard, 
high modulus, and low modulus. The standard resins have a 
flexural modulus in the range of about 30,000 to about 55,000 
psi as measured by ASTM Method D-790. (Standard resins are 
referred to as "hard Surlyns" in U.S. Patent No. 4,884,814.) 
The high modulus resins have a flexural modulus in the range of 
about 55,000 to about 100,000 psi. The low modulus resins have
