<ABSTRACT>
A method for forming a connection element (1) of composite 
material suitable in particular for connecting together tubular 

pieces (4) or parts of a lattice structure, comprising 
continuously winding at least one fibre of the material defining 

the composite material, such as carbon, glass, boron or the like, 
on a sectional support (5) of which the connector (1) is required 

to reproduce the shape, said winding without interruption of 
continuity involving depositing the fibre on each part (7, 8) of 

the support until a layer of the desired thickness has been 
defined, the fibre associated with the support (5) then being 

impregnated with a known binding material, the support (5) and 
everything associated with it then being subjected to pressure and 

polymerization to achieve compacting of the composite material and 
define a one-piece body, said support then being disassembled to 

release the one-piece connection element (1). 
The device for implementing the method comprises a support element 
to which projecting portions are removably fixed, in order to 

define a body reproducing the shape desired for the connection 
element.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method for forming one-piece 
connection elements of composite material or comprising fibres of 
material such as carbon, glass, boron aramid or the like, said elements 
being suitable for use in connecting together parts of a framework 
structure or tubular pieces. Connection elements or connectors of composite material are 
already known. Each connector consists of two shells, each 
comprising one or more composite material fabric layers 
impregnated with usual bonding material (synthetic resin, such as 
epoxy resin, chosen on the basis of the composite material of the 
fabrics). The connector is formed by placing for example the plurality of 
fabrics for each shell in a respective half-mould, then coupling 
the half-moulds together with one or more cores between them, and 
subjecting the assembly to pressure and to heating in an oven to 
achieve mutual adhesion between the fabric layers and 
polymerization of the synthetic resin. On opening the two half-moulds 
the connector is removed, after which the said core or 
cores are extracted from it. This method therefore enables a connector to be obtained which 
however is defined by at least two portions which are physically  
 
separate from each other. This can result in opening of the 
connector if subjected to particularly high torsional bending 
forces of pulse type. This known method can also form connectors in which the two 
portions comprise composite material fabric layers which are not 
perfectly joined together and therefore physically separate from 
each other. Again for this reason, the connectors of the said 
state of the art have a limited capacity to resist localized 
and/or high intensity mechanical forces.  
 GB-A-2.126.300 discloses a method for obtaining a pipe-tee 
by winding resin impregnated glass fibers (in roving form) 
around a T-shaped mandrel to cover the mandrel completely, 
thus obtaining a pipe-tree having a one-piece continuous 
structure. The mandrel is an expendable one, which is 
frangible, soluble, or incorporable but not recoverable and 
reusable. US-A-4,106,797 discloses a recoverable and reusable support 
for obtaining a tee fitting of cured resin and reinforcing 
glass filaments. The known method provides separate 
windings of resin impregnated glass filaments on the 
transverse portion of the tee and on the leg of the tee. 
The resulting structure is not a one-piece continuous 
structure. An object of the present invention is to provide a method 
for forming connectors of composite

<CLAIMS>
A method for forming a one-piece tubular connection element comprising a central part (2) and a laterally extending part (3), the element being of composite 
material or of carbon, glass or boron, 

said element being suitable for use in connecting 
together parts of a framework structure or tubular pieces, 

wherein on a support (5) reproducing the shape of the 
connection element (1) there is laid without interruption 

of continuity at least one layer of untreated composite material, 
and comprising the following succession of treating 

steps: 

a)
 impregnating the material with bonding 
material after its winding on the support (5) to 

obtain an impregnated roughcast, said support being of a plurality of parts (7, 8, 12, 13, 17) separably secured together; 
b)
 enclosing the impregnated roughcast on the 
support (5) in semirigid shells (26) mating the 

outer form of the connection element (1); 
c)
 subjecting the enclosed impregnated roughcast 
first to vacuum and then, in the specified order, to pressure 

and heating to solidify the material, and removing the shells and 
separating into its constituent parts (7, 8, 12, 13, 

17) the support (5); and 
d) removing the support to leave a one-piece tubular connector.
