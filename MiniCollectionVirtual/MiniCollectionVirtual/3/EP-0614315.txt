<ABSTRACT>
A system for processing audio and video components of a 
television signal provides for automatic control of closed caption 

signal display in response to the status (220) of an audio muting 
feature. The system includes an operating mode in which enabling 

audio muting (MUTE ON) also enables the closed caption display 
(250) and disabling muting (MUTE OFF) disables generation of the 

closed caption display (280).

<DESCRIPTION>
From WO 81/02961 an addressable cable television
control system with video format data transmission is known.And EP-A-0 059 666 discloses an entitled apparatus to
display graphic messages transmitted by video text system.The present invention relates to television systems
that include capability for processing auxiliary video information
such as closed caption data. The video signal processing section of
a television system may include capability to decode and display
auxiliary video information such as closed caption data. Closed
caption data includes digital data in the form of ASCII characters
that represent the audio information in a television signal.
Display of closed caption data on a television display is intended
to provide a visible representation of the audio program as an aid
to hearing impaired television viewers. In the United States, the
closed captioning standard is promulgated in Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) regulations (see e.g. 47 CFR §§
15.119 and 73.682). FCC regulations specify that digital closed
caption data is transmitted in line 21 of field 1 in the video signal.
Data representative of two ASCII characters is transmitted in each
occurrence of line 21 in field 1. Future modifications to the
standard may provide for closed caption data to be located in
other lines, e.g. line 21 of every field.Closed caption data is decoded from the video signal
by a decoder. The decoded signal is coupled to the video display
when closed captioning is enabled. Typically, a hearing impaired
viewer enables closed captioning by activating a switch (e.g. on a
remote control or on a control panel of a television) or by selecting
closed captioning from a menu displayed on the video screen
during a control mode of operation. Once activated, closed
captioning remains enabled until disabled by the viewer. A
viewer that is not hearing impaired would tend to disable closed
captioning to avoid having the closed caption display encroach on
the displayed video program. A television system may also include an audio muting
feature in the audio signal processing section. Activating audio
muting causes the audio output from the television to be disabled.
The volume control setting and the displayed video program are
not affected. When audio muting is disabled, the normal audio
output is reestablished without adjustment of the volume control. 
Audio muting may be activated, for example, via remote control,
control panel, or displayed menu features in a manner similar to
the activation of closed

<CLAIMS>
A system for processing a television signal including a video component
and a related audio component corresponding to respective visible and audible portions of

the same television program, said audio portion containing a spoken portion related to
said visible portion of said television program, said video component containing an

auxiliary information component corresponding to a visible representation of said spoken
portion of said television program, said system comprising:


means (100) responsive to said video component for generating a video
output signal (VIDEO) corresponding to said visible portion of said television program;
means (110,120) responsive to said auxiliary information component for
selectively generating an auxiliary information output signal (OSDOUT) corresponding to

said visible representation of said spoken portion of said television program;
switch means (130) for including said auxiliary information output signal,
when generated, in said video output signal for displaying said visible representation of

said spoken portion of said television program together with said related visible portion of
said television program;
means (150) responsive to said audio component for generating an audio
signal (AUDIO) corresponding to said audible portion of said television program;
characterized by:
means (160) for inhibiting said audio signal (AUDIO), when generated,
from being included in an audio output signal (AUDIO OUT) of said system during a predetermined

operating condition of said system; and
means (140) responsive to said predetermined operating condition of said
system for, in a first mode, controlling said switch means (130) to include said auxiliary

information output signal in said video output signal during said predetermined operating
condition, and for, in a second mode, controlling said switch means (130) to exclude said

auxiliary information output signal from said video output signal during said
predetermined operating condition.
The system of claim 1 wherein:

said means (140) responsive to said predetermined operating condition
is responsive to activation by a user for generating a control

signal (MUTE);
said audio output signal inhibiting means (160) is an audio muting circuit
responsive to said control signal for disabling the generation of said audio output signal

during said predetermined operating condition; and 
said auxiliary information output signal generating means (110, 120), in
said first mode, is responsive to said control signal for generating said auxiliary

information output signal when audio muting is enabled and, in said second mode, is not
responsive to said control signal for generating said auxiliary information output signal

when said audio muting is disabled.
The system in claim 2 wherein said auxiliary information output
signal comprises a closed caption signal.
The system recited in claim 1, wherein:

said auxiliary information output signal generating means (110, 120) is
selectively enabled to generate or disabled from generating said auxiliary information

output signal during said predetermined operating condition in response to activation of an
input device by a user (USER INPUT).
