<ABSTRACT>
The connecting parts (3) and a union part are interconnected using a basic part (6) cut from a massive bar profile with units outside a vertically running toothed profile (10) for each support (7). The supports are cut away with a width which is equal to the height of the hollow cross-section of the box profile (2). The connection parts (3) and/or the union part are cut away from the massive bar profile with such a height that in the area of the toothed profile (10) they have at the bottom and top with applied supports (7) approximately the same height. At the top the union part at least tin the area of the toothed profile (10) is inclined in the same angle as the supports (7).

A pyramid-shaped roof truss in which 

a) the hip rafters (2) of the roof truss are box sections 
b) with the lower ends thereof fitting over attachment pieces (7) of joining 
elements (3) arranged at the corners of the pyramid and interconnected 

to form a collar, and 
c) with the upper ends thereof fitting over attachment pieces (26) of a 
connecting element (4) holding the hip rafters (2) together at the tip of 

the pyramid, 
 
characterised in that
 
the joining elements (3) and the connecting element (4) respectively are 

comprised of 

d) a base part (6 and 25), each cut from a solid sectional beam and 
having an indented profile (10) extending vertically along its outer side 

for the attachment piece (7) or for each attachment piece (26), and 
e) the attachment piece or pieces ( 7 and 26) slid with a mating indented 
profile (14) onto the indented profile (10), the attachment piece or 

pieces (7 and 26) being cut from a sectional beam at the angle of inclination 
of the hip rafters (2) with a breadth being substantially 

equal to the height of the hollow cross section of 
the box section (2), the thickness of the sectional beam 

being substantially equal to the width of the hollow 
cross section of the box section (2). 
The roof truss according to claim 1,
 
characterised in that the joining elements (3) and/or the connecting 

element (4) are cut from the solid sectional beam such that the bottom 
and the top of the indented profiles (10) thereof are at least approximately 

flush with the respective adjoining attachment pieces (7 and 26).  
 
The roof truss according to claim 2,
 
characterised in that
 
the connecting element (4), at least at its indented profiles (10), and the 

joining elements (3) in their entirety is or are cut off slantwise at the top 
with the same angle as the attachment pieces (7; 26). 
The roof truss according to claim 2 or 3,
 
characterised in that
 
the connecting element (4) and the joining elements (3) is or are cut off 

at right angles at the bottom. 
The roof truss according to any of claims 1 to 4,
 
characterised in that
 
the indented profile is again provided on the side of the sectional beam 

of the attachment pieces (7; 26) that is opposite the given mating indented 
profile. 
The roof truss according to any of claims 2 to 5,
 
characterised in that
 
the mating indented profile (14) or once more the indented profile is 

again provided on the side of the solid sectional beam of the joining 
elements (3) that is opposite the indented profile (10). 
The roof truss according to claim 6,
 
characterised in that
 
an additional piece cut from the given sectional beam is slid 

onto the latter mating indented profile or indented profile in such a manner 
that the support is enhanced. 
The roof truss according to any of claims 2 to 7,
 
characterised in that
  
 

the solid sectional beam of the joining elements (3) has two wings (8) at 
an angle corresponding to the number of corners of the pyramid, for affixing 

the ties (1) forming the given collar-like connection. 
A construction kit with the sectional beams for cutting the attachment 
pieces (7;26), with the more solid sectional beams for 

cutting the base parts (6;25) and with the box sections for 
the hip rafters (2) given in any of claims 1 to 8. 
The construction kit according to claim 9, with sectional beams for cutting 
the base parts (6; 25) for rectangular, hexagonal and/or octagonal 

pyramids.
