<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a process for 
separating food particles of different specific gravities. 

The process includes providing a feedstock of the food 
particles, providing a feedstock of diatomaceous earth and 

water having a specific gravity effective for particles to 
float or sink; adding the slurry and separating the 

floating food particles from the sinking food particles; 
dewatering the food particles and collecting the water; 

extracting the diatomaceous earth from the slurry and reusing 
the diatomaceous earth in the process.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
separating food pieces in a liquid based upon differences
in specific gravity of the food pieces. In particular, the
present invention relates to a method for separating young
food particles such as peas from mature food particles in
a liquid based upon the starch content of the food
particles.Sweetness is a primary attribute of peas that is of
course of concern to consumers. Pea sweetness depends upon
the sugar content within the pea which is itself a function
of pea maturity. A pea matures when sugars initially
present within the pea are converted to starch for long
term energy storage. In addition to sweetness, the amount
of starch within the pea also affects the texture or
mouthfeel of the pea. Consumers prefer a tender mouthfeel
which translates into a smooth firm texture. As starch
concentration increases within the pea, the pea tends to
take on a rough texture.Pea maturity as measured by starch concentration
has been measured by a wet chemistry test that determines
the percentage of Alcohol Insoluble Solids (AIS) within the
pea. As a pea matures, the amount of the alcohol insoluble 
solids within the pea increases while the amount of alcohol
soluble solids decreases. AIS percentages may be
correlated with the percentage of starch within the peas.
For example, early peas which are usually high in sugar
content have low starch concentrations and therefore have
a low AIS percentage, whereas mature peas picked later in
the season have high starch concentrations and therefore
have a high AIS percentage.An accepted procedure for the calculation of AIS is
designated as "Solids (Alcohol-Insoluble) in Frozen Peas,
Gravimetric Method", 32.065 of the Association of Official
Chemists of the U.S.A. In addition to the AIS test, an
instrument known as a Tenderometer, available from the FMC
Corporation of Summit, Illinois, U.S.A. can be used to
provide an initial rough estimation of the quality of a
batch of peas based upon the relative tenderness of the
peas.As sugar is converted by the peas into starch, the
specific gravity of the peas increases since starch in situ
is a more dense compound than sugar. Because of this
difference in specific gravity, mature peas have been
separated from young, high sugar peas by formulating a
brine solution of intermediate specific gravity calculated
from data obtained by the AIS test and the use of the
Tenderometer. The peas are dispersed into the static brine
solution and the more mature peas with a high starch
concentration and
