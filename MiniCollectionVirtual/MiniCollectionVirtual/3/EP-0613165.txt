<ABSTRACT>
A discharge chamber wherein incomplete discharge 
arising from a discharge electrode surface condition is 

suppressed and a manufacturing method for the discharge 
chamber are disclosed. The discharge chamber includes a 

first substrate, a plurality of discharge electrodes 
formed on a surface of the first substrate by printing 

and baking, a second substrate adhered to the first 
substrate with a predetermined gap left therebetween, 

and ionizable gas enclosed in the gap. The discharge 
electrodes have clean surfaces from which insulating 

substances have been removed, and have a uniform 
composition in a horizontal direction and a depthwise 

direction. A plurality of barrier ribs are formed 
between the first and second substrates by printing and 

baking such that they overlap partially with the 
discharge electrodes. Insulating substances which make 

an obstacle to plasma discharge have been removed from 
exposed portions of the discharge electrodes at which 

the discharge electrodes are not covered with the 
barrier ribs.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a discharge chamber 
incorporated in a plasma addressed liquid crystal 
display device or a like device, and more particularly 
to a surface treatment technique for discharge 
electrodes of a discharge chamber. A plasma addressed liquid crystal display device 
in which a discharge chamber is used for addressing of a 
liquid crystal cell is already known and disclosed, for 
example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,896,149 and Japanese 
Patent Laid-Open Application No. Heisei 1-217396 which 
corresponds to U.S. Patent No. 5,077,553. Referring to 
FIG. 4, the plasma addressed liquid crystal display 
device shown has a layered flat panel structure which 
includes a liquid crystal cell 101, a discharge chamber 
102 and a common intermediate substrate 103 interposed 
between the liquid crystal cell 101 and the discharge 
chamber 102. The discharge chamber 102 is formed using 
a glass substrate 104 and has a plurality of striped  
 
grooves 105 formed on a surface thereof. The grooves 
105 extend, for example, in the direction along a row of 
a matrix. The grooves 105 are individually closed up by 
the intermediate substrate 103 to define spaces 106 
which are individually separate from each other. 
Ionizable gas is enclosed in the thus closed up spaces 
106. A rib 107 of the glass substrate 104 is disposed 
between each adjacent ones of the grooves 105 and serves 
as a barrier rib for isolating the adjacent spaces 106 
from each other. A pair of parallel discharge 
electrodes are provided on a curved bottom surface of 
each of the grooves 105 and function as an anode A and a 
cathode K to ionize the gas in the corresponding space 
106 to produce discharge plasma. Such discharge area 
makes a row scanning unit. Meanwhile, the liquid 
crystal cell 101 is constructed using a transparent 
substrate 108. The substrate 108 is disposed in an 
opposing relationship to the intermediate sheet 103 with 
a predetermined gap left therebetween, and a liquid 
crystal layer 109 is filled in the gap. A plurality of 
signal electrodes 110 are formed on an inner surface of 
the substrate 108. The signal electrodes 110 extend 
perpendicularly to the striped spaces 106 and make 
column driving units. Picture elements in a matrix are  
 
defined at intersecting positions between the column 
driving units and the row scanning units. In the 
display device having such a construction as described 
above, the striped spaces 106 in which plasma discharge 
occurs are selectively scanned in a line sequential 
condition
