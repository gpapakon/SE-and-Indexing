<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a pneumatic tool (1) 
having superior sound muffling performance. The 

pneumatic tool has an exhaust port (3), wherein a sound 
muffling structure (4) comprising a nonwoven web of fibers (5) 

coated with a binder resin, is fitted in said exhaust 
port to seal said exhaust port, wherein said fibers 

have diameters of about 30 to about 100 microns and 
wherein the web has a compression resistance energy of 

about 0.09 to about 0.14 Joules.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a pneumatic tool having
an improved sound muffling structure contained therein.Pneumatic tools, or air driven tools are known and
commonly employed in many industrial and residential
uses. Various types of pneumatic tools include air
hammers, ratchets, drills, wrenches, and the like. The
tools typically include a chamber in the housing of the
tool that is adapted to receive compressed air from an
air line. The air flows through the chamber to an air
motor which drives the tool, and excess air flows back
through an exhaust port in the tool. As the air is
vented through the exhaust port, a considerable amount
of noise is generated which could cause auditory damage
to anyone within the vicinity of the operating tool.
There is evidence that indicates that hearing loss will
occur at exposure to an eight hour time weighted
average noise level above 90 decibels (dBA).There is a desire, and a regulated need, in
industry to lower the noise level of pneumatic tools
down to 85 dBA or lower. Noise or sound is typically
measured on a decibel system which is logarithmic. A
3 dBA difference in noise level represents a difference
in the sound energy output of the tool by a factor of
about two. A 10 dBA increase shows an increase of ten
times the sound energy. As a protective mechanism, the
human ear perceives a 10 dBA increase in sound as being
twice as loud. Noise levels about 95dBA can be
painful. Noise levels in a "quiet" room, i.e., a room 
with no machines running, are typically in the range of
50-65 decibels.Although protective ear plugs can be available to
workers, they are often not used for any number of
reasons - i.e., they are inconvenient to use, they get
lost, workers don't want the bother of using them, etc.
They also represent an economic liability which could
be avoided by preventive measures such as quieting the
tool.Numerous attempts have been made to suppress the
noise generated by air tools; these include modifying
the housing and exhaust ports of the tools to diffuse
the sound energy before the air is exhausted, and
putting various types of mufflers in or around the
exhaust port.For example, U. S. Patent No. 3,896,897 describes
a muffler assembly with apertures that are wrapped
around the exhaust port of the tool. The muffler
assembly is described as having three layers - an
impregnated fabric laminated to a sheet of lead or non-resonating
metal, and a porous sheet material.U. S. Patent No. 5,189,267 describes an air tool
muffler system having a foraminous material located
