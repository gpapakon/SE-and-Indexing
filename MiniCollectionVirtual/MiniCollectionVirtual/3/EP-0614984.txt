<ABSTRACT>
Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which bind to human 
TNFα. Autoantibodies of both the IgM and IgG isotypes are 

disclosed. A preferred human monoclonal antibody is known 
as B5 (F78-1A10-B5 mAb) and it binds to recombinant human 

TNFα (rhTNFα) in ELISA format with a titer comparable to 
three high affinity neutralizing mouse mAbs. It also binds 

to cell surface TNFα and prevents TNFα secretion by human 
monocyte cell lines.

<DESCRIPTION>
Field: This disclosure relates generally to monoclonal
antibodies and specifically with human monoclonal antibodies that bind
to human tumor necrosis factor (TNFα).Prior Art: TNFα is a pluripotent and pleiotropic cytokine.
It is produced principally by activated macrophages, however
its synthesis and secretion have also been observed using
granulocytes, tonsil B cells, B cell lines, natural killer
cells, T cell lines, primary chronic malignant B cell
isolates, and peripheral blood T cells.TNFα can also be expressed on cell surfaces, apparently
in two forms. One is a 26 kd molecular weight integral type
2 transmembrane protein on monocytes, T cells and some other
cells. The other form is the secreted 17 kd product which
is bound to its receptor.Among the many activities of secreted TNFα are
thymocyte growth factor, B cell growth and maturation
factor, production invivo of hemorrhagic necrosis, weight
loss, cardiovascular collapse and multiple organ failure.
Naturally, these latter activities are the source of the
clinical interest in TNFα.During septic shock, as well as inflammatory diseases,
synthesis and secretion of TNFα, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 have
been documented. Hence the immune systems of some
individuals are exposed chronically to these cytokines.
Indeed, low affinity antibodies to TNFα have been reported
(A. Fomsgaard et al "Auto-antibodies to Tumor Necrosis
Factor α in Healthy Humans and Patients with Inflammatory 
Diseases and Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections." Scand. J.
Immunol. 30:219-23, 1989; and, K. Bendtzen et al "Auto-antibodies
to IL-1α and TNFα in Normal Individuals and
Infectious and Immunoinflammatory Disorders." Prog.
Leukocyte. Biol. 10B:447-52, 1990). These anti-TNFα
autoantibodies may, however, not be specific (H.-G. Leusch
et al "Failure to Demonstrate TNFα Specific Autoantibodies
in Human Sera by ELISA and Western Blot." J. Immunol. Meth.
139:145-147, 1991).One peculiar feature of human serum, as well as sera
from other animals, is its content of natural and so-called
polyreactive antibodies. These are usually IgM antibodies
which bind to various autoantigens with low affinity (A.B.
Hartman et al "Organ Reactive Autoantibodies from Non-Immunized
Adult Balb/c Mice are Polyreactive and Express
Non-Biased Vh Gene Usage." Molec. Immunol. 26:359-70, 1989;
and, P. Casali et al "CD5+ B Lymphocytes, Polyreactive
Antibodies and the Human B cell Repertoire." Immunol.
Today. 10:364-8, 1989). Hence the autoantibody-like
reactivity to human TNFα might be expected to be low
affinity and
