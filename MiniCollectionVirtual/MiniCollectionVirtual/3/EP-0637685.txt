<ABSTRACT>
According to the invention, in a fuel-injected engine for which the basic period of injection is defined as a function of a shift and of a gain of a straight line expressing this period as a function of the pressure in the pipe, for a given speed and load condition, auto-adaptation is prevented by modifying the gain or the shift simultaneously when the purge valve of the canister is delivering, and auto-adaptation is allowed respectively in shift or in gain during at most a maximum number of n1 or n2 cycles, in an operating range 1 at low pressure, or respectively 2 at high pressure, the purge valve is allowed to deliver only after the maximum number of n1 or respectively n2 cycles has been accomplished, and a further auto-adaptation in gain and likewise in shift is permitted only after all the permitted cycles in gain and in shift have been accomplished.   Application to fuel-injected engines with a canister purge circuit and auto-adaptation of the mixture richness on the basis of a  lambda  probe in the exhaust gases.

Process for auto-adaptation of the air/fuel ratio 
and permitting the purging of a purge circuit of an injection 

engine (1), for which the purge circuit comprises a 
canister (16) collecting fuel vapours coming from a tank 

(11) and connected to an inlet duct (4) of the engine (1) 
provided with an air valve or butterfly (5) for controlling 

the air flow, by means of an electrically controlled valve 
(20) of the canister (16), the flow through which is 

controlled by a computer (21) connected to sensors (26, 28) 
for the operating parameters of the engine (1) of which it 

receives at least signals (30) of rotation of the engine and 
signals (27, 30, 31) allowing the pressure (P tub) in the 

inlet duct (4) to be known, and an oxygen sensor in the 
exhaust gas of the engine, said computer (21) calculating an 

injection duration, transmitted to at least one injector (2) 
and obtained from a base injection duration (T inj B) 

expressed, in the case of a given engine regime (N), as a 
substantially linear crescent function of the pressure in 

the duct (P tub) with a shift (D) at the origin and an 
increase (G) which are drawn from maps as a function of at 

least the engine regime (N), and corrected taking into 
consideration a coefficient of the air/fuel ratio (KO2) 

determined as a function of the air/fuel ratio signal of the 
oxygen sensor (32) in the operating areas of the engine (1) 

in a closed loop and fixed equal to a nominal value in the 
operating areas of the engine (1) as an open loop, to ensure 

the setting of the operation of the engine at an air/fuel 
ratio equal to 1, the shift (D) and the increase (G) 

furthermore being the object of a cyclical auto-adaptation 
to ensure that the coefficient of the air/fuel ratio (KO2) 

remains close to its nominal value, by a correction of any 
drift of this coefficient of the air/fuel ratio (KO2) in at 

least one first phase of operation of the engine, at low  
 

pressure of the duct (P1, P2) by modification of at least 
the shift (D) and in at least a second range of operation of 

the motor, at high pressure of the duct (P3, P4) by modification 
of at least the increase (G),
 
characterised in that it consists in : 


preventing simultaneous auto-adaptation and flow 
through the purge valve (20), 
permitting, at each entry to an auto-adaptation 
phase, this phase for at most a maximum number of n1 cycles, 

in the first phase of operation, and for at most a maximum 
number of n2 cycles in the second phase of operation, 
in not permetting the flow through the purge valve 
(20) until a certain maximum number of auto-adaptation 

cycles, n1 or n2 respectively, have been performed, and 
in not permetting a new auto-adaptation in shift 
(D) or in increase (G) until after all the permitted auto-adaptation 

shift and increase cycles have been performed. 
Process according to Claim 1, characterised in that 
it consists in only adapting the shift (D) or, respectively, 

the increase (G) for the auto-adaptation cycles performed 
only in the first or second ran
ge of operation of the engine 
respectively. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that it consists in selecting the 

maximum numbers of nl and n2 auto-adaptation cycles to be 
equal to, respectively, 2 and 1. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that it consists in not preventing 

the flow through the purge valve (20), irrespective of the 
auto-adaptation conditions, in the range (P2-P3) of operation 

of the engine which extends between said first and 
second ranges. 
Process according to any one of the preceding 
Claims, characterised in that it consists in preventing, at 

the entry of the engine into an idle phase, the flow through 
the purge valve (20), in substituting, for the auto-adaptation  

 
in shift (D), a cyclical auto-adaptation in idle shift 

(DR) which is interrupted as soon as the value of the idle 
shift (DR) after a given cycle is sufficiently close to that 

obtained after the preceding cycle, and in permitting, 
subsequently, the flow through the purge valve (20). 
Process according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
it consists, at each entry into the phase of auto-adaptation 

in idle shift (DR), in permitting this for, at most, a 
maximum number of n3 cycles. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterised in that 
it consists in repeating, cyclically, the auto-adaptation in 

idle shift (DR) until a constant value of idle shift has 
been obtained. 
Process according to any one of Claims 5 to 7, 
characterised in that it consists in restricting the range 

of operation in idle to an upper engine regime threshold 
which is less than or equal to a lower engine regime 

threshold (N1) for the first and second ranges of operation 
corresponding to the auto-adaptation in shift (D) and, 

respectively, in increase (G). 
Device for auto-adaptation of the air/fuel ratio and 
permitting a purging of a purge circuit (16, 17, 19, 20)

a computer (21) connected to sensors (26, 28) for operating 

parameters of the engine (1) and to a sensor for the oxygen 
in the exhaust gas of the engine (1), and controlling an 

electrically-controlled valve (20) connecting the canister 
(16) to an inlet duct (4) provided with an air valve (5) 

controlling the air flow, said computer (21) calculating an 
injection duration, applied to at least an injector (2) or 

the motor (1) and obtained from a base injection duration 
(T inj B) expressed as a function of the pressure in the 

inlet duct (4) with a shift (D) at the origin and an 
increase (G) drawn from maps in the memory in the computer 

(21), and corrected using a coefficient of the air/fuel 
ratio (KO2) determined by the computer (21) as a function of  

 
the air/fuel ratio signal (R) of the oxygen sensor in 

operation in a closed loop and equal to a nominal value in 
operation in an open loop, to ensure the setting of the 

operation of the engine (1) at an air/fuel ratio equal to 1,
