<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), and more particularly, to
a UAV having an optimized toroidal fuselage
structure (shroud) and a pair of coaxial, counter-rotating,
ducted, multi-bladed rotors.There has been a recent resurgence in the
interest in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for
performing a variety of missions where the use of
manned flight vehicles is not deemed appropriate,
for whatever reason. Such missions include
surveillance, reconnaissance, target acquisition
and/or designation, data acquisition,
communications datalinking, decoy, jamming,
harassment, or one-way supply flights. This
interest has focused mainly on UAVs having the
archetypical airplane configuration, i.e., a
fuselage, wings having horizontally mounted engines
for translational flight, and an empennage, as
opposed to "rotor-type" UAVs, for several reasons.First, the design, fabrication, and operation
of "winged" UAVs is but an extrapolation of the
manned vehicle flight art, and therefore, may be
accomplished in a relatively straightforward and
cost effective manner. In particular, the
aerodynamic characteristics of such UAVs are well 
documented such that the pilotage (flight
operation) of such vehicles, whether by remote
communications datalinking of commands to the UAV
and/or software programming of an on-board flight
computer, is relatively simple.In addition, the range and speed of such UAVs
is generally superior to rotor-type UAVs.
Moreover, the weight-carrying capacity of such UAVs
is generally greater that rotor-type UAVs such that
winged UAVs may carry a larger mission payload
and/or a larger fuel supply, thereby increasing the
vehicle's mission efficiency. These
characteristics make winged UAVs more suitable than
rotor-type UAVs for certain mission profiles
involving endurance, distance, and load capability.
Winged UAVs, however, have one glaring deficiency
that severely limits their utility.More specifically, winged UAVs do not have a
fixed spatial point "loiter" capability. For
optimal performance of many of the typical mission
profiles described hereinabove, it is desirable
that the UAV have the capability to maintain a
fixed spatial frame of reference with respect to
static ground points for extended periods of time,
e.g., target acquisition. One skilled in the art
will appreciate that the flight characteristics of
winged UAVs are such that winged UAVs cannot
maintain a fixed spatial frame of reference with
respect to static ground points, i.e., loiter.
Therefore, mission equipment for
