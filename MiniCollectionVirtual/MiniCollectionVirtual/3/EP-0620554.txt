<ABSTRACT>
A tape cartridge is arranged so that when an 
upper lid of a pocket portion of the tape cartridge is in 

a position for opening the upper side of the pocket 
portion, the upper lid is positioned above an upper 

surface of a casing body so that a lower surface of the 
upper lid faces the upper surface of the casing body 

through a gap in which a member of a recording/reproduction 
apparatus for depressing the cartridge can 

be placed. When the upper lid is in the position for 
opening the upper side of the pocket, the cartridge 

depressing member of the recording/reproduction apparatus 
is placed in the gap to depress the cartridge, whereby 

the cartridge can be stably depressed to and mounted in a 
predetermined position in the recording/reproduction 

apparatus when the cartridge is loaded in the apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a tape cartridge and to a system comprising a tape
cartridge and a recording/reproducing apparatus for the tape cartridge and, more
particularly, to a small-scale tape cartridge having a two-lids structure in which a
pocket or mouth portion, for receiving a head of the recording/reproducing
apparatus upon loading of the cartridge in the recording/reproducing apparatus, is
formed in a front portion of a casing body of the tape cartridge, and in which a
tape of the tape cartridge extending across the pocket portion is covered with the
two or three lids when the cartridge is not loaded.With respect to tape cartridges described in this description, "front (side)" denotes
a side of the tape cartridge facing the head, "upper (side)" denotes a side of the
cartridge where the lids are positioned when opened, "transverse (end)", "side"
and "left and/or right" correspond to (end) portion or portions of the pocket
portion located oppositely in the lengthwise direction of the tape extending in the
pocket portion.A double-lid or two-lids structure of tape cartridges of this kind. e.g., an 8 mm
video tape cartridge shown in Fig. 9, is known which has a front 
lid 202 capable of opening and closing a front side of a
pocket 201, and an inner lid or back or rear lid 205
capable of opening and closing a non-magnetic surface
side of a magnetic tape 204 by moving along guide grooves
203 in side walls of the pocket 201. See Japanese Patent
Unexamined Publication Nos. 58-128069, 61-210585 and 61-210587,
for example.Further, in order to reduce the size of a
recording/reproduction mechanism or apparatus for such a
tape cartridge, a cylinder/cartridge overlapping system
is well known in which, as shown in Fig. 10, a
cylindrical head or cylinder with the read/write head 206
of the recording/reproduction apparatus enters the pocket
201 of the cartridge at the time of cartridge loading.
See, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication
Nos. 60-163264 and 60-171684.In this structure, if the cylinder (cylinder
drum) 206 is introduced deep into the pocket of the 8 mm
video cartridge to an excessively large extent, there is
a possibility that the cylinder 206 may interface with a
part of the inner or back lid 205, for opening/closing
the non-magnetic face side of the tape 204, as shown in
Fig. 10.Recently, various technologies have been
developed to meet a demand for magnetic recording/reproduction
apparatuses such as video cameras (VTRs,
i.e., video tape recorders and/or players) smaller in 
size and

<CLAIMS>
A tape cartridge comprising:

a casing body (1, 209) having in a front portion thereof a pocket (7, 201);
a front lid (28, 202) movably attached to said casing body (1, 209) so as to open
and close a front side of the pocket (7, 201); and
an upper lid (29, 250) movably attached to said casing body (1, 209) so as to
open and close the upper side of the pocket (7, 201);
characterized in that
