<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a biocidal agent and in particular to an agent 
which is antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral. To date, the agent of the 
invention is being used to treat a wide variety of diseases in animals and 
humans - both internally and externally, in a localised or systemic 
manner. However, it is thought that the invention has particular application 
in the treatment of viruses and particularly, but not exclusively, equine 
viruses. This is mainly because there are few effective anti-viral agents on 
the market especially the equine market and there is therefore a need to 
provide a suitable anti-viral product. The advantages of providing a suitable equine anti-viral product are 
apparent when one considers that a racehorse can cost millions of pounds 
and once infected with a virus it is temporarily unable to compete and thus 
bring about any return for money invested in the horse. At worst, viral 
infections can result in a fatality. It is also of note that the agent in accordance with the invention is suitable 
for treating human viral conditions such as Herpes. Further, the agent in accordance with the invention has also been used for 
treating a wide variety of conditions of a non-viral nature, for example, 
cuts, ulcers or burns.  
 The agent of the invention is a natural remedy in that it comprises the 
combination of known and harmless products, which products have either 
been consumed by or used by man for centuries. It was found that a 
combination of these products produced an agent which had unexpected 
anti-viral properties. Further, the agent also had unexpected efficacy 
when treating non-viral ailments. In this latter instance, it is thought that 
the selection of the components of the agent produced an agent having 
enhanced or synergistic effects thus providing a single agent which is 
particularly successful for treating non-viral ailments. The agent in accordance with the invention is a biocidal agent which 
comprises a mixture of an alkaline substance and a botanical extract from 
the Cruciferous herbs commonly known as mustard seed producing 
plants. In an ideal form of the invention the agent further comprises a sweetening 
substance which ideally is honey. The agent of the invention thus comprises at least two and ideally three 
components. Each of these components are known to man and indeed are 
known to have beneficial medicinal properties. These agents and their 
properties will now be reviewed. The preferred alkaline substance of the invention is a
