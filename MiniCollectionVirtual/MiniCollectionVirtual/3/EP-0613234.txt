<ABSTRACT>
A dynamoelectric machine includes a rotor, a direct 
current bus, and only two power transistors (166,168) connected in series 

across the bus. A winding (170) is connected at one end between the 
switches and is connected at the other end at a center-tap of 

two power capacitors (162,164) connected in series across the bus. The 
position of the rotor is sensed by a Hall device (182) and the speed 

or torque of the motor is controlled by selectively gating the 
switches to apply current through the winding so that the 

windings generate a magnetic field for rotating the rotor at a 
desired speed or torque. A voltage doubler, Cuk dc/dc 

converter, or other regulating device may be used to power the 
motor. The stator may have removable asymmetric teeth tips to 

permit efficient winding and avoid the motor parking at a zero 
torque starting position.

<DESCRIPTION>
An electronically commutated motor (ECM) is a motor
having permanent magnets mounted on the rotor. The stator of
the motor contains wire-wound coils, which when energized with
current, interact with the permanent magnet rotor to produce
positive or negative torque, depending on the direction of the
current with respect to the polarity of the magnets. The
polarity of the magnets with respect to the stator coil
alternate when the rotor moves unidirectionally, so to
maintain a constant direction of torque, it is necessary to
alternate the direction of the stator current in synchronism.
The energization of the stator is controlled by a transistor
inverter having the sophistication to ultimately control the
direction of torque, the amount of torque, and the shaft speed.The stator coils are organized into groupings called
phases, each phase being excited with similar, but phase-shifted,
alternating currents. Three-phase stators are the
most common. Single-phase stators obtain cost-savings by
component reduction in the inverter but a single-phase machine
can be more difficult to start from rest.The conventional ac to dc input for an ECM inverter
is a diode rectifier. This circuit has three major disadvantages:
lack of control of the dc voltage down to zero, input
harmonic currents, and low ac power factor. Several approaches
using a pulse width modulated (PWM) ac to dc converter provide
low input harmonic currents and unity power factor. However,
they step-up the input ac voltage from its diode rectified
value.An approach to gating circuitry in the prior art
would be the use of small isolation transformers. When gating
action is desired, an alternating voltage, typically a square 
wave of logic-supply voltage levels, is applied to the primary
of the small transformer, and the output of the transformer
secondary is then rectified and supplied to the power switch
gate. The voltage level shifting is maintained by the dielec
tric between the transformer primary and secondary windings.High voltage IC's perform gating action for bridge
inverters (such as the International Rectifier IR2110), but
they require that the lower of the two gating voltages be only
one threshold voltage above ground. In this ECM drive circuit,
one of the gating voltages is significantly below ground.DE-A-3314300 discloses a converter comprising a
direct current bus, means for dividing the voltage
provided by the direct current bus, two switches
connected in series across the direct current bus and
winding having one end connected between the
