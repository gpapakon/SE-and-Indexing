<ABSTRACT>
A color electrophotographic apparatus using a plurality 
of image forming units (31Bk,31Y,31M,31C). 

The entire image forming unit group 
moves by rotation, and a toner image is transferred on an 

intermediate transfer belt (49) at an image forming position. 
The intermediate transfer belt (49) is variable in speed, and 

while the image forming unit group is moving, it is stopped 
or runs at low speed. The hopper in the 

image forming unit (31Bk,31Y,31M,31C) 
is divided into two sections. The toner is supplied to the 

image forming position, and when the toner remainder sensor 
detects no remaining toner, the image forming unit group 

rotates by one revolution or more, and then the toner 
remainder is detected again to judge presence or absence of 

toner remainder. At this time, the toner in the toner hopper 
is agitated by the agitating member. 

After rotary move of the image forming unit 
group, each image forming unit is initialized sequentially. 

The side walls of the signal light optical path are composed 
of image forming units, and the color of the side walls is 

black. The gap between two adjacent signal forming units is 
20 mm or less. One erase lamp of the photosensitive 

member is provided near the image forming position. 
During rotary motion of the image forming unit group, it is 

controlled so as not to disturb the toner image on the 
intermediate transfer belt (49).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a color
electrophotographic apparatus applicable in color printer,
color copier, color facsimile apparatus or the like.Generally, to form a color image by electrophotography,
color toner images of yellow, magenta, cyan and black are
overlaid on a transfer member, and a color image is
composed. One of such color image forming methods is the
transfer drum method, in which color toner images are
sequentially formed on one photosensitive member, and a
transfer member wound on the transfer drum is repeatedly
set opposite to the photosensitive member, and the color
toner images formed thereon are overlaid and transferred.
Other known method is the continuous overlay method, in
which plural image forming parts are set sequentially, and the
transfer member conveyed by a belt passes the transfer
position of the image forming parts to overlay the color
toner images. An example of employing the former transfer drum method
is a color image forming apparatus disclosed in the Japanese
Laid-open Patent No. 1-252982. Fig. 1 shows a general
structural outline of this prior art. Its constitution and
operation are briefly described below. In Fig. 1, reference
numeral 1 denotes a photosensitive member, 2 is a charger,
3 is a developing device, 4 is a transfer drum, and 5 is a
cleaner. The developing device 3 consists of a Y developing
unit 6 for making a yellow color toner image, an M
developing unit 7 for magenta color, a C developing unit 8
for cyan color, and Bk developing unit 9 for black color.
The entire body of the developing device 3 rotates, and each
developing unit sequentially confronts the photosensitive
member 1 to be ready to develop. Each developing unit has
a toner hopper 10 to be refilled with toner from outside,
and a color toner corresponding to each developing unit is
supplied from each hopper. The toner concentration is
detected by optical detecting means, on a developing roller
at the developing position, and the toner is supplied from a
position moved 90 degrees from the developing position. In
monochromatic continuous mode, when the toner concentration
is lowered, the entire developing device rotates, and the
toner is supplied at the toner supply position. The toner
fed from the hopper 10 is conveyed in a pipe (not shown).
The pipe is supplied from the toner refill port (not shown) 
provided in part of the central shaft through the rotation
central shaft of the rotary developing apparatus into the
developing unit by gravity. The toner supplied in each
developing unit
