<ABSTRACT>
The optical tape recorder of the present invention is capable of archiving data at rates in excess of 400 megabits per second by concurrently writing or reading a plurality of data tracks in each data trace. A read-write module (102) outputs an illumination beam (104) comprised of combined multiple write beams (channels), a read beam and an autofocus beam. Optics within the read-write module spatially combine and accurately position the plurality of beams with respect to each other to form the multi-beam illumination beam (104). A read-write head (106) comprised of a synchronized scanning transmissive polygon (110) and rotating lens wheel (112) scans the multi-beam illumination beam (104) across a recording media (108) to read or write multi-channel data tracks. An autofocus system is also included to ensure that the multi-beam illumination beam (104) is accurately focused on the recording media (108).

<DESCRIPTION>
 HIGH DATA RATE OPTICAL TAPE RECORDERTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to optical tape recorders and, in particular, to an optical tape recorder for archiving and retrieving data at rates in excess of 400 megabits per second. 
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONMagnetic tape recording systems are widely used to archive digital information, but have historically been plagued by performance and storage problems that render their continued use for high volume information storage unacceptable. For example, due to the relatively low storage density of the magnetic recording media, a large number of expensive tape reels or cassettes are required to store the information. Furthermore, the mechanical devices and parts used in providing a storage system for the reels and cassettes of recorded media often require expensive and time consuming maintenance and/or complete replacement. The magnetic tapes must also be repacked every six months to account for tape stretch and rerecorded every five to ten years in order to preserve data integrity.Optical systems are now commonly used in place of magnetic systems for recording and playback of digitized information. In optical recorders, the data is used to amplitude modulate a light beam having a predetermined intensity necessary to mark a light sensitive recording media. The modulated beam is focused to a smail spot and traced across the media to record the data as a fine optical pattern comprised of a number of closely spaced, microscopic dots (data marks) along a data track. To recover the recorded data from the optical media, a low 

intensity illumination beam is scanned along the data track and modulated by the optical pattern recorded therein. The modulated beam is reflected from the media to illuminate a light detector producing an electrical signal in accordance with the beam modulation for recovery of the recorded data. Optical recording and playback systems have proven to provide enhanced performance characteristics over magnetic systems. The microscopic optical pattern of data recorded on the recording media by an optical system dramatically increases the data storage density over conventional magnetic systems. Furthermore, there is a decreased susceptibility to tape stretch and wear with optical playback systems because, unlike magnetic systems, there is active optical tracking during the reading process with no contact between the read head and the media. Accordingly, data life on the media is increased to over twenty years. Finally, because
