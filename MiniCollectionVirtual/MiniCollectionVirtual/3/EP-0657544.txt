<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to a method for the production 
of (2R,3S)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)glycidic acids and esters 

thereof, which are synthetic intermediate for the production 
of the calcium antagonist diltiazem. The method involves the 

stereoselective enzymatic ester hydrolysis of racemic trans-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)glycidic 
acid ester to yield the resolved 

(2R,3S) compound as the ester. Membrane reactor methods and 
apparatus for the conduct of this enzymatic resolution 

process are also disclosed herein, as is the use of bisulfite 

anion in the aqueous reaction phase as a means of minimizing 
the inhibitory effect of an aldehyde reaction by-product on 

the reaction's progress. The benefits of selected solvent 
systems from which may be obtained highly resolved ester 

product are also disclosed. These enriched organic solutions 
may be used in subsequent transformations. Alternatively, 

optically pure product may be obtained directly therefrom.

<DESCRIPTION>
The esters of trans-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)glycidic acid 
have utility as precursors in the chemical synthesis of 
diltiazem. Moreover, these compounds present a very 
attractive point in the overall synthetic route to diltiazem 
at which to introduce the desired stereochemistry into the 
diltiazem precursors through resolution of the racemic 
glycidic esters and use of the correct, optically purified 
precursor ester. The present invention pertains to a novel 
enzymatic method for resolving a racemic mixture of esters of 
the (2R,3S)- and (2S,3R)-enantiomers of trans-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)glycidic 
acid. It also pertains to a process 
for diltiazem production incorporating this resolution step 
and to membrane reactor means for improving the efficiency of 
enzymatic resolution of this diltiazem intermediate. The 
amelioration of the effects of an inhibitory aldehyde byproduct 
of the reaction process by means of its formation of 
an adduct with an agent provided in the aqueous reaction 
phase is also an aspect of the present invention. Moreover, 
selected organic solutions of the optically active glycidic 
ester intermediates have been developed which are 
particularly useful in subsequent processes involving the  
 
isolation of the intermediate directly from the solution or 
use of the solution to introduce a new reagent for a further 
chemical transformation. Diltiazem, the chemical structure of which is shown in 
Figure 1, is an optically active pharmaceutical compound. 
More specifically, diltiazem, the chemical name of which is 
(+)-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-cis-2,3-dihydro-3-hydroxy-2-(p-methoxyphenyl)-1,5-benzothiazapin-4(5)-one 
acetate 
(ester), consists of a substituted benzothiazapene wherein 
both chiral carbon atoms have the S absolute stereo-configuration 
(H. Inoue etal., U.S. Patent No. 3,562,257). 
Diltiazem has proven useful for the treatment of angina due 
to coronary artery spasm, and for exertional angina. The 
beneficial therapeutic effects achieved with diltiazem are 
believed to be derived from the inhibition of calcium ion 
influx during depolarization of the cell membrane in both 
cardiac and smooth muscle. Diltiazem is known to prevent 
coronary artery spasm, both spontaneous and ergonovine 
provoked, and to decrease peripheral vascular resistance. 
Diltiazem is marketed by Tanabe and by Marion Laboratories in 
the United States, where it is sold under the tradename 
Cardizem®. Analogues to diltiazem are also known to exist, 
e.g., wherein the benzothiazapene moiety has a single
