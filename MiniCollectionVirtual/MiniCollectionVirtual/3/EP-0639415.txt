<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of making a rotationally symmetrical body, in particular a disc carrier (1, 1') for an automatic transmission. The core of the invention consists in that an integral blank (3) intended, in particular, for use as a disc carrier (1, 1') is produced from a plate (2) by cold deformation involving predrawing or deep-drawing and ironing, and spinning, the blank having     a) a centrally arranged collar (4) and b) a wall (5) which is arranged radially to the outside of the collar (4) and concentrically with the collar (4) and is cylindrical on the outside and also in part on the inside, and having an annular end wall (6) which connects the collar (4) and the wall (5); c) in that, furthermore, an internal toothing (7) is produced on the inside (8) of the cylindrical wall (5) and d) in that a radially outward-directed flange (10) is simultaneously produced, likewise in an integral manner, on the free edge (9) of the cylindrical wall (5).

A process for producing a rotationally symmetrical body, in 
particular a plate carrier (1, 1') for an automatic transmission, by shaping 

a plate blank portion (2), characterised in that 

a) firstly to produce a collar (4) a cup-shaped depression (12) is 

produced in the plate blank portion (2), 
b) an auxiliary opening (13) is then produced in the depression (12), 
c) the cup-shaped depression (12) is then shaped to form a cylindrical 
collar (4') by drawing/deep-drawing. 
d) then the cylindrical collar (4) is brought to its definitive length 
and its definitive cross-section by stretching down. 
e) thereupon the edge region (17) of the plate blank portion (2) is 
shaped by flow-pressing coaxially and at a spacing relative to the collar 

(4) to produce an externally and partially internally cylindrical wall (5) 
having an internal tooth arrangement (7) and 
f) to produce a radially outwardly directed flange (10) at the free 
edge (9) of the cylindrical wall (5). 
A process according to claim 1 characterised in that the auxiliary 
opening (13) in the depression (12) is produced by stamping. 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the externally cylindrical wall (5) is initially 

partially produced by deep drawing, whereupon the wall (5), the internal 
tooth arrangement (7) and the radially directed flange (10) are shaped by 

flow-pressing. 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the externally cylindrical wall (5) with the internal  

 
tooth arrangement (7) and with the radially directed flange (10) is produced 

stepwise by flow-pressing. 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that to produce the externally cylindrical wall (5) having 

a flange (10) firstly a blank (3') as an intermediate product receives an 
inwardly curved, bell-like wall (18). 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a radially directed through opening (16) is produced 

in the collar (4) by stamping prior to production of the externally 
cylindrical wall (5). 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the blank (3) which serves as the plate carrier (1, 

1') and which has an externally cylindrical wall (5) with a radially 
directed flange (10), an annular end portion (6) and a centrally arranged 

collar (4) is subjected to cutting finishing machining. 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that the auxiliary opening (13) produced by stamping is 

compressed along its free edge before further shaping of the edge region is 
effected. 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that to produce a collar (4'') of greater length firstly 

material is displaced out of the region of the end portion (6) to the centre 
(11) of the plate blank portion (2) before the cup-shaped depression (12) is 

produced in a plurality of steps by pre-drawing. 
A process according to at least one of the preceding claims 
characterised in that a through opening (26) having a step (27) is produced 

in the end portion (6) by non-cutting cold shaping and that the through  
 

opening (26) receives a valve chamber (28) of larger internal cross-section 
for accommodating a valve closure body (29) and that a free edge (32) of the 

valve chamber (28) is constricted by cold shaping after insertion of the 
valve closure body (29) into the valve chamber (28). 
A process according to claim 10 characterised in that lugs (33) 
which hold the valve closure body (29) and which are produced by 

displacement of material are formed on the end portion (6) by a non-cutting 
procedure after insertion of the valve closure body (29).
