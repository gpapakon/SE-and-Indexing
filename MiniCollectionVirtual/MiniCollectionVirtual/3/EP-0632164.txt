<ABSTRACT>
Permanent way with rails (2) for rail-bound vehicles, in which the rails (2) are releasably connected by fastening means, e.g. screws (10) and clamping clips (11), to supporting plates (1), e.g. concrete supporting slabs, steel sleepers, prestressed concrete sleepers, and between rail foot (4) and supporting plate (1) there is provided at least one elastomerically deformable, in particular plane-parallel, intermediate plate (5, 7) which extends, if necessary, to beyond the fastening means (10), the intermediate plate (5, 7) exhibiting regions of varying deformability with recesses (12, 17) which do not fully penetrate the intermediate plate in its thickness, and form blind holes, grooves or the like with a bottom, at least some of the recesses (12, 17) exhibiting, at their bottom, projections (13) with a lower height than those of the corresponding recesses, the cross-sectional area of the projections being smaller than that of the recesses, measured parallel to the bearing surface (14) of the intermediate plate.

Track bed with rails (2) for rail vehicles, whereby 
the rails (2) are connected detachably by fastening 

means, e.g. screws (10) and retaining clips (11), to 
supporting slabs (1), e.g. concrete supporting slabs, 

steel sleepers, pre-stressed concrete sleepers, and at 
least one elastically deformable, in particular plane 

parallel intermediate pad (5, 7) is provided between rail 
flange (4) and supporting slab (1) and optionally extends laterally 

beyond the fastening means (10), whereby the intermediate 
pad (5, 7) exhibits portions of different deformability 

with a plurality of recesses which do not pass completely 
through the thickness of the intermediate pad, but form 

blind holes, slots or the like with a bottom,
 
characterised in that at their bottom at least one part 

of the recesses (12, 17) exhibit free-standing 
projections (13) with a lesser height than that of the 

corresponding recesses, the cross-sectional area of the 
projections being less than that of the recesses, 

measured parallel to the supporting surface (14) of the 
intermediate pad. 
Track bed according to claim 1, characterised in 
that the projections (13) correspond in their form to the 

recesses (12, 17), e.g. are circular in cross-section. 
Track bed according to claim 1 or 2, characterised 
in that the projections (13) run plane parallel to the 

supporting surface (14) at their free ends (15). 
Track bed according to claim 1, 2 or 3, 
characterised in that the projections (13c, 13d) are 

embodied so that they taper from the bottom to the free 
end. 
Track bed according to one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that the projections (13e, 13f) exhibit  

 
a recess (19) at their free end (15). 
Track bed according to one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the projections (13b) are embodied 

so that they taper only in their free end portion. 
Track bed according to one of claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that the recesses (12, 17) exhibit 

different heights. 
Track bed according to one of claims 1 to 7, 
characterised in that the projections (13) exhibit 

different heights and their free ends (15) are different 
distances from the supporting surface (14). 
Track bed according to one of claims 1 to 8, 
characterised in that the recesses (12, 17) exhibit the 

same height viewed at right angles to the longitudinal 
direction of the rails and the projections (13) in the 

portion under the rail head exhibit a lesser height than 
those on both sides of this portion, 
Track bed according to one of claims 1 to 9, 
characterised in that the recesses (12, 17) are 

distributed evenly over the intermediate pad (5, 7) 
except in the edge portions. 
Track bed according to one of claims 1 to 8 and 10, 
characterised in that the height of the projections (13) 

increases viewed at right angles to the longitudinal 
direction of the rails so that the distance of the free 

ends (15) of the projections from the supporting surface 
(14) decreases.
