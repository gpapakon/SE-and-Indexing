<ABSTRACT>
The device (3) for fixing a dental prosthesis (9) possesses a base (4) insertable in a jaw bone (1), a holder (5) and a sleeve (6). The base (4) has a hole (4e) which opens in its front (4d) and has an internal screw thread (4g) and a widening (4h), and a conical annular surface (4k) surrounding the opening of the hole (4e). The holder (5) has a threaded section (5c) which penetrates the sleeve (6) in the assembled state of the device (3) and is screwed into the internal screw thread (4g) of the base (4), and an external member (5b) located outside the base (4) and serving to hold a dental prosthesis (9). In the assembled state of the device (3) the sleeve (6) sits in the widening (4h) of the hole (4e) and rests by a conical outer surface (6a) firmly against a conical inner surface (4i) of the base (4). Furthermore, the external member (5b) of the holder (5) rests by a conical stop surface (5g) firmly against the annular surface (4k) of the base (4). In the assembled state of the device, the holder (5) is firmly connected to the base (4) and covers the front of the latter without any gaps.

(9) to a jaw bone (1), having a base (4), intended to be 

fitted into a hole (1a) in the jaw bone (1), and a holder 
(5, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75), which can be connected to 

the base and is intended for holding the tooth 
replacement (9) outside the jaw bone (1), the base (4) 

having an end face (4d), a hole (4e) with an opening 
located on the end face (4d), with an internal screw 

thread (4g) and with a widened section (4h) which widens 
from this internal screw thread to the end face (4d) and 

is at least in part bounded by a conical internal surface 
(4i), and having an annular surface (4k) which surrounds 

the opening of the hole (4e), and the holder (5, 25, 35, 
45, 55, 65, 75) having an inner part (5a, 25a, 35a, 45a, 

55a, 65a, 75a), intended to be arranged in the hole (4e) 
in the base (4) and with an external screw thread (5d, 

25d), intended to be screwed together with the internal 
screw thread (4g) of the base (4), as well as an outer 

part (5b, 25b, 35b, 45b, 55b, 65b, 75b), irremovably 
joined to the inner part (5a, 25a, 35a, 45a, 55a, 65a, 

75a), intended to be arranged outside the base (4) and 
designed to rest on the annular surface (4k) of the base 

(4), characterized in that there is a sleeve (6, 16, 26) 
with an axial through-hole (6e, 16e, 26e) and with a 

conical external surface (6a, 16a, 26a) intended to rest 
on the conical internal surface (4i) of the base (4), and 

in that the inner part (5a, 25a, 35a, 45a, 55a, 65a, 75a) 
of the holder (5, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75) can be screwed, 

through the hole (4e), together with the internal screw  

 
thread (4g) of the base (4). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the conical internal surface (4i) of the base (4) 

and the conical external surface (6a, 16a, 26a) of the 
sleeve (6, 16, 26) form equal angles with an axis (7), 

which are preferably at least 5° and at most 15°. 
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that the holder (5, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75) has a 

bearing surface (5g), intended to rest on the annular 
surface (4k) of the base (4), and in that the annular 

surface (4k) as well as the bearing surface (5g) are 
designed in such a way that, when the device is 

assembled, they rest flush on one another around the 
opening of the hole (4e) in the base (4). 
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in 
that the annular surface (4k) and the bearing surface 

(5g) are, when the holder (5, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75) is 
connected to the base (4), inclined outwards with respect 

to that end of the base (4) which is remote from the 
holder (5, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75), the annular surface 

(4k) as well as the bearing surface (5g) preferably 
forming an angle of at least 20° and preferably at most 

70° with an axis (7). 
Device according to Claim 3 or 4, characterized 
in that the holder (5, 25, 35, 45) has a smooth lateral 

surface portion (5h) which adjoins the outer edge of the 
bearing surface (5g) and has an axial dimension of at
