<ABSTRACT>
According to the prior art, an optical-fibre branched star telecommunications network comprises either low-throughput terminal equipment (21 - 2l) using reversible optical components for a half-duplex transmission mode, or high-throughput terminal equipment using optical duplexers for a duplex transmission mode with wavelength-division multiplexing. The invention supplies uplink and downlink frames allowing these two types of terminal equipment to be connected to the same central equipment (1) in a branched network with a wavelength-division multiplexing transmission mode. Half-duplex mode is provided for each low-throughput terminal equipment item by a shift of a frame half-period, modulo the frame period between uplink frame data sectors and downlink frame data sectors. The data produced by the high-throughput equipment are transmitted in uplink and downlink frame sectors not occupied by low-throughput data.
