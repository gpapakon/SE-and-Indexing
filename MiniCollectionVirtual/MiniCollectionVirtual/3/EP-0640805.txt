<ABSTRACT>
An ammunition (projectile, round) feeding device for an armoured howitzer having a turret (T) which is arranged on a vehicle in the region behind the vehicle centre, can rotate and on which a heavy weapon (25) is arranged such that it can pivot in elevation. An ammunition magazine (23) is arranged in the turret rear (H), and a loading/unloading opening (B), which is accessible from the rear, is arranged in the vehicle rear (H). A guide (2.1) which runs in the transverse direction and on which a carriage (2) is displaceably guided is mounted on the roof plate (D) of the turret (T), between the weapon (25) and the ammunition magazine (23). A downwardly extending supporting arm (1) is attached to the carriage (2), on which supporting arm (1) a loading cradle holder (9) is movably guided, which is fitted with a loading cradle (22). The arrangement is such that the loading cradle (22) can be moved into a position aligned with the barrel boresight (bore axis) of the weapon when the weapon (25) is in at least one elevation position, and into positions in which the rear end of the loading cradle (22) is located immediately in front of the ammunition magazine (23) as well as into a position in which the rear end of the loading cradle (22) is directly adjacent to the front end of a roller track (24) which is arranged in the region of the loading/unloading opening (B).

Shell-feeding device for a tank howitzer with a
rotatable turret (T) which is disposed on a vehicle in the

region behind the centre of the vehicle and on which a
heavy weapon (25) is disposed so as to be pivotable in

elevation, wherein a shell magazine (23) for receiving
shells (G1) which are stored essentially horizontally with

the nose of the shell pointing forward is disposed in the
rear of the turret, behind the weapon, and a

loading/unloading aperture (B) which is accessible from the
rear is disposed in the rear of the vehicle, and in which

there is fastened to the inside of the roof panel (D) of
the turret (T), between the rear end of the weapon (25) and

the shell magazine (23), a guide (2.1) which extends in the
transverse direction and on which a carriage (2) is

displaceably guided, and there is suspended, from the
carriage (2), a carrying arm (1) which extends downwards

into the interior of the turret and on which there is
guided, so as to be movable along the said carrying arm

(1), a loading tray receptacle (11) which carries a loading
tray (22) in such a way that the longitudinal axis of the

loading tray can be brought, in at least one elevational
position of the weapon (25), into a location in alignment

with the axis of the bore of the weapon, and also into
locations in which the rear end of the loading tray (22)

lies immediately in front of predetermined storage places
in the shell magazine (23), and into a location in which

the rear end of the loading tray (22) is immediately
adjacent to the front end of a roller track (24) disposed

in the region of the loading/unloading aperture (B).
Shell-feeding device according to claim 1, characterised
in that the loading tray (22) is connected to the loading

tray receptacle (11) so as to be tiltable about an axis
parallel to the axis of the trunnion of the weapon (25). 
Shell-feeding device according to claim 1 or 2,
characterised in that the carrying arm (1) is essentially

orientated vertically downwards and the loading tray
receptacle (11) is guided so as to be displaceable on the

carrying arm (1) perpendicularly to the axis of the
trunnion of the weapon (25).
Shell-feeding device according to claim 1, characterised
in that the carrying arm (1') is orientated downwards in an

essentially curved manner and the loading tray receptacle
(11') is guided on a circular trajectory on the carrying

arm (1'), the centre point of which trajectory lies on the
axis (S) of the trunnion of the weapon (25'), the loading

tray (22') being fixedly connected to the loading tray
receptacle (11').
Shell-feeding device according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that there is disposed, in the loading

tray (22, 22'), a loading tray inner part (9, 9') which is
of tray-like construction and can be moved out of the

loading tray (22, 22') in the direction of the weapon (25,
25').
Shell-feeding device according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that a chain drive (3, 3') disposed on the

carrying arm serves to drive the loading tray receptacle

(11, 11') along the said carrying arm (1, 1').
Shell-feeding device according to claim 6, characterised
in that the chain drive (3) can be driven by means of a

hand crank (4).
Shell-feeding device according to claim 6, characterised
in that the chain drive (3, 3') can be driven by means of a

driving motor (26, 26') 
Shell-feeding device according to claim 7 or 8,
characterised in that a spring equilibrator (16, 17, 17.1)
