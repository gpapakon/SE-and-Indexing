Method for controlling combustion in a four-stroke
engine which may or may not be a controlled-ignition

engine, which has valve timing or rotary timing
and comprises, for each cylinder, a combustion chamber in

which the air/fuel mixture, having been drawn in by the
piston, is compressed by the latter in order to be

ignited therein, thus increase in volume and push back
the piston thus producing the power stroke, there being a

secondary combustion chamber in addition to the main
chamber for igniting a mixture of air and of fuel let

into the main chamber using the jet of flame issuing from
the secondary chamber, characterized:


in that the secondary combustion chamber is
entirely separate from and has no permanent direct link

with the main combustion chamber, is fed independently
and separately with compressed air/fuel mixture and

operates on a cycle different from and dependent on the
main chamber,
in that during operation, following the
induction and compression strokes, not much before or

appreciably after the mixture in the small secondary
combustion chamber has been ignited, at least one

connecting port between the main combustion chamber and
the secondary combustion chamber is opened,
in that the expansion of the gases contained in
the secondary combustion chamber takes place within the

main combustion chamber through at least one connecting
port, the volume of the small secondary combustion

chamber is kept substantially constant at its small 
volume so that the entire effect of the expansion of the

gases during combustion is used to push back the engine
piston of the main cylinder,
in that fuel-free air is let into the main
cylinder when the engine operates at low power and when

the power stroke is then provided only by the expansion
of the gases contained in the small secondary combustion

chamber, whereas for operation at medium and high load,
when the engine operates at greater power operated of a

mixture of air and fuel is let into the main cylinder to
be ignited by the "jet of flame" issuing from the

secondary chamber.
Method for controlling combustion in a four-stroke
engine according to Claim 1, during the combustion

or expansion and exhaust strokes, characterized in that
the volume of the small secondary combustion chamber is

kept substantially constant at its small volume in order
better to empty the small secondary combustion chamber

during the exhaust stroke.
Method for controlling combustion in a four-stroke
engine according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized in

that during operation in light-load mode, when the main
cylinder is supplied with air alone, during the induction

and compression strokes, a valve that vents the main
chamber to atmosphere is opened in order to avoid pumping

effects on induction and back-pressures on the piston
during the compression stroke.
Method for controlling combustion according to
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the secondary

chamber is fed with heterogenous air/fuel mixtures, like
a diesel engine.
Method for controlling combustion according to
Claims 1 to 3, characterized in that the main cylinder

operates with heterogenous air/fuel mixtures, like a
diesel engine, the start of combustion then being controlled

by the opening of the connecting port, it being
possible in this case for the secondary combustion

chamber to be fed either with homogenous mixtures with 
controlled ignition, or according to Claim 4 with

heterogenous mixtures like a diesel engine.
Device for implementing the method according to
Claims 1 to 3 in an engine with rotary timing comprising,

positioned on the assembly comprising liner and piston
(2), (1), combustion chamber (7) and sealing ring (9), a

rotary distributor (4) with a single lateral transfer
port (5) which, as it rotates in turn, places the exhaust

duct (6) in communication with the combustion chamber
(7), then places the combustion chamber (7) in communication

with the induction duct (8), characterized by the
addition, in another transverse plane, of a small

secondary combustion chamber (12) which opens into the
rotary distributor (4), this communication being sealed

by a sliding ring (12B) and which chamber is fed by an
independent induction circuit, air duct (19), injector

(21), throttle valve (20) with air/fuel mixture compressed
by a piston (17) and in which chamber the

air/fuel mixture is ignited by a spark plug (13) at the
end of compression while, as it rotates, the rotary

distributor (4) in which a connecting port (14) is formed
will, not much before or substantially after the mixture

has been ignited, establish a communication between the
secondary combustion chamber (12) and the main combustion

chamber (7) which in light-load operation is fed with air
alone, and the air/fuel mixture ignited in the secondary

chamber (12) will expand in the main combustion chamber
(7) pushing back the piston (1) and thus providing the

power stroke, the expansion of the gases contained in the
secondary combustion chamber taking place in the main

combustion chamber through the connecting port, whereas
in medium/full-load operation, the main combustion

chamber (7) is fed with air/fuel mixture and the "jet of
flame" issuing from the secondary combustion chamber (12)

through the connecting port (14) will in turn ignite the
air/fuel mixture in the main chamber where the burning

gases of the two chambers will expand, thus pushing back
the piston and providing the power stroke. 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized by a
desmodromic dual-acting cam (18) control of the piston

(17) compressing the air/fuel mixture in the secondary
combustion chamber (12) where the top dead centre

position of the said piston (17) will be maintained
during the combustion, expansion and exhaust strokes in

order, on the one hand, to avoid a needless drop in the
pressure of the expanding gases so that all of the effect

of the expansion will be used to push back the engine
piston (1) of the main cylinder, and on the other hand

best empty the secondary combustion chamber (12) through
an orifice (16) produced for this purpose in the rotary

distributor (4), the said cam (18) thereafter, during the
induction stroke, allowing the piston (17) cont
rolling
the supply to the secondary chamber (12) to be brought to

its bottom dead centre position to allow induction of the
air/fuel mixture and then push this same piston (17) back

towards top dead centre during the compression stroke in
order to compress the air/fuel mixture in the secondary

combustion chamber (12) where it will be ignited by the
spark plug (13).
Device according to Claim 6, characterized by the
use of an electronically controlled solenoid valve (15)

allowing the main chamber (7) to be vented to atmosphere
during light-load operation when the main cylinder

feeding the main combustion chamber (7) is fed only with
fuel-free air, during the induction strokes in order to

avoid pumping effects and during the compression strokes
in order to avoid back-pressures on the piston (1), the

solenoid valve remaining closed once the main cylinder
and the main combustion chamber (7) are fed with air/fuel

mixture, in order to allow this cylinder to operate in
the normal way.
Device according to Claim 6 where the secondary
chamber (12) is fed with heterogenous air/fuel mixtures

like in diesel engines, characterized by the fitting of a
direct injector (22) as used in diesel engines into the

secondary chamber. 
Device according to Claim 6, where the main
cylinder and the main combustion chamber (7) are fed with

heterogenous mixtures like in diesel engines, characterized
by the fitting of a direct injector (23) and of a

pressurized fuel circuit like those used in diesel
engines into the main chamber.
Device according to Claim 6, in an engine with
valve timing comprising, positioned on the assembly

comprising liner and piston (2), (1), a combustion
chamber into which there open induction and exhaust ducts

shut off by valves, characterized by a connecting or
transfer port (24) situated at the top of this chamber

which it connects to a small secondary combustion chamber
(12) fed with air/fuel mixture compressed by a piston

(17) and a secondary induction circuit consisting of an
air duct, an injector and a throttle valve (19), (21),

(20), the secondary piston (17) being controlled by a
dual-acting cam (18), a shutter (25) being positioned in

the transfer port (24) to establish and as it opens
according to a cycle a communication between the small

secondary combustion chamber (12) and the main combustion
chamber (7), the cycles and the light-load or medium/

full-load operating modes being the same as those
described in Claims 1 to 10.
Device according to Claim 11, characterized by
the use of a rotary distributor (26) to allow the cyclic

shutting off and opening of the transfer port (24)
between the main combustion chamber (7) and the small

secondary combustion chamber (12), the combustion
chambers (7), (12) being sealed by sliding rings (9),

(12B), and the rotary distributor, in which a transfer
duct (27) is formed, being driven by the engine crankshaft

either at one quarter of the speed of the crankshaft
if the sealing rings are in the same transverse

plane, the transfer duct (27) thus operating in both
directions, or at half the crankshaft speed if the

sealing rings are in a different transverse plane, the 
transfer duct (27) thus always operating in the same

direction.
