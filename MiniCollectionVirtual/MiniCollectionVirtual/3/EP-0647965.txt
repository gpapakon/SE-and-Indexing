<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
treating Si-O containing ceramic coatings derived from
hydrogen silsesquioxane resin (H-resin) with hydrogen gas.
The resultant coatings have desirable properties.The use of silica-containing ceramic coatings
derived from H-resin on electronic devices is known in the
art. For instance, U.S. Patent No. 4,756,977 describes
processes for forming such coatings which comprise diluting
hydrogen silsesquioxane in solvents, applying the solutions
to substrates, evaporating the solvents and heating the
coated substrates to a temperature of 150 to 1000°C. in air.
This patent, however, does not describe the effects of
annealing the coatings with hydrogen gas or the impact on
electrical properties.The conversion of H-resin to an Si-O containing
ceramic in other environments is also known in the art. For
instance, European Patent Application No. 90311008.8 teaches
the conversion of H-resin in an inert gas atmosphere. This
document also does not describe annealing the coatings with
hydrogen gas or the impact on electrical properties.The present inventor has now found that when Si-O
containing coatings derived from H-resin are treated with
hydrogen gas, the properties of the coating are improved.The present invention provides a method of forming
an Si-O containing coating on an electronic substrate. The
method comprises first applying a coating comprising H-resin
on an electronic substrate. The coated electronic substrate
is then heated to a temperature sufficient to convert the H-resin
to an Si-O containing ceramic coating. The Si-O
containing ceramic coating is then exposed to an atmosphere 
containing hydrogen gas for a time and at a temperature
sufficient to anneal the coating.The present invention also relates to Si-O
containing ceramic coatings having a dielectric constant
less than or equal to 4.5.The present invention is based on the unexpected
finding that annealing Si-O containing ceramic coatings
derived from H-resin with hydrogen gas improves the
properties of the coatings. For instance, such an anneal
can lower the dielectric constant of the coating and render
it stable. Moreover, such treatment may also advantageously
affect the physical properties of the coating (e.g.,
moisture absorption, cracking, etc.) These effects are
surprising since it was not known in the art how hydrogen
gas would affect the coatings and their resultant
properties.Because of these benefits and advantages, the
coatings resulting from this invention are particularly
valuable on
