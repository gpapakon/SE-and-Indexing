<ABSTRACT>
In an exhaust gas purifier for an internal
combustion engine having a trap for trapping particulate

matters contained in exhaust gas discharged from the
internal combustion engine, the present invention aims

at suppressing production of ashes and thereby
preventing pressure logs associated with the clogging of

the trap. In order to achieve this object, the present
invention provides an exhaust gas purifier for an

internal combustion engine having a trap for trapping
particulate matters contained in exhaust gas discharged

from the internal combustion engine, wherein the trap
carries a metal which has an electronegetivity equal to

or lower than a predetermined content contained in fuel
or lubricating oil for the internal combustion engine.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an exhaust gas
purification technology for removing particulate matters
from exhaust gas discharged from an internal combustion
engine.It is demanded of an internal combustion engine
installed in a motor vehicle or the like to improve
exhaust emission properties by purifying noxious gas
contents contained in exhaust gas such as nitrogen
oxides (NOx) and hydrocarbon (HC). Especially in the
case of a diesel engine, it is also important to reduce
so-called particulate matters (PM) such as soot end SOF
(soluble organic fractions) as well as nitrogen oxides
(NOx) and hydrocarbon (HC).To meet such a demand, "an exhaust gas purifier for
an internal combustion engine" as disclosed in Japanese
Patent Gazette No. 2722987 has been proposed.The exhaust gas purifier for the internal
combustion engine disclosed in the above-mentioned
publication is constructed as follows. A particulate
filter for trapping particulate matters in exhaust gas
is provided in an exhaust passage of the internal
combustion engine. An NOx absorbent, which absorbs NOx
in exhaust gas when the exhaust gas demonstrates a lean 
air-fuel ratio and which discharges and reduces the
absorbed NOx when the exhaust gas demonstrates a low
concentration of oxygen and there is a reducing agent,
is disposed at Such a location that heat transfer to the
particulate filter is possible. The exhaust gas
purifier for the internal combustion engine thus
constructed is intended to burn and remove particulate
matters trapped in the particulate filter by raising a
temperature of the particulate filter with the aid of
heat generated at the time of an oxidizing reaction of
the reducing agent on the NOx absorbent.By the way, agglomeration of compounds called ashes
may clog exhaust flow passages in the particulate filter
and increase pressure loss in exhaust gas.The mechanism of production of ashes has not been
unriddled yet but is hypothesized as follows.That is, fuel or lubricating oil for the internal
combustion engine (so-called engine oil) contains
various additives and impurities. These contents bond
to one another in combustion chambers of the internal
combustion engine or on the particulate filter, thus
forming various compounds. These compounds agglomerate
on the particulate filter and form ashes.For example, fuel or lubricating oil for the
internal combustion engine contains sulfur (S) contents,
phosphorus (P) contents, calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg)
and the like. The contents contained in blow-by gas 
(lubricating oil) bond to
