<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus such as a copying machine, a printer and the like, and more particularly, it relates to an image forming apparatus capable of forming images on both faces of a recording material.Fig. 10 shows an example of a conventional image forming apparatus in which a full-color image is formed by transferring a plurality of toner images having different colors onto a single recording material in a superposed fashion. This image forming apparatus includes a photosensitive drum (image bearing member) 2 rotatably supported by a body 1 of the apparatus for rotational movement in a direction shown by the arrow. Around the photosensitive drum 2, there are arranged, in order along a rotational direction of the drum, a charge device 3, an optical system 5, a developing means 6, a transfer device 7 and a cleaning device 9.The optical system 5 comprises an original scanning portion, a color decomposing filter, and a laser beam exposure device for illuminating a color-decomposed light image E or equivalent light image E onto the photosensitive drum 2. By illuminating the light image E for each color onto the photosensitive drum 2 uniformly charged by the charge device 3, an electrostatic latent image is formed on the photosensitive drum 2. The developing means 6 is of rotatable type and includes a rotary member 6b rotated around a central shaft 6a, and four developing devices (i.e. black developing device 6BK, cyan developing device 6C, magenta developing device 6M and yellow developing device 6Y) mounted on the rotary member. A desired developing device is brought to a developing position where the developing device is opposed to the photosensitive drum 2 by rotating the rotary member 6b, so that the electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum 2 is developed with toner (including resin as a base material) to obtain a toner image.Then, the toner image on the photosensitive drum 2 is transferred onto a recording material supplied to a transfer position (opposed to the photosensitive drum 2) from a recording material cassette 10 through a sheet path (shown by the dot line in Fig. 10) by a convey system and the transfer device 7. The transfer device 7 comprises a transfer drum 7a, a transfer corona charger 7b, an absorb corona charger 7c for electrostatically absorbing the recording material, an absorb roller 7d opposed to the absorb corona charger, an inner corona charger 7e and an outer corona charger 7f. Further, a peripheral opening area of the
