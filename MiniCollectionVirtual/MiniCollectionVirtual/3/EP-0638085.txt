<ABSTRACT>
Many tumor-associated and leukocyte-associated carbohydrate antigens function as adhesion molecules, recognized by lectins (carbohydrate-protein interaction) or complementary carbohydrates (carbohydrate-carbohydrate interaction). Common structures are found in the tumor-associated and leukocyte-associated antigens. Metastatic potential of tumor cells as well as transendothelial migration of leukocytes was suppressed by agents, or combinations of agents of the groups: (a) carbohydrate antigens; (b) antibodies directed to those antigens; (c) oligosaccharide components of those antigens; (d) conjugates of the antigens or oligosaccharides; and (e) mimetics of the antigens or oligosaccharides. Disclosed are oligosaccharides and derivatives thereof which inhibit cell adhesion and aggregation mediated by P-selectin (GMP-140) and E-selectin (ELAM-1). Effective agents for those purposes include hybrid sugars comprising multiple epitopes, such as Le

, combination of individual sugars that comprise a hybrid sugar, which may be presented on liposomes, and antibodies or combinations of antibodies directed thereto.

Inhibition of Cell Adhesion by Chemically-Defined Oligosaccharides, Their Derivative Mimetics, and Antibodies Directed TheretoCross-Reference To Related ApplicationsThis application is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. Application Ser. No. 07/950720 filed 25 September, 1992; which is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. Application Ser. No. 07/836978 filed 19 February 1992; which is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. Application Ser. No. 07/789969 filed 12 November 1991; which is a continuation-in-part of pending U.S. Application Ser. No. 07/724983 filed 2 July 1991; which is a continuation-in-part of U.S. application Serial No. 07/575539 filed 30 August 1990 (abandoned) .All five applications expressly are incorporated herein by reference.Technical FieldThe present invention is directed generally to the inhibition of tumor cell metastases and invasiveness and of inflammatory processes based on the inhibition of adhesion of tumor cells or inflammatory leukocytes to specific types of cells. More specifically, the invention is directed to such inhibition through the use of tumor-associated carbohydrate 

antigens, leukocyte-associated carbohydrate antigens, oligosaccharide derivatives thereof, mimetics of the tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens, leukocyte-associated carbohydrate antigens and antibodies directed to the tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens.Background of the InventionDespite enormous investment of financial and human resources, cancer remains one of the major causes of death. Current cancer therapies cure only about half of all patients who develop a malignant tumor. In most human malignancies, metastasis is the major cause of death.Metastasis is the formation of secondary tumor colonies at one or more distant sites. Metastasis is a multistep process of which tumor invasion is the first step. Tumor cells locally invade host tissue barriers, such as the epithelial basement membrane, to reach the interstitial stroma where the tumor cells gain access to blood vessels (or lymphatic channels) for further dissemination. After invading the endothelial layer of the vessel wall, the circulating tumor cells are dislodged into the circulation and arrest in the precapillary venules of the target organ by adhering to endothelial cell lumenal surfaces or exposed basement membranes. The tumor cells again invade the vascular wall to enter the organ parenchyma. Finally, the extravasated tumor cell grows in a tissue different from where the tumor originated. 

 In most human malignancies,
