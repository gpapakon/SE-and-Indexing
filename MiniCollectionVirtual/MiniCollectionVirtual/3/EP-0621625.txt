The present invention relates to a color cathode
ray tube apparatus such as a color picture tube and,
more particularly, to a color cathode ray tube apparatus
using a dynamic focus scheme for correcting a deflection
error caused by a magnetic field generated by a
deflection yoke.In general, a color picture tube apparatus, as
shown in FIG. 1, has an envelope constituted by a panel
1 and a funnel 2 integrally connected to the panel 1,
and a phosphor screen 3 constituted by stripe-like or
dot-like tricolor phosphor layers for emitting blue,
green, and red beams is formed on the inner surface of
the panel 1. A shadow mask 4 in which a large number of
apertures are formed is arranged opposite to the
phosphor screen inside the panel 1. On the
other hand, an electron gun assembly 7 for emitting
three electron beams 6B, 6G, and 6R is arranged in a
neck 5 of the funnel 2. The three electron beams 6B,
6G, and 6R emitted from the electron gun assembly 7 are
deflected by horizontal and vertical magnetic fields
generated by a deflection unit 8 arranged outside the
funnel 2, and the phosphor screen 3 is horizontally and
vertically scanned through the shadow mask 4, thereby
displaying a color image on the phosphor screen.As the above color picture tube apparatus, an in-line
type color picture tube apparatus in which 
an electron gun assembly for emitting three electron
beams 6B, 6G, and 6R arranged in a line, constituted by
the center beam 6G and the pair of side beams 6B and 6R,
and passing through the same horizontal plane is used as
the electron gun assembly 7 is known.The electron gun assembly 7 generally comprises an
electron beam generating section constituted by a
cathode and a plurality of electrodes sequentially
arranged adjacent to each other on the cathode, for controlling
electron emission from the cathode and focusing
the emitted electrons to form three electron beams 6B,
6G, and 6R and a main electron lens section constituted
by a plurality of electrodes for focusing and converging
the three electron beams 6B, 6G, and 6R obtained from
the electron beam generating section on the phosphor
screen 3.In the above color picture tube apparatus, in order
to obtain excellent image characteristics on the
phosphor screen 3, the three electron beams 6B, 6G, and
6R emitted from the electron gun assembly 7 must be
appropriately focused, and electron beams 6B, 6G, and 6R
must be converged on the entire area of the phosphor
screen 3.Of the above required conditions, convergence of
the electron beams 6B, 6G, and 6R, as
