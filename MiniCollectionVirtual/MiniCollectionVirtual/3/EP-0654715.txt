<ABSTRACT>
An image forming apparatus comprises an image 

bearing member for bearing an image, and a movable 
member (131) which is abutted against the image bearing 

member and onto which the image on the image bearing 
member is transferred. The movable member includes a 

substrate (3), a sheet-like member (1), and an elastic layer (2) 
disposed between the substrate and the sheet-like 

member and compressed to a predetermined thickness 
before the movable member is abutted against the image 

bearing member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image forming
apparatus wherein an image formed on an image bearing
member is transferred onto a movable body. More
particularly, it relates to an image forming apparatus
wherein an image formed on an image bearing member is
transferred onto a transfer sheet born on a movable body
such a transfer drum to form an image on the transfer
sheet.As a way for obtaining an image by transferring
an image formed on an image bearing member onto a transfer
sheet born on a transfer drum, there has been proposed
an method wherein an color image is formed on a transfer
sheet by superimposing a plurality of different color
toner images on the transfer sheet by repeating steps for
forming the toner image on an image bearing member by
charging, exposure and development and for transferring
the toner image onto the transfer sheet whenever the
toner image is formed. Such a color image forming
apparatus is disclosed in the German Patent No. 2607727
and the Japanese Patent Laid-open Application No. 50-50935
and is put into practical use.By the way, in such conventional color image 
forming apparatuses, the transfer sheet is wound around a
transfer drum constituted by a pair of ring members, a
connection member connecting between the ring members,
and a high resistive sheet or film covering an opening
defined by the ring members and the connection member.
However, in such a transfer drum, independent charge
means are required as an absorb charger, a transfer
charger, a separation charger and an electricity removal
charger for the transfer sheet, and there is a problem
regarding the strength and handling of the transfer drum,
since the opening defined by the ring members and the
connection member is closed by the high resistive film.On the other hand, to eliminate the above problem,
as disclosed in EP-A-548803, the inventors have proposed
a transfer device comprising a transfer drum constituted
by laminating an elastic layer and a high resistive film
on a conductive cylinder.In such a transfer device, the transferring
operation by using the transfer drum constituted by
laminating the elastic layer and the high resistive film
on the conductive cylinder is effected by forming a nip
between the image bearing member and the transfer drum,
and the transferring efficiency is greatly influenced
upon a width of the nip. The nip width is determined
by an compressed amount t of the elastic layer of the
transfer drum against the image bearing member, i.e. a
difference between a radius of the transfer
