<ABSTRACT>
A modified polyvinyl alcohol and a solid state process for 
producing modified polyvinyl alcohol wherein polyvinyl alcohol powder is 

sprayed with a sufficient amount of a solution of a polymerizable 
monomer to swell the polyvinyl alcohol powder but not dissolve it or 

form a slurry. The swollen polyvinyl alcohol powder is sprayed with a 
free radical source (an initiator) and the temperature is raised to 

initiate a reaction between polyvinyl alcohol and the polymerizable 
monomer.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates a modified polyvinyl alcohol and its
preparation using a solid state post-modification.Polyvinyl alcohol is the largest volume, synthetic, water-soluble
and biodegradable resin produced in the world. Its success is due in
part to its excellent chemical resistance and physical properties as
well as to its very low toxicity. The main applications for polyvinyl
alcohol are in textile sizing, adhesives, polymerization stabilizers and
paper coatings. As demand increases for better performance in these and
other areas, more attention is given to production of polyvinyl alcohol
derivatives which can meet the demand. Chemically modifying polyvinyl
alcohol by introducing functional groups (for example, sulfonates,
phosphates and carboxylates) through copolymerization or post-modification
is one means of enhancing the physical properties of
polyvinyl alcohol.Copolymerization of vinyl acetate with functional vinyl monomers
followed by saponification is a well-known route to modification of
polyvinyl alcohol. Some applications of this technology are exemplified
in the following patents:JP 56-73199 teaches copolymerization of vinyl acetate with 2-acrylamidopropanesulfonic
acid or its metal salts, to produce a polymer
with improved flow properties for application in paper coatings.U.S.4,529,522 teaches production of copolymers of polyvinyl
alcohol and ethylene oxide or propylene oxide sulfonate ethers for use
as viscosifiers in saline solutions.JP 60-56196 teaches copolymerization of vinyl acetate with 0.1 to
0.3 mole percent sodium vinyl sulfonate or sodium allyl sulfonate and
hydrolysis of 30 to 60 percent the resulting copolymer. The product is
used in hot melt adhesives.JP 63-270704 teaches the manufacture of high polymerization degree
sulfonic acid-containing modified polyvinyl alcohol by copolymerizing N-sulfoalkyl(meth)acrylamide
and vinyl ester and then saponifying the
resulting copolymer. The products are useful as emulsifiers. Copolymerization allows the incorporation of a wide variety of
functional monomers, but entails large capital investment for recovery
of unreacted monomer. Differences in reactivity ratios may also make it
difficult to produce the desired functionality level and molecular
weight.Production of specialized grades of modified polyvinyl alcohol in
small to moderate volumes can be more economically achieved through
post-modification. Post-modification also provides a versatile process
for producing a variety of specialized products using a single process
unit.P
