<ABSTRACT>
Herein disclosed are a novel anti-HIV agent and a novel 
AIDS-treating drug, both comprising, as an active ingredient, a 

specific mineral ion solution, or a concentrate, a diluted 
solution or the solid matter thereof, said specific mineral ion 

solution having been obtained by keeping sandy tuff (starting 
mineral material) under warm and humid conditions to effect 

efflorescence of mud-yellow oxidized soil on the material, 
collecting the resultant oxidized soil and subsequently 

extracting it with water.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an anti-human immunodeficiency 
virus agent (anti-HIV agent) and a drug for treating AIDS 
(acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), each containing a 
specific mineral ion solution or the solid matter thereof as an 
active ingredient, as well as to such a mineral ion solution or 
solid matter thereof per se and a process for producing such a 
mineral ion solution. It has been revealed that an AIDS-treating drug AZT 
(azidothymidine: a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) can retard 
onset and progress of AIDS significantly. However, AZT has some 
drawbacks such as development of chronic toxicity resulting from 
its prolonged administration and generation of drug-resistant 
AIDS virus mutants. On the other hand, a therapeutic means in 
which DDI (dideoxyinosine) and AZT are used in combination has 
recently been approved, but this means also causes serious side 
effects such as acute pancreatitis and the like. Each of these 
drugs has poor selectivity, because they are mononucleosides and  
 
exert influences upon not only reverse transcriptase but also 
human polymerases. In view of such technical background, it is an object of 
the present invention to develop and provide a new anti-HIV 
agent, as well as an AIDS-treating agent, which is free from the 
aforementioned problems. With the aim of achieving the above object, the inventors 
of the present invention have conducted intensive studies and 
found a distinct anti-HIV activity in a certain mineral ion 
solution or the solid matter thereof which has been obtained by 
allowing sandy tuff as the starting mineral material to undergo 
weathering and extracting, with water, the mud-yellow oxidized 
soil formed on the surface, and have accomplished the present 
invention on the basis of these findings. Accordingly, the present invention relates to an anti-human 
immunodeficiency virus agent and an AIDS-treating drug, each 
comprising as an active ingredient a certain mineral ion 
solution or the solid matter thereof obtained by allowing sandy 
tuff (starting mineral material) to undergo weathering and 
extracting, with water, the mud-yellow oxidized soil effloresced 
on the tuff surface. It also relates to a process for producing such certain 
mineral ion solution, as well as to such a solution per se.  Incidentally, by the solid matter of a solution is meant 
the solute substances, because they form a solid residue when 
the solution is evaporated to dryness. First of all, a process for the production of the mineral 
ion solution to be
