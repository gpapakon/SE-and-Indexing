<DESCRIPTION>
 A ROTARY MACHINE FOR DELIVERING LIQUIDS OR GASESThe present invention relates to a rotary machine for delivering liquids or gases comprising a one-start or multi-start screw with a driving unit, a housing of said screw, provided with suction and delivery openings and a membrane body arranged between said housing and said screw. The machine according to the invention may be a pump or compressor and is very advantageous among others for pumping corrosive and erodent fluids or compressing gases.Nowdays, turbine pump, screw pumps, piston pumps and membrane pumps are generally used for delivering fluids.Turbine pumps have a rather high delivery and piston pumps have rather high lift. At the same time, the turbine pumps have rather low lift and the piston pumps have rather small delivery. Accordingly, neither of these pump has an advantageous performance characteristics for the practice.On the other side, the membrane pumps have rather low lift as well as delivery and, at the same time have to be provided with rectification valves, and a mechanism for producing reciprocating motion which is rather disadvantageous with respect to the construction and the costs. Further disadvantage is the pulsating character of the delivery.According to the above, screw pumps would be optimal for medium power and delivery requirements. This type of pumps is however rather complicated and expensive on the one hand, and has a rather high energy consumption, on the other hand. Furthermore, there are significant frictions within the pump, which would result in a relatively quick wearing.A screw pump comprises namely a housing provided with a two-start rib spiral on the inner surface which is in moving connection with the rotating screw. These two parts are moving with respect to each other with a planetary motion which can only be solved by a very complicated construction, otherwise both parts are wearing extremely quickly, though the housing is made in this case of a very deformable material with a rather thick wall. The planetary motion together with the high and asymmetric pressure and friction necessarily result in a quick wearing. 

 Membrane pumps are applied rather rarely due to their low performance, pulsating delivery, complicated reciprocating parts and the valves.Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a self-priming rotary displacement machine (pump or compressor) of relatively simple construction and good performance characteristics which does not contain reciprocating parts or valves.A further
