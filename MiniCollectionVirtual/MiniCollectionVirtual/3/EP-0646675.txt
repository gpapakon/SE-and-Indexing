<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of making joint-like seams at partial areas of asphalt surface layers by applying a ribbon-shaped bituminous material along the seam flank of a partial area in such a way that the bituminous material is plasticised, at least by mechanical action, and squeezed out in strand form via a forming nozzle and pressed against the seam flank. As a result, improved bonding to the seam area is achieved.

A method for the production of joint-like seams on
partial surfaces of asphalt surfacing by laying a

strip-like bitumen material along the seam flank of a
partial surface, characterised in that the bitumen

material is plasticised at least by mechanical action
and is squeezed out via a shaping nozzle in strand form

and is pressed against the seam flank.
A method according to Claim 1, characterised in
that in addition to the mechanical action the bitumen

material is subjected to thermal action.
A device for the production of joint-like seams on
partial surfaces in asphalt surfacing by laying a

strip-like bitumen material (15) along the seam flank
(13) of a partial surface (12), with a travelling gear

(1) provided with wheels (2), characterised in that a
continuously conveying, drivable kneading means (4) is

arranged on the travelling gear (1), which means is
provided with a charging means (9) for the bitumen

material (10) to be processed and with a shaping nozzle
(11) for the plasticised bitumen material.
A device according to Claim 3, characterised in
that at least the kneading means (4) is provided with a

heating means.
A device according to Claim 4, characterised in
that the heating means is formed by a heat-transfer

surface which is acted upon by the exhaust gases of an
internal combustion engine (7) which drives the

kneading means (4). 
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that at least one wheel (2) of the

travelling gear (1) is connected to the drive motor (7)
of the kneading means (4) so as to be controllable,

preferably dependent on the output rate of the kneading
means (4).
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 6,
characterised in that the shaping nozzle (11) is

oriented with its direction of ejection counter to the
direction of travel (21) of the travelling gear (1).
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 7,
characterised in that a pressure element (16) for the

strip-like bitumen material (15) emerging from the
shaping nozzle (11) is provided on the travelling gear

(1).
A device according to Claim 8, characterised in
that the pressure element (16), relative to the

direction of travel (21), is located close behind the
shaping nozzle (11).
A device according to one of Claims 8 or 9,
characterised in that the pressure element (16) is

connected to the travelling gear (1) so as to be
adjustable in height relative thereto.
A device according to one of Claims 8 to 10,
characterised in that the pressure element (16) is

designed to be guided so that it can be pressed against
the base surface next to the seam surface (13).
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 11,
characterised in that the travelling gear (1) is

provided with guide elements (22) which can be laid
against the seam flank (13) and which can preferably be 

transversely adjusted relative to the travelling gear
(1).
A device according to Claim 12, characterised in
that at least one guide element (22) is arranged in the

region of the pressure element (16).
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 13,
characterised in that the charging means (9) is

provided with a supply means for the bitumen material
which can be driven dependent on the output rate of the

kneading means (4).
A device according to Claim 14, characterised in
that the supply means is formed by a pinch-roll

arrangement.
A device according to one of Claims 3 to 15,
characterised in that the mouth of the exhaust of the

drive motor (7), viewed in the direction of travel
(21), opens out directed against the seam flank (13)

before the mouth of the shaping nozzle (11).
