<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a twin-wire (10,20) web 
former in a paper machine, comprising a single-wire 

initial portion, after which the twin-wire zone 
starts in the area of the ribbed deck (22a) of the 

first forming shoe (22) placed inside one of the wire 
loops (10). After the first forming shoe (22), a pressure-loaded 

(p
k
) dewatering unit (100) is fitted, 
which is provided with opposite sets of ribs (31,41) 

and with dewatering chambers (12,13). The first 
dewatering chamber (12) in this dewatering unit 

(100) is placed above the first forming shoe (22) so 
as, through its suction-deflector duct (16), to 

remove substantially water that drains from the area 
of the curved ribbed deck (22a) of the first forming 

shoe (22). The first dewatering chamber (12) is followed 

by a second dewatering chamber (13), whose 
lower part is connected with a set of dewatering and 

guide ribs (41), into whose gap spaces (41R) the 
drain duct (19) of the second dewatering chamber 

(13) is opened. Against the set of dewatering and 
guide ribs (41), a set of loading ribs operates, which 

is placed inside the opposite wire loop (20) and 
which operates by means of the medium pressure 

(p
k
) of the loading hoses (33).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention concerns a web former in a paper machine comprising a twin-wire
zone formed by guiding a looped upper wire over a looped lower wire, wherein the
web former comprises an initial, preferably substantially horizontal, single-wire
portion preceding the twin-wire zone and being formed in connection with the
looped lower wire, onto which initial single-wire portion a pulp jet is fed, the pulp
jet being alternatively fed directly into a gap formed between the upper and lower
wire loops with no initial single-wire portion in which case the twin-wire zone
comprises an initial portion formed in connection with a forming roll over which the
twin-wire zone is curved so that water is drained primarily through the lower wire
loop. In the applicant's FI Patent No. 75,375 (equivalent to US Pats. Nos. 4,614,566 and
4,744,866), which constitutes one of the starting points of the present invention, a
web former of a paper machine is described, in particular for modernizations of
Fourdrinier wire parts. This former comprises a lower-wire loop placed in connection
with the headbox of the paper machine and forming a single-wire, usually
horizontal initial portion of the dewatering zone, in which zone water is drained by
means of dewatering members out of the web that is being formed through the lower
wire. The web former comprises an upper-wire unit, in which there is an upper wire
guided by guide and web-forming rolls, which upper wire, together with the run of
the lower wire, forms a twin-wire dewatering zone, which starts at the first forming
roll, which is placed inside the loop of the upper wire and is provided with an open
hollow face. After this, in the twin-wire dewatering zone, inside the loop of the
lower wire, there is a forming shoe, which has a curved deck that guides the lower-wire
loop and whose curve centres or centre are/is placed at the side of the lower-wire
loop. After said forming shoe, inside the loop of the lower wire, there is a
forming roll, which guides the twin-wire forming zone and on whose guide sector
the run of the twin-wire forming zone is curved downwards.Substantially the whole of the twin-wire forming zone in accordance with said FI
Pat. 75,375 is placed above the level determined by the single-wire initial portion,
the twin-wire forming zone being curved upwards from said plane on a sector of the
first forming roll. After the initial dewatering has taken place to a suitable extent 
through the lower wire in the single-wire initial portion, the dewatering takes place
in the
