<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to scanning devices/scanners 
which scan a planar surface and generate a 
signal in response to scanning the planar surface. One 
aspect of the present invention relates to a bar code 
reader for reading and displaying information corresponding 
to a bar code. An important way for storing information is to 
place the information in the form of a bar code appearing 
on a label or the surface of an article. A bar code is 
a coded pattern of a series of bars spaced apart from one 
another by spaces of variable widths, wherein the bars 
and the spaces have different light reflecting 
characteristics. The coded pattern represents various 
information, ranging from merchandise costs to the 
identity of a patient's medications. The information present in the bar code is 
processed by scanning the code with light from a bar code 
reading system. The reflected light is then detected by 
the bar code reading system and electronic circuitry or 
software is employed to decode the detected signal into a 
digital representation of the information represented by 
the bar code. In such bar code reading systems, a bar code is 
commonly read by moving a scanner known as a "wand" 
across the bar code. The "wand" comprises a scanning end 
for reading the bar code. To scan a bar code the "wand" 
is grasped by a person's hand and the scanning end is  
 
moved across the bar code in a process known as 
"wanding." Example of wands are disclosed in U.S. 
Patents Nos. 4,260,979 to Smith; 4,817,185 to Yamaguchi 
et al.; and 5,184,005 to Ukai et al. The wand is 
attached to a processor via a cord so that information 
scanned by the wand from the bar code is sent to the 
processor for producing information. One disadvantage of "wand" scanners is that 
they allow for a multiple number of angular positions for 
a person's wrist to accomplish scanning the bar code. If 
the "wand" is held incorrectly and/or is angled at an 
awkward angle during scanning, a person's wrist will 
experience stress. Furthermore, if a large number of 
wanding strokes are taken by a person while the "wand" is 
held incorrectly or is angled awkwardly, the person may 
experience discomfort during the bar code reading 
process. Another disadvantage of bar code scanners is 
that the multiple number of angular positions for the 
scanner reduces the probability of a successful reading 
of a bar code. Thus, more than one scan of the bar code 
may be needed to read the bar code. Accordingly, it is an object of the present 
invention to
