<ABSTRACT>
A fluid polymer suspension is provided that is stable and
has at least one water soluble polysaccharide in an aaqueous

carrier fluid in which the polysaccharide does not
significantly swell or dissolve where the polysaccharide in

the aqueous carrier fluid has the measured properties of (i)
rendering the polymer(s) insoluble, resulting in a cloudy

suspension, (ii) limiting the swelling of insolubilized
polymer(s), leading to a polymer sediment volume of a

1 weight percent polymer dispersion to less than 15%, and
(iii) preventing phase separation for at least one week.

These suspensions are useful in cosmetics, personal care, and
household applications.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the use of aqueous fluid
suspensions of polysaccharides in cosmetic, personal care and
household applications.Prior to the present invention, processing difficulties
were encountered when dispersing and incorporating dry
polysaccharides, such as methylhydroxypropylcellulose (MHPC)
and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), into water-containing liquid
formulations using conventional methods of dispersion. It is
well known that cellulosic polymers are widely used as
thickening agents in aqueous based liquid formulations, such
as liquid detergents, conditioners, shampoos, liquid hand
soaps, and the like. Known prior art methods to overcome
difficulties during dispersion of the dry MHPC into the
formulation include: dispersion by heating the water to
temperatures of 60-100Â°C; dispersion by slurrying the cellulose
ether in water miscible organic liquids such as alcohol or
glycol; and dispersion by dry blending the cellulosic with
powders. The disadvantages of these methods are the use of
large amounts of energy in the form of heat, and long mixing
cycles, and the presence of inflammable solvents, such as
alcohol, which create the danger of a fire. Still another difficulty encountered in the aforesaid
dispersion methods is the formation of lumps of undissolved
polysaccharide polymer in the aqueous medium which do not
dissolve even after protracted periods of agitation (about 2-3
hours). This lumping problem requires an additional
filtration step to rid the liquid formulation of said
undissolved material. There is also a loss of thickening
power when such undissolved material is filtered from the
solution, which often requires re-work of the formulation.Many prior art references exist that try to alleviate the
above mentioned problems in the use of dry polysaccharide by
using heated water and/or oil phases in order to disperse and
dissolve the polymer prior to the addition to a formulation,
such as for skin conditioning, detergents, shampoos, and the
like. See U.S. Patents Nos. 3,953,591, 3,549,542, 3,998,761,
and 4,174,305.Another approach for solving the above mentioned problems
for incorporating polysaccharide polymers into household
liquid formulations containing water is the use of a pre-mix
of polymers dispersed in a water free liquified organic medium
in which it does not swell or dissolve, prior to its
incorporation into an aqueous formulation, using a short
mixing cycle. This approach was described in U.S. Patent
4,469,627.None of the above prior art references discloses the
incorpora
