A shut-off valve comprising a housing (1), a rotatable shut-off 
disk (6) and an elastic cuff (2) to provide a seal between the shut-off disk 

(6) and the housing (1) for the purpose of shutting off flow and for providing 
a seal between a disk shaft, which extends from the shut-off disk (6) 

through a passage opening in the cuff (2) into a shank of the housing (1), 
and the housing (1), the cuff (2) being provided with a radially external 

collar (3) which extends over part of the cuff (2) in the axial direction 
and is opposite to the shut-off disk (6) placed in the cuff (2) and the 

housing (1) possesses an encircling groove (4) for receiving the collar (3) 
of the cuff (2), characterized in that the collar (3) possesses, in the open 

state of the shut-off disk (6), such a reduced axial width in relation to 
the groove (4) that at least one lateral intermediate space (5 and 5') is 

formed, into which the material of the cuff (2) is thrust at least partially 
out of position when the shut-off disk (6) penetrates the cuff (2) during 

closing. 
The shut-off valve as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the 
elastic cuff engages a seat on the housing (1) and in that the developed 

length of the elastic cuff (2) is larger than the developed length of its 
seat in the housing (1). 
The shut-off valve as claimed in claim 2, characterized in that the 
developed length of the elastic cuff (2) is 0.5 to 1.5 % larger than the 

developed length of its seat in the housing (1). 
The shut-off valve as claimed in any one of the claims 1 through 
3, characterized in that the volume of the material, displaced by the penetrating 

shut-off disk is equal to the volume, present in the open setting 
of the shut-off disk (6), of the intermediate space (5 and 5'). 
The shut-off valve as claimed in any one of the claims 1 through 
4, characterized in that adjacent to the passage opening for the shut-off  

 
disk shaft the collar (3) engages the side wall surfaces of the groove (4) 

of the housing (1) free of play and it is merely in the remaining part that 
it has a smaller width than the groove (4).
