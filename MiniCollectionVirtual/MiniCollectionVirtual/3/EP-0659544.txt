<CLAIMS>
A process for recapping tyres in which, once what
is left of the worn tread has been removed by machining

using known means, and before a new tread (15, 24, 29)
is applied, the surface of the crown (14) and shoulders

(19) of said tyre is treated by application of a high-pressure
water jet to create surface roughness and

eliminate surface particles.
A recapping process according to Claim 1, in
which, once treated, the roughness R
a
 of the surface of
the crown (14) of the carcass (3) is greater than or

equal to 10 micrometres.
A repair process for a tyre having at least one
damaged zone in which, once the degraded materials have

been removed from said damaged zone using known means,
and before an added material or a repair patch is

applied to said damaged zone, the surface of said
damaged zone is treated by application of a high-pressure

water jet to create surface roughness and to
eliminate surface particles.
A process for manufacturing a premoulded,
prevulcanised tread (15, 24, 29), in which, upon

emerging from the vulcanisation mould, a high-pressure
water jet is applied to the surface of the sole (20) of

said tread to create surface roughness.
A process for manufacturing a tread (15, 24, 29)
according to Claim 4, in which the surface treated by

application of a high-pressure water jet includes the
inner (21) and outer (22) edges of the wings (17) of

said tread. 
A process for manufacturing a tread (15, 24, 29)
according to one of Claims 4 or 5, in which the

moulding burrs (23) are cut off from said tread by
means of the high-pressure jet of water.
A process for manufacturing a tyre, in which, once
a prevulcanised tread (15, 24, 29) has been produced,

and a prevulcanised tyre carcass (3), and before
assembly thereof using known means, the surface of the

crown (14) and shoulders (19) of said carcass (3) is
treated by application of a high-pressure water jet to

create surface roughness.
A process for manufacturing a tyre according to
Claim 7, in which said tread (15, 24, 29) is produced

according to the process of one of Claims 5 or 6.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 8, in
which a section of the water jet, normal to the

direction of application of said water jet, has a
substantially elliptical shape with a ratio of the

major axis of the ellipse to the minor axis of the
ellipse of more than 6, and the direction of relative

displacement of said water jet with respect to said
treated surfaces is perpendicular to the major axis of

said ellipse of said section of the water jet.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 9, in
which the admission pressure of said water jet is

between 100 and 250 MPa, and the relative speed of
displacement between said water jet and said treated

surfaces is between 50 and 300 m/min.
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 10, in
which said high-pressure water jet is sprayed on to

said treated surfaces at a distance of between 8 and
20 mm. 
A device for implementing the treatment process
according to one of Claims 1 to 12, in which, using

pressurised water, it comprises a feed line (1) for the
pressurised water, said line ending in a nozzle (2),

and comprises means for support and relative
displacement of said treated surfaces relative to said

nozzle (2), and in which said nozzle (2) has a water
outlet orifice (10) obtained by the intersection of a

cone (8) and a dihedron (9), the axis of said cone (8)
being perpendicular to the 
straight line intersecting
the two planes of said dihedron (9).
A device according to Claim 12, in which a
projection of said outlet orifice (10), in a plane

perpendicular to the axis of said cone (8), has an
elliptical shape with a ratio of the major axis of the

ellipse to the minor axis of the ellipse of the order
of 1.4.
A device according to Claim 12, in which the angle
at the apex of said cone is between 25 and 35° and the

angle of said dihedron (9) is between 65 and 70°.
A device according to one of Claims 13 or 14, in
which the length of the major axis of said ellipse of

said flat projection of said outlet orifice (10) of the
nozzle (2) is between 0.30 and 0.40 mm.
