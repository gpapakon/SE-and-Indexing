<ABSTRACT>
Collagen membranes containing inorganic and/or 
organic agents are useful for various medical 

treatments, e.g. as antibacterial artificial skin. 
The membranes, of high strength, are formed from 

collagen fibres obtained by refining and reconstituting 
collagen which has been treated by the limited 

pepsin digestion process. Suitable organic agents 
include bone forming agents as well as antibacterial 

agents, and suitable inorganic agents include calcium 
phosphate compound as well as antibacterial ceramic. 

The membranes can be laminated to air permeable 
membranes.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to collagen membranes 
containing inorganic agent and having high strength, 
in particular the invention relates to collagen 
membranes having high strength and being formed from 
collagen fibres obtained by refining and reconstituting 
collagen which have been treated by the limited 
pepsin digestion process and also this invention 
relates to a gradually releasing formulation, in which 
an organic agent is contained in the collagen 
membrane formed from collagen fibres obtained by 
refining and reconstituting collagen which has been 
treated by the limited pepsin digestion process. 
Suitable inorganic and/or organic agents include bone 
forming agents, antibacterial agents, calcium phosphate 
compound and antibacterial ceramic. The collagen 
membranes can be laminated to air permeable membranes. It is well known that collagen membranes can 
be used for medical treatment of conditions such as 
skin burns, defects of tooth bone, remineralization 
of tooth cement and bone fractures. However, when 
the collagen membranes are used, bacterial infections  
 
in the injury and burying portions, in which the 
collagen membranes are used, become the serious 
problems. Then during the medical treatments, the 
antibacterial agents and antibiotics are coated on 
the collagen membranes to prevent the bacteria 
infections, and as shown in the Japanese Patent 
Publication No. Sho 58-41054, the collagen membrane 
is used by immobilizing the antibiotics on the 
surface of collagen membrane. However, when the 
chemical agents are coated on the collagen membrane, 
the permeability of the chemical agent becomes a 
problem and when the antibiotics are immobilized on 
the collagen membrane, the problems, such as the 
effective time period of antibiotics and the tolerant 
bacteria, may occur. Meantime, the collagen membranes are difficultly 
used by oneself due to a weak strength. The 
artificial skin is shown by the Japanese Patent Laid-Open 
Publication No. Hei 3-182262, in which the resin 
containing aluminosilicate containing silver is coated 
on the sheet suitable to living body, and also the 
method of using collagen membrane is taught by Japanese 
Patent Publication No. Sho 58-52662, in which collagen 
is adhered to an air permeable based material. 
However, the method disclosed in the former is a 
possible problem for safety, because the surface 
contacting the skin is the resin layer. Also, the  
 
experiments, by which the bones are introduced to 
the defect portions and the fractures of bone,
