<ABSTRACT>
A mixture of a carbon-based hydrophobic base fluid, an 
electrorheologically active solid particle, and an aromatic 

hydroxy compound substituted with a hydrocarbyl group 
containing at least about 6 carbon atoms shows good dispersion 

characteristics and good electrorheological activity.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to electrorheological 
fluids and devices, and a method for improving the dispersive 
stability of such fluids. Electrorheological ("ER") fluids are fluids which can 
rapidly and reversibly vary their apparent viscosity in the 
presence of an applied electric field. ER fluids are 
generally dispersions of finely divided solids in hydrophobic, 
electrically non-conducting oils. They have the 
ability to change their flow characteristics, even to the 
point of becoming solid, when subjected to a sufficiently 
strong electrical field. When the field is removed, the 
fluids revert to their normal liquid state. ER fluids may 
be used in applications in which it is desired to control 
the transmission of forces by low electric power levels, 
for example, in clutches, hydraulic valves, shock absorbers, 
vibrators, or systems used for positioning and holding 
work pieces in position. ER fluids have been known since 1947, when U.S. Patent 
2,417,850 was issued to Winslow, disclosing that certain 
dispersions of finely divided solids such as starch, 
carbon, limestone, gypsum, flour, etc., dispersed in a non-conducting 
liquid would undergo an increase in flow resistance 
when an electrical potential difference was applied. 
In the extensive work which has followed this discovery, 
many variations of ER fluids have been discovered, in which 
the solid phase, the liquid phase, or other components have 
been varied. One feature of many ER fluids is that a 
dispersant (also referred to as a surfactant) is required 
in order to maintain the finely divided solids dispersed 
through the liquid medium. The use of a dispersant, 
however, has been reported to lead to diminished electrorheological 
activity in some systems.  
 Among the various attempts to provide an improved ER 
fluid are the following: Japanese application 03/170600 (Tonen Corp.), July 24, 
1991, discloses an electro-viscous fluid comprising an 
electric insulating fluid, porous solid particles, a 
dispersant, and a polyhydric alcohol. The dispersants can 
include sulfonates, phenates, phosphonates, succinimides, 
amine, and nonionic dispersants including e.g. sorbitan 
monooleate. Japanese application 04/120194 (Tonen Corp.), April 
21, 1992 (available as Derwent Abstract 92-180972/22), 
discloses electroviscous fluid containing at least one of 
partially etherified and esterified products of polyhydric 
alcohols in a base electroviscous fluid consisting of an 
electrically insulating fluid, porous solid particles, and 
disp
