<ABSTRACT>
In order to minimize the size of the spring (22) and the pump motor in a high-pressure cleaning device with a high-pressure pump which pumps cleaning fluid from an intake line (1) into a pressure line (6) leading to a discharge device, with a by-pass line (18) from the pressure line (6) to the intake line (1), with a valve body (19) closing off the outlet aperture (8) between the pressure line (6) and the by-pass line (18), with an actuating component (20) for the valve body (19) which can be moved against the pressure of a spring (22) against the valve body (19) into a position setting said valve to the open position, and with a working cylinder (9) divided by a sealed piston (10) movable therein and coupled to the actuating component into two chambers (11, 12), one of which is arranged between the discharge aperture (19) and the by-pass line (18) and the other is connected via a control line (13) to the pressure line, it is proposed that the control line (13) leaves the pressure line (6) in the region of a waist (15) therein.

<CLAIMS>
A high-pressure cleaning apparatus having a high-pressure pump which pumps cleaning 
fluid from a suction line (1) into a pressure line (6) leading to a discharge device, having 

a by-pass line (18) leading from the pressure line to the suction line, having a valve body 
(19) closing the outlet (8) between the pressure line and the by-pass line, having an 

actuating member for the valve body, this actuating member being movable - against the 
action of a spring - against the valve body into a position displacing the latter into the 

open position, and having a working cylinder (9) divided into two chambers by means of 
a piston (10) which is coupled to the actuating member and is displaceable within the 

working cylinder (9) in a sealed manner, one chamber being arranged between the outlet 
(8) and the by-pass line (18) and the other being connected to the pressure line (1[sic]
) 
via a control line (13), characterised in that the control line (13) issues from the pressure 

line (6) in the region of a cross-sectional reduction (15) thereof. 
A high-pressure cleaning apparatus in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the 
cross-sectional reduction (15) is formed by an injector (14) which sucks up chemicals. 
A high-pressure cleaning apparatus in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that 
a non-return valve (7) is arranged in the pressure line (6), between the outlet (8) of the 

by-pass line (18) and the issue of the control line (13). 
A high-pressure cleaning apparatus in accordance with any one of the preceding Claims, 
characterised in that a non-return valve (32) opening in the discharge direction is 

arranged in the pressure line (6), downstream of the cross-sectional reduction (15). 
A high-pressure cleaning apparatus in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that a pressure reservoir (30) is provided and is connected to the pressure 

line (6) via a connecting line (31) issuing into the latter upstream of the cross-sectional 
reduction (15).
