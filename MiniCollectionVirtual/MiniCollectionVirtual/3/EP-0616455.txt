<ABSTRACT>
Computers are linked together to form a network. Messages are sent 
over the links between the computers in compressed, segmented form, the 

size of the segments being appropriate to the transmission characteristics 
of the link. A message previously received or transmitted by a computer is 

stored in compressed and segmented form. If it is desired to forward or retransmit 
this message, the segment size of the stored form is compared 

against the optimum segment size for the link over which the message is to 
be sent. If there is a close match, then the stored segmented, compressed 

message is retrieved for direct transmittal, without having to resegment or 
recompress the message.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to operating a computer in a network,
in which messages are transmitted to and from the computer over links with
other computers in the network.It is becoming increasingly common for individual computer systems
to be linked together into networks to allow information to be communicated
between them. There are several main types of network including an
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), which is based on telephone
lines, and local area networks (LANs). Before data is transmitted over the
network from one computer to another, the data ususally first undergoes
some form of compression to reduce the volume to be sent, and is then
formatted into one or more segments (often known as packets). Each
segment typically contains, in addition to the basic data to be transmitted,
address information, error checking (eg parity or CRC checks), flag fields
identifying the start and end of the message, and so on. When a segment is
received by a computer, the flag fields, check bytes, and so on are
stripped out. The segments are then re-assembled and decompressed in
order to recover the original data.The extra information and processing associated with a segment
means that there is a certain fixed overhead per segment, independent of
segment size, so that it is most efficient to use as large a segment size as
possible to transmit a given message. However, each segment is downloaded
whole onto the network and during this time, known as latency, no other
messages can be inserted onto the link, even if they have a higher priority
than the message being downloaded. Thus latency effectively represents
the period when the terminal is unavailable to send other messages, and so
it is desirable to restrict segment size to prevent too long a latency. Since
for a link of a given bandwidth the latency increases with segment size in
line with the time taken to download the message, the optimum segment size
is a compromise between avoiding the overheads associated with many small 
segments whilst minimising latency. As a result, higher bandwidth
networks have larger optimum segment sizes.If a computer decides to forward the data in a message to another
computer in the network, all the compression, segmentation, addressing
and so on must be repeated before the data can be re-transmitted over the
network. In the past, such repetition of the compression and segmentation
has not been a noticeable problem, primarily because most communications
have been point-to-point (ie between two directly

<CLAIMS>
A method of operating a computer in a network, including the steps
of:


transmitting messages to and from the computer over links with other
computers in the network;
processing messages before sending from an original form into a form
suitable for transmission; and
processing messages on receipt back into the original form;

   said method being characterised by the steps of:

storing a message transmitted to or from the computer in either the
transmitted form, or a form intermediate between the original form and the

transmitted form;
retrieving the stored message and processing it if necessary into a
form suitable for transmission;
and sending the retrieved message to another computer.
The method of claim 1, wherein the step of processing the message
from the original form into a form suitable for transmission includes

compressing the message, and said step of storing comprises storing the
message in compressed form.
The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein the step of processing the
message from the original form into a form suitable for transmission includes

segmenting the message, and said step of storing comprises storing the
message in segmented form.
The method of claim 3, further comprising the step of determining
whether a stored message has a segment size appropriate for the link over

which the message is to be transmitted.
The method of claim 4, wherein it is determined whether a stored
message has a segment size appropriate for the link based on the time

required to re-segment the message relative to the delay that would be
incurred by using a non-optimum segment size. 
The method of claim 5, further including the step of monitoring the
current performance of the network in order to determine the optimum

segment size for each link.
The method of any preceding claim, further comprising the step of
deleting a stored message if it is decided not to forward the message to

another computer.
The method of any preceding claim, further comprising the step of
also storing the message in original form, and wherein each processed form

of the message is stored in a linked chain appended to the stored original
form of the message.
A computer (10) adapted for inclusion in a network, wherein messages are
transmitted to and from the computer over links with other computers in the

network, messages being processed before sending from an original form
into a form suitable for transmission, and being processed on receipt back

into the original form; and characterised by:

means (20) for storing a message transmitted to or from the computer in
either the transmitted form, or a form intermediate between the original form and

the transmitted form;
means for retrieving the stored message and processing it if
necessary into a form suitable for transmission;
and means for sending the retrieved message to another computer.
The computer of claim 9, including means for compressing the
message in order to process the message from the original form into a form

suitable for transmission, the message being stored in compressed form.
The computer of claim 9 or claim 10, including means for segmenting
the message in order to process the message from the original form into a

form suitable for transmission, the message being stored in segmented
form. 
The computer of claim 11, further including means for determining
whether a stored message has a segment size appropriate for the link over

which the message is to be transmitted.
The computer of claim 12, further including means for monitoring the
current performance of the network in order to determine the optimum

segment size for each link.
The computer of any of claims 9 to 13, further comprising means for
deleting a stored message if it is decided not to forward the message to

another computer.
A method of transmitting data to a subset of a network of computers
as claimed in any of claims 9 to 14, said method comprising the steps of:


transmitting a first message specifying the subset of the network to
which the data is to be transmitted; and
transmitting a second message containing the data, whereby
receiving workstations can use the information in the first message to

forward the second message to another computer in the network without
having to first process the second message back into its original form.
