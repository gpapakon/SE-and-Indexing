<ABSTRACT>
A process for sealing a catheter to an insertion needle 
comprises: 


a) positioning a tubular polymer catheter over a 
concentric insertion needle; 
b) rotating said catheter and needle about a 
longitudinal axis thereof at a predetermined position; 
c) impinging a laser light at a predetermined angle 
upon the catheter and needle subassembly, said laser light 

being of sufficient power to partially melt said polymer 
material to form a frustoconical tip to the tubular material 

with at least a portion of said polymer material adhering 
said tubular catheter to a surface of said needle, creating 

a seal between said tubular catheter material and said 
needle.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and apparatus
for forming catheter products and particularly to a method
and apparatus for beveling the tip of intravenous
catheters while sealing the catheter to its insertion
needle.Intravenous catheters come substantially in two types of
products. The first type is a through-the-needle catheter
product wherein the catheter that is to be disposed within
the vein is inserted through a sharpened cannula. The
cannula is used to pierce the skin and insert the catheter
and later is removed. However, this type of catheter has
not met with much commercial success do to inherent flaws
in the through-the-needle type delivery system. For
example, the needle must be larger in diameter than the
catheter being inserted. Therefore, the needle creates a
larger opening on insertion than the catheter requires and
creates a greater chance of leakage. Furthermore, it is
difficult to remove and dispose of the needle or cannula
once the catheter has been inserted.The second and more common type of intravenous catheters
is the over-the-needle catheter. In this type of product
a needle or cannula has disposed thereover a catheter.
The catheter is disposed such that the sharpened tip of
the needle is extending from the catheter product and is
used to pierce the patient's skin and insert the catheter.
Once the skin and vein have been pierced, the catheter is
threaded off of the needle and the needle is removed from
the catheter product. In order to ease the insertion of the over-the-needle type
catheter products, it has long been known to bevel the tip
of the catheter to provide a smooth transition between the
surface or outer diameter of the needle or cannula and the
surface or outer diameter of the catheter itself during
the insertion process. There have been many methods
developed for beveling the tips of catheters. For
example, U.S. Patent No. 4,661,300 to Daugherty entitled
"Method and Apparatus for Flashless Tipping of an I.V.
Catheter" discloses a process which was used in the early
1980's to mold a beveled tip on a catheter while
simultaneously trimming the flash in order to provide a
clean edge to the tip. This process, however, requires a
high cost in retooling because of the wear interface
between the two tool members and the cleaning necessary to
unclog the mold from the trimmed flash.Catheters have also been provided with what is actually a
duel bevel. The bevel begins gently at approximately 3°
and then is sharper right at the tip, for example 27°. The
sharper bevel is

A process for sealing a catheter to an insertion needle
comprising:


a) positioning a tubular polymer catheter over a
concentric insertion needle;
b) rotating said catheter and needle about a
longitudinal axis thereof at a predetermined position;
c) impinging a laser light at a predetermined angle
upon the catheter and needle subassembly, said laser light

being of sufficient power to partially melt said polymer

with at least a portion of said polymer material adhering
said tubular catheter to a surface of said needle, creating

a seal between said tubular catheter material and said
needle.
The process according to claim 1 wherein the catheter
is sealed to the needle in an amount which provides a

resistance to removal of the catheter tube from the needle
of less than 400 gms.
The process according to claim 1 or claim 2 wherein said
seal is sufficient to substantially prevent the flow of

blood between said tubular catheter and said needle at said
tip during insertion of said catheter into a patient.
The process according to any one of claims 1 to 3
wherein said catheter is preformed with a bevel thereon and

said predetermined angle is approximately 90° to trim flash
from the molding process while simultaneously sealing said

catheter to said needle.
The process of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein said
predetermined angle is between 10° and 40°.
The process according to claim 5 wherein said
predetermined angle is approximately 27°.
