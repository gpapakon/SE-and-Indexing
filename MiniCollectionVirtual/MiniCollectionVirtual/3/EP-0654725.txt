<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism (30) for controlling the pivotal positioning of 
a hydraulic control lever (22) on a tractor (10) is disclosed 

wherein a gated plate (25) is affixed to the control lever (22) 
to be pivotally moveable therewith into selective engagement with 

a lockout pin (35) projecting outwardly from a pivoted actuating 
lever (32). The gated plate (25) has first and second gates (26, 

27) for selectively receiving the lockout pin (35) when in a 
first position to restrict the pivotal movement of said control 

lever (22) in preselected manners. The gated plate (25) further 
includes a stop (28) engageable with the lockout pin (35) when in 

a second position to prevent the control lever (22) from being 
placed in a float position. A third selectable position of said 

actuating lever (32) places the lockout pin (35) out of 
engagement with said gated plate (25) to allow an unrestricted 

freedom of movement of the control lever (22). The pivoted 
control lever (22) and the pivoted actuating lever (32) project 

outwardly through a control panel (20) for manipulation thereof.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to control levers used on
machinery such as agricultural tractors to operate hydraulic
devices and, more particularly, to a mechanism cooperable with
the control lever to limit the movement thereof and, thereby,
restrict the operation of the corresponding hydraulic device.A rotatable position control apparatus of the above type is
disclosed in US-A-4.548.094. This apparatus is in the form of a
cylinder having notches formed therein to engage the control
lever passing therethrough and limit the movement of the control
lever in accordance with the notch aligned with the control
lever. The cylinder is provided with a thumb wheel member that
projects upwardly through the control panel for rotation by the
operator to select the respective notch to be aligned with the
control lever.However, to improve the manipulation by the operator to
select the various modes of operation of the hydraulic system, it
would be desirable to provide an alternative control lever
position control mechanism having a more positively engageable
pivotal actuation lever. Furthermore, it would be desirable to
provide an alternative position control mechanism that would be
operable to select a greater range of hydraulic system modes of
operation.The arrangement of US-A-5.062.316 which comprises the features of the preamble of claim 1 already fulfils some of
the above demands, however suffers from the disadvantage that for
selecting certain hydraulic system modes three different levers
have to be manipulated, which complicates the use of the
arrangement for an operator.It is therefore the objective of the present invention to
provide a pivotable lockout means which is more positively
engageable than the known prior art arrangements and which
enables a greater variety of operative modes for the operation of
the associated hydraulic system in a simple manner. According to the present invention a position control
mechanism for a pivotally movable control lever is provided
comprising :
a pivotable actuating lever having a lockout pin
projecting outwardly therefrom, and a gated plate pivotally movable with said control lever,
said gated plate including a first gate engageable with said
lockout pin when said actuating lever is in a first position to
fix said control lever in a neutral mode. The position control mechanism is characterized in that :
said gated plate further comprises :
a second elongated gate alternatively engageable with said
lockout pin when said actuating lever is in said first position
to fix

<CLAIMS>
A position control mechanism (30) for a pivotally
movable control lever (22) comprising :


a pivotable actuating lever (32) having a
lockout pin (35) projecting outwardly therefrom, and
a gated plate (25) pivotally movable with said
control lever (22), said gated plate (25) including a first

gate (26) engageable with said lockout pin (35) when said
actuating lever (22) is in a first position to fix said

control lever (22) in a neutral mode; and

   characterized in that :

said gated plate (25) further comprises :

a second elongated gate (27) alternatively
engageable with said lockout pin (35) when said actuating

lever (32) is in said first position to fix said control
lever (22) in a hydraulic motor mode; and
a stop (28) engageable with said lockout pin
(35) when said actuating lever (32) is in a second position

to restrain the pivotal movement of said control lever (22)
from being positioned in a float mode; and
said lockout pin (35) is positionable out of
engagement with said gated plate (25) when said actuating

lever (32) is in a third position to allow said control
lever (22) an unrestricted freedom of movement.
A position control mechanism (30) according to
claim 1 characterized in that said control lever (22) is

operatively connected to a hydraulic system for selectively
placing said hydraulic system in a first mode in which

movement of hydraulic fluid through said hydraulic system is
effected only in a first direction, in a second mode in

which movement of said hydraulic fluid through said
hydraulic system is effected only in a second direction, in 

said neutral mode in which said hydraulic fluid is prevented
from movement within said hydraulic system, and in said

float mode in which said hydraulic fluid is free to move
through said hydraulic system in either said first or said

second direction.
A position control mechanism (30) according to
claim 2 characterized in that, in said hydraulic motor mode,

said control lever (22) is selectively movable between said
first mode and said float mode.
A position control mechanism (30) according to any
of the preceding claims characterized in that said control

lever (22) and the corresponding said actuating lever (32)
project outwardly for pivotal manipulation thereof through

a control panel (20) having a first slotted opening (24) to
permit movement of said control lever (22) and an adjacent

second slotted opening (34) for accommodating the movement
of the corresponding actuating lever (32).
A position control mechanism (30) according to any
of the preceding claims characterized in that said actuating

lever (32) is provided with a detent member (45) cooperable
with a retention assembly (40) having three notches (41, 42,

43) formed therein, said retention assembly (40) and said
actuating lever (32) being urged into engagement so that

said detent member (45) is restrained within one of said
notches (41, 42, 43) corresponding to the selected position

of sai d actuating lever (32).
A position control mechanism (30) according to
claim 4 characterized in that said second slotted opening 

(34) is formed with three detention notches (36, 37, 38)
corresponding to the three positions of said actuating lever

(32), said actuating lever (32) being spring-loaded toward
engagement with said detention notches (36, 37, 38) and each

said detention notch (36, 37, 38) being operable to retain
said actuation lever (32) in the selected position.
