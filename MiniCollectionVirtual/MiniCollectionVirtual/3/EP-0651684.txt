<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns an apparatus and a processs for soldering components (34, 26) onto boards (180, with at least one preheating zone (10) and one soldering zone (12) as well as a transport device (16) by means of which the boards (18) can be moved from one zone (10) to the next. It is proposed that in the preheating zone (10) infrared radiators (22) are arranged to extend in the direction of transport (20) and in the soldering zone (12) infrared radiators are arranged to extend diagonally to the direction of transport (20), with the radiation striking the board surface essentially at a slant. As a result, less radiation is absorbed at the board surface and at the surfaces of the components (34, 36) than at the lateral walls of the appropriate components (34, 38). It is further proposed that soldering ovens are adjusted using sensors (54, 56) mounted on test boards (18') and in the oven (10, 12).
