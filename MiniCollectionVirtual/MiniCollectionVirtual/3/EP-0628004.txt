part (2), which is open on top and over the greater part of 

its front and which has a continuous bottom panel, and a 
removable cover part (3) which covers the open sides of the 

lower part (2), the lower part (2) being erected from a 
one-piece blank and the cover part (3), which is erected 

from a one-piece corrugated board blank (3a), comprising a 
die-cut upper panel (9) - corresponding to the lower part 

(2) in its width (B) and length (L) - and a front panel 
(11) hinged thereto as a linear extension along a transverse 

crease (10) and erected at a right angle to the upper 
panel (9) with a width (B) corresponding to the width (B) 

of the lower part and a length corresponding to the height 
(H) of the lower part, the corrugations (12) of the corrugated 

board blank (3a) extending at right angles to the 
transverse crease (10), and narrow side flaps (17-20) 

erected at right angles being hinged on both sides along 
the longitudinal edges of the upper and front panels (9,11) 

of the cover part and glued to the adjoining side panel 
(7,6) of the lower part (2), characterized in that, when 

the transportation pack (1) is open, the front side panel 
(4) is distinctly smaller in height (H₁) than the other side 

panels (5-7); in that each of the four side panels (4-7) 
has a hinged bottom lap (5a-7) and one side panel (6) has 

a glue lap (8) and in that a tear-open lap (25-28) is

corresponding tear-open lap (25-28). 
A transportation pack as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the transverse crease (10) is adjoined 

along both longitudinal edges by regions (29,30) with no 
side flap which correspond in length to at least the width  

 
(B₁ of the side flaps (17-20). 
A transportation pack as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
characterized in that mutually opposite tear-open flaps 

(25,26;27,28) are arranged offset relative to one another.
