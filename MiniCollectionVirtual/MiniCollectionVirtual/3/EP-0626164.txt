<DESCRIPTION>
The present specification refers to a patent of invention 
concerning an intelligent treatment and control unit applicable 
in processes for the sequential treatment and follow up 
of patients in hydromassage bathtubs or similar, the evident 
purpose of which is to constitute per se an exhaustive control 
nexus of a patient or patients, who are treated by immersion 
and massage inside a bathtub or hydromassage basin, which is 
necessary to perform the curative treatment of the illness 
they suffer, being subjected and identified all the time to an 
exhaustive control of their constants from the same moment of 
effecting the beggining of the treatment, a communication being 
carried out all the time with a central unit storing the treated 
patient data, and, at the same time, shots or films of the - 
treatment operation are obtained, this central unit and the zone 
where the treatment is performed having alarm and anomaly detectors 
which could arise during the patient stay in the treatment 
zone, said unit detecting any marginal circumstance, and 
predetermining the treatment to be followed according to the variables 
so obtained and later checked. This invention will find application in the medicine field. At present, nothing is known about the existence of different 
applications based on the computer science, efficiently utilized 
within the medicine field. To enumerate the different applications of the computing systems 
in the medicine and electromedicine field would be a fully 
ardous task, and, of course, on the lines of the large amount of 
applications employed up to now, some aspect would remain always  
 
not contemplated. Nevertheless, in the medicine field dealing in an effective 
manner with some physical sufferings by the application of 
baths by immersion, it is known, in a totally trite way, the use 
very long time ago, of baths by immersion of patients in traditional 
health resorts, which according to the characteristics and 
nature of their waters, could, if not totally cure the patient, 
at least to temporarily alleviate partial o fully the patients 
sufferings. In conventional health resorts, it was considered, and it is 
still considered,the patient immersion either in water baths 
in the strict sense, or in basins in which muds were deposited in 
advance, which, as per their characteristics, could also alleviate 
in the most part, the sufferings of the patients. Later, it was found that, when a patient immersed himself in 
a basin having a water stream, the qualities of the bath
