<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides an apparatus and method for inspecting and handling devices that are semi-constrained in trays (12). The trays (12) are transported through various inspection and handling stages, such as laser scanning (200), inversion (300), camera scanning (400) and individual placement (450) at a final destination so that devices meeting the exacting standards for acceptable devices are separated from those devices which do not meet such standards. The transport of trays (12) is along a linear path and the inversion of the devices in the trays (12) is accomplished above the linear path.

 "INSPECTION HANDLER APPARATUS AND METHOD"RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of 35 U.S.C. ยง119 of co-pending provisional patent applications 60/052,698, filed July 16, 1997 and 60/073,885, filed February 6, 1998.FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to an apparatus and method for inspecting and handling devices that are semi-constrained in compartmented trays . More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus and method for conveying devices contained in trays to and through multiple inspection and handling stations.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Semiconductor devices such as integrated circuit chips need to be precisely fabricated since exact precision is required to insure that such devices have an exact predetermined geometry. Although such fabrication produces high quality results, defective devices are fabricated that have geometry variations in coplanarity, span and sweep as well as mark defects in content, legibility, contrast, orientation and quality, which are outside tolerances for acceptable devices. Accordingly, inspection of the devices is necessary to ascertain whether the devices meet exacting acceptance standards. The inspection stages generally include both camera and laser inspections.The semiconductor devices to be inspected are typically provided in compartmented trays which have multiple rows and columns of pockets into which the devices are placed. Trays typically hold between 50 and 100 devices, and the trays are often configured to be stackable.Machines of the type to which this invention relates have been used in the past. In that regard it has been proposed to cycle a tray loaded with 

semiconductors from an input module through intervening inspection modules and a pick-and-place module to an outfeed module, and to achieve an inversion of the semiconductors between the inspection modules. A desire in connection with such machines is ongoing to increase the speed and reliability of processing the semiconductors and to do so without complicating the structure or system.Accordingly, among the objects of this invention are to improve the speed and reliability of the inspection and/or otherwise processing of such semiconductors and to do so without complicating either the machine's structure or the process.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONFor the achievement of these and other objects, this invention proposes to transport trays loaded with semiconductor devices through the infeed, inspection, pick-and-place (PNP) and outfeed modules, and an inverter
