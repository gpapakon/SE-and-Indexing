<ABSTRACT>
In rhinostereometry, which is an optical method for measuring the congestion of the nasal mucosa, it has to be possible to repeatedly and with high accuracy fix the test subject's head in the same position in a coordinate system. This can be achieved by means of a fixing device comprising a plurality of pressure transducers (6-10) which are brought into contact with the test subject's head in such a manner that the head exerts at least a predetermined minimum pressure on all the transducers. Because the fixing device includes means for recording the positions of the pressure transducers in the coordinate system, the test subject's head can be repeatedly fixed in the same position.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for fixing a person's
head in a coordinate system. An example of such devices
is given in US-A-3 614 950.Rhinostereometry is an optical method used for measuring
the congestion of the nasal mucosa. The head of the
person to be subjected to such measuring is fixed in a
coordinate system. The positions in the coordinate system
of a number of points on the nasal mucosa are determined
by means of a surgical microscope which is placed on a
micrometer table and is movable in all three dimensions.In order for rhinostereometry to repeatedly yield
comparable results, the head of the person subjected to
such measuring has to be fixed in the same position on
different occasions. Accurate fixation is of the utmost
importance, since a point on the nasal mucosa moves about
4 mm at the most when the mucosa changes from a state of
minimum congestion to one of maximum congestion.The object of the invention is to provide a device
enabling repeated and highly accurate fixation of a person's
head in a coordinate system.This object is achieved by a device having the distinctive
features recited in appended claim 1. With the
inventive device, a person's head can be fixed time after
time in the same position in the coordinate system by setting
the pressure transducers in previously recorded positions
in the coordinate system and ensuring that each
transducer is acted on by a predetermined pressure from
the person's head.Fixation is facilitated and can be done more quickly
if the pressure transducers are disposed on a common support
means which is movably arranged on a frame and thus
can be used for roughly positioning the pressure transducers. The support means has the shape of a
spectacle frame, two pressure transducers being arranged
as pad bridges. In fixation, the pad bridges of the support
means are moved downwards over the nasal bone as when
glasses are put on.Preferably, the remaining pressure transducers on the
support means are so arranged as to be contacted with the
forehead as well as the head close to the eyes during
fixation. This arrangement of the pressure transducers is
advantageous, in that the skull is here close beneath the
skin, enabling more accurate fixation.An embodiment of the invention will now be described
in detail with reference to the accompanying drawing, in
which
Fig. 1 schematically illustrates an embodiment of a
fixing device according to the invention; andFig. 2 is an example of a pressure transducer to be
used in the inventive device.Thus, Fig. 1 shows an

<CLAIMS>
A device for fixing a person's head in a coordinate
system, comprising a plurality of pressure transducers

(6-10) which are movable in the coordinate system
and adapted to be contacted with the person's head when

fixing this in the coordinate system, and means associated
with each of the pressure transducers for detecting

when the transducers are acted on by at least one
predetermined pressure from the person's head, said plurality

of pressure transducers being disposed on a support
means (5) which is movably mounted on a frame (3)

fixedly arranged in the coordinate system, 
characterised

in that the device further comprises means
(25) for recording the positions of the pressure transducers

in the coordinate system, and that the support
means (5) has the shape of a spectacle frame, two pressure

transducers (6, 7) being arranged as pad bridges to
be contacted with the nasal bone.
A device as set forth in claim 1, 
characterised

in that a pressure transducer (8) is so
positioned on the support means as to be contacted with

the person's forehead during fixation, and that two pressure
transducers (9, 10) are so positioned on the support

means as to be contacted with the person's head close to
the eyes.
A device as set forth in any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterised
 in that the detecting
means of the pressure transducers (6-10) are connected

to an indicator means indicating when all the transducers
are acted on by at least the predetermined pressure.
