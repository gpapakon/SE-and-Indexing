<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to certain azoxycyanobenzodioxane 
derivatives, processes for their preparation, compositions 
containing such compounds and their use as fungicides. EP-A-0371560 discloses a method of combating a fungus, and/or 
bacterium, and/or yeast, and/or nematode, at a locus which 
comprises treating the locus with a compound of the general formula 
in which R² and R³ together, or R³ and R⁴ together, represent an 
optionally substituted hydrocarbyloxy chain; the ring is optionally 
substituted at any or each of the remaining sites R⁵, R⁶ and R² or 
R⁴; n represents 0 or 1; and X represents a cyano group, a group 
-COOH or a salt, ester or amido derivative thereof. The term 
"hydrocarbyloxy chain" is used to denote a carbon atom chain 
interrupted within the chain by one or more (but preferably one 
only) oxygen atom. In each of the examples, the hydrocarbyloxy 
chain contains only one oxygen atom and this is located at one end 
of the chain. EP-A-0518436 discloses compounds of the general formula 
in which m is 0 or 1; each of R¹ and R², and R³ and R⁴ if present, 
independently represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or an 
optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group, or R¹ and 
R² together or R³ and R⁴ together represent an optionally 
substituted alkylene chain; X represents a cyano group, a group 
-COOH or a salt, ester or amido derivative thereof; Y represents an 
alkyl group or a halogen atom; and n represents 0, 1, 2 or 3; and 
their use as fungicides. It has now been discovered that certain azoxycyanol,-1,3-benzodioxane 
derivatives exhibit good activity against certain 
phytopathogenic fungi. According to the present invention there is therefore provided 
a compound of general formula 
in which n is 0, 1 or 2; each R, if present, independently 
represents a halogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl or 
alkoxy group; R¹ represents a hydrogen atom or a haloalkyl group; 
and R² and R³ independently represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl 
or haloalkyl group. When the compounds of this invention contain an alkyl group, 
this may be linear or branched and may contain up to 12, preferably 
up to 6 and especially up to 4, carbon atoms. When any of the foregoing substituents are designated as being 
optionally substituted, the substituent groups which are optionally 
present may be any one or more of those customarily employed in the 
development of pesticidal compounds, and/or the modification of 
such compounds to influence their structure/ activity, persistence, 
penetration
