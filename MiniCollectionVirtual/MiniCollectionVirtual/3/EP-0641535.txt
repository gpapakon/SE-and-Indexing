<ABSTRACT>
The protecting and heat retaining hood for food has two braces (1, 2) which are preferably bent in the shape of a semicircle and are hingedly connected at their ends. These braces can be pivoted relative to one another from 0 DEG  to a maximum of 180 DEG . Arranged between the two braces (1, 2) is a bellows (4), so that in the pivoted-apart state of the braces (1, 2) a bellows-like vault is formed. In a variant, the protecting and heat retaining hood has a continuous base (14) in the form of a serving plate, for example, on which the braces lie in the use position. A carrying bow (13) made of a round bar or a tube is hung onto the hinges (5, 6) of the braces. This bow locks into a notch or a slot on the hinge when under carrying loading, so that it is no longer pivotable with respect to the base.

<CLAIMS>
A protective and warming bonnet for food comprising two curved braces 
(1,2) which are connected at their ends by hinges and can be pivoted from 

0° to a maximum of 180° in relation to one another, and a folding bellows (4) 
disposed between the two curved braces (1,2) which, when the braces (1,2) 

are pivoted apart, opens out like a pair of bellows to form a dome, 
characterized in that the curved braces (1,2) are punched metal sheets with 

an L-shaped cross-sectional profile, whose flat surfaces are bent upwards at 
their ends in the region of the hinges so that the upward-bent section (22) 

and the flat surface of the brace (1,2) form an angle of approximately 45°, 
and in that the braces (1,2) each have a handle (20) in the polar region and 

the L-profiles of the braces (1,2) in the polar region have a slot-shaped 
opening (24), and also in that the folding bellows is made from paper and is 

replaceable, there being cardboard strips (21) glued to both edges of the 
folding bellows, whose ends can be inserted under the upward-bent sections 

(22) of the braces (1,2) in the region of the hinges and a projecting tongue 
(23) in both polar regions of the cardboard strips (21) which, if the cardboard 

strip is slightly bent, can be inserted into the slot-shaped opening (24) in the 
braces (1,2) so that it engages securely once the cardboard strip is relaxed. 
The protective and warming bonnet for food of claim 1, characterized in that 
it has a continuous base (14) on which the braces rest when in use, with the 

hinge being rigidly connected with the base (14), and in that there is a  
 

carrying handle (13) made from round steel or a tube, which fits into the 
hinge (5,6) and, when used for carrying a load, engages in a notch or a slot 

in the hinge so that it can no longer be pivoted in relation to the base (14). 
The protective and warming bonnet for food of claim 1 or 2, characterized in 
that one of the braces (1) is secured to a base plate or serving platter 

(10,11) whilst the other can be freely pivoted onto the opposite side of the 
base plate or serving platter (10,11) as the folding bellows (4) unfolds. 
The protective and warming bonnet for food of claim 1, characterized in that 
several pivotable gripping arms (15) are attached to the braces (1,2) for the 

purpose of being pivoted underneath a plate positioned under the bonnet 
such that the latter plus the bonnet can be carried by the former.
