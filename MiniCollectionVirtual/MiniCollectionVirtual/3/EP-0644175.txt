<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a novel lubricating oil composition for
compression-type refrigerators,
a novel use of a polyvinyl ether
compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to a
lubricating oil composition for compression-type refrigerators which comprises
a polyvinyl ether compound having
excellent compatibility with hydrogen-containing Flon compounds ["a
Flon compound" means a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), a hydrofluorocarbon
(HFC) and a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) in general], such
as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (referred to as Flon 134a, hereinafter) and
the like, which can be used as the refrigerant to replace compounds
causing environmental pollution, such as dichlorofluoroethane (referred
to as Flon 12, hereinafter) and the like, and having an excellent
lubricating property. Compression-type refrigerators are generally constituted of a
compressor, a condenser, an expansion valve and an evaporator and has
a structure that mixed fluid of a refrigerant and a lubricating oil is
circulated in the closed system. Depending on the type of machinery, in
the compression-type refrigerator generally the temperature is high in
the compressor and low in the refrigerating chamber and it is generally
required that the refrigerant and the lubricating oil be circulated in the
system without causing phase separation in the wide range of
temperature. When the phase separation occurs during the operation of
the refrigerator, the life and the efficiency of the apparatus are adversely
affected to a great extent. For example, when the phase separation of the
refrigerant and the lubricating oil occurs in the part of the compressor,
the lubrication of the moving parts is deteriorated and the seizure occurs
to cause decrease in the life of the apparatus to a great extent. When the
phase separation occurs in the evaporator, the efficiency of heat
exchange is decreased because of the presence of the lubricating oil of
high viscosity.Because the lubricating oil for refrigerators is used for the purpose
of lubricating moving parts in refrigerators, the lubricating property is
naturally important. Particularly, because the temperature in the
compressor is high, the viscosity which can hold the oil film necessary 
for the lubrication is important. The required viscosity is different
depending on the kind of the compressor used and the working
conditions and it is generally preferable that the viscosity (kinematic
viscosity) of the lubricating oil before mixing with the refrigerant be 5 to
1000 cSt at 40°C.
