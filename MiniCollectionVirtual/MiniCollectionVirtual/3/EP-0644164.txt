<ABSTRACT>
Glass compositions suitable for the production of glass panes, capable especially of being employed in the architectural field or fitted to self-propelled and industrial vehicles. The glass composition according to the present invention includes, expressed in percentages by weight, from 0.75 to 1.4 % of total iron expressed in the form of Fe2O3, from 0.25 to 0.32 % of ferrous iron in the form of FeO and exhibits, under a thickness of between approximately 3 and 3.3 millimetres, an overall luminous transmission factor under illuminant A (TLA) of at least 70 %, an overall energy transmission factor (TE) lower than approximately 46 % and an ultraviolet radiation transmission factor lower than approximately 25 %.
