<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a printing blanket which has a non-uniform profile, and to a method for its application. Owing to the variation of the profile of the blanket cylinder (14, 16) and/or of the blanket (18, 20), either in relation to its material properties or in relation to its thickness, the blanket (18, 20) which is tensioned on a blanket cylinder (14, 16) corrects any undesirable changes in the speed profile of the web. If such changes in the speed profile are ignored, this can lead to creasing in the web, moving in a printing machine over the blanket cylinder, and thus have a considerably adverse effect on the register accuracy of the printing images. In a further design of the invention, a blanket cylinder is provided with a non-uniform profile (18').

<CLAIMS>
Rubber blanket for the offset printing process,
the rubber blanket (18, 20) having a multilayer

structure (A, B, C, D) with a layer B of an elastic,
deformable material and a layer (D) which is a printing

surface, being of a seamless, cylindrical design and
being such that its material property varies in the

axial direction in such a way that, during printing, a
uniform speed profile along a press nip can be

achieved.
Rubber blanket according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the rubber blanket is composed of a

mixture of materials.
Rubber blanket according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the material property is the

compressibility.
Rubber blanket according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the material property is the stiffness.
Rubber blanket according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the outer surface of the rubber blanket is

flat.
Rubber blanket according to Claim 1, characterized
in that the rubber blanket (18, 20) contains an

elastomer.
Printing unit for the offset printing process,
having the following features:


having a rotatable blanket cylinder (14, 16) with
an axle, 
having a rubber blanket (18, 20) which is mounted
on the blanket cylinder (14, 16) to transfer a

pattern of ink to a material web (12),
having a rotatable plate cylinder (22, 24) with a
plate which carries an image to be printed and

from which the pattern of ink is transferred to
the rubber blanket (18, 20), the printing plate

and the rubber blanket being in rolling contact at
the press nip (26, 28) formed between them, and
having a drive unit to rotate the plate cylinder
(22, 24) and the blanket cylinder (14, 16), and an

inking unit (34, 36) to feed ink to the plate
cylinder (22, 24), the rubber blanket having an

inner surface such that it engages with the outer
surface of the blanket cylinder (14, 16), and the

rubber blanket having a multilayer structure (A,
B, C, D) with a layer (B) of an elastic,

deformable material and a layer (D) which is a
printing surface, being of a seamless, cylindrical

design and being such that its material property
varies in the axial direction in such a way that a

uniform speed profile along the press nip (26, 28)
is achieved.
Printing unit according to Claim 7, characterized
in that the material property is the stiffness.
Printing unit according to Claim 7, characterized
