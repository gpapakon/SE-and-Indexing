<ABSTRACT>
A rotary machining device comprises a rotary 
tool and a device body which removably holds the rotary 

tool and drives to rotate the rotary tool. The rotary 
tool is formed by forming a large-diameter shank which 

is insensitive to vibration, through a small-diameter 
vibration damping section, at the rear end of an 

ultrasonic resonance body. The ultrasonic resonance 
body is formed by providing a magnetostrictive member on 

the outer peripheral surface of a rotary core having a 
machining edge on the forward end. The described rotary 

tool is removably held at the shank portion by the 
rotary driving section provided in the device body and 

is rotated; at this time a high-frequency magnetic force 
is applied to the magnetostrictive member from the 

ultrasonic driving section provided in the device body, 
thereby driving the rotary tool with ultrasonic 

vibration superposed on constant-speed rotation. 
Therefore, since the rotary tool itself produces the 

ultrasonic vibration, simplification of device 
construction, improvements in producibility of the 

device, and miniaturization and lightening of the device 
are realizable. Furthermore, because the rotary tool  

 
can be designed to be easily releasable, it is possible 

to improve the flexibility of machining operation by 
preparing varieties of rotary tools for different types 

of machining edges.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to tooth 
machining tools such as dental burrs and bits, cutting 
tools or grinding tools for precision machining and, 
more particularly, to ultrasonic vibration 
superimposing-type rotary machining devices for use in 
precision machining. Generally, in the field of machining, high-speed 
cutting operation using a cutting tool as a rotary 
tool having a cutting edge which is a machining edge, 
and high-speed grinding operation using a mounted 
grinding stone as a rotary tool having a machining edge 
are carried out. In the aforementioned cutting and grinding 
operations, generally the higher the cutting or grinding 
speed, the higher the cutting quality of the cutting 
edge becomes; therefore, high-speed rotary units using a 
tool mounted on a spindle of a milling machine or  
 
cutting center and those which are adapted to operate in 
interlock with an engine, a rotor, or an air turbine, 
which has a tool operating in interlock with a small, 
handy electric motor are used in large quantities. 
Particularly the handy units are very frequently used 
also in odontotherapy. In these small-size rotary machining devices, 
the tool is designed to be driven by an electric motor; 
however, the cutting or grinding speed is low because of 
a small tool diameter and a low maximum speed of 
rotation of the electric motor which drives the tool. 
In order to solve such a problem, there has been worked 
a rotary machining device for rotating the tool at a 
very high speed by means of the air turbine. Some of 
these rotary machining devices rotating at a speed of 
500,000 to 600,000 rpm have been realized. In the case 
of the rotary machining device of the described 
constitution, since the tool rotates at a high speed 
with a low cutting resistance, the device is utilized 
for tooth cutting as a dental equipment. It, however, 
is demanded to further reduce the cutting resistance to 
alleviate a patient's pain and discomfort. In the meantime, in the field of tooth cutting 
in the odontotherapy, there has been disclosed a rotary  
 
machining device in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho 
36-19650, in which rotating dental burr or bit is 
superposed with ultrasonic vibration of longitudinal or 
torsional mode for the purpose of reducing the cutting 
resistance by the vibratory cutting effect in relation 
to the tendency of increasing the speed of tool 
rotation. Noticing the effect disclosed in this 
gazette, there also has been suggested, in for example 
Japanese Patent Publication No.
