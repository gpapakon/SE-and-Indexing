<ABSTRACT>
A system for monitoring a variable output paper 
processing device is provided. The monitoring system includes a 

counter (18) which counts the number of papers processed and provides 
a count signal for each counted paper. A controller (24) receives the 

count signals and totals the counts. The controller transmits the 
total count to a central station through a modem (14) after either a 

predetermined time or a predetermined count. Internal diagnostic 
signals in the printing device are intercepted as they are 

transmitted to an internal display device of the printing device 
and transmitted to the central computer (38) through the modem (14).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system for monitoring one or
more paper processors, and in particular to a method and apparatus
for monitoring photocopiers and signaling to the appropriate party
information regarding the number of copies made during a
predetermined time interval; when a predetermined number of copies
have been made; when service is necessary; and calendar events such
as when rental agreements or service contracts have expired.According to the present system, photocopying machines
when rented are billed at a per copy rate. This requires that
someone at a central billing center must contact each copier user
to ascertain the number of copies made over a predetermined time
interval. A copier user at the copier site then travels from
machine to machine reading the number of copies made over a
predetermined period from a copy count meter on each machine.
These manually read numbers are then manually transmitted by
telephone or postcard to the billing center where the bill for each
machine is calculated in accordance with the number of pages
reported by the on site meter reader. Additionally, meter readings
are used to monitor service contracts and preventive maintenance
schedules.This prior art billing system has not been satisfactory.
The manual reading suffers from the disadvantage that often the
people who are responsible for reading the meters are too busy to
read the meters at the predetermined times. Furthermore, they may
improperly read the meter or read correct data and transmit error
filled data causing the issuance of incorrect bills requiring
further manual labor to recheck the meter as well as correct the
bills. This results in a loss of time and money for both the
customer and the billing center.Machine service is also requested manually by the copier
user, requiring notification to the service center as to when the
machine is down or when preventive maintenance is required. A user
must first become aware of the problem and then the user must 
manually notify the service area of the need for repair or
preventive maintenance. This system has also not been
satisfactory. Often, users are not aware that a machine is down
and/or will often not report a down machine until all of the
machines in an office or area are down creating a backlog in the
office. Furthermore, when reporting that the machine is down, the
reporting person, not having technical expertise, will not be able
to correctly diagnose the problem. This may result in the
repairman arriving with the improper materials and
