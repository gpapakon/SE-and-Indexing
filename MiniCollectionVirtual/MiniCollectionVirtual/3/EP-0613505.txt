<ABSTRACT>
Drawing, especially cold-drawing, or hot-drawing or other heat-treatments of spin-oriented crystalline polyester filaments, and particularly polyester feed yarns, that have been prepared by spinning at speeds of, e.g., 4 km/min, and have low shrinkage and no natural draw ratio in the conventional sense, provides useful techique for obtaining uniform drawn filaments of desired denier and thereby provides improved flexibility to obtain filaments and yarns of various denier. The resulting uniform filaments have useful properties that are improved in certain respects.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TITLEIMPROVEMENTS IN POLYESTER FILAMENTS, YARNS AND TOWSThis invention concerns improvements in and relating to polyester (continuous) filaments, especially in the form of flat yarns, and more especially to a capability to provide from the same feed stock such polyester continuous filament yarns of various differing deniers, as desired, and of other useful properties, including improved processes; and new polyester flat yarns, as well as filaments, generally, including tows, resulting from such processes, and downstream products from such filaments and yarns.Textile designers are very creative. This is necessary because of seasonal factors and because the public taste continually changes, so the industry continually demands new products. Many designers in this industry would like the ability to custom-make their own yarns, so their products would be more unique, and so as to provide more flexibility in designing textiles.Polyester (continuous) filament yarns have for many years had several desirable properties and have been available in large quantities at reasonable cost, but, hitherto, there has been an important limiting factor in the usefulness of most polyester flat yarns to textile designers, because only a limited range of yarns has been available from fiber producers, and the ability of any designer to custom-make his own particular polyester flat yarns has been severely limited in practice. The fiber producer has generally supplied only a rather limited range of polyester yarns because it would be more costly to make a more varied range, e.g. of deniers per filament (dpf) , and to stock an inventory of such different yarns.Also, conventional polyester filaments have 

 combinations of properties that, for certain end-uses, could desirably be improved, as will be indicated hereinafter. It is important to recognize that what is important for any particular end-use is the combination of all the properties of the specific yarn (or fiber) , sometimes in the yarn itself during processing, but also in the eventual fabric or garment of which it is a component. It is easy, for instance, to reduce shrinkage by a processing treatment, but this modification is generally accompanied by other changes, so it is the combination or balance of properties of any filament (or staple fiber) that is important.Generally, hereinafter, we refer to flat (i.e., untextured) filament yarns. It will be recognized that, where appropriate, the technology may apply also to polyester filaments in other forms, such as tows,
