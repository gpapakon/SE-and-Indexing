<ABSTRACT>
An automatic line equalizer (not shown) for use with a T1 or an E1
repeater in a telecommunications system includes a line condition/length detector

(200). The line condition/length detector includes a first electrical element (206), a
second electrical element (202), and an amplifier circuit (204). The first electrical

element (206) exhibits a fixed impedance. The second electrical element (202)
exhibits a variable impedance which varies as a function of a gain control voltage

(V
AGC
) of the line equalizer. The amplifier is configured to produce an output
voltage as a function of a ratio between the impedance of the first electrical element

and the impedance of the second electrical element. The output voltage of the
amplifier is indicative of the condition/length of the input line. The equalizer is

responsive to the line condition/length indication (210). The line condition/length
indication is used to switch or coarsely tune the equalizer to accommodate differing

line conditions/lengths.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to repeaters used in digital telephone communications, and 
more particularly, to an automatic line length equalizer for use in a T1 or an E1 
repeater. In telephony, T1 and El are digital transmission standards. T1 is a standard 
used in the United States. A similar standard used in Europe is identified as the E1 
standard. An important component of a digital transmission system is the repeater. 
Repeaters are placed at regular intervals along a transmission line in order to 
regenerate signals. A digital baseband line equalizer is invariably employed in the 
front end of repeaters such as those used in a T1 or E1 system. The equalizer filters 
and amplifies a signal which has been distorted during transmission over a length of 
cable. The signal is a ternary digital signal transmitted at a rate of 1.544 Mbits/sec 
(megabits per second) in the T1 standard, and 2.04 Mbits/sec in the E1 standard. By 
ternary, it is meant that the signal has three logic levels: low, zero and high. Data is 
encoded using an alternate mark inversion (AMI) scheme in which a logical zero is 
transmitted as a zero voltage, and a logical one is transmitted as either a high or low 
voltage. System considerations require that the line equalizer automatically adjust its 
characteristics for different line lengths. For a T1 repeater, for example, the line loss 
varies from 0 db to 35 db at half the bit rate (because complementary data signals are 
used, the effective data rate is half the transmitted bit rate). The conventional line 
equalizer employs a variable RC network which is used to change the gain and 
frequency response of the equalizer to adapt to varying line conditions. However, the 
conventional scheme allows adaptation only over a limited range. What is needed is an equalizer which can adapt to a wide range of varying line  
 
conditions. The invention is a wide range digital baseband line equalizer. A line 
condition/length detector is used to switch the equalizer between coarse equalization 
settings. The equalizer then automatically adjusts to the specific line conditions. The 
line condition/length detector and the equalizer are fabricated on a single integrated 
circuit chip. The line condition/length detector includes a first electrical element (e.g., 
a MOSFET), a second electrical element (e.g., a MOSFET), and an amplifier circuit. 
The first electrical element exhibits a fixed impedance (or conductance). The second 
electrical element exhibits a variable impedance (or conductance) which
