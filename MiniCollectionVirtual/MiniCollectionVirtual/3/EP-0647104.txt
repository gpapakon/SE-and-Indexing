<ABSTRACT>
Footwear ventilation means is provided including a pumping chamber (31), and preferably arranged in the heel region (50) of the footwear, whereby operative cyclic supporting loads applied to the footwear will compress the pumping chamber and cause the pumping chamber (31) to contract and pump air under the user's heel pressure and thereby ventilate the footwear. The air may be pumped from the footwear to induce air circulation in the footwear or it may pump air into the footwear for forced air draught ventilation. Induced air draught is preferred for cooling the footwear and forced air draught is preferred for heating the footwear. The outlet (35) from the pumping chamber (31) may be regulated to provide a shock absorbing action which may constitute the or a primary consideration of the pumping chamber configuration.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements to footwear.This invention has particular application to sporting
footwear such as sneakers and joggers and hereinafter generally
referred to as sneakers but of course it is not limited thereto
and can be used in boots, shoes and slippers and the like.
However for illustrative purposes only, particular reference
will be made hereinafter to its application to sneakers.In recent years the construction of sneakers has become
very complex with a view to making sneakers comfortable to wear
and able to minimise shock loadings placed on the body during
active use. In order to achieve the desired results many
sophisticated construction techniques and synthetic materials
have been utilised in their manufacture. However despite the
sophisticated nature of such footwear there remains room for
improvement both in relation to discomfort resulting from shock
loadings applied to the user's feet or in relation to
discomfort resulting from the user's feet being either
uncomfortably hot or cold or confined without effective
ventilation..Furthermore a common problem remains with sneakers and
other footwear, namely foot odour resulting from uncomfortably
hot conditions. This problem is particularly noticeable in
sneakers due to the interaction of foot perspiration with the
synthetic materials of the sneakers. This condition is
aggravated by the lack of air circulation about the foot and
may cause fungal growth and other adverse medical problems for
the users.Footwear is also used for activities on cold surfaces and
by persons with poor circulation to their extremities including
their feet. At present the most common remedy for such
conditions is to wear thick socks as insulation against ingress
of the cold. This is only partially effective and may cause
discomfort to the user.The documents GB.A. 2 165 439 and EP.A. 350 103 disclose
ventilated footwear according to the precharacterizing part of
claim 1.The present invention aims to alleviate at least one of the
abovementioned disadvantages and to provide improvements to 
footwear which will be effective in use.With the foregoing in view, this invention in one aspect
resides broadly in ventilation means for ventilating a
footwear, including pump means arranged in reactive
relationship with the footwear such that in use loading placed
upon the footwear will cause the pump means to ventilate the
footwear. The ventilation may be effected by pumping air to,
from or within the footwear. The pump assembly may be of
basic form and be

<CLAIMS>
Ventilated footwear [30] of the type having a resilient

sole assembly [32], a pumping chamber [31]
, biassing means
[48]
 biassing said pumping chamber [31] to an expanded

attitude and said pumping chamber being substantially
contained within the heel of the sole assembly [32]
 for
cyclic compression by a user's heel and when compressed

having a volume which approaches zero, AND CHARACTERISED IN
THAT:


said pumping chamber [31] tapers towards the lateral

extremities of the heel;
an air inlet passage [41] to said pumping chamber [31]

extends from air inlets [40] in the sole assembly [32]

adjacent the toe region and to the pumping chamber [31]
whereby air can be induced to the pumping chamber 1[31]
 only
from said toe region air inlets [40]
;
an air outlet passage [42] from said pumping chamber

[31] exhausts to the exterior of the footwear, and
respective oppositely arranged non-return valves [34/35]
in said air inlet passage [41]
 and said air outlet passage
[42]

pumping chamber [31]
 from said air inlets [40] to said air

outlet passage [42] upon cyclic compression of said pumping

chamber [31].

flow through said air inlet passage [41]
 and said air outlet
passage [42]
 may be reversed for heating said footwear [30].
