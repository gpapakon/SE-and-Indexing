<ABSTRACT>
A mechanism for assembling sliding glass doors, 
comprising an upper track (3), a lower parallel guide 

(5) between which are arranged fixed sheets (1) and 
moveable sheets (2). The track (3) has an inverted L-shaped 

cross section and its vertical member (6) is provided 
with means (16) for fastening stops, the lower part of 

said member ending in an inverted groove (14) with an 
upper rib (15) on which slides the wheel (30) of the 

suspension heads which comprise two plates (20 and 21) 
that can be opposed and fixed together, with the 

interposition of a pivot (27) to regulate the separation 
between said plates. The horizontal member (8) of the L-shape 

is provided at the end with a channel (18) for 
fixing a shape (19) to restrict the lifting of the 

sheet (2).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a mechanism for 
sliding glass doors, with or without integral 
partitions, which can be installed without the having to 
carry out subsequent mechanization or tempering of the 
glass sheets. Known mechanisms for the assembly of sliding glass 
doors require the processing of the sheet or panel of 
glass in order to fasten certain parts to it, in general 
made of stainless steel, which are later used to secure 
the suspension elements. This processing requires the formation of rebates 
or holes in the sheets or panels of glass in a state 
which requires that said sheet be later subjected to a 
tempering or hardening treatment. This whole process is relatively expensive and 
furthermore carries the risk of causing breakages in the 
areas between housings and holes due to the effect of 
blows, and even the breakage of the entire sheet in the 
case of tempered glass. Other mechanisms for the assembly of sliding doors are known from DE-A-3 837 813, 
EP-A-2 631 072, EP-A-0 385 045 and DE-A-2 836 812. The object of the present invention is a mechanism 
which allows the sliding door to be assembled without 
having to carry out any operation or processing on the 
glass, thereby eliminating the process of preparing the 
sheets of glass and avoiding the risk of the breakage 
thereof. In particular, the mechanism of the invention is of 
the type which comprises a an upper track, a lower guide  
 
parallel to the upper track, suspension heads which can 
be fixed to the upper edge of the door and which are 
provided with bearing elements that can be moved along 
the upper track, and means of limiting the movements of 
said door. The mechanism of the invention is characterized in 
that it includes a upper track comprised in such a way 
that the various components of which the assembly is 
formed can be easily assembled. The mechanism of the 
invention also includes a suspension head comprised in 
such a way that it can be fixed to the sheet or panel of 
glass without having to carry out mechanization or 
special treatment operations on said panel. According to the invention the upper track 
comprises an inverted L-shape, the vertical member of 
which ends, along its free edge, in an inverted groove 
which protrudes towards the internal surface of said 
member and which is provided on the external surface of 
its base with a longitudinal rib with a rounded profile, 
said rib defining the bearing surface for the wheels or 
pulleys of the suspension heads. The same vertical

A mechanism for assembling sliding glass doors (2), 
comprising an upper track (3), a lower guide (5) parallel to the 

upper track, suspension heads (35, 36) which can be fixed to the 
upper edge of the door (2) and which are provided with 

bearing elements (30) that can be moved along the upper 
track, and means (32) of limiting the movements of said door (2), 

characterized in that the upper track (3) comprises an 
inverted L-shape, the vertical member (6) of which is 

provided on its internal surface with means (16) of fastening 
stops (17) which restrict the travel of the door (2) and which 

ends, along its free edge, in an inverted U-shaped groove (14), the base of which 
protrudes from the internal surface of said vertical member (6) and is 

provided on its external surface with a longitudinal rib (15) 
with a rounded profile, whilst the horizontal member (8) of 

the L-shape is provided with a central external channel (9) 
with through holes (10) in the base, and a slit (18) along its 

free edge for fixing a shape (19), the function of which 
is to restrict the lifting of the door, and is further 

characterized in that the suspension heads comprise two 
approximately equal rectangular plates (20, 21) which can be 

opposed and fixed together in corresponding positions, 
said plates (20, 21) being provided on their opposing surfaces 

with longitudinal rebates (33), beginning at the lower edge, 
which, when the plates are fixed together, define a slot that can be coupled to the upper 

edge of the door (2), one of the plates (21) being fitted on its 
external surface, with one or more freely rotating 

wheels (30), the axis of rotation of said wheel or wheels being perpendicular to said plate (21), and 
a pivot (32) designed to engage against the travel retaining 

stops (17), said wheel or wheels (30) being supported by the 
longitudinal rib (15) on the base of the inverted U-shaped groove (14) in 

which the lower edge of the track (3) ends.
