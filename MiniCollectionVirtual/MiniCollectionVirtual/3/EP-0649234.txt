<ABSTRACT>
A method and an apparatus for transferring structured data 
of a constant bit rate traffic in an ATM network. The 

method uses the recurrence of alignment of the structured 
data field of length N in a 47 octet SA_PDU payload. At 

the transmitting end the CSI bit of the header of the 
first SAR_PDU is set to 1. It is then set to 0 for the 

next SAR_PDUs until the Nth SAR_PDU is reached. It is then 
again set to 1. This process is repeated until the last 

SAR_PDU has been emitted.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to telecommunications networks and 
more particularly to a method of transferring structured 
data of constant bit rate traffic in an ATM network. In a digital transmission network, data from a large number 
of users are serially transmitted from one network 
node to another network node, up to their respective final 
destination. Due to the evolution of networks towards more and more 
complex mixing of sub-networks with heterogeneous architectures, 
it is clear that there is a requirement to support 
distributed computing applications across high speed 
backbones that may be carrying LAN traffic, voice, video 
and traffic among channel-attached hosts and workstations. Fast packet switching is now commonly used to accommodate 
the bursty, multiprocess communication found in distributed 
computing environments. Recently the concept of cell switching has been introduced. 
Cell switching can be thought of as a high performance 
form of packet switching. In packet switching networks, 
the packet size is a fixed maximum, but individual 
packets may always be shorter than the maximum. In a cell  
 
based network cells have a fixed length. Cells are usually 
a lot shorter than packets, because the use of short fixed 
length cells simplifies the hardware needed in each node 
of the network. Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) is a protocol for user 
access to and the internal operation of a public high 
speed cell switching system. This protocol is suitable for 
all kinds of traffic: data, voice, image, video. In order to make an ATM network practical it is necessary 
to adapt the internal network characteristics to those of 
the various traffic types that will use the network. This 
is the purpose of the ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL). The 
function of the AAL is thus to provide generalized 
interworking across the ATM network. The AAL function 
operates an end-to-end protocol across the ATM network to 
provide support for end users of different classes of 
service corresponding to generic classes of network traffic. One of these classes (Class One) is intended for constant 
rate voice and video applications. It requires a constant 
bit rate at source and destination, a timing relationship 
between source and destination and permits to transfer 
structured information between source and destination. Methods that satisfy these requirements are disclosed in 
Revised Recommendation I.363 from CCITT, which is included 
herein by reference. This Recommendation describes the interactions between the

A method of transferring with constant bit rate, from a transmitter to 
a receiver, consecutive data structures of N bytes length within SAR_PDUs 

comprising a header with a Convergence Sublayer Indicator (CSI) and a 
fixed length payload in a network using an Asynchronous Transfer Mode 

(ATM) protocol, wherein the ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) maps the higher 
layers Protocol Data Units (PDU) into the information field of the ATM 

cell using the functions of the Segmentation And Reassembly (SAR) 
sublayer, 


said method

setting the Convergence Sublayer Indicator (CSI) to 1 for each N or 
multiple of N SAR_PDU payloads, 
setting the Convergence Sublayer Indicator (CSI) to 0 for each 
payload different of the N of multiple of N SAR_PDU payloads, 
said Convergence Sublayer Indicator (CSI) indicating the alignment of 
the data structure of N bytes with the first byte of the SAR_PDU 

payload, 
said method comprising the steps of, at the transmitting end: 

a) setting the Convergence Sublayer Indicator (CSI) equal to 1, in 
the first SAR_PDU, 
b) setting an internal count to the value N, 
c) when the internal count is not equal to 0, setting the Convergence 
Sublayer Indicator (CSI) equal to 0 in the next SAR_PDU, and 

decrementing the internal count by one, 
d) repeating step c) until the internal count is equal to 1, 
e) setting the Convergence Sublayer Indicator (CSI) equal to 1 in the 
Nth SAR_PDU and setting the internal count to the value N,  

 
f) repeating step c) to e) until the last SAR_PDU is transmitted,

Indicator (CSI) equal to 1, the internal count is at 1, 
j) resetting the internal count to N, 
k) repeating steps i) and j) until the last SAR_PDU is received.
