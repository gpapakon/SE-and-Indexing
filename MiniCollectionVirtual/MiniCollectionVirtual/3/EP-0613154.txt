and joints of extra-high voltage power cables, and in which a 

cross-linking agent, comprising an organic peroxide subjected to 
purification processing, and an antioxidant, are blended, 

wherein the cross-linked composition has a dielectric loss 
tangent (tanδ) of less than or equal to 0.07% at a temperature 

of 90°C and under an electric field stress of 20 kV/mm. This 
polyethylene composition exhibits little dielectric loss, even 

at high temperatures or high electric field stresses, and is 
optimally employed in insulations and joints for extra-high

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a polyethylene composition
for use in insulations and joints of extra-high voltage power
cables.
In particular, the present
invention relates to a process for preparing a cross-linking polyethylene composition
having an extremely small amount of dielectric loss which is
highly suitable for use in insulations and the like of extra-high
voltage power cables of 275 kV or more.Conventionally, cross-linking polyethylene compositions
were known in which an organic peroxide such as dicumyl peroxide
or the like was added to low density polyethylene as a cross-linking
agent, this was mixed and heated, and thus caused to
cross-link; as a result of the superior characteristics thereof,
such as the resistance to heat, and the electrically insulating
properties, and the like, such compositions were widely employed
as insulations for electric power cables.However, in cases in which power cables employing
conventional cross-linked polyethylene compositions as
insulations were used in the power transmission of extra-high
voltage alternating current of 275 kV or more, the highest 
temperature during normal service reached 90°C, and the electric
field stress exceeded 20 kV/mm, so that there was a problem in
that dielectric loss was large, and it was thus difficult to use
such power cables.It is an object of the present invention to prepare a
polyethylene composition for insulations and joints of extra-high
voltage power cables which have extremely little dielectric
loss even at high temperatures or under conditions of high
electric field stress.In accordance with the present invention, a polyethylene
composition (I) for use in insulations and joints for extra-high
voltage power cables is prepared, wherein a composition obtained
after the cross-linking of a polyethylene composition, into
which a cross-linking agent comprising an organic peroxide
subjected to purification processing and an antioxidant are
blended, which is employable in insulations and joints for
extra-high voltage power cables, has a dielectric loss tangent
(tanδ) of 0.07% or less at a temperature of 90°C and at an
electric field stress within a range of 20 kV/mm. In the polyethylene composition (I) obtained according to Claim 1, the
electroconductive impurities which are the cause of the increase
in the dielectric loss tangent (tanδ) at high temperatures and
under high electric field stress are removed, and
accordingly, it is possible to suppress the increase in size of
the dielectric loss tangent
