<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to uses of cavitation in
liquids, produced by means of acoustic fields. In
particular, but not exclusively, the invention relates to
the use of focused acoustic fields in the cleaning and
etching of surfaces. Further, the invention also relates
to the use of cavitation in the treatment of marine life,
and to apparatus for use in such methods.Offshore structures used in oil and gas production
are subject to varying degrees of marine fouling. This
marine growth impedes inspection of the structure as the
majority of inspection techniques require access to a
relatively clean surface. More particularly, inspection
methods, such as Eddy current and magnetic particle
inspection for location of surface breaking flaws, and
ultrasonics for detection of internal flaws and detection
of flooded members, require a good surface contact to
produce reliable test results. Accordingly, to allow
inspection the structure must be cleaned prior to the
inspection being carried out.Marine fouling is generally classified as being
either hard or soft. Hard marine fouling typically refers
to growth such as barnacles, whereas soft marine fouling
would be represented by seaweed and the like. Various
methods for removing this growth, or discouraging 
settlement, have been considered and among the more popular
methods used are manual scrapers and brushes, water jetting
and rotary brushes. However, while these methods provide
relatively efficient means for removal of soft fouling,
they are generally unsatisfactory for removing hard
fouling. Further, at present, most offshore inspection and
cleaning operations require some degree of diver
intervention and such work can be dangerous and is also
relatively expensive.Utilising ultrasonics for cleaning offshore structures
has been proposed in US-A-4,444,146 and GB-A-2 165 330. In
US-A-4,444,146 a plurality of ultrasonic transducer
elements provide beams of ultrasonic energy which are
focused as a narrow band extending along a zone of
cavitation. The energization of the transducers is at a
level just below the onset of cavitation at their faces,
but results in cavitation where their beams overlap. The
transducer elements are mounted in a housing which is
movable over a surface to be cleaned. In GB-A-2 165 330 an
array of individual transducers is mounted on a part-spherical
dish so as to be directed to a common centre or
focus. The dish is mounted on a remotely controlled
vehicle controlled to progress over an area of a surface to
be cleaned.EP-A-0 068 961 describes an

A cleaning or etching method comprising:

providing an array of transducer elements;
controlling the timing of the activation of the
respective transducer elements to provide constructive

interference at a point of focus adjacent the surface of an
object to be cleaned or etched which is immersed in a

liquid;
producing cavitation in the liquid at the point of
focus; and
varying the timing of the activation of the respective
transducer elements to move the point of focus relative to

the object to be cleaned.
The method of claim 1 wherein the location of the
focus is moved axially relative to the object.
The method of claim 1 or 2 wherein the location of the
point of focus is moved across the surface of the object to

be cleaned.
The method of claim 3 wherein the location of the
focus is moved in a predetermined path over the surface of

the object to produce a desired surface pattern or
configuration. 
Apparatus for providing cavitation in a liquid
comprising:


an array of transducer elements; and
control means for (i) controlling the timing of the
activation of the transducer elements to provide

constructive interference at a desired point of focus and

transducer elements to move the point of focus.
The apparatus of claim 5 wherein the transducer
elements are located in a planar arrangement of concentric

rings.
The apparatus of claim 6 wherein the acoustic outputs
of the transducer elements are axially focused by time-delay

activation of the rings.
The apparatus of claim 7 wherein the time-delay
between ring activations is variable, to allow axial

movement of the point of focus.
