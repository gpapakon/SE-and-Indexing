Use of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate in a permanent shaping 
composition in the form of an aqueous solution for 

protecting the mechanical properties of hair, essentially 
its elasticity measured by the wet 15% extension stage, 

from the degradation brought about by the successive 
action of a permanent shaping and the ravages of the 

weather, in particular light. 
Use according to Claim 1 of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate in an 
aqueous reduction composition for the permanent shaping 

of hair. 
Use according to Claim 1 of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate in an 
aqueous fixing composition for the permanent shaping of 

hair. 
Use according to Claim 1 of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate in an 
aqueous intrapermanent composition used between the two 

steps of reduction and fixing in the treatment for the 
permanent shaping of hair. 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 4 of 
4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]
phenyltrimethylammonium 
methyl sulfate in amounts between 0.05 and 15% by weight, 

relative to the total weight of the reduction or fixing 
composition or of the intrapermanent composition. 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 5 of 
4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]
phenyltrimethylammonium 
methyl sulfate in amounts between 1 and 10% by weight, 

relative to the total weight of the reduction or fixing 
composition or of the intrapermanent composition. 
Use according to Claim 2 of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate in an 
aqueous reducing composition for the permanent shaping of 

hair, characterized in that 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate and the 
reducing agent are used in an extemporaneous mixture 

which is prepared at the time of use.  
 
Use according to any one of Claims 1 to 7 of 
4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]
phenyltrimethylammonium 
methyl sulfate in an aqueous permanent shaping composition 

containing natural plant or synthetic proteins 
which may be quaternized, amino acids, polymers and 

inorganic or organic water-soluble salts of divalent 
metals. 
Process for protecting the mechanical properties 
of hair, and essentially its elasticity measured by the 

wet 15% extension stage, against the degradation brought 
about by the successive action of a permanent shaping and 

the ravages of the weather, in particular light, characterized 
in that it consists in applying to the hair an 

effective amount of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate dissolved in an 
aqueous permanent shaping composition. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that it consists in applying to the hair an effective 

amount of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate dissolved in an aqueous reducing 
composition for the permanent shaping of hair. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that it consists in applying to the hair an effective 

amount of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate dissolved in an aqueous fixing 
composition for the permanent shaping of hair. 
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in 
that it consists in applying to the hair an effective 

amount of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate dissolved in an aqueous intrapermanent 
composition used between the reduction and fixing 

steps in the permanent shaping of hair. 
Process according to any one of Claims 9 to 12, 
characterized in that it consists in applying to the hair 

0.05 to 15% by weight of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]phenyltrimethylammonium 

methyl sulfate dissolved in an 
aqueous reduction, fixing or intrapermanent composition. 
Process according to Claim 13, characterized in 
that it consists in applying to the hair 1 to 10% by  

 
weight of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]
phenyltrimethylammonium 
methyl sulfate dissolved in an aqueous reduction, 

fixing or intrapermanent composition. 
Process according to Claim 10, characterized in 
that an extemporaneous mixing of 4-[(2-oxo-3-bornylidene)methyl]
phenyltrimethylammonium 
methyl sulfate and 

of the reducing agent is carried out at the time of use. 
Process according to any one of Claims 9 to 15, 
characterized in that natural plant or synthetic proteins 

which may be quaternized, amino acids, polymers and 
inorganic or organic water-soluble salts of divalent 

metals are introduced into the aqueous permanent shaping 
composition.
