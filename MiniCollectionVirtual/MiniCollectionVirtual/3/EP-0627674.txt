<ABSTRACT>
In a single component development system for use in electrophotographic 
apparatus, toner particles are moved from a toner hopper or dispenser cartridge (86) to a 

developer housing (80) and onto a donor roller (74) A rotating holey tube toner agitator (88) 
is modified to incorporate structure or grooves (106) on the outer peripheral surface. Further, 

by placing a shrouded toner dispense auger (82) inside the holey tube, the development system 
architecture stays compact but the delivery of toner powder and the pre-load of toner on the 

donor roller are improved. With more efficient pre- load, agitator rotational speed and bias 
can be reduced, leading to less toner effluents emanating from the developer housing without 

adversely affecting the cycle-to-cycle reloading of the donor roller with toner.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus for forming electrophotographic images and, 
more particularly, to a development system for use in such apparatus. In general, an electrophotographic printing machine requires a photoconductive 
member that is charged to a substantially uniform potential so as to sensitize the surface 
thereof. The charged portion of the photoconductive member is thereafter exposed to a light 
Image of an original document to be reproduced. Exposure of the charged photoconductive 
member selectively dissipates the charge thereon in the irradiated areas. This records an 
electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive member corresponding to the informational 
areas contained within the original document being reproduced. Alternatively, in a printing 
application, the electrostatic latent image may be created electronically by exposure of the 
charged photoconductive layer by an electronically controlled laser beam. After recording the 
electrostatic latent image on the photoconductive member, the latent image is developed by 
bringing a developer material charged of opposite polarity into contact therewith. In such processes, 
the developer material may comprise a mixture of carrier particles and toner particles or 
toner particles alone. Toner particles are attracted to the electrostatic latent image to form a 
toner powder image which is subsequently transferred to a copy sheet and thereafter permanently 
affixed to the copy sheet by fusing. In the foregoing type of printing machine, a development system is employed to 
deposit developer material onto the electrostatic latent image recorded on the 
photoconductive surface. Generally, the developer material comprises toner particles adhering 
triboelectrically to coarser carrier granules. Typically, the toner particles are made from a 
thermoplastic material while the carrier granules are made from a ferromagnetic material. Alternatively, a single component magnetic material may be employed. A system 
utilizing a single component developer material is capable of operating at high speeds and 
thus readily lends itself to use in high speed electrophotographic printing machines. However, 
a large continuous supply of toner particles must be available to be capable of copying large 
numbers of original documents or producing multiple copies of the same original document. 
This is necessary to ensure that the machine is not shut down at relatively short intervals due to 
the lack of toner particles. Ideally, this is achieved by

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for use in an electrophotographic printing machine for moving single 
component toner particles from a toner storage container (86) to a developer housing chamber 

(80) to pre-load the toner particles onto a donor roller (74), the apparatus comprising: 

a stationary drop tube (84); 
moving means (82) rotatably mounted within said stationary drop tube for moving toner 
particles 

along the stationary drop tube ; and characterized by comprising 
a rotatably mountable elongated member (88), 
within which the stationary drop tube is disposed, said elongated member comprising a hollow 

rod having a plurality of apertures (96) therein whereby rotation of the elongated member 
agitates the toner particles, 

but imparts substantially no movement 
to the particles in a direction along the stationary drop tube. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 1, wherein the moving means (82) comprises a toner 
dispense auger. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2, wherein said auger is a flat wire spiral auger or a 
helical spring auger. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the elongated 
member further comprises a plurality of radially extending blades disposed on the exterior 

surface of said hollow rod and/or a plurality of grooves cut in the exterior surface of said hollow 
rod. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein the said plurality of 
apertures in the said hollow rod are spaced apart uniformly and arranged in a plurality of rows. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein a portion of said 
stationary drop tube comprises a 

plurality of apertures (85) spaced apart along an outer periphery of said stationary drop tube.  
 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said elongated 
member is rotatable at a speed of about 250 rpm to 500 rpm. 
Apparatus as claimed in any one of the preceding claims, wherein said moving means 
is operable to move toner particles at a speed of about (10 in/sec to 30 in/sec) 25.4 to 76.2 cm/sec. 
Apparatus as claimed in claim 2 or claim 3, wherein said auger is rotatable at a speed 
of 30 rpm to 100 rpm.
