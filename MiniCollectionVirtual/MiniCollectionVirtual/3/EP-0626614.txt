<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a silver halide photographic
material sensitive to light sources emitting light between 600nm and
700nm. The present invention further relates to a method for
obtaining images with said photographic material and to a method for
obtaining a lithographic printing plate with said photographic
material.With recent rapid progress of information transmitting systems,
silver halide photographic light sensitive materials have been
increasingly required to have high sensitivity. Such systems are,
for example, high speed phototypesetting systems according to which
information output from an electronic computer is immediately
displayed as letters or figures by a cathode ray tube and press
facsimile systems for rapid transmission of newspaper originals to a
remote place.Photographic phototypesetting materials include photographic
films and papers used in a process for preparing a lithographic
printing plate and silver salt diffusion transfer based lithographic
printing plates disclosed in e.g. US-P-4,501,811 and US-P-4,784,933.
With the latter materials a lithographic printing plate is
immediately obtained without the need of a contact exposure or
camera exposure.Todate on the market phototypesetters usually work with a He/Ne
laser (632nm), laser diode (680nm) or LED (670nm or 780nm).
Especially phototypesetters that operate with a He/Ne laser or LED
(670-680nm) are frequently employed.For a photographic material to be suitable for use in
phototypesetting applications it is required that the material is of
high speed to so-called high intensity-short time exposure (flash
exposure or scanning exposure), namely exposure for 10-4 second or
less and yields images of high contrast and high resolving power:
therefore the emulsion grains contain rhodium and usually iridium
dopants.However, red-light sensitive materials are generally not so high 
in sensitivity and inferior in shelf stability and various proposals
have been made in an attempt to solve these problems. For example, a
technique called supersensitization has been proposed according to
which spectral sensitivity is markedly enhanced by adding a
specifically selected organic compound in addition to the spectral
sensitizing dye. Reference may be made to, for example, triazine
derivatives disclosed in U.S-P-2,785,058 and 3,695,888, and mercapto
compounds having (a) electronegative group(s) disclosed in U.S-P-3,457,078.
However, many of these supersensitization techniques
provide unsatisfactory results such as insufficient
