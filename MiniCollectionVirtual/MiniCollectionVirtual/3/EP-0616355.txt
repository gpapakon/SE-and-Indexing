<ABSTRACT>
A display device comprising a cathode ray tube is provided with a 
holder 

which comprises a faceplate and which is arranged in front of the 
display window. The 

space between the faceplate and the display window is filled with a 
liquid or a gel having a refractive index which differs maximally 0.25 

from the refractive index of the display window and faceplate. An 
improved image display, in particular an improved contrast and a 

flatter image are obtained. 
In a further embodiment, the holder is fixed to the implosion protection 

band of the cathode ray tube.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a direct-vision display device according to the first part of claim 1 comprising a 
cathode ray tube having a display window. Such display devices are commercially available (see FR-A-801 211). A display device generally comprises, in an evacuated 
envelope, a means for generating at least one electron beam (hereinafter referred to as 
"electron gun") and a display window whose inner surface facing the electron gun is 
provided with a luminescent screen. An image can be displayed on the luminescent 
screen by deflecting the electron beam(s) by means of deflection means (for example a 
system of deflection plates or coils) across the luminescent screen. The display window 
also has an outer surface through which a viewer can see the image displayed on the 
luminescent screen. However, the viewer also sees imperfections on said outer surface. 
These imperfections may be in the form of scratches, indentations etc. and may be 
caused by the manner in which the cathode ray tube has been manufactured. The viewer 
also sees reflections at the outer surface. All of said effects adversely affect the quality 
of the image displayed. Measures to avoid said disturbing effects are generally costly 
and give rise to other problems. The provision of, for example, an anti-reflection filter 
leads to a reduced reflection, but is time-consuming, costly and does not always 
eliminate the adverse effect of scratches etc., besides, it often has the disadvantage that 
the filter itself can become corroded, damaged or partially detached. In case the filter 
does not work properly, it is very difficult to remove. It is an object of the invention to provide a display device, 
in which the above drawback is reduced in a 
simple manner. To this end, the display device in accordance with the invention has 
a holder which is provided with a transparent plate is arranged in 
front of the display window, a transparent liquid or gel having a refractive index which 
deviates less than 0.10 from the refractive indices of the display window and the plate  
 
being provided in the space between the display window and the plate. Imperfections on the display window as well as reflections at the display 
window are made invisible to a substantial degree by the liquid. Said liquid almost 
perfectly follows the surface of the display window (as well as the surface of the 
faceplate). By virtue of the small difference in refractive index between the display 
window and the liquid almost no reflections occur at the

<CLAIMS>
A direct-vision display device comprising a cathode ray tube (4) having a 
display window (3) where a holder having a transparent plate (1, 23, 32, 75) is 

arranged in front of the display window and a transparent liquid or gel is provided in 
the space between the display window and the plate (17, 24, 27, 76) characterized in 

that the refractive index of the transparent liquid or gel differs less than 0.1 from the 
refractive indices of the display window and the plate. 
A display device as claimed in Claim 1 characterized in that the holder 
comprises an inlet and an outlet (25, 25) for supplying liquid to the space and draining 

it from the space. 
A display device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the 
cathode ray tube comprises an implosion protection band (20) around the display 

window where the holder is secured to the implosion protection band. 
A display device as claimed in Claim 1 or 2 characterized in that the 
cathode ray tube comprises an implosion protection band around the display window 

and the implosion protection band viewed in a direction transversely to the display 

window is extended in the direction of the plate in such a manner that a part of the 
implosion protection band forms part of the holder. 
A display device as claimed in Claim 1,2,3 or 4 characterized in that the 
side walls of the holder are opaque. 
A display device as claimed in Claim 1,2,3,4 or 5 characterized in that 
the plate is flat. 
A display device as claimed in Claim 1,2,3,4,5 or 6 comprising a housing 
(72) for the cathode ray tube (71) characterized in that the holder is at least partially 

formed by the housing. 
A display device as claimed in Claim 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 7 characterized in 
that the display device is a monitor.
