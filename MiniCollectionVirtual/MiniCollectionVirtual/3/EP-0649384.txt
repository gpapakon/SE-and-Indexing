<ABSTRACT>
On a textile sling band (1) the areas of wear, especially the end loops, are provided with reinforcing pieces (9) to protect against abrasion. The reinforcing piece (9) is a textile welt that at least partially covers the surface of the sling band (1) across the width (10) of the band. The textile welt is a fabric strip with contiguous zones (14, 15, 18, 19) of differing wear resistance across the width (10) of the band or in the weft direction. The zones of greater wear resistance (14, 15) cover the edges and/or flat sides of the sling band (1) and the zones (18, 19) of lesser wear resistance are firmly attached to the sling band (1).

A textile sling band (1) with a reinforcement (9) of the 
edges (11, 12) and/or surfaces as protection against abrasion, in 

the form of a textile overlay at least partly covering the circumference 
of the sling band (1) transversely to the longitudinal 

direction (5) of the sling band in the loop region (6, 7) and/or 
in the work surface region (4),
 
   characterized in that
 
the textile overlay is a woven strip with zones (14 - 19) with a 

different wear resistance, lying side by side transversely to the 
longitudinal direction (5) of the sling band, 


whose zones (14, 15; 10, 17) with a higher wear resistance 
cover the edges (11, 12) and/or surfaces of the sling band 

(1) and 
whose zones (18, 19) with a lower wear resistance are firmly 
connected to the sling band (1). 
A sling band according to claim 1,
 
   characterized in that
 
the zones (18, 19), with a lower wear resistance carry the connecting 

seams (23) for securing the textile overlay on the sling 
band (1). 
A sling band according to claim 2,
 
   characterized in that
 
the connecting seams (23) extend substantially in the longitudinal 

direction (5) of the sling band. 
A sling band according to claim 1,
 
   characterized in that
 
the warp threads of the zones (14, 15; 16, 17) with a higher wear 

resistance consist at least partly of a textile substance different 
from the warp threads of the zones (18, 19) with a lower 

wear resistance.  
 
A sling band according to claim 4,
 
   characterized in that
 
the warp threads of the zones (14, 15; 16, 17) with a higher wear 

resistance are at least partly aramide yarns, or particularly 
wear-resistant polyester yarns, for example, PES-staple fibre 

yarns. 
A sling band according to one of claims 1 to 5,
 
   characterized in that
 
the zones (18, 19) with a lower wear resistance are formed as 

grooves in the woven fabric. 
A sling band according to one of the preceding claims,
 
   characterized in that
 
the textile overlay extends in the longitudinal direction (5) of 

the sling band. 
A filing band according to one of the preceding claims,
 
   characterized in that
 
the textile overlay is non-load bearing.
