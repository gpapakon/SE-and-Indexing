<DESCRIPTION>
The present application is generally concerned with fiber optic sensors and light absorbing dyes which in combination are employed for qualitative and quantitative analytical determinations; and is specifically directed to the preparation and use of a single fiber optic array as a sensor for the detection of multiple analytes of interest concurrently.The use of optical fibers and optical fiber strands in combination with light energy absorbing dyes for medical, biochemical, and chemical analytical determinations has undergone rapid development, particularly within the last decade. The use of optical fibers for such purposes and techniques is described by Milanovich etal, "Novel Optical Fiber Techniques for Medical Applications", Proceedings of the SPIE 28th Annual International Technical Symposium on Optics and Electro-Optics, Volume 494, 1980; Seitz, W.R., "Chemical Sensors Based on Immobilized Indicators and Fiber Optics" in C.R.C. Critical Reviews In Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 19, 1988, pp. 135-173; Wolfbeis, O.S., "Fiber Optical Fluorosensors in Analytical Chemistry" inMolecular Luminescence Spectroscopy. Methods and Application (S.G. Schulman, editor), Wiley & Sons, New York; Angel, S.M., Spectroscopy 2(4): 38 (1987); and Walt etal., "Chemical Sensors and Microinstrumentation", ACS Symposium Series, Volume 403, 1989, p. 252. The optical fiber strands typically are glass or plastic extended rods having a small cross-sectional diameter. When light energy is projected into one end of the fiber strand (conventionally termed the "proximal end"), the angels at which the various light energy rays strike the surface are greater than the critical angle; and such rays are "piped" through the strand's length by successive internal reflections and eventually emerge from the opposite end of the strand (conventionally termed the "distal end"). Typically bundles of these strands are used collectively as optical fibers in a variety of different applications.For making an optical fiber into a sensor, one or more light energy absorbing dyes are attached to the distal end of the optical fiber. The sensor can then be used for both in-vitro and/or in-vivo applications. As used herein, light energy is photoenergy and is defined as electromagnetic radiation of any wavelength. Accordingly, terms "light energy" and "photoenergy" include infrared, visible, and ultraviolet wavelengths conventionally employed in most optical instruments and apparatus; the term also includes the other spectral regions of x-ray and microwave
