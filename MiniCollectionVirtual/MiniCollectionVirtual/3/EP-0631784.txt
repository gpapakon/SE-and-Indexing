Sulphated polysaccharides having anti-inflammatory activity
</INVENTION-TITLE>
<ABSTRACT>
A method of anti-inflammatory treatment of an animal 
or human patient comprises administration to the patient of 

an effective amount of at least one sulphated 
polysaccharide which blocks or inhibits endoglycosidase, 

particularly heparanase, activity. Suitable sulphated 
polysaccharides include heparin and modified heparin, 

fucoidan, pentosan sulphate, dextran sulphate and 
carrageenan lambda.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to compounds having anti-inflammatory
activity, and in particular it relates to the
use of these compounds as anti-inflammatory agents in
animals and man.One of the key events in inflammation is the
adherence of leukocytes or tumour cells to blood vessel
walls and their subsequent emigration into tissues. The
molecular basis of these processes is poorly understood
although it is generally accepted that penetration of the
vessel wall requires localised degradation of the
interendothelial cell junctions and subendothelial matrix
by specific degradative enzymes.It has now been discovered that continuous infusion
of certain sulphated polysaccharides, such as heparin and
fucoidan, can completely prevent experimental allergic
encephalmyelitis (EAE), an animal inflammatory disease
similar to multiple sclerosis in humans. In a first aspect, the present invention relates to
the use in the manufacture of a medicament for the
anti-inflammatory treatment of an
animal or human patient
of at least one
sulphated polysaccharide which blocks or inhibits endoglycosidase
activity, said sulphated polysaccharide being fucoidan or periodate-oxidised,
reduced heparin.In another aspect, this invention relates to
a pharmaceutical or vetinary composition for anti-inflammatory
treatment
which comprises at least one
sulphated polysaccharide which blocks or inhibits endoglycosidase
activity, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable
carrier or diluent therefor, said sulphated polysaccharide being
fucoidan or periodate-oxidised, reduced heparin.This invention particularly relates to the use of
sulphated polysaccharides which block heparinase activity.
One 
particularly preferred
active component is heparin
that has been
appropriately modified to reduce anti-coagulant
activity,
namely periodate oxidized, reduced heparin that has
negligible anti-coagulant activity but is a potent anti-metastatic
agent. The endoglycosidase-inhibitory
activity of the polysaccharide is retained.The following Example demonstrates the anti-inflammatory
activity of the sulphated polysaccharides,
modified heparin and fucoidan. Rats. Lewis (RT-11) rats were bred at the John
Curtin School of Medical Research. Both males and females
of 8-10 weeks of age were used. In each experiment
controls and experimental rats were matched for sex. Active. Guinea pig BP was prepared according to the
method of Deibler et al ( 2 ) and BP in saline was emulsified
in an equal volume of incomplete Freund's adjuvant
containing 4 mg/ml added Mycobacterium
