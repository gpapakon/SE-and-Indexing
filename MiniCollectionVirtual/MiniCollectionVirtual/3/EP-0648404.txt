<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is in the area of portable
computer systems, and is particularly relevant to
portable computers known as notebook computers.Notebook computers such as disclosed in US-A-894 792 are popular among computer users
who travel and need to take their work along. They are
smaller and lighter than laptops, and are therefore more
portable. The evolution to smaller and lighter portable
computers, however, is not without problems. For one
thing, smaller portable computers means less space for
battery packs, which usually means shorter useful life
between recharges. Another problem related to smaller
size is a difficulty in providing versatility. Smaller
size naturally means less space to provide a broad choice
in peripheral devices and options.Yet another problem is related to addresses and
data byte size. State-of-the-art computers are capable
of 32 bit addresses and 32 bit data words. A 32 bit
computer, though, typically needs a bus structure with
nearly 100 active signals, equating to high pin count and
extensive device and component density. Such high
density in a small computer creates many other problems,
such as problems with heat dissipation. These are a few
of the many problems in designing and developing notebook
computers.What is needed is a new design for a notebook
computer based on a bus structure allowing 32-bit
capability with a minimum pin count, utilizing, for
example, multiplexing of address and data on a single 32
bit structure, and utilizing only state-of-the-art
technology to minimize power (hence buffer) requirements,
which also minimizes heat and equipment complexity and 
density problems. Modularity needs to be raised to a new
level by making virtually all components modular and
"plug-in", including CPUs, power packs, and all of the
various known sorts of peripheral devices.In accordance with the present invention
a modular computer having a framework comprises:
frame and enclosure means for supporting and housing elements of the
framework, said frame and enclosure means having a plurality of module baysfor docking functional modules ;notebus means for address, power, control, and data transmission
between module bays;electrical power conversion means for accepting electrical power from
outside said framework, converting said outside electrical power to voltage and
current levels needed by said module bays, and supplying said electrical power to said
at least one power trace in said notebus means ;display means connected to said notebus means for displaying text and
