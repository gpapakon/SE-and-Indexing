<ABSTRACT>
N-Piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyra zole-3-carboxamide of formula: 
<
IMAGE
>
 its salts and solvates are powerful antagonists of central cannabinoid receptors. They are prepared by reaction of a functional derivative of 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxyli c acid with 1-aminopiperidine and then optional salification.
