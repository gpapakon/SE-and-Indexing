<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a method of determining
the amounts of contaminant remaining on surfaces of
interest to an individual or an agency. More
particularly, the invention relates to a method of
determining when a container or any surface is
sufficiently free of contaminants.A problem associated with the use of pesticides
and other materials treated as, or perceived to be
hazardous, is the safe disposal of the container.A number of the pesticides registered with the
EPA instruct the user to dilute them with water prior
to application to the selected target. By state and
federal law, these containers must be triple-rinsed
with a volume of water equal to 10-30% of the
original volume, or pressure rinsed for at least 30
second before the container can be discarded. When
either of these two actions have occurred, the
container can be considered as non-hazardous waste.
However, since it is very difficult to prove that the
container has been rinsed and since extremely small
amounts of residual products may cause future
problems, most pesticide containers are not readily
accepted in landfills. This reluctance on the part
of landfills to take containers means that either
state or federal programs must be established to
collect, inspect and dispose of the containers. Even
under these conditions it is difficult for the state
or federal agents to insure that the containers are
acceptable. The only way to determine that rinsing
techniques have effectively cleaned the container and
rendered it suitable for disposable is to analyze the 
water remaining in the rinsed container. For a vast
majority of users such analyses are very expensive,
time-consuming and impractical. This same problem of
establishing that the container has been properly
rinsed holds true for the homeowner who elects to
safely dispose of pesticide, paint, bleach, pool
chemicals or household cleaner containers.Most programs for confirming the cleanliness of
the container rely on visual inspection coupled with
checking for the remnants of any solvent odors. With
proper training this can be used successfully with
odiferous products and those that are highly
colored. Unfortunately, there are many hazardous
products which are odorless and colorless.Another method relies on analytical procedures
for the detection of specific contaminants. This
procedure becomes very prohibitive when several
different chemicals are being used. Such analytical
techniques include but are not limited to
spectophotometric analysis, immunoassay techniques,
gas and liquid

A method of determining the amount of a
contaminant substance remaining on a surface after the

surface has been rinsed with water, said surface originally
contacting a composition comprising a known concentration of

said contaminant, comprising

tagging said composition prior to said contacting
and rinsing with a predetermined amount of a surface active

agent;
taking a sample of a known volume of said aqueous
rinsate; and
determining the amount of surface active agent in
said rinsate sample, the determined amount of surface active

agent relative to the predetermined concentration of said
contaminant providing a measure of the amount of contaminant

remaining on said surface.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the surface
active agent is a non-ionic surface active agent preferably

selected from alkaryl polyether alcohols.
A method according to claim 2 wherein the alkaryl
polyether alcohols is selected from the group having the

structure


wherein R is a straight or branched alkyl of 8 to 9 carbon
atoms and x is an integer of at least 1.
A method according to claim 3, wherein the amount
of surface active agent is about 5 to 25 % by weight of the

composition.
A method according to claim 1 wherein the
composition contains one or more surface active agents

dissimilar to the surface active agent with which the
composition is tagged. 
A method of determining the amount of a
contaminant substance remaining in a container after the

container has been emptied and its interior rinsed with
rinse water, said container originally containing a known

contaminated volume of a composition comprising a known
concentration of said contaminant, comprising


tagging said composition prior to said emptying
and rinsing with a predetermined amount of a surface

active agent ;
taking a sample of an aqueous rinsate from said
container after said emptying and rinsing, the volume of

said rinsate sample being known relative to said
contaminated volume ; and
determining the amount of surface active agent in
said rinsate sample, the determined amount of surface

active agent relative to the predetermined concentration
of said contaminant providing a measure of the amount of

contaminant remaining in said container.
A method according to claim 6, wherein each
rinse of the interior of the empty container is effected

with a volume of water equal to 10-30% of the original
volume.
A method according to claim 6, wherein the
interior of the empty container is pressure rinsed with

water at a pressure of at least 275,790 Pa (40 psi) for
at least 30 seconds.
An article of manufacture for use in an assay
kit comprising a test substrate preferably a test tube or

well, having immobilized thereon antibodies specific to a
surface active agent. 
An assay kit comprising the test tube or well
of claim 9 in combination with immunoassay colorimetric

detection means.
