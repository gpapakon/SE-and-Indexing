<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method of detecting and monitoring ionising 
radiation such as nuclear radiation. The method comprises providing a 

diamond radiation sensor element (10) having a nitrogen concentration 
not exceeding 20 ppm and which is optimised for phosphorescent 

response, and exposing it to ionising radiation. The resulting 
phosphorescent response of the sensor element is then monitored, 

typically over a period of at least 20 seconds. The invention extends to 
the sensor element itself, and to apparatus employing the sensor.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS invention relates to a method of a sensor element for, and an apparatus
for the detection and monitoring of ionizing radiation.
From EP-A2-195678 diamond with a nitrogen content of less than 20ppm
as a thermoluminescent material is known.According to the invention a method of detecting and monitoring
ionizing radiation comprises providing a diamond radiation sensor
element having a paramagnetically measured nitrogen concentration not exceeding
20ppm and which is optimised for phosphorescent response, exposing the
sensor element to ionizing radiation, and monitoring the phosphorescent
response of the sensor element due to the ionizing radiation.Preferably, the phosphorescent response of the sensor element is
monitored for a period of at least one second.The phosphorescent response may be monitored for a period of at least 20
seconds and preferably at least 60 seconds.Light emitted by the sensor element may be amplified, with an electrical
signal related thereto being generated which is representative of the
intensity of the incident radiation.The electrical signal may be integrated over a predetermined period of
time.Alternatively, the electrical signal may be displayed as a function of
time.Further according to the invention a sensor element for monitoring 
ionizing radiation comprises a diamond body which has a paramagnetically
measured nitrogen concentration not exceeding 20 ppm and which is optimised for
phosphorescent response.The paramagnetically measured nitrogen concentration of the diamond body is
preferably 10 ppm or less.The diamond body may contain boron as an impurity.The boron concentration is preferably 20 ppm or less.The diamond body preferably has a concentration of a Group VIII
element of between 10 and 100 ppm.The Group VIII element may comprise one or more of iron, cobalt and
nickel.In one embodiment of the method, the sensor element is formed by a
high pressure, high temperature process in the presence of a catalyst
comprising one or more of iron, cobalt and nickel.In another embodiment, the sensor element is formed by a chemical
vapour deposition process, during which boron is introduced in a gaseous
form.Still further according to the invention, apparatus for monitoring ionizing
radiation comprises a diamond sensor element as defined above; light
sensor means for detecting the phosphorescent response of the radiation
sensor element; and monitoring means for translating the monitored
response into an output representative of the intensity of radiation
incident on the radiation
