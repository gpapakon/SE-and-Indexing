<ABSTRACT>
An image processing apparatus and method capable of 
displaying image data in each layer and confirming the 

image at each layer when the image data is encoded at a 
plurality of layers or when the encoded image data is 

decoded is provided. When an image is encoded, the 
inputted image data is stored in a frame memory, and 

reduced to 1/2 size, and then, stored in another frame 
memory. Encoding is performed based on the image data 

before and after the reduction. Whenever the reduction 
is performed, the reduced image is displayed on the 

display. When decoded, the encoded data is decoded at 
each layer, and the decoded image data is stored in the 

frame memory. The image data at each layer can be 
displayed on the display. If an entire image is 

displayed at the resolution of the display, the image is 
enlarged at an appropriate magnifying power. If not, a 

part of the image is displayed. Accordingly, an 
operator can encode/decode while confirming the image. 

On the display the encoded images are shown as ions in a window list. 
The operator can select one of the images from the window list which is 

then decoded and displayed in a layer display window. A designated area 
of the image in the layer display window can be displayed in a high 

resolution window. 
Encoding/decoded is performed according to e.g. the JBIG standard.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an image
processing apparatus and method of encoding progressive
build-up image data, and decoding the encoded image
data.The concept of progressive build-up coding
technique relating to the present invention is first
described. The technique is described in Technical
Survey "Progressive Build-up Coding Scheme for Bi-level
Images --- JBIG (Joint Bi-level Image Group) Algorithm"
in The Journal of the Institute of Image Electronics
Engineer of Japan Vol. 20, No. 1. The object of the
progressive build-up coding is to grasp an entire image
in a short time, and the conceptual diagram is shown in
Fig. 40. The resolution of an input image is assumed to
be 400 dpi to simplify the description. First, on the
encoder side, the processing of reducing the image (a
rectangular square 241 in Fig. 40) to 1/2 in width and
length is repeated n times, and n reduction images where
the smallest size of the image is 2-n of the input image
are generated. The input image is referred to as a
"zero layer" image, and the image at the lowest
resolution is referred to as an "n-th layer" image. In
the Figure, since the reduction processing is repeated 
five times, the input image is reduced to 2-5, and the
fifth layer image (an rectangular square 242 in Fig. 40)
is obtained. As a reduction processing, a method
capable of suppressing deterioration of information is
adapted so that the information of an entire image at
the low resolution such as 12.5 dpi or 25 dpi can be
grasped (Note that the PRES method is adapted in the
JBIG algorithm).The n-th layer image at the lowest resolution is
independently encoded, and an image at other layer is
encoded with reference to the image whose resolution is
one layer lower than the image to be encoded. That is,
the i-th layer image (i = 0, 1, ..., n-1) is encoded with
reference to the (i+1)-th layer image. In the JBIG
algorithm, encoding is performed by arithmetic coding.
In the JBIG algorithm, the encoding unit is a stripe
obtained by dividing an image in a sub-scanning
direction. At the leading portion of the data in the
JBIG algorithm, the header data containing such
information as the image size of the zero layer image,
stripe width, number of layers is provided, and the
obtained encoded data follows.When decoded, the encoded data of the n-th layer
image, the highest layer, is decoded first. The display
is started with the image at the lowest resolution. The
display is performed so that the resolution increases as 
information is supplied by enlarging the j-th
