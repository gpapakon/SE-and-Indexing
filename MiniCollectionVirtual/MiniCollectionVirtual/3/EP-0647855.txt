<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to electronic circuit board testing and, more particularly,
this invention relates to a pay-per-use system and method for controlling
access to a circuit board tester.Generally, a given circuit board consists of numerous interconnected
semiconductor chips, such as a microprocessor, memory chips, counter chips,
control chips, analog components, etc. After circuit boards have been
assembled, but before they can be used or placed into assembled products,
they must be tested to verify that all required electrical connections have been
properly completed and that all necessary electrical components have been
attached to the board in proper position and with proper orientation. Other
reasons for testing are to determine and verify whether the proper components
have been used. It is also necessary to determine whether each component
performs properly (i.e., in accordance with the specification). Some electrical
components also may require adjustment after installation.Automated circuit board testing is performed with the aid of a circuit board
testing machine. Circuit board testing machines are well known in the art.
For example, a well known circuit board testing machine is the Hewlett-Packard
Company Model HP-3075 Circuit Board Tester. The HP-3075, for
instance, has pins (the number of pins depends on board configuration) which
can simultaneously, selectively connect to various pins of a given circuit board
for measuring components of the board. The HP-3075 is fully described in
the HP 3070 Family Operating and Service Manuals available from Hewlett-Packard
Company. There are a variety of other circuit board testers which are commercially
available. The type of circuit board tester utilized depends on the type of test
that must be performed upon the circuit board. For example, an HP-3072U
circuit board tester is used to perform a simple analog test on an analog circuit
board or SMT open testing using HP TestJet software. A test that entails
standard in-circuit analog testing, simple digital in-circuit testing, or analog
functional testing, requires an HP 3072P circuit board tester. If more complex
digital in-circuit testing is required, an HP 3073 circuit board tester with
additional HybridPlus-6 cards and additional in-circuit software is required.
Finally, if standard in-circuit digital and analog testing, analog functional
testing, digital backtracing, fault dictionary testing, and timing set testing is
required, an HP 3075 circuit board tester with HybridPlus-6 cards and
combinationa

<CLAIMS>
A system for charging a user on a pay-per-use basis for access to the
multiple capabilities of a hardware platform, comprising:


(a) authorization means (300) for storing a pool of usage credits (240);
(b) a pay-per-use module (150), coupled to said hardware platform, for
monitoring use of said multiple capabilities of said hardware platform, and for

debiting a number of usage credits from said usage credit pool (240) based on
said use of said multiple capabilities.
A system according to claim 1, wherein said hardware platform is a circuit
board test platform (160,170) having multiple electronic test capabilities; and

said pay-per-use module (150) is coupled to said circuit board test platform
(160,170), for monitoring use of said multiple electronic test capabilities of said

circuit board test platform (160,170), and for debiting a number of usage credits
from said usage credit pool (240) based on said use of said multiple electronic

test capabilities.
The system of claim 2, wherein said pay-per-use module (150) does not
allow testing on said circuit board test platform (160,170), other than at a base

level, if there are insufficient credits in said usage credit pool (240).
