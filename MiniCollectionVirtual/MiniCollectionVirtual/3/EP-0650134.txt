<ABSTRACT>
A bar code reader for an object (17) moving at least essentially in one direction (26) has a scanner (12) which generates a scanning light beam (11) moving line by line over a surface (18) of the object (17), has a light receiving arrangement (13) which comprises an evaluation electronics unit (14) with which the bar code (16), which is applied on the surface of the object (17) and is scanned by the light beam (11), can be detected and which scanner is arranged outside the movement path (20) of the object (17) and is directed towards the front surface (18), seen in the movement direction, of the object (17). A detection means (27, 28) for the location of the scanning surface (18), on which the scanning is intended to begin, and if necessary a detection means (29) for the movement speed of the object (17) are connected to an evaluation and control electronics unit (14), which acts on an advancing means (30, 31) for the displacement of the scanning line (23) in such a way that the distance of the scanner (12) from the scanning line (23) on the surface (18) of the object (17) stays at least essentially the same.

Method of operating a bar code reader for codes (16) applied to an
article (17) which moves at least substantially in one direction (26)

using a scanner (12) which generates a scanning light beam (11)
which travels linewise along a scanned surface (18, 19) of the article

(17), which has a light receiving arrangement (13) including an
electronic evaluation and control circuit (14) with which bar codes

(16) on the scanned surface (18, 19) of the article (17) and scanned
by the scanning light beam (11) can be recognised, and which is

arranged outside of the path of movement (20) of the article (17)
and directed onto the front or rear scanned surface (18, 19) of the

article (17) as seen in the direction of movement, characterised in
that, with an article (17) moving towards the scanner (12), the

scanning light beam (11) is directed before the start of the scanning,
onto the region (21) of the scanned surface (18) lying closest

to the scanner (12) and/or, with an article (17) moving away from
the scanner (12), to the region (22) of the scanned surface (19)

which is furthest removed from the scanner (12); and in that the
advance (25) of the scanning line (22) substantially perpendicular

to the scanning direction which brings about the linewise scanning
is synchronised with the speed of movement of the article (17) in

such a way that the spacing of the scanner (12) from the scanning
line (23) on the scanned surface (18, 19) of the article (17) remains

at least substantially constant. 
Method in accordance with claim 1, characterised in that the
scanning line (23) extends horizontally or vertically and its advance

(25) correspondingly extends vertically or horizontally respectively.
Method in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in
that two scanners (12) are used, the scanning lines (23) of which

stand at least substantially perpendicular to one another.
Method in accordance with claim 1 or claim 2, characterised in
that three or more scanners (12) are used, the scanning lines (23)

of which extend at least substantially at an angle of 60Â° or at
smaller angles.
Bar code reader for codes (16) applied to an article (17) moving at
least substantially in one direction (26), the reader comprising a

scanner (12) which generates a scanning light beam (11) for
linewise scanning of a scanned surface (18, 19) of the article (17),

and which has a light receiving arrangement (13) including an
electronic evaluation and control circuit (14) with which bar codes

(16) scanned by the light beam (11) and applied to the scanned
surface (18, 19) of the article (17) can be recognised, the scanner

(12) being arranged outside of the path of movement (20) of the
article (17) and the light beam being directed onto the front or

rear scanned surface (18, 19) of the article (17) as seen in the direction
of movement, in particular for carrying out the method of

one of the claims 1 to 3, characterised in that a receiving means
(27, 28) for the location of the scanned surface (18, 19) at which 

the scanning should start and an input or detection means (29)
for the speed of movement of the article (17) are provided and are

connected to the electronic evaluation and control circuit (14);
and in that the electronic evaluation and control circuit (14) act

on an advance means (30, 31) for the displacement of the scanning
line (23) in such a way that the spacing of the scanner (12)

from the scanning line (23) on the scanned surface (18, 19) of the
article (17) remains at least substantially constant.
Apparatus in accordance with claim 5, characterised in that the
scanner (12) includes a light deflecting means (32), in particular a

mirror wheel (32), which is illuminated by a light beam (33) and
generates the scanning movement, and a light beam pivoting

means, in particular an oscillating mirror (31), which picks up the
light beam reflected by the light deflecting means (32) and generates

the advance (25), with the light beam pivoting means directing
the light onto the scanned surface (18, 19) and forming the

scanning line (23) at the location determined by the electronic
evaluation and control circuit (14).
