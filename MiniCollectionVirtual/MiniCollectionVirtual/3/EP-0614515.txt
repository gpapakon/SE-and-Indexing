<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a die-cutting press 
and more particularly to such a press which includes a 
drive unit for converting unidirectional rotary motion 
into reciprocating rotary motion. From GB-A-2 224 967 a die-cutting press according 
to the preamble of claim 1 is known, in which the drive means 
comprises a two-directional motor which is started and stopped 
for each movement of the movable bed, the rotational 
direction of the motor being reversed after each of the movements. According to the invention 
there is provided a die-cutting press comprising: 
a movable bed for supporting a die for cutting 
and/or creasing a sheet; a pressing roller for applying pressure to the 
combination of the die and the sheet supported on the 
bed to form the required cuts and/or creases in the 
sheet; and drive means for moving the movable bed back and 
forth relative to the pressing roller and for 
reciprocatingly rotating the pressing roller in 
synchronisation with the motion of the movable bed, 
characterised in that the drive means comprises; a drive unit for converting undirectional 
rotary motion into reciprocating rotary motion, the 
drive unit comprising a slider, guide means supporting 
the slider for rectilinear reciprocating motion, 
rotatable crank means for reciprocating the slider 
relative to the guide means in response to undirectional 
rotation of the crank means, and a threaded rotatable 
member mounted for rotation relative to the guide means 
and co-operable with a complementarily threaded part 
movable with the slider so that as the slider is 
reciprocated to and fro relative to the guide means by 
the crank means, the threaded rotatable member will 
undergo reciprocating rotary motion;  
 wherein one of the threaded member and 
threaded part is the shaft of a ball screw and the other 
is the nut of a ball screw, and  wherein the reciprocating rotary motion of the 
threaded rotatable member causes reciprocating rotation 
of the pressing roller and reciprocating motion of the 
bed relative to the pressing roller so that the 
combination of the die and the sheet is roll pressed 
between the pressing roller and the bed.   Preferably, the threaded part is a ball screw 
nut and the threaded rotatable member is a ball screw 
shaft. In a preferred embodiment, there are two 
threaded rotatable members mounted for rotation about 
parallel spaced apart axes, two threaded parts movable 
with the slider and co-operable respectively with the 
two threaded rotatable members, and an output shaft 
mounte

<CLAIMS>
A die-cutting press comprising: 

a movable bed (7) for supporting a die for cutting 
and/or creasing a sheet; 
a pressing roller (5) for applying pressure to the 
combination of the die and the sheet supported on the 

bed (7) to form the required cuts and/or creases in the 
sheet; and 
drive means for moving the movable bed (7) back 
and forth relative to the pressing roller (5) and for 

reciprocatingly rotating the pressing roller (5) in 
synchronisation with the motion of the movable bed (7), 

characterised in that the drive means comprises 
a drive unit for converting unidirectional 
rotary motion into reciprocating rotary motion, the 

drive unit comprising a slider (33), guide means (21,22) supporting 
the slider (33) for rectilinear reciprocating motion, 

rotatable crank means (37,38) for reciprocating the slider (33) 
relative to the guide means (21,22) in response to 

unidirectional rotation of the crank means (37,38), and a 
threaded rotatable member (23,24,35,36) mounted for rotation relative 

to the guide means (21,22) and co-operable with a 
complementarily threaded part (23,24,35,36) movable with the slider (33) so 

that as the slider (33) is reciprocated to and fro relative 
to the guide means (21,22) by the crank means (37,38), the threaded 

rotatable member (23,24,35,36) will undergo reciprocating rotary 
motion; 
wherein one of the threaded member and 
threaded part is the shaft (23,24) of a ball screw and the other 

is the nut (35,36) of a ball screw, and 
wherein the reciprocating rotary motion of 
the threaded rotatable member (23,24,35,36) causes reciprocating  

 
rotation of the pressing roller (5) and reciprocating motion 

of the bed (7) relative to the pressing roller (5) so that the 
combination of the die and the sheet is roll pressed 

between the pressing roller (5) and the bed (7). 
A die-cutting press as claimed in claim 1, 
wherein the threaded part is a ball screw nut (35,36) and the 

threaded rotatable member is a ball screw shaft (23,24). 
A die-cutting press as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, comprising two threaded rotatable 

members (23,24,35,36) mounted for rotation about parallel spaced apart 
axes, two threaded parts (23,24,35,36) movable with the slider (33) and co-operable 

respectively with the two threaded rotatable 
members (23,24,35,36), and an output shaft (29) mounted for rotation 

relative to the guide means (21,22) and connected to the two 
threaded rotatable members (23,24,35,36) by gears, the pressing roller (5) 

and bed (7) being driven by the output shaft. 
A die-cutting press as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the guide means includes 

two spaced parallel guide rods (21,22) and the slider (23) comprises 
a first part (33A) slidably mounted on the guide rods (21,22) and a 

second part (33B) connected to the first part (33A) and supporting 
the or each threaded part (23,24,35,36). 
A die-cutting press as claimed in claim 4,  
 

wherein means (34',48,49,52) are provided to adjust the spacing between 
the first (33A) and second (33B) parts of the slider in order to 

adjust the end of travel positions of the second part (33B). 
A die-cutting press as claimed in any one of 
the preceding claims, wherein the crank means (37,38) is 

arranged so that the velocity of the slider (33) follows or
