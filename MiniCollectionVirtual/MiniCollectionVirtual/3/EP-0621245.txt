<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a multilayer glass ceramic 
substrate suitable for arranging LSI elements in high density, 
and more particularly to a multilayer glass ceramic 
substrate which can be fired at relatively low temperature 
and a method for fabricating the same. With the development of semiconductor technology, an 
electronic device is more required to be smaller in size and 
operate at higher speed. In the field of a semiconductor 
element, since VLSI and ULSI are highly densified and integrated, 
the technology for assembling these semiconductor 
elements is required to handle extremely densified and refined 
components. In particular, a substrate on which semiconductor 
elements are to be mounted is required to have low 
dielectric constant and be able to have highly densified 
leading wire arrangement thereon in response to the requirement 
of reducing leading wire diameter due to increased 
density of leading wire arrangement, and also in response to 
the requirement of reducing resistance of leading wires and 
the requirement of high operation speed. An multilayer substrate made of aluminum oxide (aluminum 
oxide is generally referred to as "alumina") has conventionally 
been used. This multilayer substrate can be fabricated 
by thick film printing multilayer process or green 
sheet lamination process. The green sheet lamination process 
is detailed, for instance, in United States Patents Nos. 
3,423,517 and 3,723,176. The green sheet lamination process 
is more preferable for accomplishing highly densified arrangement.  
 
In the green sheet lamination process, leading 
wires are printed on each thin ceramic green sheet layer, and 
then layers are integrally laminated. Accordingly, it is 
possible to increase a number of layers on which leading 
wires have been printed, enabling highly densified arrangement 
of leading wires relative to thick film printing multilayer 
process. However, since alumina ceramic has the firing 
temperature above 1500 degrees centigrade, it is necessary 
for leading wires to use metals having relatively high electrical 
resistance such as Mo and W. This increases difficulty 
in reducing diameter of leading wires. Recently ceramic material which can be fired at relatively 
low temperature has been developed in order to make it 
possible to use low-resistive conductors such as Au, Ag-Pd, 
Ag and Cu. A compound composed of alumina and borosilicate 
lead glass can be fired at the temperature below 1000 degrees 
centigrade, and hence a multilayer substrate in which
