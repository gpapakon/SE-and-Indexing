<ABSTRACT>
The rotor 2 of a rotating field type turbine 
generator is provided with slots 3 for accommodating the 

field windings, wedges 4 positioned at the portions of 
the magnetic poles on the rotor 2 for holding the field 

windings and wedges 5 positioned between the magnetic 
poles on the rotor. These wedges 4 and 5 are constituted 

by metal bars without joints to enhance damper effect 
thereby. Magnetomotive forces due to higher harmonics, 

which causes temperature rise of the rotor 2 and torque 
ripple during starting with thyristors, induces an 

elliptic rotating magnetic field having the longer 
diameter on d axis extending in the direction of 

magnetomotive force induced by the field windings and the 
shorter diameter on q axis perpendicular to d axis, and 

thus a larger eddy current is induced flowing along q 
axis on the rotor 2 than that flowing along d axis. 

Therefore the thickness d' in radial direction of the 
wedges 5 positioned between the magnetic poles on the 

rotor 2 is determined larger than the thickness d in 
radial direction of the wedges 4 positioned at the 

portions of the magnetic poles on the rotor 2 to reduce 
the resistance of the wedges 5 and to easily lead the 

eddy current flowing in the axial direction of the 
rotor 2, thereby a good thermal balance over the entire  

 
portions on the rotor 2 is achieved.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a turbine 
generator and, in particular, relates to a turbine 
generator which is suitable for starting a gas turbine, 
acting as a variable speed synchronous motor by 
connecting armature windings of the turbine generator 
with a thyristor type starting device. These days, combined cycle electric power 
generation has drawn attention in view of its energy 
efficiency. Fig. 2 shows a constitution diagram of a 
combined cycle electric power generation system. It 
consists of a gas turbine 10, a steam turbine 11 which 
uses heat in the exhaust from the gas turbine 10 as heat 
source for a turbine generator 12 and a boiler (not 
shown). A gas turbine 10, steam turbine 11 and turbine 
generator 12 are arranged along a common axis as a single 
element, and to provide greater capacity, a single plant 
is generally composed of an array of such elements. Such 
a combined cycle electric power generation plant is 
usually located near urban area heaving a large electric 
power demand and is operated on DSS (Daily Start and 
Stop) basis, in that gas turbines 10 are successively 
started dependent upon the load demanded of the plant. The general trend toward increasing the gas 
turbine combustion temperature to achieve higher 
efficiency results in the capacity of the gas turbine in 
the combined cycle electric power generation plant  
 
increasing, and accordingly the capacity of the starting 
device for the gas turbine must be increased. In a conventional starting device for starting 
the gas turbine, a torque converter system is used in 
which a torque converter and an induction motor is 
directly coupled at a power train axial end. However, 
because of limits on the manufacturable size of the 
torque converter, increases in the capacity the starting 
device eventually become difficult. Attention is 
therefore directed to alternative, thyristor type, 
starting system. The thyristor type starting system is 
one in which the turbine generator 12 is started as a 
variable speed synchronous motor by making use of a 
thyristor type starting device 13. Through provision of 
a change-over device 1 between the turbine generators 12 
and the thyristor starting device 13, a single thyristor 
starting device 13 can be used for all elements of the 
array. Therefore, a more compact building can 
accommodate all of the necessary devices. In a conventional generator, the rotor is 
provided with field windings which excite the generator 
while receiving a DC current from a suitable current 
sourc
