<ABSTRACT>
The fastening element (1) for securing insulating panels (10) comprises a sleeve-shaped retaining part (2) at whose one end there is integrally formed a radially projecting head plate (3). By means of a nail (6) which can be driven in through the inner bore (4) of the retaining part (2), the retaining part (2), and thus the insulating panel (10), can be braced against the structural part (11). For bracing purposes, use is made of a clamping sleeve (7) which is inserted in the inner bore (4) of the retaining part and engages around the nail shank (6) in a clamping manner.

<CLAIMS>
A fastening element (1) for fastening insulating panels (10) 
to components (11), comprising a sleeve-shaped holding portion (2, 2a, 

2b, 2c) which has a head plate (3) and which has an internal bore (4), 
and a fastener (6) which can be driven into the component (11) through 

the internal bore (4) in the holding portion (2, 2a, 2b, 2c) and which 
braces the holding portion (2, 2a, 2b, 2c), wherein fitted in the 

internal bore (4) of the holding portion (2, 2a, 2b, 2c) is a clamping 
sleeve (7, 14) which clampingly embraces the shank of the fastener (6), 

characterised in that the fastener is a nail (6) which has a nail head 
(5) and a nail point and which can be driven into the component (11) 

without preliminary drilling, that during fitting of the fastening 
element when the nail (6) is driven into the component (11) the 

clamping sleeve (7, 14) is axially displaceable from a first position 
remote from the nail head (5) into a second position of being closer to 

the nail head (5) in opposite relationship to the direction in which 
the nail (6) is driven into the component (11), whereby the distance 

between the head plate (3) and the nail point increases in a manner 
corresponding to the displacement of the clamping sleeve (7, 14). 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the clamping sleeve (7, 14) is in the form of a spring sleeve, 

with a longitudinal slot (9). 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the internal bore (4) of the holding portion (2) has an enlarged 

first portion (4a) extending from the head plate (3) and adjoining same 
a second portion (4b) whose diameter reduces approximately to the 

diameter of the nail shank, forming an abutment shoulder (5), and that 
the clamping sleeve (7) is supported against the abutment shoulder (5). 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 3 characterised in 
that a metal washer (8) is arranged on the abutment shoulder (5).  

 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the clamping sleeve (7, 14) is arrested in the internal bore (4) 

of the holding portion (2a, 2b, 2c). 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 5 characterised in 
that the clamping sleeve (7) is fitted in an enlargement (12) in the 

internal bore (4) of the holding portion (2a, 2b). 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 6 characterised in 
that the enlargement (12) is open in the direction of the head plate 

(3) and the clamping sleeve (7) is arrested in the enlargement (12) by 
a cover disc (13). 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 5 characterised in 

that the clamping sleeve (14) has flanged-over portions (16) and/or 
projections (15) which engage into the wall of the internal bore (4). 
A fastening element (1) according to claim 1 characterised in 
that an anti-corrosion sheath (17) enclosing the nail shank is arranged 

at the end of the holding portion (2, 2a, 2b, 2c) which is opposite the 
head plate (3).
