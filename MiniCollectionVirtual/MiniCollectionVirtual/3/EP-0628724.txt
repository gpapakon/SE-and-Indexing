<ABSTRACT>
A suction conduit assembly (34) mounting has a plurality of retaining 
tabs (206) located 

at the open end of the suction conduit assembly (34) which mates with a 
plurality of slots 

located in a motor cover of a compressor. The plurality of tabs (206) 
are aligned with the 

plurality of slots, the suction conduit assembly (34) is assembled to 
the motor cover and 

rotated into position. An integral annular sealing ring (246) is 
located on the open end of 

the suction conduit assembly (34) spaced inward from the plurality of 
retaining tabs (206). The 

assembly of the suction conduit assembly (34) elastically deflects the 
annular sealing ring (246) 

to effect a seal between the motor cover and the suction conduit assembly as well 
as eliminating any type of noise or rattle caused by relative movement of the two 

components.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to refrigerant compressors. More 
particularly, the present invention relates to refrigerant compressors of the 
reciprocating piston type which employ a suction gas muffler for attenuating noise 
resulting from the operation of the compressor. When designing high efficiency compressors, it is important to provide 
relatively unrestricted suction gas flow to the compressor. This compressor suction 
process results in the generation of substantial noise due both to the rapid flow of 
suction gas into the compressor as well as the operation of the intake valving. 
Accordingly, it is desirable to provide some form of noise attenuating means in the 
suction gas flow path. When providing this noise attenuating means it is also 
important to overall compressor efficiency, as mentioned above, to insure a relatively 
free unrestricted flow of suction gas to the compressor. Accordingly, the use of 
various baffles and forms of restrictions in the main flow path is undesirable in that 
these device may create excessive flow losses requiring larger conduits to be utilized 
to prevent compressor suction starvation. Currently, design parameters require the compressor to be as compact as 
possible, thus limiting the available space within the assembly for a suction muffler. 
This limited available space imposes several constraints on the physical size of the 
suction mufflers. Further, because of these space limitations, it is often necessary to 
extend the suction gas conduit in close proximity to the compressor's discharge 
muffler and the compressor's discharge conduits. Accordingly, as the discharge gas  
 
is relatively hot due to the compression process, the transfer of heat from the 
discharge gas to the suction gas can occur. It is desirable to minimize this heat 
transfer to the suction gas so as to maintain a high volumetric efficiency. Accordingly, the present invention provides a refrigerant compressor having 
an improved suction gas muffler which effectively attenuates noise generated from 
the above-mentioned sources while still enabling relatively free unrestricted flow to 
the compressor. The suction gas muffler of the present invention is of the side 
branch type and comprises a relatively large diameter conduit having a housing 
secured thereto which defines a pair of side branch chambers each of which may be 
tuned to a different fundamental frequency. A pair of longitudinally spaced openings 
provide communication with each of the respective chambers and
