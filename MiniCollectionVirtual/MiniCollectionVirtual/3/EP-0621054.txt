<ABSTRACT>
In an electrode device, primarily for connecting a medical 
apparatus to living tissue, the number of solid, metal 

conductors can be reduced if the electrode device is devised 
in such a way that it comprises a sleeve (26) containing a 

fluid conductor, primarily a fluid, non-metallic conductor 
(28). The fluid conductor (28) is primarily made from a 

conductive gel or an electrolytic fluid.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electrode device comprising an
insulating sleeve in which an electrical conductor is
arranged to electrically connect a contact at a proximal
part of the electrode device to an electrode surface on the
electrode device.Electrode devices are used when e.g. a pacemaker or a
defibrillator is to be connected to a heart to sense the
heart's function or treat the heart. As a rule, these
electrode devices are composed of one or more helically
wound metal wires running from a contact at a proximal end,
connectable to the pacemaker or defibrillator, to an
electrode surface connected to or near the heart.
Such an electrode device is, for example, disclosed in
DE-A-3 640 033.
The
electrode surface can e.g. consist of a small pace
electrode, a larger intracardiac defibrillation electrode or
an epicardiac patch electrode. The electrode devices can
also be equipped with different kinds of sensors which are
connected, via a metal conductor, to the pacemaker or
defibrillator.Since the heart is in constant motion, electrode devices
connected to or near the heart are constantly exposed to
changes in load. So one or more of the metal wires could
fracture, thereby breaking the electrical connection between
an electrode surface or a sensor and the contact at the
proximal end. When a plurality of metal wires, electrically
insulated from one another, are used, the insulation could
sustain abrasion damage caused by the constantly shifting
load, causing a short-circuit. In addition, fabrication of
the electrode device becomes more complex as the number of
incorporated components increases, as when a plurality of
electrode surfaces and sensors have to be connected to one 
and the same electrode device.One object of the invention is to achieve an electrode
device, according to the introduction above, which is
capable of reliably and safely connecting the contact and
electrode surfaces electrically, or interconnecting sensors,
without the risk of fractures, short-circuits or the like and
which is implantable.Another object of the invention is to achieve an electrode
device for which the number of components can be reduced
without any reduction in the number of functions the
electrode device can perform.These objects are achieved with an implantable electrode device in
accordance with the invention in that the electrical
conductor is fluid.A fluid conductor is a completely reliable carrier of energy
and signals between the contact and electrode surface or a
sensor. A fluid conductor can withstand an
