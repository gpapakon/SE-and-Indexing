 ENCLOSURE ASSEMBLY FOR TELECOMMUNICATION CABLESField of the InventionThis invention relates to telecommunication enclosures of the type that are mounted upon poles, the exterior walls of buildings, or upon other exposed structures. The enclosure assembly is particularly, but not necessarily exclusively, adapted to receive and protect splices between telecommunications cables, such as distribution and drop wire cables.Background of the InventionU. S. Patent 5,059,748, which is owned by the assignee of the present application, discloses an enclosure assembly for splice connections between telecommunication cables. The enclosure of the prior patent includes base and cover members that are releasably interconnected by an annular clamp that is separate from such members and has arcuate sections that undergo pivotal movement relative to each other. Connection of the cover and base members of the enclosure to each other requires that the telecommunication craftsperson first pivot the clamp sections away from each other, then move them and a separate sealing ring into encircling relationship with adjacent end portions of the base and cover members, and then tighten the clamp by rotating a threaded fastener extending through lugs of the clamp. Separation of the cover and base members from each other requires a reverse sequence of the foregoing steps. Retention of the cables within generally U-shaped strain relief members associated with the patented enclosure also requires that the craftsperson secure retainer strips over the open sides of the strain relief members. 

 Summary of the InventionThe present invention provides a cable splice enclosure assembly having base and cover members that are releasably interconnected by cooperating elements that are integral with respective ones of such members. Connection of the base and cover members to each other and to a pole, building or other static structure can be quickly and easily accomplished. Disconnection of the base and cover members from each other, and/or removal of the entire enclosure from a pole or the like, can be accomplished with equal facility and speed. The improved cable splice enclosure assembly also includes strain relieving members that readily receive cables passing into and/or from the enclosure and that have open ends which do not need to be overlaid by closure members. The enclosure assembly of the invention further includes a mounting bracket that may be quickly and easily connected in of a plurality of different ways to a pole or other

<CLAIMS>
 The Claims
1. A reenterable enclosure assembly for telecommunication cables, comprising: a base member having at least one cable passageway through which a cable extends; a removable cover member overlying said base member; a pair of cable strain-relieving members underlying said cable passageway of said base, said cable strain-relieving members being spaced vertically from each other, each of said strain- relieving members being of generally u-shaped configuration and having an open end through which said cable passes during lateral movement thereof into said strain-relieving member.
2. An assembly as in Claim 1, wherein said strain- relieving members face in different directions from each other.
3. An assembly as in claim 1, wherein said strain- relieving members are substantially parallel.
4. An assembly as in Claim 1, wherein a first one of said strain-relieving members limits lateral movement of said cable in a first direction, and a second one of said strain-relieving members limits lateral movement of said cable in a second direction different from said first direction.
5. An assembly as in Claim 1, wherein said strain- relieving members extend in transverse relationship to said cable.
6. An assembly as in Claim 1, wherein said base member has a plurality of cable passageways extending therethrough, and wherein a pair of said strain-relieving members underlies each of said cable passageways. 


 7. An assembly as in Claim 6, wherein said cable passageways include a first cable passageway of relatively large diameter and a second passageway of relatively small diameter.
8. An assembly as in Claim 7, wherein said strain- relieving members include a first pair of relatively large size underlying said first mentioned cable passageway, and a second pair of relatively small size underlying said second cable passageway.
9. An assembly as in Claim 1, wherein said base member includes a plurality of sections that are pivotally moveable relative to each other and contain protective sealant material engaging said cable and resisting entry of moisture and debris into said cable passageway.
10. An assembly as in Claim 1, wherein end portions of said upper and lower strain-relieving members overlap each other as viewed in plan.
11. An assembly as in Claim 1, wherein said strain relieving members collectively extend around more than the entire circumference of said cable.
12. An assembly as in Claim 1, and further including connecting means upon said base member and upon said cover member for in a first relative rotative position of said members connecting said members to each other, and in a second relative rotative position thereof permitting removal of said cover member from said base member.
13. An assembly as in Claim 12, wherein said cover member has a generally circular lower edge portion and said connecting means includes latch elements carried by and extending downwardly from said lower edge portion of said cover 


member at spaced locations about the circumference of said edge portion of said cover member.
14. An assembly as in Claim 13, wherein said base member is of generally circular shape and said connecting means further includes flange elements carried by and extending outwardly from said base member at spaced locations about the circumference thereof, said latch elements and said flange elements engaging each other and securing said cover member and said base member together in a first relative rotative position of said members, and said latch members and said flange members being out of engagement with each other and permitting removal of said cover member from said base member in another relative rotative position of said members.
15. An assembly as in Claim 14, and further including detent elements upon one of said flange elements of said base member, said detent elements impeding relative rotative movement of said base and cover members from said first relative rotative position thereof.
16. An assembly as in Claim 15, wherein said latch elements are of generally L-shaped configuration.
17. An assembly as in Claim 1, and further including a mounting bracket adapted to be affixed to a static structure, and a support bracket connectable to and disconnectable from said mounting bracket, said base member and said cable strain- relieving member being connected to and supported by said support bracket.
18. An assembly as in Claim 17, wherein said mounting bracket includes a plate member having rearwardly extending opposite side edge sections having openings therein for receiving fastener elements; and a central section having generally L-shaped 


"PAGE MISSING AT TIME OF PUBLICATION" 

23. An enclosure assembly as in Claim 22, wherein said connecting means includes at least one latch element carried by and projecting from one end of one of said base and cover members, and at least one cooperating element upon the other of said members.
24. An enclosure assembly as in Claim 23, wherein said latch element upon said one of said members is resiliently flexible and includes a free end portion having a cam surface and a shoulder.
25. An enclosure assembly as in Claim 24, wherein said cooperating element upon the other of said members includes a flange projecting outwardly from said other of said members.
