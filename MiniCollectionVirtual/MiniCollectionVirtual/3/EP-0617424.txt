<ABSTRACT>
A head assembly is disclosed for use in a system for optically or magnetically 
recording data on a data storage medium in a number of successively recorded, adjacent 

data tracks, and for reading the recorded data from the storage medium, wherein the 
head assembly and the data storage medium are movable relative to each other along 

a transport direction substantially parallel to the data tracks. The head assembly has a 
carrier with at least one write head mounted thereon and having a center line extending 

substantially parallel to the transport direction, and at least one read head also mounted 
on the carrier and having a center line extending substantially parallel to the transport 

direction. The center line of the read head is offset from the center line of the write head 
in a direction substantially perpendicular to the transport direction by a distance which is 

selected for causing the read head to read data from a data track adjacent a data track 
in which data is currently being written by the write head in the same pass with the writing 

of the data by the write head. This permits virtually immediate detection of overwriting of 
the data by the write head onto the adjacent data track.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a head system, having at least one write head 
and at least one read head mounted on a carrier, for use in high-density recording 
devices wherein data is magnetically or optically stored in adjacent data tracks, with the 
data tracks being successively recorded, and wherein the head system and the storage 
medium are relatively movable. Designers of data storage systems, such as magnetical or optical disk or tape 
storage systems, are continuously seeking ways to increase the data storage capabilities 
within the confines of a given system. Normally, if the area available for recording data 
is fixed, the storage capacity is increased either by increasing the linear bit density (flux 
density) or the track density (number of recorded tracks per mm or per inch) or a 
combination of both. Given a choice, the designer will usually choose to increase the 
track density, rather than increasing the linear bit density. This is because the signal-to-noise 
ratio (S/N) is reduced linearly by an increase in track density, but is reduced 
exponentially with an increase in bit density. Increasing the track density, however, may present other problems making this 
choice more difficult to implement in a practical system. For example, in a magnetic tape 
system such as those based on quarter inch tape cartridges (QIC), the practical number 
of tracks recorded longitudinally (along the length of the tape in the tape transport 
direction) has been very low, normally less than 30 tracks. Recently, some improvements 
have permitted an increase in the number of tracks to slightly above 40.  In a tape system such as the QIC cartridge, one of the limiting factors for higher 
track densities is the precision and the repeatability of the tape position as the tape 
moves relative to the write/read head assembly, often at very high speeds The tape is 
manufactured from a sheet of material which is then cut (slitted) to produce strips which 
will form the magnetic tape. Such slitting is done with very tight tolerances. While 
running, the tape is maintained in place in a direction perpendicular to its transport 
direction by tape guides, schematically shown in Figure 1. Due to tolerances in the tape 
width arising during the manufacture thereof, and tolerances in the tape guides, the tape 
may nonetheless be able to travel slightly up or down (i.e., perpendicularly to its transport 
direction) from its correct or specified position while it is running. Expensive tape systems 
often use tape
