<DESCRIPTION>
This invention pertains to a novel process for the 
conversion of γ,δ-epoxyalkenes and γ,δ-epoxycycloalkenes 
to the corresponding epoxyalkanes and epoxycycloalkanes. 
More specifically, this invention pertains to the 
catalytic hydrogenation of γ,δ-epoxyalkenes and γ,δ-epoxycycloalkenes 
by means of a rhodium catalyst whereby 
the olefinic unsaturation is hydrogenated without 
significant hydrogenolysis of the conjugated epoxy 
group. U.S. Patent 4,897,498 describes an efficient 
process for the preparation of γ,δ-epoxyalkenes by the 
selective monoepoxidation of dienes, e.g., 3,4-epoxy-1-butene 
from butadiene. A valuable compound which may be 
obtained from 3,4-epoxy-1-butene is 1,2-epoxybutane, 
also referred to in the literature as 1,2-butylene oxide 
or butylene oxide. According to Rylander, Catalytic Hydrogenation Over 
Platinum Metals, Academic Press, New York, page 478 
(1967), epoxides, with a few exceptions (Berson and 
Suzuki, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 80, 4341 [1958]), readily 
undergo hydrogenolysis over platinum metal catalysts and 
the major product is usually an alcohol or mixture of 
alcohols resulting from cleavage of a carbon-oxygen 
bond; other products may arise by cleavage of the 
carbon-carbon bond and by loss of the oxygen function. The catalytic hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene 
to butyraldehyde over palladium and to 1-butanol over 
Raney nickel is described in U.S. Patent 2,561,984. No 
mention is made of the use of rhodium catalysts nor the 
observation of 1,2-epoxybutane formation. The 
hydrogenation of 3,4-epoxy-1-butene also has been 
reported by Russian workers in Zh. Obshch. Khim., 28,  
 
3046 and 3051 (1958). They hydrogenated 3,4-epoxy-1-butene 
in methanol or ethanol with platinum, palladium, 
and Raney nickel catalysts to give 1-butanol. They 
state that crotyl alcohol was the principal intermediate 
in the reduction, although butyraldehyde was also 
observed. Selective double bond hydrogenation was not 
observed in any example. Rhodium has been reported (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 83, 
3096 [1961]) to be effective for a double bond reduction 
in the presence of an epoxide group in a fumagillin 
derivative. In this literature example, however, the 
epoxide is trisubstituted and less prone to hydrogenolysis 
due to steric hindrance. Additionally the double 
bond and epoxide were not conjugated as they are in 
3,4-epoxy-1-butene. By the term "conjugated" is meant 
that the carbon-carbon double bond and the epoxide group 
are adjacent, or stated another way, the epoxide oxygen 
is
