<ABSTRACT>
An electronic notepad which has a plurality of panels (11) connected together at one side of each thereof so that the panels 
can be spread freely, a display means (12) provided with sheet type displays arranged on the surfaces of the panels to show images, 

a memory (24) for storing data to be displayed by the display means (12), sensors (13) for detecting the positions in which 
data is input on 
the display by handwriting, and a write control means (31) adapted to send a signal for setting the picture elements 
in the writing positions, which were detected by the sensors (13), on the displays on the panels in a predetermined displaying 

state, and show the picture elements in a displaying state on the displays.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an electronic notebook which is 
capable of handling data of documents, drawings, etc., as usual 
notebooks and is very useful for achieving a paperless office. In recent years, personal computers, word processors, 
electronic pocketbooks, etc., have become popular as electronic 
machines for inputting, recording, and outputting documents, 
drawings, or the like without using paper or writing tools. 
However, with the electronic machines, usually data is input with 
key switches, etc., and displayed on a single screen for output. Thus, the electronic machines do not enable anybody to 
easily write (input) data whenever necessary or see the contents 
written (recorded) on a plurality of pages at a time while 
comparing them. From this point of view, the electric machines 
are inferior to usual notebooks, books, etc., in convenience. For 
this reason, at offices where electronic machines as mentioned 
above are introduced, in fact, the contents output by the electronic 
machines are printed out on paper for reference or the electronic  
 
machines and paper notebooks, ledgers, etc., are used together for 
business processing. Electronic pictures or illustrated books using floppy disk as 
media are also now on the market. However, they are hard to 
handle or have a narrow display range and have not become 
popular; in actual fact, books using normal paper are still 
published in large quantities. Therefore, although the electronic machines as described 
above have been developed and have become widely popular, the 
amount of paper consumed has not decreased. In fact, it has 
increased because printout paper is thrown away. As a result, an 
acute social problem arises from the viewpoints of garbage 
processing and resource protection. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide an 
electronic notebook which enables anybody to easily write 
whenever necessary and see the wide range of recorded contents 
while comparing them in a sense of turning over leaves like a 
notebook or a book with paper pages. To these ends, according to one form of the invention, there 
is provided an electronic notebook comprising:
 
   a plurality of panels bound on one side so that they can be 
spread;
 
 
a plurality of display means having a thin-plate-like display disposed on a 
spread face of each of the panels for displaying an image on the 
display;
 
   a memory for storing data for display by the display means;
 
   a sensor for detecting a write position of a handwriting 
operation
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
An electronic notebook comprising: 
   a plurality of panels bound on one side so that they can be 

spread; 
a plurality of display means having a thin-plate-like display disposed on a 

spread face of each of said panels for displaying an image on said 
display; 

   a memory for storing data for display by said display means; 
   a sensor for detecting a write position of a handwriting 

operation onto a screen displayed on said display; and 
   write control means responsive to the write position 

detected by said sensor for sending a signal, to place a picture 
element at the write position on said display where the writing 

has been made in a predetermined display state, to said display 
means for displaying a write state. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 1 wherein 
said memory can be provided with a storage area corresponding 

to the display of each of said panels and image data written by 
write operation on each panel is stored in the corresponding area 

of said memory. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 2 wherein 
said memory further has a document data storage area. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 3 further 
including display control means for controlling so that document 

data and image data stored in said memory and to be displayed on 
the same page are displayed on the same display. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 3 wherein 
said sensor has pressure-sensitive sensors for detecting a pressing 

action and said pressure-sensitive sensors have pressure-sensitive 
points disposed like a matrix on the display. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 5 wherein an 
area for menu selection is displayed on a part of the display of 

each panel. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 4 further 
including rewrite means for converting image data representing a 

handwritten character into code data and storing the code data in 
said memory as document data. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 7 wherein 
said rewrite means erases the image data converted into the code 

data and sends the code data to said display means for displaying 
it. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 4 further 
including page specification means operatively installed in a part 

 
of at least any one of said plurality of panels for accepting 

specification of a page to be displayed on the display. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 9 wherein 
said display control means selects the page specified with said 

page specification means from among the document data stored in 
said memory and sends it to said display means for displaying on 

the corresponding display. 
The electronic notebook as claimed in claim 9 wherein 
said page specification means further includes a page feed switch 

for instructing pages of document data displayed on said plurality 
of display means to be shifted to contiguous display means one 

page at a time in sequence for displaying.
