<ABSTRACT>
A method for stress-relieving a 
compression-moulded magnetic body is provided for 

purposes of enhancing the magnetic permeability of the 
magnetic body. The method involves encapsulating 

ferromagnetic particles with a preferred polymeric 
coating material, comprising either a 

polybenzimidazole or a polyimide derived from either 
3-4' oxydianiline or polymethylene dianiline. The 

preferred coating materials are capable of 
withstanding elevated temperatures for a duration 

which is sufficient to anneal the magnetic body formed 
from the coated metal particles. As a result, the 

stresses induced in the magnetic core by the 
compression-moulding process can be relieved without 

detriment to the mechanical properties and magnetic 
characteristics of the magnetic core.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a 
method as specified in the preamble of claim 4, for 
enhancing the magnetic permeability of an article 
formed from coated ferromagnetic particles as 
specified in the preamble of claim 1. More 
particularly, this invention relates to a method in 
which a compression-moulded magnetic article is formed 
from ferromagnetic particles which are coated with a 
polymeric material, and then annealed so as to 
substantially relieve the stresses induced in the 
magnetic article during the compression-moulding 
process without significantly deteriorating the 
polymeric coating material, such that the magnetic 
article exhibits enhanced magnetic permeability 
without a significant loss in mechanical properties. The use of powdered metals, and particularly 
iron and its alloys, is known for forming magnets, 
such as soft magnetic AC cores for transformers, 
inductors, motors, generators, and relays. An 
advantage to using powdered metals is that forming 
operations, such as compression, injection-moulding, 
or isostatic pressing techniques, can be used to form 
intricate moulded part configurations, such as 
magnetic cores, without the requirement for additional 
machining and/or piercing operations. As a result, 
the formed part is often substantially ready for use 
within its working environment as formed by the 
moulding process. Moulded magnetic cores for AC applications 
generally should have low magnetic core losses. To 
provide low core losses, the individual metal 
particles within the magnetic core must be 
electrically insulated from each other. Numerous 
types of insulating materials, which also act as the  
 
binder required for moulding, have been suggested by 
the prior art, including inorganic materials such as 
iron phosphate and alkali metal silicates, as well as 
an extensive variety of organic polymeric materials. 
It is also known to coat a powdered metal with an 
inorganic undercoating and then provide an organic 
topcoat. In addition to providing adequate insulation 
and adhesion between the metal particles upon 
moulding, the coating material should also have the 
ability to provide sufficient lubrication during the 
moulding operation so as to enhance the flowability 
and compressibility of the particles, therefore 
enabling the moulded product to attain maximum density 
and strength. A shortcoming of the prior art arises in 
that the maximum operating temperature of a magnetic 
core will often be determined by the heat-resistant 
properties of
