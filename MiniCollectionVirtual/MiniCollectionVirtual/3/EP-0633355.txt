<ABSTRACT>
A track sweeping machine (1) is equipped with a machine frame (5) supported on rail running gear (6, 8) and with sweeping brushes (10, 15, 16) connected height-adjustably to said machine frame, spaced apart from one another in the longitudinal direction of the machine and each comprising a rotary shaft (39) running perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the machine and having radially projecting, flexible sweeping elements (32). The foremost or first sweeping brush (10) in the working direction of the machine (1), of a total of three sweeping brushes (10, 15, 16) spaced apart from one another in the longitudinal direction of the machine, is associated with a conveyor belt (11) which runs in the longitudinal direction of the machine and whose higher-situated throwing-off end (37) is positioned above a ballast store (12) comprising discharging openings (13). Each sweeping brush (10, 15, 16) has arranged directly in front of it a transverse conveyor belt (19) running perpendicularly to the longitudinal direction of the machine.

A sweeper machine for sweeping a track, comprising a
machine frame (5) supported on on-track undercarriages (6,8)

and sweeper brushes (10,15,16) vertically adjustably
connected to the said machine frame, arranged at a distance

from one another in the longitudinal direction of the machine
and each having a rotating shaft (39) extending at right

angles to the longitudinal direction of the machine with
radially 
projecting, flexible sweeper elements (32),
characterized in that associated with the front or first

sweeper brush (10), in the operating direction of the
machine, of a total of at least three sweeper brushes (10,

15,16) arranged at a distance from one another in the
longitudinal direction of the machine is a conveyor belt

(11), extending in the longitudinal direction of the machine,
of which the elevated discharge end (37) is positioned over a

ballast store (12) having discharge openings (13), and in
that immediately preceding each sweeper brush (10,15,16) is a

lateral conveyor belt (19) extending at right angles to the
longitudinal direction of the machine.
A sweeper machine according to claim 1, characterized
in that each sweeper brush (10,15,16) is linked to the

machine frame (5) by universally mobile articulated
connections (17) and may be supported on the track by flanged

rollers (21).
A sweeper machine according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that the machine frame (5) is composed of
two frame parts (3,4) joined together by an articulated

connection (7) and each designed to be recessed upwardly,
the ballast store (12) and the first sweeper brush (10)

being associated with the front, first frame part (3) in the
operating direction. 
A sweeper machine according to claim 3, characterized
in that the two frame parts (3,4) are supported in the region

of the articulated connection (7) on a common on-track
undercarriage (6).
A sweeper machine according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that the articulated connection (17) for

attaching the sweeper brushes (10,15,16) to the machine frame
(5) is in each case designed as a parallelogram linkage.
A sweeper machine according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterized in that preceding the front, first sweeper

brush (10) in the operating direction is a grading blade
(14), secured to the machine frame (5) so as to be vertically

adjustable.
A sweeper machine according to claim 6, characterized in
that the grading blade (14) is arranged between the front,

first sweeper brush (10), in the operating direction, and the
ballast store (12) or the discharge openings (13) thereof.
A sweeper machine according to one of claims 1 to 7,
characterized in that the three sweeper brushes (10,15,16)

each have a rotary body (33) which is shaped differently
and is formed by end surfaces (38) of the flexible sweeper

elements (35).
A sweeper machine according to claim 8, characterized in
that the rotary body (33) at least of the rearmost sweeper

brush (16) in the operating direction of the machine has a
central part (35) located between the rails (24) of the track

(2), of which the sweeper elements (32) are designed so as to
be longer than those of the brush sections (36) adjoining the

central part (35). 
A sweeper machine according to claim 1 or 2,

characterized in that the two rear sweeper brushes (15,16) in
the operating direction are secured to a trailer frame (29),

supported at its rear end on an on-track undercarriage (8),
the front end of which is linked, forming an articulation

point (7), to a frame section (28) of the machine frame (5)
which projects over the undercarriage (6) of the machine (1)

and which is recessed upwardly to accomodate the first
sweeper brush (10).
