<ABSTRACT>
In order to produce an integrated circuit, the construction of a design for the circuit which comprises a plurality of MOS transistors is controlled by using a circuit simulator. In the circuit simulator, Ids, Q,  @ and @ are calculated for the connection points of the MOS transistors, with specification of the voltages between gate and source Vgs, between drain and source Vds and between the substrate and source Vbs in a consistent transistor model, in which drift, diffusion and short-channel effects are taken into account.
