<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a voltage-to-current
conversion circuit and, more particularly, to such a circuit as
utilizing insulated gate field effect (MOS) transistors.A voltage-to-current conversion circuit is essential to a
signal processing circuit handling an analog signal and thus is
widely employed therein. This circuit fundamentally uses a
current mirror circuit composed of transistors. There are two
types in such a circuit, a bipolar type and a MOS type.The voltage-to-current conversion circuit of the bipolar
type is typically disclosed in US-A-4 560 920.
The basic circuit construction thereof is shown in
Fig. 3 attached herewith (and corresponds to Fig. 5 of the above
patent No.). Specifically, this circuit includes a current
mirror circuit composed of PNP bipolar transistors 20 and 22, an
input resistor 60, a constant current source composed of an NPN
bipolar transistor 21, a resistor 61 and a constant voltage
source 80, and an operational amplifier 40 which are connected
as shown. The amplifier 40 cooperates with the transistor 20 to
form a strong negative feedback loop. Accordingly, the current
flowing through the resistor 60 in response to an input signal
voltage supplied to an input terminal 90 is determined by the
resistance value of the resistor 60 and the voltage amplitude of
the input signal voltage. This current is supplied to the
transistor 20 and thus derived from an output terminal 91 through
the transistor 22 as the mirror current. The voltage-to-current
conversion is thus attained. This circuit can handle a 
relatively large input voltage and further operate under a
relatively low power voltage (1.8 V).The conversion circuit of the MOS type shown in Fig. 4 is
also known in the art. This circuit also includes
a current mirror circuit composed of P-channel MOS transistors
30 and 32 and an operational amplifier 41. However, this circuit
converts the input signal voltage into the current by an N-channel
MOS transistor 31, a resistor 62 and the amplifier 41 and
then produces the converted current through the current mirror
circuit. Specifically, the negative feedback loop composed of
the transistor 31 and the amplifier 41 causes the input signal
voltage to appear across the resistor 62. The current determined
by the resistance value of the resistor 62 and the voltage
amplitude is thereby derived from the output terminal 91 through
the transistor 31 and the current mirror circuit. This prior art
circuit is advantageous in having a high input impedance due to
the operational
