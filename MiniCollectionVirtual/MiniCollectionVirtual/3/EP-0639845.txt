<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a four-pole differential circuit breaker comprising a differential sensor arranged so as to detect a leakage current, a control device connected to the sensor and a mechanism for triggering the contacts of the circuit breaker. The triggering mechanism includes a switching bar (16) which carries moving contacts (15a, 15b, 15c, 15d). It is equipped, moreover, with two swellings (18, 19) which act in the manner of cams on the moving contacts (15a, 15d) in such a way that the spacing between these contacts with respect to the corresponding fixed contacts (14a, 14d) is less than that of the moving contacts (15b, 15c) with respect to their fixed contacts (14b, 14c). That being so, the following authorised sequences for closing the contacts in the event of leak detection are adhered to:  neutral - phase - phase - phase or phase - neutral - phase - phase.

<CLAIMS>
A four-pole differential switch equipped with four stationary contacts (14a, 14b, 14c,
14d) and four corresponding movable contacts (15a, 15b, 15c, 15d) disposed in line

and comprising a differential sensor arranged to detect a leakage current and to
transmit a corresponding signal to an operating device connected to said sensor, this

device being coupled to a trip mechanism (17) to actuate a switching bar bearing the
movable contacts of the switch, characterized in that said bar (16) comprises means

for reducing the distance between the movable contacts (15a, 15d) and the
corresponding stationary contacts (14a, 14d) located at the two ends of said line of

contacts.
The switch according to claim 1, characterized in that said means comprise
peripheral bosses (18, 19) arranged on the switching bar (16).
The switch according to claim 2, characterized in that said bosses are achieved by
casting or machining and are integrated in the switching bar.
The switch according to claim 2, characterized in that said bosses are constituted
by add-on elements.
