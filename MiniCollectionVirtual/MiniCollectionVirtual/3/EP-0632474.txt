<ABSTRACT>
A control and/or signalling unit having screw terminals, including a single-piece body (1) forming a collar provided with an external threading allowing mounting by a nut onto a support and enclosed at the rear by a cap (2) pierced with openings for cabling wires to pass through and for access to the screws (61a, 61b, 71a, 71b) the axes of which are parallel to the axis (X-X') of symmetry of the body (1), characterised in that the screws (61a, 61b, 71a, 71b) interact with connecting regions of conducting parts (6a, 6b, 7a, 7b) which are folded and held eccentrically with respect to the axis of symmetry in the body (1), the latter forming a cylindrical inner housing (13) which is open on the conducting piece side so as to let through at least one pusher (4) of moveable contacts and a light component (8).

Screw terminal and/or signaling unit,
comprising a single-piece body (1) forming a flange

provided with an exterior threading allowing assembly
by nut on a support and enveloped at the rear by a

cover (2) cut by openings for the passage of connecting
wires and access to screws (61a, 61b, 71a, 71b) whose

axes are parallel to the axis (X-X') of symmetry of the
body (1), 
characterized in that
:

the body has a cylindrical inner housing (13)
that houses conductive parts (6a, 6b, 7a, 7b) fitted

with fixed contacts which are folded and maintained, in
eccentric fashion, in relation to the axis of symmetry,

and fitted with connection areas for screws (61a, 61b,
71a, 71b).
the unit includes at least one movable contact
push button (4) that cooperates with the fixed contacts

of the conductive parts or such a movable contact push
button (4) with a luminous component (8) and conductive

parts (7a, 7b) used to supply the luminous component
(8).
this inner housing (13) is open at the side of
the conductive parts and allows passage of said push

button (4).
Unit according to claim 1, 
characterized in
that
 the body (1) guides in translatory motion, in its
housing (13), a hollow cylindrical movable push-button

(4) fitted with at least one lateral prolongation
forming a cage (42) in which a bridge contact (9) is

fitted cooperating with contacts fixed to the
conductive parts (6a, 6b). 
unit according to claim 2, 
characterized in
that
 it comprises four conductive parts (6a, 6b) fitted
with fixed contacts and that the push button (4)

comprises two lateral cage prolongations (42) for two
contact bridges (9).
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it comprises two
conductive parts (6a) fitted with fixed contacts and

two conductive parts (7a, 7b) for the supply of a
luminous component (8).
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a cap (2)
enveloping the rear of the body and pierced, laterally,

by spaces (23, 24) allowing the passage of the
conductors to be connected on the terminals (61a, 61b,

71a, 71b) and, at the rear, by openings (21, 22)
adapted to allow the passage of a tool for tightening

the screws (61a, 61b, 71a, 71b).
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the body comprises, at
the rear, a frame (14, 15) formed by two longitudinal

rods (14) joined to each other by a bracing (15) and
serving to carry the conductive parts (6a, 6b, 7a, 7b).
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the push button (4)
comprises a prolongation forming the cage (42) for a

contact bridge (9) and houses a bulb (8) connected to
two terminals.
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 it comprises a luminous
base component (8) fitted in a lampholder (75) forming

part of a conductive part (7a). 
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the conductive parts (6a,
6b) cooperating with the contact bridges (9) are U-shaped.
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 the screws (61a, 61b,
71a, 71b) are associated with clamps (62a, 62b, 72a,

72b) that have a polygonal or octagonal external form
adapted to assembly in a cap (2) covering the rear of

the body.
Unit according to any one of the preceding
claims, 
characterized in that
 a detachable key (46) is
fixed at the front of the push button (4).
