<ABSTRACT>
A display means and panels comprising corrugated or fluted sheet material having display and support surfaces in which cuts or slits (6) are made in one or both surfaces so as to make the material rollable. The plurality of slits or cut-outs (6) are in the same axis as the corrugations or flutes. The cuts or slits in the display means and panels may be formed by means of a cutting tool adapted to slit or cut the corrugated or fluted sheet material. A guide can control the one or more blades of the cutting tool into contact with the one or more respective corrugations of flutes. A cutting tool is also claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to improvements in displaying
means and panels and means of cutting display means and
panels therefor and more particularly, but not exclusively
to a sheet-type material and cutting tool therefor.To the present time, various types of display devices
and panels have been commercially available but to varying
degrees have suffered from the disadvantage of being heavy
and cumbersome and difficult to store and transport. In
particular, existing display devices and panels may be
heavy and require backing to the sheet material or other
inflexible substrate to maintain its rigidity.
Furthermore, the frames necessary to house such displays
and panels may themselves be heavy and expensive and
accordingly difficult to transport and erect. In the case
of display devices used in exhibitions and the like, the
visual presentation is important and while certain display
devices currently available meet certain expectations in
the marketplace, the advantages referred to above, make
them unwieldly and expensive.US-A-4794712 describes a display panel having a first
and second surface separated by spacer members to define
generally parallel channels between the first and second
surfaces. The panel is made from rigid multilayer
corrugated fibreboard and is scored across the corrugations
to enable the outer quarters to be folded inwards to
enclose and protect material displayed in it during
transport and storage. According to this invention a panel having a first
surface and a second surface, the first and second surfaces
being separated by spacer members to define generally
parallel channels between the first and second surfaces, is
characterised in that at least one of the first and second
surfaces includes a plurality of elongate cut-outs or slits
extending along the entire length of and generally parallel
to the channels and arranged to allow the panel to be
rolled or deformably erected.According to a second aspect of this invention a
display means comprises a panel in accordance with the
first aspect of this invention wherein an adhesive means is
applied to any one of the first and second surfaces and
thereafter a print or other image substrate is adhered to
the said surface.The present invention provides a simple and effective
display means which is able to provide in use a
substantially rigid surface to carry the necessary display,
but which can be readily transported and stored.According to a third aspect of the present invention
a cutting tool for slitting or cutting slits or cutouts in
a

<CLAIMS>
A panel (1) having a first surface (3) and a second
surface (4), the first and second surfaces (3,4) being

separated by spacer members (7) to define generally
parallel channels (2) between the first and second surfaces

(3,4), characterised in that at least one of the first and
second surfaces (3,4) includes a plurality of elongate cut-outs

or slits (6) extending along the entire length of and
generally parallel to the channels (2) and arranged to

allow the panel (1) to be rolled or deformably erected.
A panel (1) according to claim 1, wherein the cut-outs
or slits (6) are provided on both the first and second

surfaces (3,4) of the said panel (1) such that the cut-outs
or slits (6) are alternated on either surface.
A panel (1) according to claim 1 or 2, wherein the
cut-outs or slits (6) have a width ranging from

approximately 0.1mm to 2mm.
A panel (1) according to any one of the preceding
claims, in which the width of the cut-outs or slits (6) are

varied to control the degree to which the panel (1) may be
rolled.
A display means comprising a panel (1) according to
any one of the preceding claims, wherein an adhesive means

is applied to any one of the first and second surfaces (3)
and thereafter a print or other image substrate (8) is

adhered to the said surface (3). 
A display means according to claim 5, in which said
adhesive means comprises a carrier sheet (10) coated on

both sides with adhesive.
A display means according to claim 6, in which the
print or image substrate (8) comprises a laminated material

in which the grain of the said laminated material is
substantially at right angles to the cut-outs or slits (6)

in the panel (1).
A display means according to any one of claims 5 to 7,
wherein a fastening means (5) is provided on the other of

the first and second surfaces (4) to secure the display
means to a rigid support.
A cutting tool (19) for slitting or cutting slits or
cut-outs (6) in a panel (1) according to claims 1 to 4

comprising a guide member (13) engageable within at least
one channel (2), and at least two blades (11a,11b) spaced

apart on said cutting tool, said blades (11a,11b)
positionable by said guide means (13) to engage with and in

use slit or cut the surface of said panel (2).
A cutting tool (19) according to claim 9, having a
plurality of pairs of cutting blades (11a,11b) positioned

substantially parallel to each other and adapted to
simultaneously form a plurality of cut-outs or slits (2).
A cutting tool (19) according to claim 9 or 10,
wherein the said blades (11a,11b) on each cutting tool are

positioned to allow variation in the size of the cut-outs
or slits (6). 
A cutting tool according to claim 9, 10 or 11, in
which the angle of each blade means (11) can be varied.
A cutting tool (19) according to any of claims 9 to
12, in which each blade (11) includes a curved or arcuate

portion.
A cutting tool (19) according to any one of claims 9
to 13, having a contoured material guide (14) which, in

use, forces cut material to spiral up so that the cutting
tool (19) does not become clogged by it.
