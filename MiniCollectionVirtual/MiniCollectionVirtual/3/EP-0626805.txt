<ABSTRACT>
The present invention includes a method for preventing or treating the toxic effects of a superantigen. A subject is treated with a molecule which interacts with specific V beta  elements of T cells in a manner similar to that of a native superantigen. The molecules of the present invention are mutated or modified superantigens which elicit antibody production without inducing T cell proliferation.

<DESCRIPTION>
 fPROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF MUTATED SUPERANTIGENSFIELD OF THE INVENTION5 This invention relates to methods for preventing^ and treating antigen-mediated and antigen-initiated diseases. Specifically, it relates to providing protection against superantigen pathogens by administration of molecules which are modified or10 mutated superantigens which elicit a antibody response against the superantigen without having the pathological effect of the superantigen. The molecules of this invention may also interact with the V3 elements of T cell receptors in a way which leads to15 modifications in the way T cells respond to an antigen.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThe vertebrate immune system evolved to protect vertebrates from infection by microorganisms and large20 parasites. The immune system responds to antigens in one of two ways: (1) humoral antibody responses, mediated through B cells, involving the production of protein antibodies which circulate in the bloodstream and bind specifically to the foreign antigen which25 induced them. The binding of the antibody to the antigen makes it easier for phagocytic cells to ingest the antigen and often activates a system of blood proteins, collectively called complement, that helps destroy the antigen; and (2) cell-mediated immune30 responses, mediated through T cells, involving the production of specialized cells that react mainly with foreign antigens on the surface of host cells, either killing the host cell if the antigen is an infecting virus or inducing other host cells, such as35 macrophages, to destroy the antigen (Molecular Biology of the Cell (1983), B. Alberts et al. (eds) , chapter 17, pp. 952) .The production of antibodies requires a number of preceding events to occur which lead to stimulation of 

B cells producing the antibodies. One of the key events involved in the processes leading to antibody production is that of antigen recognition. Antigen recognition requires the participation of thy us (T) cells.T cells have antigen-specific receptors on their surfaces, termed T cell antigen receptors (TCR) . Before T cells can recognize protein antigens, the antigens must be presented on the surface of antigen- presenting cells. The antigens must first be processed by macrophages or other antigen presenting cells. These cells essentially swallow antigens and chop them into peptides which are displayed at the cell surface in combination with major histocompability complex (MHC) molecules.The major histocompatibility antigens are a family of antigens encoded by a
