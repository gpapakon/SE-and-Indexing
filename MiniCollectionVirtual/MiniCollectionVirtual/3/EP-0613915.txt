<ABSTRACT>
Unsaturated polyurethanes containing from 20 to 80 % by weight of polyethylene glycol units, obtainable by reacting     a) at least one organic polyisocyanate, b) an unsaturated fatty alcohol, a polyalkylene glycol ether thereof or a hydroxyl-containing ester of unsaturated acids, c) one or more diols additionally containing at least one further hydroxyl group or carboxyl group, and d) a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight in the range from 750 to 10,000, with observance of an NCO/OH equivalent ratio, based on all starting components a) to d), of from 0.7 : 1 to 1.2 : 1. These unsaturated polyurethanes are used as reactive emulsifiers for the preparation of dispersions of hydrophobic synthetic resins which can be cured by means of free radicals and/or oxidatively.

<CLAIMS>
Unsaturated polyurethanes which contain from 20 to 
80% by weight of polyethylene glycol units and can 

be prepared by reacting 

a) at least one organic polyisocyanate, 
b) an unsaturated fatty alcohol, a polyalkylene 
glycol ether thereof or an unsaturated acid ester 

containing one hydroxyl group, 
c) one or more diols which additionally contain at 
least one further hydroxyl group or carboxyl 

group and 
d) a polyethylene glycol having a molar mass in the 
range from 750 to 10,000, 
 
with maintenance of an NCO/OH equivalent ratio, 

based on all the starting components a) to d), of 
from 0.7:1 to 1.2:1. 
Polyurethanes as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that component b) 
is polyunsaturated. 
Polyurethanes as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that component b) is a (meth)acrylate of a diol. 
Polyurethanes as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that component b) is a polyethylene glycol ether 

of an unsaturated C

-fatty alcohol. 
Polyurethanes as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that component b) is a product of the reaction of 

an unsaturated fatty acid with glycidyl versatate. 
Polyurethanes as claimed in claim 1, characterized 
in that the higher-functional component c) is a 

bishydroxyalkane carboxylic acid.  
 
The use of the polyurethanes of claim 1 as reactive 
emulsifiers for hydrophobic synthetic resins which 

can be cured by means of a free-radical reaction 
and/or oxidatively, in the preparation of aqueous 

synthetic resin dispersions. 
An aqueous dispersion of hydrophobic synthetic 
resins which can be cured by means of a free-radical 

reaction and/or oxdidatively, which contains an 
unsaturated polyurethane as claimed in claim 1.
