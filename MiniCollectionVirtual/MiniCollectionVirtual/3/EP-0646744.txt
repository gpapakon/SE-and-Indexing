<ABSTRACT>
In a pressure regulating system for a fire extinguishing equipment according to the invention, a main valve 
isolates primary and secondary sides of the body of a pressure regulating valve from each other, and a valve chest 

is defined behind the main valve for communicating to the primary side. Also, a pressure regulating pilot valve is 
constructed such that a valve disc is provided in the valve chest, into which a primary side pressure is introduced, to 

be pressed against a valve seat by a biasing means, and the pressure bearing area of a first surface, which is subjected 
to pressure in a valve opening direction of the valve disc, is substantially equal to that of a second surface, which is 

subjected to pressure in a valve closing direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a pressure regulating system
for fire extinguishing facility to be used, for example, in a
sprinkler fire extinguishing facility.In the sprinkler fire extinguishing facility of a
high-rise building, a pressure regulating system having a
pressure regulating valve and a pressure regulating pilot valve
is provided to regulate the water pressure to be supplied to
sprinkler heads. By operation of the pressure regulating pilot
valve, the interior of a secondary side piping of the pressure
regulating valve is regulated to a steady pressure.The degree of opening of a conventional pressure
regulating valve is regulated by a spring for urging it toward
the direction of closing of the valve and a piston fixed to the
valve. This piston is fitted in a cylinder and the cylinder is
connected to a secondary side of the pressure regulating pilot
valve. As a result, the pressure regulating pilot valve causes
the piston to slide together with the valve disk in accordance
with changes in water pressure of the secondary side of the
pressure regulating valve, varying the degree of opening of the
pressure regulating valve.The primary side of the pressure regulating pilot
valve is connected to the primary side of the pressure
regulating valve and the secondary side of the pressure 
regulating pilot valve is connected to a cylinder of the
pressure regulating valve. Further, the valve disk of the
pressure regulating pilot valve is connected to a shaft which is
urged toward the direction of opening of the valve. This shaft
is connected to a diaphragm in an operation chamber and the
operation chamber is in communication with the secondary side of
the pressure regulating valve.When water pressure of the secondary side of the
pressure regulating valve is increased, the diaphragm in the
operation chamber of the pressure regulating pilot valve is
raised and the shaft is caused to slide toward the valve closing
direction, whereas, when the secondary side water pressure of
the pressure regulating valve is reduced, the diaphragm in the
operation chamber of the pressure regulating pilot valve is
lowered and the shaft is caused to slide toward the valve
opening direction. The water pressure to be supplied to the
cylinder of the pressure regulating valve from the pressure
regulating pilot valve is controlled by means of sliding of the
shaft in this way to regulate the degree of opening of the
pressure regulating valve.In a sprinkler fire extinguishing facility, water
pressure may be abruptly increased for example
