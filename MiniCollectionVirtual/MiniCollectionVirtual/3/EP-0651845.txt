<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a vehicle parking 
installation. Parking installations are known comprising a metal frame 
containing housings for individual automobiles and a member 
for transferring said automobiles from an entry station to 
the individual housings and from these to an exit station, 
which can coincide with or be separate from the entry 
station. Such installations have been proposed based on the most 
varied sizes, configurations and operating principles, and 
have not only solved the problem of the intensive parking of 
a large number of automobiles but have also solved the 
problem of optimizing the capacity of the installation for 
the particular space available. However these known installations have all proved 
unsuitable for small-scale use, ie in the case of a very 
small number of automobiles (generally from two to six), in 
that the various components are not utilized to a 
satisfactory extent and therefore result in an excessive cost 
per housing, ie per parking unit. EP-A2-0437014 relates to a tri-levels parking apparatus 
for vehicles comprising a pair of vertical columns, two 
platforms slidable along the columns, independently  
 
associated for their movimentation along these to cylynder-piston 
units, and provided with locking means along the same 
columns at the the desired level. A feeding and control unit 
is foreseen. The object of the invention is to obviate this drawback 
by providing a vehicle parking installation which solves the 
problem of small-scale use, ie which is convenient for 
individual dwellings or small communities in general, for 
which a traditional automated parking installation would be 
excessively costly. This and further aims are attained according to the 
invention through a vehicle parking installation as described 
in claim 1. Two preferred imbodiments of the present invention are 
described hereinafter with reference to the accompanying 
drawings, in which: 
Figure 1 is a perspective view of a parking installation 
according to the invention in its totally filled 
state;  Figure 2is a side view thereof in its rest configuration; Figure 3shows the same side view as Figure 2, but in its 
partly filled state; Figure 4is an enlarged partial vertical section through a  
 
part of a column with a platform raising cylinder-piston 
unit and a safety cylinder-piston unit; Figure 5shows a different embodiment in the same view as 
Figure 3; and Figure 6shows it in enlarged horizontal section through a 
part of the column. As can be seen from the figures,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A vehicle parking installation, comprising a pair of 
vertical columns (2), a plurality of platforms (8,8') 

provided with carriages (12,12') movable independently of 
each other along said columns (2), and lockable along said 

columns at predetermined distances suitable for accommodating 
individual vehicles (20), means for driving said platforms 

(8,8') along said columns, and a central unit (36) for 
controlling the operating of said installation
 
characterised in that: 


a member (22,38) is applied to each column (2) for driving 
said platform (8,8'), controlled by said central unit (36) 

and provided with means for the releasable connection of 
the member to a selected platform in order to displace said 

selected platform (8,8') along said column, and 
each column (2) is provided with mechanical locking means 
(30,34) spaced at predetermined distances apart, 

individually controlled by said central unit (36) and 
movable between an interference position with the movement 

of the platforms (8,8') and not a interference position. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that each platform (8,8') consists of a pair of runways 

(10,10') provided with sliding carriages (12,12') and joined  
 

together by a connecting cross-member (14,14'). 
An installation as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that that end of each runway (10,10') closer to the columns 

(2) comprises a depression (16). 
An installation as claimed in claim 2 characterised in 
that each runway (10,10') is provided with removable ramps 

(39). 
An installation as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the runways (10,10') are of different length, the runway 

of the upper platform (8) being longer than the runway of the 
lower platform (8'). 
An installation as claimed in claim 2, characterised in 
that the front end of each runway (10,10') is of downwardly 

inclined ramp form. 
An installation as claimed in claim 1, characterised in 
that the member for driving the platforms (8,8') along the 

columns (2) consists of a vertical axis hydraulic cylinder-piston 
unit (22), the rod (24) of which emerges upperly and 

is provided with a deviation pulley (26) for a chain (28) 
which is fixed at one end to said column (2) and at its other 

end to the carriage (12') of the lower platform (8'). 
An installation as claimed in claim 1 characterised in 
that the means for the releasable binding of the platforms  

  
 

(8) to their driving means (22) consists of the support of 

said platform to the lower platform (8') to which said 
driving means (2) is associated. 
An installation according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the driving means of each platform consists of a 

carriage (38), to which the platform (8,8') is individually 
and releasable engageable. 
An installation as claimed in claims 7 and 9 
characterised in that each carriage (38) is fixed to the end 

of the chain (28) not fixed to the relative column (2). 
An installation as claimed in claim 9 characterised in 
that each carriage (38) is provided with a cylindr-piston 

unit (42,44) the rod of which is releasable engageable with a 
corresponding bush provided in each platforms (8,8'). 
An installation as claimed in claim 7, characterised in 
that the end of the rod (32) is mushroom shaped, with its 

front head tapered and having a diameter less than the bore 
diameter of the bush.
