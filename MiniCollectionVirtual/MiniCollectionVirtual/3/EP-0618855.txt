<DESCRIPTION>
 TitleRapid Drying of Polyamide Resins UsingHigh Frequency Electric FieldsTechnical Field This invention relates to an improvement in the drying and moisture control of thermoplastic polyamide resins prior to subsequent processing, such as molding or extrusion. More specifically, this invention relates to a process for quickly removing moisture from thermoplastic polyamide resins by increasing the water diffusion rate within the resin by using high frequency electric fields.Background of the Invention Conventional circulating hot gas dryers, hereinafter conventional dryers, are used to dry various polymers. Some disadvantages of these conventional dryers are (1) long residence times in order to dry the polymers, (2) the use of large vessels to hold the polymer which is being dried, (3) the use of large flows of hot, dry gas, (4) large amounts of energy to run the blower in order to move the gases within the system, and (5) difficulty in controlling moisture of the discharged polymer at the discharge to a fixed moisture level. More specifically, conventional dryers require long residence times for polyamide resins, because the dryers are usually operated at low temperatures in order to minimize yellowing of the polyamide. Thus, because the temperature is low, usually less than 100° C, a longer residence time is required. This residence time can approach several hours. Moreover, because conventional dryers have long residence times, a large vessel is required to hold the polymer. These large vessels are needed because as the polymer is being dried, which requires a significant amount of time, a vessel is needed to contain the polymer while drying occurs. A large facility is required to house the large vessel. Furthermore, conventional dryers usually heat the polymer up to the drying temperature by means of a large volume of heated gas flowing through the polymer. Thus, a large flow of hot, dry gas is needed to flow through the vapor space around the polymer. Consequently, large systems to move the gas within the system, i.e. a blower, are needed, thus, more energyEET 

 is used, approximately 130-150 kW for a 2274 kg/hr dryer, to run the blower to generate this flow.Lastly, conventional dryers, due to their long residence time, are difficult to control in such a way that the discharge moisture is maintained at a fixed value. Specifically, changes made to the dryers during the operation of a process take a long time to materialize due to the amount of time the polymer is in the dryer. For example, if a
