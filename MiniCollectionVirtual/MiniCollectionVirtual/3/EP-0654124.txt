<ABSTRACT>
The efficacy of a multistage ejector pump is considerably improved by flow guiding profiles (1, 2, 3; 4) inserted into the flow channel (17, 17', 17"). The flow guiding profiles consist of one or several adjacent and/or successive profiles which on the one hand reduce the turbulence resulting from the mixture of the substance to be conveyed with the pump fluid and consequent damages to subsequent pump stages, and on the other hand help to reduce the residual energy of the pump fluid. The flow guiding profiles are designed in such a way that they can be used both in so-called flat channel pumps and in radial ejector pumps. The flow guiding profiles can further be assembled with corresponding segments of the ejector pump housing and profiles into ejector pump modules capable of being produced in a single piece and of being assembled with other similar modules into pumps having the desired capacity.

Ejector pumps for sucking up and/or delivering flowable substances or mixtures of
substances with the aid of a fluid motive medium, having a housing (5),


having at least one inlet (15) for the motive medium,
having at least one inlet (16, 16') for the flowable substance or mixture of substances,
having at least one flow conduit (17) which is for the mixing and combined throughflow
of the motive medium and the flowable substance or mixture of substances and has

at least one nozzle (18), at least one mixing zone (19) and at least one diffuser (20),
having at least one suction chamber (7, 7', 8, 8', 9, 9', 10, 10') in a fluid connection on
the one hand with the inlet (16, 16') for the flowable substance or mixture of substances

and on the other hand, via a gap (21, 21') for through passage, with the flow conduit (17),
and
having at least one common outlet (22) for the motive medium and the flowable
substance or mixture of substances,

characterised by

at least one section (1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3') arranged in the flow conduit (17) and having a
surface region with a surface component directed towards the original flow route, which

section (1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3') displaces the fluid flowing towards the section (1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3')
itself and directs it from the original flow route with a lateral direction component, so

that the fluid in the centre comes closer to a flow-conduit wall (17a, 17b) laterally
defining the flow conduit (17).
An ejector pump in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the at least one flow
guiding section is an elongate section (1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3') and its longitudinal extension

extends approximately perpendicular to the extension direction of the flow conduit (17)
and thereby approximately perpendicular to the main flow direction of the fluid in the

flow conduit.
An ejector pump in accordance with Claim 2, characterised in that the sections (1, 1', 2,
2', 3, 3') are symmetrical in cross-section. 
An ejector pump in accordance with Claim 2 or 3, characterised in that the site of the
section (1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3') induced, narrowest cross-section of the flow conduit (17) is

located in the region of the at least one through-passage gap (21; 24) for the flowable
substance or mixture of substances, in particular directly upstream thereof.
An ejector pump in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 4, characterised in that with
sections (1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3') arranged one behind the other in the direction of flow, the

section cross-section increases from section to section in the flow direction.
An ejector pump in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 5, characterised in that at
least one of the sections (1, 1', 2, 2', 3, 3') has a hollow interior and is in a fluid

connection on the one hand with the flow conduit (17) and on the other hand with an
inlet (16) for the flowable substance or mixture of substances.
An ejector pump for sucking up and/or delivering flowable substances or mixtures of
substances with the aid of a fluid motive medium, having a housing (5),


having at least one inlet (15) for the motive medium,
having at least one inlet (16, 16') for the flowable substance or mixture of substances,
having at least one flow conduit (17) which is for the mixing and combined throughflow
of the motive medium and the flowable substance or mixture of substances and has

at least one nozzle (18), at least one mixing zone (19) and at least one diffuser (20),
having at least one suction chamber (7, 7', 8, 8', 9, 9', 10, 10') in a fluid connection on
the one hand with the inlet (16, 16') for the flowable substance or mixture of substances

and on the other hand, via a gap (21, 21') for through passage, with the flow conduit (17),
and
having at least one common outlet (22) for the motive medium and the flowable
substance or mixture of substances

characterised by

at least one elongate dividing wall (4) which is arranged in the flow conduit (17) and
whose longitudinal extension extends approximately parallel to the extension direction of

the flow conduit (17) and thereby approximately parallel to the main flow direction of
the fluid in the flow conduit (17) and divides the cross-section of the flow conduit into

flow partial conduits (17', 17", 17''',...). 
An ejector pump in accordance with Claim 7, characterised in that the dividing wall (4)
becomes narrower in the extension direction of the flow conduit (17).
An ejector pump in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that an
ejector housing comprising a flow conduit (17), an admission chamber (6), at least one

suction chamber (7, 8, 9, 10, 23), a dividing wall (4) and optionally sections (1, 1', 2, 2',
3, 3') is manufactured as an injector pump module.
An ejector pump in accordance with Claim 9, characterised in that the ejector pump
modules are one-piece.
An ejector pump in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that it is
manufactured by joining ejector pump modules.
An ejector pump in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that one
or both lateral surfaces of each dividing wall (4) is provided with sections (1, 1', 2, 2', 3,

3').
