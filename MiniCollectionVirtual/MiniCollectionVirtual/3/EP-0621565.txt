<ABSTRACT>
The centralising system consists of a plurality of autonomous interactive posts (101..., 201, 301, ...), intended to be used by means of an identification support and connected in a network to a central computer (4); each post includes memory means for storing, with each use of the post, an elementary group of data consisting of at least the identity registered in the identification support, the date and time of use of the post. According to the invention, the memory means of each post are read-accessible and possibly write-accessible by the central computer (4); the central computer (4) knows the structure of the memory means and the format of an elementary data group for each type of application, as well as the address and the type of application of each of the posts to which it is connected, and is able to address the memory means of a post which has been selected in such a way as to retrieve, in the memory means, all the elementary data groups which have been stored since the last enquiry. The system of the invention allows the centralising at the level of a single central computer of information identified and time-stamped from posts dedicated to varied applications, such as access control, the clocking-on of staff..., for analysis and management purposes.

System for centralizing heterogeneous information 
related to an identity and collected and time/date logged 

from dispersed terminals, of the type consisting of a 
plurality of standalone interactive terminals (101, ..., 

201, ..., 301, ...), which are intended to be used by 
means of an identification medium (15) and are connected 

in a network to a central computer (4), each terminal 
including storage means (21) and processing means (8, 9, 

11) which on the one hand are able to manage, depending 
on the application to which the terminal is dedicated, 

one or more peripherals (13), including at least means of 
reading (14) the identification medium (15), and which on 

the other hand are able with each use of the terminal, to 
store in the means of storage (21), an elementary data 

group consisting at least of the identity registered in 
the identification medium, the date and time of use of 

the terminal, characterized in that the means of storage 
(21) of each terminal are read-accessible and optionally 

write-accessible by the central computer (4), in that for 
each terminal, the structure of the storage means (21) 

and the format of the elementary data groups are dependent 
solely on the application to which the terminal is 

dedicated, and in that the central computer (4) knows the 
structure of the storage means (21) and the format of an 

elementary data group for each type of application, as 
well as the address and the type of application of each 

of the terminals to which it is connected, and is able to 
address the storage means (21) of a terminal which has 

been selected in such a way as to retrieve, from the 
means of storage (21) of the said terminal, all the  

 
elementary data groups which have been stored since the 

last interrogation of the terminal. 
System according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the means of storage (21) of each terminal contain 

a counter variable which is incremented by the processing 
means (8, 9, 11) with each use of the terminal, which is 

read by the central computer (4), before each operation 
of retrieval of the elementary data groups stored in the 

terminal, and which is reset to zero by the central 
computer (4) once the said operation is completed. 
System according to Claim 2, characterized in 
that the counter variable is used by the processing means 

(8, 9, 11) to calculate the addresses for writing the 
data of each elementary group to the storage means (21). 
System according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that for at least one of the terminals, 

the management of the peripherals by the processing means 
depends on parameters which are stored in the storage 

means (21), and in that the central computer (4) is able 
to modify the value of these parameters. 
System according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that for at least one of the terminals optionally including 

manual input means, the processing means (8, 9, 11) 
are able to authorize or deny the use of the terminal, 

after having compared all or some of the information 
registered in the identification medium (15) and/or 

optionally all or some of the data input, with one or 
more particular parameters termed authorization parameters. 
System according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that an expiry date is registered in the identification 

medium, and in that the processing means of at least one 
terminal are able to authorize or deny the use of the 

terminal, after having compared the said expiry date with 
the date of use of the terminal. 
System according to Claim 4, characterized in 
that a secret code is registered in the identification 

medium, and in that for at least one of the terminals 
which includes manual input means (19), the processing  

 
means are able to authorize or deny the use of the 

terminal, after having compared the said secret code with 
the code entered with the aid of the manual input means. 
System according to Claims 5, 6 and 7, characterized 
in that the storage means (21) of at least one 

terminal (101) dedicated to access control contain at 
least one parameter termed the restriction level, and in 

that the ability of the processing means to authorize or 
deny the use of the terminal (101), is dependent on the 

value of this parameter. 
system according to Claim 8, characterized in 
that the storage means (21) of those terminals (101) 

dedicated to access control contain several restriction 
level parameters each associated with a time slot and 

optionally with a day of the week, and in that the 
processing means (8, 9, 11) are able to retrieve the 

restriction level parameter corresponding to the time 
slot and optionally to the date of use of the terminal.
