<ABSTRACT>
Process for obtaining an internal combustion engine fuel from a hydrocarbon feedstock, including a stage a) of distillation (D1) in which a tail product (Q1) is obtained via a line 3 and a head product (T1) via a line 2, a stage b) of liquid/liquid extraction (LE) with the aid of a solvent (S1) in which an extract (E1) (line 6) and a raffinate (R1), (line 5) are obtained from the product (Q1), a stage c) of separation (D2) of the raffinate (R1) making it possible to obtain via a line 7 a product (Q2) impoverished in solvent (S1) and a stage d) of hydrotreatment (HDS) in which the mixture of the products (T1) and (Q2) is treated in hydrotreatment conditions under a partial hydrogen pressure lower than 10 megapascals and a product (P), is obtained (line 9) which has improved qualities and contains less than 500 ppm by weight of sulphur. According to a particular embodiment the extract (E1) (line 6) is distilled so as to obtain via a line 11 a tail product (Q3) which is subsequently sent to a hydrotreatment zone so as to obtain via a line 12 a product (P') containing less than 0.3% by weight of sulphur. The solvent (S1) recovered at the head of the distillations is recycled to the extraction stage b).

A process for obtaining a pretroleum product which can be used as a
base in the composition of a fuel for an internal combustion engine with compressiion

ignition, having an improved cetane index and an improved sulphur content, from a
hydrocarbon charge which has an initial boiling point of at least 150°C and a final

boiling point of a maximum of 500°C, containing 0.05 % to 5 % by weight of sulphur,
10 to 60 % weight of n- and iso-alkanes, 10 % to 90 % by weight of aromatic

hydrocarbons at least partly in the form of sulphured or unsulphured polyaromatic
compounds, having a cetane index of 20 to 60 and having a nitrogen content of 50 to

5 000 ppm by weight, said process being characterized in that it comprises the
following steps :


a step (a) for distillation in which at the bottom a product (Q1) is separated
which contains the majority of the polyaromatic compounds and a product (T1), at the

top,
a step (b) for liquid/liquid extraction in which the bottom product (Q1) obtained
in step a) is contacted at a maximum temperature of 140° C, under conditions for the

extraction of polyaromatic compounds, with a solvent or a mixture of solvents (S1)
which enable at least part of the polyaromatic compounds which it contains to be

extracted, said solvent having an initial boiling point which is at least 20° C less than
the initial boiling poiint of the bottom product (Q1) obtained in step (a), and during

which an extract (E1) which has a high content of polyaromatic compounds and a
raffinate (R1) are recovered.
a step c) for separating the raffinate (R1) obtained in step (b) in which at the
top a product is separated which has a high content of a solvent (S1) of a product

(Q2) which has a low content of solvent (S1).
A hydrotreatment step (d) in which at least part of the top product (T1)
obtained in step a) and at least part of the product (Q2) obtained in step c) are

introduced into a hydrotreatment reactor, and the mixture obtained is then subjected
to hydrotreatment at partial hydrogen pressure of less than about 10 megapascals, 

and a product (P) is recovered which has a cetane index greater by at least 2 points
than that of the charge and containing less than 500 ppm by weight of sulphur.
A process according to Claim 1 in which a top product having a final
boiling point less than 360° C and preferably less than 330° C, is separated in step

(a).
A process according to Claim 1 or Claim 2 in which step (b) is carried
out with a solvant (S1) volume to a bottom product Q1 volume ratio of 0.2 : 1 to 5 : 1

90 %, and preferably a maximum of 70 % by weight, of the total weight of aromatic

compounds, not containing any sulphur atoms in their molecule, present in the
product (Q1) obtained in step a).
A process according to one of Claims 1 to 3 in which said extract (E1)
obtained in step b) is conveyed to a separation zone in order to recover a product

which has a high content of solvent (S1) and a product (Q3) which has a low content
of solvent (S1).
