<ABSTRACT>
A reticulated ceramic particle (18) is 
provided having from 5 to 95 percent, 

preferably from about 10 to about 90, percent of the total porosity attributable to 
mesopores. Reticulated ceramic particles (18) 

provided include silicon oxide, aluminum 
oxide, zirconium oxide and ruthenium oxide. 

Reticulated ceramic particles (18) are 
prepared using a porous solid matrix (2) 

as a template. The reticulated ceramic particles 
are useful as chromatographic media, catalysts and adsorbents.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to a method for preparing reticulated ceramic
particles. In particular, the present invention is directed to a method for preparing
reticulated ceramic particles of controlled porosity and pore size distribution.The term "reticulated" relates to the network-like pore structure of the ceramic
particles prepared according to the present invention. The porosity of the ceramic
particles prepared according to the present invention is a result of micropores,
mesopores and macropores. As defined by Gregg, et al., in Adsorption, Surface Area
and Porosity, "micropores" are pores having diameters of less than about 20 angstroms
(Å), "mesopores" are pores having diameters of from about 20 Å to about 500Å, and
"macropores" are pores having diameters of greater than about 500Å.The porous ceramic materials previously known achieve their porosity
predominantly from macropores, micropores or both. Several methods for
introducing macroporosity into ceramic materials are known. One method involves
incorporating volatile organic solvents or other combustible media throughout a sol of
a ceramic precursor. The sol is then allowed to gel. The resulting gel is then heated to
an elevated temperature sufficient to form the ceramic material and volatilize the
entrained organic material. The voids remaining in the ceramic formed by the extant
organic material are predominantly macropores. One common method for
introducing micropores is precipitation of the ceramic material from solution.Another method for attempting to prepare ceramic materials with porosity, as
disclosed in UK-A-2,170,189 involves the preparation of microspheres of ceramic
materials by hydrolyzing an organic ceramic precursor in the presence of a protective
colloid. The voids, or pores, remaining in the ceramic formed by this process are
predominantly macropores.GB-A-1,598, 369 discloses a method for the preparation of catalysts comprising
Group VIB and/or VIII metals on an alumina support, the method comprising forming
an alumina hydrogel, contacting the hydrogel with a water-soluble polymer
containing monomer units selected from polyethylene glycols, polypropylene glycols
and polyethylene amines to form a polymer-containing hydrogel. A suspension of the
polymer-containing hydrogel is spray-dried to form polymer-containing boehmite
granules which are mixed with water to form a paste. The paste is then homogenised
and extruded to form shapes. The resulting extrudate is then extracted with a solvent
to remove the polymer, dried
