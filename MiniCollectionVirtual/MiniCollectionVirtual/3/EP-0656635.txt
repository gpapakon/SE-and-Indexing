<ABSTRACT>
The device for measuring pulse energy includes integration means and provides a measure of high-intensity disturbances flowing on a cable.   It is characterised in that it further includes a current-voltage converter (2) mounted on the cable (1), attenuation means (3, 4) coupling the said converter to the integration means (5, 6) and a logic processing and memory-storage assembly (12) coupled to the integration means and to an output display (20). Application: monitoring of lightning protection equipment.

Device for measuring pulse energy, designed to
measure the energy of high-intensity disturbances

flowing along a cable, comprising:

a current/voltage converter (2) delivering a voltage
proportional to the intensity of the current in the

said cable,
an analogue measurement branch (3, 5, 7, 9), linked
to the said current/voltage converter and
a processing and storage assembly (12), coupled to
the said measurement branch and to an output display,

characterized in that it comprises at least two
measurement branches, each comprising an input

attenuator (3, 4) and an output integrator (5, 6) which
is coupled to the said input attenuator, in which

branches the attenuators thereof have different
attenuations and are linked in parallel to the said

current/voltage converter (2).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the said converter (2) exhibits a current/voltage

conversion ratio of less than 1.
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the said converter (2) is a current probe, mounted

around the said cable (1) and exhibiting a conversion
ratio of the order of 1/10.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 3,
characterized in that it furthermore comprises a peak-limiting

circuit (23) associated with each attenuator
(3, 4), with the possible exception of that having the 

highest attenuation, limiting the output voltage level
of the relevant attenuator, for protection of this

integrator and of the processing and storage assembly.
Device according to one of Claims 1 to 4,
characterized in that it furthermore comprises, on each

measurement branch, peak value detection means (9, 10),
linked in parallel with the said integrator (5, 6) of

this measurement branch to the input attenuator (3, 4)
of the measurement branch, and coupled to the said

processing and storage assembly (12).
