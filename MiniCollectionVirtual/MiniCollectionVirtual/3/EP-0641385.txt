<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a general method for identifying genes and producing immunological reagents which encode cell surface antigens of human origin. Specifically, the present invention provides a method for preparing a hybridoma cell line which produces an antibody which specifically recognizes and binds to a cell surface antigen associated with a neoplastic, human cell. This invention also provides a method for preparing a monoclonal and a polyclonal antibody which specifically recognizes and binds to a cell surface antigen associated with a neoplastic, human cell. Using the antibodies produced, this invention further provides a method for diagnosing in a subject a neoplastic condition, a method for treating a neoplastic condition, and a method for imaging a neoplastic, human cell. This invention also provides a method for preparing DNA encoding a cell surface antigen associated with a neoplastic, human cell, DNA probes hybridized with the DNA prepared therein, as well as a method for diagnosing a neoplastic condition using the DNA probes.

<DESCRIPTION>
Throughout this application, various publications are
referenced by Arabic numerals within parentheses. Full
citations for these publications may be found at the end of
the specification immediately preceding the claims.Studies over the past several years have been based on
several hypotheses. (1) Human cancer develops as a
consequence of heritable alterations in a cells genotype.
These heritable alterations may involve direct changes in
the structure and/or expression of specific genes which
regulate expression of the transformed state. Genotypic
markers and potential inducers of the tumor cell phenotype
include the activation of specific oncogenic elements and/or
the loss or inactivation of tumor suppressor elements (1,2).
(2) The neoplastic phenotype is often characterized by the
surface expression of novel tumor associated antigen (TAA)
subsets which are specific for different histological types
of tumors and which may be differentially expressed in
patients with the same tumor histotype. By employing
specific cytokines, the level of expression of specific TAAs
can be increased resulting in the improved diagnosis,
imaging and ultimately enhanced monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 
based therapy of cancer (3-5). (3) the specific TAA subset
expressed in a particular tumor may not be recognized by the
patients' own immune system, thereby resulting in the
inability of the patient to mount an effective immunological
response and destroy the neoplastic lesion. This problem
can be overcome by the exogenous application of MoAbs
(specifically human MoAbs; primate MoAbs or chimerized
murine MoAbs), augmenting the patients' immune potential
with cytokines and expression vector-based
immunopotentiators and/or modifying a patients' own tumor
cells to function as a vaccine. (4) In many cases, the
genetic elements(s) which induces the tumorigenic phenotype
may also encode for the specific cell surface TAA. It
should, therefore, be possible to cotransfer both the
tumorigenic phenotype and its corresponding TAA subset to
suitable recipient cells by DNA-transfer techniques.Transformation of NIH3T3 cells with DNA from pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cells (HPAF cell line) has been described Antibodies
specific for pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell surface antigens
have been produced using said transformed NIH3T3
cells (97).Studies to directly test many of the above hypotheses have
been conducted over the past several years and a number of
assumptions have now been validated. One initial test case
has involved studies on the genetic
