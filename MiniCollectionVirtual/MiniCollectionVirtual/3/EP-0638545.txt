<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is concerned with a process for preparing a 1, 2-diacyl-2-tertiary
alkylhydrazide. More particularly, the present invention is concerned
with a process for preparing the aforesaid hydrazide wherein, in a first step, an
aromatic acid anhydride is reacted with a defined hydrazine so that the resultant
intermediate is obtained in the substantial absence of undesirable isomers. In a
second step, the resultant mono acyl hydrazide is reacted with an aromatic acid
chloride to obtain the final product. These hydrazides are known to have
insecticidal activity against Coleoptera and Lepidoptera.It is known to prepare a 1, 2-diacyl-2-t-alkylhydrazide by reacting an aromatic
benzoyl chloride with a tertiary alkyl hydrazine to yield a mono acyl hydrazide.
Thereafter, the hydrazide may be reacted with a second aromatic acid chloride to
yield the desired diacyl hydrazide.When the aromatic acid chloride is reacted with the t-alkyl hydrazine to yield
the intermediate hydrazide, the reaction results in two possible mono acylated
products and one diacylated impurity. The desired intermediate product, however,
is an acyl-2-alkylhydrazide. The mono acylated side product reacts in the second
step of the process to form a new impurity, and the original diacylated impurity is
carried through the process unchanged. Both side products provide contaminants of
the final desired product. It therefore becomes necessary to remove the undesired
side products in order to obtain a substantially pure 1, 2-diacyl-2-t-alkylhydrazide."1-Acetyl-1-alkyl- and 1-acetyl-2-alkylhydrazines", S.S.Kirov Military-Medical
