<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the separation of solids from
the liquid in which they are suspended.Suspended solid particles in a liquid such as water
will float or sink at a velocity which is a function of
the size of the particles, the specific gravity
difference between the solids and the liquid and the
viscosity of the liquid. The smaller the particles,
the lower is the settling velocity, which effectively
becomes zero for small "colloidal" particles. If
the particles settle rapidly they can be separated from
a liquid stream more readily.The settling velocity can be increased by collecting
the particles into "flocs' which are agglomerations of
the particles, where the flocs act as one composite
particle and settle more rapidly than the particles
making up the flocs would settle. The creation of
flocs is usually promoted by adding chemicals to the
liquid, either coagulants or flocculants, which act
upon the electrical charges on the particles. The
flocs grow by collision between particles in the fluid
as it is agitated or mixed and the particles are held
together after colliding by forces of electrical
attraction. For flocs to grow and settle rapidly the fluid mixing
is such that the particles collide in the velocity
gradients created by the mixing.This invention is concerned with the manner of mixing
liquid having suspended particles with flocculating
agents to promote the accelerated growth of flocs. It
is known to promote flocculation using stirrer type
apparatus. With the method and apparatus provided by
this invention uniform sized flocs can be formed in a
controlled manner, this is not possible with
conventional stirred apparatus.A practical use for the method of the invention would
be for the treatment of water. For example, water
from reservoirs where contaminants have mixed with the
water, such water being for use as drinking water or
for commercial purposes. Another example would be for
the treatment of water which has been contaminated by
use, such as industrial processes or in a sewerage
system. Attempts have been made to promote flocculation in contaminated
liquids in order to separate out contaminating solids. One prior art patent in
this field is U.S. 5124049 which discloses a method of promoting the
formation of flocs comprising the steps of passing a liquid having suspended
particles and an added flocculant as a vortex flow through a tapered conduit
where the conduit is circular in cross-section and increases in cross-sectional
size in the direction of liquid flow through the

<CLAIMS>
A method of promoting the formation of flocs comprising the steps
of mixing a liquid having suspended particles with gas under pressure

and expanding the gas/liquid mixture to a lower pressure and then
causing the mixture to pass as a vortex flow through a tapered conduit

where the conduit is circular in cross-section and increases in cross -
sectional size in the direction of flow through the conduit,

wherein the taper of the conduit is not such that the flow will leave the conduit wall.
A method as claimed in claim 1 including the additional step of
mixing a flocculent with said liquid.
Apparatus for carrying out the method of claim 1
including means to mix a liquid having suspended particles with gas

under pressure, means for expanding the gas/liquid mixture by reducing
its pressure, and means for passing the reduced pressure mixture as a

vortex flow through a tapered conduit from a small end of the conduit to
a large end of the conduit,

wherein the taper of the conduit is not such that the flow will leave the conduit wall.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 where the conduit has a constant
angle of taper between the conduit small and large ends.
Apparatus as claimed in claim 3 where the angle of taper of the
conduit is not constant.
Apparatus is claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5 where the means
for passing the mixture through the conduit as a vortex flow includes a

tangential inlet through a wall of the conduit adjacent said small end of
said conduit.
Apparatus as claimed in any one of claims 3 to 5 where the means
for passing the mixture through the conduit as a vortex flow includes a 

tangentially discharging discharge head disposed within the conduit
adjacent said small end of the conduit.
