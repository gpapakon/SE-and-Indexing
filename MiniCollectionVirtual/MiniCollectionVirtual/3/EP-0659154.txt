<CLAIMS>
A gastronomy-standard container with a closure lid 
and intended to hold perishable goods, the lid (1) being of 

flexurally resistant construction to allow emptying and 
being provided with a vacuum valve (4), a gasket (2) 

disposed between lid (1) and container (3) and a rim (10) 
which matches the rim of the container (3), characterised in 

that the rim (10) of the lid (1) is stepped to match the rim 
of the container (3), is constructed to provide a covering 

area (11) and comprises a bracing surface (12) bearing on 
the lateral walls (15) of the container (3), so that after a 

relatively short deformation path, during emptying, the 
lateral walls (15) of the container (3) abut the bracing 

surface (12) of the lid (1) and in that the gasket is fitted 
on the covering area (11) of the lid (1).

to claim 1, characterised in that the lid (1) is provided 

with a valve (4) disposed at the rim. 
A gastronomy-standard container with lid according 
to claim 1, characterised in that the gasket (2) is 

separably mounted on the covering area (11). 
A gastronomy-standard container with lid according 
to claim 3, characterized in that the valve (4) and lid (1) 

have matching screw threads and in that a gasket (5) is 
disposed between both parts (4, 1).  

 
A gastronomy-standard container with lid according 
to claim 1, characterised in that the rim (10) comprises a 

grooved rim (13) which forms the bracing area (12). 
A gastronomy-standard container with lid according 
to claim 1, characterised in that the lid (1) consists of 

metal.
