<ABSTRACT>
A system memory (34) in the electronic device has a 
display data memory area (35), and when a CPU (31) 

accesses directly to the system memory (34), the liquid 
crystal display control section (LCDC) (36) monitors 

whether or not address data is directed to the display 
data memory area (35). In the case where the address 

data is directed to the display memory area (35), the 
LCDC (36) transfers display data and address data to the 

display driving circuit (38a, 38b). The display driving 
circuit (38a or 38b) comprises a VRAM (40a or 40b), in 

which the display data is stored in a predetermined memory 
location in accordance with the received address 

data, and the stored data is displayed on the LCD (32).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a control device
for writing display data in a memory, which is used, for
example, in an electronic device having a liquid crystal
display section.FIG. 5 is a diagram showing the structure of a conventional
display control device having a display video
memory (VRAM) in a system memory. The system memory 13
is connected to a central processing unit (CPU) 11 via
data and address bus 12, and also segment display drivers
(D/DSEG) 15a and 15b of a dot matrix liquid crystal
display 14 are connected to the CPU 11.The CPU 11 includes a liquid crystal display
control section 11a, control signals from which are
supplied to the system memory 13, D/DSEG 15a and 15b, as
well as to a common display driver (D/DCOM).In the conventional display control device shown in
FIG. 5, the VRAM 13a is provided in the system memory
13, and the VRAM 13a in the system memory 13 is directly
accessed by the CPU 11 for writing/reading of data to be
displayed. Therefore, the software burden can be
reduced. However, while data being displayed on the LCD
14, the display data in the VRAM 13a must be transferred
at all times to the D/DSEG 15a and 15b, and therefore
when the number of display pixels is increased, the data
transfer amount, that is, the number of times of data
access to the VRAM 13a, is accordingly increased, 
resulting in consuming a great amount of current.FIG. 6 is a diagram showing the structure of
another conventional display control device comprising a
display video memory (VRAM) in a display driver chip.
As shown in the figure, a system memory 23, a liquid
crystal display section 24, and segment display drivers
(D/DSEG) 25a and 25b are connected to a CPU 21 via data
and address bus 22.Display data and a write control signal for VRAMs
26a and 26b respectively provided in the D/DSEG 25a and
25b are supplied to the D/DSEG 25a and 25b from the CPU
21, and a display timing signal from a liquid crystal
display control section (LCDC) 27 provided in the
D/DSEG 25a is supplied to the D/DSEG 25b and a D/DCOM
(common display driver) 28.More specifically, in the conventional display
control device shown in FIG. 6, while data being displayed
on the LCD 24, a segment of the LCD 24 is driven
directly by the bit pattern data written in the VRAMs
26a and 26b in the D/DSEG 25a and 25b, and therefore
even if there are a great number of display pixels, the
number of times of data access with respect to the CPU
21 can be kept small. Further, since a multi-bit output
memory can be used as a memory for
