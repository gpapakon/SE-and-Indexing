<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a solution of a substantially 
fully-imidized polyimidesiloxane in a substituted pyrrolidone 
solvent and to a method of coating substrates. In particular, 
it relates to solutions of polyimidesiloxanes in solvents 
containing N-cyclohexyl pyrrolidone (CHP), which do not 
develop a white crust when the solution is applied. A coating of a polymer can be made by dissolving the 
polymer in a solvent, spreading the solution over a substrate, 
and evaporating the solvent. When solutions of certain 
polymers in some solvents are spread and the solvent is 
evaporated, an objectionable white crust is formed. The 
whitening of the coating is a problem because it affects the 
flow characteristics of the solution in such a way that it 
sometimes does not uniformly coat the substrate. For example, solutions of polyamic acids or polyimides in 
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) can develop this problem. The 
problem has been overcome for particular polyamic acids or 
polyimides by mixing the NMP with various co-solvents such as 
cyclohexanone (EP Application 364791 A2), tetramethylbenzene 
(EP Application 363737 A2), and butyl cellosolve acetate 
(Japanese Application 83-76689). While those solutions to the 
problem may be adequate for the particular polyimide being 
coated, they are not adequate for polyimidesiloxanes, because  
 
polyimidesiloxanes are less soluble than polyamic acids and 
may not dissolve in those mixtures of solvents. Also, 
whitening could still occur and there may be other reasons for 
not using those particular solvents. Until now a general 
solvent system for polyimidesiloxanes that does not produce 
whitening when a coating is formed has not been found. It has now been discovered that if polyimidesiloxanes are 
dissolved in certain particular derivatives of pyrrolidone, 
coatings formed from the solution do not undergo whitening. 
The solvent system of this invention can be evaporated at 
temperatures low enough to prevent damage to most substrates. 
Also, although substantially fully imidized polyimidesiloxanes 
are insoluble in many solvents, they are nevertheless soluble 
in the solvent system of this invention. Another advantage of the solvents used in this invention 
is that a large variety of polyimidesiloxanes are soluble in 
them that are not soluble in other solvents. Also, we have 
found that if a solution of a polyimidesiloxane in some 
solvents is permitted to stand for a long period of time the 
polyimidesiloxane may gel or precipitate. However, that
