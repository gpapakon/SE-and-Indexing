<ABSTRACT>
A ferritic stainless steel exhibiting excellent atmospheric 
corrosion resistance and crevice corrosion resistance can be 

provided by positively adding P thereto and by adequately 
adjusting Ca and Al. The ferritic stainless steel according to 

the present invention essentially consists of, in weight 
percentages,

 
   C : about 0.05 % or less Si : about 1.0 % or less

 
   Cr : about 11 % or more and less than about 20 %

 
   Mn : about 1.0 % or less N : about 0.10 % or less

 
   S : about 0.03 % or less

 
   Ca : about 5 ppm or more and about 50 ppm or less

 
   Al : about 0.5 % or less

 
   P : more than about 0.04 % and about 0.20 % or less 

and the balance being iron and incidental impurities. The 
stainless steel according to the present invention may also 

contain at least one element selected from a group (1) consisting 
of about 6% or less of Mo, group (2) consisting of about 1.0 % or 

less of Cu, about 3% or less of Ni and about 3 % or less of Co, 
or group (3) consisting of about 1.0 % or less of Ti, about 1.0 % 

or less of Nb, about 1.0 % or less of V, about 1.0 % or less of 
W, about 1.0 % or less of Zr, about 1.0 % or less of Ta and about 

0.05 % or less of B.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a ferritic stainless steel 
which when worked exhibits excellent atmospheric corrosion 
resistance and crevice corrosion resistance. Ferritic stainless 
steel according to the present invention is suitable to be worked 
and used as building exterior finish work, electric appliance 
parts, panels or a hot water tank bodies. Known kinds of 
materials heretofore were not usable for a long period of time 
without extensive maintenance, and required treatments for 
atmospheric corrosion resistance and crevice corrosion 
resistance. US-A-4,824,635 relates to a ferritic stainless steel 
consisting essentially of, in % by weight 0.0050 to 0.0500 of 
C, 10.00 to 18.00 of Cr, up to 0.50 of Si, up to 0.50 of Mn, 
more than 0.040 but not more than 0.200 of P, up to 0.030 of S, 
up to 0.60 of Ni, 0.005 to 0.200 of Sol. Al, and 0.0020 to 
0.0050 of B, the balance being Fe and impurities, and having a 
longitudinal cracking transition temperature of not higher than 
-10°C. EP-A-0130220 relates to a corrosion-resistant alloy 
comprising, by weight , 0.05% or less C, 10.00 to 18.00% Cr, 
1.00% or less Si, 1.00% or less Mn, more than 0.040% and not 
more than 0.15% P, 0.050% or less S, 0.60% or less Ni, 0.005 to 
0.50% sol. Al, and the balance of Fe and unavoidable 
impurities. It is an object of this citation to obviate a 
special treatment for the removal of P in operating converter 
by adding more than 0.040% but not more than 0.150% of P and 
thereby to improve workability and pickling performance of an 
alloy, without adversely affecting corrosion resistance.  
 US-A-4,465,525 relates to a ferritic steel having 
excellent formability, for example, in a deep drawing 
procedure, contains 0.04 to 0.1 weight % of C, 1.0 weight % or 
less of Si, 0.75 weight % or less of Mn, 10 to 30 weight % of 
Cr, 0.5 weight % or less of Ni, 0.025 weight % or less of N, 2 
to 30 ppm of boron, and optionally, 0.005 to 0.4 weight % of an 
additional alloy component consisting of Al and, further 
optionally, a further additional alloy component consisting of 
at least one member selected from 0.005 to 0.6 weight % of Ti, 
0.005 to 0.4 weight % of Nb, V, and Zr, 0.02 to 0.50 weight % 
of Cu, and 0.05 weight % or less of Ca and Ce, the sum of the 
contents of C and N being 0.0502 weight % or more. Another prior art document, EP-A-0050456 discloses a 
ferritic stainless steel having enhanced formability and anti-ridging 
property. Those properties are obtained by using an 
aluminum content being at least
