<ABSTRACT>
A retail checkout system (10) allows a customer to gather and pay for 
items without going through a checkout lane. The system includes a wireless 

checkout device (11) transported by a customer, preferably on a shopping cart, 
which the customer uses to identify and pay for items associated with a shopping 

transaction. The checkout device (11) includes a wireless communication device 
(24), a scanner (18), and a marking/unmarking device (20). The 

marking/unmarking device (20) is operative to deactivate security devices on the 
items when the items are scanned a first time by the customer and to reactivate 

the security devices when the items are scanned a second time by the customer. 
The system also includes a central com
puter (26) and a wireless communication 
network linking the checkout device (11) with the computer (26). A security 

system located at an exit and coupled to the computer (26) senses items which 
have not been deactivated by the marking/unmarking device (20) and alerts the 

computer (26) and security personnel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to retail stores and equipment, and more 
specifically to a retail checkout system and shopping method. Retail stores typically require customers to funnel through checkout lanes, 
one person at a time, to pay for the goods and services. This results in the 
problem that, when a store has an insufficient number of checkout stations or 
people to man them during any given level of customer activity, customers must 
line up and wait to complete the sale that results in a transfer of assets. Retail stores employing unattended checkout lanes experience a similar 
problem. During peak periods of customer demand, customers must line up at a 
machine that requires tender of payment before access to merchandise or 
services is allowed. In either case, the lines become bottlenecks which inconvenience 
customers, possibly to the point of customers leaving to shop elsewhere. Other 
lost sales are from customers who simply avoid the retail location at known busy 
times and shop elsewhere, because of past inconvenience from delays. It is an object of the present invention to provide a retail system for the 
sale of goods or services which alleviates the problems referred to above. According to the invention there is provided a checkout system 
characterized by a checkout device transportable by a customer and adapted to 
be used by the customer to identify and pay for items associated with a shopping 
transaction, said checkout device including a wireless communication device; 
and a central computer linked by a communication network with said checkout 
device. Preferably, a checkout system in accordance with the invention includes a 
security system arranged to sense items which have not been identified and 
purchased. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, said security system 
includes scanning means for scanning items, and a marking/unmarking device 
operative to deactivate security devices on the items when the items are scanned 
a first time by said scanning means, and operative to reactivate the security 
devices when the items are scanned a second time by said scanning means.  One embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of 
example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: 
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a retail checkout system in accordance with 
the present invention; and Fig. 2 is a perspective view of a shopping cart or trolley having customer-operated 
components of the system of Fig. 1. Referring now to Figs. 1 and 2, system 10
