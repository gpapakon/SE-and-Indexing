Process for the automatic pressing and piling of hose, comprising the phases 
of mounting individually and in continuous succession the articles of hose to be pressed onto 

corresponding supports (10) distributed over a circumference with a horizontal shaft (12), 
inspecting that side of the hose which is visible to the operator, dry-pressing r steam-pressing 

the articles of hose individually, and causing the said supports (10) of the hose to rotate about 
a horizontal shaft (13) in order to inspect that side of the hose which is opposite to that 

visible in the "mounting" position, characterised in that it comprises the following phases: 

in the position occupied by the supports on the completion of the inspection 
of the hose, indicating the position of any faulty articles of hose; 
after the hose has been pressed the said supporting means are turned by a 
further step and the article of hose thus inspected is dry-pressed or steampressed; 
the said supporting means are turned by one or more further steps together 
with the hose, the support corresponding to the articles of hose thus pressed 

and free of flaws being then removed from the support by a horizontal 
movement acting on that zone of the hose which corresponds to the foot (14), 

after which 
the article of hose thus removed is then extracted in order to be subsequently 
piled, while finally, 
a pre-selected number of articles of hose thus extracted are piled in order to 
enable them to be subsequently conditioned in single or multiple pairs. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the said dry 
pressing is effected by heating the hose on the respective supports themselves. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the said steam 
pressing is effected in two phases, following the said inspection phase (b), comprising, in the 

order stated, hot steam dampening and pressing of the hose, pressing and drying of the hose 
by extraction of the steam. 
Process in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the said drying 
phase of the hose is prolonged until its extraction from the corresponding supporting means.  

 
Machine for the automatic pressing and piling of hose, comprising a circular 
plate (1) with a horizontal central shaft (12), an electric motor for moving the said plate (1), 

with transmission coupled to the said shaft (12), a steaming and pressing chamber (4) for the 
hose, a number of flat support forms (10) fore the hose to be pressed, distributed at equal 

distance over a periphery of the said plate, characterised in that the flat support forms (109) 
are positioned perpendicularly to the plate and on the same fact of the latter and substantially 

in a direction tangent thereto, each of the said plates (10) being equipped with a horizontal 
rotation shaft (13), the machine comprising in addition: 


a cam (3) with a curvilinear profile positioned on that side of the forms (10) 
which is opposite to the plate (1), in order to control the rotation of each 

form (10) around the respective shaft (13) in accordance with the hose 
mounting station, between a position substantially tangent to the said plate 

and a radial position and vice versa, interacting with a corresponding feeler 
(15) with a drawback spring, which in connected to the base of each form 

(10); 
a pressing and drying chamber for the hose, positioned immediately 
"downstream" from the said steaming chamber (4); 
a clamp (6) for extracting the article of hose thus pressed, positioned with the 
leg and the foot horizontal, acting in the zone of the foot (14) on both sides 

of the article of hose, which moves away from the corresponding form (10) 
in a resulting rectilinear course on the prolongation of the axis of the foot 

(14), until it releases it onto a horizontal belt conveyor (7) which is situated 
underneath and at one end of which a receptacle (8) is provided for the 

collection of rejects, i.e. of defective articles of hose; 
a number of suction mouthpieces (9) supported by a horizontal arm (90) for 
selecting and vertically raising the article of hose thus extracted and free of
