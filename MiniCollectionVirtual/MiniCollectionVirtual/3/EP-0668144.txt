<ABSTRACT>
The present invention is a polyester film base which has a surface 
approximately 5 nm thick. The surface of the film base has been altered to include 

about 6 to 15 atomic percent nitrogen in the form of imines, secondary amines and 
primary amines in the ratio of about 1:1:2. The invention also includes a film base 

whose surface includes oxygen in the form of hydroxyl, ether, epoxy, carbonyl or 
carboxyl groups wherein the oxygen is about 4 to 10 atomic percent above the original 

surface content of the base. The polyester film base can be either polyethylene 
terephthalate or polyethylene naphthalate.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of photosensitive
materials. More specifically, the present invention is a polyester material having the
proper surface characteristics to promote adhesion of photosensitive coating materials.Corona discharge treatment (CDT), which produces a gaseous
discharge at atmospheric pressure, is widely used to promote the adhesion of
photographic layers to the supporting base material or to one another. Examples of the
use of corona discharge treatment are found in U.S. Patents 4,394,442; 4,229,523;
4,363,872; 4,292,032; 4,663,263; 4,009,037; 4,087,574; 4,055,685; 5,004,669;
3,874,877; 3,860,427; 3,630,742; 3,607,345; 3,531,314 and 3,411,908. Corona
discharges, however, are relatively uncontrolled. Most often, they take place in an
ambient environment, so that differences in relative humidity and temperature can lead
to non-reproducible results. Another characteristic of corona discharge treatments at
atmospheric pressure is the presence of streamers, or intense localized discharges. We
have found, by using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), that surfaces of CDT
treated polymers have large spatial variations in the degree of treatment. It is theorized
that the variability of the surfaces is due to the presence of streamers.To avoid these problems, the use of glow discharge treatments (GDT),
which take place at reduced pressures, has been suggested. A GDT discharge is much
more diffuse than a CDT discharge and the treatment is uniform and reproducible.
This makes it a better process than CDT for many applications. Glow discharges are a
well-known method of promoting adhesion in a wide variety of systems. For example,
U.S. Patent 3,288,638 describes the GDT treatment of polymers in an inert gas
environment to promote adhesion of metals. The desirable results of adhesion are
attributed to the bombardment of the surfaces by inert gas ions and electrons.U.S. Patent 3,837,886 describes the use of GDT to promote the
adhesion of a gelatine containing binder to biaxially drawn, surface roughened
polystyrene. Tatsuta and Ueno, the inventors of U.S. Patent 3,837,886, find that GDT
is ineffective without first roughening the polystyrene surface. They also report that
the choice of treatment gas is unimportant. Dolezalek, et al (U.S. Patent 4,451,497), discuss the treatment of
various polyester supports to promote the adhesion of photographic emulsions
directly onto the support. They attribute the beneficial effects to a reduction in
surface charge and report no
