<ABSTRACT>
A tubular member having integral exterior protrusions is manufactured by providing a hollow element, for example by extrusion, having therein an axially extending interior defined by a surrounding wall having a thickness varying circumferentially. Such hollow element is positioned within a die that has therein lateral voids. The hollow element within the die is subjected, at the interior thereof, to an axially sequential deformation, for example by sequential penetration through the interior by a mandrel. This results in a non-elastic flow of the material of a thicker portion of the wall in lateral directions thereof into the voids in the die. This results in the hollow element being formed into a tubular member having on the exterior thereof solid protrusions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing a tubular member having integral
exterior protrusions. The present invention also and more particularly relates to such a method
of manufacturing a fluid conduit such as an integrated or integral manifold, for example for use
in a heat exchanger, comprising a hollow body having on the exterior thereof a plurality of
integral, longitudinally spaced hollow risers.Integral manifolds, for example for heat exchangers, presently are manufactured by a number
of processes. One such known process provides that hollow risers are provided by conducting
a deep drawing operation on a sheet of suitable material, for example aluminium sheet
material, after which the sheet is bent into the form of a tube and abutting ends of the sheet
are welded together. Thus is formed a tube having extending therefrom hollow risers. An
obvious disadvantage of this construction is the resultant longitudinally extending welded seam
that represents the potential source of leakage under high pressure operation, for example
when the welded seam is not a reliably tight and rigid joint. Furthermore, the maximum length
of the risers that can be formed is limited by the thickness of the sheet material employed.This length limitation also applies to a method of fabricating a metallic conduit having exterior
surface details as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,022,135. In this known process, and extruded
blank is placed in a high pressure die and is exposed to a pressurized fluid, for example oil,
that causes the metal of the blank to flow into cavities of the die, thus forming the exterior
surface details. U.S. Patent No. 4,663,812 discloses a method of manufacturing an integrated or integral
mandrel from an extruded hollow shape or element provided with one or more longitudinally
extending solid integral protruding neck portions. From such neck portions are formed a
plurality of individual solid risers that subsequently are reshaped into hollow risers by a reverse
impact extrusion process. Thereafter, apertures are formed in the wall of the hollow element to
communicate the interior thereof with the hollow risers. There are disclosed two different ways
of forming the solid risers from the protruding neck part. A first such process involves laterally
applying a press tool provided with cylindrical voids. A second method involves the removal of
excess material from the neck part by means of a special cutting tool. The first process
requires a high pressure to achieve the lateral cold
