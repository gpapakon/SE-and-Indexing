<ABSTRACT>
In an apparatus for controlling the idling speed of the engine of a vehicle with two rows of cylinders, each of which is assigned a catalytic converter with a lambda probe, the injection valves of each of the two rows of cylinders are alternately switched off when the engine is idling. This switchover from switching off the injection valves of one row of cylinders to those of the other is performed whenever the temperature of the catalytic converter assigned to the row of cylinders which happens to be switched off undershoots a predetermined limiting temperature. As an alternative, in the case of an apparatus for controlling the idling speed of the engine of a vehicle with just one catalytic converter and one lambda probe, when the engine is idling, the injection valves are switched off sequentially in accordance with a predetermined program as a function of the ignition sequence of the engine. This sequential switching-off of the injection valves is cancelled at least for a predetermined period of time if the temperature of the catalytic converter undershoots a predetermined limiting temperature.

<CLAIMS>
A device for controlling the idling of a motor-vehicle engine comprising
an exhaust-gas catalytic converter and a lambda probe, wherein the device

comprises means which during idling switch off injection valves and switch
them on again at least for a preset time if the temperature (T) of the exhaust

catalytic converter falls below a set limiting temperature (T
G
), 
characterised in
that
 the means for switching off injection valves are constructed so that during
idling of the engine the injection valves are switched off in sequence in

accordance with a set program depending on the engine ignition sequence.
A device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
 when the engine is
idling, the injection valves are sequentially switched off only when the engine

coolant temperature (T
K
) is greater than 80°C and/or the air temperature (T
S
) in
the intake air manifold is greater than 20°C.
A device according to either of the preceding claims, 
characterised in
that
 the sequential switching-off of the injection valves is terminated when the
speed (F
FZG
) of the vehicle is greater than 5 km/h.
A device according to any of the preceding claims, 
characterised in that

the temperature (T) of the exhaust catalytic converter is determined by
measuring or monitoring the voltage (U
L
) of the lambda probe associated with
the corresponding exhaust catalytic converter.
