<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus and a method for extending a pulling range of automatic fine tuning 
of a television receiver. An initial tuning voltage is applied to a tuner when a channel 

switching operation is performed or the television receiver is powered on. The tuning 
voltage to the tuner is controlled by bands as a result of comparison of an automatic fine 

tuning voltage of a specified channel with a first predetermined reference voltage. If the 
automatic fine tuning voltage is higher than the first predetermined reference voltage, it 

is checked whether the automatic fine tuning voltage is within a desired range. The 
tuning voltage to the tuner is controlled by the bands if the automatic fine tuning voltage 

is not within the desired range, to maintain the automatic fine tuning voltage within the 
desired range. Presence of a synchronous signal of the specified channel is checked if 

the automatic fine tuning voltage is within the desired range. If the synchronous signal 
of the specified channel is present, the tuning voltage to the tuner is controlled by the 

bands to maintain the automatic fine tuning voltage within the desired range. If the 
synchronous signal of the specified channel is not present, the initial tuning voltage is 

applied to the tuner to continue to check the presence of the synchronous signal.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates in general to automatic fine tuning (AFT) of a
television (TV) receiver employing a voltage synthesizer (VS), and more particularly to
an apparatus and a method for extending a pulling range of the automatic fine tuning of
the TV receiver, thereby to prevent a shortage in the pulling range of the automatic fine
tuning when a TV channel is switched or the TV receiver is powered on and a detuning
due to a variation in characteristics of components at a high or low temperature.Referring to Fig. 1, there is shown a block diagram of a conventional automatic
fine tuning system for a TV receiver employing a video synthesizer. As shown in this
drawing, the conventional automatic fine tuning system comprises a tuner 24 for tuning
a TV broadcasting signal received through an antenna ANT to a specified channel
corresponding to a tuning voltage from a microcomputer 23 and outputting an
intermediate frequency (IF) signal of the tuned TV broadcasting signal, and an IF
processor 25 for processing the IF signal of the tuned TV broadcasting signal from the
tuner 24 to output an automatic fine tuning voltage VAFT and a synchronous signal to the
microcomputer 23 and a video signal of the tuned TV broadcasting signal to a video
processor 26.The video processor 26 is adapted to process the video signal from the IF 
processor 25 to output red (R), green (G) and blue (B) color signals.The conventional automatic fine tuning system also comprises a key matrix unit
21 for outputting an electrical signal corresponding to a pushed key thereon to the
microcomputer 23, and a remote receiver 22 for receiving a remote signal from a remote
controller (not shown), converting the received remote signal into an electrical signal and
outputting the converted electrical signal to the microcomputer 23.The microcomputer 23 is adapted to check input of the automatic fine tuning
voltage VAFT and the synchronous signal from the IF processor 25. Also, the
microcomputer 23 generates the tuning voltage in response to tuning data from the remote
receiver 22 or the key matrix unit 21 and outputs the generated tuning voltage to the tuner
24, thereby allowing the tuner 24 to tune the channel finely.Also, the conventional automatic fine tuning system comprises an on-screen
display (OSD) character generator 27 for generating a caption character signal addressed
by the microcomputer 23 when the corresponding channel is tuned by the tuner 24, and
a video synthesizer 28 for synthesizing the caption character signal from the
