<ABSTRACT>
A time piece is switched from the before-noon display to after-noon display and vice versa. A cam (26) is 
rotated by an hour wheel (10) and an intermediate wheel (12) one revolution per day. In the morning, a lever (30) is 

in contact with the major-axis side of the cam (26), and at noon, the lever (3) reaches a changing point between the 
major-axis part of the cam (26) and the minor-axis part. When the cam (26) further rotates in the direction indicated 

by arrow (FB), the lever (30) is instantaneously displaced by a spring (34) from the major-axis position of the cam 
(26) to the minor-axis position. The displacement of the lever (30) is transmitted to a movable dial plate (36) by 

means of a tooth section (31) and switching groove (39) provided at the front end of the lever (30) and the dial plate 
(36) is rotated by a prescribed angle in the direction indicated by arrow (FC). Therefore, the before-noon display is 

instantaneously switched to the after-noon display.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a timepiece capable of
switching the time display thereof on a before-noon/after-noon
basis, and a display switching mechanism thereof.Among conventional timepieces, a 12-number timepiece is
predominant which has an hour hand making two turns a day.
Such a timepiece has a dial plate equally divided into twelve
and allows the time to be read on the basis of an hours symbol
pointed by the hour hand. The problem with this kind of
timepiece is that a person cannot distinguish the before-noon
and the after-noon at a glance since hours and minutes are
displayed by exactly the same symbols both the before-noon
hours and the after-noon hours.In light of the above, some timepieces are provided with
an hour hand making a single turn a day in order to display the
time on a 24-hour basis. However, since the display area
available with a portable watch or similar miniature timepiece
is small, dividing it into twenty-four would render the time 
difficult to see. Moreover, a person accustomed to a
predominant 12-numeral timepiece is apt to mistake the time.It is, therefore, preferable to preserve the conventional
hour hand turning round on a 12-numeral basis and, in addition,
to distinguish the before-noon hours and the after-noon hours in
a sure and easy way.A mechanism for switching the time display to
distinguish the before-noon and the after-noon, particularly a
display switching mechanism for a wrist watch, is taught in
Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open Publication No. 63-187088 by
way of example. The mechanism disclosed in this Laid-Open
Publication has an operating wheel making one rotation a day.
An actuator pin is studded on the operating wheel and received
in a switching window formed through a display plate. When
the actuator pin completes one rotation within the window, the
display plate moves a predetermined angle in a reciprocating
motion. As a result, the display is switched from the
before-noon to the after-noon and vice versa.In the above mechanism, a jump and hold spring moves
along a tooth portion formed in the inner periphery of the
display plate and then gets it over, at each transition from
the before-noon to the after-noon and vice versa. This,
however, brings about a problem that at the time of display
switchover, numerals "1" to "12" representing the before-noon
hours and numerals "13" to "24" representing the after-noon 
hours overlap each other little by little, making it
difficulty to see the time.Although the switchover from the after-noon display

<CLAIMS>
A display switching mechanism for a portable
timepiece comprising:


a movable dial plate (36) having on a
circumferential portion symbols representing before-noon

hours and symbols representing after-noon hours arranged
alternately;
a dial plate (40) having twelve windows (42)
circumferentially arranged and covering the movable dial

plate (36) such that either the symbols representing
before-noon hours or the symbols representing after-noon

hours can be seen through said windows (42);
an operating wheel (14) arranged to be driven via
an hour wheel (10) to make one rotation a day;
a cam (26) having a larger radius portion and a
smaller radius portion and rotatable with said operating

wheel (14);
means for causing reciprocating motion of said
movable dial plate (36) about an axis of rotation;

   characterised in that said means for causing
reciprocating motion comprises:


a retainer (38) constantly forcing said movable dial
plate (36) towards a base plate (16);
a lever (30) acting upon the movable dial plate
(36); and
a spring (34) constantly biasing said lever (30)
towards the axis of rotation of said cam (26) whereby

in use, during rotation of said cam (26) said lever (30)
is caused to move from one of said smaller and larger

radius portions to the other, which movement of said
lever (30) causes said movable dial plate (36) to move

from a position in which one of the sets of before-noon
and after-noon hours is displayed to a position in which

the other of the sets of before-noon and after-noon hours
is displayed.
A display switching mechanism for a portable
timepiece as claimed in claim 1, characterised in that

said movable dial plate (36) is substantially annular in
shape and surrounds said operating wheel (14), said cam

(26) and said lever (30) and wherein an extremity of said
lever (30) acts on the inner circumferential edge of said

movable dial plate (36) to cause reciprocating motion.
A display switching mechanism for a portable
timepiece as claimed in either of claims 1 and 2, wherein

a cam pin (28) attached to said cam (26) passes through
a hole (24) in said operating wheel (14), which hole (24)

is significantly larger than said pin (28) allowing the
pin (28) to move within the hole (24).
A display switching mechanism for a portable
timepiece as claimed in any of claims 1, 2 and 3, wherein

said symbols comprise timepiece characters.
A display switching mechanism for a portable
timepiece as claimed in any of claims 1, 2 and 3, wherein

either said symbols representing the before-noon hours
or said symbols representing the after-noon hours

comprises numerals while the remainder of said symbols
comprises letters.
A display switching mechanism for a portable
timepiece as claimed in any of claims 1, 2 and 3, wherein

said symbols comprise symbols imaging the before-noon and
symbols imaging the after-noon.
A portable timepiece comprising said display
switching mechanism as claimed in any one of the

preceding claims.
