<ABSTRACT>
A method of depositing a material upon a substrate (e.g., 11) is 
disclosed. A material, such as photoresist, is deposited upon a substrate (e.g., 11) 

such as a semiconductor wafer by spinning the substrate and commencing deposition 
at the edge (e.g., 51) of the wafer and moving inward in a spiral pattern. The method 

produces a more uniform coating than hitherto available.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to processes for the deposition of coatings upon 
substrates, in general, and more particularly to methods for semiconductor integrated 
circuit fabrication utilizing the deposition of resist-type materials upon 
semiconductor substrates. A variety of modern technologies rely upon the precise deposition of a 
liquid material upon a solid substrate. Although it is frequently desirable to obtain a 
precisely uniform coating, methods for achieving such uniformity are often elusive. A particular example is the semiconductor industry, in which resist 
materials (often photoresist materials) are deposited upon semiconductor wafers. 
The resist materials are subsequently exposed to light through a reticle and then 
portions of the resist are removed so that underlying portions of the substrate may be 
exposed to, for example, etchant or dopant species. Conventional methods for applying photoresist involve the placement of 
a semiconductor wafer upon a chuck in a chamber. An arm having a dispensing tube 
at its end is positioned generally over the center of the wafer. A pump connected to 
the arm is activated and a puddle of photoresist is dumped onto the center of the 
wafer while it spins at a slow speed. Then the wafer is spun at a considerably faster 
speed. Centrifugal force tends to force the photoresist to move outward toward the 
edge of the wafer while surface tension and viscosity effects control the flow over 
the surface and the wafer edge boundary conditions. Eventually the entire wafer is 
coated with photoresist. The conventional approach presents a variety of problems. First, a 
considerable amount of photoresist material is wasted. It is necessary to dump more 
photoresist onto the center of the wafer than is ultimately desired upon the surface of 
the finished wafer. Considerable excess photoresist is spun off the sides during the 
"fast spin" cycle of the process. Furthermore, the process typically produces an 
uneven photoresist coating, not unlike that depicted in FIG. 1. In FIG. 1, reference 
numeral 11 denotes a semiconductor substrate; while reference numeral 13 denotes a 
deposited photoresist. In a photoresist having a nominal thickness of approximately 
1 µm, the difference between the height of point 17 in the center of the wafer and 
point 15, at a location intermediate the center and edge of the wafers, may be 100Å 
to 200Å. Unevenness in photoresist layers is undesirable because it will induce 
variations in the size of critical features (normally placed in
