<ABSTRACT>
A gas turbine combustor in which a part or all of
the wall of the combustor disposed within an intake

chamber is formed as an acoustic energy absorbing member
that can absorb the acoustic energy of a combustion

variation generated within the combustor. The acoustic
energy absorbing member is constructed of a thin

corrugated plate in a circumferential direction, a high-temperature-proof
perforated material, or a back plate

disposed at the outside of a perforated plate in a radial
direction with a distance from the perforated plate. It

is also possible to provide a covering member at the
outside of the acoustic energy absorbing member in a

radial direction, for covering the acoustic energy
absorbing member with a distance from the acoustic energy

absorbing member. It is preferable that the acoustic
energy-absorbing member and/or the covering member are

reinforced with a frame that extends in a circumferential
direction and/or a longitudinal direction.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas turbine
combustor and, more particularly, to a structure of a gas
turbine combustor.Figs. 16A and 16B show a conventional gas turbine
combustor. Fig. 16A is a diagram showing the layout of
the combustor within an intake chamber. A plurality of
gas turbine combustors 10 are laid out in an
approximately ring-shaped intake chamber 30 that is
formed with a casing 20 consisting of an external casing
21 and an internal casing 22 (only one gas turbine
combustor is shown in the drawing).Air from a compressor enters the intake chamber 30,
and passes through the surrounding of the combustor 10
and enters the inside of the combustor 10 from an air
inlet opening 11 at an upper portion of the combustor.
The air is pre-mixed with a fuel separately introduced
from a fuel nozzle 40. The mixture is combusted within
the combustor 10, and the combustion gas is supplied to a
turbine.Fig. 16B is a cross-sectional diagram of an enlarged
portion of (B) in Fig. 16A. A wall 100 of the combustor
10 is constructed of a first wall 200 that extends
straight at the fuel nozzle 40 side, and a second wall
200' that is inclined at a turbine chamber side. The
first wall 200 is a cooling wall provided with a
clearance 105 through which cooling air passes. The
second wall 200' is a double wall cooled with vapor.
Both walls are connected to each other via a spring clip
105.Figs. 17A and 17B show a state where a combustor 10
is supplied with a cover 50 to form a convection cooling 
path 60, based on the structure shown in Figs. 16A and
16B respectively. The air from the compressor is guided
to the convection cooling path 60 to cool the combustor
10, and is then guided to the inside of the combustor 10.
A first wall 200 and a second wall 200' of the combustor
10 have the same structures as those shown in Fig. 16B
respectively. The first wall 200 and the second wall
200' shown in Fig. 16B and Fig. 17B respectively are
acoustically very rigid boundaries, and they hardly
transmit sound waves. Therefore, the resonance
magnification of a sound field within the combustor 10
becomes high, and this can easily bring about what is
called a combustion oscillation phenomenon.The combustion oscillation is a phenomenon that a
frequency component of a pressure variation of a
combustion gas generated due to a generation of a
combustion variation relative to a natural frequency of
the sound field is amplified, and the pressure variation
within the combustor 10 becomes larger. As a result, the
quantities of the fuel and
