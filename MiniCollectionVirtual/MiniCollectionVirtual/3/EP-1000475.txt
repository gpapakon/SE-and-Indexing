<ABSTRACT>
A facility transport system for transporting Ethernet over digital subscriber lines. The system, termed 10BaseS, is capable of transmitting of 10 Mbps Ethernet over existing copper infrastructure. The system utilizes carrierless amplitude modulation phase modulation/quadrature amplitude modulation (CAP/QAM) to transport Ethernet frame data and utilizes splitter means (22) to separate both the downstream and upstream channels from POST signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
 ETHERNET TRANSPORT FACILITY OVER DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINESFIELD OF THE INVENTIONThe present invention relates generally to telecommunication systems and more particularly relates to a system for transporting Ethernet over digital subscriber lines.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere is a growing need among both individuals and enterprises for access to a commonly available, cost effective network that provides speedy, reliable services. There is high demand for a high-speed data network, one with enough bandwidth to enable complex two-way communications. Such an application is possible today if, for example, you have access to a university or a corporation with sufficient finances to build this type of network. But for the average home computer user or small business, access to high speed data networks is expensive or simply impossible. Telephone companies are therefore eager to deliver broadband services to meet this current explosion in demand. One of the problems is that millions of personal computers have found their place in the home market. Today, PCs can be found in approximately 35% of all United States households and a full 50% of United States teenagers own computers. Virtually every PC sold today is equipped with a modem, enabling communication with the outside world via commercial data networks and the Internet. Currently, people use their PCs to send and receive e-mail, to access online services, to participate in electronic commerce and to browse the Internet. The popularity of the Internet is such that there are an estimated 30 million users around the globe. These figures indicate that in the past few years the personal computer has fueled a dramatic increase in data communications and the corresponding demands on the data networks that carry the traffic.The Internet serves as a good example of the increased demands that have been placed on data networks. At first, Internet access consisted of text only data transfers. Recently, with the popularity of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the development of 

Internet browsers such as Mosaic, Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer, the use of graphics has surged on the Internet. While graphics make for a much more interesting way to view information as opposed to plain text, bandwidth consumption is significantly more. A simple background picture with accompanying text requires approximately 10 times the bandwidth needed by text alone. Because of the increased requirement for bandwidth, activities such as browsing home pages or downloading graphics
