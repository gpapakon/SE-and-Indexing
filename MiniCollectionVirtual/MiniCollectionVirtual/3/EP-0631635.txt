<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed are new methods comprising the use of in situ hybridization to detect abnormal nucleic acid sequence copy numbers in one or more genomes wherein repetitive sequences that bind to multiple loci in a reference chromosome spred are either substantially removed and/or their hybridization signals suppressed. The invention termed Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) provides for methods of determining the relative number of copies of nucleic acid sequences in one or more subject genomes or portions thereof (for example, a tumor cell) as a function of the location of those sequences in a reference genome (for example, a normal human genome). The intensity(ies) of the signals from each labeled subject nucleic acid and/or the differences in the ratios between different signals from the labeled subject nucleic acid sequences are compared to determine the relative copy numbers of the nucleic acid sequences in the one or more subject genomes as a function of position along the reference chromosome spread. Amplifications, duplications and/or deletions in the subject genome(s) can be detected. Also provided is a method of determining the absolute copy numbers of substantially all RNA or DNA sequences in subject cell(s) or cell population(s).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to the field of
cytogenetics, and more particularly to the field of molecular
cytogenetics. It concerns methods of determining the relative
copy numbers of nucleic acid sequences in a subject
cell or cell population and/or comparing the nucleic acid
sequence copy numbers of substantially identical sequences in
several cells or cell populations as a function of the
location of those sequences in a reference genome. For
instance, the methods of this invention provide the means to
determine the relative number of copies of nucleic acid
sequences in one or more subject genomes (for example, the DNA
of one tumor cell or a number of cells from a subregion of a
solid tumor) or portions thereof as a function of the location
of those sequences in a reference genome (for example, a
normal human metaphase spread). Further, the invention
provides methods of determining the absolute copy number of
nucleic acid sequences in a subject cell or cell population.Although the examples herein concern human cells and
the language is primarily directed to human concerns, the
concept of this invention is applicable to genomes from any
plant or animal. The genomes compared need only be related
closely enough to have sufficient substantially identical
sequences for a meaningful analysis. For example, a human
genome and that of another primate could be compared according
to the methods of this invention.Chromosome abnormalities are associated with genetic
disorders, degenerative diseases, and exposure to agents known
to cause degenerative diseases, particularly cancer, German,

182-201 (1970); Yunis; "The Chromosomal Basis of Human
Neoplasia," Science, 221: 227-236 (1983); and German,
"Clinical Implication of Chromosome Breakage," in GeneticDamage in Man Caused by Environmental Agents, Berg, Ed., pgs.
65-86 (Academic Press, New York, 1979). Chromosomal
abnormalities can be of several types, including: extra or
missing individual chromosomes, extra or missing portions of a
chromosome (segmental duplications or deletions), breaks,
rings and chromosomal rearrangements, among others.
Chromosomal or genetic rearrangements include translocations
(transfer of a piece from one chromosome onto another
chromosome), dicentrics (chromosomes with two centromeres),
inversions (reversal in polarity of a chromosomal segment),
insertions, amplifications, and deletions.Detectable chromosomal abnormalities occur with a
frequency of one in every 250 human
