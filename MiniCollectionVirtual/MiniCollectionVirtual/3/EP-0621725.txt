<ABSTRACT>
Method and apparatus for processing color document images to 
determine the 

presence of particular image types (high frequency halftone, low 
frequency halftone continuous tone, line art or text) 

in order to designate areas for optimal image processing 
thereof. A multi-separation image defined in terms of color density for 

each separation is 
converted to a luminance-chrominance definition (YES colour space), 

where one component of the image 
represents image intensity (Y). An image segmentation process operates 

on the image intensity 
signal, the results of which are used to determine processing of the 

multi-separation image.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to a system for processing color document 
images, and more particularly to a method for determining the appropriate image type 
segmentation requirements for a color image. In the reproduction of copies of an original document from video image data 
created, for example, by electronic raster input scanning from an original document, one is 
faced with the limited resolution capabilities of the reproducing system and the fact that 
output devices are mostly binary. This is particularly evident when attempting to reproduce 
halftones, lines and continuous tone images. Of course, an image data processing system may 
be tailored so as to offset the limited resolution capabilities of the reproducing apparatus used, 
but this is difficult due to the divergent processing needs required by the different types of 
image which may be encountered. In this respect, it should be understood that the image 
content of the original document may consist entirely of high frequency halftones, low 
frequency halftones, continuous tones, or line copy, or a combination, in some unknown 
degree, of some or all of the above. In the face of these possibilities, optimizing the image 
processing system for one image type in an effort to offset the limitations in the resolution 
capability of the reproducing apparatus used, may not be possible, requiring a compromise 
choice which may not produce acceptable results. Thus, for example, where one optimizes the 
system for low frequency halftones, it is often at the expense of degraded reproduction of high 
frequency halftones, or of line copy, and vice versa. Color original documents, where all or part of the image is represented in one or 
more colors presents an additional challenge for segmentation. Typically, these images are 
defined in terms of Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color density signals, which represent image signals 
derived in scanning the image with intensity sensitive devices with appropriate color filters 
interposed in the path of light reflected thereto from the color document, or created on a 
document creating computer workstation. Each separation of the RGB color density signals 
requires processing in the same manner as the black and white images, e.g., continuous tone 
images required halftoning, halftoned images requires descreening and rescreening, and 
text/line art requires thresholding. This processing may occur after the image has been 
converted to the cyan-magenta-yellow (CMY) color density signals, that will
