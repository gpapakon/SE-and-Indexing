<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to
peritoneal dialysis and solutions for same. More
specifically, the present invention relates to providing
nutrition to peritoneal dialysis patients.Dialysis provides a method for supplementing or
replacing renal function in certain patients.
Principally, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are
utilized. Although dialysis provides in many cases life
saving therapy, there are health issues that must be
addressed in such patients.In hemodialysis, the patient's blood is passed
through an artificial kidney dialysis machine. A
membrane in the machine acts as an artificial kidney for
cleansing the blood. Because it is an extracorporeal
treatment that requires special machinery, there are
certain inherent disadvantages with hemodialysis.To overcome the disadvantages associated with
hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis was developed.
Peritoneal dialysis utilizes the patient's own peritoneum
as a semi-permeable membrane. The peritoneum is the
membranous lining of the body cavity that due to the
large number of blood vessels and capillaries, is capable
of acting as a natural semi-permeable membrane.In peritoneal dialysis, a dialysis solution is
introduced into the peritoneal cavity utilizing a
catheter. After a sufficient period of time, an exchange
of solutes between the dialysate and the blood is
achieved. Fluid removal is achieved by providing a 
suitable osmotic gradient from the blood to the dialysate
to permit water outflow from the blood. This allows the
proper acid-base, electrolyte, and fluid balance to be
returned to the blood. The dialysis solution is then
simply drained from the body cavity through the catheter.Unfortunately, malnutrition is a risk factor for
morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients.
Accordingly, much recent focus has been directed to
improving the nutritional status of such patients. See,
Amino Acid Solutions for CAPD: Rationale and Clinical
Experience, Michael Jones et al, Mineral and Electrolyte
Metabolism, 1992, 18:309-315.Because there is no standard definition of
malnutrition, estimates of the prevalence of malnutrition
in CAPD patients vary. These estimates typically
indicate that approximately 40 to 50% of CAPD patients
are mildly to severely malnourished.A variety of factors contribute to malnutrition in
this patient population. Many factors hinder dialysis
patients from eating nutritious diets. These factors
include: poverty; depression; loss of taste acuity;
dietary restrictions that result in an unpalatable diet;
and
