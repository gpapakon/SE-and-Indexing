<ABSTRACT>
In a method for storing or delivering and transferring carriers for conveyed material into and out of a multi-tier store and a device for carrying out the method, it is proposed, for storing or delivering conveyed material of different dimensions, in particular loaded or unloaded freight containers (16), into or out of a multi-tier store by means of at least one shelf conveyor (4) movable in an aisle (3) of the store and by means of at least one shelf side (17, 18) located next to the aisle and having standing places (17a-e, 18a-e) for storing the carriers for conveyed material at the ends, for the purpose of storing or delivering and transferring conveying containers of different dimensions, particularly loaded or unloaded containers, into or out of multi-tier stores, in order to predetermine the position to be assumed by the container in a rack of the store in the event of storage at the ends, that, after a positioning of the loaded or unloaded carrier for conveyed material on the shelf conveyor in a position corresponding to the position at the ends in a shelf compartment, the carrier is deposited at the correct location in the shelf compartment by the self conveyor.

Device for storage and retrieval and/or stacking of carriers (16) for material to be
handled into and/or out of a rack (17/18) with a plurality of locations, by means of

a stacker crane (4) movable along a rack side and equipped with a load-carrying
device (12) able to move into the locations, characterized in that the load-carrying

device (12) has rollers (35) for the positioning of the carriers, that the load-carrying
device (12) is designed in the form of not less than one roller desk

capable of being lifted or lowered and that it is supported by a platform (11) via
not less than two roller sets (13,14) drivable or lockable by the stacker crane (4),

that in case of storage and retrieval or stacking of carriers into or out of the
location at a rack side, the not less than two drivable and lockable roller sets act

together with supports available in the location, that an open loop control system
(15) is provided in the stacker crane (4) which, depending on a preset precise

final storage of the carriers (16) causes the stop of the roller desk rollers (35), of
the not less than two roller sets (13,14) and of the lifting and lowering of the not

less than one roller desk (12).
Device as per claim 1, characterized in that due to the reversal of its conveying
direction, the not less than one roller desk (12) with the not less than two roller

sets (13,14) may serve locations on both rack sides in case of rack arrangement
on the right and on the left of the aisle.
Device as per one of the above-mentioned claims, characterized in that the not
less than one roller desk (12) is composed of several roller desk sections (12a-e)

which are elastically connected one after the other.
Device as per one of the above-mentioned claims, characterized in that in case of
a desk or several desks arranged beside one another or one above the other or

like a cross at an angle of 90 degrees to each other (11) and in case of several
roller set sections (13,14,68) with roller desk sections (12a-e, 69) arranged on

each platform one behind the other, each roller set section and each roller desk
section is provided with a power connection for the power supply arranged on the 

not less than one platform.
Device as per claim 4, characterized in that the roller set sections (68) and the
roller desk sections (69) can be coupled depending on the length of a carrier (16).
Device as per claim 4 or 5, characterized in that telescopic conductor rails are
provided between the power supply on the platform (11) and the power

connections at the roller set sections (68) and roller desk sections (69) and that
the roller set sections and the roller desk sections carry slider contacts as current

collectors.
Device as per one of the claim 1 to 5, characterized in that in case of a platform
(11) or several platforms (11) arranged beside one another or one above the

other or like a cross at an angle of 90 degrees to each other and in case of
several roller set sections (68) with roller desk sections (69) arranged one behind

the other on the platform, each roller set section and each roller desk section is
provided with a battery on the at least one platform (11).
