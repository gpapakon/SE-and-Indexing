<CLAIMS>
Axle guide of a bogie (1) with a bogie frame (2) and axles,
which is equipped with coil springs (5) as primary suspension,

and in which steering and traction forces are transmitted from
the axles to the bogie frame (2) solely by the coil springs (5)

arranged in pairs, with an emergency guide pin (6) located along
the centre line of each coil spring (5) and extending at its

upper end with radial play through a bore (14) in the base of the
cup-shaped upper base plate (10) fixed to the bogie frame (2),

wherein the base of the upper base plate (10) forms a counter
stop (13) for a limit stop (11) located on the upper end of the

emergency guide pin (6) which passes through the bore (14), and
with an additional lower base plate (9), wherein each coil spring

(5) is mounted between the upper and lower base plates (9, 10),
and the emergency guide pin (6) together with the lower base

plate (9) is bolted to the axle-box case (8), and also with a
further limit stop (12) below the upper base plate (10) and

working in conjunction with the upper base plate (10),
characterized in that the emergency guide pin (6) has two limit

stops (11, 12) and that the limit stops (11, 12) are adjustable.
Axle guide according to claim 1, characterized in that the
coil springs (5) form prestressable spring assemblies over the

base plates (9, 10) located at both ends and the emergency guide
pin (6) securely fixed to one of the two base plates.
