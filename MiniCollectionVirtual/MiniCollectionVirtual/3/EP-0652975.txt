<ABSTRACT>
The present invention provides a genetic test for assaying predisposition to and/or resistance to high rates of bone turnover, development of low bone mass and responsiveness or otherwise to therapeutic modalities. This is a specific model for use in prediction of osteoporosis and likely response to preventive or therapeutic modalities. It is a general model of allelic variation in transcriptional regulators determining physiological set-points and thus susceptibility or resistance to certain pathophysiological states.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of
identifying allelic differences in trans-acting factors
as a means of identifying individuals at risk to suffer
from an adverse pathophysiological condition. The
method of the present invention is particularly useful
in assessing allelic variations in the vitamin D
receptor gene and thereby predicting predisposition to
low or high bone density. Moreover these variants
could be used to predict long-term risk of osteoporosis
as well as predicting responsiveness to therapy relating
to bone density. This effect is also a model of
determination of predisposition to or resistance to
other pathological or physiological variations due to
other transcription factor gene variants and thus
determining risk of disease and of response to therapy.
Such transcriptional regulators could be, but not
limited to, ligand-activated gene regulators such as
the steroid/retinoid/thyroid hormone receptor gene
family.Vitamin D functions as a potent regulator of bone
and calcium homeostasis as well as of cellular
differentiation and replication in many target tissues.
It acts as its dihydroxylated metabolite
(1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or calcitriol) through the
highly specific vitamin D receptor (1). This
trans-acting transcriptional activator protein mediates
calcitriol action in the regulation of the expression
of target genes. Cloning the vitamin D receptor gene
(2,3) showed it to be a member of the ligand-activated
receptor superfamily that includes the receptors for
steroid hormones (glucocorticoids, progesterone,
estrogen, androgen, and mineralocorticoids) as well as
thyroid hormones and vitamin A derivatives (4,5), 
natural regulators of a large number of physiological
and developmental processes. The mechanisms by which
these receptor proteins mediate the regulation of gene
expression has been a subject of intense research.
Rare overt mutations have been identified that
compromise the function of receptors and that cause
major functional disorders in humans and animals. For
example, mutations in the vitamin D receptor gene,
resulting in vitamin D-resistant rickets (6), and in
the androgen receptor, resulting in androgen
insensitivity (7), have been reported, and in the
estrogen receptor gene an infrequent natural
polymorphism has been correlated with a high rate of
spontaneous abortion (8). However, despite a wealth of
molecular information, little is known of the potential
contribution of natural allelic variation in receptor
genes to diversity of response to steroidal hormones
