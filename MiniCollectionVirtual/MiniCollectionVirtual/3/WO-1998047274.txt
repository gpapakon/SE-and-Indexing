<ABSTRACT>
Communication system including message devices (BV1 - BV3) for providing messages in one of different languages, wherein a list of at least one preferred language assigned to a subscriber may be entered via subscriber input/retrieval means (EA1, EA2), stored in storage means (S) and be retrieved and displayed from the storage means (S). A list with at least one preferred language, assigned to a calling or called subscriber, may be used to provide a calling and/or called subscribers with a message in one of preferred languages.

<DESCRIPTION>
 Communication system for providing messages in different languagesThe present invention relates to a communication system including message means for providing messages in a language according to the preamble of patent claim 1.In a communication system, for example as known from DE 44 30 991, it may be required to provide subscribers with messages related to certain system statuses, or to provide subscribers with messages related to certain system services. These messages are usually transmitted to a calling subscriber, however, may also be transmitted to a called subscriber. Particularly in mobile communications systems covering a plurality of countries, it may occur that messages are provided by units of the communication system, which are located far away from the subscriber, for example in a region or country with a different language. In this case a message may be transmitted in a language which is not understood by the subscriber. For example, a subscriber placing a call to another country and dialing an invalid extension will be provided with a message like "you dialed an invalid extension number" in the language of the respective country. Moreover, because of free subscriber-roaming, in a mobile communication network it is possible that the subscriber at different times roams within regions having differing official languages. In this case, even if a subscriber is provided with a message from a local unit of the network, the subscriber will receive messages in different languages. 

Moreover, the home location register of a subscriber, storing subscriber related data, is not necessarily located within a region having an official language understood by the subscriber. Here, too, in case of a notification, it is possible that a message is transmitted in a language not understood by the subscriber.To avoid communication problems when transmitting messages to a subscriber, it is desirable to be able to provide a subscriber with a message in a language understood by the subscriber. This is particularly desirable in a mobile communication network, for example a communication network according to the GSM-standard.DE 44 30 991 describes a communication network allowing to transmit a message to a caller in different languages. The network may, in particular, be a mobile communication network, e.g. a GSM-network. For selecting a message, a notification number is generated, consisting of a fixed portion of digits for determining the type of the message, and consisting of a variable portion of digits for

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS :
1. Communication system including message means (BV) for providing messages in one of different languages, comprising:
at least one transmission device (UEV1, UEV2, UEV3) ;
at least two communication devices (Tl, T2, T3) ;
at least one storage device (S) for storing at least one list comprising at least one preferred language, while each of the at least one lists is assigned to one subscriber;
at least one message device (BVl, BV2, BV3) for providing messages in different languages;
c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that
a list with at least one preferred language assigned to a subscriber is transmitted between said at least two communication devices (Tl, T2, T3) , or other units of the communication system, during establishing a connection or during an existing connection, and the at least one message device (BVl, BV2, BV3) transmits a message to one of the at least two communication devices (Tl, T2, T3) in one of the preferred languages of the list, or in a predetermined language;
at least one subscriber input/retrieval device (EAl, EA2) is provided, for storing a list with at least one preferred language in the at least one storage device (S) 


and for retrieving and displaying the list from said at least one storage device (S) ; and
each of the at least one subscriber input/retrieval devices (EAl, EA2) include input means (Kl, K2) for entering sequences of digits or characters, and include display means (Dl, D2) for displaying a list of at least one preferred language.
2. Communication system according to claim 1, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that each of the at least one subscriber input/retrieval devices (EAl, EA2 ) , together with a respective one of the communication devices (Tl, T2, T3) , constitute a unit.
3. Communication system according to claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the at least one list includes a plurality of preferred languages in a specific sequence.
4. Communication system according to claim 1 or 2, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that only in case a subscriber is to be notified, during establishing a communication the list with the at least one preferred language is transmitted to the corresponding message device (BVl, BV2, BV3) .
5. Communication system according to one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the at least one message device (BVl, BV2, BV3) transmits a message to the communication device (Tl, T2, T3) of the calling and/or called subscriber. 

6. Communication system according to one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that a list with at least one preferred language, assigned to a calling and/or a called subscriber, is transmitted, and, in case of a notification of the communication device of the calling and/or called subscriber, a message is transmitted in a language according to the corresponding list.
7. Communication system according to one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that first temporary storage means (TSl) are provided, connected to the first transmission device (UEV1), for storing a list with at least one preferred language assigned to a subscriber served by the first transmission device (UEV1) ;
second temporary storage means (TS2) are provided connected to the second transmission device (UEV2); and
means are provided for deleting the list of preferred languages in the first temporary storage means (TSl) and for storing the list in the second temporary storage means (TS2) , in case the subscriber moves from the area covered by the first temporary storage means (TSl) into the area covered by the second temporary storage means (TS2) .
8. Communication system according to one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that 


the at least one message device (BVl, BV2, BV3) includes determining means (PVl) for selecting, in accordance with the sequence of languages in the list, the first language available at the at least one message device, and for initiating that the message is transmitted to a communication device (Tl) in the selected language or, in case none of the languages is available, for initiating that the message is transmitted to the communication device (Tl) in a predetermined language.
9. Communication system according to one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the at least one message device (BVl, BV2, BV3) includes retrieval means (AVI) for retrieving a list with at least one preferred language from storage means (S, TSl, TS2), in case the list is not or not properly transmitted from a communication device (Tl, T2, T3) to message device (BVl, BV2, BV3) .
10. Communication system according to one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that the at least one subscriber input/retrieval device (EAl, EA2) is arranged to transmit sequences of digits or characters to said at least one storage device (S), the sequences of numbers or characters constituting country codes or international country abbreviations.
11. Communication system according to one of the preceding claims, c h a r a c t e r i z e d in that 


the communication system is a mobile communication network and/or a telephone network according to the GSM-standard and/or a fixed telephone network.
