<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the purification of 2-methylglutaronitrile 
or adiponitrile which contain boron residues from the process of butadiene 
reacting with with hydrogen cyanide using a nickel catalyst and a boron 
compound as a promoter. The boron residue is reacted with an alcohol, and the 
nitrile is separated from the mixture by distillation. Drinkard U.S. Patent 3,496,218 discloses the preparation of 
nitriles by the reaction of hydrogen cyanide and butadiene in the presence of a 
nickel catalyst and a boron promoter. Other improvement patents on this 
technology include Rapoport U.S. Patent 4,330,483 and Barnette et al. U.S. 
Patent 4,339,395. When 2-methylglutaronitrile and adiponitrile are manufactured by 
the above processes, the reaction mixture includes not only these nitrile 
products, but also organo boron compounds that are difficult to separate from 
the nitriles by simple distillation. These nitriles are hydrogenated to 
hexamethylenediamine and 2-methylpentamethylenediamine, and the diamines 
are used in the manufacture of nylons. The organo boron compounds contained 
in the nitriles render the hydrogenation catalysts less effective by limiting the 
catalysts' activity, selectivity, and life. An object of the present invention is to produce higher quality 
adiponitrile and 2-methylglutaronitrile, higher yields of diamine upon 
hydrogenation of the nitriles, and less undesirable by-products such as benzene, 
which is produced by thermal decomposition of the boron contaminants. The present invention is a process for the purification of a mixture 
containing (1) a nitrile selected from the group consisting of adiponitrile and 2-methylglutaronitrile, 
and (2) an organo boron compound, which comprises 
adding an alcohol selected from the group consisting of amino alcohols and 
glycols, and then recovering the nitrile by distillation. (The alcohol must have 
(a) at least two OH groups or (b) an NH2 or NHR or NR2 group, where R is 
methyl or ethyl and one OH group.) The organo-boron compound may be a 
mixture of compounds and may include one or more of the following: triphenyl 
boron, phenyl t-butylcatecholboronate, phenyl boronic acid, its anhydride or its  
 
esters. The amount of alcohol added is preferably at least stoichiometrically 
equivalent to the amount of organo boron compounds present. The preferred 
alcohols are selected from the group consisting of triethanolamine, 
pentaerythritol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butanediol, 
and
