<ABSTRACT>
A guide rail (10) exhibits running surfaces (19), which are separated from one another by a longitudinal slot (20), and a carrying part (9) which is supported on said running surfaces, is guided displaceably and non-rotatably in the guide rail and on which there is fastened, in a suspended manner, a closure element, preferably a doorleaf (7) of a sliding folding door. In order to be able to connect, in a simple and rapid manner, the closure element, borne by the carrying part, to the guide rail, the carrying part (9) exhibits an elongate carriage part (14) which is guided in the guide rail and is of a width which corresponds to the longitudinal slot of the guide rail. In the carrying part (9) there is mounted rotatably, but axially non-displaceably, in a bore which is at right angles to the guide rail (10), a bolt (27) which bears, in the region of the carriage part (14), a hammer-head-like head (26) whose width is smaller, and whose length is greater, than the width of the longitudinal slot (20). The bolt (27) can be locked to the carrying part (9) in a position in which the head (26) is supported on the running surfaces (19).

Guide rail (10) with running tracks (19) separated by a 
longitudinal slot (20) and with a carrier element (9) guided 

in said guide rail (10) and supported by said running tracks 
(19) to allow longitudinal, non-rotational motion, to which 

carrier element (9) is suspended a closure element, 
preferably a door leaf (7) of a folding sliding door,
characterised in that
 
the carrier element (9) exhibits an oblong slide element 

(14) guided in the guide rail (10), said slide element (14) 
having a width corresponding to the longitudinal slot (20) 

of the guide rail (10), that pivot-mounted in the carrier 
element (9) in a hole arranged at right angles to the guide 

rail (10) is an axially fixed pin (27) having a T-shaped 
hammer-like head (26) in the area of the slide element (14), 

the width of which hammer-shaped head (26) is smaller than, 
and the length of which is greater than the width of the 

longitudinal slot (20), and that the pin (27) may be locked 
to the carrier element (9) in a position in which the 

hammer-shaped head (26) is supported by the running tracks 
(19). 
Guide rail according to Claim 1, characterised in that, 
connected to the slide element (14) of the carrier element 

(9) is a base element (13) running transverse to said 
carrier element (9), on which base element (13) is fixed 

transverse to the guide rail (10) the hinge arm (12) of a 
furniture hinge. 
Guide rail according to Claim 2, characterised in that, 
fixed to the base element (13) is a carrier plate (37) on 

which the hinge arm (12) is located by a self-locking 
adjusting device (41, 44, 45) to allow transverse movement. 
Guide rail according to Claim 3, characterised in that the 
carrier plate (37) is located on the base element (13) to 

allow longitudinal movement, and may be secured by a fixing  
 

screw which passes through a keyhole-like oblong hole (49) 
of the web portion (48) of the carrier plate (37). 
Guide rail according to Claim 4, characterised in that the 
fixing screw (38) also acts as the clamping screw for the 

pin (37) carrying the hammer-shaped head (26). 
Guide rail according to one of Claims 1 to 5, characterised 
in that the pin (27) is provided with an angled actuating 

portion (31) which, in one position in which the hammer-shaped 
head (26) is located transverse to the longitudinal 

slot (20), is located against a flank (52) of the base 
element (13). 
Guide rail according to one of Claims 2 to 6, characterised 
in that the adjusting and fixing screws are located on that 

side of the base element (13) which, when the folding 
sliding door is closed, faces the adjoining construction 

wall (2). 
Guide rail according to one of Claims 1 to 7, characterised 
in that the slide element (14) features at both ends fork-like 

extensions (22), in each of which is located a pin 
carrying a roller (24), and that the rollers (24) are 

located between the edges (56), delimiting the longitudinal 
slot (20), of the profile section of the guide rail (10). 
Guide rail according to one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised 
in that the slide element (14) is of mirrored symmetrical 

design in respect of its vertical transverse plane (32) and 
the carrier element (9) is of mirrored symmetrical design in 

respect of its vertical longitudinal centreline plane (33). 
Guide rail according to one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised 
in that the hammer-shaped head (26) is mounted in a central 

window-like opening (25) of the slide element (14). 
Guide rail according to one of Claims 2 to 10, characterised 
in that the slide element (14) integrated as a single piece  

 
with the base element (13) consists of an injection 

moulding. 
Guide rail according to one Claims 1 to 11, characterised in 
that the hammer-shaped head (26), and possibly the rollers 

(24), are injection mouldings.
