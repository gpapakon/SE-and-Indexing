<ABSTRACT>
Biometric measuring apparatus for recognizing a person's identity based on measurements performed on the person's hand. An arrangement for producing (11) and storing (13) a silhouette image of at least a portion of a person's hand is combined with an arrangement for producing (11) and storing (21A) a displacement image of the same portion of a person's hand which can be correlated (30) with said stored silhouette image to provide measurement data on finger height characteristics. An analyzing device analyzes said stored silhouette image and said stored displacement image to produce hand feature data, including hand feature data derived at least in part from finger height characteristics. A comparing device (60) compares hand bid data with hand enrollment data to decide on the basis of prearranged decision criteria whether said hand bid data and said hand enrollment data were produced by the same hand portion.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates generally to identification methods and systems for use
in physical and logical access control systems. Physical access control pertains to
systems such as security locks whereas logical access control pertains to
electronic systems such as electronic funds transfer, ATM or confidential data
base systems. More specifically this invention relates to biometric measuring
apparatus and methods for recognizing a person's identity based on measurements
performed on the person's hand.Biometric recognition systems generally involve recognition of a person by
presentation of some physical characteristic of the person to a machine. These
systems have been shown to have value in various security applications including 
facility access control. Biometric recognition based on hand or palm characteristics
has been proposed in a number of prior art references.Kondo U.S. Patent 4,206,441 discloses a palm pattern detector system and
discusses various approaches to hand feature extraction. The system of the Kondo
'441 patent utilizes a two dimensional image of the person's hand.An SRI International Technical Report entitled "Automatic Palmprint
Verification Study" by Young & Hammon (RADC-TR-81-161) dated June 1981,
discusses approaches to hand feature extraction based on a two dimensional image
of the hand.Shuto U.S. Patent 4,537,193 discloses the use of guide means to assist in
reproducible positioning of the hand of the person being measured by the
apparatus.Sidlauskas U.S. Patent 4,736,203 discloses a three dimensional hand profile
identification apparatus. A pair of orthogonal retroreflecting surfaces are
utilized to present concurrently a plan view and a profile view of a human hand to
an imaging system. The addition of a profile view affords the opportunity to
extract additional hand feature data, but it consists of an overall hand profile
as the third dimensional image and does not provide any basis for extracting a
third dimension of feature information on individual fingers.A commercial version of the Sidlauskas system offered by Recognition
Systems, Inc. of San Jose, California is sold under the trademark "Handkey." The 
Handkey system also uses hand positioning guides on
its retroflective platen to aid in reproducible finger
positioning during both the hand enrollment operation
cycle and the hand bid operation cycle.Hand enrollment involves performing an initial
measurement on a person's hand and storing the hand
feature data extracted as hand enrollment data. Hand
bidding involves a
