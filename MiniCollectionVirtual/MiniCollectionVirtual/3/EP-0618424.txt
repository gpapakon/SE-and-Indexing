<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an electrical ignitor (detonator, fuze) (1) having a metallic retaining part (2) for a detonating resistor, a first contact pin (3), a second contact pin (4) and at least one ignition charge (5, 6). In order that electrostatic discharges between contact pins and the housing do not cause detonation of the ignition charge, it is proposed according to the invention that the retaining part (2) be capable of being extrusion-coated with plastic and be capable of being inserted into a housing, that a first circumferential expansion (8) be provided on the retaining part (2) and be electrically conductively connected to the first contact pin (3), that a second circumferential expansion (9) be provided on the retaining part (2), which second circumferential expansion (9) can be constructed such that it reaches as far as the housing with a small amount of clearance and whose outer end is not extrusion-coated with plastic.
