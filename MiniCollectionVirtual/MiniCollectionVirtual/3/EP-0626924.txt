<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to safety devices of the kind
defined in the first part of claim 1
including a holder having a hollow
main body section and a receptacle end extending therefrom, the holder further having an
open end through which at least a portion of a container is insertable into the main body
section, the receptacle end of the holder being arranged to mate with a needle assembly
having first and second ends such that at least a portion of the second end extends into the
main body section, the safety device including a housing
having
a base secured directly on the receptacle end of the holder and
an elongated body portion pivotable to a position in substantial alignment
along the longitudinal axis of the needle assembly to envelop the first end of the needle
assembly, wherein the housing retains the needle assembly with the holder when the body
portion encloses the needle assembly.In particular, the present invention relates to a needle protection device to be used
with a fluid holding tube which is adaptable to prevent a user, or a bystander, from being
accidentally pricked by the sharp end of a contaminated needle.In US-A-5139489 there is described a safety device for a double-ended needle assembly
holder
according to the first part of claim 1,
used in conjunction with an evacuated blood collection tube. The safety device has a
housing that is pivotable to a position in substantial alignment with the longitudinal axis of
the needle such that, once the housing is pivoted to the alignment position, the needle is
retained therein so as to preclude the sharp end of the needle from being exposed. The device
described in US-A-5139489 works well but for the fact that the user of the device, for example a
phlebotomist or a nurse, is oftentimes blocked by the housing from having a clear view of the
tip of the needle (cannula). To elaborate, ordinarily a phlebotomist, when obtaining fluid, as
for example blood, from a patient, would position the cannula such that its bevel faces up. For
this discussion, the bevel of a cannula is understood to be the sharp, butting end of the
cannula. The reason that a phlebotomist wants to position the bevel of the cannula to face up
is so that he can see the sharp point, rather than the round end, of the cannula so that the
cannula can be more easily and accurately inserted into, for example the vein, of a patient.
But since the needle assembly is threaded into the safety device described in US5139489 such
that it may end up in any orientation, the safety housing

<CLAIMS>
A safety device including a holder (2) having a hollow main body section (4)
and a receptacle end (6) extending therefrom, the holder (2) further having an open

end (12) through which at least a portion of a container (46) is insertable into
the main body section (4), the receptacle end (6) of the holder (2) being arranged

to mate with a needle assembly (30) having first and second ends (28T; 42)
such that at least a portion of the second end (42) extends into the main body

section (4), the safety device including a housing (20) having a base secured directly
on the receptacle end (6) of the holder (2)

and an elongated body portion pivotable to a position in
substantial alignment along the longitudinal axis of the needle assembly (30) to

envelop the first end (28T) of the needle assembly (30) wherein the housing (20) retains
the needle assembly (30) with the holder (2) when the body portion encloses the

needle assembly (30), characterised in that the base
portion (18) of the housing (20) is rotatably secured

to allow rotation of the body portion of the housing
(20) about the holder (2) but to prevent longitudinal movement of the base

portion relative to the holder (2).
A safety device according to Claim 1, characterised in that the receptacle end
(6) has at its outer circumference an annular boss (16), and that an internal

circumferential groove (22) on the base portion (18) is rotatably mated to at
least a portion of the boss (16).
A safety device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the body
portion of the housing (20) comprises a longitudinal sheath having an

elongated slot through which the first end of the needle assembly (30) passes
when the sheath is pivoted to the alignment position. 
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the body portion is integrally connected to the base portion (18) by a

flexible hinge (24).
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the needle assembly (30) comprises a hub (38), and that the receptacle end

(6) of the holder (2) is internally threaded for threadedly mating with the hub
of the needle assembly.
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the body portion of the housing (20) includes at least a cap portion (54), a

main portion (52), and means (58) adapted to the cap portion (54) to secure the
tip of the first end (28T) of the needle assembly (30) substantially sealingly

after the body portion has been pivoted to the alignment position and the cap
portion (54) urged toward the main portion.
A safety device according to Claim 6, including a collapsible section (60)
interposed between and integrally connecting the cap (54) and the main portion

(52), characterised in that the collapsible section (60) collapses to cause the
sealing means (58) sealingly to secure the tip of the first end (28T) of the

needle assembly (30) sealingly when the cap (54) and main portions (52) are
relatively urged toward each other after the body portion has been pivoted to

the alignment position.
A safety device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in
that the safety device includes means (70, 76, 80) for effecting friction contact

between the receptacle end (6) and the base portion (18) such that the housing
(20) is rotatable about the holder (2) only when a torque force is applied

thereagainst relative to the holder. 
A safety device according to Claim 8, characterised in that the friction contact
means comprises at least one bump (70) integrated to the outer circumference

of the receptacle end (6) of the holder (2).
A safety device according to Claim 8, characterised in that the friction contact
means comprises at least one fin-like extension (80) integrated to the outer

circumference of the receptacle end (6) of the holder (2).
A safety device according to Claim 8, characterised in that the friction contact
means comprises at least one fin-like extension (90) formed at the inner

circumference of the base portion (18).
