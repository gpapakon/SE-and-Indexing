<ABSTRACT>
The invention provides a method for the solvent-extraction of β-carotene 
from an aqueous algal biomass suspension, whereby a vegetable oil 

which is immiscible with water is mixed with an aqueous biomass 
suspension, the biomass containing the β-carotene, to form a mixture of 

the organic phase and the aqueous suspension, whereby the β-carotene 
is caused to dissolve in the organic phase. This is followed by separation 

of the organic phase from the aqueous phase by passing the organic 
phase containing the dissolved β-carotene through a semi-permeable 

membrane to effect microfiltration or ultrafiltration of the organic phase. 
The membrane is of a material which is hydrophobic and the organic 

phase is passed through the membrane with a pressure drop across the 
membrane which is lower than that which causes the aqueous phase to 

pass through the membrane.

<DESCRIPTION>
THIS INVENTION relates to the solvent extraction of oil-soluble 
organic compounds from aqueous biomass suspensions. More 
particularly it relates to a method for the solvent extraction of an oil-soluble 
organic compound from an aqueous biomass suspension, 
suitable for extracting β-carotene from an aqueous algal biomass 
suspension. According to the invention, in the solvent-extraction of β-carotene 
from an aqueous algal biomass suspension whereby an 
organic phase in the form of a vegetable oil which is immiscible with 
water is mixed with a suspension in an aqueous phase of an algal 
biomass, the biomass containing the β-carotene, to form a mixture of 
the organic phase and the aqueous phase, whereby the β-carotene is 
caused to dissolve in the organic phase, followed by separation of the 
organic phase from the aqueous phase, there is provided the method 
whereby the separation is effected by passing the organic phase 
containing the dissolved β-carotene through a semi-permeable 
membrane to effect microfiltration or ultrafiltration of the organic 
phase, the membrane being of a material which is hydrophobic and 
the organic phase being passed through the membrane with a pressure 
drop across the membrane which is lower than that which causes the 
aqueous phase to pass through the membrane. By 'hydrophobic' is meant that the contact angle exhibited by 
a droplet of water on a surface provided by the material of the 
membrane is >90°, and the contact angle is preferably as high as  
 
practicable for the purpose of the method of the present invention, 
bearing in mind practical and economic considerations. The aqueous algal biomass suspension may be of halophilic 
algae of the genus Dunaliella. Conveniently the algae may be of the 
species Dunaliella salina and the variety bardawil. Examples of other 
halophilic species of Dunaliella are Dunaliella parva, Dunaliella 
tertiolecta, Dunaliella primolecta, Dunaliella peircei, etc. All of 
these are well known but the presently preferred are high-β-carotene-producing 
strains of the species Dunaliella salina. Dunaliella salina 
is particularly suitable for producing β-carotene by the process 
according to the invention from saline solutions. The biomass suspension may be relatively concentrated, the 
concentration of biomass solids in the suspension, on a dry basis, 
being at least 0,1 g/ℓ, preferably 0,5 - 100 g/ℓ, typically 5 - 20 g/ℓ, 
eg 10 g/ℓ. The concentration of β-carotene in the suspension may be 
0,1-12 % by mass of the solids, on a dry basis,
