<ABSTRACT>
The expansion dowel exhibits an expansion sleeve (1) and an expansion element (5). The expansion sleeve (1) is provided with a bore (2) which tapers in the setting direction and with open longitudinal slots (3). The expansion element (5) exhibits a blind bore (6), open towards the setting-direction-side end, and, at the opposite end, a pin (7) projects beyond said element, the cross-sections of pin (7) and blind bore (6) being matched to one another such that a predetermined breaking point is formed. The force-dependent response of this predetermined breaking point results in a force-dependent expansion, while maintaining the advancement path (X).

An expansion anchor having an expansion sleeve (1) which has at least one 
longitudinal slit (3) open towards its end in the direction of placement, as well as a 

hole (2) tapering towards its end in the direction of placement, wherein an expansion 
body (5) is provided, which tapers at least partially towards the end in the direction 

of placement, which can be inserted in the hole (2), and which has a recess open 
towards the end in the direction of placement for partial radial deformation, 

characterised in that the recess in the expansion body (5) is formed as a blind hole 
(6) and the expansion body has an outwardly protruding plug (7) on its end face (5b) 

facing away from the direction of placement, the axial projection of the cross-section 
of which plug lies within the axial projection of the cross-section of the adjacent 

region (6a) of the blind hole (6). 
An expansion anchor according to claim 1, characterised in that the blind hole (6) and 
the plug (7) are centrally disposed in relation to the expansion body (5). 
An expansion anchor according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the blind hole 
(6) tapers in the direction of placement. 
An expansion anchor any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the largest 
diameter of the blind hole 6 corresponds to 0.3 to 0.5 times the largest outside 

diameter of the expansion body (5). 
An expansion anchor according to any one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the 
plug (7) has a circular cross-section with an outside diameter which corresponds to 

0.3 to 0.5 times the largest outside diameter of the expansion body (5).  
 
An expansion anchor according to any one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the 
length of the plug (7) corresponds to 0.3 to 0.5 times the largest outside diameter of 

the expansion body (5). 
An expansion anchor according to any one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that the 
length of the blind hol
e (6) corresponds to 0.8 to 0.9 times the length of the 
expansion body (5) measured without the plug (7).
