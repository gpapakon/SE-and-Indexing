<ABSTRACT>
In a known device for controlling the idle speed of an internal combustion engine in order to control a quantity of fuel which can be fed into at least two flow lines of the internal combustion engine, a leakage flow can occur which is to be prevented. It is proposed, according to the invention, to arrange the first valve closing element (42) and the second valve closing element (52) axially displaceable relative to one another and to couple them by way of a driver device (60), in such a way that, with the first valve closing element (42) in the closed position, the second valve closing element (52) is also closed and the second valve closing element (52) is adjustable in the valve opening direction only once a predetermined opening position of the first valve closing element (42) is attained. The closing characteristics of the device (10) can be adapted according to requirements by the choice of spring arrangement and design of the springs (28, 54) acting on the valve closing elements (42, 52). The device is especially suitable for controlling the idling speed of a mixture-compressing internal combustion engine with applied ignition by controlling a quantity of fuel which can be fed to the internal combustion engine by way of a fuel metering device and an inlet port.

Device for controlling the idle speed of an 
internal combustion engine with air-assisted fuel injection, 

with a first flow cross-section of a first flow 
line (34), the said cross-section being controllable by 

means of a first valve-closing member (42), and a second 
flow cross-section of a second flow line (35), the said 

cross-section being controllable by means of a second 
valve-closing member (52), the first flow line being 

connectable to a fuel metering device of the internal 
combustion engine and the second flow line being 

connectable to an intake duct of the internal combustion 
engine downstream of a throttling element arranged in the 

intake duct, and with an electromechanical actuating 
drive (11) which is arranged in a drive housing (12) and 

with an adjusting member (22) which is coupled to the 
actuating drive (11) and by means of which the first 

valve-closing member (42) and the second valve-closing 
member (52) can be adjusted from a closed position to an 

open position, characterized in that the first valve-closing 

member (42) and the second valve-closing member 
(52) are arranged in such a way as to be axially 

displaceable relative to one another, and the first and 
second valve-closing member (42, 52) are coupled in such 

a way by a catch device (60) that, when the first valve-closing 
member (42) is in the closed position, the second 

valve-closing member (52) is likewise closed and the 
second valve-closing member (52) can be adjusted in the 

valve-opening direction only after a predetermined open 
position of the first valve-closing member (42) has been  

 
reached. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the first valve-closing member (42) is arranged on 

an end of the adjusting member (22) remote from the 
actuating drive (11), and the second valve-closing member 

(52) is mounted in axially displaceable fashion on the 
adjusting member (22) or on a catch ring (62) connected 

to the adjusting member (22) and/or on a stop body (27) 
and reaches through the adjusting member (22). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the adjusting member (22) projects through the 

second valve-closing member (52) with a radial clearance 
and in that a flexible diaphragm (67) is arranged between 

the adjusting member (22) or catch ring (62) and the 
second valve-closing member (25). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the catch device (60) is formed by a radially 

outward-projecting catch ring (62) connected to the 
adjusting member (22) and by an inward-pointing projection 

(61) connected to the second valve-closing member 
(52) and reaching behind the catch ring (62), the catch 

ring (62) and the projection (61) being at a predetermined 
axial distance from one another in the closed 

position of the first valve-closing member (42). 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the second valve-closing member (52) is acted upon 

in the valve-closing direction by the force of a spring 
(54). 
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in 
that the spring (54) is supported between the second 

valve-closing member (52) and the adjusting member (22). 
Device according to Claim 6, characterized in 
that the spring (54) acting on the second valve-closing 

member (52) has a higher preloading force than a spring 
(28) acting on the adjusting member (22), and the actuating 

drive acts from both sides. 
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in 
that the adjusting member (22) is mounted so as to be 

axially displaceable on a bearing pin (21) connected to  
 

the actuating drive (11).
