<ABSTRACT>
A cylinder lock-key combination, which comprises a lock 
body (5) having a lock cylinder (6) which is arranged to 

control a bolt element (4) connected thereto and which 
encloses a set of locking discs (7) provided with peripheral 

notches (13) determining the opening combination, is divided 
in the longitudinal direction of the lock into two separate 

locking bar elements (9; 10) which together with the locking 
discs (7) cooperating therewith are arranged to form two 

locking units functionally independent of each other and the 
opening directions of which are opposite one with respect to 

the other. Transversal extensions (12a; 12b) of a groove (12) 
in the lock body (5) extend in the opposite direction with 

regard to the opening direction of the locking unit located 
at the position thereof thereby allowing movement of the 

locking bar element (9; 10) in question in said opposite 
direction without opening the locking unit not to be unlocked. 

Hence, the cylinder lock can be operated in opposite turning 
directions by means of two separate keys having quite 

independent combination cuts.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a cylinder lock - key
combination in accordance with the preamble of claim 1 and a
locking system utilising the combination.GB-A-1265023 shows a cylinder lock of the above-mentioned
kind which can be operated in opposite turning directions by
means of two separate keys. This kind of known lock can be
employed to lock, for example, two adjacent safety-deposit
boxes, access doors or the like, each of the keys being
intended to open only a respective one of the boxes or doors
in question.In this known solution, the combination cuts of the two
keys are located on opposite sides of the axis of symmetry of
the keys, respectively. In addition the cuts of the keys are
mirror-like so that a so-called O-cut in one key corresponds
to a so-called 5-cut in the other key, a 1-cut corresponds to
a 4-cut, a 3-cut corresponds to a 2-cut, a 2-cut corresponds
to a 3-cut, and so on. Thus when the combination of one of
the pair of keys is known, the correct combination for the key
capable of operating in the other direction can easily be
deduced which constitutes a potential security risk.On the other hand, both keys of the pair act on the same
set of locking discs. Following an opening of the locking
mechanism using one of the keys, the bolt element attached to
the lock cylinder can be turned back beyond the normal lock-closed
position all the way into the opening position of the
bolt element which should only be possible with the other key
of the pair. This is possible because once the set of locking
discs have been arranged in the relative positions to open the
locking mechanism they can be retained in these positions by
turning them using the bolt element. Thus the security for
safe locking of this known cylinder lock-key combination is
defective. One aim of the invention is to provide an improved
cylinder lock-key combination which is operable in both
turning directions by means of two separate keys but from
which the above referred to defects have been eliminazed.This aim of the invention can be met by means of a
combination according to claim 1. In this way
it is possible to operate the lock in two different turning
directions by means of two keys formed so that the combination
cuts of the keys are independent one of the other. Thus
knowing the combination of one of the keys of a pair does not
permit a deduction to be made as to the combination of the
other key of the pair. With a combination according to the
invention it is not possible to manipulate the bolt element
and the lock cylinder in
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A cylinder lock-key combination, which comprises a
lock body (5) having a lock cylinder (6) which is arranged to

turn a bolt element (4) connected thereto and which cylinder
(6) encloses a set of locking discs (7) provided with

peripheral notches (13) located within a cutting range
extending on both sides of an axis of symmetry (A) of each,

locking disc (7) and determining the opening combination of
the lock, and a locking bar (9; 10) which in a locked position

thereof is located partly in a groove (12) provided in the
inner surface of the lock body (5) and partly in a slot (17)

provided in the lock cylinder (6) to prevent turning of the
lock cylinder (6) with respect to the lock body (5), the

locking discs (7) being separately turned by means of the key
of the combination into positions in which the peripheral

notches (13) thereof are aligned at the position of the
locking bar (9; 10) to form a channel into which the locking

bar (9; 10) enters thereby releasing the lock cylinder (6) to
turn with respect to the lock body (5), 
characterised in that

the locking bar (9; 10) is divided in the longitudinal
direction of the lock into two separate locking bar elements

(9; 10) which together with the set of locking discs (7)
cooperating therewith define two locking units functionally

independent one of the other and the opening directions of
which are opposite with respect to o
ne another, and in that
said groove (12) located in the lock body (5) for the locking

bar comprises a transversal extension (12a; 12b) for each
of the locking bar elements (9; 10) so that each extension

(12a; 12b) extends in the opposite direction with regard to
the opening direction of the locking unit located at the

respective position thereof, thereby allowing movement of the
respective locking bar element (9; 10) in said opposite

direction without opening the locking unit
not being turned in its opening direction.
A combination according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
 a separating disc (11), which is fixed relative to the
lock cylinder (6), is arranged between said two locking units,

said separating disc (11) being equipped with a projection
(lla) separating the locking bar elements (9; 10) one from

the other.
A combination according to either of the preceding
claims, 
characterised in that
 the axial length of one locking
bar element (9) and of the locking unit corresponding thereto,

is different from the axial length of the other locking bar
element (10) and its locking unit.
A combination according to any one preceding claim,

characterised in that
 each transverse extension (12a; 12b)
of the groove (12) in the lock body (5) extends in the

direction of the turning movement of the lock cylinder (6) a
distance which corresponds to the opening movement of said

bolt element (4) connected to the lock cylinder (6).
A combination according to any one
preceding claim, 
characterised in that
 it comprises
at least one key having combination cuts (18a; 19a) for a locking unit corresponding

only to one of the locking bar elements (9; 10) and in that
the location of the combination cuts (18a, 19a) with regard

to the axis of symmetry (B) of the key is chosen according to
the opening direction of the locking unit required in each

case.
A locking system for locking
openable doors (1; 2) for two adjacent safety-deposit boxes,

cupboards or the like, including as locking means a combination in
accordance with any of the preceding claims and comprising a separate key (18; 19)

for each locking unit of the cylinder lock (3) of the
combination, 
characterised in that
 a bolt element (4) is
connected to the cylinder lock (3), said bolt

element (4), in one position, being arranged to lock both the
doors (1, 2), whereby either one of the locking units can be

opened with its respective key and said bolt element (4) be 
turned into a position, in which the respective one of the

doors can be opened but not the other door.
