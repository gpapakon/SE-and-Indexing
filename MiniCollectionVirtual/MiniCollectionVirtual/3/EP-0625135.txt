A continuous process for the purification of glycerol water of 
oleochemical origin, more particularly glycerol water (sweet water) 

accumulating in the high-pressure hydrolysis of natural fats and oils with 
steam into fatty acid and glycerol, characterized in that fatty compounds 

larger than 100 µm in diameter are removed from the aqueous phase by 
means of a plate-type phase separator and are returned to the high-pressure 

hydrolysis process, the aqueous phase thus prepurified is passed through a 

crossflow filtration membrane and the concentrate is returned to the entrance 
of the plate-type phase separator. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the filtration 
membrane is a microfiltration membrane. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, characterized in that the filtration 
membrane is periodically cleaned by backwashing with alkali hydroxide. 
A process as claimed in claim 3, characterized in that the used 
backwashing liquid is collected in a vessel, the membrane is rinsed with acid 

after backwashing, the rinsing liquid is also collected in the vessel so that the 
soaps formed therein are hydrolyzed and, finally, the contents of the vessel 

are returned to the entrance of the plate-type phase separator. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, characterized in that the 
flow of permeate through the membrane is kept constant by changing the 

transmembranal pressure. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, characterized in that backwashing 
begins when a predetermined transmembranal pressure is exceeded. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 6, characterized in that a 
back-washable membrane, more especially a ceramic membrane, preferably 

of graphite or Al

O

, having a pore diameter of 0.5 to 2 µm is used. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, characterized in that the 
aqueous phase prepurified in the plate-type phase separator is passed 

through a fibre bed separator, the light phase obtained is returned to the high  
 

pressure hydrolysis process and the heavy phase is fed to the membrane 
filtration stage of which the concentrate is delivered to the entrance of the 

fibre bed separator. 
A process as claimed in claim 8, characterized in that the pressure loss 
through the fibre bed separator is kept constant by continuous adjustment of 

the temperature of the inflowing glycerol water. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 9, characterized in that the 
filtration membrane is preceded by an adsorption unit.
