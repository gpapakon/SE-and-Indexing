<ABSTRACT>
In a transmission system for transmitting speech and musical signals, an 
input signal is split up into two spectral portions in a coder (4). These spectral portions 

are coded each by its own sub-coder. In a first sub-coder (64) the envelope of a 
transmit signal is determined and this envelope is compared with a number of reference 

envelopes. An identification code of the reference envelope that corresponds most to the 
current envelope is transmitted to a receiver (6). Based upon the identification code, a 

reconstructed signal is generated in a decoder (72) present in the receiver (6), which 
signal has an envelope that corresponds to the reference envelope.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a transmission system comprising a transmitter 
which has a coder for deriving a digitally coded signal from a transmit signal, the 
transmitter comprising transmitting means for transmitting the coded signal by a channel 
to a receiver, which receiver comprises a decoder for forming a reconstructed signal 
from the coded signal. The invention likewise relates to a transmitter, a receiver, a coder and a 
decoder to be used in such a system. A transmission system as defined in the opening paragraph is known from 
the journal article "Bit Rates in Audio Source Coding" by R.N.J. Veldhuis in IEEE 
Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Vol. 10, No. 1, January 1992. Transmission systems of this type are used for digitally transmitting an 
analog signal by a digital transmission channel or for recording and reproducing such a 
signal by a magnetic or optical storage medium. For transmission or recording 
purposes, the analog signal is to be converted to a digital signal. It appears that the 
conversion of an analog signal to a digital signal having sufficient resolution by a 
digitizer, without further measures being taken, often results in a digital signal that 
needs an impermissibly high transmission rate. Several coders are known for reducing 
this transmission rate. In a first type of transmission system the relation between successive 
signal samples of the digitized analog signal is determined in the coder by means of 
linear prediction and a signal to be coded is derived from the digitized analog signal by 
an analysis filter. This transmit signal also referenced residual signal is a measure for a 
component of a signal sample that cannot be predicted on the basis of preceding signal 
samples. The relation between successive signal samples is characterized by so-termed 
prediction parameters. The transmit signal is coded and the transmitter transmits same 
together with the prediction parameters in the form of a digitally coded signal to the 
receiver through the channel. As the transmit signal is formed only by unpredictable 
components of the input signal, the transmit signal has a much lower amplitude than the  
 
input signal. As a result, this signal can be coded with much fewer digital symbols. In the decoder a reconstructed signal is derived from the digitally coded 
signal. A synthesis filter having a transfer function which is inverse to the transfer 
function of the analysis filter derives from the reconstructed signal a reconstructed input 
signal which is a
