<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a process for the production of environmentally acceptable decorative labels which can be produced without using a PVC film. The process comprises applying a heat-transferable embossing film to a substrate comprising a release paper, an adhesive layer and a plastic film comprising homopolymers or copolymers of ethylene having a crystallite melting point (DIN 53765) of from 110 to 120@C, an enthalpy of fusion (DIN 53765) of from 125 to 100 J/g and a melt flow index (DIN 53735) of from 2.0 to 3.5 g/10 min. The embossing film contains a hot-melt adhesive layer which is activatable at from 110 to 230@C. The embossing operation is carried out at a temperature of from 110 to 230@C, a pressure of from 1.0 to 7.0 bar and for a time from 3 to 0.3 s.

a) applying a heat-transferable embossing foil which
contains a support layer, a release layer, one or

more decorative layers and a hot melt adhesive
layer, to a substrate including a release paper, an

adhesive layer and a plastic film, in such a way
that the hot melt adhesive layer of the embossing

foil and the plastic film of the substrate are
opposite;
b) embossing the above combination of embossing foil
and substrate with a heated stamp whose stamp

surface bears a given motif and comprises raised
edges relative to the interior of the stamp surface

and acts on the support layer of the embossing foil,
so that in the region of the stamp surface the

embossing foil and substrate are joined together by
the hot melt adhesive layer, and the release layer,

decorative layer(s) and hot melt adhesive layer of
the embossing foil as well as the plastic film and

adhesive layer of the substrate are melted through
and punched through in the region of the raised

edges;
c) pulling the support layer of the embossing foil and
the portions of the embossing foil which are not

joined to the substrate, off the substrate; and
d) pulling off the portions of the plastic film and
adhesive layer of the substrate which are located

outside the periphery of the stamp motif (stamp
surface);

characterised in that homopolymers or copolymers of
ethylene with a crystallite melting point (DIN 53765) of

110 to 120°C, a fusion heat (DIN 53765) of 125 to 180 J/g
and a melt-flow index (DIN 53735) of 2.0 to 3.5 g/10 min

are used in the substrate as the plastic film, a hot melt
adhesive layer which can be heat-activated in the range 

from 110 to 230°C is selected in the embossing foil, and
the embossing process is carried out at a temperature of

110 to 230°C and pressure of 1.0 to 7.0 bar and for a
time of 3 to 0.3 s.
Method according to claim 1, characterised in that the
plastic film in the substrate is made of low-density

polyethylene (LDPE).
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the surface of the plastic film in the substrate is

provided on one or both sides with a bonding agent
(primer).
Method according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in
that the surface of the plastic film in the substrate is

pretreated by a corona or plasma discharge.
Method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the release paper in the substrate

is a silicone paper.
Method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the support layer in the embossing

foil is formed from a polyester film.
Method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that the decorative layer(s) in the

embossing foil include(s) (an) unpigmented transparent
lacquer layer(s), (a) pigmented lacquer layer(s) and/or

(a) metal layer(s).
Method according to claim 7, characterised in that in
the embossing foil is provided a pigmented lacquer layer

or a metal layer on the side opposite the hot melt
adhesive layer and an unpigmented lacquer layer on the

side opposite the release layer. 
Method according to any of the preceding claims,
characterised in that in step b) first embossing foil and

substrate are joined by the hot melt adhesive layer over
the whole surface area at a temperature of 110 to 200°C

and pressure of 1.0 to 5.5 bar and for a time of 1 to

0.01 s, before embossing the combination of embossing
foil and substrate with a heated stamp whose stamp

surface bears a given motif and comprises raised edges
relative to the interior of the stamp surface and acts on

the support layer of the embossing foil, so that in the
region of the stamp surface the release layer, decorative

layer(s) and hot melt adhesive layer of the embossing
foil as well as the plastic film and adhesive layer of

the substrate are melted through and punched through in
the region of the raised edges,

in step c) the support layer of the embossing foil is
pulled off, and

in step d) the portions of the embossing foil, the
plastic film and the adhesive layer of the substrate

which are located outside the periphery of the stamp
motif (stamp surface) are pulled off.
Method according to claim 9, characterised in that in
step b) after joining embossing foil and substrate over

the whole surface area the support layer of the applied
embossing foil is pulled off, and a second embossing foil

lines which are located within the contour pattern of the
first stamp, but less raised than the edges of the first

stamp, so that in the region of the inner contour lines
(stamp surface) the first and third embossing foils are

embossing foils and the plastic film and adhesive layer
of the substrate being melted through and punched

through, and then the portions of the third embossing
