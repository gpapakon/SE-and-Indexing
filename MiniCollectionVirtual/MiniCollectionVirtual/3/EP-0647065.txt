<ABSTRACT>
A television vertical timebase circuit includes an arrangement (10, 25, 30, 35, 
40, 45) for generating a vertical ramp voltage of first and second slopes 

corresponding to 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios. An arrangement (50,55,65) adds 
a predetermined voltage to a predetermined portion of the 16:9 ratio ramp 

voltage such that unwanted visible signals are positioned outside the visible 
screen area when displaying 16:9 aspect ratio pictures.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to television vertical timebase circuits.Conventionally, a television set has a screen with a particular aspect (width
to height) ratio. This ratio is 4:3 for most televisions.Some television signals have different aspect ratios, such as a D2-MAC
broadcast via satellite, which has an aspect ratio of 16:9. By reducing the
picture height by 25% (using only 75% of the entire screen height), a 16:9
aspect signal may be completely reproduced on a 4:3 aspect screen, with a
12.5% void area above and below the picture, see eg GB-A-2 186 165.A television set which has the drive and/or cut off levels of its picture tube
automatically adjusted, does this by inserting sampling pulses into some
lines of the television signal where there is no useful picture information
(sampling lines). A cathode current resulting from the sampling lines is
measured, and the drive and cut off levels are adjusted such that the cathode
current achieves a desired level. When displaying a 4:3 signal on a 4:3
screen, the sampling lines are above the topmost visible part of the screen,
hence the lines are out of view.A problem with this arrangement is that in the case of a 16:9 signal being
viewed on a 4:3 screen, such sampling lines appear in the void area, causing
disturbance to a person viewing the television screen.Prior art documents GB-A-2 262 407, GB-A-2 254 977 and
WO-A-91/07051 disclose, as solutions to the aforementioned
problem, effectively blanking the video signal supplied to the
CRT, or replacing it with a signal carrying desired information,
when the void area is scanned.This invention seeks to provide a vertical timebase circuit in which the above
mentioned disadvantage has been mitigated. The present invention is as defined in the appended claims.It is an object of the present invention to provide a television vertical
timebase circuit comprising means for generating a vertical ramp voltage of
first and second slopes corresponding to respective first and second picture
aspect ratios in which the second aspect ratio has a smaller picture height
than the first and means for adding a predetermined voltage to a
predetermined portion of the second ramp voltage to adjust the starting
position on the screen of pictures of the second aspect ratio, and means for
inhibiting adding the predetermined voltage during the occurrence of
unwanted visible signals whereby said unwanted visible signals are
positioned outside the visible screen area when displaying pictures of the
second aspect ratio.The circuit may
