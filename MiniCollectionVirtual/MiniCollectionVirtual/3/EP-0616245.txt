<ABSTRACT>
A photographic film cartridge (30) has a word imprinted 
on the exterior surface of the cartridge visually 

indicating exposure status of film in the cartridge. A 
thermally responsive coating of a phase change medium 

overlies a portion of the word such that when the 
medium is rendered opaque, the word is changed 

to indicate that the film is in an exposed state. The 
camera is provided with a heat generating element (26) that 

is activated when images are exposed onto the film to 
render the phase change medium opaque. The camera is 

also provided with an opto-sensor (42) and control means (46) 
responsive to the phase change medium to allow loading 

of the film when the medium is in its unchanged 
condition and to prevent loading of the film when the 

phase change medium is changed to indicate exposed film 
in the cartridge.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to the field of 
photographic film cameras and film cartridges therefor 
with provision for double exposure prevention. Conventional 35mm film cartridges are normally 
sold with a portion of the film leader projecting from 
the exit slot of the cartridge. This allows the camera 
user to grasp and pull the film for loading in the 
camera and at the same time provides a visual 
indication to the camera user that the film in the 
cartridge is unexposed. Upon rewind, the film is 
rewound completely into the cartridge and the absence 
of the protruding leader indicates that the film has 
been exposed and prevents reuse of the film in a camera 
thus inherently providing protection against double 
exposure of the film. Recently, camera and film 
cartridge designs have been proposed in which the film 
is totally enclosed in the cartridge when sold. To 
load the film, the cartridge is inserted and the drive 
motor operates to thrust the film out of the cartridge 
to the film take-up spool. Upon rewind, the film is 
drawn entirely into the cartridge. As a consequence, 
there is no visual indication to distinguish between an 
exposed and an unexposed film roll and, thus, numerous 
camera and cartridge designs have been proposed to 
provide protection against re-use and double exposure 
of the film. It is known, for example, to provide cartridges 
with mechanical features that cooperate with feelers in  
 
the camera that prevent insertion of cartridges into 
the camera when the film has previously been exposed. 
In many cases these mechanical features also provide a 
visual indication of the exposed condition of the film. 
A representative example of an arrangement providing 
both visible indication and mechanical lockout means is 
found in commonly assigned U.S. Patent 5,047,794. U.S. 
Patent 5,115,268 discloses a mechanical slide on the 
film cartridge is movable by a cam arrangement upon 
insertion into the camera to cover the letters UN in 
the word UNEXPOSED printed on the end of the cartridge 
to provide a visible indication of an exposed condition 
of the film in the cartridge. In commonly assigned 
U.S. Patent 5,032,854 and 5,030,978, a radial bar coded 
disc on the end of a film cartridge is sensed by an 
opto-sensor in the camera to position the film spool 
upon conclusion of rewind at a selected one of plural 
visual indicators that indicate the exposure condition 
of film in the camera. Such arrangements however, require special 
cartridge designs that add to the cost and

Double exposure prevention apparatus for a 
photographic camera comprising: 

   a heat generating element so positioned in the 
camera as to be in heat transfer relationship with a 

thermally responsive phase change medium in a 
predetermined region on the surface of a film cartridge 

placed in the camera; and 
   control means for activating the heat generating 

element when at least one image frame has been exposed 
on film from said cartridge to create an indicium on 

said phase change medium to visually indicate said film 
in the cartridge has been exposed. 
The invention of claims 1 wherein said 
control means is effective to activate said heat 

generating element after all image frames have been 
exposed. 
The invention of claim 1 further including an 
opto-sensor so positioned in the camera as to detect 

the existence of said indicium in said phase change 
medium region. 
The invention of claim 3 wherein said control 
means if further responsive to detection of said 

indicium to prevent loading of said film into the 
camera. 
A photographic film camera comprising: 
   a chamber for receiving a film cartridge having a 

thermally responsive phase change medium in a 
predetermined region on the cartridge surface; 

   a heat generating element so positioned in the 
 

cartridge receiving chamber as to be in thermal contact 
with said region of the phase change medium when said 

cartridge is inserted into the chamber; 
   an opto-sensor so positioned in the cartridge 

receiving chamber as to be responsive to reflectivity 
of said region of phase change medium on the cartridge; 

and 
   control means responsive to exposure of at least 

one image frame on film from said cartridge to activate 
said heat generator to create an indicium within said 

region representing an exposed film condition and 
responsive to said opto-sensor for preventing loading 

of film into the camera when said indicium is sensed by 
said opto-sensor on a cartridge inserted into said 

cartridge receiving chamber. 
The invention of claim 3 or 5 in which said 
cartridge bears alpha-characters adapted to visually 

indicate an unexposed condition of film in the 
cartridge and wherein said heat generating element is 

adapted, upon activation, to modify at least some of 
said alpha-characters with said indicium after exposure 

of film in the camera to indicate an exposed condition 
of the film in the cartridge. 
The invention of claim 6 said region of phase 
change material is superimposed over said at least some 

alpha-characters and wherein said heat generating 
element is adapted to render said region of phase 

change material opaque whereby said at least some 
alpha-numeric characters are obliterated to change the 

meaning of said alpha-characters from that representing 
an unexposed to an exposed condition of film in the 

cartridge. 
A photographic film cartridge having a 
 

housing with an outer surface and comprising: 
   a coating of a thermally responsive phase change 

medium in a predetermined region on the outer surface 
of the film cartridge whereby activation of the phase 

change medium creates an indicium representing an 
exp
osed condition of film in the cartridge. 
The cartridge of claim 8 further comprising a 
set of alpha characters on the outer surface providing 

visual indication representative of an unexposed 
condition of said film and wherein said region of phase 

change material overlies at least a portion of said 
alpha characters whereby activation of said phase 

change material obliterates said portion of alpha 
characters leaving a visual indication representative 

of an exposed condition of said film.
