<ABSTRACT>
The process involves blowing in the drying air so as to make it flow only through perforations (10
<

) of brick blocks (10) without substantially affecting the outer lateral surfaces of the blocks themselves. This process is carried out through drying tunnel (1) divided into two sides (21, 31) by the blocks stacked on a row of consecutive mobile trolleys (8) and by vertical diaphragms (9), sides (21, 31) between which the air is maintained in circulation by a series of fans (6), and of which one side (31) receives from opposite perforations (2a) the heated air which comes from conduit (2) parallel and alongside the tunnel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to the field of drying perforated brick blocks 
inside drying tunnels into which air pre-heated to a pre-determined 
temperature is blown. The main drawbacks exhibited by drying plants that use processes already 
known are twofold: the high energy consumption required by the process 
and the risk of deformations or cracks present on the finished product. Both these drawbacks are caused by the modalities of the process that is 
carried out, as well as by the morphology of the plants itself. Presently, in fact, the drying of perforated brick blocks takes place 
through a process that involves the stacking of individual layers of 
blocks on levels of special metal shelving inside a tunnel or, more 
commonly, a room of significant size in which two heating and 
ventilating units, either stationary or mobile, operate and direct 
streams of air onto the blocks to obtain their drying. No matter how accurate the study of the reciprocal arrangement of the 
shelves and fans may be, still the drawback is observed that the brick 
blocks that are located in different positions undergo drying processes 
whose temperature and humidity parameters, in the course of the 
operation, end up being significantly different from one another, with 
the resulting differentiation in the quality of the blocks themselves. In fact, since the drying essentially takes place through the dynamic 
action of the airflows pushed by the fans onto the shelving and the 
blocks, naturally phenomena of turbulence and choking of the stream on 
areas "in shadow" are observed that can cause uneven contractions in 
different blocks, or even of different faces of the same block, and very 
often surface cracks and aberrations in the planarity of the outer 
surfaces of the blocks.  
 These phenomena are also due to the fact that in the course of the 
process described, the drying essentially takes place starting from the 
outer surfaces of the blocks and proceeding toward the inside; moreover, 
as already explained, with uneven temperature and humidity gradients in 
the various parts of the same block. Thus this effects the quality of 
the final product; as to energy consumption, on the other hand, 
supposing a yield coefficient is established to indicate the 
relationship with the quantity (mass) of product dried and the quantity 
of thermal and electric energy employed in the process that have been 
used up to now, very low values are obtained that are due to the 
following concomitant factors: 
a high quantity of mechanical

Process for the drying of perforated brick blocks (10) through the 
action of air at a pre-determined temperature that is blown into a drying 

tunnel (1) in which the blocks are placed on mobile trolleys (8), the 

drying being obtained 
by causing the air to flow only through perforations 

(10
i
) of blocks (10), without substantially affecting the outer lateral 
surfaces of the blocks themselves that are stacked on one another and 

laid sideways to one another, characterized in that
 
   the following phases are 

included: 

a) stacking on the mobile trolleys (8) a number of perforated blocks (10) 
placed on top of one another, laid sideways and lengthwise and aligned, 

with the longitudinal axes of the perforations (10
i
) arranged 
horizontally, with said axes of two perforations corresponding to two 

adjacent blocks laid next to one another arranged so that each is the 
extension of the other; 
b) introduction of the trolleys (8) into the drying tunnel (1); 
c) conveyance of said mobile trolleys (8) perpendicular to the direction 
of the above mentioned perforations (10
i
), along an essentially median 
axis of the drying tunnel (1) equipped with diaphragm (9), so as to divide 

with the trolleys and the diaphragm the tunnel (1) into two opposite sides 
(21, 31) separated by the stacked blocks and communicating with one 

another essentially only through all the perforations (10
i
) of the 
blocks themselves; 
d) introduction of the heated drying air into one (21) of the two 
opposite sides of the tunnel (1) and a resulting pressure that differs to a 

pre-determined extent from the pressure prevailing in the other side 
(31), so that the entire flow of the above mentioned drying air passes 

through all the perforations (10
i
) of the blocks to circulate through 
both of the above mentioned sides (21, 31) of the tunnel (1);  

 
e) cooling of blocks (10) once drying has taken place, with recovery of 
the relative heat from cooling; 
f) extraction of the mobile trolleys (8) from the tunnel (1). 
Drying plant suitable for realizing the process according to 
claim 1, wherein it 

includes: 

a) a drying tunnel (1) equipped at its ends (1a, 1b) with an entrance 
opening and an exit opening that are sized so as to allow for the 

passage of mobile trolleys (8) carrying stacked blocks (10) without 
substantial leaks of pressured air; 
b) a conduit (2) parallel to the tunnel (1), adjacent to it over its entire 
length and equipped with a number of perforations (2a) placed at equal 

distances which make it communicate with one (21) of the two sides (21, 
31) of the tunnel (1) itself; 
c) a main ventilation and heating unit (3) located near the exit (1a) of 
the tunnel (1), which delivers the drying air, at pre-determined pressures 

and temperatures, in said conduit (2); 
d) a cooling unit (5) located near the exit (1a) of the tunnel (1), on the 
opposite side from the so-called main unit (3), comprising a compressing 

fan that delivers a stream of air on the stacked blocks (10) that have been 
dried, cooling them, then directing it toward the inside of the tunnel (1) 

so as to recover the heat from cooling; 
e) an evacuation unit (4), comprised of a suction fan located near the entrance 
(1b) of the tunnel (1); 
f) a number of circulating fans (6) placed at equal distances and 
mounted roughly on the center line of the ceiling (1c) of the tunnel (1) over 

the entire length of the tunnel itself that maintain a pre-determined  
 

difference in pressure between its two sides (21, 31); 
g) a guide path (7) that can be embedded in the floor (1d) of the tunnel (1), 
arranged essentially along its middle line, having a shape suitable for 

holding and guiding during their conveyance mobile trolleys (8) that 
transport the blocks (10) to be dried; 
h) a number of consecutive mobile trolleys (8) mounted on wheels, 
connected to one another, on which the blocks (10) to be dried are 

stacked; 
i) a vertical diaphragm (9), essentially mounted in correspondence to the 
center line of ceiling (1c) of tunnel (1) and equipped with members (9a) 

suitable for creating sufficient pressure on the blocks stacked below 
(10) to create a seal that substantially prevents the passage of air 

from one side (21) of the tunnel to the other (31) through the diaphragm (9) 
itself. 
Plant according to claim 2, wherein said mobile trolleys (8), as well 
as the respective diaphragms (9), are aligned to form two parallel rows, 

subdividing the tunnel (1) into three parts, with circulating fans (11) 
mounted on the center line of the ceiling (1c) and equipped with conveyors 

(11a, 11b) suitable for putting in communication the two sides (21, 31) of 
the tunnel (1) that are separated by a row of trolleys, and said conduit (2) 

for the drying air, with the respective outflow perforations (2a), made 
below the floor (1a) of the tunnel (1) in a position essentially facing the line 

formed by the above mentioned circulating fans (11). 
Plant according to claim 3, wherein several tunnels (1) are placed 
parallel to one another, without any dividing wall to separate them from 

one another, thus forming a multiple tunnel (101) suitable for higher 
production speeds.
