<ABSTRACT>
A card terminal for settling transactions with a 
prepaid card or a credit card comprising a card reader 

for reading data out of the card, a data writer for 
writing data on the card, a display for indicating the 

customer's data, transaction data, and stamp points, and 
a keyboard for inputting sales da
ta, customer's data, 
or stamp point data. This card terminal has at least 

one of the functions from among inquiring about the 
transaction, cancellation of the transaction, purchase 

of commodities, calculation of the service points in 
accordance with an amount of transaction, display of the 

personal anniversary of the customer, and writing the 
details of a transaction, the service points, or 

personal data, even if the card is prepaid card or a 
credit card. The service point can be increased in 

accordance with the convenience of the stores, such as a 
bonus sales and customer's anniversary, by setting a 

multiple at the card terminal. These multiple functions 
are automatically and systematically achieved, to 

realize improved service and quick efficient business.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for
settling transactions with a card such as, for example
but not necessarily, a credit card, a prepaid card, or
a service point card that provides various services,
and effectively uses the functions of the card.Recently, various kinds of prepaid or credit
cards, having magnetic stripes have been used in a
variety of ways. These cards have been issued by
department stores or large shops themselves or in
cooperation with credit companies, by chain or group
speciality shops, by small shops, or by shop
associations.Apparatuses for settling transactions with such a
variety of cards are required to have not only a
function of handling the cards but also additional
service functions to provide more services for card
users, promote the use of the cards, and extend the
usage of the cards in different fields.For example, instead of a conventional stamping
service on the stamp sheet as a coupon or a reward for
cash transactions, service points will be recorded in
the magnetic stripe according to the amount of payment
or the number of transactions. When the points reach a
predetermined number, the customer may receive a bonus.
Special points will be granted to customers on their
special days such as birthdays or wedding
anniversaries.EP-A-0253240 discloses how service points
can be added to a magnetic strip of a special
service card separate from a payment card such as a
credit card, while US-A-5,200,889 discloses how
a customer's birthday can be indicated from a central file.To provide apparatus with such functions,
necessary data must be stored in individual cards. As
the amount of data to be stored in the cards increases,
the apparatuses become more complicated. It is
therefore required in order to automatically and
systematically carry out the functions to make the
apparatuses simpler and more efficient. Conventional apparatuses for settling transactions
with a card, having a plurality of functions require
different operations function by function. Namely, the
conventional apparatuses require complicated operations
and are inefficient.For example, transactions with cards always
involve cancellations and enquiries. The conventional
apparatuses may settle a transaction with a card but
they never record the details of the transaction in the
card.When a customer asks to return or exchange a
purchased commodity due to a mistake in the kind or
size of the commodity, a seller must check the
commodity and a receipt brought by the customer and
manually correct the amount
