<ABSTRACT>
The present invention relates to a method for the separation of triglyceride containing edible oils into fractions that are enriched in polyunsaturated triglycerides and fractions that are enriched in saturated triglycerides. The invention is particularly applicable to the separation of triglyceride containing oils derived from fish. The method comprises (a) solidifying the edible oil by use of low temperature and (b) extracting the solidified edible oil with a polar organic solvent at a temperature of -50  DEG C or below; wherein the extract comprises the polyunsaturated enriched oil and the residue comprise the saturated triglyceride enriched solidified oil. The solidification step is preferably carried out by mixing the oil with liquid nitrogen and the extraction step is preferably carried out with acetone.

<DESCRIPTION>
 TRIGLYCERIDE ENRICHMENT.The present invention relates to a method for the separation of triglyceride containing oils, particularly edible oils, into fractions that are enriched in polyunsaturated triglycerides and fractions that are enriched in saturated triglycerides, and to apparatus for carrying it out. This invention is particularly applicable to the separation of triglyceride containing oils derived from fish.The triglyceride (TG) composition of fish oils is diverse. This is in part a consequence of their wide ranging fatty acid composition which incorporates short chain saturated acids such as tetradecanoic acid and the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) cis-5»8,11,14, 17-eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and cis-4,7.10,13.l6,19-docosahexanoic acid (DHA) . The composition of virtually all fish oils can be described by reference to eight major fatty acids (see Gunstone et al; The Lipid Handbook, Chapman and Hall, 1986, p. 130); these being 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:1, 20:1, 22:1, 20:5 (n-3) and 22:6 (n-3) . An additional thirteen acids are often present above a level of 0.3# and include 15:0, 16:2, 16:3. 16:4, 18:0, 18:2, 18:3 (n-3). 18:4 (n-3), 20:0, 20:4 (n-6 and n-3) , 21:5 and 22:5 (n-3) . Furthermore, trace quantities of the odd numbered fatty acids 17:0 and 17-1 are often detected (Ackman R G; Advances in Fish Science and Technology edited by J.J. Connell, Fishing News Books Ltd, England, 9δ0, pp 86-103), while methyl-branch fatty acids are also present as minor components (Ratnayake, W.M.N. , B. Olsson and R.G. Ackman, Lipids 24:630 (I989)).The triglyceride distribution of fish oils has been studied by Ag+-HPLC (Laakso et al, Lipids (1989) 2 : p630 ) and reverse phase chromatography (Laakso and Christie, J. Am. Oil. Chem. Soc.(1991) 68: 213), whereby it has been shown that they contain triglycerides with only saturated fatty acid moieties present in the molecule and those where each fatty acid contains at least five double bonds with a wide range of variation of fish oil triglyceride composition. 

The increased interest in both the fatty acid composition and triglyceride distribution of fish oils is a direct result of the association of high fish containing diets and the consumption of fish oils with the prevention and treatment of a variety of human diseases. The influences of the n-3 acids EPA and DHA, which are regarded as being the nutritionally important components of the fish oils, have been observed in relation to beneficial effects upon occurrence of cardiovascular disease,

CLAIMS
1. A method for separating an oil comprising triglycerides into polyunsaturated triglyceride enriched and saturated triglyceride enriched oil fractions comprising:
(a) solidifying the oil by freezing to form discrete bodies; (b) extracting the solidified oil bodies with a polar organic solvent at a temperature of -30°C or below, for at least 1 hour; (c) separating the solution obtained from the residue of the bodies; and (d) removing the solvent from the solution to leave enriched extract oil; wherein the extract oil comprises the polyunsaturate enriched oil and the residue comprise the saturated triglyceride enriched oil.
2. A method as claimed in claim 1 wherein the period is at least 5 hours.
3. A method as claimed in claim 2 wherein the period is from between 24 to 72 hours.
4. A method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3 wherein the solidification step (a) is rapid wherein crystallisation of the oil substantially does not take place.
