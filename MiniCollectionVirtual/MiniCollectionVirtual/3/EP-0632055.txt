<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a novel anticoagulant
substance obtained from human urine, a process for its
preparation and a pharmaceutical composition comprising
the said substance for prevention and/or treatment
of diseases related to the disorders in blood coagulation
system.As anticoagulant agents, heparin and antithrombin
III are presently in use. Thrombolytic agents in use
include urokinase, which is obtained from human urine
or from cultured kidney cells, and streptokinase,
which is extracted from beta-hemolytic streptococci.
In addition, tissue plasminogen activator is now being
developed.On the other hand, it is well known that these
drugs have side effects such as tendency of bleeding,
and their anticoagulant or thrombolytic effect are not
sufficient for the clinical use. In the field of fundamental
investigation, an unknown substance was
recently purified from rabbit lung extract and was
identified as a novel physiological anticoagulant.
The substance was named thrombomodulin [N. L. Esmon
et al., J. Biol. Chem., Vol. 257, p.859 (1982)].
Thrombomodulin has two modes of action; an anticoagulant 
activity based on its anti-thrombin effect,
and a fibrinolytic effect based on its stimulatory
effect on thrombin-catalyzed protein C activation.
Thrombomodulin is a receptor of thrombin on endothelial
cell surface, and, by binding thrombin, directly
inhibits its procoagulant activity. Moreover,
thrombin-thrombomodulin complex activates protein C
which possesses a potent anticoagulant effect and a
thrombolytic effect [I. Maruyama et al., J. Clin.
Invest., Vol. 75, p.987 (1985)]. Since thrombomodulin
exhibits not only an anticoagulant activity but also
an enhancing effect on thrombolytic system, it is
expected to be very useful for the treatment of blood
coagulation disorders.Since the thrombomodulin molecule mainly consists
of peptides, thrombomodulin derived from human, which
has little antigenicity, ought to be administered to
patients in order to avoid side effects such as anaphylactic
shock. In regard to the isolation of human-derived
thrombomodulins, there are some reports as
described below. In following explanation, molecular
weights of the human-derived thrombomodulins, if no
excuse, are the results of measurements by sodium
dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) under non-reduced condition. P. W. Majerus et al. purified thrombomodulin from
human placenta and reported its molecular weight as
75,000 [J. Biol Chem., Vol 259, p.12246 (1984)]. I.
Maruyama et al. isolated
