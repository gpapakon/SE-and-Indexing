<ABSTRACT>
A prize awarding system (1) wherein a number of 
terminals (10) (e.g. cash registers, identification card 

readers) supply data streams to a central processing 
unit (12). The system (1) comprises a selecting circuit 

(16) for receiving the data stream and generating 
identification signals which are compared (17) with 

memorized reference data (18) for detecting a 
predetermined relationship between the data and emitting 

an enabling signal (19). Upon emission of the enabling 
signal (19), a win signal (21) may be generated for 

controlling selection of a code corresponding to a given 
prize.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a prize awarding
system.More specifically, the present invention relates
to a prize awarding system for commercial or financial
establishments (e.g. a supermarket, bank, motorway pay
toll, etc..) featuring one or more terminals which may
be cash registers, identification card (e.g. credit
card) readers, etc..Commercial establishments are known wherein the
workstations consist of terminals of a computer control
system featuring a central processing unit. In such
systems, each terminal is connected over a data line to
the central processing unit which receives and processes
data from the terminal, and supplies the terminal with the processed data.Patent US-A-4 906 826 describes a prize awarding system as described in the preamble of claim 1It is an object of the present invention to
provide a prize awarding system designed for application
to a system featuring one or more terminals as described
above.It is a further object of the present invention to 
provide a prize awarding system which does not interfere
with the normal running of the establishment.According to the present invention, there is
provided a prize awarding system as claimed in claim 1.A preferred non-limiting embodiment of the present
invention will be described by way of example with
reference to the accompanying drawing.The accompanying drawing shows a prize awarding
system 1 wherein a number of terminals 10 are connected
over a transmission line 11 (e.g. an optical fiber line,
radio line, etc.) to a central processing unit 12. In the example shown, terminals 10 are
conveniently cash registers.Each terminal 10 is supplied by central processing
unit 12 with data, e.g. product prices, stored in the
unit, and supplies unit 12 with data relative to sales.
Such a system is known and therefore requires no
detailed description.According to the present invention, a detecting
element 13 is provided along transmission line 11, for
connecting line 11 to an auxiliary device 14, supplying
auxiliary device 14 with a copy of the data stream along
line 11, and permitting data supply from auxiliary
device 14 to line 11; which element 13 may, for example,
be a through outlet located at any point along line 11
between terminals 10 and central processing unit 12.Device 14 comprises an adapting circuit 15 for
adapting the signals on line 11 to those of device 14
and vice versa, and which may, for example, be a
straightforward serial/parallel, parallel/serial or
protocol converter. Adapting circuit 15 is of known type
and
