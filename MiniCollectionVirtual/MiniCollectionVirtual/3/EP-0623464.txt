<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a high-speed 
web-fed flexographic printer, in particular, comprising 
at least one printing roller supporting a matrix strip, 
and an inking unit including an inking roller contacting 
the matrix strip on the printing roller. Printers of the aforementioned type are generally 
known to feature a relief matrix in the form of a sheet 
of flexible polymer material, and may form part of 
high-speed printing plants, mainly for printing black 
and white publications. On book printing plants, the 
matrix strip is generally in the form of an endless 
strip wound on to the printing roller, containing all 
the matrixes relative to the pages in the book, and so 
varying in length accordingly. For good quality printing, calendered or glazed 
paper of suitable substance must be employed; and known 
plants normally feature oil-based inking units 
comprising a series of rollers for grinding, mixing, 
spreading and transferring the ink on to the matrix 
strip.  Inking units of the aforementioned type present 
several drawbacks. To begin with, they are extremely 
cumbersome and complex as regards operation, due to the 
large number of rollers required for spreading the ink 
satisfactorily. The rollers are normally made of steel 
with a smooth outer surface to which the ink adheres 
mainly due to its viscosity, for spreading a thin film 
of ink on to the matrix strip. As oil-based ink is absorbed very slowly by the 
above types of paper, a drier must be provided for 
drying the web as soon as it is printed, which drying 
process seriously dehydrates the paper, often to the 
extent of altering its physical characteristics and even 
its size, so that further provision must be made for 
rehydrating the web. The high viscosity of oil-based ink also results 
in leftover ink accumulating to the side of the edge of 
the relief characters on the matrix, which leftover ink 
subsequently results in printed characters with a marked 
edge (edge effect) surrounding less heavily inked 
portions corresponding to the actual edge of the 
character, and by which the printed character is 
deformed and thickened. Moreover, oil-based inking units do not permit 
multicolour printing, due to the difficulty in rapidly 
cleaning or changing all the rollers when switching from 
one colour to another. Finally, oil-based inks also pose 
environmental problems, due to the nonbiodegradable and  
 
highly pollutant nature of the components involved, so 
that high-cost processes are required for disposing of 
leftover

<CLAIMS>
A high-speed web printer with flexographic 
matrix means (9, 12), comprising at least a printing 

roller (8) supporting said matrix means (9, 12); a 
pressure roller (14) for pressing said web (6) against 

said matrix means (9, 12) at a first portion of said 
printing roller (8); and an inking unit (18) including 

an inking roller (19) contacting said matrix means (9, 
12) at a second portion of said printing roller (8); 

characterized by the fact that the cylindrical outer 
surface of said inking roller (19) presents 

microincisions (24), and is partially immersed in 
water-based ink (23) inside a tank (21); blade type 

doctoring means (34) being provided for removing surplus 
ink from said surface prior to transferring the ink on 

to said matrix means (9, 12). 
A printer as claimed in Claim 1, characterized 
by the fact that said matrix means (9, 12) comprise a 

matrix strip (9) with a series of matrices (12)

Claims, characterized by the fact that said inking 

roller (19) presents a cylindrical support (29) made of 
steel and covered with a 0.5 to 2 mm thick layer of 

copper (31) in which said microincisions (24) are 
formed. 
A printer as claimed in Claim 5, characterized

foregoing Claims, characterized by the fact that 

rotation of said inking roller (19) is controlled by a 
servomotor (37) in turn controlled by a speed transducer 

(38) for detecting the speed of said printing roller 
(8). 
A printer as claimed in Claim 8, characterized 
by the fact that it forms part of an integrated book 

printing and manufacturing system; forward feed of said 
 

web (6) also being controlled by said transducer (38).

matrix strip (9) may also be inked alternatively by a 

second oil-based inking unit (43), and comprising means 
(44) for drying the printed web (6); characterized by 

the fact that said first inking unit (18) and at least 
part (51, 52) of said second inking unit (43) are
