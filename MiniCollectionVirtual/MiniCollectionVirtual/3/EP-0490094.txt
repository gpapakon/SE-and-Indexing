<ABSTRACT>
In this bridge, bridge sections (2 = 2.1, ..., 2.n) of identical construction are used both as ramp or end sections (2.1, 2.n) and as centre or intermediate sections (2.2, ...). Each bridge section (2) has a bottom chord (41) which consists of individual sections (38 to 40) connected to one another in an articulated manner. Each bridge section (2) has a continuous shaft arrangement (11, 7, 19, 7') by means of which the sections (38 to 40) can be extended downwards for increasing the stability of the bridge via couplings (16/30, 7/43/44/35) which can be engaged independently of one another and mechanical transmission elements (21 to 23, 35 to 37). When one bridge section (2) is coupled to only one other bridge section, only the part (38, 39) of the bottom chord (41) facing the other bridge section is extended downwards during coupling between two different bridge sections of the entire bottom chord (41). An associated placing vehicle (65) has a rotary drive (77) for the shaft arrangement (11, 7, 19, 7').

Dismountable bridge (1)
 
comprising several identical bridge sections (2) each with two laterally 

arranged identical bridge elements (3) each with one track girder (4) 
and a lower chord (41) connected to the latter via adjusting elements

the track girders of a bridge section being interconnected by means of 

crossbeams (6) and the track girders and lower chords of bridge 
sections arranged one behind the other being capable of being coupled 

together,
 
characterized in that in each bridge element (3) 


the lower chord (41) consists of sections (38 to 40) which are 
hinged together, 
at two lower chord sections (38) in each case two rigid posts (23, 
37) are hinged which at their other ends are each hinged to a 

spindle head (22, 36), 
two spindle heads (22, 36) in each case assigned to one lower 
chord section (38) engage spindle sleeves (21, 35),

ends (11) is inside the spindle sleeves (21, 35), and 
the spindle sleeves (21, 35) are connectable to the drive shaft 
arrangement (7, 19, 7') in each case via separate couplings 

(16/30; 7, 7', 43, 44, 45). 
Bridge according to claim 1, characterized in that the drive shaft 
arrangement (7, 19, 7') of each bridge element (3) comprises two drive 

shafts (7, 7') which are linked together via a connecting piece (19) such 
that they are torsionally stiff and axially displaceable,
 
the two drive shafts (7, 7') each being pressurized in the direction away 

from the bridge section (2) by a spring-type device (14) and in the case 
of one individual bridge section (2) protruding from the latter,
 
and that when a drive shaft (7, 7') moves against the force of the 

associated spring-type device (14) the nearest spindle sleeve (21), and
