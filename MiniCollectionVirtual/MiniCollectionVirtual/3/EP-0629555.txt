<ABSTRACT>
A plastic container (10) is configured for 
high pressure containment of fluid. The plastic 

container includes a tubular body portion (24) generally 
symmetric about a vertical axis, and a base portion (26) 

unitary with the body portion and having a plurality 
of feet (28) for supporting the container upright on a 

horizontal surface. In cross-section, the base of the 
container is defined by a first line comprising a 

series of curves of serially diminishing radius from 
the body portion through the axis to each of the feet. 
The series of curves having centers of curvature 
alternating between positions inside the container and 

positions outside the container.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to 
plastic bottles suitable for retention of fluids under 
pressure, including carbonated beverages or the like. 
In particular, the present invention relates to a 
footed plastic bottle having an integral base that 
provides a stable support for the plastic bottle on 
level surfaces. Carbonated beverages such as soft drinks 
are commonly packaged in lightweight, flexible, 
plastic containers. Because of their reduced rigidity 
as compared to glass containers, early efforts to 
manufacture plastic containers typically involved 
construction of hemispherical bases. A hemispherical 
base design can withstand high internal pressure and 
shock induced external pressures by evenly 
distributing the pressure induced stresses. A 
hemispherical base design maximizes the volume 
contained by a given amount of plastic material, and 
allows relatively thin plastic containers to withstand 
internal pressures as high as 100 p.s.i. without 
failure. However, hemispherical base containers 
are not without problems. Hemispherical base 
containers require a separate base cup to support the 
plastic container in an upright position. Manufacture 
and attachment of this separate base cup is not always 
cost-effective, in part because of increased  
 
manufacturing costs and because it requires 
incorporation of failure prone base cup attachment 
production steps. To avoid these problems, plastic 
container manufacturers have produced a variety of one 
piece plastic containers having a non-hemispherical 
bases modified to support the container. For example, 
"champagne" type bases having a complete annular ring 
capable of resting upon a level surface have been 
disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,722,726; 4,108,324; 
4,247,012; and 4,249,666. Although such one-piece 
champagne type plastic bottles are stable without a 
base cup, they still require significant increase in 
plastic resin to form the base, and even with the 
increased plastic resin are still prone to drop impact 
failure as compared to hemispherical bottles. An alternative to both hemispherical and 
champagne type bases has been developed. Commonly 
known as a "footed" container, this type of base is 
disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,598,270; 
4,294,366; 4,368,825; 4,865,206; and 4,867,323. 
Footed containers typically have multiple feet that 
bulge or protrude outward from an otherwise generally 
hemispherical base. Manufacture of such footed 
containers can be difficult, since uneven distribution
