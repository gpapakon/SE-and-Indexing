<ABSTRACT>
A method of electrochemically patterning a surface comprises providing an electrolyte overlying the surface and an array of electrodes adjacent the surface and in contact with the electrolyte, and altering the potential of one or more electrodes of the array so as to deposit or remove or chemically modify a substance on the surface adjacent the electrode. Several such treatments can be performed in sequence, using different electrodes of the array. The method is particularly suitable for step-wise chemical synthesis e.g. of oligonucleotides or other oligomers tethered to the surface. Electrode arrays for use in the method are also claimed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The ability to make devices with patterns of specific materials
printed on the surface has transformed the manufacture of electronic and
electrical components, and the discovery of new materials such as
semiconductors has made possible devices for a wide range of applications. The
properties of a device depend on the nature and the pattern of the materials on
the surface and much research goes into devising new materials and new
methods of fabrication, in order to improve production of existing devices and to
develop devices with novel applications.In Acc. Chem. Res. 1990, 23, 357-363, A J Bard et al describe the
use of scanning electrochemical microscopy as a new technique for the
characterisation and modification of surfaces. A pointed tip electrode is scanned
over a surface in the presence of an electrolyte and can be used to drive high
resolution electrochemical reactions on the surface.In one aspect, the invention provides a method of treating a region
of a surface, which method comprises providing an electrolyte overlying the
surface, and an array of independently switched electrodes adjacent the surface
and in contact with the electrolyte, and altering the potential of one or more of the
electrodes of the array so as to deposit or chemically modify a substance on the
surface at the regions adjacent those electrodes, wherein one or more of the
electrodes of the array are used as counter-electrodes, and the surface to be
modified does not form either an electrode or a counter-electrode.In another aspect the invention provides a device comprising an
array of independently switched electrodes in a form of a block of insulating
material having a first surface provided with electrodes spaced apart in an array;
electrical conducting means for altering the potential of each said electrode; a
body having a second surface to be electrochemically modified, which second
surface is electrically insulating; and means for holding the said block of
insulating material in spaced relationship with the said body, with the first surface
overlying the second surface so as to define therebetween a region for containing
electrolyte. Preferably the electrodes are of electrically conducting material are in
the form of parallel-lines spaced apart 
by no more than 0.5 mm.Preferably an array of electrodes is used to
treat several regions of the surface simultaneously,
and one or more of the electrodes of the array may be
used as counter-electrodes. For the purpose of
performing several electrochemical treatments in
sequence,
