The use of copolymers having incorporated by polymerisation 

a) 20 to 70%-wt. of a hydrophobic monomer selected from long-chain 
alpha-olefins with 12 to 30 C-atoms, long-chain alkyl(meth) 

acrylates with 12 to 30 C-atoms in the alkyl section, vinyl esters of 
long-chain carboxylic acids with 12 to 30 C-atoms, long-chain vinyl 

ethers with 12 to 30 C-atoms, or mixtures of these monomers, 
b) 1 to 60%-wt. of one or more monomers with a polysiloxane group 
according to formulas (I) and/or (II): 


A - Si (R¹)₂ - [OSi(R¹)₂]
n
 - R²
(R¹)₃Si [OSi(R¹)₂] n [OSiR¹ A]
z
 Si(R¹)₃
 
wherein the structural units [OSi(R¹)₂]
 and [OSiR¹A] in formula (II) 

are to be distributed randomly over the chain and wherein R¹ = 
phenyl or methyl, R² = A, phenyl or alkyl with 1 to 30 C-atoms, n = 

2 - 100, z = 1 - 3, and A is an unsaturated, radically polymerisable 
group selected from:  

 

CH₂ = CH - (CH₂)
m
 ―,
CH₂ = CH - CH₂ - X - (CH₂)p ―,
 
or  

 

 
and m = 0 to 10, p = 1 to 4, R³ = H or CH₃, and X = 0 or NH, 
c) 20 to 35%-wt. water-soluble, unsaturated, polymerisable, acid-groups-containing 
monomers and/or unsaturated C₄-C₆ dicarboxylic 

acid anhydrides and/or semi-esters or semi-amides of unsaturated C₄-C₆ 
dicarboxyli
c acids, or mixtures of these monomers, in partially 
neutralised form as aqueous solution or dispersion, for the softening, 

fat-liquoring, or hydrophobing of leather and furs. 
The use of the copolymers according to claim 1 characterised in 
that the sum of a), b), and c) adds up to 100%-wt. 
The use of the copolymers according to claim 1 or 2 characterised 
in that the copolymers are used in an amount of 2 to 15%-wt. of active 

substance, relative to the shaved weight of the leathers and furs. 
The use of the copolymers according to claims 1, 2, or 3 characterised 
in that the copolymers are used in combination with conventional 

hydrophobing agents. 
The use of the copolymers according to claims 1, 2, or 3 characterised 
in that the copolymers are used in combination with conventional 

fat-liquoring agents.
