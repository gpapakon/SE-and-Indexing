<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a method of manufacturing an absorbent article, 
wherein the speed of a part of a continuously moving web comprising a 

topsheet, backsheet, core or any combination thereof, is periodically 
varied, while maintaining a constant speed of the upstream and 

downstream parts of the web. The method comprises feeding the web past 
rotating transport rollers which are oscillated parallel to the web in the 

direction of transport and opposite to the direction of transport. Three 
web sections are during oscillation of the transport rollers maintained in a 

mutually parallel relationship. Translation- and rotation balancing means 
allow the transport rollers to be driven at high speeds and low variations 

in torque. The strain exerted on the web remains relatively low and is 
limited to the inertia forces that act on the web.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a method of making an absorbent article
comprising a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious backsheet and
an absorbent core interposed between the topsheet and the backsheet, the
method comprising the steps of:
a feeding a web, comprising the topsheet, the backsheet or the core or
a combination thereof along a stationary frame, along an upstream
trajectory, a downstream trajectory, and an intermediate trajectory
comprised between the upstream trajectory and the downstream
trajectory, the web having along the upstream trajectory and along the
downstream trajectory a substantially constant speed of transport, the
upstream and the downstream trajectory being substantially stationary
relative to the frame,b running the web along an upstream and a downstream transport
roller that are periodically displaceable, andc periodically displacing the transport rollers around a stationary
equilibrium position.The invention also relates to an apparatus for carrying out the method
according to the invention. It is well known in the art to produce absorbent articles such as disposable
diapers by combining a liquid pervious topsheet, a liquid impervious
backsheet and an absorbent core to form a continuously moving web. In
the American patent US-A-4,081,301, a method is described to
continuously attach discrete lengths of elastic ribbon to the moving web
by feeding a continuous elastic ribbon in a pre-stretched state into the nip
in which the topsheet and backsheet are joined around the absorbent core.
The continuous elastic ribbon which runs along the longitudinal sides of
the web, is provided with adhesive at pre-determined intervals. After
cutting the web transversely to form individual diapers, parts of the
elastic ribbons that have not been provided with glue, retract to their
relaxed state to be positioned within the periphery of the topsheet and the
backsheet, without gathering the topsheet and the backsheet in the
unattached areas. GB-A-1,058,883 (D1) relates to an apparatus for periodically operating on webs. D1
does not teach a method and an apparatus for manufacturing absorbent articles; nor a
method for manufacturing articles wherein the web to be treated has different
thicknesses and different basis weights. Furthermore, D1 does not disclose a
displacement-balancing means and a rotational mass balance system; an apparatus
which is suitable for high speed applications and which is run at high frequencies; a low
power electric drive system; a rotating crank for the stroke
