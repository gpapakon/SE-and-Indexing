<ABSTRACT>
A heat sink (13) is attached to a semiconductor 
element (11) functioning as an exothermic element, which 

is mounted on a circuit board (15) and has a predetermined 
allowable power consumption, thereby cooling the 

semiconductor element (11). A semiconductor element 
(12) having a lower allowable power consumption than
 the 
semiconductor element (11) having the predetermined 

power consumption, which is hardly exposed to a cooling 
air flow cooled via the heat sink (13), is connected to 

a heat conductive auxiliary member (14) connected at one 
end to the heat sink (13). Thus, the heat radiation 

efficiency of the semiconductor element (12) having the 
lower allowable power consumption is enhanced.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a semiconductor
apparatus with high integration density, which is
capable of effectively cooling a semiconductor element
with low radiation efficiency.A conventional semiconductor apparatus comprising
mainly a plurality of semiconductor elements mounted on
a circuit board such as a printed circuit board or a
ceramic board consumes much power and is equipped
mixedly with high-power-consuming, highly exothermic
semiconductor elements (hereinafter referred to as
"exothermic element" or "exothermic semiconductor element") and semiconductor elements having
less power consumption than the exothermic element and
having not so high exothermic properties (hereinafter
referred to as "IC element"). Normally, the packages
of all exothermic elements are provided with heat sinks
such as cooling fins. Recently, the exothermic density
has remarkably increased due to an increase in
integration of the semiconductor element itself and an
increase in density of integration of semiconductor
elements. Accordingly, the cooling of the semiconductor
apparatus is a serious problem.An example of a semiconductor apparatus having the
conventional cooling structure will now be described
with reference to FIG. 1 (plan view) and FIG. 2
(partial cross-sectional view). Some semiconductor
apparatuses are combined into a single system having 
a predetermined function. The system is provided with a
cooling apparatus for forcibly producing an air flow.
The cooling apparatus introduces an air wind into the
system, thereby dissipating heat generated by a
semiconductor apparatus situated at a predetermined
position within the system, as shown in FIG. 1.A wiring pattern such as a Cu layer is formed on a
major surface of a circuit board 15 such as a printed
circuit board (PCB). Semiconductor elements mounted on
the circuit board 15 are connected to the wiring
pattern. On the circuit board 15, an exothermic element
11 is situated at a position where the air flow can be
utilized most effectively. An IC element 12 and peripheral
circuits (not shown) are formed on the other
region. A cooling fin 13 with high heat radiation properties
is attached to the surface of the package of the
exothermic element 11 such as a CPU which must be
designed most deliberately in terms of thermal
properties. The cooling fin 13 receives an air flow 16
produced from a cooling device 20 attached to the
system, thus radiating heat from the exothermic element
11. The IC element 12 such as a memory with not so high
exothermic properties is
