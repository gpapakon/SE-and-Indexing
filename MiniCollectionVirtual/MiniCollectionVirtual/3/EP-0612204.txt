<ABSTRACT>
A method and system are provided for mounting a 
header assembly (10) to a mounting surface (12) of an 

electrical apparatus (14) through the use of a vacuum-suction 
nozzle (18). The header assembly includes a 

dielectric housing (20) adapted to be positioned adjacent 
the mounting surface. The assembly includes a plurality of 

terminals (22) mounted in the housing. The terminals have 
tail portions (24) for interconnection to circuitry (28) of 

the electrical apparatus and pin portions (26) projecting 
from the housing. A slip-off cover (16) has a plurality of 

pin-receiving passages (30) for receiving free ends (26a) 
of the pin portions of at least some of the terminals. The 

pin portions are interference-fit in the passages to allow 
the cover and the header assembly to be mounted together to 

the electrical apparatus and to allow the cover to be slid 
off the terminals after the tail portions of the terminals 

are interconnected to the circuitry of the electrical 
apparatus. The cover has a smooth top surface area (32) of 

a size sufficient for engagement by the vacuum-suction 
nozzle (18) for conjoint manipulation and positioning of 

the header assembly (10) and the cover (16).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention generally relates to the art of
electrical connectors and, particularly, to a
method of positioning a header assembly on a mounting surface of
an electrical apparatus and a system for mounting a header
assembly to a mounting surface of an electrical apparatus,
wherein the
header
includes a positioning cover that is slipped or slid off of
terminal pins of the header after the pins are
interconnected to an electrical apparatus, such as after
the pins are soldered to a printed circuit board.With the continuing trend toward compact
electronic apparatus, there is an ever-increasing demand
for miniaturized interconnection systems between the
electronic components of the apparatus. An example is in
computer apparatus wherein there is a constant demand to
reduce the thickness or height parameters of the electronic
components. With the components mounted on a printed
circuit board, the thickness or height parameters relate to
the distance above the board in which desired
interconnections are made and which constantly are being
miniaturized.One approach to such miniaturization is to
eliminate bulky electrical connector housings and, instead,
to use relatively thin headers or header blocks for
locating and/or inserting terminal pins into appropriate
holes in the printed circuit board. The pins then are
soldered to circuit traces on the board or in the holes,
and a complementary connector assembly can be mounted
directly to the pins projecting upwardly from the then
header block. Problems continue to be encountered in handling
such header assemblies for mounting to a mounting surface
of an electrical apparatus, such as positioning the header
assembly on the printed circuit board. As is known, a
soldering reflow vessel often is used in automatically
mounting electrical connectors to printed circuit boards.
It has become expedient to use a vacuum-suction nozzle for
handling the electrical connector during the soldering
reflow process. Specifically, an electrical connector is
secured by a vacuum-suction nozzle, and the electrical
connector is manipulated in position and brought to a
selected position on the printed circuit board by the
vacuum-suction nozzle. The electrical connector then is
released from the vacuum-suction nozzle by stopping
application of negative pressure thereto. After all of the
desired components are mounted to the printed circuit
board, gas is released inside the soldering reflow vessel
or infrared rays are radiated therein until the solder
applied to selected conductors on the

A method of positioning a header assembly
(10) on a mounting surface (12) of an electrical apparatus

(14) through the use of a vacuum-suction nozzle (18),
comprising the steps of:


providing a header assembly (10) with a
dielectric housing (20) and a plurality of terminals (22)

mounted on the housing, with the terminals having tail
portions (24) exposed at one side of the housing and pin

portions (26) projecting from another side of the housing;
providing a slip-off cover (16) with a plurality
of pin-receiving passages (30), the cover having a smooth

top surface area (32) of a size sufficient for engagement
by the vacuum-suction nozzle;
sliding the cover onto free-ends (26a) of at
least some of pin portions of the terminals with an

interference-fit between the pin portions and the pin-receiving
passages in the cover;
engaging the smooth top surface area (32) of the
cover (16) with the vacuum-suction nozzle (18);
positioning the header assembly (10) and the
cover (16) together on the mounting surface (12) of the

electrical apparatus (14);
soldering the tail portions (24) of the terminals
to circuitry (28) on the electrical apparatus (14); and
sliding the cover (16) off of the free ends (26a)
of the pin portions (26) of the terminals (22) .
The method of claim 1 wherein said slip-off
cover (16), at least in one area thereof adjacent the

housing of the header assembly (10), is provided with
peripheral dimensions small enough to be contained within

the peripheral bounds of the header assembly. 
The method of claim 1 wherein said slip-off
cover (16) is provided with a given thickness, and

including providing an interference-fit between the pin
portions (26) of the terminals and the pin-receiving

passages (30) of a length (A) less than the thickness of
the cover thereby reducing the amount of force required to

slide the cover off the pin portions of the terminals.
A system for mounting a header assembly (10)

comprising:


a header assembly (10) including a dielectric
