<ABSTRACT>
The technical field of the invention generally concerns systems for interactive access to stored video data. In particular, a video file server (20) includes both a random access data storage subsystem (78) and an archive data storage subsystem (82) for storing compressed video data. In response to commands from subscriber system (66), the video file server (20) transmits compressed video data to the subscriber systems (66) over lines (64A-64H), or receives compressed video data therefrom. Commands from the subscriber systems (66) may cause the video file server (20) to store compressed video data received from the subscriber systems (66) in the random access data storage subsystem (78) and/or archive data storage subsystem (82). Compression-decompression cards (42) included in the video file server (20) provide an authoring capability for storing compressed video and/or audio data in the random access data storage subsystem (78) and/or archive data storage subsystem (82), and for converting from one data compression standard to another.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates generally to the technical
field of electronic storage and transmission of video data and,
more particularly, to the storage of such video data in a
compressed digital format, and to transmission of compressed
format video data over a comparatively narrow bandwidth communication
channel such as that provided by an Integrated
Services Digital Network ("ISDN") twisted pair communication
channel.To deal rationally with the complexity of present communication
systems and with the need to make different systems
mutually compatible, the International Standards Organization
("ISO") developed a model for specifying such systems. Using
this model, called the Open Systems Interconnect ("OSI") model,
a communication system can be broken down into a hierarchial
structure that permits standards to be defined at each level
in the structure. The OSI model provides a hierarchy of seven
different layers that can occur in a communication system.
Each layer in the OSI model covers a different function
performed by the communication system.The lowest layer in the OSI model, called the physical
layer, specifies the physical structure of interfaces in a
particular communication system or network. Thus, a standard
for the physical layer of a communication system specifies such
things as the number of wires, their electrical characteristics,
the characteristics of signals transmitted over the
wires, connectors used for joining two sets of wires into a
single longer set of wires, etc.The next higher layer in the OSI model, called the data
link layer, specifies how data is transmitted error free
through the communication system. Thus, a standard for the
second layer in the OSI model specifies how to detect errors
in transmissions passing over the physical layer, and how to
correct any errors that may occur during transmission. The next higher layer in the OSI model, called the network
layer, specifies the manner in which connections are formed
between various places in the communication system for transmitting
data between them. The standard for the third layer
in the OSI model, therefore, specifies the signals transmitted
over the data link layer that cause the communication system
to transfer data between two places on the network.A standard defined by an International Telegraph and
Telephone Consultative Committee ("CCITT") for the ISDN
communication channel specifies these three lowest levels in
the OSI model. Under the CCITT standard, a basic ISDN access
consists of two full-duplex 64 kilobits
