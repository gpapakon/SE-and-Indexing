<ABSTRACT>
A tool assembly (1) comprising first (3) and second (2) tool assembly components adapted to be coaxially coupled together so as to have a common longitudinal axis and so that a motion drive transmitted to the first component (3) is transmitted to the second (2) component; the components being formed with interfitting male (9) and female (12) coupling members, each coupling member being formed with at least two terminal lobe (10, 13) portions and a central (11, 14), symmetrically disposed portion which is inset with respect to its associated lobe portions, the central portion (11) of the male coupling member mating within the central portion (14) of the female coupling member whilst each lobe portion (10) of the male coupling member mates within a lobe portion (13) of the female coupling member so as to form a mating pair of lobe portions; the coupling members being formed, adjacent each mating pair of lobe portions and remote from the axis with respective pairs of surfaces of which at least one is curved so that, upon relative rotational displacement of the components about the common axis a point of contact is established between at least one pair of surfaces, such that an angle  mu  defined between a tangent to the curved surface at the point of contact and a radius extending from the common axis to the point of contact lies substantially between -10 DEG  and +25 DEG .

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tool assembly, in particular to 
a multi-component tool assembly such as, for example, a rotary cutting tool 
assembly, of the kind comprising at least two components, e.g. a tool or an 
adapter for a tool and a holder, adapted to be coupled together. In such tool assemblies, particularly of the rotary kind, the two 
component members of the assembly are coupled together as a result 
of the torque generated during rotary machining operations. For this 
purpose, the component members of the assembly can be respectively 
formed with similarly shaped projections and recesses which are adapted to 
cooperate with each other so as to bring the component members into a 
clamping engagement. The coupling between the component members of 
the assembly has to be rigid enough to meet the reliability requirements, 
especially for hard machining conditions, as well as to provide accurate 
mutual coaxial alignment of the component members, with respect to each  
 
other and with respect to the central rotary axis and also to ensure absence 
of rotational clearance when rotary motion is transferred from a driving 
component member to a driven component member. There are known tool assemblies such as are used in composite 
milling cutters, where the coupling of a replaceable front end or intermediate 
component to a basic holder is achieved by means of pins which protrude 
from the component to engage with corresponding recesses in the basic 
holder. These assemblies are disadvantageous in view of the fact that to 
ensure reliable coupling many additional constructional elements are 
required. In another known assembly disclosed in U.S. Patents Nos. 
4,834,597 and 4,934,883 (preamble of claim 1) and used with milling cutters and drilling tools, 
there are two component members, one of which is a tool or an adapter for 
a tool and the other is a holder having a recess adapted to receive a 
correspondingly-shaped projection of the first member. The cooperating 
surfaces of the recess and the projection have a non-circular cross-section 
with at least two radial extensions so that the component members of the 
assembly cannot rotate with respect to one another. The assembly further 
comprises means for relative clamping together of the members. The disadvantage of this known assembly is that the actual 
regions of contact between the cooperating surfaces of the component 
members and therefore the distribution of the wedging forces generated 
during machining operations cannot be exactly
