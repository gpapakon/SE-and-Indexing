<ABSTRACT>
In an injection unit on injection-moulding machines for producing thermoplastic articles, the injection unit (1) having a plasticising and injecting cylinder (2, 5), a plasticising and injecting screw (3) which can be moved axially and can rotate in the said cylinder, an injection nozzle (10, 12), which can be shut off from the plasticising cylinder (2), and also a pigment metering device (15 to 19) with at least one pigment container (16), which is connected via a pigment feed line (15) to the injection unit (1), according to the invention it is provided that in the pigment feed line (15) there is integrated a pigment metering cylinder (17), the piston movement of which is coupled with the axial movement of the plasticising and injecting screw (3), and that in the injection nozzle (10, 12) the pigment feed line (15) opens out in the plasticised melt stream and downstream of the mouth of the pigment feed line (15), in the conveying direction, there is arranged a mixer (14).

Injection unit on injection moulding machines for
producing thermoplastic mouldings wherein the injection unit

(1) comprises a plasticising and injection cylinder (2), a
plasticising and injection screw (3) arranged rotatably and

axially displaceably therein and a colorant metering device
(17) with at least one colorant container (16) connected via a

colorant supply line (15) to the injection unit (1) which
opens into the plasticised mass flow in the injection nozzle

(10, 12), and a mixer (14) is arranged downstream of the inlet
of the colorant supply line (15), characterised in that a

colorant metering cylinder (17) is integrated into the
colorant supply line (15) and the movement of the metering

piston (18) is coupled to the axial movement of the
plasticising and injection screw (3) via a lever mechanism

(19), the degree of coupling being adjustable, and in that in
the nozzle chamber (12) there is arranged a mass flow divider

(13) in whose flow shadow the added colorant is introduced.
Injection unit according to claim 2, characterised in
that the mass flow divider (13) is conical in design, the tip

of the cone pointing in the direction of the plasticising
screw (3).
Injection unit according to claim 1 or 2, characterised
in that the mixer (14) is a static mixer. 
Injection unit according to one of claims 1 to 3,
characterised in that the colorant container(s) (16) can be

acted upon by compressed air.
Injection unit according to one of claims 1 to 4,
characterised in that a respective nonreturn valve (21, 23) is

arranged between the inlet of the colorant supply line (15)
and the colorant metering cylinder (17) and between the

colorant metering cylinder (17) and the colorant container
(16).
Injection unit according to one of claims 1 to 5,
characterised in that the mass flow divider (13) and the mixer

(14) are arranged in a tubular housing (12) which can be
connected to the outlet orifice (19).
