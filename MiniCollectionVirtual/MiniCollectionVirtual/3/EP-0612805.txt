<ABSTRACT>
This invention relates to an emulsion polymer blend comprising from 95 to 40 
percent by weight, preferably 90 to 60 percent by weight, of at least one first latex 

which is multi-stage comprising from 95 to 50 percent by weight, preferably 75 to 60 
percent by weight, of at least one soft stage polymer having a Tg less than 50°C, 

preferably less than 10°C, and from 5 to 50 percent by weight, preferably 25 to 40 
percent by weight, of at least one hard stage polymer having a Tg from 20°C to 

160°C, the Tg of the soft stage polymer being lower than the Tg of the hard stage 
polymer, characterized in that there is provided from 5 to 60 percent by weight, 

preferably 10 to 40 percent by weight, of at least one second latex, the second latex 
not forming a film at ambient temperature. 
The emulsion polymer blend of this invention can be used to formulate a 
variety of aqueous coating compositions, such as for example, paints, mastics, 

caulks, sealants, varnishes, floor polishes, and the like. The emulsion polymer blend 
of this invention is also useful for formulating an aqueous coating composition 

which is coalescent-free.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous film-forming compositions containing a 
blend of emulsion polymers as a binder. The compositions of the invention are useful, for 
example, as or in the formulation of paints, mastics, caulks, sealants, varnishes, clear 
coatings, paper coatings, textile coatings and floor polishes. An important physical characteristic of emulsion polymers is the glass 
transition temperature ("Tg") and is an inherent physical property of the monomer or 
monomers used to make the polymer. The Tg of a polymer determines its relative 
hardness or softness. The higher the Tg the harder the polymer; the lower the Tg, the 
softer the polymer. The Tg of a polymer also determines the physical characteristics of a 
film formed from a coating composition containing the polymer, as well as the minimum 
temperature at which the coating composition containing the polymer can be applied to a 
substrate to form a film. Increasing the Tg of an emulsion polymer used as a binder in a coating 
composition will increase the hardness of the final coating. The hardness of the coating 
is important because it affects other desirable properties of the coating, such as, block 
resistance, print resistance, dirt pick-up resistance, tack-free ability, and mar resistance. "Block resistance", as used herein, refers to the resistance of coated 
surfaces to stick together when stacked or placed in contact with each other under 
pressure. Painted surfaces often come in contact with each other in, for example, window 
and door areas, and sometimes stick together, which is undesirable. Block resistance is 
improved by increasing the hardness of the coating. "Print resistance", as used herein, refers to the ability of a coating to resist 
imprinting by the force due to contact with another surface. Substrates painted with 
interior semigloss and gloss paints often come into contact with other objects, such as, for 
example, flower pots on window sills. This can cause a permanent impression in the paint 
film due to the pressure exerted by the object. This tendency for a paint film to "print" is 
undesirable. Print resistance is improved by increasing the hardness of the coating.  
 "Dirt pick-up resistance", as used herein, refers to the ability of a coated 
surface to resist the deposit of foreign matter consisting of dirt, soot, or stain onto a 
coated substrate. The deposit of foreign matter onto a coated substrate is aesthetically 
undesirable and the deposited material may be difficult to remove from the coated 
sub
