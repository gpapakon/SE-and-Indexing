<ABSTRACT>
A porous alumina coating layer covering an oxide 
semiconductor type or solid electrolyte type oxygen 

concentration sensor carrys a catalyst (Pt/Ph) for 
accelerating equilibration reaction of an unburnt gas in 

exhaust gas from an automobile engine. The deterioration 
of the catalyst activity can be prevented by 

incorporating a thermal stability improving agent into 
the alumina.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an oxygen
concentration sensor, more particularly to an oxygen
concentration sensor with a modified alumina coating
layer on the surface of the sensor.Oxygen concentration sensors are used in
various fields, particularly as a sensor for controlling
exhaust gas from an engine in an automobile. The oxygen
concentration sensors include an oxygen concentration
differential cell type, utilizing zirconia (ZrO2) solid
electrolyte, and a resistance variation-detecting type,
utilizing titania (TiO2) semiconductor.Such oxygen concentration sensors typically
have a porous alumina coating layer on which a catalyst
of Pt/Rh is carried, such as disclosed in JP-A-55 124 057 (Patent Abstracts of Japan vol.4, no. 180 (P-040), 1980). The porous alumina coating layer
traps oil components and so forth and the catalyst of
Pt/Rh accelerates equilibration of unburnt components
such as hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the exhaust
gas. The porous alumina coating layer is formed by
sintering at about 1100°C. The catalyst is then carried
on the porous alumina coating layer by dropwise applying
a solution containing Pt chloride and Rh chloride to the
coating layer or dipping the coating layer in the
solution and heating them to reduce the Pt and Rh
chlorides, by which fine Pt and Rh particles are
deposited on the porous alumina coating layer.The US-A-3 935 089 discloses an oxygen sensor comprising a layer
of a solid electrolyte and electrodes formed on opposite sides
of the electrolyte layer. A coating of a porous inorganic
material such as γ-type Al2O3 is formed on one electrode
communicating with the gas to be measured, and the coating is
impregnated with a catalyst of Pt or Pd. The method of making a
porous and Pt-impregnated γ-type Al2O3 coating comprises the
steps of depositing α-type Al2O3 on a surface of a Pt electrode
by means of plasma injection, adjusting the temperature of the
deposited α-type Al2O3 to transform it into γ-type Al2O3
impregnating the γ-type Al2O3 with chloroplatinic acid, and
heating the impregnated coating in a hydrogen atmosphere.The oxygen concentration sensors having a
catalyst-carrying alumina coating layer have an excellent
performance at the beginning, but the output of the
sensors and the reaction speed are lowered after use for
a long time.  The object of the present invention is to
provide an oxygen concentration sensor which can have a
normal output for a long time, or a prolonged life time.The above and other objects of the present invention
are attained by
