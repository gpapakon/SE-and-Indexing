<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
removing nitrogen oxides (hereinafter referred to as NOx
in some cases) present in a waste gas, by contacting said
waste gas with a catalyst in the presence of a reducing
agent (e.g. ammonia or a hydrocarbon) to catalytically
reduce and remove the nitrogen oxides in the waste gas,
as well as to a catalyst used in said method.More particularly, the present invention
relates to a method for removing nitrogen oxides present
in a waste gas, by decomposing said nitrogen oxides into
nitrogen and water efficiently in the presence of a
reducing agent by the use of a shaped catalyst which has
high mechanical strengths, excellent durability and high
heat resistance at high temperatures of 450°C or above,
as well as to a catalyst used in said method.In the conventional treatment of waste gases,
the waste gases from boilers, etc. were treated mainly.
Hence, the temperatures for the treatment were low at
450°C or below and the catalysts used for the treatment
were mainly shaped catalysts (honeycomb catalysts) comprising
titanium oxide as a main carrier and an active
component (e.g. vanadium, tungsten or molybdenum). In
order to allow a shaped catalyst (e.g. a honeycomb catalyst)
to have increased mechanical strengths, it was
proposed to add an inorganic fiber to a shaped catalyst
[e.g. Japanese Patent Publication No. 20357/1976, Japanese
Patent Publication No. 35055/1982, Japanese Patent
Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 182036/1988 and
Japanese Patent Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No.
208263/1990].Since the adverse effect of this addition of 
inorganic fiber on the activity of shaped catalyst is
small when the catalyst is used at low temperatures such
as mentioned above, said addition of inorganic fiber was
studied only from the standpoints of the moldability,
shape retainability and mechanical strengths of inorganic
fiber-added catalyst.Meanwhile, the waste gases emitted from gas
turbines, open-hearth furnaces for steel making, etc.
have high temperatures. In the treatment of these waste
gases to remove NOx present therein, there are required
catalysts capable of exhibiting a sufficient activity
even at high temperatures of above 450°C. Hence, there
were proposed various catalysts [e.g. Japanese Patent
Application Kokai (Laid-Open) No. 83039/1990].In order for shaped catalysts (e.g. honeycomb
catalysts) of industrial use to have sufficient shape
retainability and sufficient mechanical strengths, it is
essential that they contain an inorganic fiber. FR-A-2 435 967
