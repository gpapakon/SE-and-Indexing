<ABSTRACT>
A phosphite is provided having the formula: 

wherein Y¹ is an alkyl group and Y² is selected 
from the group consisting of sec-butyl and tert-butyl. 

The phosphite exhibits enhanced stability 
including hydrolytic and UV stability, and is 

useful in stabilizing thermoplastic compositions.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to phosphites,
and more particularly related to neoalkyl phenyl
phosphites.Neoalkyl phenyl phosphites are known, see
US-A-3415906, DE-A-2944254 and Dever et al U.S. Patent
3,714,302. Dever et al teaches neoalkyl phenyl
phosphites of the formula:

wherein R and R' are independently lower alkyl
groups and X, Y and Z are independently selected
from the group consisting of -H and alkyl groups
of from 1 to 5 carbon atoms, providing that the
sum of the carbon atoms in X, Y and Z does not
exceed 5, may be simply and economically produced
by the reaction of a neoglycol with PCl3 in the
absence of a catalyst, HCl acceptor and solvent
to produce a crude product of the formula:

wherein R and R' are defined above, followed by
reaction with phenol or a compound of the
formula: 

in which X, Y and Z are defined above. The
desired product of Dever et al. may be recovered
by distillation.Suitable glycols are listed and include 2-ethyl-2-butyl-1,3
propane diol among others.Dever et al. U.S. Patent 3,714,302 clearly
teaches away from compounds wherein X and Z are
both alkyl groups such that they create stearic
hinderance. Specifically note col. 3, lines 63
to 65 thereof wherein it states that the proviso
that the sum of X, Y and Z does not exceed 5
excludes such phenols as 2,6-di-tertiarybutyl
phenols from consideration because of stearic
hinderance problems.Dever et al U.S. Patent 3,467,733 discloses
compounds of the formula:

wherein R is independently selected from the
group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 6
carbon atoms, and halogen; X is a monovalent
radical of the formula: 

wherein R2 independently selected from the group
consisting of hydrogen, alkyl of 1 to 12 carbon
atoms and halogen, and R3 is independently
selected from the group consisting of alkyl of 1
to 12 carbon atoms and halogen, and sets forth in
Claim 7 a phosphite of the formula:
Many of these phosphites can, however,
experience thermal stability problems, hydrolytic
stability problems, and/or ultraviolet light
discoloration problems.Consequently, there is a need for a neoalkyl
aryl phosphite exhibiting improved ultraviolet
and hydrolytic stability.The present invention involves a neoalkyl
aryl phosphite of the formula:

wherein Y1 is
alkyl, and
preferably Y1 is a tert-butyl group and Y2 is a 
tert-butyl or sec-butyl group. The phosphites
are useful to stabilize organic materials against
thermal oxidative degradation, exhibit enhanced
hydrolytic stability and are resistant to UV
yellowing.The phosphite is a
