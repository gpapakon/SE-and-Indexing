<ABSTRACT>
The device comprises a type of cam with deformable and/or displaceable profile using an incompressible pressurized fluid (liquid) with calibrated channels and/or throttling passages, which allows the advance or delay in timing of the opening and/or closing of each of the valves of an internal combustion engine. The functioning of the device is based on the effect which a fluid under pressure, controlled by throttling passages and acting internally to a cam has on the overall structure of a cam or on elastic elements moving with said.

<DESCRIPTION>
 "Device with cams using incompressible fluid as structural element to bring about the deformation and/or displacement of cam profiles, in order to vary engine valve timing".DESCRIPTIONThe invention concerns a fluid-mechanical device allowing a variation of the timing of the opening and/or closing of each of the valves of an internal combustion engine.Numerous systems are known for obtaining variable timing in internal combustion engines.The state of the art includes both mechanical systems and systems functioning with fluid under pressure; in both cases the solutions are often complex and unreliable in their construction.Those systems utilizing exclusively mechanical 

actuating mechanisms present the well-known disadvantages of complicated construction, rapid wear and low reliability (pats DE,A, 3 ,705 ,128 - DE,A, 3,720,947 - US,A, 3 , 14 ,099 ) .In fact, as is known, the fluid-mechanical systems used in the construction of machines in general have now almost completely taken the place of traditional exclusively mechanical systems since the latter provide only partial, unreliable and uneconomical solutions; in addition, the mechanical systems proposed in the cited patents have such a large number of components that the production of a reliable camshaft from the point of view of resistance to wear and operational life whilst keeping the dimension of the camshaft of the same order of magnitude as present ones, is impossible. It may be added that the purely mechanical systems used in the above cited patents are very costly because of the sophisticated micro-mechanical treatments that have to be given; fluid-mechanical systems would solve numerous technical as well as cost problems completely because of the inherent simplicity in the design of apparatus actuated by fluid pressure.The systems with fluid-mechanical actuation known through the patent literature have, however, an 

inherent instability in their functioning that renders their practical application impossible; the fluid in the cases cited cannot in fact guarantee the geometric stability of the cam profile in all intermediate positions that the latter can take up (Honda pat. appl. nr. 6042338 - 4/3/1985).This drawback has been brought to light by tests conducted on devices of the above-mentioned type. In particular there exists a patent application n. R 91 A 000572, assigned to the present assignees, in which a "cam device having deformable and/or displaceable profile, using fluid under pressure, to vary the timing of engine valves" is

<CLAIMS>
CLAIMS 1. Device with cams to vary engine valve timing, using incompressible fluid as a structural element to produce the deformation and/or displacement of cam profiles, characterized by the fact that:
- functioning of the device is guaranteed by the presence of appropriatel -dimensioned calibrated channels and/or throttling passages which are placed upstream from each and every deformable and/or displaceable part-profile; said calibrated channels and/or throttling passages allow the passage of the incompressible fluid, and therefore the variation in volume of the cavities 3 , in a characteristic time comparable to characteristic times of variation of engine speed; said calibrated channels and/or throttling passages prevent the return of fluid from the cavities underneath the portions of profile which are deformable and/or displaceable towards the center of the camshaft during transit of the deformable and/or displaceable walls over the tappets;
- the volumes of incompressible fluid occupying the cavities 3 enter and exit continually said cavities in accordance with any change in engine speed, that is with every acceleration and 


deceleration of the engine.
2. Device with cams, according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that the displacements of the yielding walls depend on the volume of fluid present in cavities 3.
3. Device with cams, according to claim 1, characterized by the fact that variation in valve timing is obtainable by displacing, solely through use of quantities of incompressible fluid, the geometric axis of the base cylinder of the cam with respect to the axis of rotation of the camshaft.
