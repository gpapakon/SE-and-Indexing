<ABSTRACT>
An aortic graft (150) for intraluminal delivery to repair an 
abdominal aortic aneurysm is provided with at least one wire (315) 

which is woven into the distal, or lower, end (162) of the graft 
(150), which 

wire (315) permits the distal end (162) of the graft (150) to conform 
to, and 

sealingly engage, within the aortic bifurcation region (310) of the 
aneurysm.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an aortic graft for intraluminal
delivery, for repairing an
abdominal aortic aneurysm.An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a sac caused by an
abnormal dilation of the wall of the aorta, a major artery of
the body, as it passes through the abdomen. The abdomen is
that portion of the body which lies between the thorax and the
pelvis. It contains a cavity, known as the abdominal cavity,
separated by the diaphragm from the thoracic cavity and lined
with a serous membrane, the peritoneum. The aorta is the main
trunk, or artery, from which the systemic arterial system
proceeds. It arises from the left ventricle of the heart,
passes upward, bends over and passes down through the thorax 
and through the abdomen to about the level of the fourth
lumbar vertebra, where it divides into the two common iliac
arteries.The aneurysm usually arises in the infrarenal portion of
the arterioscleroticly diseased aorta, for example, below the
kidneys. When left untreated, the aneurysm will eventually
cause rupture of the sac with ensuing fatal hemorrhaging in a
very short time. High mortality associated with the rupture
has led to the present state of the art and the transabdominal
surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Surgery
involving the abdominal wall, however, is a maj or undertaking
with associated high risks. There is considerable mortality
and morbidity associated with this magnitude of surgical
intervention, which in essence involves replacing the diseased
and aneurysmal segment of blood vessel with a prosthetic
device which typically is a synthetic tube, or graft, usually
fabricated of either DACRON®, TEFLON®, or other suitable
material.To perform the surgical procedure, requires exposure of
the aorta through an abdominal incision which can extend from
the rib cage to the pubis. The aorta must be closed both
above and below the aneurysm, so that the aneurysm can then be
opened and the thrombus, or blood clot, and arteriosclerotic
debris removed. Small arterial branches from the back wall of
the aorta are tied off. The DACRON® tube, or graft, of
approximately the same size of the normal aorta is sutured in
place, thereby replacing the aneurysm. Blood flow is then
reestablished through the graft. It is necessary to move the
intestines in order to get to the back wall of the abdomen
prior to clamping off the aorta.If the surgery is performed prior to rupturing of the
abdominal aortic aneurysm, the survival rate of treated
patients is markedly higher than if the surgery is performed
after

<CLAIMS>
An aortic graft for intraluminal delivery to repair an abdominal aortic aneurysm (151)
in an aorta (152) having two iliac arteries (153) associated therewith at an aortic

bifurcation (301), comprising:

a tube (160) having first and second ends (161, 162), an intermediate portion
disposed between the first and second ends, and a wall surface (163) disposed

between the two ends, at least a portion of the tube adapted to be disposed
within the abdominal aortic aneurysm (151), the intermediate portion of the

tube being not substantially radially expandable, and the first end of the tube
being radially expandable;
a first means (165) for securing the first end (161) of the tube to the aorta, the first
securing means having a first diameter which permits intraluminal delivery

of the first securing means into the aorta and the first securing means having
a second, expanded diameter, to secure the first end of the tube to the aorta;

and
a second means (310) for securing the second end of the tube at the aortic
bifurcation, the second means for securing being disposed at the second end

of the tube and comprising at least one wire (315) associated with the second
end of the tube, the at least one wire (315) and the second end (162) of the

tube having a first cross-sectional configuration which permits intraluminal
delivery of the tube and the second securing means within the aortic

bifurcation (301), and a second enlarged cross-sectional configuration,
wherein the at least one wire and the second end of the tube conform to, and

sealingly engage, the interior surface of the aortic bifurcation (301).
The aortic graft of claim 1, wherein the at least one wire (315) is associated with the
second end of the tube by weaving the at least one wire into the second end (162) of the

tube. 
The aortic graft of claim 2, wherein the at least one wire (315) is woven into the
second end of the tube in a generally zigzag pattern.
The aortic graft of claim 2, wherein the at least one wire (315) is woven into the
second end of the tube with portions (320) of the at least one wire extending outwardly

of the second end of the tube.
The aortic graft of claim 2, wherein the at least one wire (315) is woven into the
second end of the tube with portions (320) of the at least one wire extending inwardly

of the second end of the tube.
