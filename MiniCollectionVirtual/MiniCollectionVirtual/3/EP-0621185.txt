<ABSTRACT>
What is described is an apparatus for conveying and treating flow-media packages (2), with a feed conveyor (3, 6), two main conveying apparatuses (6), treatment stations (I, II, III...) mounted in series, a discharge conveyor and drives (10). To simplify such a conveying device and for a more reliable design, especially also by predetermining other paths of movement, in order thereby to increase the performance, provision is made, according to the invention, for the first main conveying apparatus to be a single-stage vertical conveying apparatus, the second main conveying apparatus to be a single-stage horizontal displacement apparatus (6), the two main conveying apparatuses (6) to have a common conveying position which, in the case of the vertical conveying apparatus, is the lower of two conveying positions, and for the treatment stations for filling and closing to be mounted vertically above the main conveying apparatuses (6).

<CLAIMS>
Device for conveying and processing packages for flowable media (2),
with a feeder (3, 6), two main conveying means (6, 9), processing

stations (I - XII) arranged one behind another, a discharger (61, 63), and
with drives (10, 17), wherein the first main conveying means is a single-step,

vertical conveying means (9) in the sense that a reciprocating
movement is carried out between two end positions, the second main

conveying means is a horizontal shifting means (6), both main conveying
means (6, 9) have a common conveying position, which in the case of

the vertical conveying means (9) is the lower of two conveying positions,
and wherein the processing stations (IX - XIII) for filling and closing are

arranged vertically above the second main conveying means (6, 9),
characterised in that the horizontal shifting means (6) is also single-step

in the sense that a reciprocating movement is carried out between two
positions in a horizontal plane, such that the horizontal shifting means (6)

always returns when the vertical conveying means (9) has lifted up at
least one package (2) from the lower, horizontal plane, and the package

(2) is stationary in the upper, horizontal plane, and that the vertical
conveying means (9) is provided with at least two separately driven

sections, each of which is provided with a vertically moveable bridge
(14) with at least one horizontally arranged supporting rod (15).
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that the horizontal shifting
means (6) is provided with two axially moveable guide rods (8) arranged

parallel at a distance (b) apart, each with a plurality of transversely
arranged supporting bars (24) which, at an axial distance (c) apart, lead

towards one another parallel and pair-wise in the space between the guide
rods (8), and leave a central slot (25). 
Device according to claim 1 or 2, characterised in that by means of the
axial distance (c) apart of each two adjacent supporting bars (24), a

transverse slot (26) is produced, which runs transversely with respect to
the central slot (25).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the
respective two guide rods (8) are connected by means of a drive strip

(16) running transversely between them.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterised in that the bridge
(14) is horizontal and towards the conveying direction, and that the

carrier rod (15) is arranged at a right-angle to the bridge (14).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the
vertical conveying means (9) is provided with three sections with three

bridges (14) of different lengths, that the rear bridge (14) in the entire
conveying means (X) carries two supporting rods (15), and that the

central bridge (14) carries three supporting rods (15) arranged parallel
beside one another at a distance apart.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 6, characterised in that a
supporting rod (15) is the length of several package (2) arranged one

behind another in the line.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 7, characterised in that the
bridges (14) of the vertical conveying means (9) are moveable vertically

through the central slot (25) and the supporting rods (15) are moveable
vertically through the transverse slot (26) between the supporting strips

(24).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the 
processing station (XII) is provided with a heated, substantially stationary

vacuum die (41) for closing, adjacent to which there is arranged a feeder
means (37) for intermittent advancing of foil sections, which can be

drawn in the form of a foil web (30) from a stock roll (29).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 9, characterised in that in the
area of the discharger (61, 63) there is provided a means (7) for

screwing on lids, preferably with an integrated separating means (57, 58)
for the closed packages (2), wherein a pick-up (47), rotatable about two

axes (48, 52) perpendicular to one another, takes up the separated lid
(43) and screws it onto the package (2).
Device according to one of claims 1 to 10, characterised in that on a part
of the length of the row of processing stations (I - XIII) arranged one

behind another, there is arranged a housing (65, 68) encompassing the
latter and the main conveying means (6, 9), provided with horizontally

moveable sluice modules (66, 66', 67, 67', 69) with inlet and outlet lines
for sterile gas.
Device according to claim 1, characterised in that at the level of the
processing stations (I - XIII) there is arranged in the housing (65) a row

of intensive chambers (71 - 75) arranged one behind another, and
closeable by means of moveable shutters (78).
