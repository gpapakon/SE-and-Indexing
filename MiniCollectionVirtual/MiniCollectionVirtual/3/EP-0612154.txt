<ABSTRACT>
A programmable logic device comprises a plurality of logic circuits 
interconnected through an interconnection network. Each logic circuit 

comprises an array (14) of memory cells. The memory cells are in a first 
mode of operation responsive to an address signal at the location of 

that cell to output data stored in the cell. In a second mode of 
operation the memory cells are operable to compare data input to it with 

data stored in it and to output a match signal when said input data 
matches said stored data. The programmable logic device comprises 

circuitry for operating that array of memory cells as a random access 
memory (RAM) with the cells in the first mode of operation and circuitry 

for operating that array of memory cells as content addressable memory 
(CAM) in the second mode of operation.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a programmable logic circuit,
and particularly to such a circuit which can be used to
implement a programmable logic device.Programmable logic devices (PLD) are logic devices which can
be programmed by a user to perform a specific logic function.
They generally consist of a plurality of logic function
generators which are connected one to another by an
interconnection network. Programmable logic devices are known
in which both the function generators and the interconnection
network can be programmed. The logic function generator is
commonly referred to as a unit cell, the programmable logic
device (PLD) being a regular array of said unit cells. A
number of such unit cells are known, those in common usage
being discussed below. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
is a generic term commonly used in the art for large capacity
PLDs.
1) Fixed Gates
The unit cell is a logic gate having a fixed logic function,
often a NAND gate in a CMOS device. It is known to construct
an array of such gates with a programmable interconnection
network, although the logic function of each unit is fixed.
The programmability of the interconnection network arises by
the provision of a multiplexer on the inputs of each NAND gate
so that the inputs to each NAND gate can come from any of a
number of different unit cells within the interconnection
network. The array can then be programmed by setting a state
of all of the multiplexers in the array, so that signals are
correctly routed through the array. 2) Programmable Logic Arrays (PLA)
These arrays comprise a plurality of rows of switches, each
row providing an output which is a logical OR of some of a
plurality of inputs to the switches in that row. Each row is
arranged to receive a set of inputs and their inverses. The
logic function to be implemented by the array is set by
setting the state of the switches. The same structure can
also be used to generate a logical AND function. It is known
to use a programmable logic array to provide outputs which are
used as the inputs to a second such array, and these are often
referred to as AND plane/OR plane structures.3) Look-UP Tables (LUT)
The basic unit cell for a look-up table is a small random
access memory comprising a plurality of memory cells. Inputs
to the memory provide the address for the memory, and the
output is the data read from the cell at the addressed memory
location. By storing appropriate data in the memory, it is
possible to generate any Boolean function of a number of
variables up to
