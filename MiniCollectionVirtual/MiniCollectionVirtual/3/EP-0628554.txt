<ABSTRACT>
There is described a process for the catalytic preparation of propylene glycol carbonate (PGC) by reaction of propylene oxide (POX) and CO2 in PGC as a reaction medium at elevated temperature and elevated pressure and separation of the resulting PGC from the catalyst. The process is carried out continuously with adiabatic temperature control. Per unit of time, PGC as the reaction medium runs into the reactor in a 7- to 350-fold amount of the PGC formed per unit of time. An excess of CO2 over the other reaction component POX is maintained in all parts of the reactor. 80 to 98 % by weight of the reaction mixture running out are fed back to the entrance of the reactor, while the remainder is worked up to PGC. For working up, the perceptible heat of the reaction product resulting through the adiabatic temperature control can be employed.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the catalytic preparation of propylene
glycol carbonate (PGC) by reacting propylene oxide

(POX) and carbon dioxide in PGC as reaction medium
at elevated temperature and elevated pressure and

separating off from the catalyst the PGC formed,
characterized in that


a) the process is carried out continuously and
adiabatically at a pressure of 2 to 200 bar,

preferably 5 to 80 bar, particularly
preferably 8 to 60 bar and within a

temperature range of 110 to 200째C, preferably
110 to 190째C, particularly preferably 110 to

180째C with an adiabatic temperature increase
of 2 to 80째C, the entry temperature being

selected so that the adiabatic temperature
increase remains within the temperature range

mentioned,
b) the PGC flowing into the reactor as reaction
medium per unit of time is 7 to 350 times the

PGC formed in this unit of time, 
c) 1.01 to 1.5 mol, preferably 1.01 to 1.4 mol,
particularly preferably 1.01 to 1.35 mol of

carbon dioxide are used per mole of POX and at
all points of the reactor a carbon dioxide

excess is maintained and
d) 80 to 98 % by weight, preferably 85 to 97 % by
weight, of the total reaction mixture are

returned to the entrance of the reactor and
the remainder is worked up to give PGC.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
intensive mixing is maintained in the reactor.
Process according to Claim 2, characterized in that
the reactor contains perforated trays, pipe distributors,

two-component nozzles, jet nozzles,
nozzles, closed gas distributors, impingement

aerator elements, mixer elements or a combination
of a plurality thereof.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in
that, to generate the carbon dioxide excess, at

least some of the carbon dioxide is fed into the
PGC serving as reaction medium before the injection

of the POX, this carbon dioxide being preferably
added to the PGC before entry into the reactor.
Process according to Claim 4, characterized in that
POX, alone or as a mixture with any remaining

carbon dioxide, is fed into the reactor at at least
two sequentially following points in such a way

that a carbon dioxide excess always exists. 
Process according to Claim 5, characterized in that
the excess of carbon dioxide provided is added to

the PGC before its entry into the reactor and the
remaining carbon dioxide is fed into the reactor as

an equimolar POX/CO
2
 mixture.
Process according to Claim 1, characterized in that
the sensible heat achieved of the reaction mixture

can be used for the work-up of the reaction mixture
to give PGC and/or can be used in the generation of

heating steam and/or can be used in carrying out
endothermic processes.
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in
that, in the recovery of the sensible heat, a

cooling of the reaction mixture by 2 to 80
C takes
place.
Process according to Claim 7, characterized in that
the work-up to give PGC is carried out with utilization

of the recovered sensible heat.
Process according to Claim 9, characterized in that
the work-up is carried out by distillation at 2 to

100 mbar, preferably at 4 to 90 mbar, particularly
preferably at 5 to 80 mbar.
