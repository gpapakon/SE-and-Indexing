<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is directed to solid electrolytes 
which when employed in solid, secondary electrolytic 
cells impart enhanced cumulative capacity to the cells. 
In particular, the solid electrolytes of this invention 
comprise an electrolytic solvent mixture of triglyme, 
an organic carbonate, and inorganic ion salt. Electrolytic cells comprising an anode, a cathode 
and a solid, solvent-containing electrolyte are known 
in the art and are usually referred to as "solid cells" 
or "solid batteries". These solid cells offer a number 
of advantages over electrolytic cells containing a 
liquid electrolyte (i.e., "liquid cells" or "liquid 
batteries") including improved safety features. 
Notwithstanding their advantages, the use of these 
solid cells over repeated charge/discharge cycles is 
substantially impaired because these cells typically 
exhibit significant drops in their charge and discharge 
capacity over repeated cycles as compared to their 
initial charge and discharge capacity. Specifically, solid cells employ a solid 
electrolyte interposed between a cathode and an anode. 
The solid electrolyte contains either an inorganic or 
an organic matrix as well as a suitable alkali salt. 
The inorganic matrix may be non-polymeric (e.g., β-alumina, 
silver oxide, lithium iodide, etc.) or  
 
polymeric (e.g., inorganic [polyphosphazine] polymers) 
whereas the organic matrix is typically polymeric. 
Suitable organic polymeric matrices are well known in 
the art and are typically organic polymers obtained by 
polymerization of a suitable organic monomer as 
described, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,908,283. 
Suitable organic monomers include, by way of example, 
ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, ethyleneimine, 
epichlorohydrin, ethylene succinate, urethane acrylate, 
and an acryloyl-derivatized polyalkylene oxide 
containing acryloyl group(s) of the formula 
CH2=CR'C(O)O- where R' is hydrogen or lower alkyl of 
from 1-6 carbon atoms. Because of their expense and difficulty in forming 
into a variety of shapes, inorganic non-polymeric 
matrices are generally not preferred, and the art 
typically employs a solid electrolyte containing a 
polymeric matrix. Nevertheless, electrolytic cells 
comprising a solid electrolyte containing a polymeric 
matrix suffer from low ion conductivity, and, 
accordingly, in order to maximize the conductivity of 
these materials, the matrix is generally constructed 
into a very thin film, i.e., on the order of about 25 
to about 250 µm. As is apparent, the reduced thickness 
of
