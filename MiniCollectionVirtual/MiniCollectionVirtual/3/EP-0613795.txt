pair of axially spaced bead portions (2), a pair of 

sidewalls (3) extending between the edges of the 
tread and the bead portions (2), a pair of bead 

cores ( 4) disposed one in each bead portion (2), a 
carcass (5) extending between the bead portions (2) 

through the sidewalls (3) and tread portion (1) and 
a belt (6) disposed radially outside the carcass 

(5) extending across the tread portion (1), 
wherein each sidewall is provided axially inside 

the carcass (5) with a liner packing piece (7) 
extending radially inwardly to the bead portion (2) 

and radially outwardly into the tread region (1) 
characterised in that the packing piece comprises a 

fibre-reinforced rubber composition containing 
aramid fibres in the form of short discontinuous 

fibrillated fibres.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to pneumatic tyres and in 
particular to run-flat safety tyres. In the conventional pneumatic tyre the tyre carcass 
is tensioned by the internal inflation pressure 
thus providing sufficient rigidity in the tyre 
sidewall to enable the tyre to carry load. If the 
internal pressure is lost for any reason then the 
carcass tension and thus the sidewall rigidity is 
lost and the sidewall experiences severe deflection 
which rapidly generates a large amount of heat. 
Additionally the tyre sidewalls may collapse 
completely such that the upper and lower internal 
surfaces contact and the differential slip between 
these generates frictional heat further adding to 
the temperature rise of the tyre. Thus in a very 
short time the high temperature generated degrades 
the material of the carcass and the tyre is 
destroyed. Accordingly the conventional pneumatic 
tyre has no practical run-flat capability. In order to provide run-flat performance for a  
 
pneumatic tyre various structures have been 
proposed. For example in the inner chamber formed 
by the tyre and wheelrim assembly an elastic member 
or an inflatable structure to form an independent 
air chamber have been proposed to provide load 
support in the event of tyre deflation. Such structure however have not found utility in 
the modern tyre because the weight of the tyre and 
wheelrim assembly is greatly increased whereby high 
speed performance is significantly reduced. Alternatively it has been proposed to improve the 
load bearing ability of the tyre sidewall under 
deflated conditions by increasing the thickness of 
the sidewall thereby increasing its rigidity. 
Although the run-flat capability of such tyres is 
improved their performance is limited due to the 
nature of conventional rubber compounds. 
Accordingly the necessary sidewall thickness to 
provide full load support is such that normal 
flexing as the sidewall passes through the contact 
patch generates heat which due to the poor 
conductivity of rubber is retained in the bulk of  
 
the sidewall. Thus in run-flat use the tyre is 
limited in maximum speed and range such that the 
tyre does not overheat. A high performance tyre with self-supporting 
capability is known, for example, from EP-A-0385192. 
This known tyre comprises in the sidewall 
region a lenticular shaped member of elastomeric 
material incorporating textile reinforcement cords. 
A tyre having a sidewall incorporating short fibres 
including aramid fibres is known from JP-A-2162101.
