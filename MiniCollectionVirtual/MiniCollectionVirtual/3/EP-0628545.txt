<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to prostaglandins and 
their esters. More particularly, the present invention provides 
13,14-dihydro-PGF2β and its isopropyl ester of formula: 
wherein R¹ is hydrogen or isopropyl, and their cyclodextrin 
clathrates and, when R¹ is hydrogen, its pharmaceutically 
acceptable salts. These compounds are useful for 
prevention and/or treatment of glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease caused by elevation of 
intraocular pressure. Enhancement of the illness causes 
contraction of the visual field and ultimately blindness. 
Intraocular pressure is changed by the balance of the 
secretion of aqueous humor from the ciliary body epithelium 
and its excretion from Schlemm's cannal. Imbalance causes 
elevation of intraocular pressure. Treatment for glaucoma is currently carried out by two 
different methods, i.e. by surgical operation or by 
administration of reducing agent of intraocular pressure. 
As reducing agents of intraocular pressure, miotic agents 
(pilocarpine, carbacol etc.), carbonic anhydrase inhibitors 
and β-blockers are known.  It is known that certain derivatives of prostaglandins 
(PG) possess a reducing activity of intraocular pressure 
without heavy side effects. For example, it has been disclosed that PGF2α alkyl 
esters of the formula: 
wherein RA is C1-5 alkyl, possess reducing activity of 
intraocular pressure (see Japanese Patent Kokai No. 59-1418 
or European Patent Publication No. 93,380). In this 
specification, PGF2α methyl ester, PGF2α ethyl ester, PGF2α 
isopropyl ester, PGF2α, PGF2β, 15-keto-PGF2α, 
16,16-dimethyl-PGF2α and PGF1α are specifically disclosed 
as effective PGF type compounds. It has also been disclosed that 11-epi-PGF2α alkyl and 
alkyl-aryl esters of formula: 
wherein RB is alkyl or alkyl-aryl, possess reducing 
activity of intraocular pressure (see Japanese Patent Kokai 
No. 2-501483 or European Patent Publication No. 344,235).  
 
In this specification, 11-epi-PGF2α isopropyl ester is 
specifically disclosed as an effective compound. Further, it has been disclosed that 15-acyl-PG 
derivatives of formula: 
wherein dotted lines are a bond or cis- or trans-double 
bond, AC is OH or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or 
OR5C, R1C and R2C are the following combination: -OH/-OH, 
=O/-OH or -OH/=O, R3C is non-cyclic saturated or 
unsaturated hydrocarbon of C1-20 or -(CH2)n-R4C (wherein n 
is 0-10, R4C is C3-7 aliphatic ring or aromatic or 
hetero-aromatic ring and R5C is C1-10 aliphatic group), 
possess reducing activity of intraocular pressure
