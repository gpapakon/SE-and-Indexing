<ABSTRACT>
Described is a filter for plastic melts containing impurities, the filter having a housing (1) in which a cylindrical or conical filter element (3) is mounted so that it can be rotated by a drive shaft (6) about its longitudinal axis (4). Lying against the outside surface (15) of the filter element is a scraper (20) which surrounds the filter element (3) in the form of a spiral. The material to be filtered is fed into the filter element from the outside through an inlet port (12). The filtrate passes through apertures (16) in the filter element (3) into the central cavity inside the filter element (3), from where it is removed through an outlet port (18). The impurities cannot pass through the apertures (16) in the filter element (3), but collect on the outside surface (15) of the filter element (3) and are conveyed by the fixed scraper (20) to a discharge port (24). This gives a simple design which is reliable in operation.

A filter assembly for flowable material containing solids particles, having a housing (1) 
in which there is arranged a hollow-cylindrical filtering element (3) which is axially 

symmetrical about an axis (4) and whose surface (15) is provided with a plurality of 
hole-like openings (16) for the filtrate, an inlet (12) of the housing (1) being present to 

convey the material to be filtered ― which is fed under pressure ― from the exterior of the 
surface (15) to the filtering element (3) and to convey the filtrate through the filtering 

element (3) from the exterior to an inner cavity (17) connected to an outlet (18) of the 
housing (1), on the other hand a scraper element (20) ― which is arranged coaxial with 

the filtering element (3), contacts with the exterior of the surface (15) of the filtering 
element (3), is held in the housing (1) so as to be non-rotatable and follows the curvature 

of the filtering element (3) along a coil ― being present to continuously remove the 
residues from the surface (15), so that the residues are transported through an annular 

clearance (13) located between the filtering element (3) and the housing (1) with a 
component motion directed in the axial direction of the filtering element (3) to reach a 

separate outlet (24), and the filtering element (3) being connected to a drive (6) for 
rotation about its axis (4), characterised in that the scraper element (20) for filtering 

contaminated plastic melts is divided into a plurality of segments (20') each of which is ― 
in the radial direction of the filtering element (3) ― yieldingly mounted in the housing (1) 

defining the annular clearance (13) to the exterior and each of which only contacts ― 
contact being along a spiral portion ― the filtering element (3) over a portion of the axial 

length thereof, the segments (20') however running along the single or multiple coil, and 
in that the filtering element (3) has a screen bearing body (34) through which a plurality 

of channels (35) pass and with the outer surface of which there contacts a screen disc 
(37) which is thin-walled compared with the screen bearing body (34) and whose 

numerous screen openings (38) forming the openings (16) for the filtrate have a 
substantially smaller diameter than the channels (35). 
A filter assembly in accordance with Claim 1, characterised in that the closed end face 
(5) of the filtering element (3) is connected to a shaft (9) of the drive (6), optionally via a 

coupling (10).  
 
A filter assembly in accordance with Claim 1 or 2, characterised in that the segments 
(20') are partially embedded in the wall of the housing (1). 
A filter assembly in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 3, characterised in that each 
segment (20') bears at least one radially arranged bolt (29) at its outer surface, this bolt 

(29) extending in a radial bore (30) of the housing (1) and being urged inwards by a 
spring (31) clamped between the end of this bore (30) and the end face of the bolt (29). 
A filter assembly in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 4, characterised in that a 
conveying element, in particular a screw conveyor (23), for transporting away the 

contaminants is provided in a channel (47) leading to the outlet (24), which conveying 
element is driven by the drive (6) for the filtering element (3). 
A filter assembly in accordance with Claim 5, characterised in that the screw conveyor 
(23) is formed by a portion of the driving shaft (9). 
A filter assembly in accordance with Claim 6, characterised in that the portion of the 
driving shaft (9) forming the screw conveyor (23) is surrounded by a cooling device (28). 
A filter assembly in accordance with any one of Claims 2 to 7, characterised in that the 
diameter of the driving shaft (9) connected to the closed end face (5) of the filtering 

element (3) is smaller than the external diameter of the filtering element (3). 
A filter assembly in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 8, characterised in that the 
inlet (12) of the housing (1) is provided with a widening (39) facing the filtering element 

(3), this widening (39) extending over a substantial part of the length of the filtering 
element (3) in the axial direction of the latter, preferably over at least half of its length. 
A filter assembly in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 9, characterised in that the 
channels (35) of the screen bearing body (34) widen in cross-section towards the screen 

disc (37). 
A filter assembly in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 10, characterised in that the 
screen disc (37) is shrunk onto the screen bearing body (34). 
A filter assembly in accordance with any one of Claims 1 to 11, characterised in that a 
thread, in particular of trapezoidal cross-section, or annular grooves is/are made at the 

outer surface (36) of the screen bearing body (34), and in that the screen disc (37) is  
 

secured to the crests of the thread or to the ribs remaining between the annular grooves as 
the case may be.
