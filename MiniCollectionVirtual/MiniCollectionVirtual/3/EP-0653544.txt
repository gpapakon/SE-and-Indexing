<ABSTRACT>
The rock drill has a drill head (1), a body (2) and a shank (3) opposite the drill head (1). The body (2) has at least one conveying helix (4, 5) which is penetrated by grooves (8, 9) on its back (6, 7) forming the outside diameter. The grooves (8, 9) run along planes arranged at right angles to the centre axis of the body (2).
