<ABSTRACT>
The proposed magnesium hydroxide Mg(OH)2 has a crystal size in the 
<
004

 direction greater than 150  ANGSTROM  and less than 500 ANGSTROM , an aspect ratio in the range from 2 to 5, a deformation in the

/g. The magnesium hydroxide is prepared by a two-stage synthesis: in the first stage, magnesium nitrate is treated with an alkaline compound, in particular ammonia, in an aqueous medium using a 1.5 to 6.0-fold excess, at a temperature of at most 85 DEG C and at atmospheric pressure, forming basic magnesium nitrate. The latter decomposes in the second stage at a temperature of from 110 to 150 DEG C and a pressure of up to 1.5 MPa.

.
Magnesium hydroxide according to claim 1, having
50 % secondary particles with a diameter less than 1.4

µm and 100 % secondary particles with a maximum diameter
of 4.0 µm.

/g.
Method of producing magnesium hydroxide
according to one of claims 1 to 3, accomplished in two

chlorine-free stages and from magnesite, characterised
in that, in the first stage, magnesium nitrate is acted

upon with an alkaline compound, more especially ammonia,
namely in the water medium, at a maximum temperature of

85° C and at an atmospheric pressure, the alkaline
compound, preferably ammonia, being used with a 1.5- to

6.0-times excess, and the pH of the mixture being
alkaline, and by forming a basic magnesium nitrate which

decomposes in two stages in the alkaline environment at
a temperature of between 110° C and 150° C and at a

pressure of 1.5 MPa, the application of this high
temperature lasting no longer than 4 hours. 
Method according to claim 4, characterised in
that the operation is preferably effected in the first

stage with 3.0- to 5.0-times excess ammonia, namely at a
temperature of between 50 and 75° C, the pH of the

reaction mixture being 8 to 10.
Method according to claim 4, characterised in
that the decomposition is preferably effected in the

second stage at a temperature of between 120° C and 130°
C, at a pressure of between 0.3 and 1.3 MPa and at a pH

of between 8 and 10.
