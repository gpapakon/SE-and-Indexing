<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a comb copolymer 
suitable for use as an acrylic elastomer which is 
excellent in transparency, weatherability and mechanical 
properties; to a methylmethacrylate (co)copolymer 
blended with the comb copolymer; to a comb copolymer as 
an acrylic resin which is excellent in transparency, 
weatherability, gloss and light resistance; and to a 
preparation method of a high molecular weight comb 
copolymer useful as a molding material comprising the 
above comb copolymer. Methyl methacrylate polymer and copoymers have 
been conventionally used for cast sheets, injection-molded 
articles and extruded products as resins which 
are excellent in transparency, gloss and weatherability. 
On the other hand, these resins are hard and  
 
brittle and it is hence difficult to prepare, for 
example, films and sheets from them. Consequently, the 
field of application of these resins has been limited 
until now. In order to eliminate the disadvantages of 
hardness and brittleness, various methods have been 
proposed such as a method for blending elastomers with 
the methyl methacrylate (co)polymers and a method for 
grafting methyl methacrylate on elastomers. The method 
for grafting methyl methaclrylate on the elastomers 
exhibits a particularly remarkable effect. Accordingly, 
various proposals have been made about the kinds of 
the elastomers used and the methods for graft polymerization. 
These proposals include, for example, a method 
for using diene polymers such as polybutadiene as the 
elastomers and a method for using acrylic elastomers. 
The former method, however, has a drawback in that it 
causes a severe decrease in weatherability of resulting 
polymers due to double bonds contained in the elastomers. 
The latter method is also disadvantageous in that 
a large amount of the acrylic elastomers must be used 
in order to obtain a satisfactory effect, because the 
latter method is less effective in the improvement than 
the former method, which situation inevitably leads to 
a decrease in transparency and gloss of the resulting 
polymers.  On the other hand, styrene-diene block copolymers 
and polyester-polyether block copolymers have 
already been developed for the materials of thermoplastic 
elastomers. Acrylic elastomer materials, however, 
have not yet proven satisfactory, although there has 
been a need for these materials in view of their excellent 
transparency and weatherability. In order to develop acrylic elastomers, anion 
living polymerization has also been tried as

An impact resistant acrylic resin comprising an acrylic comb copolymer 
which is prepared by copolymerizing 60 to 90 parts by weight of a methacrylic 

macromonomer having a vinyl group at one end of the main chain, a 
number average molecular weight of 3,000 to 50,000 and a glass transition 

temperature of 40°C or more, with 40 to 10 parts by weight of an acrylic ester 
having a glass transition temperature of the homopolymer of 0°C or 

less, which copolymer has a molecular weight corresponding to the peak 
top of the molecular weight distribution curve measured by the GPC method 

of 50,000 or more.
