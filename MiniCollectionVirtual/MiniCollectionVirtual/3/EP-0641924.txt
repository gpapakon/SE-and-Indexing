<ABSTRACT>
In a system for learning the fully-closed opening 
degree of a subsidiary throttle valve, if a stable state 

judging means judges that a state in which an influence is 
not exerted to the operational state of the engine (a state 

in which the vehicle is stopped and the engine is in an 
idling state) even if the subsidiary throttle valve is 

fully closed, a valve closing means closes the subsidiary 
throttle valve and a fully-closed opening degree learning 

means starts learning. If the opening degree of the 
subsidiary throttle valve or the engine revolution number 

is largely varied during the learning of the fully-closed 
opening degree learning means, a valve-closing prohibiting 

means prohibit the closing of the subsidiary throttle valve 
to
 discontinue the learning. Even if all of the conditions 
for learning are satisfied again, the closing of the 

subsidiary throttle valve and learning by the fully-closed 
opening degree learning means are prohibited until the 

comparator circuit judges that the vehicle starts traveling 
and vehicle speed exceeds a reference value.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a system for learning 
in use the fully-closed opening degree of a subsidiary throttle 
valve disposed in series with a main throttle valve mounted 
in an intake passage in an engine. For example, in an engine of a vehicle including a 
traction control device, a main throttle valve connected to 
an accelerator pedal and opened and closed by the 
accelerator pedal, and a subsidiary throttle valve 
connected to an actuator and opened and closed by the 
actuator are mounted in series. And when an excessive 
slipping of a driven wheel occurs, the subsidiary throttle 
valve is controlled to be closed, thereby reducing the 
output from the engine to suppress the excessive slipping. To accurately control the opening degree of the 
subsidiary throttle valve, it is necessary to correctly 
detect the opening degree of the subsidiary throttle valve. 
For this purpose, a system for learning the fully-opened 
opening degree of the subsidiary throttle valve has been 
proposed (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-open 
No.107926/81). This prior art system is designed such that 
when the actuator for opening and closing the subsidiary  
 
throttle valve is in a non-energized state and the 
subsidiary throttle valve is in a fully opened state, the 
fully opened degree is learned by detecting it by a sensor 
and storing it. The subsidiary throttle valve is normally in an opened 
state and is closed when the traction control device is 
operated. However, the important opening degree of the 
subsidiary throttle valve for suppressing the excessive 
slipping of the driven wheel, is near a substantially 
fully-closed opening degree. For this reason, the system 
for learning the fully-closed opening degree of the 
subsidiary throttle valve as in the prior art is 
accompanied by a problem that it is impossible to carry out 
an effective learning. In order to avoid such disadvantage, it may be 
conceived that the fully-closed opening degree of the 
subsidiary throttle valve should be learned. However, if 
the subsidiary throttle valve is closed into a fully-closed 
state, an influence is exerted to the operational state of 
the engine and hence, it is necessary to learn the fully-closed 
opening degree while selecting a particular 
operational state (e.g., an idling state) in which such 
influence is minimized. However, even if all of a plurality 
of conditions in which the engine is in the above-described 
particular operational state are satisfied and the 
subsidiary throttle valve is closed
