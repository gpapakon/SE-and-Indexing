<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a nonvolatile
semiconductor memory, and a test method for the same.
Further, the invention relates to a semiconductor
memory having a sense amplifier, and a semiconductor
device. More particularly, the invention relates to a
semiconductor device and a test method for the same,
wherein testing can be conducted easily to check whether
the fabricated semiconductor device has a prescribed
performance.Semiconductor memories such as DRAM and SRAM are
widely used, and flash memory has been attracting
attention as an electrically erasable nonvolatile memory.
Each memory cell of a flash memory consists of a single
transistor. This transistor is called a memory cell
transistor. A memory cell transistor of the flash
memory has the structure of an n-channel MOS transistor
with a floating gate formed beneath its gate. For
erasure, a control gate is left open, and a high voltage
is applied to a source, which causes a charge to be
drawn through the source, leaving almost zero charge on
the floating gate. In this situation, when an
appropriate voltage is applied to the control gate, the
transistor conducts. When a high voltage is applied to
the control gate and the drain, avalanche breakdown
occurs, and part of electrons that have gained high
energy near the drain are captured by the floating gate.
This operation is called writing. Once writing is
done, the charge remains accumulated on the floating
gate, so that the transistor will not conduct even when
a voltage is applied to the control gate. Data is
defined according to whether the transistor conducts or 
not. In the flash memory, the writing and erasure of
information can be accomplished electrically, as
described above.Flash memories require different voltages for
different operating modes, read, write, and erasure,
for application to various elements, and accordingly,
their control operations are complex: Furthermore, a
read or erase operation is usually followed by a verify
operation to verify the processed data by reading it.
Such operations have previously been done by applying
prescribed voltages to designated terminals of the flash
memory by using a writer or other external equipment.
This puts a great deal of load on the writer and other
external equipment used for write and erase operations.
To simplify such complex control algorithms, the
recent flash memory design incorporates automatic
circuitry that allows the writing and erasure of flash
memory cells to be accomplished just by entering simple
control commands from the
