<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention pertains to Doppler detector systems, particularly 
to laser Doppler homodyne interferometers. More particularly, the present invention 
pertains to a solid-block homodyne interferometer. Numerous homodyne interferometers in laser Doppler systems utilizing 
polarization beamsplitters and Brewster plates, have been known for some time. Such 
an interferometer typically uses several mirrors and beamsplitters with one or more 
fractional waveplates. The disadvantages of such conventional systems include 
tedious alignment required for the mirrors and beamsplitters, sensitivity to vibration 
which reduces accuracy of detection, the cumbersome size due to the numerous 
mirrors and beamsplitters, and moderate efficiency. French documents FR-A-2 556 841 and FR-A-2 582 807 disclose 
interferometers having a plurality of beamsplitters and mirrors. The latter 
document discloses a cube-type beamsplitter and reflecting prism. The U.S. government may have certain rights in the subject invention. The present invention eliminates the need for individually supported 
mirrors and beamsplitters. In lieu of such mirrors and beamsplitters, a glass prism 
block is used having two 90 degree prisms and an etalon. This interferometer derives 
a local oscillator signal of an appropriate strength and provides a transmit-receive 
switch of high efficiency which is achieved via polarization coatings on the etalon. 
Due to the precise tolerances on the angles of the prisms and etalon, the back 
scattered beam (signal beam) is spatially congruent with the local oscillator signal or 
beam, thus assuring a high mixing efficiency. Both prisms and the etalon are epoxied 
together to eliminate any air interface among them. The advantages of the present invention are that alignment requirements 
are eliminated, there is suitability in high gravity-environments, there is high 
efficiency (i.e., 97-98%), and adaptability for both continuous-wave and pulse-wave  
 
Doppler systems. The invention is applicable to optical air data systems, wind shear 
detection using Rayleigh scattering, and wing vortex detection at airports. Figure 1 is a diagram of the basic solid-block interferometer utilizing 
continuous-wave beam technology. Figure 2 is a diagram of the solid-block utilized in the interferometer. Figure 3 is a diagram of the solid-block interferometer utilizing pulse-wave 
light beam technology. Figure 4 is the solid-block layout for the pulse-wave version of the 
interferometer. Figure 5 is a diagram of the
