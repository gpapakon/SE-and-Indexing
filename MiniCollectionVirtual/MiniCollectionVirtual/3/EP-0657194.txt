<ABSTRACT>
It comprises a vehicle (1) including a receiver circuit 
which may be enabled by the electromagnetic signal 

emitted by a remote control (17), handled by an adult, 
and a pushbutton (15), in series with the motor (19), to 

be depressed by the child driving the vehicle. A switch 
(14) breaks the supply to the receiver circuit, disabling 

it, at the same time as it makes a bridge across the 
power supply and the child operated pushbutton (15). 
The invention is applicable to children's toy vehicles 
driven by very young children, so that an adult located 

remotely can break the motor supply to stop the vehicle 
at any given time, for safety purposes.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a child's toy vehicle having a
safety device which provides for the function to which it
is directed several advantages to be listed hereinafter,
apart from others inherent in its organization and
constitution.Already known in the state of the art are toy vehicles
prepared for carrying a child who becomes himself the
driver, with complete independence of control. The said
vehicles are of the type comprising an electric motor, a
power supply formed by dry or wet batteries and an
electrical circuit including an easily accessible
pushbutton closing the said motor supply circuit.As said above, in this type of vehicle the child is
completely independent to drive and steer the vehicle in
which he is travelling, with the risks inherent thereto.
This is why this type of vehicle is for children of a
certain age, approximately from four years upwards, but
they are not appropriate for younger children, of ages
ranging from one to three years, since their lack of
driving skill could cause them problems and slight
accidents which, although not representing a serious
risk, must be avoided so as not to upset the child's
emotional state. GB-A-1 239 925 discloses a vehicle used for amusement
purpose and also suitable for children that, when in use,
operate within a predetermined area or along a predetermined
track, and transmitter means including a loop aerial
circumscribing or lying within the area or lying
across the track as the case may be, and feed means for
causing radiation of an electro-magnetic signal from the
aerial to all points within the loop, each vehicle having
a prime mover, driver-operable steering means, driver-operable
speed control means, a receiver, receiver-operable
control means which is in either an operative
state or an inoperative state determined solely by said
signal and irrespective of the position of the receiver
within said loop. The solution discloses a motor control
by means of a relay, controlled by a driver operable
switch and a receiver output switch.Thus, in the present state of the art, there is no
child's toy vehicle which, while being capable of being
driven by the child himself, includes a safety device
remote controlled by an adult, through which the motor 
supply may be cut to stop the vehicle at any one time, to
avoid risks that the child has no faculties to foresee or
avoid, said device also serving to reconnect the motor
supply when the risk situation has been averted.The present applicant has devised a child's toy vehicle
including a safety device,
</DESCRIPTION>
<CLAIMS>
A child's toy vehicle (1) having a safety device, of the
type comprising a rolling structure having a seat (3) for the

child, an electric motor (9), a power supply formed by dry or
wet cells and a handlebar or steering wheel (4) operated by

the child himself, the vehicle
comprising in the structure thereof a receiver circuit (5-6-7),

powered by the power supply, said receiver circuit (5-6-7) being
enabled by the electromagnetic signal emitted by an

emitter device or remote control (17) handled by an adult, the vehicle
is

characterized in that
there being arranged at the outlet of the receiver

circuit (5-6-7) in series with the motor (9) a pushbutton (15) the control
of which is located in an easily accessible position for

operation by the child himself for starting the motor (9),
causing the vehicle (1) which he is driving to move, provided

that the receiver circuit (5-6-7) is enabled by the remote
control (17) handled by the adult, whereby

between the
power supply (8) and the receiver circuit (5-6-7) and motor start

pushbutton (15) there is a switch (14) for functional selection of
the toy, the control of which is outside the vehicle for

operation to set the switch (14) optionally in a receiver
circuit supply position or in a second position breaking

such supply, the said receiver circuit (5-6-7) being disabled in
this latter case, the switch acting as a bridge between

the power supply and the motor start pushbutton (15) to be
operated by the child.
