<ABSTRACT>
A vessel having a plurality of chambers for use mainly in 
the medical field, wherein the interior of the main body of a flexible 

plastic vessel is partitioned into a plurality of chambers by use 
of a partitioning means permitting suitable communication between 

the chambers, out of respective vessel portions of the main 
body of the plastic vessel, which constitute the plurality of chambers, 

at least one vessel portion has no cover and at least another 
vessel portion has a cover, said cover covering the peripheral surface 

of said vessel portion through a tightly sealed space portion 
and being formed of flexible film having moisture-proof and gas 

barrier properties, so that the easily disposable vessel having the 
plurality of chambers, which is inexpensive and high in quality 

and performance can be provided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to containers having a
plurality of chambers chiefly for use in the field of
medicine, and more particularly to flexible containers of
plastics having a plurality of chambers for accommodating
liquid preparations, powder preparations or solid
preparations, and partition means dividing the container
into the chambers and permitting communication between the
chambers when required.Flexible containers of plastics have heretofore been
used in the field of medicine which have a plurality of
chambers, and partition means dividing the container into
the chambers and permitting communication between the
chambers. Since such a container is likely to permit
penetration of moisture or gas even if in a very small
amount, there arises a need to place the container, along
with a desiccant, into an expensive outer bag having
barrier properties against moisture and gas when the
container is used for separately preserving an antibiotic
or like medicinal which is hygroscopic and becomes unstable
with time, and a liquid preparation such as physiological
saline, glucose or like solution or dilution. 
Nevertheless, the desiccant, which absorbs water from the
liquid preparation, fails to fully dry up the hygroscopic
medicinal and further causes concentration of the liquid
preparation. Because of this drawback, it has not been
practice to preserve the hygroscopic and unstable
antibiotic or like medicinal and the liquid preparation as
separately accommodated in the flexible container of
plastics.For this reason, medicinals, such as antibiotics,
which become unstable with time are preserved in moisture- and
gas-impermeable vials or like containers before use.
When to be administered to the patient, the medicinal
is mixed or diluted with, or dissolved in, physiological
saline, glucose solution or like dissolving liquid or
diluent which is preserved separately.However, this method is cumbersome to practice and
involves the hazard of contamination with bacteria during
the handling procedure. Containers have therefore been
developed which comprise a glass vial having enclosed
therein an unstable antibiotic and a dissolving
liquid-containing flexible container portion of plastics
joined to the vial in combination therewith, with a
piercing needle provided therebetween (see, for example,
Unexamined Japanese Patent Publication HEI 2-1277). These
containers have the advantage that the contents can be 
mixed together with ease aseptically, whereas difficulties
are encountered in discarding the container

<CLAIMS>
A container having a plurality of chambers (1A,1B) for
accommodating a liquid, powder or solid preparation

(10,11) and partition means dividing the container
into the chambers and permitting communication between

the chambers when required, the container comprising a
flexible body (1) made of plastics and having container

portions which form said plurality of chambers
(1A,1B), at least one (1A) but not all of said chambers (1A, 1B) being

enclosed within a cover (5) made of a flexible film
(6) having moisture- and gas-barrier properties to

form a closed space (7) around said covered chamber(s)
(1A), said closed space (7) containing an inert

gas and/or dry gas but not accommodating a desiccant
and/or an oxygen absorber, the other chamber(s) (1B)

being coverless.
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the partition
means is formed by at least one weak seal portion

(8a,8b) easily openable by pressing the chamber (1A,
1B) to give an increased internal pressure.
A container as defined in claim 2 wherein at least two
weak seal portions (8a,8b) are provided at a spacing

(9), and the cover (5) has a heat-sealed edge (6c)
between the adjacent weak seal portions.
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the covered
chamber (1A) has accommodated therein a liquid, powder

or solid preparation (10,11) susceptible to oxidation
and/or hygroscopic. 
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the weak
seal portion or portions (8a,8b) are formed by directly heat-sealing

together opposed inner surfaces of a flexible
plastics film (3) forming the container body (1).
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the weak
seal portion or portions (8a,8b) are formed by heat-sealing

together opposed inner surfaces of a flexible plastics film (3)
forming the container body (1), with an insert film held

between the opposed inner surfaces.
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the
container body (1) is formed of a flexible plastics film (35)

comprising an outer layer (31) of linear low-density
polyethylene, an intermediate layer (33) of resin mixture of

linear low-density polyethylene and ethylene/Î±-olefin
elastomer, and an inner layer (34) of resin mixture of linear

low-density polyethylene and polypropylene.
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the cover (5)
comprises a layer of silica-deposited resin film.
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the cover (5)
comprises an outer layer (43) of biaxially oriented polyethylene

terephthalate film, an intermediate layer (44) of silica-deposited
polyvinyl alcohol film, and an inner layer (45) of

low-density polyethylene.
A container as defined in claim 1 wherein the
cover (5) has an outer surface provided by an aluminum-laminated 

film.
A container as defined in claim 4 wherein the
substance (10,11) susceptible to oxidation and/or hygroscopic is an

antibiotic.
