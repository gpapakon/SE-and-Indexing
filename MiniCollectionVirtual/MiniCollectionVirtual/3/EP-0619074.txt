<ABSTRACT>
An antimicrobially effective solution especially suitable for 
use in baby wipes, can be antimicrobially effective against 

bacteria, yeasts and molds if the solution contains a 
phospholipid and sufficient sorbic acid and/or benzoic acid 

to provide a pH from about 3.5 to about 7. Wet wipes 
preserved with such a solution are also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
Wet wipes of various types are well known products useful for 
a variety of purposes. The solutions incorporated into these 
products usually contain a number of ingredients intended to 
enhance or impart particular properties to the product. 
These properties may relate to, for example, cleaning 
efficacy, fragrance, medication, reduced irritation, and the 
like. For baby wipes in particular, a solution providing a gentle 
soothing feel while maintaining bactericidal efficacy is 
highly desireable for product performance. To date, 
achieving such product performance has been approached with 
the use of what could be classified as synthetic ingredients, 
as opposed to natural ingredients. While natural or 
naturally-based ingredients have been used in the personal 
care industry for many years because of their perceived 
ability to enhance skin health, an inherent difficulty with 
natural ingredients is that they are often unstable and prone 
to degradation as a function of time and temperature. In 
addition, natural preservatives fall short of providing the 
wide spectrum of effectiveness for use as a baby wipe. Hence there is a need for an antimicrobially effective 
solution suitable for use in a baby wipe and for a wet wipe 
having natural or naturally-based ingredients which provides 
cleansing capability, soothes and protects the skin, and 
which provides an appropriate antimicrobial activity required 
for cosmetic products with a minimal number of ingredients. These objects are solved by the antimicrobially effective 
solution of any one of independent claims 1 or 4 and the 
preserved wet wipe of any one of independent claims 9 or 11. 
Further advantageous features, aspects and details of the  
 
invention are evident from the dependent claims, the 
description and the examples. The claims are intended to be understood as a first non-limiting 
approach of defining the invention in general terms. The invention is based on the findings that a wet wipe can be 
provided with an improved soothing feel using naturally-derived 
ingredients with adequate antimicrobial 
effectiveness. The invention according to a specific aspect 
resides in a wet wipe comprising a sheet substrate containing 
a solution, said solution comprising effective amounts of a 
phospholipid and one or more preservatives selected from the 
group consisting of sorbic acid, benzoic acid, salts of 
sorbic acid, and salts of benzoic acid, said solution having 
a pH of from about 3.5 to about 7, preferably from about 4 to 
about 6, and

1 to 6 wherein the phospholipid is a linoleamidopropyl 

phospholipid.

comprising a sheet substrate containing an aqueous 

solution according to any one of the preceding claims. 
The wet wipe of Claim 9 wherein the amount of solution is 
from 300 to 500 weight percent, based on the weight of 

the sheet substrate. 
An antimicrobially effective wet wipe comprising a 
nonwoven sheet substrate and from 300 to 500 weight 

percent of an aqueous solution, based on the weight of 
the sheet substrate, said solution having a pH of from 4 

to about 6 and comprising from 1 to 3 weight percent 
phospholipid and from 0.1 to 0.3 weight percent, 

preferably 0.1 to 0.2 weight percent sorbic acid, based 
on the weight of the solution.
