<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a valve for protecting against pressure waves in order to prevent unacceptable air pressures entering vehicles. Valves for protecting against pressure waves serve, in high speed trains, to prevent pressure surges resulting from trains passing one another, travelling through tunnels and the like from affecting the passengers unpleasantly by rapidly closing the fresh air vents. The invention disclosed in Claim 1 is based on the problem of providing a valve for protecting against pressure waves which ensures high functional reliablility despite the aforesaid environmental influences and at the same time ensures that the fresh air which is to be fed to the passengers in accordance with hygiene regulations is controlled. This problem is solved by the measures of Claim 1. Advantageous refinements of the invention are disclosed in Claims 2 to 6.

<CLAIMS>
Pressure wave valve for vehicles, which 
comprises a valve body, which is tightly connected to 

the vehicle configuration and has apertures disposed at 
predetermined spacings from one another, characterized 

in that sealing profiles (3) are disposed on an 
actuating linkage (4) facing each aperture (10), the 

actuating linkage (4) being displaceably connected to 
the valve body (1) via an adjustable pneumatic actuating 

cylinder (7). 
Pressure wave valve according to claim 1, 
characterised in that the sealing profiles (3) have 

rounded surfaces and are formed from a resilient 
material. 
Pressure wave valve according to claims 1 and 2, 
characterised in that the sealing profiles (3) are 

connected to the actuating linkage (4). 
Pressure wave valve according to claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that the sealing profiles (3) are 

connected to the actuating linkage (4) by a resilient 
element (5). 
Pressure wave valve according to claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that an eccentric engine unit (8, 9) 

and/or a controlled linear drive (11) and/or an 
ele
ctronic range detector (12) are provided to adjust 
the piston rod range of the actuating cylinder (7). 
Pressure wave valve according to claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that the sealing profiles (3) are  

 
actuated individually or in groups to regulate the 

quantity of fresh air.
