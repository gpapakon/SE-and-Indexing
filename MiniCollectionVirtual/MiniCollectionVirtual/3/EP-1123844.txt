<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a steering assist apparatus,
and more particularly to an apparatus for assisting a steering wheel
operation in parking.Conventionally, an apparatus has been proposed which displays
a rear side view of a vehicle on a monitor in the case where the target
place is out of sight from a driver due to the dead angle of the vehicle
when the vehicle reverses. For example, Japanese Patent Examined
Publication No. 2-36417 discloses a rear view monitoring apparatus for
a vehicle which comprises a television camera for picking up a rear view
of the vehicle, a monitor television set for imaging an image picked
up by the camera, a sensor for outputting an information signal related
to a tire steering angle and a circuit for generating a marker signal
in response to the information signal from this sensor and superimposing
the marker on the television image field. In this apparatus, the tire
steering angle data and the marker position data along the reverse
direction of the vehicle corresponding to its steering angle are stored
in a ROM, and a predicted reverse locus of the vehicle in correspondence
with the steering angle at that time is superimposed and displayed on
the image picked up by the television camera on the television view field
as a row of the markers.By such an apparatus, since the predicted reverse locus of the
vehicle in correspondence with the steering angle together with the view
field of the conditions of the road on the rear side is shown on the
image field of the monitor television when the vehicle reverses, the
driver may reverse the vehicle by manipulating the steering wheel while
watching the television image field without looking back. However, such a conventional apparatus is simply an apparatus
that shows the relationship between a hindrance on the rear side of the
vehicle and the predicted reverse locus by showing the predicted reverse
locus of the vehicle and provides reference information to the driver
as to whether the vehicle may avoid the hindrance or not.In the case where the vehicle is to be parked in parallel, parking
the vehicle suitably in a parking space without finely adjusting the
steering wheel steering amount during the reverse motion leads to the
possibility that the driver may park the vehicle in parallel with paying
his or her attention to the outside of the vehicle without being nervous
about the steering wheel operation. This is one of the important
advantages for the suitably parking the vehicle in parallel. However,
the conventional rear

A steering assist apparatus comprising:


a camera for picking up the rear side of a vehicle;
a monitor disposed in a driver's compartment of the vehicle;
a steering angle sensor for detecting a steering angle of a
steering wheel; and
a display controlling means for, when the vehicle reverses,
displaying on said monitor an image by said camera and in the superimposed

manner displaying on said monitor a guide display for assisting the drive
of the vehicle in parking,
said guide display including a steering start guide line fixedly
displayed in a predetermined position of an image field of said monitor

for guiding a steering start position for parking, and a steering amount
guide mark displayed movably along said steering start guide line on
