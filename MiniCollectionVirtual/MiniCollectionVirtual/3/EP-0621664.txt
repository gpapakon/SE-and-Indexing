<ABSTRACT>
A power source for a laser flash lamp (2) contains a rapid switch (6) and a controller (10) which modulates the amplitude of each individual pulse at a predeterminable modulation frequency (Mf) and depth of modulation (MT). In this way, high peak powers can be achieved with unaltered mean power of the individual pulses, with the result that in the treatment of materials the necessary threshold values can be better exceeded. Also, by means of the amplitude modulation of the individual pulses, the formation of an undesired screening plasma above the treatment location is suppressed.

<CLAIMS>
Current supply means for a laser flash lamp (2) which is 
connected to a constant voltage source with a charging capacitor 

(1) and provides current pulses of a certain duration 
and amplitude, characterized by a fast switch (6) and control 

means (10) for adjusting a depth of modulation (M
T
) and/or a 
modulating frequency (M
f
) in addition to the mean pulse 
height and the pulse duration.
