<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a charging
member for charging a member to be charged such as a
photosensitive member or a dielectric member,
to a process cartridge and to an
image forming apparatus.In a conventional contact charging device, a
charging member supplied with a voltage is contact to
an image bearing member (photosensitive drum), so as
to directly transfer the electric charge to the
photosensitive drum to electrically charge the surface
thereof to a predetermined potential. As compared
with a corona discharging device widely used as a
charging device, the contact charging device is
advantageous in that the voltage required for
providing a predetermined potential of the
photosensitive drum surface is low, that amount of
ozone production by the charging step is so small that
the necessity for an ozone removing filter is
eliminated, in that air discharging system
construction is simplified, in that the charging
device is maintenance free, and in that the structure
is simple.In an image forming apparatus such as an 
electrophotographic apparatus (copying machine), laser
beam printer or electrostatic recording apparatus, the
contact charging device is particularly noted and
practically used as a means to replace the corona
discharging device to charge an image bearing member
such as a photosensitive member or dielectric member,
or another photosensitive drum.In the contact charging device or method, an
AC biased DC oscillating voltage is applied to the
contact charging member to provide uniform potential,
and the contact charging member thus supplied with the
voltage is contacted to the photosensitive drum.If the charging roller is too hard,
the charging region between the charging roller
and the photosensitive drum becomes too small with the
result that the photosensitive drum is not
sufficiently charged.When the charging member is supplied with the
oscillating voltage for the purpose of uniform
charging of the photosensitive drum, the following
problem arises. A solid charging
roller, having a high degree of hardness, produces
charging noise by the charging roller beating on the
photosensitive drum.The causes of the charging noise will be
described, taking an example of a laser bean printer
using a charging roller. The mechanism of the noise 
production is illustrated in Figure 14. In Figure 14,
(a) is a photosensitive drum, where 1a designates a
photosensitive layer, 1b, a base layer of aluminum
electrically grounded. It is rotated at a peripheral
speed of 40 mm/sec.Since the metal core 12a
