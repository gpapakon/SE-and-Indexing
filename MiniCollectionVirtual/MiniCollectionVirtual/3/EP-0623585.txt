<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for
producing amines, and more particularly, to a process for
producing amines by carrying out a reductive amination of a
cyclic ketone or by carrying out a reduction of an imino
derivative of a cyclic ketone to the corresponding amine
which comprises using a cobalt catalyst containing a
carbonate of an alkaline earth metal and/or lanthanum
oxide.Amines are useful as intermediates for fine chemicals
and raw materials for resins, and are well known to be
produced by a reductive amination of a cyclic amine or by
reduction of an imino derivative of a cyclic ketone.For example, for the production of 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexylamine
(IPDA) by a reductive
amination of 3-cyano-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexanone (IPCN),
the following processes have been known:
(1) a cobalt catalyst supported on silicic acid is
used (BP 972010) and(2) a Raney-cobalt catalyst is used (Japanese Patent
62-123154A).
Also, as processes for producing IPDA by reducing an
imino derivative of IPCN, the following processes have been
known:(3) a cobalt catalyst is used (USP 4429157) and(4) a ruthenium catalyst supported on alumina is used
(Japanese Patent 4-221350A).However, the yield of the amine to be produced is not
sufficiently high in any of the processes mentioned above,
and thus, improvement in the yield has been desired. EP-A-0534449 discloses a process for the preparation of
a 3-aminomethyl-3,5,5-trialkylcyclohexylamine, which
comprises hydrogenating 3-cyano-3,5,5-trialkylcyclohexanone
in the presence of ammonia and a ruthenium-cobalt catalyst.
The metallic components of the catalyst may be supported on
an inorganic porous carrier by impregnating the inorganic
porous carrier with the metallic components and then fixing
the material. The fixing can be effected by treating the
carrier in an alkaline solution or by calcining the carrier
in an atmosphere of an oxygen-containing gas such as air.As a result of the diligent research on catalysts to
develop a more excellent process for producing amines, it has
now been found that a specific cobalt catalyst containing a
carbonate of an alkaline earth metal and/or lanthanum oxide
not only increases the yield of amines but also exhibits a
high catalyst activity to efficiently provide amines with a
small amount of a catalyst, and as a result of further study,
the present invention was accomplished.An object of the present invention is to provide a
process which is excellent in commercial scale for producing
an amine by carrying out a reductive
