<ABSTRACT>
A bandpass microwave filter (32) is constructed by use 
of a right cylindrical cavity resonator (10) wherein end 

regions (22, 24) of the resonator are tapered. The 
tapering is accomplished by replacing end portions of a 

right cylindrical sidewall with frusto-conic sections (22, 
24) of side wall. Each frusto-conic section joins a 

central cylindrical section (26) of the sidewall with a 
planar end wall (14, 16). Each of the end walls is 

provided with a coupling slot (28, 30) having dimensions 
substantially smaller than a half wavelength of the center 

resonant frequency of the resonator so as to be a 
nonresonant slot. The slots in the end walls may be 

coupled to rectangular waveguides (34, 36) which form input 
and output ports by which electromagnetic signals are 

applied to and extracted from the resonator.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to microwave filters and, more
particularly, to a filter constructed as a cylindrical
cavity with conically tapered end portions to provide a
resulting resonator which is a cascade of two conical
sections joined by a cylindrical section. The resulting
filter provides increased bandwidth and reduced spurious
response.Microwave filters are employed widely in
electromagnetic communication systems. For example, in
satellite communication systems, the filters are used to
define up-link and down-link communication channels. High
Q microwave filters in the 3.7 - 4.2 GHz frequency range
are currently constructed using TE111 cylindrical mode
resonators. For certain applications, it is desirable to
extend the passband down to 3.4 GHz.A problem arises in that the presently available
cylindrical resonator operating in the TE111 mode does not
function adequately well over the entire band of 3.4 - 4.2
GHz band due to the presence of extraneous TM modes which
resonate within the band. This results in a degradation of
filter performance. As a result of this limitation,
previous C-band work in the 3.4 - 4.2 GHz frequency range
could be accomplished with a TE111 resonator only by
dividing up the band into two sub-bands which might then be
diplexed together, thereby to avoid the TM mode
interference. However, such utilization of the resonator
is not available in a communication situation requiring
continuous use of the entire frequency band. Use of the
entire frequency band requires that the resonator be free
of a spurious mode over the entire band. A microwave cavity resonator with a cylindrical shaped cavity with an aspect ratio for
three modes of operation is known from IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and
Techniques, Vol. 32, No. 11, November 1984, New York, U.S., pages 1449 to 1454,
