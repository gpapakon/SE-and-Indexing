<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention generally relates to a
braking apparatus and method for use with a moving
machine. The present invention particularly relates
to a braking apparatus and method which slows down a
moving machine by neutralizing an associated
hydrostatic transmission prior to actuating a
conventional brake system of the machine.Many earth moving machines, such as front
end loaders, employ a hydrostatic transmission for
propulsion. However, it is also known that operating
the hydrostatic transmission in a certain manner can
assist in braking or stopping the machine. One such
method incorporates an "inching valve" in fluid
communication with the hydrostatic transmission. When
activated the "inching valve" bleeds off a volume of
hydrostatic fluid from the hydrostatic transmission,
which in turn causes a temporary reduction in a
hydrostatic control pressure of the system. This
decrease in control pressure causes an appropriate
controller component to "destroke" or neutralize the
hydrostatic transmission. A hydrostatic transmission
in a "destroked" or neutralized mode delivers a reduced
amount of driving force to the machines wheels, and
thus assists in braking or stopping the machine. One prior art approach to coordinate an
"inching valve's" function (and therefore a
"destroking" of the hydrostatic transmission) with a
conventional braking system of a machine has been to
mechanically link the "inching valve" to a separate
braking element, such as a piston in the master
cylinder of a hydraulic braking system. This
mechanical linkage allows the "inching valve" to
become activated upon actuation of the braking
element. However, this approach has the disadvantage
of requiring precise tolerances between the parts
mechanically interposed between the "inching valve"
and the braking element to ensure that the destroking
function is initiated before a set of brake pads or
shoes engage a disk or drum of the braking system. If
the timing is not appropriately set by the mechanical
linkage, for example if the "destroking" function
occurs at a point in time slightly after actuation of
the braking system, the hydrostatic transmission will
be operating to propel the machine forward at the same
time the braking system is attempting to slow down the
machine. The situation results in excessive brake pad
wear and deterioration. An additional disadvantage of
utilizing a mechanically linked "inching valve" is
'that it requires additional parts to link the
elements. These additional parts add unnecessary bulk
and cost to the

A braking apparatus (5) for neutralizing a hydrostatic
transmission (10), the apparatus having

   a brake cylinder (108) having a first opening (110) in
fluid communication with a signal line (30) of said

hydrostatic transmission (10) and a second opening (112) in
fluid communication with a tank (32), said first opening

said brake cylinder (108) and said second opening (112)

being arranged to allow the flow of fluid to exit said
brake cylinder (108); a movable member (114) positioned

within said brake cylinder (108) which prevents fluid
communication between the first opening (110) and the

second opening (112) when located in a first position, and
allows fluid communication between the first opening (110)

and the second opening (112) when located in a second
position; 
characterised in that

moving object (126).

said brake cylinder (108) is in fluid communication
with a brake chamber (118) having said brake member (120)

located therein; and
movement of said movable member (114) from the first
position to the second position raises fluid pressure

said brake member is a brake pad (120);
said moving object is a brake disk (126); and
said movable member is a piston (114).
The braking apparatus (5) of any of claims 1 to 3,
wherein said movable member (114) has a channel (116)

defined therein which aligns with the first opening (112)
so as to enable the flow of fluid to transverse the channel
