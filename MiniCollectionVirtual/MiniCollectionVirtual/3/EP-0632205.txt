<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an automatically adjusting device 
for joining two parts without clearance or mutual 

compressive stress, whereby the distance between the fixing 
points of the parts can vary, and the location of the 

surfaces to be joined can vary in relation to the fixing 
points. The device comprises a first part (1) attached to 

the first part to be joined, a tubular part (8) attached to 
the first part (1), a cylindrical part (3) axially adaptable 

within the tubular part (8) and having a central axial bore 
(13) to receive a screw (11), with which the second part (2) 

through a fixing hole in it is fixed to the first part (1) 
via said cylindrical part (3), whereby the cylindrical part 

(3) and the corresponding tubular part (8) have radial 
mutually interleaved projections, whereby said projections 

of the first part (3, 8) comprise cutting profiles (5), 
which comprise several circumferential sharp blades located 

at certain distances and provided with sharp outer edges and 
which cut into the projections (9) of the second part (3, 8) 

as the cylindrical part (3) tends to rotate with the screw 
(11) at the of the cylindrical part's (3) axial movement 

caused by the screw (11).

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to an automatically adjusting device 
for joining two items without clearance or mutual 
compressive stress, whereby the distance between the fixing 
points of the items and their mutual location can vary. The device according to the invention adjusts automatically 
so that the distance between the items to be joined can 
vary, whereby the device adjusts to a suitable length 
without additional means. The device can also prevent 
compression stress between the items. The device is further 
formed so that the items to be joined can be at a varying 
mutual distance from the fixing points. The patent FI 86572 (EP-A-0302026) discloses an automatically adjusting 
device for locking two parts to each other when the distance 
between the fixing points can vary. The device of this 
patent comprises a tubular part 14 and a cylindrical part 26 
which slides but cannot rotate within the part 14. This 
patent uses flexible means 40, 52, with the aid of which the 
part 26 can be lifted against the support 12. The parts to 
be joined are fixed by a screw 38 providing the joint 
between the parts 26 and 14. The device according to this 
patent is complex and contains many separate parts, so 
that it is expensive and difficult to manufacture. The device according to the invention is simple, durable and 
advantageous to manufacture. The device can obviate problems 
relating to joints, in which the surfaces to be joined are 
located outside the fixing point and in which the fixing 
points are located at different distances from the surfaces. 
This situation is illustrated in figure 1, to which we 
return later. The device according to the invention was developed mainly 
to fasten the picture tube of a television or of a monitor 
to its housing, but this device can also be applied to other  
 
types of joints and in other technical fields. The characteristics of the invention are 
presented in the enclosed claims. The invention is described in more detail below with 
reference to the figures, in which: 
figure 1 shows the device according to the invention in a 
side sectional elevation at the joint between parts 1 and 2; figure 2 shows the device according to the invention in a 
side sectional elevation in the locking position; figure 3 shows the part 3 of the device according to the 
invention; and figure 4 shows an embodiment of the parts 8 and 9 of the device 
according to the invention as seen from above. The object is to join the surfaces Q1 and Q2 shown in figure 
1 with the aid of the device

<CLAIMS>
Automatically adjusting device for locking two items to 
each other, whereby the items have fixing points, the 

distance between which can vary, and whereby the items have 
parts (1,2) with surfaces to be joined, the location of which can vary in 

relation to the fixing points, the device comprising a first 
part (1) attached to the first item to be joined, a tubular 

part (8) attached to the first part (1), a cylindrical part 
(3) axially movable within the tubular part (8) and having 

a central axial bore (13) to receive a screw (11), with 
which the second part (2) through a fixing hole in it is 

fixed to the first part (1) via said cylindrical part (3), 
whereby the cylindrical part (3) and the corresponding 

tubular part (8) have radially projecting, axially disposed, mutually interleaved 
projections (5, 9), characterized in that said projections 

of one of said cylindrical and tubular parts (3, 8) comprise cutting profiles (5), 
which comprise several circumferential sharp blades located 

at certain distances from each other and provided with sharp outer edges 
which cut into the projections (9) of the other of said cylindrical and tubular parts (3, 8) 

as the cylindrical part (3) tends to rotate with the screw 
(11) on the cylindrical part's (3) axial movement 

caused by the screw (11). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cutting profiles (5) are formed at the periphery of the 

cylindrical part (3). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
cutting profiles (5) are formed at the inner surface of the 

tubular part (8). 
Device according to any previous claim, characterized in 
that the profiles (5) are closed at one edge by an axial 

partition wall (6) of the part (3, 8). 
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that the
