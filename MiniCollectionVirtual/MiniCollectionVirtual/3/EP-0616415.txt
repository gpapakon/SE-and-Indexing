<ABSTRACT>
Quasi-resonant voltage invertor with pulse-width modulation, including a bridge (2) and an oscillating circuit consisting of an inductor (5) in series with the voltage source (1) and of a capacitor (6) in parallel with the bridge (2), the sampling period being very much longer than the resonance period, characterised in that it includes a driven component operating in off/saturated mode (7) in parallel with the capacitor (6) and a voltage sensor (8) in parallel with the capacitor (6), the component (7) being driven by the sensor (8) so as to short-circuit the capacitor (6) when the voltage at the terminals of the latter is zero and to enable transitions of the signal for control of the pulse-width modulation regulation.
