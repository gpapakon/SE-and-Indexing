<DESCRIPTION>
 ELECT OLYÎ C DOUBLE LAYER CAPACITORThis application is a Continuation-in-Part appUcation of copending U.S.S.N. 07/960,251 filed October 13,1 992, which is a Continuation of application U.S.S.N. 07/783,850, filed October 29, 1991, now abandoned. Background of the InventionThis invention relates to double layer capacitors, and more particularly relates to high-energy, high-power electrolytic capacitors.Conventional electrolytic capacitors store energy by accommodating a so-called double layer of charge at the interface of each capacitor electrode surface and the electrolytic solution between the electrodes. The electrode surface area thus limits the energy storage capacity of such capacitors; the larger the electrode surface area, the larger the double layer of charge which may be generated, and hence the greater the energy storage of the capacitor. Typical applications restrict the practical limit of a capacitor's physical size, however, and thereby limit the achievable energy storage capacity provided by the macroscopic surfaces of the capacitor.One double layer capacitor design which overcomes the macroscopic capacitor surface area limitation employs powdered electrode materials, e.g., high-area, activated carbon particles, to microscopically increase the surface area of the capacitor electrodes. In such a capacitor, the carbon particles are bound together to form a porous electrode structure in which the exposed surfaces of the particles contribute to the overall electrode surface area. The internal resistance and capacitance of the porous electrode structure is a complicated function of the carbon particles' structure and configuration.Summary of the InventionIn general, in one aspect, the invention provides a double layer electrolytic capacitor of two electrodes each in contact with a common liquid electrolyte. At least one of the electrodes comprises a crystalline material characterized by the presence of van der Waals channels in the material. These van der Waals channels are adapted to accommodate the 

 electrolyte within the channels, such that a double layer of charge is formed at interfaces of the van der Waals channels and the electrolyte when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. This ability to utilize the van der Waals channels as extensions of the electrode's macroscopic surface provides a dramatic increase in capacitance over conventional double layer capacitors. Further detailed descriptions of compounds having van der Waals channels and devices which utilize these compounds
