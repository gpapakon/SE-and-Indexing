<ABSTRACT>
A crossbar (4) for roof loads on a motor vehicle provided with roof rails is described which extends from one tubular rail (3) to the other in each case equipped with a releasable clamping device at each end for fastening to the tubular rails (3) which in each case has a supporting jaw (9) and a clamping jaw (12) which can be moved relative to the supporting jaw and has a jaw part which takes the form of a bow part (20) and partially encloses the assigned tubular rail (3) for fixing the crossbar (4) when the clamping device is being fastened. Provision is made for the clamping jaw (12) to be pivotally mounted and to be pivotal and lockable by means of manual pivoting of a pivoted lever (11) against the associated tubular rail (3).

<CLAIMS>
Cross-member (4) for roof loads on a motor 
vehicle equipped with roof rails, the cross-member 

extending from one rail tube (3) to the other and being 
equipped with a respective releasable clamping device at 

each end region for the fastening on the rail tubes (3), 
the clamping device in each case having a supporting jaw 

(9) and a clamping jaw (12) which is movable relative to 
the latter and has a jaw part which is designed as a 

curved part (20) and partially surrounds the relevant 
rail tube (3) so as to hold the cross-member (4) when the 

clamping device is being fastened, the clamping jaw (12) 
being mounted pivotably and by manual pivoting of a 

pivoted lever (11), pivotable around a horizontally 
directed pivot pin (14), can be pivoted against the 

relevant rail tube (3) and locked, and the clamping jaw 
(12) being designed in the manner of a two-armed lever, 

pivotable around a horizontally directed pivot pin (15), 
with a lower lever arm as curved part (20), characterized 

in that by pressing down the pivoted lever (11) a clamping 

cam (22) connected thereto in a rotationally fixed 
manner is pivoted against the upper lever arm of the 

clamping jaw (12), which upper lever arm is designed with 
an engagement surface (21) for the clamping cam (22), and 

is moved along this engagement surface in order thereby 
to pivot the clamping jaw (12) around the pivot pin (15) 

and the lower lever arm with its curved part (20) against 
the rail tube (3) and to clamp the rail tube (3) between 

the supporting jaw (9) and the curved part (20) of the 
clamping jaw (12), the supporting jaw (9) having bearing 

surfaces (17, 18, 19) for the rail tube (3), two bearing  
 

surfaces (17, 19) of which run approximately perpendicularly 
with respect to one another, whereas a third 

bearing surface (18) connects the first two bearing 
surfaces (17, 19) obliquely to one another. 
Cross-member according to Claim 1, characterized 
in that the engagement surface (21) of the upper lever 

arm of the clamping jaw (12) runs in an arcuate manner, 
approximately corresponding to the pivot radius of the 

clamping cam (22), but with a spiral-like gradient. 
Cross-member according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized 
in that a transfer link (13) is provided which is 

arranged movably on the pivot pin (14) of the pivoted 
lever (11) and bears the clamping jaw (12), the pivot 

position of the transfer link (13) being able to be 
determined and locked by an adjusting member. 
Cross-member according to at least one of Claims 
1 to 3, characterized in that the adjusting member 

comprises a threaded nut (23), which is fastened on the 
transfer link (13), and a cheese-head screw (25) which is 

guided displaceably within said nut and is supported on 
the main body (5). 
Cross-member according to at least one of Claims 
1 to 4, characterized in that an adjusting knob (25), 

which is arranged on the cross-member (4) in a manner 
which is favourable with gripping, is coupled to the 

cheese-head screw (24) in order to drive it along. 
Cross-member according to at least one of Claims 
1 to 5, characterized in that the pivoted lever (11) is 

equipped with a cylinder lock (28) having a locking bolt 
(27).
