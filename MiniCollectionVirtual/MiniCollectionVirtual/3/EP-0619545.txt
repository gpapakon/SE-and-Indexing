<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates generally to repair of memory
by redundancy. The invention relates more specifically
to a method of reducing power consumption in a memory
having a redundancy-based repair system.High density memory devices typically include a
redundancy-based repair system for substituting
redundant rows or columns of memory cells for use in
place of non-operational or defective primary rows or
columns.When a defective primary row or column (hereafter,
primary memory block) is detected within a memory
device, the row or column addressing mechanism of the
device is reprogrammed to select an operative redundant
memory block in place of the defective primary block.This reprogramming or "select-substituting" step
works by disabling all requested couplings of the local
data read and/or data write lines of the defective
memory block to the global read and/or write lines of
the memory device. The select-substituting step also 
enables a substitute coupling of the local data read and/or write lines of the
redundant memory block to the global read and/or write lines of the memory
device in response to access requests directed at the defective memory block.
Data which would have been stored in or read from the defective primary
block is instead written to or fetched from the redundant memory block.The above procedure overlooks the possibility that a defective memory
block might continue to draw power through its bit line load paths even
though its read and/or write lines have been decoupled from the global read
and/or write lines. This can be troublesome, particularly when the defective
memory block has a defect which draws excessive current even after the read
and/or write lines of the defective block have been decoupled from the global
read and/or write lines. In other words, repair of a storage-function defect
does not necessarily correct a concomitant leakage current problem unless
additional steps are taken to shut off such leakage when the storage-function
repair is made.This general problem is addressed in prior art proposals disclosed in
JP-A-04181589 and JP-A-04271099. Each of these documents discloses one
or more arrangements for interrupting the voltage supply to the bitlines of a
defective memory block.The present invention provides practical arrangements for overcoming
the above-mentioned problems by decoupling a defective or otherwise non-operational
memory block from the power lines of a memory device. Such
decoupling is preferably carried out when the non-operational defective
memory block
