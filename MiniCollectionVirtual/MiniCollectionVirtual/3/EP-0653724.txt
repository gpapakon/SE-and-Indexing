<ABSTRACT>
A fingerprint image cutout processing device for 
a tenprint card (70) includes a tenprint card image input 

unit (10) for inputting, on a card basis, image data of a 
tenprint card in which rolled fingerprints and plain 

fingerprints of ten fingers of each hand are printed, an 
image storage unit (30) for storing image data of the 

tenprint card input by said tenprint card image input 
unit (10), cutout information input portion (21) for 

displaying the tenprint card images and ten cutout frames 
for specifying a cutout range of a fingerprint image of 

each finger to be superposed with each other and 
receiving input of fingerprint cutout information of each 

finger, and a cutout and edit portion (22) for cutting 
and editing fingerprint image data of each finger out of 

the image data of the tenprint card stored in the image 
storage unit (30) and displaying the edited data based on 

the input cutout information.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a tenprint card
reader for use in inputting fingerprint images printed on
a tenprint card to a computerized fingerprint collation
system.In general, collation of fingerprint images by a
computerized fingerprint collation system is carried out
by inputting and processing each individual fingerprint
images printed on a tenprint card on a finger basis.A common tenprint card, on which fingerprints are
printed, is approximately 20 centimeters square in area.
The tenprint card is typically composed of a rolled
fingerprint section on which a rolled fingerprint of each
finger is to be printed and a plain fingerprint section
on which a plain fingerprint of each finger is to be
printed. Herein, the rolled fingerprint represents a
print taken of a rolling finger and the plain fingerprint
represent a print of a finger taken without rolling.The rolled fingerprint section is made up of ten
regions for ten fingers, each having an area of some 4
centimeters square. The plain fingerprint section is 
made up of a thumb region on which a plain fingerprint of
the thumb is to be printed, and a four-finger region on
which plain fingerprints of four fingers, the forefinger,
the middle finger, the ring finger and the little finger,
are printed all together. The tenprint card is capable
of containing fingerprints of a total of 20 fingers in
the above-described respective regions. The size and the
position of the respective regions of the rolled
fingerprint section and the plain fingerprint section may
slightly vary with a kind of tenprint card.In fingerprint image collation by a fingerprint
collation system, out of a fingerprint image of each
finger printed on the above-described tenprint card, an
image within a range of some 2.6 centimeters square is
first cut to include a core of its fingerprint and the
following collation processing is economically carried
out with respect to the fingerprint image data within
this cutout range.A fingerprint image cutout processing device is
for cutting and sequentially inputting fingerprint images
of ten fingers to be collated out of the tenprint card.A conventional fingerprint image cutout
processing device for a tenprint card cuts out rolled
fingerprints of the tenprint card within the
above-described cutout range and inputs the cut-out
fingerprint images to a fingerprint collation system on a 
finger basis. The fingerprint image cutout range of each
finger is determined by numerically inputting location
data of each rolled fingerprint section of a
