<DESCRIPTION>
The use of fabric filters has grown significantly as 
environmental standards for particulate emissions have 
become more stringent. Fabric filters are used because they 
are highly efficient, easily operated and in many cases the 
least expensive method of control. Selection of the type of 
fabric filter equipment is usually governed by the nature of 
the particulate to be collected, i.e., reverse air or shaker 
units for fumes and submicron particles and jet pulse units 
for coarse, non-tacky dusts. Several factors should be considered when deciding upon 
the type baghouse fabric to be used. Included are: (1) 
operating temperature (2) abrasion resistance (3) filtering 
performance and (4) chemical resistance. Filtering 
performance is determined by the complex interaction of 
fibre and fabric structure with the dust to be collected. It is apparent that the selection of filter bag fabric 
is of extreme importance since one fabric may last much 
longer than other fabrics in the same environment. US-A-4536439 discloses filter bags for filtering hot gases consisting 
of a mono-layered felt fabric of entangled staple fibres of 
poly(m-phenylene 
isophthalamide). These fibres have a defined length, 
crystallinity index, basis weight, air permeability, cross-machine-direction 
modulus and abrasion resistance. US 4750443 discloses as a fire-blocking sheet a textile 
fabric consisting of 3 to 7 fastened-together non-woven 
fabric layers. Each layer is non-apertured and consists of 
25 to 100 weight % of poly(p-phenylene terephthalamide) 
staple fibres and 0 to 75 weight % of poly(m-phenylene 
isophthalamide) staple fibres. 
Laminates comprising an outer layer of PPD-T needled to a MPD-I 
layer are not disclosed. JP-A-57018239 discloses heat-resistant sheets comprising a laminate 
of a non-woven sheet of long fibres of certain polyamides, e.g. poly-p-phenylene 
terephthalic acid amide, laminated to a non-woven sheet of 
short fibres of a heat-resistant resin, e.g. poly-ε-caprolactam 
or aromatic polyamide. The specific combinations of layers according 
to claim 1 are not disclosed in the CA and Derwent abstracts. The figure shows a schematic of a typical bag filter chamber.  
 The present invention provides a cloth suitable for use 
in filter bags for filtering exhaust gases containing 
entrained hot particles, said cloth 
comprising a laminate of a felt of poly(m-phenylene 
isophthalamide), polyester fibers or polyphenylenesulfide 
fibres having a thin nonwoven fabric of poly(p-phenylene 
terephthalamide)

<CLAIMS>
A cloth suitable for use in filter bags for filtering exhaust 
gases containing entrained hot particles, said cloth 

comprising a laminate of a felt of poly(m-phenylene 
isophthalamide), polyester fibers or polyphenylenesulfide fibers 

having a thin nonwoven fabric of poly(p-phenylene 
terephthalamide) fibers needled thereto, the poly(p-phenylene 

terephthalamide) fabric forming an exterior layer of the cloth.  
 
A cloth according to claim 1 wherein the 
poly(phenylene terephthalamide) fabric has a basis weight of 

from 1 to 2 oz/yd² (33.9 to 67.8 g/m²). 
A bag filter that is highly resistant to hot 
particles entrained in exhaust gaseous streams, comprising a 

bag retainer clothed in a filter bag, the cloth of said 
filter bag being the one according to claim 1 or 2, 

the poly(p-phenylene 
terephthalamide) fabric being positioned at the 

exterior surface of the filter bag first exposed to the hot 
particle laden gas stream.
