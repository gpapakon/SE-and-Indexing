<ABSTRACT>
In an antenna duplexer, one antenna is used by 
switching transmission signals and reception signal having 

different frequencies. The antenna duplexer comprises a 
high-frequency switching circuit and a band-pass filter. The 

high-frequency switching circuit supplies the transmission 
signals from a transmission part to the antenna. The band-pass 

filter outputs the reception signals outputted from the antenna 
to the predetermined receiving circuit. In the band-pass 

filter, the frequency characteristic is selected and set to 
impress the frequency of the transmission signals, and 

simultaneously the reflected wave generated at the input end so 
that impedance increases at the frequency band of the 

transmission signals.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to an antenna duplexer and
a transmitting/receiving apparatus using the antenna duplexer,
and more particularly, relates to an antenna duplexer and a
transmitting/receiving apparatus having an antenna which is
alternately used with a transmission signal and a reception
signal frequencies of which are different each other.Heretofore, in a time division multiplexed radio
communication system, such as a digital car telephone,
transmission and reception frequencies are set to be different
each other, and an antenna is alternately used for transmission
and reception by means of an antenna.For a car telephone, the available space for an
antenna is limited and a terminal unit must be downsized
in view of the convenience of users. Therefore, it
is difficult to use an exclusive antenna 
for transmission and reception respectively. Thus, one
antenna is shared for transmission and reception in the
car telephone.The antenna duplexer is composed of a duplexer
circuit or a switching circuit having diodes and
transistors.As shown in Fig. 1, an antenna duplexer 1 sends a
transmission signal STX outputted from a transmitting
circuit through a band-pass filter (BPF) 2 to a phase
shifting circuit 3 an output of which is connected to
an antenna 4.The antenna 4 is further connected to a phase
shifting circuit 5 of the receiving side an output
signal of which is delivered to a receiving circuit
through a band-pass filter 6.As shown in Fig. 2, each of the band-pass filters
2 and 6 is composed of a filter with a steep out-of-band
damping characteristic in which the frequency
bands fT and fR of a transmission signal STX and a
reception signal SRX are respectively selected as a
pass band so that the reception signal SRX and the
transmission signal STX are adequately suppressed.The antenna duplexer 1 selectively transmits the
transmission signal STX output from the transmitting 
circuit to the antenna 4 and also selectively receives
the reception signal SRX picked up by the antenna 4 to
the recieving circuit.The phase shifting circuits 3 and 5 are respectively
selected do as to have a predetermined phase
characteristic in order to realise matching with the
antenna 4.On the contrary, as shown in Fig.3, some cases can
be considered, in which a switching circuit is composed
of diodes to thereby share one antenna 4 for transmission
and reception.GB-A-1 149 093 discloses a transmit-receive switch
upon which the preamble of claim 1 is based.US 4 723 305 discloses a portable telephone having a
notch antenna. Band
