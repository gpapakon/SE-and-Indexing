<ABSTRACT>
Ceramic and polymer based compositions which 
direct the controlled sustained release of TGF-β to 

bone tissue and improved surgical implant devices 
incorporating such compositions are described. The 

compositions and improved surgical implant devices of 
the invention induce and/or enhance the process of 

osteogenesis in animal bone tissue thereby resulting 
in the formation of new mature bone, and are useful 

for repairing orthopaedic and periodontal bone tissue 
defects. Several particular embodiments are described 

by way of examples which illustrate the methods of 
manufacturing the compositions and improved surgical 

implants, the TGF-β release kinetic properties of the 
compositions, and the efficacy of the compositions and 

improved surgical implant devices in animal models. 
In one such particular embodiment, a critical defect 

introduced into a rat skull is repaired using a 
ceramic-based TGF-β delivery composition.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is directed to 
compositions which provide controlled release of 
biologically active transforming growth factor-beta 
(TGF-β) to bony tissue, thereby inducing osteogenic 
activity and coordinating the accelerated formation of 
new bone. The compositions of the invention may be 
used alone or may be incorporated into orthopedic 
implant devices and used to accelerate the formation 
of new bone in various medical and dental 
applications. Bone has a remarkable capacity for 
regenerative growth; however, there are many clinical 
indications in which the bony repair process is 
impaired. These include situations in which there is 
too much bone loss for the bone to regenerate, such as 
skeletal deformations caused by trauma, malformation, 
cancer, or reconstructive cosmetic surgeries. There 
is a critical need for the development of implant and 
drug delivery technology for use in numerous clinical 
situations to augment or promote bone healing. The use of autologous cartilage and bone, 
presently the materials of choice for skeletal 
augmentation and reconstruction, have several 
drawbacks including donor site morbidity, limited 
quantities of grafting material, and unpredictable 
implant resorption. As a result, a variety of 
different materials have been studied that may 
function as artificial implants for bone repair, 
including ceramics, composites, bone derivatives and  
 
natural and synthetic polymers (Damien et al., 1991, 
J. Appl. Biomat., 2:187-208). An ideal implant or graft material must 
possess certain basic properties, including 
biocompatibility, sterilizability, osteoinductive 
activity (i.e., stimulation of phenotypic conversion 
of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts, with bone 
formation) and osteoconductive activity (i.e., acting 
as a trellis for new bone formation). Porosity and 
pore density of the implant material play an important 
role in its osteoconductive properties. Implant 
materials should also degrade in concert with new bone 
growth without interfering with the formation of new 
bone. The implant should not induce adverse local 
tissue reaction, be immunogenic, or systemically 
toxic. Many of the materials presently under 
investigation only partially satisfy these 
requirements. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and poly(lactic-coglycolic 
acid) (PLPG) polymers have been used 
experimentally for osseous repair. Both polymers are 
biocompatible and biodegradable and have demonstrated 
a capacity to induce bony wound healing in some 
instances (Hollinger,
