<ABSTRACT>
Multilayer plastic sheets comprising a core layer and at least one outer layer containing 1 to 15 wt. % UV absorbers are produced by coextrusion of branched Si-free polycarbonates of 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxy)-propane, the branched polycarbonate having a weight average molecular weight of 27,000 to 29,500.

<CLAIMS>
Process for the production of multi-layer plastics
sheets by coextrusion of branched, Si-free

polycarbonates prepared from 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane
consisting of a core layer and at least

one outer layer having a content of 1 wt.% to 15 wt.%
of UV absorbers, characterised in that the branched

polycarbonate has an 
M
w
 of 27000 to 29500 and that
coextrusion is performed continuously for a period of

at least 5 hours.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the polycarbonate has an 
M
w
 of 28000 to 29000.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
coextrusion is performed continuously for a period of

at least 8 hours.
Process according to claim 1, characterised in that
the UV absorbers used are those of the formula (I) or

(II)
