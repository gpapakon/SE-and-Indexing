<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to polymer blends, and more 
particularly it relates to blends of polyethylene 
copolymers. In another aspect this invention relates 
to transdermal drug delivery devices and to backings 
for use in such devices. This invention also relates 
to extruded films. In another aspect this invention 
relates to packages. Polymer films are used in many applications, 
including as components of packaging materials. It is 
desirable to optimize certain properties of the 
packaging material, including oxygen permeability, 
moisture vapor transmission rate, heat-sealability, 
resistance to oily substances, and handling 
characteristics to suit the particular article to be 
packaged and the conditions of storage. From EP-A- 317 916, for example, a blend of LLDPE and VLDPE is known. Polymer films have also been used as backings for 
transdermal drug delivery devices. Transdermal drug 
delivery is an increasingly important method of drug 
administration. Transdermal drug delivery devices 
typically involve a carrier (such as a liquid, gel, or 
solid matrix, or a pressure sensitive adhesive) into 
which the drug to be delivered is incorporated. The 
drug-containing carrier is then placed on the skin and 
the drug, along with any adjuvants and excipients, is 
delivered to the skin. Typically the portions of the carrier that are not 
in contact with the skin are covered by a backing. The 
backing serves to protect the carrier (and the 
components contained in the carrier, including the 
drug) from the environment and prevents loss of the 
ingredients of the drug delivery device to the  
 
environment. Because hydration of the stratum corneum 
is known to enhance transport of certain drugs across 
the skin, it is sometimes desirable that the backing 
have a relatively low moisture vapor transmission rate 
in order to retain moisture at the site covered by the 
drug delivery device. In order to maintain the health 
of the covered skin during long term wear (e.g., for 
periods in excess of a day) by allowing the skin to 
breath, it is also desirable that the backing have 
relatively high permeability to oxygen. Further, as 
the backing is in contact with the components of the 
carrier, including the drug and any adjuvants and 
excipients, it is important that the backing be stable 
to such components in order that the backing retain 
structural integrity, tensile strength, and 
conformability to the skin. It is also important that 
the backing not absorb drug or other excipients from 
the carrier. In
