<ABSTRACT>
In a data collection method of MR angiography of the 
invention where scan in warp values of m in number is carried out 

in times of the adding average number a per each warp value 
thereby data of m x a sets are collected, when integer being the 

closest to the value of 
{the period T of heartbeat / (the scan 
repeat time TR x the adding average number a)}
 is made n, the 
warp values are varied in sequence and continuous scan of n times 

is carried out, and such scan is repeated by times of the adding 
average number a and data of n x a sets are collected and this is 

repeated regarding all warp values thereby data of m x a sets are 
collected.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a data collection method 
for MR angiography, and more specifically to a data collection 
method for MR angiography where even if the adding average number 
of measured data is selected arbitrarily a good angiography image 
without motion arch fact can be obtained. An example of a data collection method for MR angiography in 
the prior art is shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 is an explanation 
diagram regarding a data collection method of MR angiography 
proposed by C. Dumoulin et al. in "Rapid Scan Magnetic Resonance 
Angiography (Mag. Reson. Med. 1987;5:238-45)". In the data collection method of MR angiography, integer a 
being the closest to the value of {period T of heartbeat / (scan 
repeat time TR)} is made the adding average number and scan of 
the same warp value is repeated by times of the adding average 
number a and data of the a sets in the same warp value are 
collected and such scan is repeated regarding the warp value of m 
steps, thereby data of m x a sets are collected. In Fig. 4, 
period of updating the warp value is 
t = TR x a  
 and is nearly 
equal to the period T of heartbeat. According to this, since any bloodstream rate in each step 
of the warp value becomes the average bloodstream rate of one  
 
heartbeat and no difference exists between steps, a good 
angiography image without motion arch fact can be obtained. In the above-mentioned data collection method of MR 
angiography in the prior art, the time of t x m is required to 
collect data of m x a sets. t is nearly equal to the period T of 
the heartbeat and is about one second. Also the step number is 
256 for example. Consequently, in this case, the data collection 
time becomes about 256 seconds. If the adding average number a is decreased to 2 of minimum, 
as shown in Fig. 5, since t becomes t = 2TR, the whole data 
collection time can be reduced even when the warp step number m 
is the same. However, since the bloodstream rate in each step of 
the warp value does not always become the average bloodstream 
rate of one heartbeat and difference between steps increases, the 
motion arch fact becomes noticeable. That is, in the data collection method of MR angiography in 
the prior art, since the adding average number a must be selected 
to a value so that product with TR is approximately coincident 
with one period of the heartbeat, a problem exists in that the 
adding average number a cannot be selected arbitrarily. Another 
problem exists in that since the adding average number a becomes 
a
