<ABSTRACT>
Method for calculating the mass of air inlet into (admitted to) a cylinder (12) of an internal combustion engine (1) of the type including a control system (7) governing the injection of fuel (2) on the basis of signals transmitted by a crankshaft sensor (8) and by a pressure sensor (9) which is located in the inlet manifold (3), the mass of air inlet being deduced from the manifold pressure EPcoll at the moment of closure of the inlet valve (11), characterised in that the value of the pressure EPcoll is calculated for each top dead centre position of index i as the sum of the pressure pcoll(i) produced by the pressure sensor and an increment DPcoll(i), the increment DPcoll(i) being calculated as the product of the derivative dPcoll(i) with respect to time of the manifold pressure between two top dead centre positions and the time lapse between the moment at which Pcoll(i) is measured and the moment at which the valve (11) closes.

Method of calculation of the mass of air admitted into a cylinder (12) of 
an internal combustion engine (1) in order to determine the quantity of 

fuel which has to be injected into said cylinder (12), said engine (1) 
being of the type comprising an electronic control system (7) regulating 

the operation of the fuel injectors (2) by means of values provided by a 
crankshaft sensor (8) and by a pressure sensor (9) arranged in the inlet 

manifold (3) supplying the air to the different cylinders, the mass of air 
admitted being calculated from the inlet pressure EPcoll at the time of 

closure of the inlet valve (11) of the cylinder (12), characterised in that 
the value of the manifold pressure EPcoll is calculated at each top dead 

centre indexed i of said cylinder, as being the sum of the pressure 
Pcoll(i) produced by said pressure sensor (9) and an increment DPcoll(i), 

said increment DPcoll(i) being calculated as being the product of the 
differential dPcoll(i) with respect to time of the manifold pressure 

between two top dead centres and a period Dell(i) expressed as a top 
dead centre corresponding to the length of time separating the time of the 

measurement Pcoll(i) and the time of closure of the inlet valve (11). 
Method of calculation of the mass of air according to claim 1, 
characterised in that said period Dell(i) is obtained in the form of a predetermined 

function of the speed N(i) of the engine. 
Method of calculation of the mass of air according to any one of claims 
1 to 2, characterised in that on the one hand, said differential dPcoll(i) 

with respect to time of the manifold pressure between two top dead 
centres is calculated as being the product of a factor K(i) and the 

differential dMcoll(i) with respect to time of the mass of air contained in 
the manifold (3) between two top dead centres.  

 
Method of calculation of the mass of air according to claim 3, 
characterised in that said differential dMcoll(i) with respect to time of the 

mass of air contained in the manifold (3) between two top dead centres 
is obtained in the form of a difference between the mass of air Mpap(i) 

entering the inlet manifold between two top dead centres and the filtered 
value FMpap(i) of said mass of air Mpap(i). 
Method of calculation of the mass of air according to claim 4, 
characterised in that said filtered value FMpap(i) of said mass of air 

Mpap(i) is obtained by first order low pass filtering. 
Method of calculation of the mass of air according to claim 5, 
characterised in that said value of said mass of air Mpap(i) is obtained 

as the product of a period Del2(i) corresponding to the length of time 
separating two top dead centres, the through section S(i) of said manifold 

(3) and of a function F' of said filtered value FMpap(i-1) calculated at 
the preceding top dead centre.
