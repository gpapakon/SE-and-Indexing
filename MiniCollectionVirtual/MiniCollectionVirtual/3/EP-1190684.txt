<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an artificial insemination device for the insemination of bovines and
other animals comprising three hollow and essentially cylindrical tubular elements, each element is

provided with an open proximal and a open distal end, said three elements being:

an outer protective sheath,
 
an inner sheath and a semen tube, and
a semen tube,

whereby the diameter of said elements is such that the inner sheath is axial movably in the outer
protective sheath and the semen tube is axial movably in the inner sheath, whereby the length of

the outer sheath is less than the length of the inner sheath.
The invention further relates to an outer sheath, an inner sheath and a semen tube for use
in an Al device and to a method for the insemination of bovines and other animals, comprising the

steps of inserting through the cervix and into the uterine horn, a closed tubular element to a point
near the major curve of the horn, opening said tubular element by protrusion of an inner tubular

element and provide manual guidance to it into the curve of the horn and positioning the distal end
of the inner tubular element near the ovary, and further providing semen nearby the ovary through

an internal semen channel.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for the artificial insemination of bovines and
other animals.Worldwide, artificial insemination (Al) has penetrated about 80% of the dairy industry but only about
5% of the beef producing industry. One reason is the need for skilled personnel, veterinarians and
technicians, trained to grasp the cervix via the rectum and to guide the Al pipette into or through the
cervix.In the traditional Al, the inseminator must insert the insemination tube into the cervix by developing
the tactile skill to work through the wall of the large intestine while pushing the tube forward through
the vagina with the other hand. The cervix is more than 10 cm long (10,16 - 15,24 cm in beef cattle)
and often has several bends (e.g. "s" or "v" shape in some Brahman cattle), and has several very
tight sphincters through which the Al tube must be guided. Hence there is the ever present danger
of perforating the wall of the cervix or the uterus with the inseminating tube, causing injury to the
animal. Because of these difficulties, it is often impossible to advance the inseminating tube very far
into the cervix, with a corresponding lower insemination efficiency and conception success rate.Several artificial insemination devices are known, for example as disclosed in US 6,071,231 and
US 4,493,700.An overview article on Al is found in Acta Vet. Scand. 1998, 39, 149-163 "Deep Uterine
Insemination of Cattle: A fruitful Way Forward with Smaller Numbers of Spermatozoa" by Hunter
and Greve. As in the present invention the importance of the site of fertilization and of spermatozoa
deposition, i.e. near the utero-tubal junction is explained.While these devices and methods have been a great advancement in artificial insemination,
reducing time, expenses and effort, and increasing effectiveness, there are still a number of
problems. The major disadvantage of the deposition of the semen at the posterior end of the uterus is the
great loss (about 60%) of the inseminated semen. Only about 40% of the insemination remains in
the female genital tract and only 0.1% of this reaches the place of fertilization in the oviduct.One problem is that these devices do not deliver the optimum quantity and concentration of semen
that will maximize the probability of conception since there is no way to assure that all of the semen
is transferred from its storage straw into the uterus of the animal without any losses.Another problem is that these devices do not simplify the deliverance of the optimum total
