<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a system and method of
achieving both convective and diffusive transport of
plasma across a membrane accompanied by the selective
removal of plasma components using sorbents, immobilized
enzymes or antibodies followed by reinfusion of the
purified plasma to a patient in an extracorporeal blood
circulation system without using any plasma pump or
transmembrane pressure controls.Conventional therapeutic processes for the
purification of blood extracorporeally include
hemodialysis, ultrafiltration, plasmapheresis,
hemoperfusion, plasma perfusion and combinations of
these, i.e. hemofiltration, plasma exchange,
hemodiafiltration and hemodialysis with sorbent
regeneration of dialysate. Except for hemoperfusion,
where blood is perfused through a column of selective
sorbents directly (excepting those sorbents which are
encapsulated by a membrane), all of the processes
include a semipermeable membrane as an interface between
the blood phase and the purification medium.An electrolyte solution (dialysate solution) serves
as the purification medium in hemodialysis.
Ultrafiltration and plasmapheresis techniques do not
utilize a purification medium. Rather, purification is
done by removing a portion of fluid components from the 
blood plasma by filtration using transmembrane pressure
difference as the driving force. Hemodialysis,
ultrafiltration and plasmapheresis do not selectively
remove specified components. Instead all components
below the pore size of the membrane filter are removed
by them. Hemodialysis and ultrafiltration use small pore
size membranes which are below the size of plasma
proteins (i.e. albumin has a mole weight of about 60,000
Daltons). On the other hand, plasmapheresis uses
membranes with pore sizes greater than the size of
plasma proteins so that large plasma components such as
autoantibodies, immune complexes and viruses can be
removed from the blood plasma. A distinct disadvantage
in this process is that useful plasma components, such
as certain proteins, enzymes and hormones, are also
removed and lost.In hemoperfusion and plasma perfusion techniques,
selectivity is achieved by using selective sorbents for
the binding of components to be removed from the blood.
In plasma perfusion, plasma must first be separated from
the blood by pumping blood through a membrane plasma
filter or, in the alternative, a centrifuge is used to
separate plasma from the blood. The plasma obtained as
the filtrate or by decanting from the packed cells, is
then pumped through a column of
