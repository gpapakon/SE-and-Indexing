<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to imidazopyridino-, pyrazolopyridino-,
pyrazolapyrrolidino- and pyrozoloazepino-substituted oximes, useful for the treatment of
atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia.Atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States
and Western European countries. Hypercholesterolemia, especially increased levels of
low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, has been shown to be related to an increased
risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) (Lowering blood cholesterol to prevent heart
disease: NIH consensus development conference statement. (1985) Arteriosclerosis 5:
404-412). In the United States alone, hypercholesterolemia contributes to 1.5 million
myocardial infarctions per year and up to 0.5 million people die as a direct result of
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Lipid Research Clinics Program. The Lipid
Research Clinics primary prevention trial results: the relationship of reduction in
incidence of coronary heart disease to cholesterol lowering. (1984) JAMA 251: 365-374).
It is estimated that as many as 40 million people in the United States between the
ages of 40 to 70 years have high cholesterol levels and are candidates for lipid-lowering
therapy. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), sponsored by the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, is a major national effort to educate
physicians and the public about the risks associated with high blood cholesterol levels.
In addition, the NCEP has suggested guidelines to identify and treat patients with high
serum cholesterol (Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel
on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults. (1988)
Arch. Intern. Med. 148: 36-69).There is substantial evidence that lowering total and LDL cholesterol reduce the
risk of CHD. Of particular interest are the outcomes of several angiographic trials of
decreased total and LDL cholesterol (Blankenhorn, D.H., Nessim, S.A., Johnson. R.L. et
al. (1987) Beneficial effects of combined colestipol-niacin therapy on coronary 
atherosclerosis and coronary venous bypass grafts. JAMA 257: 3233-3240. Brensike,
