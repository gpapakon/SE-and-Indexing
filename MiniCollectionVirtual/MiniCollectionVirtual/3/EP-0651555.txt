<ABSTRACT>
A process is described for digitising the relevant portion of a 
colour image by a system with reduced memory capacity. The colour 

image is scanned twice. The image signals (30) are sub-sampled (I) 
the first time and spatially reduced (II) the second time to the 

relevant image portion. The spatial data (35,36) for the relevant 
image portion are determined on an interactive work station (34), on 

which the sampled image signals (33) are displayed. Initial sampling 
and resampling by the scanner take place with the same spatial 

resolution. By carrying out the sub-sampling and the spatial 
reduction during scanning, an important saving of memory is 

realised. Owing to the fact that the colour image is digitised in 
one single step, register faults are avoided.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process and a device for
spatially selectively digitising optical colour images on a
transparent or opaque carrier by means of a system with restricted
memory capacity and signal-transmission rate for use in electronic
document scanners, pre-press systems or copying systems.A digitiser is known to convert an optical image into electric
signals giving each individually an indication of the optical
density of a very limited portion (pixel) of the image. On colour
images different spectral densities are distinguished that are
defining the colour components in which the colour image is being
analyzed. The operational characteristics of the digitiser will
depend among others on the spatial resolution and the density
resolution. The spatial resolution can be characterised by the
linear dimensions of a pixel or the number of pixels per running
unit length measured on the original, e.g. pixels per mm or dots per
inch (dpi). The density resolution provides an indication of the
number of tone values the full range covered by the minimum and
maximum densities of each colour component is digitised into. The
expression "resolution" used herein below refers to the spatial
resolution only.A number of digitisers have a variable resolution as a result of
the use of optical, mechanical or electronic means, whereas on other
devices the resolution is fixed, which considerably simplifies their
construction thereby reducing their cost.The relevant image portion on a colour original is often
provided on a restricted area of the image carrier. Alternatively,
the image carrier as such may be significantly smaller than the
surface area that can be sampled or read in by the digitiser. In
many cases it may not only be necessary to delete margins on the
original but also to read in or copy but well specified areas of a
document or manuscript. In such cases it may not be advisable to
read in the entire original. Therefore, several processes and
devices have been proposed for efficiently selecting the image
portion before any further image processing steps. A first system consists of a lining-up table with an illuminated
top and a digitising pad to which the user fixes the original for
determining the spatial data of the delineation lines of the image-cropping
of the area comprising the relevant image portion. On this
lining-up table the size and the position of the original to be
scanned are specified and in some cases even an angle of rotation if
a rotation of the image portion through a given

A process for digitising a relevant image portion of a colour
image comprising the following steps :


generating a first set of image signals (30) by an initial
sampling of said colour image ;
reducing (I) the number of image signals contained in said
first set ;
displaying the reduced image signals (33) on an interactive
work station (34);
acquiring spatial data (35,36) determining said relevant
image portion on said interactive work station ;
generating a second set of image signals (30) by resampling
said colour image or portion of said colour image

comprising said relevant image portion; and
restricting (II) the number of image signals contained in
said second set by restricting the image signals mainly to

the image signals specified by the spatial data (35',36');

resampling are performed at the same spatial resolution.
