<ABSTRACT>
A vectorial assembly method for first and second 
stage assemblies (5, 3) of radial tires, whereby a first 

stage assembly (5), mounted on a rotary inner support 
(52) so as to rotate about its axis, and a second stage 

assembly (3), housed inside a toroidal body (7) mounted 
for rotation, about a horizontal axis (8), on a 

supporting saddle (31) adjustable about a vertical axis 
(21), are rotated for determining their respective 

unbalance vectors, and are assembled, the first (5) 
inside the second (3), in relative angular positions 

such as to minimize the unbalance vector of the 
assembled tire.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method for
assembling first and second stage assemblies of road
vehicle tires.In particular, the present invention relates to a
method for assembling first and second stage assemblies
of road vehicle tires, comprising phases consisting in
placing the first stage assembly about a support
rotating about a first axis; placing the second stage
assembly inside a toroidal body rotating about a second
axis coaxial with the second stage assembly; and mating
the two assemblies by inserting the first inside the
second.According to European Patent Application
publication n. 0540048 filed by the present Applicant, a
radial tire is produced by forming the second stage
assembly of the tire on the inner surface of a toroidal
body; separately forming the first stage assembly of the
tire; and assembling the first stage assembly inside the
toroidal body and on the inner surface of the second
stage assembly.Despite the above known method being devised for
the express purpose of immediately imparting a toroidal
shape to the component parts of the tire inside the
forming mold, as opposed to subsequent shaping which 
inevitably results in a lack of symmetry, it is
obviously impossible to produce first and second stage
assemblies, and hence tires, that are perfectly
balanced.It is an object of the present invention to perfect
the above known assembly method, with a view to
minimizing unbalance of the finished tires produced
thereby.According to the present invention, there is
provided a method for assembling first and second stage
assemblies of road vehicle tires, the method comprising
phases consisting in placing the first stage assembly
about a first support rotating about a first axis;
placing the second stage assembly inside a second
support comprising a toroidal body rotating about a
second axis coaxial with the second stage assembly; and
mating the two assemblies by inserting the first stage
assembly inside the second stage assembly; characterized
by the fact that it comprises further phases consisting
in rotating the first and second stage assemblies about
their respective axes, for detecting the respective
unbalance vectors; the first stage assembly being
inserted inside the second stage assembly after
arranging the two assemblies in such relative angular
positions as to minimize the resultant unbalance vector
of the assembled tire. A non-limiting embodiment of the present invention
will be described by way of example with reference to
the accompanying drawings, in which:

<CLAIMS>
A method for assembling first and second stage
assemblies (5, 3) of road vehicle tires, the method

comprising phases consisting in placing the first stage
assembly (5) about a first support (52) rotating about a

first axis (49a); placing the second stage assembly (3)
inside a second support (7) comprising a toroidal body

(7) rotating about a second axis (8) coaxial with the
second stage assembly (3); and mating the two assemblies

(5, 3) by inserting the first stage assembly (5) inside
the second stage assembly (3); characterized by the fact

that it comprises further phases consisting in rotating
the first and second stage assemblies (5, 3) about their

respective axes (49a, 8), for detecting the respective
unbalance vectors; the first stage assembly (5) being

inserted inside the second stage assembly (3) after
arranging the two assemblies (5, 3) in such relative

angular positions as to minimize the resultant unbalance
vector of the assembled tire.
A method as claimed in Claim 1, characterized by
the fact that the first stage assembly (5) is inserted

inside the second stage assembly (3) by maintaining the
two assemblies (5, 3) angularly fixed in relation to

their respective axes (49a, 8); rotating the supports
(7, 52) in relation to each other by a given angle about

a third axis (21) perpendicular to the first (49a) and 
second (8) axes; moving the supports (7, 52), so angled,

in relation to each other so that the center (C) of one
(52) of the supports (7, 52) coincides with the center

(C') of the other support (7); and rotating the supports
(7, 52) in relation to each other about the third axis

(21) to zero said angle.
A method as claimed in Claim 2, characterized by
the fact that said angle is close to 45Â°.
A method as claimed in any one of the foregoing
Claims, characterized by the fact that the unbalance

vector of each said assembly (5)(3) is determined by
rotating the respective support (52)(7) alone about the

respective axis (49a)(8) for determining the unbalance
vector of the support (52)(7); rotating said support

(52)(7) together with the respective assembly (5)(3) for
determining the unbalance vector of the support (52)(7)

in combination with the respective assembly (5)(3); and
determining the unbalance vector of the assembly (5)(3)

as a function of the difference between said two
previously determined vectors.
