<ABSTRACT>
Asynchronous switching network for a communications installation kernel (1) including packet-mode support units (2, 3, 6) directly or indirectly interconnected in point-to-point mode by links (L) which are physically structured and managed in terms of time in an identical way. It includes a traffic regulation system including access control means (14, 8, 16) specific to each packet-mode support unit, in order to allow every unit to fix the order of communication of the packets sent to it by the other packet-mode support units. Each transmission of a packet by one unit to another involves the sending of a request by the unit wishing to send to the unit with which it wants to communicate and the sending of an agreement in the opposite direction from the latter, for each of the packet elements separately transmitted between these units.

Asynchronous switching network for a communication installation core (1)
comprising packet mode units (2, 3, 6) directly or indirectly interconnected by

point-to-point links (L) having exactly the same physical structure and temporarily
managed in exactly the same manner, comprising a traffic control system

including distributed access control means (14, 8, 16) in each packet mode unit
to enable said unit to set the order of communication of packets sent to it by the

other packet mode units according to constraints specific to it and imposed
temporarily or permanently and/or constraints reported to it by the other units

with which it communicates, each transmission of a packet from a packet mode
unit to another packet mode unit requiring the sending of a request by the unit

requiring to send to the unit with which it requires to communicate and the
sending of an acquiescence in the opposite direction from the latter for each of

the packet elements separately transmitted between said units.
Asynchronous switching network according to claim 1 wherein each packet
element separately transmitted between units is encapsulated in a fixed size cell

having a header for transmission within the installation between packet mode

units, said network comprising a traffic control system provided with means (8,
22, 12, 19, 25) enabling the sending of individual requests from each packet

mode unit by insertion of specific request data into the header of encapsulated
cells sent from the unit in question, each request sent in an encapsulated cell

header including a priority indication supplied by the sending unit.
Asynchronous switching network according to claim 2 comprising a traffic control
system provided with distributed send storage means (20, 21, 23) in each packet

mode unit for temporarily storing the encapsulated cells to be sent according to
individual priorities determined for said cells at said unit and optionally for

dissociating the encapsulated cells relating to "connected" mode traffic, implying
transmission between packet mode units with given time constraints, from those

relating to "connectionless" mode traffic with less severe constraints.
Asynchronous switching network according to claim 3 comprising a traffic control
system provided with distributed temporary send storage means (26) in each

packet mode unit for storing in separate stacks requests and acquiescences to be
sent to other packet mode units.
Asynchronous switching network according to claim 3 comprising a traffic control
system provided with distributed temporary receive storage means (27, 29) in 

each packet mode unit for separately recovering requests and acquiescences sent
to said unit in the headers of the encapsulated cells that it receives from other

units and the other elements of the received encapsulated cells.
Asynchronous switching network according to claim 5 wherein additional storage
means (30, 31) are associated with the temporary storage means in each packet

mode unit for storing in separate stacks the elements of encapsulated cells
received relating to "connected" mode traffic and those relating to

"connectionless" mode traffic.
Asynchronous switching network according to claims 3 and 5 wherein the send
(23) and receive (29) temporary storage means are respectively divided into a

plurality of parallel modules (23A through 23D, 29A through 29D) to enable
separate storage of encapsulated cells according to the units to which said cells

are respectively to be sent or from which they are to be received and to authorize
interleaved transmission of encapsulated cells either sent to different destination

units or received from different sending units.
Asynchronous switching network according to at least one of the preceding
claims wherein the packet mode units (2, 3, 6) each have two bidirectional links

(L) which are separately connected each to one of the two units of a pair of
broadband switching units (7, 7') to which all the packet mode units are

connected for point-to-point communication therebetween via one or other of
said switching units.
