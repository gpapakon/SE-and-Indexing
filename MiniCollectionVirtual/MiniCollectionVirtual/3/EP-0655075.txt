<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a curable epoxy vinylester composition 
which cures with a low peak exotherm within commercially acceptable processing times. The 
invention further relates to a method of curing an epoxy vinylester resin 
composition under conditions such that the resin cures with a low peak exotherm in a few 
hours or less. Epoxy vinylester resins are well-known in the art. Such resins 
are useful as the continuous matrix in composite applications, and in the fabrication of molded 
parts. The resins suffer from the problem that during cure an exothermic reaction occurs 
leading to a high peak exotherm. When used to make thick or large parts or laminates the high 
peak exotherm can cause serious problems in that thermal stress induced in the structure causes 
it to crack. Japanese Patent Application JP-A-52 051 489 discloses curing of unsaturated polyester 
resins with an organic peroxide in the presence of an organo metallic compound, alicyclic beta 
diketones and an amine. It is disclosed that the composition improves the curing speed and 
that the products are hardly discolored with good workability. U.S. Patent 4,309,511 discloses curing an unsaturated polyester resin composition 
which contains an unsaturated comonomer. The claimed improvement is the use of a cure 
promoter comprising a cobalt salt, a copper salt and a heterocyclic amine. It is disclosed that 
the cure promoter provides a very fast accelerator system when used in conjunction with 
peroxide to give cure times of 5 to 15 minutes and that in the uncatalyzed state the resin has a 
shelf life of 80 to 150 days. It is further disclosed that little or no color is imparted to the resin. JP-A-50 005 490 describes curable resin compositions based on unsaturated polyester 
(A), styrene (B), bipyridine (C), Cu naphthenate (D), hydroquinone (E), diethylaniline 
(F), methyl ethyl ketone peroxide (G) and Co naphthenate (H) which are cured at 25° C. JP-A-57 034 606 discloses electroconductive compositions comprising epoxy-acrylate 
resin (A), chelating agent (C), copper salt (D), inhibitor (E) and Cu metal powder or 
flake. This composition is used as additive to paint composition, adhesive agent or 
printing ink composition.  
 What is needed is a curable epoxy vinylester resin composition, 
that cures within reasonable times at low peak exotherms. What is further needed is a method 
of curing epoxy vinylester compositions wherein the peak 
exotherm of the cure cycle is low and the time period for cure is short enough to facilitate 
reaso
