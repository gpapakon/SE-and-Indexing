<ABSTRACT>
A support housing (1) for valve and closure members, in particular for heart valve prosthesis, has a base ring (2) which carries at least two symmetrically offset stays (4/5) substantially oriented in the direction of the ring axis and mutually linked by two curved strips (3) for securing at least two flexible webs (6, 7). In order to produce with such a support housing a valve or closure member, in particular a heart valve prosthesis, which has a reliable operation even with different closing pressure differentials, specially in variable physiologial stress conditions, the support housing (1) is only section-wise retained with a limited flexibility. For that purpose, the free ends of the stays (4) are rigid, and/or the bases of the stays have a flexibility limited by stops and/or the strips (3) have a flexibility limited by stops.

<CLAIMS>
Stent (1) for implantable valve and closure members, in
particular for heart valve protheses, having a base ring

(2) which carries at least two posts (4), preferably
symmetrically offset relative to one another,

substantially oriented in the direction of the ring axis
and linked together by curved strips (3) for securing at

least two flexible webs, characterised by the bases of the
posts and/or the strips having a flexibility limited by

stops.
Stent according to claim 1, characterised by a rigid form
of the free ends of the posts, preferably by an

accumulation of material.
Stent according to claim 1 or 2, characterised by a
prismatic inner overlay on the free ends of the posts.
Stent according to claim 3, characterised in that the
inner overlay (8) has a triangular cross-section and

tapers concavely on both sides, in the form of a prism
tapering to a point towards the base of the stent.
Stent according to claim 3 or claim 4, characterised in
that the posts have a trapezium cross-section with the

shorter side of the trapeziform on the outside and that
the inner overlay (8) adjoins the longer side of the

trapezium, with the triangular apex of its cross-section
pointing inwards.
Stent according to one or more of claims 3 to 5,
characterised in that the inner overlay (8) tapers in

cross-section from the web attachement positions at first
triangularly or convexly on both sides and then further

triangularly or concavely on both sides, so that the
commissure region of the closed web gradually deviates 

with small bending angles and is in addition supported by
the wings of the inner overlay, which taper into the stent

wall at the upstream end.
Stent according to one or more of claims 3 to 5,
characterised by the posts (4/5) being formed integrally

with their respective inner overlays (8).
Stent according to one or more of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that posts (4/5) and strips (3) are

rounded off at the transition between the web securing
surfaces (backing surfaces) (11) and the cylindrical outer

wall of the stent.
Stent according to one or more of claims 1 to 7,
characterised in that the backing surfaces (11) of the

strips (3) and of the ends of the posts (4) for receiving
the webs (6/7) are singly curved between the inner and

outer walls of the stent (1), are inclined outwardly and
are oriented tangentially to the stent (1)
Stent according to one or more of claims 1 to 9,
characterised in that the posts (4/5) have apertures in

their base region such that they and the strips (3) which
connect their tips to a kind of crown and are arched

towards the base ring (2) are only connected to the base
ring (2) by the way of stays (5).
Stent according to claim 10, characterised by having a
respective vertical stay under each post end (4).
Stent according to claim 10, characterised by having
stays (5) in the form of a V under each post end (4), each

post (4/5) being connected by way of two respective
stays (5) for the greatest possible flexibility (radial

contractibility of the stent posts) with minimal pressure
differentials. 
Stent according to one or more of claims 1 to 12,
characterised by having a coaxial stop ring (9) in the

region of the base ring (2).
Stent according to claim 12, characterised in that the
stop ring (9) and the base ring (2) are connected

integrally together.
Stent according to claim 13 or claim 14, characterised by
having a circumferential groove in the stop ring (9).
Stent according to claim 15, characterised by having at
least one at least partially circumferential lip (16) on

the outside in the base region of the stent post engaging
freely movably in the groove (14) in the stop ring (9).
Stent according to claim 16, characterised in that the
lip or lips (16) is or are provided on the outer side of

the stays (5).
Stent according to one or more of claims 15 to 17,
characterised by at least one at least partially

circumferential recess (17) in the segment bows or
strips (3), and/or in the stop ring (9) associates in such

a way that the ring (9) serves as stop for the strips (3).
Stent according to one or more claims 1 to 18,
characterised by having a diffuser shape.
Stent according to claim 19, characterised by having a
conical shape opening towards the post ends (4) with cone

angles between 2° and 14°, the contraction of the stent
into a cylindrical configuration being limited.
Stent according to one or more of claims 1 to 20,
characterised in that the limit of the contractibility of

the stent posts (3/4) into the cylindrical state is 
reached at pressure differentials between 266 and 3990 Pa

(2 and 33 mm Hg).
Stent according to one or more of claims 1 to 21,
characterised in that it is integrated in a conduit valve

implant which takes the form of a cylindrical hose forming
a prolongation of the stent on the upstream and downstream

sides.
