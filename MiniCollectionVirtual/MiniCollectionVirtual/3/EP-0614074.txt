<ABSTRACT>
An object of this invention is to provide a compact and low-cost optical wavelength measuring instrument, in which mechanical 

movements are eliminated to improve reliability, measuring speed and measuring accuracy. The optical wavelength measuring 
instrument utilizes a group delay dispersion medium having wavelength dependence. Light to be measured is introduced to 

an optical modulator (1) for intensity modulation using a reference signal from a signal source (2). The modulated light is passed 
through the group delay dispersion medium (3) so as to provide a delay corresponding to the wavelength, and converted to an 

electric signal by a photoelectric convertor (4). A phase difference between the reference signal and this electric signal is determined 
by a phase comparator (5) so as to convert the wavelength of light to be measured. The wavelength of light to be measured 

can be converted by using another reference signal, such as reference light, to which the same optical intensity modulation and 
the same delay are applied, or delayed light to be measured.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a light wavelength measuring 
apparatus for use in an optical communication 
system, an apparatus for studying light, or the like. Most conventional light wavelength measuring 
apparatuses employ a Michelson interferometer. The 
basic constitution of a light wavelength measuring apparatus 
using the Michelson interferometer is shown in 
FIG. 1 In FIG. 1, the measured light I/P (wavelength: 位in) 
is mixed with reference light R/P (wavelength: 位ref) 
whose wavelength is considerably shorter than that of 
the measured light I/P by a first half mirror 81, and 
the mixed light is distributed to two systems by a 
second half mirror 82 of the Michelson interferometer. The light of one of the systems is reflected by a 
fixed mirror 83 and then returned to the second half 
mirror 82. The light of the other system is incident 
upon a movable mirror 84. The movable mirror 84 periodically 
moves back and forth along the optical axis 
within a predetermined range. As a result, the light 
incident upon the movable mirror 83 is returned to the 
second half mirror 82 owing to the movement of the  
 
movable mirror. The reflected light of the fixed mirror 83 and that 
of the movable mirror 84 are mixed with each other by 
the second half mirror 82, and the mixed light enters a 
WDM (Wavelength-Division Multiplexing) device 85 and is 
divided for each wavelength. The light of wavelength 
位in and that of wavelength 位ref are converted 
into electrical signals by photoelectric converters 
(photodiodes) 86 and 87, respectively, and these signals 
are transmitted to counter circuits 88 and 89. The counter circuits 88 and 89 detect the respective 
peak timings of the input signals to count peak 
timing signals of the light components during one cycle 
of movement of the movable mirror 84. The values 
counted by the counter circuits 88 and 89 are supplied 
to a wavelength calculation unit 810. The wavelength calculation unit 810 calculates the 
number of peaks of wavelength interference patterns of 
the measured light and reference light on the basis of a 
ratio of the values of measured light components counted 
by the counter circuit 88 to those of reference light 
components counted by the counter circuit 89, thereby 
measuring the wavelength of the measured light based on 
the number of peaks. Since, however, the above-described light wavelength 
measuring apparatus using the Michelson 
interferometer has a mechanical movable section for 
moving the mirror, the maximum measurement speed is 
restrict
