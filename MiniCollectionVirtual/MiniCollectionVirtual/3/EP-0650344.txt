<ABSTRACT>
The osteosynthetic securing component (10) in the form of a pedicle screw or spinal hook has a lower section (2) which can be anchored to the bone and an upper section (3), joined thereto in its longitudinal axis (1), which is completely traversed by a through channel (8) transversely to the longitudinal axis (1) to accept an elongate support (40). The upper section (3) has an internal (5) and an external (9) thread to accept a locking component (30; 50) blocking the elongate support (40). The upper section (3) is fitted at its upper end (6) or at the inserted locking component (30; 50) with a connecting mechanism (4, 5, 7; 11; 12) which is releasable and stable in rotation, to provide a positive frictional temporary attachment for a manipulation device (20).
