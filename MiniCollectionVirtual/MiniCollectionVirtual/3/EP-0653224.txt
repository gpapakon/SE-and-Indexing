<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a device for classifying
heart rhythms of a patient
based on the shape (morphology) of the endocardial or
epicardial electrogram. More particularly, a number of
features (metrics) of the electrogram are measured to
form a description of the shape of individual
electrograms, and the metrics are then converted into a
cardiac rhythm diagnosis by means of a pattern
classification technique.There are a number of ways to discriminate different
types of heart rhythm in an implantable cardiverter
defibrillator (ICD). The most obvious way to do this is
to use heart rate information alone, in the manner shown
for example in U.S. Patent No. 4,475,551 to Langer et
al., entitled "Arrhythmia Detection and Defibrillation
System and Method", which issued October 9, 1984. The
purpose of discriminating different rhythms in an ICD
device is to allow the device to respond appropriately to
each of them. Problems occur if there are two or more
rhythms which require a different response from the
device but cannot easily be discriminated from one
another.The rhythms which cause most problems in existing
ICD devices are atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus
tachycardia (ST). Both of these rhythms can result in a
ventricular rate that is high enough for it to be
considered to be ventricular tachycardia (VT). Thus, VT
cannot be discriminated from AF or ST on the basis of
ventricular rate alone. Additional information must be
used to correctly identify these rhythms. As discussed in an article by Arzbaecher et al., entitled
"Automatic Tachycardia Recognition", appearing in PACE,
May-June 1984, Volume 7 (II), pages 541-547, and in an
article by Jenkins et al., entitled "Tachycardia Detection
in Implantable Antitachycardia Devices", appearing in PACE,
Volume 7 (II), pages 1273-1277, November-December 1984,
atrial fibrillation can be readily identified by looking at
the ratio of the atrial rate to the ventricular rate. This
requires the use of an atrial lead, however, which may be
undesirable or unavailable. Also, this method is unsuited
to discrimination of ST and VT, since both rhythms may
exhibit a 1:1 ratio of atrial to ventricular rate.Timing methods have been proposed for distinguishing ST
or AF from VT (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,830,006 to
Haluska et al., entitled "Implantable Cardiac Stimulator for
Detection and Treatment of Ventricular Arrhythmias", which
issued on May 16, 1989, and see, e.g., an article by Camm et
al., entitled "Tachycardia Recognition by Implantable Electronic
Devices", appearing

<CLAIMS>
A device for classifying heart rhythms of a patient by means of
electrogram morphology, comprising:


means for providing an electrogram of a patient's heart rhythm;
means for determining at least two morphology-defining metrics derived
from a QRS complex (20) of said electrogram, said electrogram having a width

and an amplitude, said metrics defining the shape of said electrogram including at
least one of said width and amplitude; and
means for comparing the metrics of said given heartbeat with the
corresponding metrics of a stored set of said at least two morphology-defining

metrics of a normal electrogram;
characterised by
:

means for establishing bounds of normal variation for said metrics which
are combined to define a decision surface that includes first and second regions

such that said first region represents normal heartbeats and said second region
represents abnormal heartbeats, established from said stored set of said at least

two morphology-defining metrics of a normal electrogram;

   wherein said comparing means is operable to decide which of said regions
said given heartbeat falls into and to classify said given heartbeat as either normal

or abnormal based on said decision; and

   means for diagnosing the patient's heart rhythm as ventricular arrhythmia
if a number of said given heartbeats are classified as abnormal.
A device according to claim 1, wherein said determining means further
includes means for determining a first set of at least three metrics selected from a

group of metrics that includes: a MOD metric (22, 24), which comprises the
absolute area under a QRS complex (20) of said electrogram; a PK metric (28), 

which comprises the value of the largest excursion of said QRS complex (20)
from its baseline, said value having the same polarity as said excursion; a PVE

metric (28), which comprises the amplitude of the largest positive deflection of
said QRS complex (20); a NVE metric (30), which comprises the amplitude of

the largest negative deflection of said QRS complex (20); a PKP metric, which
comprises the peak-to-peak amplitude of said QRS complex (20); a DIF metric,

which comprises the difference between the absolute amplitudes of the largest
positive deflection of said QRS complex (20) and the largest negative deflection

of said QRS complex (20); a FIL metric, which comprises the peak-to-peak
amplitude of said QRS complex (20) after said complex has passed through a

bandpass filter having a center frequency of about 25 Hz; a SSA metric, which
comprises a signed-square area metric in which a,plurality of samples taken of

said QRS complex (20) are squared, their signs are restored, the signed squares
are summed, the square root of the absolute value of the sum is taken, and the

sign is restored thereto; a QRS metric, which comprises a QRS angle Θ calculated
from the amplitude and temporal order of the largest positive and largest negative

peaks of the QRS complex (20), as follows:

r = abs (smaller peak) ÷ (larger peak),
 = arcos (r),

and

   if the first peak is positive and larger, Θ = ,

   if the first peak is positive and smaller, Θ = -,
