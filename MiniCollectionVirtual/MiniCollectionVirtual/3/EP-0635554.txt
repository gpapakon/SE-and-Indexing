<ABSTRACT>
Disclosed is a method for forming protective 
coatings on optical fibers. The method comprises coating 

the fiber with hydrogen silsesquioxane resin and then 
facilitating gelation of the coating. The resultant coated 

fibers have improved moisture resistance and can be handled 
without damage.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention is a method of protecting
optical fibers using hydrogen silsesquioxane resin and it
also relates to the resultant fibers having these coatings
thereon.The manufacture of optical fibers generally
comprises a process in which the fiber is drawn from a
melted preform of the desired glass and then wound around a
take-up drum. A protective fiber cladding is generally
applied at a later stage of fabrication. Often, however,
the fiber is damaged prior to cladding by winding, handling,
transportation and the like. For instance, friction and
wear often cause mechanical damage to the fibers as they are
wound on the take-up spool.A number of materials have been tried in an
attempt to prevent this damage. For instance, materials
such as epoxies, urethanes, acrylates, polyesters,
fluoroplastics and silicones have been applied to the virgin
fibers prior to winding. Such materials, however, are often
difficult to process (e.g., remove prior to cladding) and
are often not effective.The use of hydrogen silsesquioxane for the
protection of electronic devices is also known in the art in EP-A-0 427 395
and US-A-4,756,977. Processes for forming coatings on
electronic devices are described therein which comprise
diluting hydrogen silsesquioxane in solvents, applying the
solutions to substrates, evaporating the solvents and
heating the coated substrates to a temperature of 150 to
1000°C. US-A-2 466 413 discloses the preparation of organohalosilanes
by reacting hydrocarbon halides and silicon powder,
wherein the distribution, by weight, and the particle size
are as follows: 100 % of the particles are smaller than 420
microns in diameter, from 90 to 100 % of the particles are
less than 149 microns in diameter and not more than 60 % of
the particles are less than 4 microns in diameter, in the
presence of a metallic catalyst, especially copper, having a
specific particle size and distribution.JP-A-57-125905 discloses a polymer cladding optical fiber
coated with polysilsesquioxane or mixed resins of
polysilsesquioxane and polydimethylsiloxane on the surface
of a quarz core which coating further is coated with a
polymer cladding made by using nylon resin or the like as a
jacket layer. The present invention teaches a method for the use
of hydrogen silsesquioxane for the formation of protective
coatings on optical fibers.The present invention provides a method of
protecting optical fibers. The method comprises coating the
fiber with a composition comprising hydrogen silsesquioxane
resin and a solvent followed
