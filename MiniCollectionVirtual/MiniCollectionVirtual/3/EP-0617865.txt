<ABSTRACT>
In this embedded signalling system a sequence of code symbols representing digital information is generated (100). A code signal representing this sequence is generated (200), which is dynamically filtered to form a modified code signal (300), which is combined (400) with a higher level audio signal to form a composite audio signal for transmission.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an embedded
signalling system and more particularly, to a system for
embedding a code signal in an audio signal in a manner
such that the composite signal is not readily
distinguishable from the original audio signal by
listening and in a manner such that the code signal
cannot be readily removed or obscured without
simultaneously degrading the quality of the audio signal.There are numerous reasons for providing a system or
means for readily identifying the source of an audio
signal. In the music and recording industries in
particular, such a system is desired:
for automatic broadcast performance accounting and
auditing of air play to assist with market planning for auditing released product from licensed tracks
to confirm their sourcefor administrative control of music tracks in studio
and manufacturing operationsfor determining the source of unauthorized master
releasefor auditing electronic delivery channels to
establish proper royalty paymentfor proof of original track where a sound-alike is
claimed for detecting sampled music tracks which are
incorporated in new sound recordings for controlling authorization to copy for identifying copyright infringement by direct
copying and for automatically cataloging the contents of an
audio library. As will be understood, it is highly desirable that
the identifying information utilized by such a system not
be easily deleted or obscured, e.g., by the adding in of
additional audio material or by the re-recording of the
material onto a different media. Systems that rely on a 
proprietary adaptation of the digital format used for
recording audio signals in various high quality media
such as compact discs and digital audio tape (DAT) are
subject to such problems since once the original digital
recording is converted to analog form, the identifying
information is typically lost or no longer recoverable. US-A-4,972,471 discloses a method of encoding multifrequency
signals, especially those to be recorded and played back, with
identification information in a way as to be readily extracted from the
encoded signal in a machine readable form and the implementing
apparatus. While it is thus desirable that the identifying
information be permanently and inseparably intertwined
with the original audio signal, it is also important that
the presence of the code signal representing this
information not interfere with the usual intended use of
the audio signal, e.g., by not degrading the quality of
an audio signal intended for entertainment.Among
