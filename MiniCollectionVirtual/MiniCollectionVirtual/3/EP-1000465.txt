<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a transducer with surface acoustic waves wherein an etched grid is overlaid on the standard electrode arrays of acoustic transducers. The overlay of said arrays enables to obtain a preferential direction for the propagation of the acoustic waves while maintaining a high quality factor Q comparable to that of standard birectional transducers. The invention is applicable to mobile radio communication.
