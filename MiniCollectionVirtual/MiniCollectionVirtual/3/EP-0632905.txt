<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates primarily to lenses composed of a
single material and to systems employing such lenses. More
particularly, it relates to designs for such lenses which, when used
singly or as part of a system, have the property that certain of their
optical characteristics remain relatively unchanged with changes in
temperature or change in a controlled predetermined way.Correction of lens aberrations normally requires the use of
multiple component lenses even when thermal effects are not a
dominant factor. However, there have been some simple designs
reported for use over modest temperature ranges where just portions
of a single element lens can correct a specific aberration. For example,
chromatic aberrations have been corrected by using a single element
lens with a conventional refractive or "bulk" portion, and a shallow
surface diffractive portion. Here, the diffractive portion reduces the
chromatic aberrations introduced by the bulk portion. (W.C. Sweatt,
Applied Optics, Vol. 16, No. 5, May (1977).However, if thermal effects cannot be ignored because
they affect performance due to unacceptable changes due to thermal 
changes in material or geometric properties of a lens, designs for
compensating for them i.e., athermalized designs can of necessity
become quite complicated. For example, plastic and glass optical
materials may change enough so that corresponding changes in focal
length or the state of correction of a lens can become intolerable. This
is so in part because these materials, especially plastic exhibit large
changes in refractive index with temperature changes.Designers have made lens systems less sensitive to these
temperature effects by exploiting the differences in which changes in
refractive index or geometry occur in one or more elements to
compensate for those introduced by others. This approach, when
properly implemented, can result in a thermally balanced arrangement.
For example, if it were important to maintain back focal length in a
multiple component lens constant over a given temperature, a designer
could adjust the properties of individual elements of the lens in such a
way the thermally induced increases to back focal length were
balanced or offset by the decreases in others. This could be done by
control of the thermal properties of lens element geometry or index, or
both.Such compensation may be important, for example, in arrangements
used to focus laser beams onto the surfaces of compact
disks. An aspherical optical lens incorporating a kinoform for
