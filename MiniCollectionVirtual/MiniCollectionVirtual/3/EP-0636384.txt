<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a balloon catheter comprising a tube-like 
basic member (2) with a distal and a proximal end and at least two 

lumens each of which is connected to a connecting piece (5,8) by a 
single catheter section (4,7) at the proximal end. A balloon-shaped 

member (10) is attached close to the distal end of which an internal 
space is connected to one of the lumens through which it can be filled 

with fluid. A pressure gauge (9) has been received in the single 
catheter section (7) leading to the balloon-shaped member.

<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a balloon catheter. Such 
a catheter comprises a tube-like basic member with a distal 
and a proximal end and at least two lumens. At the proximal 
end each lumen is connected by a single catheter section to 
a connecting piece. A balloon-shaped member of which the 
inside is connected to one of the lumens, is attached to the 
distal end. Via the single catheter section connected with 
this lumen and the connecting piece, a fluid under pressure 
can be supplied to and removed from the balloon-shaped 
member in order to cause the balloon-shaped member to swell 
to a greater or lesser degree. Balloon catheters of this type are generally known 
and are used for instance to dilate narrowed blood vessels. 
For this purpose the catheter is introduced in a patient and 
the balloon positioned in the area of the narrowing. By 
subsequently supplying fluid under pressure via the 
connecting piece concerned, the balloon-shaped member will 
expand, thus pushing the narrowing outwards. With such a treatment it is essential that the 
fluid supplied to the balloon-shaped member is of the right 
pressure. When there is not enough pressure, dilatation will 
be insufficient whereas there will be a danger of trauma 
when the pressure is too great. The use of such a balloon 
catheter requires therefore great skill on the part of the 
attending physician. The object of the invention is to provide a 
balloon catheter of the type described in the preamble which 
can be used to carry out the treatment with a greater chance 
of success. This is achieved with the catheter as 
characterized in claim 1. A pressure gauge can be made 
simple and tractable, hence not impeding the treatment. The 
pressure gauge will give the performing physician a clear  
 
indication of the pressure in the balloon, so that the 
treatment can be carried out effectively. The pressure gauge 
forms part of the connection line to the balloon, providing 
a very manageable assembly. A particular advantageous embodiment is 
characterized in claim 2. The pressure acts on both piston 
parts, thus creating a reaction force directed at the small 
diameter of the piston. The force increases proportionally 
with the pressure. A spring working against the movement of 
the piston is consequently pushed in proportionally to the 
pressure, giving an indication of the prevailing pressure. An advantageous further development is 
characterized in claim 3. The piston can be seen directly 
through the transparent housing, so that this in itself can

<CLAIMS>
Balloon catheter comprising a tube-like basic 
member with a distal and a proximal end and at least two 

lumens each of which is connected to a connecting piece by a 
single catheter section at the proximal end and wherein a 

balloon-shaped member is attached close to the distal end of 
which an internal space of which is connected to one of the 

lumens through which it can be filled with fluid and wherein 
a pressure gauge has been received in the single catheter 

section leading to the balloon-shaped member, said pressure 
gauge comprising an elongated housing with an inlet and an 

outlet placed axially opposite each other, wherein a piston 
is received, movable against a spring by the pressure to be 

measured, and wherein the piston and a scale division work 
together either directly or indirectly, for indicating the 

measured pressure. 
Balloon catheter as claimed in claim 1, wherein 
the inside of the rectangular housing comprises a first 

axial cylinder bore and opposite to that a second axial 
cylinder bore with a smaller diameter, the piston comprises 

two parts working together with the cylinder bores 
respectively and wherein a continuous channel has been 

formed from the inlet through the first cylinder bore, 
axially through the piston, through the second cylinder bore 

to the outlet. 
Balloon catheter as claimed in claim 1 or 2, 
wherein the housing has been manufactured of a transparent 

plastic material and to a wall of which a scale division has 
been arranged, working together with an edge of the piston. 
Balloon catheter as claimed in claim 3, wherein 
at the scale division the housing has a cross-section with a 

polygonal shape with rounded corners.
