projector for projecting light onto a coin, a light receiver 

for receiving light reflected by the coin and producing 
pattern data of the coin, pattern data memory for storing 

the pattern data as mapped into an x-y coordinate system, a 
center coordinate calculator for determining a center coordinate 

of the pattern data mapped in the x-y coordinate 
system in the pattern data memory, a pattern data converter 

for, based upon the center coordinate of the pattern data in 
the x-y coordinate system, the pattern data stored in the 

pattern data memory into an r-ϑ coordinate system and producing 
converted pattern data, a reference pattern data 

memory for storing reference pattern data mapped in the r-ϑ 
coordinate system and a coin discriminator for correcting 

the converted pattern data along a ϑ-axis and comparing the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a coin discriminating 
apparatus and, in particular, to a coin discriminating 
apparatus for discriminating coins by optically detecting 
coin surface patterns. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 5-46840 
proposes a coin discriminating apparatus which optically 
detects the surface patterns of coins and compares them with 
reference patterns, thereby discriminating the denominations 
of coins, the genuineness of coins, whether or not coins are 
foreign coins and the like. In this coin discriminating apparatus, coin discrimination 
is made as follows. Light is projected onto a coin at 
a shallow angle and light reflected by the coin is detected 
to obtain optical data that are converted to binary image 
data. The thus obtained binary image data are divided into 
sets of binary image area data corresponding to a plurality 
of annular areas of the coin surface. Then, from among sets 
of reference binary data which have been determined for 
respective predetermined annular areas and for each coin 
denomination, the sets of reference binary data of a coin 
having the same outer diameter as that of the coin being 
discriminated are selected and the sets of binary image area 
data are compared with the sets of reference binary image 
area data of the corresponding annular areas as the sets of 
binary image area data are rotated to the angles where the  
 
sets of binary image area data are most similar to the 
corresponding sets of reference binary image area data. If 
the thus obtained angles for all sets of binary image area 
data coincide, it is discriminated that the denomination of 
the coin coincides with that of the selected reference 
binary data and, otherwise, it is discriminated that the 
coin is counterfeit or foreign and unacceptable. According to this coin discriminating apparatus, the 
surface of a coin is divided into a plurality of annular 
areas and when the surface pattern of each annular area 
coincides with the reference pattern of the corresponding 
annular area of a coin having the same outer diameter, it is 
discriminated that the denomination of the coin coincides 
with that of the selected reference pattern, whereas, otherwise, 
it is discriminated that the coin is unacceptable. In 
order to achieve high discrimination accuracy, therefore, it 
is necessary to divide the coin surface into numerous narrow 
annular areas. On the other hand, if the surface of a coin 
is divided into many narrow annular areas, it is necessary 
to obtain a separate
