<ABSTRACT>
There are disclosed various forms of structure simulating body tissue for use in practising surgical and/or clinical techniques. In one form, a composite pad comprises a pad (2) of elastomeric material bonded via a bonding layer (4) to a thin sheet of foam latex rubber simulating epidermis. A kit for use with such pads is also disclosed.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of making a 
simulation of body tissue for use in practising surgical 
and/or clinical techniques. In the medical field, it is necessary for students, 
doctors and surgeons to be able to practise surgical and 
clinical techniques. More particularly, there is the 
need to practise the making of incisions, the removal of 
various kinds of complaint (such as cysts, haematomas and 
melanomas, for example), access to venous structures 
below the epidermis and the insertion of sutures. As an 
alternative to providing an actual body or part of an 
actual body for practising such techniques, there is a 
need for artificial means whereby they can be practised. 
Known structures providing simulations of body tissue 
suffer from the disadvantage that they are not 
sufficiently analogous, either visually or physically, to 
actual body tissue. As prior art, there may be mentioned US-A-4 481 001 which 
discloses a human skin model for training/demonstration 
purposes comprising a subcutaneous tissue-simulating 
layer made of a foamed elastomer, a dermis-simulating 
layer made of a silicone elastomer that contains 
reinforcing fibres and an epidermis simulating layer made 
of rubber latex poured or painted on to the dermis-simulating 
layer and air-cured; GB-A-2 249 738 which 
discloses a foamed product impregnated and cured for use 
in a prosthesis; GB-A-2 243 324 which discloses a method 
of manufacturing a prosthesis from silicone rubber and a 
foamed material; GB-A-2 047 101 which disclose a self-sealing 
injection button for a body implant and having a 
unitary body of cured silicone; and EP-A-0 243 132 which 
discloses the production of artificial skin having a 
cultured epidermal cell layer.  
 According to the present invention, there is provided a 
method of making a simulation of body tissue for use in 
practising surgical and/or clinical techniques, the 
method comprising: 
a) providing a layer comprising a simulated 
epidermis by moulding foam latex rubber 
between first and second mould members; 
allowing the foam latex rubber to gel; 
heating the foam latex rubber; and allowing 
it to cool; and b) applying the foam latex rubber as a relatively 
thin layer over a member of elastomeric 
material.  Said relatively thin layer may be formed to include a 
reinforcement of mesh material, such as woven or knitted 
material. The elastomeric material could be latex foam, which could 
be impregnated with a mixture of a silicone sealant and 
a diluent. Said relatively thin

A method of making a simulation of body tissue for 
use in practising surgical and/or clinical techniques, 

the method comprising: 

a) providing a layer (3) comprising a simulated 
epidermis by moulding foam latex rubber 

between first and second mould members; 
allowing the foam latex rubber to gel; 

heating the foam latex rubber; and allowing it 
to cool; and 
b) applying the foam latex rubber as a relatively 
thin layer over a member (2) of elastomeric 

material. 
A method as claimed in claim 1, wherein said 
relatively thin layer (3) is formed to include a 

reinforcement of mesh material. 
A method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the mesh 
material comprises woven or knitted material. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the member (2) of elastomeric material is latex foam. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
said relatively thin layer (3) is bonded by a bonding 

layer (4) to the member (2) of elastomeric material. 
A method as claimed in claims 4 and 5, wherein said 
relatively thin layer (3) is bonded to the member (2) of 

elastomeric material by a bonding layer (4) comprising a 
mixture of a silicone sealant and a diluent. 
A method as claimed in claim 4 or either of claims 
5 and 6 as dependent on claim 4, wherein the member (2) 

of latex foam is impregnated with a mixture of a silicone 
sealant and a diluent.  

 
A method as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, wherein 
the member of elastomeric material comprises a mixture of 

a silicone sealant and a diluent. 
A method as claimed in any preceding claim, wherein 
the member of elastomeric material includes a simulation 

of a vein structure.
