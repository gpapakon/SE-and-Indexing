<ABSTRACT>
Tamper-indicating device for bottles closed by a stopper, comprising means connected by a breakable zone to a ring connected in a tamper-proof manner to the neck, so that the said means break at the location of the breakable zone when they are brought from a protection position in which they oppose removal of the stopper to a position of release of the stopper. The said means comprise an element (5) of generally circular shape, integral with a linking part (6) connected by a breakable zone (12) to the ring (4) so that, in the protection position, the said element (5) covers the top of the stopper (3) without substantially projecting from the latter, either axially or radially. Application: particularly to bottles containing valuable liquids such as alcohol, perfumes, etc.
