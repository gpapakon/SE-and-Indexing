<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the use of
vaporized hydrogen silsesquioxane to deposit a coating
containing silicon and oxygen. The coating is deposited by
introducing the hydrogen silsesquioxane vapor into a
deposition chamber containing the substrate to be coated and
then inducing reaction of the vapor to form the coating.Numerous silica vapor deposition methods are known
in the art and many are currently used in industry.
Typically, such deposition methods involve decomposing a
silicon source in the presence of oxygen and the substrate to
be coated. For example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is
used to decompose various silanes (eg., SiH4, H2SiCl2, etc.)
in the presence of a source of oxygen (eg., air, oxygen,
ozone, NO2, etc.) for the deposition of protective or
dielectric coatings.Hydrogen silsesquioxane resin is likewise known in
the art. For instance, Collins et al. in U.S. Patent
No. 3,615,272 describe such resins and their method of
manufacture and also includes an example in which individual
volatile components of condensed hydrogen silsesquioxane are
separated from one another by vapour phase chromatography.Similarly, Haluska et al. in U.S. Patent
No. 4,756,977 teach the use of hydrogen silsesquioxane resin
to form ceramic coatings on substrates. These patents,
however. only describe the use of the resin in solution.U.S. Patent No. 5,063,267 assigned to the same
assignee hereof, describes fractionating hydrogen
silsesquioxane resin into narrow molecular weight fractions.
The application describes the low molecular weight fractions
thereof as volatile but does not describe a utility for such
materials.The present inventor has now unexpectedly
discovered that gaseous, low molecular weight hydrogen 
silsesquioxane can be used in conventional vapor deposition
techniques to form silicon and oxygen containing coatings.The present invention provides use of a composition for
depositing a coating containing silicon and oxygen on a
substrate said composition comprising vaporized hydrogen
silsesquioxane in a carrier gas.The present invention is based on the discovery
that volatile fractions of hydrogen silsesquioxane resin can
be used to form coatings on various substrates. The coatings
produced by the techniques described herein are valuable as
protective and dielectric layers on substrates such as
electronic devices.The term hydrogen silsesquioxane resin or H-resin
is used in this application to describe various hydridosilane
resins of the formula HSi(OH)x(OR)yOz/2, in which each R is
independently
