<ABSTRACT>
The object of the present invention is an acoustic chamber for the treatment, at various frequencies and high intensities, of gas effluents which contain 
solid and liquid microparticles in suspension. The acoustic energy agglomerates the microparticles, thereby facilitating the air separation by means of conventional 

ystems (electro-filters, cyclones, etc.). The chamber has a rectangular cross section and is axially traversed by the flow of aerosols to be agglomerated (1) while 
the acoustic generators which are of the stepped vibrating plate type (2) and which may have different frequencies, are contiguously of alternatingly arranged on 

the side walls in order to create intensive stationary fields in the various cross sections of the chamber. In order to maximize the emission of both faces of the radiant 
plate of the acoustic generators, it is proposed to arrange the plate between two forming angle planar reflectors. Additionally, for the treatment of aerosols at high 

temperatures, there is provided a refrigeration system (4) in order to refrigerate the acoustic radiators by means of a cool air flow.

<DESCRIPTION>
Particles suspended in gases coming from industrial emissions or from the exhausts of 
internal combustion engines constitute one of the factors with the greatest impact on 
atmospheric contamination. More specifically, the very fine particles (smaller than 5 micrometers) which 
are very difficult to eliminate with conventional separation technologies represent a major heath 
hazard because of their penetration and adhesion ability to respiratory tissue as well as for their 
general toxicity. At this time, efficient industrial emission control of particulate matter is only 
possible down to particle sizes in the order of some microns by means of electrostatic filters. Acoustic energy offers a new method for elimination of micrometer- and submicrometer-sized 
particles. The Spanish Patent 439.523 indicates how the application of a high intensity acoustic 
field with an appropriate frequency in an aerosol gives raise to an agglomeration processes of 
the particles, which form the aerosol, increasing their size to facilitate in this way their later 
precipitation or separation in a conventional or gravity collector. The process takes advantage 
of the effects of vibration, hydrodynamic interaction, and entrainment which are produced 
between the particles by the action of the acoustic field. The invention object of the present patent refers to an acoustic chamber for treatment of 
gaseous effluents which contain solid or liquid particles in suspension. There are some 
precedents of equipment of this type. The Spanish Patent 459.523 presents a cylindrical 
chamber of which one end incorporates an acoustic emitter of radiating-stepped-plate type and 
the other one a plane reflector paralleling the face side of the emitter. The aerosol to be treated is 
introduced tangentially and it carries out a helicoidal course which, even though favoring the 
particle agglomeration, introduces load losses and provokes turbulent flow. 
EP-A-488097 presents a new chamber type of 
polygonal cross section in which the aerosol enters axially while the acoustic emitter or emitters 
(whose type is not specified) are located at an oblique angle with respect to the chamber axis.  
 
This way, the acoustic radiation is repetitively reflected on the chamber walls until it falls, on 
the other end of the chamber, onto a plane reflector which is also located at an oblique position 
with respect to the axis. This oblique incidence, however, can favor the excitation of multiple 
modes which can produce energy dispersion between the
