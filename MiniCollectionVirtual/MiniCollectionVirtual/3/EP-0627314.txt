<ABSTRACT>
An ink-jet print head (12) for a dot printer, in 
which the drops of ink are expelled from one or more expulsion 

chambers (16) through corresponding pluralities of nozzles (30), 
each plurality communicating with each individual chamber. The 

nozzles (30) communicating with each chamber may be three to 
nine in number and are suitably arranged so as to obtain a high 

print quality in particular for the printing of characters with 
straight edges free from irregularities.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an ink-jet print
head of the type which comprises an expulsion chamber in
communication with a plurality of nozzles for expelling
corresponding droplets of ink and in which at least two of said
nozzles are arranged in a row oriented in a reference direction.US Patent No. 4,611,219 discloses an ink-jet print
head having at least one group of aligned expulsion chambers.Each chamber contains a transducer for causing
expulsion of the ink simultaneously from two nozzles.All the nozzles are aligned in a single row in the
direction of alignment of the chambers, forming a line of
nozzles designed in particular to print an entire line at a time
and hence obtain printing of a complete page with a single
scanning movement.A head of this type, with all the nozzles aligned in
a single row, is able to print, whenever activated, at the most
a continuous, but very thin line with a width equal to the
dimension of each dot.Therefore, in order to print characters or graphic
symbols with a width much greater than the dimension of each
dot, several passing movements are required, hence reducing the
printing speed.From EP-A-225169, an ink-jet print head, according to the preambles of claims
1 and 8, is known in
which a plurality of ejection nozzles corresponding to a
single emission chamber are provided, whereby a plurality of
ink droplets is simultaneously ejected. The nozzles may be
arranged in any predetermined pattern, particularly in a
single linear array, in a couple of linear arrays parallel and
co-linear, at the points of an equilateral triangle, or so as
to correspond with a segment of an alpha-numeric character. A
print head of this type is well suited for printing straight
lines or bars, but not diagonal lines as normally encountered
when printing graphic images. US Patents Nos 4,542,389 and 4,550,326 disclose print
heads of the type mentioned above, in which each compression
chamber has associated with it several openings. Of these
openings only one constitutes the active nozzle for expelling
drops of ink, being arranged in the region of the heating
resistor.Additional openings communicating with the same
pressure chamber are used in order to drain an excess of ink
dispersed by the active nozzle or in order to neutralize reflex
pressure pulses capable of influencing negatively the operation
of active nozzles associated with other adjacent compression 
chambers.These additional openings or orifices have a
completely passive function since they do not expel drops of
ink, not being

<CLAIMS>
An ink-jet print head for a dot printer comprising a
plurality of expulsion chambers (16, 16') for expelling

droplets of ink (31) by means of a pressure, said chambers
having a constant pitch and being aligned in a reference

direction, said chambers having a substantially
parallepiped shape with side walls, a base wall and a

closing wall (26) opposite said base wall; each chamber of
said plurality of expulsion chambers including:


a pressure generating element (14), deposited on said
base, selectively actuatable for generating said pressure

inside said each chamber; and
a plurality of circular nozzles (30, 30a) through
which said droplets of ink are expelled, formed on said

closing wall (26) and communicating with said each
chamber, whereby said pressure generated by said pressure

generating element expels simultaneously a corresponding
plurality of said ink droplets (31) from said each

chamber, said nozzles having a radius R and a centre; said
centre being disposed in a geometrical position

corresponding to a vertex of a polygon;

   characterized in that said plurality of expulsion
chambers (16, 16') is alternatively arranged in a first

row and in a second row parallel to said first row, each
chamber (16) of said plurality of expulsion chambers

arranged in said first row communicating with a first
plurality of nozzles consisting of four nozzles arranged

at the vertices of a first square having a side parallel
to said reference direction; and each chamber (16') of

said plurality of expulsion chambers arranged in said
second row communicating with a second plurality of

nozzles consisting of four nozzles arranged at the 
vertices of a second square having a side inclined at 45°

with respect to said reference direction.
An ink-jet print head according to claim 1,

characterized in that said chambers (16) of said plurality
of expulsion chambers arranged in said first row is offset

by half of said pitch in said reference direction with
respect to said chambers (16') of said plurality of

expulsion chambers in said second row parallel to said
first row.
An ink-jet print head according to claims 1 or 2,
characterised in that a distance d between the centre of

adjacent nozzles of said plurality of circular nozzles
(30) of each said chamber, corresponding to a length of

the sides of said polygon is not lower than 2.2 times said
radius R of said nozzles.
An ink-jet print head according to any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said plurality of

expulsion chambers (16, 16') and said plurality of nozzles
(30) are obtained by subjecting a foil of plastic material

to excimer laser radiation.
An ink-jet print head according to any of the
preceding claims, characterized in that said pressure

generating element (14) comprises an electrically
resistive element.
An ink-jet print head according to claim 5,
characterized in that said resistive element (14)

comprises two resistors connected in series. 
An ink-jet print head according to claim 5,
characterized in that said resistive element (14)

comprises two resistors connected in parallel.
A method for printing graphic symbols with a high
print quality using an ink-jet print head movable into

successive printing positions, said print head being able
to expel droplets of ink (31) in response to a command for

activating the head, for printing on a printing medium
(34) in said printing positions groups of dots (37) having

a diameter D, said method being characterized in
comprising the following steps:


a) providing an ink-jet print head according to
any of the preceding claims;
b) activating said print head for printing said
graphic symbols, depositing in succession said groups of

dots (37) in said printing positions selectively aligned
in said reference direction or in a second direction

perpendicular thereto, so that graphic symbols elongated
in either of said reference and said second direction are

printed with substantially straight edges.
A method according to claim 8, characterised in that
said plurality of nozzles (30) is arranged by having a

distance d of said centres lower than said diameter D of
said dots but higher than 0.4 times said diameter D.
