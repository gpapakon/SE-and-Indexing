<DESCRIPTION>
The invention relates to a compound of the formula

   enantiomers or diastereomers thereof and to pharmaceutically
acceptable salts thereof.The compound of formula I contains two asymmetric centers at the α-and
β-positions. Accordingly, the compound of formula I can be in form of
two racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers, that is, erythro (R*,S*) or
threo (R*,R*) isomers.As used herein, the terms "erythro" and "threo" refer to the relative
configurations of the hydroxy and the methyl substituent, at the α- and β-positions
of the compounds of formula I' and I" as shown below, which are
racemates. However, the enantiomers of the erythro and threo racemates of
formula I' and I" are part of the invention.
The compound of formula I reduces adverse effects of neurotoxic
injury and thus is useful in the treatment of neuro-degenerative diseases,
such as, stroke, ischemia, hypoxia, hypo-glycemia, epilepsy, and the like.The compound of the present invention is new. In J. Med. Chem. 34,
3085, (1991) are described ifenprodil and analog compounds, which differ 
from the compound of the present invention by the length of the linking
group between the phenyl ring and the piperidine group.Objects of the present invention are the compound of formula I and its
pharmaceutically acceptable salts per se and for use as therapeutically
active substances, the manufacture of this compound, a medicament
containing it and the manufacture of such a medicament, as well as the use
of the compound of formula I and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts in
the control or prevention of illnesses or in the improvement of health,
especially in the control or prevention of neurodegenerative diseases, such
as stroke, ischemia, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, epilepsy, and the like.Exemplary compounds enclosed in the present invention are:
(R*,S*)-rac.-α-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-β-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol;[R-(R*,S*)]-α-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-β-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol;[S-(R*,S*)]-α-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-β-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol;
and(R*,R*)-rac-α-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-β-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidinepropanol.In accordance with the present invention the compound of formula I
and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared by a process
which comprises
a) reducing a compound of the formula

wherein Z is -CH2C6H5, 
with hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as palladium on
carbon, or with a complex alkali metal hydride, such as lithium
aluminium or potassium borohydride, orb)
