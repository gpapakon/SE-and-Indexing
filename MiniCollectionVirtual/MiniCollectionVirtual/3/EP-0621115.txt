<ABSTRACT>
In this process, the wood is treated with a composition which comprises   (A) salt of organic or inorganic acid and organopolysiloxane containing radicals with basic nitrogen, bonded to SiC, in amounts of at least 0.5 per cent by weight of basic nitrogen, based on the weight of this organopolysiloxane, (B) a water-repellent active substance which is not solid at 20@C and 1020 hPa, with the proviso that the water-repellent active substance may also be an organosilicon compound which is solid at 20@C and 1020 hPa and which has a solubility under these conditions of over 50 parts by weight in 100 parts by weight of (A), if appropriate in a mixture with organosilicon compound with basic nitrogen in amounts of 0 to 0.5% by weight, based on the weight of this organosilicon compound, and/or silicic esters, and (C) water. po
