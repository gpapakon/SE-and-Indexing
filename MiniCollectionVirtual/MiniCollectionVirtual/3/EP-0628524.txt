<ABSTRACT>
The initial permeability of a manganese-zinc ferrite in the high-frequency zone of 10-500 Khz is improved by 
mixing a manganese-zinc ferrite comprising 50-56 mole % of Fe₂O₃, 22-39 mole % of Mno and 8-25 mole % of Zno 

with at most 800 ppm (in terms of Bi₂O₃) of bismuth oxide component and at most 1,200 ppm (in terms of MoO₃) of 
molybdenum oxide component and firing the mixture. The mean crystal grain diameter is adjusted to 5-50 µm or less.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to manganese-zinc system ferrite.Among manganese-zinc system ferrites, high magnetic
permeability ferrites comprising 50 to 56 mol% of Fe2O3, 22 to
39 mol% of MnO, and 8 to 25 mol% of ZnO, for example, have been
widely used as magnetic cores for high-frequency band
transformers and magnetic cores for line filters and noise
filters of various communication equipment or the like. These
high magnetic permeability ferrites are now required to have
high magnetic permeability particularly in the wide-frequency
range of about 100 kHz to about 500 kHz.Manganese-zinc system polycrystalline ferrites have the
general tendency that initial magnetic permeability µi
increases with a crystal grain size. One exemplary substance
known to promote grain growth is Bi2O3, which is practically
used in Japanese Patent Publication (JP-B) No. 29439/1977 to
establish a mean grain size of 50 µm or greater for improving
µi. However, a greater grain size concurrently entails 
increased losses, especially at high frequencies, due to which
only lower frequencies are available.Then JP-B No. 49079/1976 attempted to improve high-frequency
response by adding Bi2O3 and CaO in admixture. This
improvement, however, is effective only at frequencies of up to
about 100 kHz, and this material is not practically acceptable
as the high magnetic permeability material for line filters or
the like which is required to have high µi at higher
frequencies, for example, over the entire range of from 10 to
500 kHz.An object of the present invention is to provide a
manganese-zinc system ferrite having high magnetic permeability
in the high-frequency range, that is, high magnetic
permeability over the entire range of from 10 to 500 kHz.This and other objects are achieved by the present
invention which is defined below as (1) to (7).
