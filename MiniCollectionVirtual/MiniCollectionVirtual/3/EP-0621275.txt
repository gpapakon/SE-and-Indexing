<ABSTRACT>
A process for manufacturing monochloroacetaldehyde 
trimer and chloral together by effectively utilizing a 

raw material acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde. The process 
comprises a step of chlorinating acetaldehyde or paraaldehyde 

to produce a chlorinated liquid of which the 

major component is monochloroacetaldehyde, a step 
comprising adding chloral to said chlorinated liquid and 

distilling the mixture to obtain a fraction of which the 
major components are monochloroacetaldehyde and chloral, 

a step of trimerizing monochloroacetaldehyde by reacting 
said fraction in the presence of a trimerization 

catalyst and separating the MCA trimer by filtration, and 
a step of chlorinating other fractions from said 

distillation step and the filtrate from said 
trimerization step to produce chloral. According to this 

process all raw material aldehydes and components derived 
from aldehydes which have not been consumed for the 

production of MCA trimer can be easily converted into 
chloral which is useful as an industrial chemical. The 

process is also free from the problem of the waste water 
treatment.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
manufacturing monochloroacetaldehyde trimer together with 
chloral. Monochloroacetaldehyde (hereinafter abbreviated as 
MCA) is a compound useful as a raw material for the 
synthesis of organic compounds such as drugs and 
agricultural chemicals. Because this compound is 
extremely unstable and polymerizes very easily, it has 
been difficult to store it as is for a long period of 
time. Because of this, MCA is stored as an about 40% 
aqueous solution. It has been found that MCA can be 
stored stably, if trimerized into a trimer and stored as 
the trimer, and the trimer can be regenerated into high 
purity MCA. A process for the manufacture of MCA trimer 
has been proposed by Japanese Patent Laid-open (kokai) 
No. 223575/1990. This process comprises chlorinating 
acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde to a degree at which MCA 
can be obtained at a highest concentration, removing low-boiling 
point components by bubbling an inert gas such as 
nitrogen gas, dissolving the chlorinated liquid  
 
containing MCA as a major component, and trimerizing the 
MCA in the presence of high concentrated sulfuric acid. In this process the chlorination of the raw material 
acetaldehyde or para-aldehyde is carried out under the 
conditions which can bring about the highest MCA 
concentration, while suppressing production of 
dichloroacetaldehyde (hereinafter abbreviated as DCA). 
However, the amount of acetaldehyde unreacted is 
increased when reacted under such conditions. Separation 
of this unreacted acetaldehyde by distillation 
accompanies production of high-boiling point components 
due to condensation reactions among aldehyde molecules, 
making it difficult to reclaim acetaldehyde which has not 
been chlorinated. The yield of MCA by distillation is 
also reduced. Furthermore, this process has another 
problem in that it requires washing the solution 
containing MCA trimer with water in order to remove 
concentrated sulfuric acid which is used as a catalyst 
for trimerizing MCA after removal of non-chlorinated 
acetaldehyde. When the solution containing MCA trimer is 
washed with water, non-trimerized aldehydes, which are 
abundantly soluble in water, are transferred to the water 
phase. It is almost impossible to reclaim the aldehydes 
transferred to the water phase. The utilization of raw 
material acetaldehyde and para-aldehyde in this process 
is thus extremely low.  In view of this situation, the present inventors 
have undertaken further studies in order to more 
effectiv
