<DESCRIPTION>
 HERBICIDESThis invention relates to chemical compounds useful as herbicides, to processes for preparing them and to herbicidal compositions and processes utilising them.A number of derivatives of monic acid are known to have utility as biologically active compounds for use in human and veterinary medicine. Such compounds are described inter alia in GB 1587058.We have now found that certain monic acid derivatives, including esters, amides and salts have a novel and unexpected herbicidal activity.According to the present invention there is provided a herbicidal composition comprising a compound of the formula (I) or (IA) or (IB) in admixture with a herbicidally acceptable carrier or diluent, wherein Y2 3 represents (IC) or (ID) or (IE) and wherein R is a group CO-XR wherein X3 is 0 or S and R is hydrogen or an agrochemically acceptable ester-forming radical; or R is a group -R wherein R is an optionally substituted aryl or heterocyclic group; or R is a group CO-NR R wherein R and R are the same or different and each represent an agrochemically acceptable amide-forming radical; stereoisomers of the compounds of formula (I), (IA)2 and (IB) and salts of the compound of formula (I), (IA) and (IB) wherein R3 3 is COXR , X is 0 and is hydrogen.According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of severely damaging or killing unwanted plants, which comprises applying to the plants, or to the growth medium of the plants, a herbicidally effective amount of a compound of the formula (I) or (IA) wherein Y represents (IC) or (ID) or (IE);2 3 3R is a group CO-XR wherein X is 0 or S and R rs hydrogen or an agrochemically acceptable ester-forming radical; or2R is a group -R wherein R is an optionally substituted heterocyclic2 group; or R is a group -CO-NH-CI- -CO-W wherein W is hydrogen, optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted C- to C20 alkyl, optionally substituted C2 to C„ alkenyl, optionally substituted C2 to Cg alkynyl, optionally substituted heterocyclyl or C- to C7 cycloalkyl; or2 R is a group -CO-NH-NH- or -C0-NH-NH-C0-Y wherein Y is optionally substituted C. to C2Q alkyl, optionally substituted C2 to C„ alkenyl, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted aralkyl or optionally substituted heterocyclyl; or2 5' 6' 5' 6'R is a group CO-NR R wherein R and R are the same or different and
