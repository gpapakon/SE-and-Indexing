<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a device for presealing a document onto a plastic web (sheet). It comprises at least one first roller (3) around which the document rolls from a first given point (T1) in the space, this point being tangent to the roller (3), and means (4) for heating the plastic web (2) at a second point (T2), tangent to the roller, where the plastic web (2) is in contact with the document, this tangent point (T2) making a constant angle ( alpha ) with the given point (T1) in the space, the document being presealed by the heating of the plastic web at this second tangent point (T2). Application: Presealing, onto a plastic web, of documents intended to be laminated industrially.

<CLAIMS>
Device for presealing a document onto a web of
plastic (2), characterized in that it comprises at least:


a first roll (3) around which the document runs
from a first given point (T1) in the space tangent to the

roll (3);
means (4) for fixing the web of plastic (2) at
a second point (T2) tangent to the roll where the web of

plastic (2) is in contact with the document, this tangent
point (T2) making a constant angle (α) with the given

point (T1) in the space, the document being presealed by
fixing it to the web of plastic at this second tangent

point (T2).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the fixing means (4) are means for heating the web

of plastic (2), the document being presealed by heating
the web of plastic in the region of the second tangent

point (T2).
Device according to Claim 2, characterized in
that the heating means consist of at least one metal

heating element (4) which is fixed to a second roll (7)
and heats the web of plastic (2) as it passes through the

region of the second tangent point (T2), the angular
position of the second roll (7) being defined beforehand

and the angular speeds of the first (3) and second (7)
rolls being dependent on each other.
Device according to Claim 3, characterized in
that, with the first (3) and second (7) rolls rotating at

the same speed, the second roll (7) has as many metal
heating elements as there are documents to be presealed 

per revolution and per row of the first roll (3).
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, the document being printed

on a sheet and the sheet running around the first roll

(3) from the first tangent point (T1), a cutting roll (9)
cuts the document by pressing on the first roll (3), the

cutting roll (9) having a cutting line (10, 11, 12) which
is then pressed against the sheet.
Device according to Claim 5, characterized in
that the centre (CD) of the second roll (9) makes a

constant angle (β) with the first tangent point (T1).
Device according to either of Claims 5 and 6,
characterized in that the angular speed of the cutting

roll (9) is approximately a multiple of the angular speed
of the first roll (3).
Device according to any one of Claims 5 to 7,
characterized in that it includes means for extracting

the skeleton of the sheet, the extraction means
consisting of a set of extraction rollers (41, 42, 43)

and of series of belts (44, 45, 46), at least one first
series of belts (44), which are housed in the first roll

and driven by a first extraction roller (41), removing
the skeleton from the first roll (3) and a second series

of belts (45), which are driven by the cutting roll, and
a second extraction roller (42) holding the cut document

against the first roll (3).
Device according to Claim 8, characterized in
that the extraction means furthermore include a third

extraction roller (43) and a third series of belts (46)
in order to remove the skeleton from the first series of

belts (44), the belts of the third series (46) being
driven by the second (41) and third (43) extraction

rollers.
Device according to any one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that it is coupled to means (53,

54) for coating documents with plastic and with means
(58, 59) for cutting the plastic-coated documents, the

plastic-coating means heating the web (2) onto which the
documents are presealed.
