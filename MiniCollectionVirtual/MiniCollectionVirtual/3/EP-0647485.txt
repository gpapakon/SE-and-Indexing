<CLAIMS>
An apparatus for alternately coiling and uncoiling 
strip material (B), in particular continuously-cast 

thin slabs in pairs of furnaces (5, 6), consisting of 
two furnaces (9, 10, 11, 12) arranged one above the 

other with horizontal coiler shafts (17, 18), the 
furnaces (9-12) being pivotable from a coiling position 

into an uncoiling position and the coiling and 
uncoiling taking place at different speeds,
 
characterised in that each furnace (9 to 12) of the 

pair of furnaces (5, 6) is pivotable about its vertical 
axis (15) independently of the other furnace. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1, characterised 
in that both furnaces (9, 10, or 11, 12) are pivotable 

about their common axis. 
An apparatus according to Claim 1 at 2, 
characterised in that the axis about which the furnaces 

(9, 10 or 11, 12) are pivotable intersects the coiling 
axis centrally. 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that a horizontal passage for strip 

material which is not to be coiled is provided between 
the furnaces (9, 10 or 11, 12). 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 4, 
characterised in that each furnace (9 to 12) is 

pivotable by 90 degrees between the coiling position 
and uncoiling position. 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 5, 
characterised in that a pair of furnaces (5, 6) is 

arranged in each case after each strand of a multi-strand  
 

thin-slab casting plant (1, 2) and before a 
common finishing train (7), between which pair of 

furnaces and between the furnaces (9, 10 or 11, 12) of 
the pair of furnaces facing the finishing train (7) 

there are provided horizontal driving roller tables (8) 
for the strip material. 
An apparatus according to Claim 6, characterised 
in that the driving roller tables (8) are at least 

partly enclosed in heat-insulating manner. 
An apparatus according to one of Claims 1 to 6, 
characterised in that each furnace (9 to 12) of a pair 

of furnaces (5, 6) is arranged in a supporting frame 
(13) which is rotationally mounted on a turntable (14) 

with a central axis (15) corresponding to the pivot 
axis of the furnaces.
