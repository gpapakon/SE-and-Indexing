<CLAIMS>
A four-column roll stand having four screwdown cylinders (1, 
2, 3, 4) which are disposed in opposite pairs laterally of the 

rolled strip (6) and which each have a position measuring 
transmitter (7) for measuring their lift position (LA1, LA2, LB3, 

LB4) and are each equipped with a measured value transmitter (8) 
for determining the reaction force adsorbed by the screwdown 

cylinders (1, 2, 3, 4), said stand having a control system (10) 
for positioning the upper part (5) of the stand which, in 

dependence on the measured value of the position measuring 
transmitter (7), delivers a control signal (SA1, SA2, SB3, SB4) 

for lifting, lowering or pivoting the upper part (5) of the 
stand, allowing for a differential length value (dLA, dLB) 

determined from the difference of the lift position, 
characterized in that 


the measured value transmitters (8) for detecting the reaction 
force absorbed by the screwdown cylinders (1, 2, 3, 4) are 

connected to the control system (10), and 
the control system (10) determines a differential reaction 
force value (dFA, dFB) from which, after multiplication by an 

amplification factor (f), a differential length value (CA, CB) 
of the pairs of screwdown cylinders (A, B) is calculated, from  

 
which the control system (10) determines the control signal 

(SA1, SA2, SB3, SB4) for at least one of said screwdown cylinders 
(1, 2, 3, 4). 
A roll stand according to claim 1, characterized in that the 
control system (10) has numerical stores in which the 

differential length values (CA, CB) determined for an adjusting 
operation can be so stored that they can be called up for the 

determination of the correctional values of the following 
adjusting operation. 
A roll stand according to claim 2, characterized in that the 
control system (10) has a regulator circuit (12) by means of 

which the differential length values (CA
n
, CB
n
) can be 
iteratively determined, starting with an initial value. 
A roll stand according to one of claims 1 to 3, characterized 
in that the control system (10) has numerical stores in which the 

differential length values (CA, CB) determined for each adjusting 
operation can be added up, the control system (10) delivering a 

warning signal when a limit value of the total is exceeded. 
A roll stand according to one of claims 1 to 4, characterized 
in that when a limit value of the differential reaction forces 

(dFA, dFB) absorbed by the screwdown cylinders (1, 2, 3, 4) of a 
pair of screwdown cylinders (A, B) is exceeded, the control 

system (10) delivers a warning signal.  
 
A roll stand according to one of the preceding claims, 
characterized in that when a total formed by the addition of the 

differential reaction forces (dFA, dFB) determined for each pair 
of screwdown cylinders (A, B) is exceeded, the control system 

(10) delivers a warning signal.
