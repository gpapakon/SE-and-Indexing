A process of producing pure water, wherein raw water or 
similar feed water is supplied to a conditioning device 

(1) with at least one semipermeable membrane (4), part 
of the raw water going through the membrane (4) as pure 

water under the driving force of a pressure difference, 
and the remaining raw water that flows by the membrane 

(4) leaving the conditioning device (1) as a 
concentrate, wherein an increase in the static water 

pressure on the pure water side (6) of the membrane (4) 
is brought about by means of an intermittent reduction 

or interruption of the outflow of pure water at the 
membrane (4) and after a static pressure increase on 

the pure water side (6), particularly after a balancing 
of the static water pressure on both sides of the 

membrane (4), the static water pressure prevailing on 
the raw water side (5) of the conditioning device (1) 

is periodically lowered momentarily, preferably 
abruptly, relative to the static water pressure 

prevailing on the pure water side (6), 
characterized in 
that
 the raw water or feed water is supplied to a 
semipermeable membrane (4) in the form of a wound 

module, that the outflow of raw water and the outflow 
of pure water at the membrane (4) is periodically 

reduced or interrupted for a short time, and that 
before the outflow of pure water is opened or increased 

the outflow of raw water at the membrane (4) is opened 
or increased in a reversed direction of flow compared 

to the direction of flow of the raw water flowing by  
 

the membrane (4) prior to the reduction or 
interruption. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that 
the time intervals provided for reversing the direction 

of flow and/or for altering the water pressure at the 
membrane (4) are selected in dependence on the degree 

of pollution of the raw water or feed water. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or claim 2, 
characterized in that pure water or a less saliferous 

water compared to the formerly used raw water is 
temporarily supplied as feed water to the conditioning 

device (1), preferably for intermittent passage in a 
reverse direction of flow, particularly during a short-term 

lowering of the static water pressure on the raw 
water side (5) compared to the static water pressure 

prevailing on the pure water side (6). 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterized in that chemical precoating agents, 

adsorbing agents and/or absorbing agents are supplied 
before the membrane (4) in the direction of flow. 
A process as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that the process for producing pure 

water is a reverse osmosis process, particularly a 
process for purifying waste water. 
A conditioning device for producing pure water, 
particularly for carrying out the process as claimed in 

any one of claims 1 to 5, including at least one 
semipermeable membrane (4) separating a raw water zone 

or feed water zone (5) of the conditioning device (1) 
from a pure water zone (6) in such a way that part of  

 
the raw water or feed water flowing by the membrane (4) 

goes through the membrane (4) as pure water under the 
driving force of a pressure difference, wherein the 

conditioning device (1) has at least two openings (10, 
11) leading to the raw or supply water zone (5), one of 

which openings serves as a water inlet for supplying 
the raw or feed water to the membrane (4) and the other 

is designed as a water outlet for the concentrate, 
whereby the conditioning device (1) has at least one 

pure water outlet (13) in its pure water zone (6), and 
whereby stop valves (14, 15) or similar shutting-off or 

control elements are provided for the alternate 
pressure adjustment and change of the water pressure 

prevailing in the raw water zone and in the pure water 
zone (5, 6) of the conditioning device (1), 


characterized in that
 the semipermeable membrane (4) of 
the conditioning device (1) takes the form of a wound 

module, that the direction of flow of the water flowing 
by the membrane (4) on the raw water or feed water side 

(5) is reversible by means of a flow reversal means, 
that the openings (10, 11) leading to the raw water or 

feed water zone (5) of the conditioning device (1) are 
provided as water inlet or water outlet alternately and 

periodically and that the pure water outlet (13) and 
the openings (10, 11) leading to the raw water zone (5) 

are in each case regulable by means of a shutting-off 
or control element. 
A conditioning device as claimed in claim 6, 
characterized in that the stop valves (14, 15) take the 

form of ball valves or similar quick-action valves. 
A conditioning device as claimed in claim 6 or claim 7, 
characterized in that at least one front face of the  

 
wound module prefe
rably serves as a precoat filter 
and/or prefilter. 
A conditioning device as claimed in any one of claims 6 
to 8, characterized in that the conditioning device (1) 

has a housing (2) to accommodate a wound module (3), 
the housing interior thereof being connected to the raw 

water line or feed water line on the inflow and outflow 
side, and that provided in the annular gap (7) formed 

between the wound module (3) and the housing (2) there 
is a ring seal (8) which is preferably arranged at an 

end zone of the wound module (3) and seals the annular 
gap (7) only in one direction of flow (Pf1) and is 

permeable in the opposite direction of flow (Pf2).
