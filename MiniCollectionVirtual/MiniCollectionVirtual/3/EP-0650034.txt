<ABSTRACT>
Fitted to one side of the flow channel are two ultrasonic transducers which operate alternately in the transmitting/receiving mode. On the side, lying opposite the ultrasonic transducers, of the flow channel, there are arranged two hollow mirror-shaped reflectors. The reflectors effect a guidance of the ultrasonic signal, in which the sensitivity distribution is averaged out and hence the flow measurement becomes independent of the prevailing flow profile.

<CLAIMS>
Device for measuring flow in a flow channel
(SK) having a first ultrasound transducer (USW1) and a

second ultrasound transducer (USW2), which are arranged
parallel to the wall of the flow channel, a reflector

respectively facing each ultrasound transducer (USW1,
USW2) in the flow channel (SK), and a signal that can

be input by one ultrasound transducer respectively
impinging on the other ultrasound transducer,

characterized in that

a focal point (BP1) of a first reflector (R1),
which faces the first ultrasound transducer (USW1)

and is of the concave mirror type, lies on the
transducer face of the first ultrasound transducer

(USW1),
and a focal point (BP2) of a second reflector
(R2), which faces the second ultrasound transducer

(USW2) and is of the concave mirror type, lies on
the transducer face of the second ultrasound

transducer (USW2).
Device according to Claim 1, characterized in
that the first reflector (R1) of the concave mirror

type has the form of a paraboloid of rotation.
Device according to Claim 1 or 2, characterized
in that the second reflector (R2) of the concave mirror

type has the form of a paraboloid of rotation.
Device according to one of the preceding
claims, characterized in that, on the opposite side 

from the ultrasound transducers (USW1, USW2), the flow
channel (SK) has a trough-shaped recess in which the

reflectors (R1, R2) are arranged.
