<ABSTRACT>
In a high pressure fuel pumping apparatus 3, a drain
passage 12 for fuel having leaked from the inside of a fuel sealing

metallic bellows 26, and another drain passage 13 for a high
pressure fuel regulator 8 for regulating the pressure discharged

from the high pressure fuel pumping apparatus are merged at a
merging point. A lead type of check valve 17 is located upstream

in the drain passage 12 between the merging point 14 and the fuel
sealing metallic bellows 26, and a ball type of check valve 18

is located downstream in the drain passage 12.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an improvement of a high
pressure fuel pumping apparatus, and more particularly to a high
pressure pumping apparatus used for an in-cylinder jet gasoline
engine.Referring to Fig. 6, an explanation will be given of a
related high pressure fuel pumping apparatus.In Fig. 6, reference numeral 1 denotes a fuel jet valve
for directly jetting fuel into each of cylinders of an engine (not
shown). Reference numeral 2 denotes a delivery pipe for supplying
fuel to the fuel jet valve. Reference numeral 3 denotes a high
pressure fuel pumping apparatus for supplying the high pressure
fuel into the delivery pipe 2 through a high pressure fuel supply
passage 4. Reference numeral 5 denotes a high pressure fuel pump
of a piston type. Reference numeral 6 denotes an inhalation valve
for the high pressure fuel pump, which is constructed from a lead
valve. Reference numeral 7 denotes a discharge valve for the high
pressure fuel pump, which is constructed from a lead valve.
Reference numeral 8 denotes a high pressure fuel regulator for
regulating the fuel pressure of fuel discharged from the high
pressure fuel pump 5 at a prescribed value. Reference numeral 
9 denotes a high pressure damper mounted between the high pressure
fuel regulator 8 and the high pressure fuel pump 5. Reference
numeral 10 denotes a low pressure fuel passage which is connected
to a low pressure fuel pump (not shown). Reference numeral 11
denotes a low pressure damper. Reference numeral 12 denotes a
drain passage for returning the fuel having leaked from a gap
between the sleeve and piston of the high pressure fuel pump 5
toward a fuel tank. Reference numeral 13 denotes a drain passage
for the high pressure fuel regulator 8. Reference numeral 14
denotes a merging point of the drain passages 12 and 13. Reference
numeral 15 denotes a returning passage which is communicated with
the fuel tank (not shown). Reference numeral 16 denotes a check
valve which is arranged on the drain passage 12 for the high
pressure fuel pump 5, which is constructed from a ball valve.In the related pumping apparatus having a structure
described above, the check valve 16 is arranged in the drain
passage 12 for the high pressure fuel pump 5, and the amount of
the fuel which has leaked from a gap between the sleeve and piston
of the high pressure fuel pump 5 stands within a high pressure
fuel drain chamber, thereby preventing the pressure of the drain
chamber from being boosted and a fuel sealing metallic bellows
from being broken.The check valve 16
