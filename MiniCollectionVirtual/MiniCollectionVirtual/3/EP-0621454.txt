<ABSTRACT>
A gas-lance apparatus and method for injecting a rate-enhancing gas between a 
flame and a thermal load to augment combustion of fuel undergoing combustion 

in the flame. A fan-shaped main jet is introduced between the flame for 
producing a low pressure field of the rate-enhancing gas between the flame and 

the thermal load. The low pressure field deforms the flame into the shape of the 
main jet and draws the flame toward the thermal load. The main jet decays 

along its length due to entrainment of combustion-environment gas in the main 
jet. In order to delay such decay, a fan-shaped booster jet of rate-enhancing 

gas is introduced between the main jet and the thermal load. The booster jet 
has a higher velocity than the main jet and is positioned adjacent to the main 

jet.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a gas-lance apparatus and method for injecting 
a rate-enhancing gas between a flame and a thermal load to augment 
combustion of the fuel undergoing combustion in the flame. More particularly, 
the present invention relates to such a gas-lance apparatus and method in which 
fan-shaped main and booster jets of the rate-enhancing gas are introduced 
between the flame and the thermal load to deform the flame into the shape of 
the main jet and to draw the flame in the direction of the thermal load. Many industrial processes involve burning a fuel to heat a thermal load such as 
a melt composed of, for instance, metals, ferric and non-ferric, glass, and etc. 
In order to increase the heat transfer to the thermal load, it is also known to 
inject a rate-enhancing gas, such as oxygen or oxygen-enriched air into the fuel. 
Burners that employ a rate-enhancing gas in the combustion of a fuel are known 
in the art as oxy-fuel burners. The problem with oxy-fuel burners is that the heat transfer tends to be relatively 
concentrated, and as a result, hot spots tend to develop in the melt. In order to 
prevent this, gas-lancing method and apparatus have been provided in the prior 
art. A prior art gas-lancing method and apparatus is illustrated in U.S. Patent 
Number 4,927,357. In such gas-lancing method and apparatus, rate-enhancing 
gas is injected between a burner or a fuel nozzle and a melt by way of an 
oxidant nozzle which imparts a fan-shaped configuration to the rate-enhancing 
gas jet. This fan-shaped rate-enhancing gas jet produces a low pressure field 
which tends to attract the flame towards the melt while deforming the flame 
toward the shape of the fan-shaped rate-enhancing gas jet. This produces 
burning over a wide area with more homogeneous heat transfer which avoids 
any hot spots developing in the melt. A problem with prior art gas-lancing is that the jet of rate-enhancing gas tends 
to decay over its length due to entrainment of combustion-environment gas. As 
a result, the degree to which the flame emanating from the fuel jet or burner can 
be influenced is somewhat limited. The present invention provides a method and apparatus by which the degree to  
 
which the flame can be influenced by the low pressure field of rate-enhancing 
gas  
 
can be increased over that possible in the prior art. In one aspect, the present 
invention provides a lance for injecting a rate-enhancing gas between a flame and a 
thermal load such as a melt to augment combustion of fuel
