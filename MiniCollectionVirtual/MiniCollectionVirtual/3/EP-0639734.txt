<ABSTRACT>
A piston and connecting rod assembly (10) 
has a floating piston pin (14) that is retained in 

centred assembly by a retainer clip (15) having hooked 
fingers (43) that lock into grooves (30) in one end 

(20) of a pin bore (22) and hooked stringers (35) that 
lock the piston pin (14) in position in the assembly 

(10) after installation. The clip (15) is formed of 
any suitable resilient material such as glass-filled 

thermoplastics material.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to wrist pin or
piston pin joints and more particularly to piston and
rod connections joined by a piston pin and including
means for retaining the piston pin in the assembly, as
specified in the preamble of independent claim 1 or independent claim 2. The terms wrist
pin and piston pin are used interchangeably in this
document as meaning the same thing.It is known in the art relating to engines,
compressors and the like to connect a reciprocable
piston with the small end of a connecting rod by a
wrist pin. The wrist pin may be pressed or otherwise
retained in a transverse bore of either the piston or
the rod or it may be of the "full-floating" type. In
the latter case some form of retainer is used to
prevent the pin from sliding out of the bore and
scoring the wall of the associated cylinder. In
current automotive engine practice where floating pins
are used, it is common to provide annular spring clips
snapped into grooves on either end of the piston bore
to retain the piston pin in the piston-connecting rod
assembly (US-A-5 111 737).A piston and connecting rod assembly
according to the present invention is characterised by
the features specified in the characterising portion
of independent claim 1 or independent claim 2.The present invention provides an improved
piston pin retainer in the form of a resilient and
preferably non-metallic clip that is retained in added
grooves of the piston adjacent the piston pin bore and
then retains the piston pin upon its installation in
the aligned bores of the piston and connecting rod.These and other features of the invention
will be more fully understood from the following 
description taken together with the accompanying
drawings, in which:
Figure 1 is a partially-exploded pictorial
view of a piston-connecting rod assembly having a
piston pin joint and retaining means according to the
present invention; andFigure 2 is a cross-sectional view taken on
the line 2-2, showing the assembled piston pin joint
of Figure 1.Referring now to the drawings in detail,
numeral 10 generally indicates a piston and connecting
rod assembly including a piston 11 and a connecting
rod 12 connected together by a wrist pin, ie, a piston
pin 14 retained in the assembly by a retainer clip 15.The piston 11 is of generally conventional
automotive construction and includes a head, crown
portion 16 including a surrounding ring belt 18. A
skirt 19 extends below the ring belt (the piston 11
being shown inverted in Figure 1) and includes opposed
flats 20 which define
