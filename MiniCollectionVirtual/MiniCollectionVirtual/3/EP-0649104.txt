<ABSTRACT>
Apparatus for analysis and filtering of complex waveforms 
using a method of waveform generation which creates a sequence 

of output values, each comprising the calculated result of a 
generator equation. In one embodiment, said output values, 

which represent a test waveform are subtracted from a complex 
waveform to yield a filtered, modified waveform for further 

inspection on an oscilloscope (1) for example.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to apparatus and methods for 
analysis, filtering and demodulation of analogue waveforms. The invention has particular application to analysis of 
complex waveforms and especially in cases where a waveform of 
interest carries unwanted distortion components. The 
invention can provide a means for removing any unwanted 
distortion so that the desired waveform may be recovered, i.e. 
certain waveform components can be filtered out. The invention's embodiments exploit a method of waveform 
generation which creates a sequence of output values, each 
comprising the calculated result of a generator equation. 
This method and apparatus therefor are described in detail in 
our co-pending European Patent Application EP-A-509,713. Certain generator equations, an example of which could be 
the inverse of a trigonometric function eg arc.cos(Sin P) are 
referred to in the aforesaid co-pending Application as 
"Portmanteau functions". Herein a Portmanteau Function can be 
any generator equation. This invention therefore comprises apparatus for 
processing an analogue waveform having an unwanted component 
and in which said apparatus includes;
 
   means for converting said analogue waveform into digital 
form to give a first set of digital values:
 
   calculator means for receiving a sequence of input values 
which form the argument of a generator equation and to create 
a second set of digital values each comprising the calculated 
result of the generator equation;
 
 
   and means for combining the second set of digital values 
with the first set of digital values to produce a modified set 
of digital values representing a modified version of said 
analogue waveform and thereby removing said unwanted 
component. The second set of digital values represent the unwanted 
component of the analogue waveform. If the unwanted component is a noise signal for example, 
then the second set of values can be subtracted from the first 
(or added if the signal is inverted) to leave the modified, 
wanted signal. If the unwanted component is a modulation signal, then 
the second set of values can be multiplied with or divided 
into the first set as appropriate in order to remove the 
modulation component and restore the original waveform. Preferably, analysing means are employed for determining 
characteristic parameters of said waveform. The analysing 
means could comprise an oscilloscope so that the waveform 
characteristics can be determined by visual inspection. 
Alternatively a computer could be
