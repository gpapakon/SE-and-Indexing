A method of producing 1,2,3,4,10, 14b-hexahydro-2-methyl-dibenzo[c,f]pyrazino[1,2-a]

azepine of formula (I)


and physiologically acceptable salts thereof, starting from styrene oxide, characterised in that

(a) styrene oxide of formula (II)


is reacted with N-benzylaminoethanol of formula (III)


at a reaction temperature of 80 to 160Â°C to form the compound of formula (IV)

(b) the compound of formula (IV) which is obtained is converted, in an inert aprotic solvent
with a chlorinating agent, into the compound of formula (V)



and the resulting compound of formula (V) is condensed with 2-aminobenzyl alcohol of
formula (VI)



without isolating the compound of formula (V), to form the compound of formula (VII)


wherein the molar ratio of the 2-aminobenzyl alcohol of formula (VI) to the compound
of formula (V) is 0.8:1 to 1.2:1, wherein the condensation, which occurs with

cyclisation, is effected in a two-phase system, wherein a corresponding equivalent base
is added to the reaction mixture for binding the acid formed during the reaction, and

wherein isolation of the compound of formula (VII) is effected by the crystallisation of a
suitable salt, 
(c) the compound of formula (VII) which is obtained is cyclised, by means of a strong acid
which is used in a large molar excess, to form the compound of formula (VIII)



after which the salt of the compound of formula (VIII) which is first formed is reacted
with a suitable base to form the free base of compound (VIII),
(d) in the compound of formula (VIII) which is obtained, the benzyl group is removed in an
aprotic solvent by reaction with a molar excess of an ester of chloroformic acid of

formula (IX)


wherein R represents a C
1
-C
6
 alkyl group or a phenyl or benzyl group, and the
compound of formula (X)


 
which is formed as an intermediate is saponified with a base to form the compound of

formula (XI)

(e) the resulting compound of formula (XI) is methylated, under reducing conditions with
formaldehyde, by catalytic reductive amination with hydrogen to form 1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydro-2-methyl-dibenzo[c,f]
pyrazino[1,2-a]azepine

of formula (I), and
(f) the base obtained in step (e) is optionally converted, in a manner which is known in the
art, into a physiologically acceptable salt thereof.
A method according to claim 1, characterised in that in step (f) the base is converted
into the hydrochloride.
