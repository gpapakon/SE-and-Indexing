locally applied to a recording medium (11,411,811) in accordance 

with information to be recorded and a physical quantity 
such as a current, voltage and the like of a portion

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to an information
recording method and an information recording
apparatus. Note that the information recording
apparatus of the present invention includes one having
a reproduction function.As a recording method for recording bit
information, a magnetic recording method using a
magnetic tape, a magnetic disk, or the like, an
electrical recording method using a semiconductor
element, and the like are known. In recent years,
requirements for a large capacity, a high-speed
operation, and a decrease in error rate have become
strong with an increase in amount of information to be
recorded.In such a situation, an element which has a
metal-organic insulating film-metal structure in which
an organic thin film (e.g., a thin film of a
π-electron-based organic compound, a chalcogenide, or
the like) is sandwiched between metal electrodes, and
has a memory effect with respect to the switching
characteristics of a voltage current (to be referred to 
as an "MIM" element hereinafter) was developed
(Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 63-096956).
In such an MIM element, when a proper pulse voltage is
applied across the metal electrodes, the conductivity
of the element can be reversibly changed. Therefore,
by utilizing this switching phenomenon, information can
be recorded in the MIM element. In addition, in this
switching phenomenon, the switching speed is very high.Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram showing a
conventional recording apparatus utilizing the MIM
element.A recording apparatus 2010 includes a recording
medium 2011, a current amplifier 2012, and a recording
voltage generating circuit 2013. The recording medium
2011 includes a lower electrode 20111, an upper
electrode 20112, and a recording layer 20113 which is
arranged between the upper and lower electrodes 20112
and 20111, and consists of an LB film having different
conductivities ρ between a non-recording state and a
recording state. More specifically, the recording
medium 2011 has the element structure of the
above-mentioned MIM element. The recording voltage
generating circuit 2013 generates a recording voltage
(recording pulse voltage), and applies the generated
recording voltage across the lower and upper electrodes
20111 and 20112, thereby applying the recording voltage
to the recording layer 20113. The current amplifier 
2012 detects and amplifies a current flowing between
the lower and upper electrodes 20111 and 20112 during
application of the recording voltage.The operation of the recording apparatus 2010 will
be
