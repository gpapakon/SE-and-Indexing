<ABSTRACT>
An apparatus for pasting a battery collector 
assembly having a current collector and enlarged members 

having a top surface-and a bottom surface and a thickness 
greater than the current collector is provided. The 

current collector has at least one predetermined area 
into which paste is to be filled to a predetermined first 

level on one side of the current collector and a 
predetermined second level on the other side of the 

current collector to form a paste layer of predetermined 
thickness less than the thickness of the enlarged 

members. The apparatus comprises a reservoir for 
electrochemically active paste, a paste-dispensing nozzle 

having an orifice located in a dispensing end of the 
nozzle, and a feed conduit connecting the paste reservoir 

and dispensing nozzle and operable to supply paste to the 
dispensing nozzle. The nozzle is mounted to dispense 

paste in at least one more paste area of the collector 
assembly. A valve is provided which is operable to 

control the flow of paste from the nozzle such that paste 
is dispensed therefrom and flows into the paste area. 

The nozzle dispensing end is adapted to size the first 

level of paste dispensed in the paste area, and a surface 
is provided opposite the dispensing end of the nozzle 

which is adapted to size the second level of paste 
dispensed in the paste area. The clearance between the 

nozzle dispensing end and opposing sizing surface is 
adjusted such that paste is dispensed from the nozzle, 

flows into the paste area of the collector assembly, and 
is sized such that the first level is intermediate the 

top surface of the enlarged members and the current 
collector and the second level is intermediate the 

current collector and the bottom surface of the enlarged 
members. Thus, the enlarged portions of the collector 

assembly are left substantially free of paste.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to methods and apparatus for 
applying electrochemically active paste to current 
collectors for lead-acid electric storage batteries, and 
especially, to methods and apparatus for pasting current 
collectors useful in modular lead-acid storage batteries. Modular multicell batteries represent a total 
departure from traditional designs for SLI automotive 
lead-acid batteries. Traditional designs incorporate a 
premolded container divided into individual cell 
compartments. Battery plates and separators are 
separately formed and are inserted into the cell 
compartments during assembly of the battery. Modular battery designs, such as those disclosed in 
U.S. Pats. 4,239,839 and 4,209,579 to W. McDowall et al. 
and U.S. Pats. 4,022,951 and 3,941,615 to W. McDowall, 
however, do not have a premolded container. Instead, the 
container, such as it is, is formed by assembling the 
battery plates and separators themselves, a process which 
is made possible by the unique structure of the plate and 
separator assemblies used in modular batteries. Traditionally designed lead-acid, SLI batteries have 
plates consisting of a grid-like alloy current collector 
which is layered with electrochemically active paste to 
form a plate. The plates in modular batteries, however, 
are fabricated from collector assemblies. The collector 
assemblies have a lead alloy current collector, usually 
in the form of a mesh or sheet, which is molded into a 
thermoplastic frame. The thermoplastic frame has various 
dividers which define a number of areas into which 
positive and negative paste is applied. The separator  
 
assemblies are similar, having separator material molded 
into a thermoplastic frame of like construction. After the collector assemblies are pasted to form 
plates, the plates are stacked along with separator 
assemblies, and the perimeter members of the 
thermoplastic frames are welded together to create a 
leak-tight container. Likewise, dividers in adjacent 
frames are welded together at the same time to isolate 
adjacent positive and negative areas of the plates. The only method commercially utilized to paste 
modular battery collectors uses a pasting machine similar 
to that disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,307,758 to W. McDowall 
et al. which is designed to paste collector assemblies 
having a mesh current collector. That pasting machine 
incorporates a number of paste extrusion nozzles 
communicating with a paste reservoir. When the machine 
is being operated, flow of paste through the
