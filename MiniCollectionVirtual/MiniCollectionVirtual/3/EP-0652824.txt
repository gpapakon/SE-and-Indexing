<ABSTRACT>
A worm shaft (2) with attached kneaders (6) and intermediate kneaders (98) fitted in the casing rotates in a worm extruder (1). The kneaders (98) can rotate in the directions (105) and move radially in the directions (103, 104). At the outlet end of the worm extruder a counter-pressure member (9) can be axially moved by means of a piston rod (10) of a cylinder-piston unit (not shown), thus enabling the cross-section of exit apertures (8.3) to be altered. A rotating blade (4.3) cuts the product issuing from the exit aperture (8.3) into predetermined lengths. Supporting rings (22, 94) make it possible to support the worm in the worm casing at optional distances along the worm extruder. According to figs. 16, 16a, the rotary kneaders (98) can be moved together by means of a rack (107) driven by a piston-cylinder unit (111). To exchange the kneaders (98), the casing (3) is divided into an upper lifting half (106) and a lower fixed half (71.1), the two halves being linked by a hinge (84).

<CLAIMS>
Screw press (1) with a kneading and pressing screw
capable of being rotated and driven and arranged in

a housing, and a press head connected to said
screw, in which the feed material is pressed into a

specified shape,

with a counterpressure element and
a ring-shaped body (23), connected to the
housing (3), which at least partially

encompasses the counterpressure element (9) seen
in the axial direction,
whereby, in order to provide the cross-sectional
shaping of the product, the counterpressure

element (9) and/or the ring-shaped body (23, 49)
feature shaping channels (8, 45) of

predetermined form, and in which media are
provided to change the longitudinal shape of the

feed, and additional intermediate bodies (46)
are provided, which engage in the shaping

channels (8, 45) of the counterpressure element
(9) and in this situation, together with the

shaping channels (8, 45), form the cross-section
of the product, characterised in that, to change

this cross-section, the intermediate bodies (46)
are arranged under spring tension at the ring-shaped

bodies (23, 49), that the intermediate
bodies (46) are capable of being independently,

by means of additional media (50, 51, 54, 56,
57), radially inwards and, thanks to their

spring-loading property, moved outwards again,
in which situation replaceable kneading elements

(82) are provided for, arranged at the housing
(72, 73), which engage in the subdivisions (78)

of the screw windings (74), and the kneading
elements (82) are arranged in an adjustable

manner.
Screw press according to Claim 1, characterised in
that, in order to move radially about the

intermediate bodies (46), ramps are provided for on
the one hand at the intermediate bodies (46) and,

on the other, a ring (49) is provided for in the
axial direction of the kneading and pressing screw,

said ring being capable of being moved via these
ramps and being shaped in such a way that axial

movements of the ring (49) cause the intermediate
bodies (46) to move in the radial direction

inwards.
Screw press according to Claim 2, characterised in
that the movable ring is capable of displacement by

means of a motor.
Screw press according to Claim 1, characterised in
that media are provided at the outlet of the

shaping channels (45) in order to impose underpressure
on the shaping channels (45).
Screw press according to Claim 1, characterised in
that a blade (4) is provided which moves past at

the outlet of the shaping channels (45), whereby
the blade (4) is capable of being driven

independently of the speed of rotation of the
screw.
Screw press according to at least one of the
forgoing Claims 1 to 5, characterised in that the

kneading elements (82) present an asymmetric cross-section,
seen in the radial direction to the screw

press (1), that the housing (72, 73) is capable of
tilting upwards for the replacement of the kneading

elements (82), that the kneading elements (82) are
capable of being rotated and driven, and that the 

screw press (1) features at least one support ring
(77) which provides additional bearing support in a

rotatable manner for the screw shaft (79), at least
at the end of the shaft which is directed towards

the press ram.
