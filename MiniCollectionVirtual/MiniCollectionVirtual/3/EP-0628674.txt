<ABSTRACT>
A fiber-reinforced plastic rod is formed out of a core material and a surface material, the core material consisting of high-strength 
continuous fiber and a parent resin, the surface material consisting of polypropylene fiber. This fiber-reinforced plastic 

rod is not deteriorated even when mortar and concrete are autoclave-cured.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to a fiber-reinforced plastic
bar used for reinforcing concrete, etc.Reinforcing steel has been widely used in the past
as a reinforcing bar for cement, mortar, concrete, etc.
(hereinafter referred to as "concrete, etc,"). Recently,
various fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) bars have been
developed so as to satisfy the requirements such as
light-weight, corrosion resistance, and so forth.These bars are produced by solidifying reinforcing
fibers such as a carbon fiber, an aramide fiber, a glass
fiber, a vinylon fiber, etc. by a thermosetting resin
such as an epoxy resin, an unsaturated polyester resin,
etc, or a thermoplastic resin such as polyphenylene
sulfide (PPS), as a matrix material.To reinforce concrete, etc, by these fiber-reinforced
plastic bars, bonding strength between the
bars and concrete, etc, must be high.To satisfy this requirement, it has been a customary
practice to form corrugations or convexities on the bar
and to improve mechanical bonding power.As the method described above, there are a method of
imparting convexities to the FRP itself, and a method of
forming a surface member on the surface of the FRP and
then disposing convexities.The method of imparting convexities to the FRP
itself includes a method of making a part of the FRP flat
as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 63-206548, a method of forming protuberances
in the FRP as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent
Publication (Kokai) No. 2-92624, a method of twisting a
rod having a sectional shape other than a perfect circle 
as described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 1-192946, a method of using a braided rope as
described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication
(Kokai) No. 2-105830, and various others.However, each of the methods described above
involves the critical problems, that is, excess
production steps become necessary, production becomes
more difficult, and the strength of the FRP itself drops
because the reinforcing fibers are not oriented in the
reinforcing direction as they swell.Accordingly, the method which applies the surface
member to the FRP surface is excellent from the aspect of
the strength, and as definite methods of this kind, a
method of braiding organic fibers such as a polyester
fiber, a vinylon fiber, an acrylic fiber, etc, onto the
surface, and a method of winding an organic fiber
spirally on the surface, are known.On the other hand, concrete, etc, as cement is cured
and left as such cannot be practically used. Therefore,
