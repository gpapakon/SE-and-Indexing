<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to FSK demodulators and, in 
particular, is directed to medium speed FSK demodulators which use 
digital signal processing and are economical to manufacture. Most of the time, the voice-grade telephone line cannot be 
used directly to send digital signals because its bandwidth is limited. 
However the line can be used to send digital signals if the signals are 
first converted into analog signals whose frequencies fit within the voice-grade 
line bandwidth. Such a conversion is carried out at a data 
communication adapter commonly known as a modulator-demodulator 
or a "modem" for short. A modem both converts digital 
data from a digital computing machine into an analog signal suitable for 
transmission over voice-grade telephone lines, and also converts a 
received analog signal into digital data for use by a digital computing 
machine. Among various modulation techniques one type of the 
Frequency Modulation (FM) known as Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) is 
very popular for modems operating at a medium or low speed, such as 
at bit rates less than 1800 bps (bits per second). In FSK, two different 
frequency tones are used to represent "zero" (or space) and "ones" (or 
mark) bits. When a "one" bit is sent to the modem, a low frequency 
tone is output to the telephone line. When a "zero" bit is sent to the 
modem, a high frequency tone is produced. The FSK signal is coherent, 
that is to say, the mark and space frequencies follow each other's phase 
continuously. Typically for the 1200 baud transmission, the mark 
frequency is 1200 Hz and the space frequency is 2200 Hz. U.S. Patent No. 4,568,882 (Single), issued February 4, 1986, 
describes a digital FSK demodulator which uses modified mark and 
space filters to produce mark and space filter outputs. The outputs are  
 
rectified and compared with one another at a comparator to generate a 
baseband signal. U.S. Patent No. 4,752,742 (Akaiwa), issued June 21, 1988, 
teaches a FSK signal demodulator with a quadrature detector. The 
demodulator includes, in addition to the quadrature detector, a local 
oscillator and a logic circuit. The local oscillator has an oscillation 
frequency substantially equal to the centre frequency of the received 
signal to produce a baseband signal in a quadrature phase relationship. 
The baseband signal is produced as an output of the logic circuits, 
depending upon whether the received FSK signal frequency is higher or 
lower than the local oscillator frequency. U.S. Patent No. 4,785,255
