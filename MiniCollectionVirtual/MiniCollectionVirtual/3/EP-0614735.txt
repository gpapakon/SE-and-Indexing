<ABSTRACT>
A router (21) has a base (70) joined to a body 
(60) by columns (62,64), the latter being slidable in 

sleeves (66) in the body (60). A spring (90) between the 
base (70) and the body of the router serves as a guard for 

the router bit (76).

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to routing machines, and 
particularly to guards therefor and especially to such 
routers for use in machining centres. A machining centre usually comprises a work table 
on which a processing tool, for example, a router or milling 
cutter, moves along three Cartesian axes. The centre may be 
controlled by a computer, e.g. a personal computer, in which 
must be first installed a processing program. A vertical 
guide supports a first carriage which runs along the guide 
by means of a first motor. The tool is fixed to the first 
carriage. The vertical guide is supported by a second 
carriage, running by means of a second motor along a first 
horizontal guide which is supported at one end by a third 
carriage running by means of a third motor along a second 
horizontal guide. The second horizontal guide is arranged at 
a right angle to the first horizontal guide, and the support 
moves along the three Cartesian axes over the horizontal 
work table. The three motors are connected to the computer, 
which may be integrated in the machine and may comprise a 
microprocessor sending to the motors signals for movement by 
reading position and movement data from memories connected 
thereto. In stationery machinery, such as the type to 
which the present invention relates, and where the tool is a 
standard router, 
as known, for example, from EP-A-473 035, 
or indeed any milling tool, it must be 
provided with guarding in order to protect operators from 
inadvertently contacting the tool bit and possibly injuring 
themselves. Such guarding is not normally available for 
hand held routers because the operator must hold the router 
and consequently has no occasion to insert his/her hand into 
contact with the tool bit. Consequently, it is an object of the present 
invention to provide a router which overcomes these 
disadvantages, or at least mitigates their effects.  
 In accordance with this invention, there is 
provided a router comprising a body which houses a motor 
driving a rotary tool bit depending from said body, at least 
one column being slidable with respect to said body along an 
axis parallel the rotation axis of said bit and mounting a 
router base having an aperture through which said tool is 
adapted to plunge to perform cutting operations, and a guard 
comprising a coil spring between said base and body and 
surrounding said bit axis. Needless to say, to be effective, the spring 
should have a pitch when fully extended which is 
insufficient to permit easy insertion of a

<CLAIMS>
A router comprising a body which houses a 
motor driving a rotary tool bit depending from said body, at 

least one column being slidable with respect to said body 
along an axis parallel the rotation axis of said bit and 

mounting a router base having an aperture through which said 
tool is adapted to plunge to perform cutting operations, and 

a guard comprising a coil spring between said base and body 
and surrounding said bit axis. 
A router as claimed in claim 1, in which the 
spring has a pitch when fully extended which is insufficient 

to permit easy insertion of a standard finger between 
adjacent turns of the spring. 
A router as claimed in claim 1 or 2, in 
which said spring is employed as the return spring for said 

base, and serves to bias the base and body apart.
