<ABSTRACT>
A method and reagent system for the rapid isolation, 
identification, and/or analysis of leukocytes from a whole 

blood sample. The reagent system includes a lytic reagent 
solution comprising an aqueous solution of a water soluble 

compound which at least partially dissociates in aqueous 
solution to release a proton and a counterion and which, 

upon contact with a blood sample, acidifies the sample to 
a pH in the range of from about 2.6 to 4.0. The reagent 

system also includes a quenching reagent solution 
comprising an aqueous alkaline salt solution which 

effectively and rapidly arrests the chemical action of the 
lytic reagent solution on the sample and restores the 

native physiological environment of the sample. The method 
comprises using the reagent system to selectively lyse the 

red blood cells in a blood sample and modify the leukocytes 
to enable their differentiation into five sub-populations.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to aqueous lytic reagent 
systems and their use in partitioning whole blood samples.  
 Description of the Prior Art - The separation of complex biological 
fluids (i.e. whole blood) into its various constituents preliminary 
to study and analysis of its component parts, is generally 
desirable and often an essential requirement of many established 
analytical protocols and/or instrumentation utilized in such 
studies and analysis. Where such study or analysis of the fluid 
fraction of the sample is of primary interest, the cellular fraction 
is separated from the sample without regard for maintaining the 
cell viability or membrane integrity. Conversely, where the 
cellular fraction is itself of primary interest to the researcher or 
clinician, the partitioning of the whole blood sample into its 
various cellular components requires that the sample 
treatment/processing techniques be adjusted accordingly. The 
traditional methods for separation of whole blood samples into its 
various cellular components is by centrifugation. While this 
process is effective, it is labor intensive, relatively inefficient and 
requires physical manipulation of the cellular fraction of the 
sample. Where such separation/partitioning of the cellular fraction of the 
sample is attempted with chemical agents, the results have been 
less than totally satisfactory for a variety of reasons. More 
specifically, the vitality and viability of a cell population invivo 
or invitro is dependent upon maintaining a precise physiological 
environment that is consistent with the preservation of physical 
cell structure and chemical balance within the cell. This balance 
is controlled by the permeability and transport characteristics of 
the cell membrane. Alteration in the physiological environment 
will in turn evoke a response or change in the cell membrane. 
The membrane response is "defensive" in nature; that is, the 
physiological response of the membrane is calculated to maintain 
the chemical balance within the cell and, thus, its continued and 
uninterrupted vitality.  
 It is fully appreciated that such alteration in the ideal 
physiological environment of the cell can be tolerated only within 
limits; and, that when such limits are exceeded, permanent injury 
to the cell can occur. As is further appreciated in the art, such 
changes in environment (i.e. toxicity of the diluting medium - 
even with distilled water) can effect hemolysis of the cells. The degree of tolerance of various cell populations in
