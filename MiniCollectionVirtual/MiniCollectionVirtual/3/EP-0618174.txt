<ABSTRACT>
Preparation of transparent yellow iron oxide pigments by precipitation of iron(II) hydroxide by addition of an inorganic base to an iron(II) salt solution and subsequent oxidation to FeOOH, in which   a) an aqueous iron(II) salt solution having a molarity of at least 0.5 is first admixed at from 25 to 45@C in the presence of dissolved phosphates and, if desired, zinc salts with sufficient base for from 50 to 70% of the iron(II) ions used to be precipitated as hydroxide, then oxidising gas is passed through the mixture obtained until the pH has dropped to a value 
<
 4.5, and b) the temperature of the mixture is subsequently increased to from 50 to 80@C and the precipitation of the iron as FeOOH is completed by further addition of base while maintaining a pH of from 4 to 6 and simultaneously passing in oxidising gas, and the precipitated pigment is subsequenty isolated from the aqueous suspension in a conventional manner, and also transparent yellow iron oxide pigments based on doped FeOOH.

<CLAIMS>
A process for preparing transparent yellow iron 
oxide pigments by precipitation of iron(II) hydroxide by 

addition of an inorganic base to an iron(II) salt 
solution and subsequent oxidation to FeOOH, which 

comprises 

a) admixing an at least 0.5 M aqueous iron(II) salt 
solution at from 25 to 45°C in the presence of 

dissolved phosphates and optionally zinc salts 
initially with sufficient base to precipitate from 

50 to 70% of the starting iron(II) ions in the form 
of the hydroxide and then passing oxidizing gas 

through the resulting mixture until the pH has 
fallen to a value 
<
 4.5, and 
b) then raising the temperature of the mixture to 50-80°C 
and, by further addition of base while a pH of 

from 4 to 6 is maintained and the simultaneous 
introduction of oxidizing gas, completing the precipitation 

of the iron in the form of FeOOH and then 
isolating the precipitated pigment from the aqueous 

suspension in a conventional manner. 
A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the 
precipitation of step a) is carried out in the presence 

of dissolved phosphates and zinc salts. 
A process as claimed in claim 1 or 2, wherein the 
precipitation of step a) is carried out in the presence 

of from 0.05 to 2% by weight of phosphorus in the form of 
phosphate, based on FeOOH. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 3, 
wherein the precipitation of step a) is carried out in 

the presence of from 0.1 to 3% by weight of zinc, based  
 

on FeOOH. 
A process as claimed in any of claims 1 to 4, 
wherein, before it is isolated or after it has been 

isolated and then redispersed in an aqueous phase, the 
pigment is additionally coated with a phosphate. 
A process as claimed in claim 5, wherein the 
pigment is additionally coated with from 0.1 to 1% by 

weight of phosphorus in the form of phosphate. 
Transparent yellow iron oxide pigments based on 
doped FeOOH, wherein the dopant comprises 


A) from 0.05 to 2% by weight of phosphorus in the form 
of phosphate and 
B) from 0.1 to 3% by weight of zinc. 
The use of the pigments of claim 7 for coloring 
polymeric material.
