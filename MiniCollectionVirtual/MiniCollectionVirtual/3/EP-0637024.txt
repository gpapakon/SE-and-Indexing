data part from a reproduced signal data series, a

transmission path characteristics estimator (4) for modeling
an impulse response between a recording system (7) and a

reproducing system (8) with the synchronizing signal data
part detected by the synchronizing signal data detector (3)

being used as a reference signal, and a decoder (5) for
decoding a recorded signal data series according to a Viterbi

algorithm based on a transmission model produced by the

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a magnetic reproducing 
apparatus suitable with a partial response decoder for 
playing back a magnetic recording medium on which digital 
data have been magnetically recorded through a partial response 
encoder. Systems for magnetically recording and reproducing 
digital data are generally of the partial response arrangement 
in which digital data are recorded on a magnetic 
recording medium through a partial response encoder with a 
view to increasing the recording density or statistically 
eliminating DC components by effecting spectral shaping on a 
recording system, and digital data are obtained from a signal 
reproduced from the magnetic recording medium through a 
partial response decoder. The partial response scheme allows digital data to 
be recorded and reproduced highly efficiently under ideal 
transmission conditions. However, if the frequency band of 
recording and reproducing systems is insufficient or the 
overall frequency characteristics suffer deterioration though 
the frequency band itself is sufficient, then the partial 
response design is subject to intersymbol interference,  
 
resulting in a large increase in the error rate. It is therefore an object of the present invention 
to provide a magnetic reproducing apparatus for accurately 
reproducing digital data from a magnetic recording medium on 
which such digital data have been magnetically recorded 
through a partial response encoder. According to the present invention, there is provided 
a magnetic reproducing apparatus for playing back a 
magnetic recording medium on which digital data have been 
magnetically recorded through a partial response encoder, 
comprising synchronizing signal data detecting means for detecting 
a synchronizing signal data part from a reproduced 
signal data series, transmission path characteristics estimating 
means for modeling an impulse response between a 
recording system and a reproducing system with the synchronizing 
signal data part detected by the synchronizing signal 
data detecting means being used as a reference signal, and 
decoding means for decoding a recorded signal data series according 
to a Viterbi algorithm based on a transmission model 
produced by the transmission path characteristics estimating 
means. The transmission path characteristics estimating 
means may comprise means for modeling the impulse response 
between the recording system and the reproducing system using 
the method of least squares with the synchronizing signal 
data part used
