<ABSTRACT>
Radiation detection device, with abutting detection elements, and method of manufacturing this device. This device comprises at least two abutting detection elements (16, 18) having a plurality of photodetectors (22, 24) on one face, and a supplementary detection element (26) having a plurality of photodetectors (28) on one face and placed astride the two abutting elements, the photodetectors of this supplementary element being opposite the said phases of the two abutting elements which do not have any photodetector opposite the photodetectors of the supplementary element. Application to thermal imaging.

<CLAIMS>
Radiation detection device incorporating at least two abutting detection
elements (16, 18, 56), each element being made from a material

transparent to the radiation and having, on one face, a plurality of photodetectors
(22, 24, 64) able to detect the radiation, said device being

characterized in that it also comprises, for both abutting elements, a
complimentary detection element (26, 62) having, one one face, a plurality

of photodetectors (28, 66) able to detect the radiation, in that said
complimentary element is placed astride the two abutting elements, the

photodetectors of said complimentary elements being positioned facing said
faces of the two abutting elements, and in that said two abutting elements

have no photodetector facing the photodetectors of the complimentary element.
Device according to claim 1, characterized in that it also comprises a
substrate (20, 58) having at least one opening (30, 60), said opening being

able to receive the complimentary element, in that the two abutting elements
are hybridized on the substrate by electrically conductive balls (36, 38)

and in that the complimentary detection element is connected to the substrate
by means of electrical connections (44) formed on the abutting

elements and the electrically conductive balls (36, 46).
Device according to claim 2, characterized in that the substrate
comprises a single opening (30) able to receive each complimentary element

(26), or a plurality of openings (60), each being able to receive one
complimentary element (62).
Device according to any one of the claims 1 to 3, characterized in that
each of the abutting elements, as well as the cor
responding complimentary
element comprises a row of photodetectors having a given step size and in

that the number of photodetectors of the complimentary element is chosen
so as to obtain, when said complimentary element is placed astride the

corresponding abutting elements, a single row of photodetectors having
said given step size.
Process for the production of the device according to claim 2,
 
characterized in that it comprises the following stages:


the substrate (20) provided with the opening (30) is produced,
the abutting detection elements (16, 18) are hybridized on said substrate,
and
the complimentary element (26) is assembled with the thus obtained
structure through the opening (30) of the substrate (20).
