<ABSTRACT>
The invention concerns a method for ventilation of the pocket 
spaces (T) in a multi-cylinder dryer of a paper machine, in 

particular of a high-speed paper machine whose running speed 
is higher than 800 metres per minute, in the area of so-called 

twin-wire draw. In the twin-wire draw the drying cylinders 
(11,12) in the drying group have been arranged in two rows 

(R₁,R₂) placed one above the other, in which rows the successive 
cylinders (11,12) are placed in the upper row and in the 

lower row as interlocked and in each of which cylinder groups 
there are two drying wires (F₁,F₂), an upper wire (F₁) and a 

lower wire (F₂), by whose means the paper web (W) is pressed 
against the heated faces of drying cylinders, being guided by 

guide rolls placed in the gaps between the cylinders, in which 
the paper web (W) runs as free draws between the rows of 

cylinders. The pocket spaces (T) are formed in the area between 
the free draws of the web (W) and the upper wire (F₁) 

and its guide roll and the drying cylinder (12) in the lower row 
and, in a corresponding way, the adjacent pocket spaces (T) are 

formed in the area between the free draws of the web (W), the 
lower wire (F₂), its guide roll, and the drying cylinder (11) in 

the upper row. In the method, the pocket spaces (T) are ventilated 
by means of pumpings of air induced by the wire (F₁;F₂) 

in the multi-cylinder dryer, wherein, at the inlet side of the 
guide roll, the wire (F₁;F₂) pumps air into the pocket spaces 

(T) through the wire (F₁;F₂), and wherein the wire (F₁;F₂) 
pumps air out of the pocket spaces (T) at the outlet side of the 

guide roll of the wire (F₁;F₂). In the method, pumping-out 
through the wire (F₁;F₂) on its run at the outlet side from the 

guide roll to the following cylinder (11;12) is limited as compared 
with free pumping-in and pumping-out so as to control  

 
the pressure level and/or the flow status in the pocket spaces 

(T). The invention also concerns an apparatus for ventilation of 
a pocket space in a multi-cylinder dryer of a paper machine in 

the area of so-called twin-wire draw, in which, in the twin-wire 
draw, the drying cylinders (11,12) in the drying group have 

been arranged in two horizontal rows placed one above the 
other, in which the successive cylinders (11,12) are placed in 

the upper row and in the lower row as interlocked, and in each 
of which cylinder groups there are two drying wires (F₁,F₂), 

an upper wire (F₁) and a lower wire (F₂), by whose means the 
paper web (W) is pressed against the heated drying-cylinder 

faces, being guided by guide rolls placed in the gaps between 
the cylinders, in which the paper web (W) runs as free dra
ws 
between the cylinder rows. The pocket space (T) is formed in 

the area between the free draws of the web (W) and the upper 
wire (F₁) and its guide roll and the drying cylinder (12) of the 

lower row (R₂), and, in a corresponding way, the adjacent 
pocket space (T) is formed in the area between the free draws 

of the web (W), the lower wire (F₂), its guide roll, and the 
drying cylinder (11) in the upper row. In the area of the run of 

the wire (F₁;F₂) from the guide roll to the following cylinder 
(11;12), an obstructing device (20) is fitted, which reduces the 

amount of air that escapes from the pocket space (T).
