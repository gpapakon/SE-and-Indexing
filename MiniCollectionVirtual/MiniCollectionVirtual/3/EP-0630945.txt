<ABSTRACT>
Azo dyes of the formula  W(-X-Y-Chr)n  where     n is from 2 to 6,   Y is C1-C6-alkylene,   Chr is the radical of a mono- or polyazo dye,   X is a radical of the formula CO-O or O-CO and W is an n-valent radical derived from a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C20-alkane, a substituted or unsubstituted C4-C7-cycloalkane, a substituted or unsubstituted benzene or a substituted or unsubstituted naphthalene, or, where n is 4, can also be silicon, and their use in nonlinear optics or for dyeing or printing textile materials.
