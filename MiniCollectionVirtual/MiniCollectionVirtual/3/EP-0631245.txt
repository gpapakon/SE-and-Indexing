<ABSTRACT>
Arbitrarily large document collections are processed by expanding a focus set having 
at least one initial metadocument (82) into a plurality of subsequent metadocuments 

(83,84,85,86). The number of subsequent metadocuments is approximately equal to a 
predetermined maximum number. The subsequent metadocuments are then clustered into a 

predetermined number of new metadocuments, which are summarized and presented to a 
user. The focus set is redefined to include only user-selected new metadocuments.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a method of processing a corpus of electronically stored
metadocuments according to the subject matter of claim 1.Document browsing is a powerful tool used in accessing large tea collections. Browsing,
which can be distinguished from searching because browsing is query-free, works well for information
needs either too general or too vague to be usefully expressed as a query in some search language.
For example, a user may be unfamiliar with vocabulary appropriate for describing a topic of interest,
or may not wish to commit to a particular choice of words. Indeed, a user may not be looking for
anything specific at all, but instead may wish to explore the general information content of the
collection. Helpful in this context is an information access system including a navigable collection
outline that both suggests the collection's contents and allows a user to focus attention on some
topic-coherent subset of the contents.One such browsing system is described in a paper entitled "Scatter/Gather: A Cluster-Based
Approach to Browsing Large Document Collections," Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual
International ACM SIGIR Conference, pages 318-329, June 1992, by Cutting, Karger, Pedersen, and
Tukey. This system and method are also disclosed in EP 0 542 429 A.In the Scatter/Gather method, attention is always directed toward a focus set of documents
potentially interesting to a user. Initially the focus set may be an entire document collection. The
documents in the focus set are clustered into a small number of topic-coherent subsets, or clusters,
of documents. The terms "clustering" and "scattering" are used synonymously; thus it may be said
that the documents in the focus set are scattered into the clusters.In Scatter/Gather, cluster summaries, a table of contents outlining the documents of the
focus set, are developed and presented to the user, for example on a computer display screen. The
user then identifies and selects clusters that appear most interesting. The selected clusters define a
new, smaller focus set that is the union of the selected clusters. The process is repeated a desired
number of times until the user wishes to access documents individually or employ a query-based
search method.Cluster summaries comprise suggestive text determined automatically from documents in
each cluster. Each cluster summary includes two types of information: a list of topical words
occurring most often in the documents of the cluster, and the titles of a few typical documents in

<CLAIMS>
A method of processing a corpus of electronically stored metadocuments,
comprising the steps of:


a) placing a focus set (100) on the corpus of metadocuments, wherein the
focus set comprises at least one initial metadocument (82),

representing a plurality of documents
b) choosing a metadocument in the focus set (100) that represents the

most individual documents;
c) expanding the chosen metadocument into a plurality of subsequent
metadocuments, being descendants in a hierarchical tree structure

of the chosen metadocument;
d) repeating steps b) and c) until the number of metadocuments in the
focus set (100) is approximately equal to a predetermined maximum

number; and in that case
e) clustering the subsequent metadocuments into a predetermined
number of new metadocuments, wherein the predetermined number is

less than the predetermined maximum number which is determined so
that steps b) to e) together can be completed within a time constraint.
The method as claimed in claim 1, 
characterized in that
 said at least one
initial metadocument (82) is a single metadocument representative of said

entire corpus of documents. 
The method as claimed in claims 1 or 2, 
characterized by
 determining a
summary of the new metadocuments; and presenting the summary to a user.
The method as claimed in claim 3, 
characterized by
 redefining the focus set
(100) to include only user-selected new metadocuments, the summary

including:

a fixed number of topical words that occur most often in each new metadocument;
and
the title of at least one typical document within each new metadocument, and
wherein each document and each new metadocument is represented by a set of

word-frequency pairs, and the at least one typical document within each new
metadocument is defined by determining which document or documents within

each new metadocument are represented by a set of word-frequency pairs most
similar to the set of word-frequency pairs that represents each respective new

metadocument.
The method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 4, 
characterized in that

each document is represented as a set of word-frequency pairs, and wherein
each metadocument is represented as a set of word-frequency pairs

determined from a sum of sets of word-frequency pairs of documents
represented by the metadocument.
The method as claimed in any one of claims 1 to 5, 
characterized in that
 the
hierarchical tree structure (81) having a root node, plural intermediate nodes

depending from said root node and from other intermediate nodes, and leaves
dependent from some of said intermediate nodes, and wherein said root node

is the initial metadocument representing said corpus of documents and said
intermediate nodes are the subsequent metadocuments.
