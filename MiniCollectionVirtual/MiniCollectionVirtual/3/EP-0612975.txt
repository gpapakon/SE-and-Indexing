<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to method and apparatus for measuring and displaying the 
eccentricity or off-set position with respect to coaxiality of a metallic conductor 

within an insulating coating during an extrusion process. The measuring 
apparatus employs a combination of optical (2,5,6,7) and 

electrically inductive 
techniques to determine respectively the position of the outer coating of the 

cable (3) and that of the core (4) within the cable. 
By relating these positional 

measurements it is possible to determine the position 
of the core (4) relative to a 

desired location namely the coaxial position so that appropriate corrections can 
be made to the extrusion process to keep the core (4) in that 

coaxial position.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the formation of an electrical cable by
extrusion techniques and particularly to a method and apparatus for monitoring
the position of the conductor core of the cable in relation to the outer extruded
coating in order that the extrusion process can be controlled to maintain the
core on the central axis of the cable.During the manufacture of an electrical cable by means of continuous
extrusion, an inner conductor wire such as of copper, aluminium, steel or other
electrically conductive material is coated with an insulating material of plastics,
rubber and the like, the coating being applied as by extrusion from an extruder
through which the inner conductor is passed at a predetermined speed.The finished product coming from the extruder then undergoes a cooling
process which cools the hot plastics or rubber coating issuing from the hot
extruder whereafter the product is wound onto a drum or reel.To preserve the electrical and mechanical characteristics of the cable, it is
important that the inner conductor is located along the central axis of the cable.Eccentricity measurements of electrical cables based
on a combination of optical measurements for the detection
of the position of the coating and of inductive measurements
for the detection of the position of the core are for
instance described in EP-A- 0 457 316, US-A- 4 086 044
or GB-A- 2 160 654. It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a method and
apparatus for determining the position of the conductor core of an electrical
cable during an extrusion process so as to ensure that it is maintained in a
central cable axial position during the process.According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided apparatus
for determining the position of the conductor core of an electrical cable being
formed in an extrusion process comprising optical means for transmitting a
beam of light across the cable, detector means for receiving that portion of the
transmitted beam not obscured by the cable and providing output signals
representative of the position of the outer surface of the cable across a
predetermined cross section in the cable run, electrical inductive means
positioned to either side of the cable at said predetermined cross section to
provide when energised, induced magnetic fields in the vicinity of the cable,
means for detecting variation in current in said inductive means in response to
movement of the conductor core through said fields corresponding to a change
in position of the
