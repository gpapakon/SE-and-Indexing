<ABSTRACT>
The plane of at least one groove (21) containing a pulley cable (3) running round the outer periphery of the winder disc (2) contains a hub bore (22) diametrically penetrating the central hub part of the winder disc. The lengthwise section (3a) of the pulley cable runs through the hub bore, between its two ends. The two outer orifices of the hub bore widen out radially so as to curve backwards. Two cable pulley through-holes (4,5) in the housing periphery wall (1a) are diametrically opposite on the same plane as the cable pulley holder groove.

Rotary fastener for adjustable and releasable drawing 
together of two closure elements which can be braced relative 

to one another, comprising 

a) at least one traction cable (3) which can be wound and 
co-operates with one of the two closure elements, 
b) a winding pulley (2) rotatably mounted in a housing (1) 
for winding on and unwinding of the traction cable (3), 

wherein this traction cable is passed through holes (4, 
5) in the peripheral wall (1a), 
c) a rotary actuating spindle (6) which is rotatably 
mounted substantially in the centre of the housing (1) 

and is in drive connection with the winding pulley by 
way of a gearing arrangement (7), 
d) a releasable ratchet arrangement (20) for fixing the 
rotary actuating spindle (6) and the winding pulley (2) 

in a setting of the rotary closure, 
 
wherein 


e) the winding pulley (2) has running around its outer 
circumference two traction cable receiving grooves (21, 

21a) machined in two planes lying parallel to one 
another, 
f) in the plane of at least one of these two traction cable 
receiving grooves (21, 21a) there is provided a hub 

bore (22, 22c) which diametrally traverses a central hub 
region of this winding pulley and through which the 

traction cable (3) is loosely passed with a central 
longitudinal portion (3a, 3b) located between its two  

 
ends. 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the two outer mouth portions (22a, 22b) of the hub bore 

(22, 22c) are increasingly widened outwards in the radial 
direction in such a way that - when considered in a top view 

of the winding pulley (2) and in the direction of winding 
thereof (23) - they extend so that they are curved backwards 

with the groove width remaining constant. 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 
that two traction cable holes (4, 5) are disposed in the 

peripheral housing wall (1a) in the same plane as the traction 
cable receiving groove (21, 21a) and lie approximately 

diametrally opposite one another. 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 2, characterised in 
that two traction cable holes (4', 5') are disposed in the 

peripheral housing wall (1a) in the same plane as the traction 
cable receiving groove (21, 21a) and have a peripheral spacing 

(UA) of less than 180°, preferably of approximately 90° from 
one another. 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that two traction cable receiving holes (4, 5) lying 

approximately diametrally opposite one another in the 
peripheral housing wall (1a) are co-ordinated with both 

traction cable receiving grooves (21, 21a). 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that a diametral hub bore (22, 22c) is provided which is 

associated with each of the two traction cable receiving 
grooves (21, 21a), wherein central longitudinal portions (3a, 

3b) of the traction cable (3) are loosely passed through both 
hub bores in such a way that on the one hand the two ends (3c, 

3d) of this traction cable and on the other hand an outer loop  

 
(3e) of traction cable formed by a longitudinal portion of 

traction cable located outside the housing (1) are in closing 
engagement with the closure elements. 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the two ends (3c, 3d) of the traction cable (3) are fixed 

in the plane of the second traction sable receiving groove 
(21a) in the winding pulley hub (15), preferably secured by 

ultrasonic welding, wherein two outer loops (3e, 3f) of 
traction cable formed outside the housing (1) are in closing 

engagement with the closure elements. 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the longitudinal portions of traction cable inserted into 

the two traction cable receiving grooves (21, 21a) extend 
approximately parallel to one another in the starting position 

of the winding pulley (2). 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that the longitudinal portions of traction cable inserted into 

the two traction cable receiving grooves (21, 21a) cross over 
one another, preferably extending approximately at right 

angles to one another, in the starting position of the winding 
pulley (2). 
Rotary fastener as claimed in Claim 1, characterised in 
that one end (6a) of the rotary actuating spindle (6) 

protrudes into a central axial bore (14) in the winding pulley 
hub (15) and bears a disconnectable coupling element (11a) of 

a coupling (11) which is provided in the drive connection 
between the rotary actuating spindle and the gearing 

arrangement and which can be disconnected by axial pressure 
actuation (13) of the rotary actuating spindle which can be 

exerted against a spring force, and that the axial length of 
the end portion of the axial bore (14) which receives one end 

(6a) of the rotary actuating spindle (6) and the coupling  
 

element (11a) from the corresponding outer face (2a) of the 
winding pulley (2) to the nearest hub bore (22, 22c)
