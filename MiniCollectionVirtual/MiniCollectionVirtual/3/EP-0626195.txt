<ABSTRACT>
In a process for mixing reaction resins with hardeners, fillers and the like on construction sites, the delivery drum (1) is furnished with an attachment (2). As a result, a volume is available which is sufficiently large so that all the components can be mixed in the mixing vessel thus comprising delivery drum (1) and attachment (2), without the components having to be specially poured into new containers.

<CLAIMS>
A method for mixing reaction resins with hardeners, fillers and the similar substances at
construction sites using the barrel (1), in which the reaction resin is supplied, as a mixing

vessel, 
characterized
 in that a mixing vessel with a collar (1a) protruding outward at the open
edge and with a headpiece (2) for increasing the capacity is used, the headpiece (2) having

an outwardly protruding bead (2a) at an open edge and having an outer contour corresponding
to the outer contour of barrel (1), and that a clamping ring (3) embracing the collar (1a) of the

mixing vessel and the bead (2a) of the headpiece (2) is used.
