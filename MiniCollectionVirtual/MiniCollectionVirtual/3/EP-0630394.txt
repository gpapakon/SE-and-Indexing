<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to solvent mixtures. In 
particular, it relates to mixtures of monochlorotoluene and 
monochlorobenzotrifluoride, which can optimally contain 
perchloroethylene. 1,1,1-trichloroethane has been a widely used solvent in 
many industries, because it is nonflammable, dissolves most 
soluble polymers, and evaporates quickly. However, it has 
been found to deplete the ozone layer in the stratosphere, and 
regulations now limit its use and it may soon be prohibited 
entirely for many applications. Users of 
1,1,1-trichloroethane are presently searching for substitute 
solvents with the same desirable properties, but which will 
not attack the ozone layer. I have discovered that mixtures of monochlorotoluene with 
monochlorobenzotrifluoride, especially when mixed with 
perchloroethylene, have almost the same desirable properties 
that 1,1,1-trichloroethane has, but are not expected to attack 
the ozone layer. Because about two years are required for a 
solvent released on the ground to reach the ozone layer in the 
stratosphere, and the solvents used in this invention have an 
atmospheric life in the troposphere of only about sixty days, 
they should not be ozone depleters. The solvent formulations  
 
of this invention are good solvents for most organic polymers, 
evaporate rapidly, and, when they include perchloroethylene, 
are nonflammable. Very unexpectedly, I have discovered that even though 
parachlorobenzotrifluoride evaporates only about half as fast 
as perchloroethylene, nevertheless, some mixtures of 
parachlorobenzotrifluoride with orthochlorotoluene evaporate 
faster than do mixtures of perchloroethylene with 
orthochlorotoluene. As yet, I have found no explanation for 
this unusual phenomena. Figure 1 is a graph where the abscissa is the volume 
percent of parachlorobenzotrifluoride (line A) or 
perchloroethylene (line B) mixed with orthochlorotoluene and 
the ordinate is the evaporation time in seconds. Figure 2 is a graph where the abscissa is the volume 
percent of parachlorobenzotrifluoride (line A) or 
perchloroethylene (line B) mixed with mineral spirits and the 
ordinate is the evaporation time in seconds. Both graphs are 
further explained in Example 1. This invention is for a mixture of solvents, where the 
mixture includes monochlorotoluene and monochlorobenzotrifluoride.  
 
The solvents used in the mixtures of this invention 
are available and can be purchased. Monochlorotoluene has the 
general formula 
 
and monochlorobenzotrifluoride has the general formula
