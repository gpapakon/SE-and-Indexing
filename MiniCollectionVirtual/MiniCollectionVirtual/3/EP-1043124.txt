<ABSTRACT>
The clamping device (1) for workpieces (4) has at least two clamping chucks (2, 3), of which at least one can be displaced a the table (6) of the machine tool and locked at both sides to the carrier (5), with subsequent adjustment possible. This chuck ( has a bearing stand (8) on the carrier with second-stage clamping chucks (7) on it.

<CLAIMS>
Device (1) for clamping workpieces (4) to be machined, consisting of at least two
clamping jaws (2. 3) having bearing shoulders (9, 10) for a clamped workpiece

(4), at least one (3) of which is displaceable along a stationary carrier (5) and can
be locked and adjusted on either side of the support (5) in the direction of its

extent, this clamping jaw (3) having a bearing support (8) which can be mounted
on the carrier (5) and a reclamping jaw (7) steplessly adjustable thereon along a

guide plane formed by a guide arrangement and inclined in the clamping
direction, in the form of a conical wedge which can be driven in between the

inclined guide plane and a workpiece (4), and the carrier (5) having a T-slot guide
(24) extending in the direction of its extent and a surface (26) having a

strip-shaped longitudinal profile on either side in the direction of its extent
cooperating with the bearing support (8) for the positive positioning of the

clamping jaw (3), 
characterised in that
 the bearing support (8) is screwed at its
underside on to a guide wedge (27) projecting into the T-slot guide (24) and in

which a tensioning device (25) which can be raised towards the shoulders (40) of
the T-slot guide (24) is mounted, the tensioning device having a rotatable shaft

(29) arranged in the clamping direction on which tightening bars (41) of a
clamping device (38) mounted on the shaft (29) which can be raised towards

shoulders (40) of the T-slot guide (24) are provided.
Device according to claim 1, 
characterised in that
, when the bearing support (8) is
mounted on the carrier (5), the eccentric shaft (29) can be locked against rotation

by friction between a portion (37) of the shaft (29) and the clamping device (38).
Device according to claim 2, 
characterised in that
 the guide arrangement (11) has
a guide slot (23) receiving the reclamping jaw (7) in the bearing support (8) and a

tensioning bolt (18) secured in the bearing support (8) and traversing the
reclamping jaw (7) in the direction of displacement.
Device according to one of claims 1 to 3, 
characterised in that
 the guide
arrangement (11) is formed by two guide planes (12, 13) offset from one another. 
Device according to claim 4, 
characterised in that
 the tensioning bolt (18) is
secured in the bearing support (8) in a step (14) formed by the offset guide planes

(12, 13).
Device according to claim 4 or claim 5, 
characterised in that
 the reclamping jaw
(7) is guided into side slots (42) in the bearing support (8) extending in the

direction of displacement and laterally adjoining a guide slot (23).
Device according to claim 5 or claim 6, 
characterised in that
 the reclamping jaw
(7) is acted upon in the direction of displacement by a spring (22) supported on

the step (14) and at least partially releasing a bearing shoulder (10) of the bearing
support (8).
