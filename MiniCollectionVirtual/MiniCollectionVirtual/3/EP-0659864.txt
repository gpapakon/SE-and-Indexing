<ABSTRACT>
A fluorescent substance is comprised of a praseodymium- 
activated yttrium and/or rare earth oxysulfide represented 

by the chemical formula, R
2(1-x)
Pr
2x
O₂S, wherein R stands 
for at least one member selected from the group consisting 

of Y, Gd, La, and Lu and x for a numerical value satisfying 
the expression, 5 x 10⁻⁵ ≦ x ≦ 1 x 10⁻², and the substance 

having a linear absorption coefficient of not more than 
6.0 cm⁻¹ at 550 nm. Preferably the fluorescent substance 

contains PO₄ in an amount of not more than 100 ppm. 
Substances of improved luminous emission intensity can be 

produced for use in radiation detectors and in X-ray CT 
apparatus.

<DESCRIPTION>
This invention is concerned with fluorescent substances
based on Pr-activated rare earth oxysulfides, methods for
their production radiation detectors which incorporate the
fluorescent substance, and an X-ray CT apparatus. More
particularly, this invention is directed to Pr-activated
rare earth oxysulfide fluorescent substances having highly
desirable capacity for light emission, their production,
their use in radiation detectors and in X-ray CT apparatus
which incorporate such radiation detectors.Nondestructive inspection of a body under test by means
of X-ray CT has been widespread particularly in the medical
and industrial fields. In the X-ray CT apparatus employed
for this inspection, a detector utilizes a scintillator for
detecting radiation transmitted through a given body. The
scintillator is a substance which, on being stimulated as
by the X-ray, emits a visible radiation or electromagnetic
waves of a wavelength approximating that of a visible
radiation. Previously known scintillator materials include
single crystals such as NaI, CsI, and CdWO4, ceramics such
as BaFClEu, LaOBr:Tb, CsI:T1, CaWO4, and CdWO4, the cubic
rare earth oxide ceramics disclosed in JP-A-59-27,283, and
the rare earth oxysulfide ceramics such as Gd2O2S:Pr
disclosed in JP-A-58-204,088.Among materials for the scintillator mentioned above,
the rare earth oxysulfide ceramics such as Gd2O2S:Pr are
attractive because of their high luminous efficiency.
However, the sulphide-forming agent which is mixed with a
rare earth oxide powder and the alkali metal salt of
phosphoric acid which is used as a flux persist in the
fluorescent substance and have been found to impede improvement
of their light transmission properties.In an effort to reduce this problem, JP-A-03-243,686,
for example, is concerned with modifying a fluorescent
substance to retain its desirable sintering property and
acquire improved crystallinity and light transmission 
properties by limiting within specific ranges the amounts of
alkali metals and phosphorus which persist.The fluorescent substance disclosed in JP-A-03-243,686,
however, is still deficient in luminous emission intensity
and it is desirable to seek still further improvement.An object of this invention is the provision of
fluorescent substances having improved luminous emission
intensity compared with a conventional rare earth oxysulfide
fluorescent substance and methods for their production.Another object of this invention is to provide a
radiation detector using the fluorescent substance and an
X-ray CT
