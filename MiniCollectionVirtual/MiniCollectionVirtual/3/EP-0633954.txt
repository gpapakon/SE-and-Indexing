<DESCRIPTION>
This invention relates to high tenacity, heavy denier polyamide 
monofilaments, and more particularly relates to heavy denier polyamide 
monofilaments having high tenacity and high tensile uniformity and a process for 
making such monofilaments which provides improved control over drawing in 
the first draw stage. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,009,511, 4,056,652 and 5,082,611 
(EP-A-0 350 945) disclose processes for making heavy denier, high tenacity 
polyamide monofilaments which are well suited for use in reinforced rubber 
goods such as tires. These processes include the steps of spinning, water-quenching, 
and drawing a heavy denier, polyamide monofilament in at least first 
and second draw stages. In the first draw stage, the quenched monofilament is 
advanced through a steamer containing a high temperature steam atmosphere and 
is advanced in the second draw stage through a zone heated with a radiant heater. 
The monofilament is drawn to a total draw ratio of at least about 5.5X. The 
monofilaments produced by these processes have a surface with an orientation 
less than the orientation of the core which, besides imparting improved physical 
properties to the monofilaments, provides good adhesion to rubber. For achieving very high tenacities, i.e., greater than about 9 gpd (8 
dN/tex), using processes of this type, it has been discovered that it is desirable 
for the extent of crystallization in the quenched monofilament to be low so that 
the monofilament can be drawn to higher draw ratios. This low crystallinity can 
be accomplished by very rapid cooling of the filament in cold quench water with 
an extended residence time so that the monofilament core temperature is cooled 
to below about 55°C. However, when the temperature of the core of the 
quenched monofilament is below about 55°C, problems can arise in the first draw 
stage. Rather than the desired single "neck" draw at the draw point, a series of 
separated necks may form that "run together" as the draw is completed. This 
type of draw results in low and variable tensile properties and poor spinning 
continuity and becomes more prevalent in higher denier monofilament as the 
thickness becomes greater since it is usually necessary with thicker filaments to 
get the surface and average temperature of the monofilament well below about 
55°C so that the core temperature is below about 55°C.  
 The process disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,082,611 provides a 
method for controlling the location of the draw point and can provide a standard 
deviation of
