<ABSTRACT>
An assistant for printing which contains water soluble hemicellulose as an effective component. This assistant has excellent 
film formation characteristics, long shelf life, excellent emulsification characteristics, excellent desensitization characteristics for 

non-image portions, and excellent emulsification stability and continuous stability as a damping water composition for printing.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a lithographic printing process and the use
of a printing assistant for lithographic printing plates.
More particularly, it is concerned with the use of a
printing assistant as a protective
agent, a cleaner, an image eraser, a
sensitization protective agent, a gum remover, or a dampening
water composition for lithographic printing plates.Lithography is a printing method which effectively
utilizes the property of water and oil in that they
essentially do not mix. A printing plate for lithography
comprises a water-receptive and oil-base-ink-repellent
portion and a water-repellent and oil-base-ink-receptive
portion, with the former constituting a nonimage area and
the latter constituting an image area.In general, assistants for a lithographic printing
plate, such as printing plate protective agents, printing
plate cleaners, image erasers, sensitization protective
agents and gum removers, are used in order to protect the
nonimage areas. Water-soluble polymers having a film
formability have hitherto been used as an indispensable
ingredient of the assistant.For example, in the final step of lithography, a
plate protective agent is coated (this procedure being
usually referred to as "gumming") for the purpose of
protecting the nonimage areas.The plate protective agent is used in order to
maintain the hydrophilicity of the nonimage areas by
taking advantage of the film formability and for other
purposes such as correction in image areas, such as
retouching or elimination, storage in a period between
after plate making and before initiation of printing or
storage until reuse, prevention of contamination caused
by deposition of fingerprints, fats and oils, dust, etc., 
during handling at the time of mounting the plate in a
printing machine, protection against occurrence of flaws
and prevention of contamination by oxidation.In most cases, the conventional plate protective
agent comprises a solution of a water-soluble polymer,
such as gum arabic, cellulose gum or a polymer having a
carboxyl group in its molecule and optional additives,
such as pH adjustors and preservatives.In the plate protective agent, when gum arabic,
which is a naturally occurring plant gum substance, is
used as the water-soluble polymer, it exhibits an
excellent film formability.On the other hand, as well known in the art, in the
production of a photosensitive lithographic printing
plate, removal of an unnecessary image, that is, the so-called
"image erasing," is carried out subsequent to the
step of forming an
