<ABSTRACT>
In a termination machine (20) for inserting wires 
(22) into insulation displacement slots (32) (see Fig. 8) 

of terminals (24) of an electrical connector (26) during 
each termination stroke, a connector locating member (80) 

moves together with a termination blade (128) to precisely 
position the connector (26) for termination. A wire 

locator (144) moves together with the termination blade 
(128) and moves the wire (22) into a guide slot (148) in a 

template (146) over the connector (26). When the blade 
(128), the wire (22) and the connector (26) are in precise 

alignment, the termination blade (128) completes the 
termination stroke. A feed slide (62) and pawl system (72, 

78) moves the connector (26) in steps equal to the terminal 

centerline spacing (X) (Fig. 9) and the feed stroke is 
selectively adjusted to skip voids where terminals (24) are 

not to be terminated with wires (22).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to termination of
electrical connectors and more particularly to improvements
in apparatus and methods for applying wires to connectors
having insulation displacement terminals.Insulation displacement connectors have the advantage
that the insulation does not need to be stripped
from the metal conductor of a wire before termination.
Such connectors have insulation displacement slots into
which wires are forced. The walls of the slots displace
the insulation and contact the metal conductors.Many insulation displacement connectors include
an array or row of terminals disposed in a series of cavities
in a connector housing. The cavities and the terminals
are arrayed in a regular pattern having a predetermined
centerline spacing. Conforming with a trend toward
miniaturization, the centerline spacing between adjacent
terminals of insulation displacement connectors is decreasing.
Similarly, smaller wire gauges are being used with
insulation displacement connectors. These trends result in
problems in accurately positioning a wire and a terminal
slot relative to one another so that the wire is successfully
terminated by the termination blade of terminating 
apparatus. If the wire and the slot are not accurately positioned
relative to the termination tool, the wire may not
be forced into the terminal slot or the terminal may be improperly
deformed by the tool.One type of termination apparatus used for insulation
displacement connectors operates to terminate a single
wire into a terminal during each operating cycle. Connectors
are fed in steps to position each cavity of the
connector housing in registration with the terminating
tool. Often it is desired that no wire be applied to selected
cavities or terminals. In addition, a series of
connectors may be fed end-to-end through the terminating
apparatus with a space between adjacent end cavities of two
connector housings equal to twice the terminal centerline
spacing. In such instances, referred to as voids, the termination
apparatus cycles through a wasted step since the
connectors are advanced in centerline spacing increments.
These wasted cycles of operation add up to significant
waste in production.US-A-4,724,609 discloses a single
step terminating machine for insulation displacement terminals
using a spring loaded indexing pawl mechanism cooperating
with a cam arm on the termination head to index the
connector one slot at a time through a termination station.
US-A-4,389,769 and 4,575,932 disclose hand
