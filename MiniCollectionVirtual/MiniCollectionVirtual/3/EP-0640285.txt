<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to a washing agent for disinfecting and decontaminating hands, which is characterised in that it comprises an aqueous solution containing     a) 5 to 35 % by weight of C1-C19-alkyl alcohol, b) 0.1 to 10.0 % by weight of naturally occurring C6-aryl-C1-C8-alkyl alcohol, c) 0.5 to 45 % by weight of sulphosuccinate, betaine or fatty alcohol ether sulphate, or a mixture of these, and d) 0.1 to 5.0 % by weight of dermatologically acceptable  alpha -hydroxycarboxylic acid as skin protection component and for bringing the pH to 2 to 7.
