<ABSTRACT>
The method for continuously checking the weight of 
bottles (2) includes weighing twice all the bottles 

(2) which are conveyed along a transport line so as 
to enter and exit carousel (3) for filling the same 

bottles (2). 
Such weighing is carried out by respective weighing 
means (18) and (19) placed along said transport line 

and provided with their own conveying means (23), 
so as to be independent from the same transport 

line.

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to the technical field
concerning weight-checking while filling bottles and
the like with products.It is known that, during the phase of filling the
bottles, the weight of the bottles is checked to
verify whether such filling corresponds to prefixed
values.In particular, the empty bottles are weighed,
before being filled, and subsequently, the full
bottles are weighed before being closed by traditional
caps or covers with metal rings.Various realisations of the weight check are known,
mostly very complicated, that usually check only
samples from the bottles.A known apparatus for the bottles filling feed said
bottles to a filling carousel by a conveying belt
cooperating with an Archimedean screw, placed over
it and rotating according to a longitudinal axis
parallel to the same conveying belt.The Archimedean screw separates the bottles that are
arranged at regular distances one from the other so
as to be subsequently brought, in an orderly manner,
to the above mentioned filling carousel.The bottles are weighed at a turning star-like
transferring device, that, rotating in suitable
phase relation, takes the bottles fed by the above 
mentioned Archimedean screw and transfers them
regularly to the filling carousel.The transferring device is equipped with means
designed to select the bottles that, according to
the pre-fixed sampling, are then transferred to
suitable weighing means, before being directed to
the filling phase of the above mentioned carousel.A similar turning star-like device, placed at the
exit of the filling carousel, selects the same
bottles so as to weigh them after they have been
filled with the product.Obviously, the weight control executed on the sampling
does not guarantee the effective correspondence
of the weight of all the bottles to the prefixed
value.It is also to be remembered that during the above
mentioned transferring of the selected bottles to
the weighing means, it is necessary to keep regular
the distribution of the same bottles, that results
in further increase of structural complexity of such
apparatus.The object of the present invention is to propose a
method that allows for a continuous check of the
weight of the bottles, when they are filled, keeping
regular the reciprocal distance of the same bottles
along the production line.A further object of the present invention is to
provide an apparatus that carries out such method
and that comprises a structure of simple concept, 
limited size and reliable use.The listed objects are obtained in

<CLAIMS>
Apparatus for continuously checking the weight of
bottles in a machine wherein the bottles are moved along

running planes (8) by conveyors (7,12) equipped with
belts (9,13) mounted on pairs of wheels (10,14) having

a vertical axis, said belts having regularly spaced out
crosspieces (11,15) for engaging the bottles, so that

said bottles are fed to and moved away from a carousel
(3) for filling the same bottles (2), with weighing means

(18,19) arranged in line with said belt conveyors (7,12),
the apparatus being 
characterised in that
 said running
planes (8) feature each one an opening in the region of

which said weighing (18,19) means are located, 
in that

said weighing means (18,19) include each one a conveyor
belt (23) having an upper run making a joining section

for the running plane (8) and an electronic balance
placed under said conveyor belt (23), said bottles (2)

being moved away from said crosspieces (11,15) while
being weighed.
Apparatus, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

the plate of said balance (20) is substantially coplanar

with said running plane (8).
Apparatus, according to claim 2, 
characterised in that

said upper run of said conveyor belt (23) slides over the
plates (21) of the electronic balance (20) and makes a

joining section between the sections of said running
plane (8) divided by said opening. 
Apparatus, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

said electronic balance is mounted on a support frame
(45) independent from the structure of the machine, so

that it can be extracted from the machine and readily set
on another machine.
Apparatus according to claim 1, 
characterised in
that
:
said electronic balance includes a plate (121) hinged at
one end to said support frame, so that it can swing

about a horizontal axis (128), with the free end of the
said plate (121) resting on the balance (120);
said conveyor belt is an endless belt (123) and is
mounted on said plate (121), that is located with its

upper run at the same level as the running plane (8);
driving means (125) are linked to said endless belt
(123) and are so operated that the upper run of the

endless belt moves in accordance with the motion
direction of the belt (9), slightly faster than this

latter;
two link supports (122) connect the upper run of the
endless belt (123) with the upstream and downstream

sections of the said running plane (8).
Apparatus, according to claim 1, 
characterised in that

said crosspieces (11, 15) are hinged to said belts (9,
13) on respective vertical pins (11a), and are designed

to engage, in correspondence with said weighing means 
(18, 19) suitable striking means that have the task of

provoking backward rotation of the same crosspiece (11,
15), against the reaction of suitable elastic means, so

as to cause the separation of said crosspiece (11, 15)
from said bottles (2).
Method for continuously checking the weight of bottles
in a machine wherein the bottles are moved along running

planes (8) by conveyors (7,12) equipped with belts (9,13)
mounted on pairs of wheels (10,14) having a vertical

axis, said belts having regularly spaced out crosspieces
(11,15) for engaging the bottles, so that said bottles

are fed to and moved away from a carousel (3) for filling
the same bottles (2), with weighing means (18,19)

arranged in line with said belt conveyors (7,12), the
method being 
characterised in that
 it includes moving
forward the bottles (2) during weighing step by means of

a conveyor belt (23) having an upper run making a joining
section for the running plane (8) and an electronic

balance placed under said conveyor belt (23), so that the
bottles are made independent from said conveyors (7,12)

during weighing.
Method according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 said
conveyor belt (23) is moved faster than said belts (9,13)

of said conveyor (7,12) so as to move forward the bottles
(2) with respect to the crosspieces (11,15).
Method according to claim 7, 
characterised in that
 the
tip speed (W2) of the said conveyor belt(23) is equal to

the speed (W1) of said conveyors (7, 12) and the 
crosspieces (11,15) are turned backward by striking means

so as to make said bottles (2) separate from the same
crosspieces (11,15).
