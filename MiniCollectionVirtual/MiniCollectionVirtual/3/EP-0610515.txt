<ABSTRACT>
A process for producing a polymer hydroxylated at both the terminals thereof from a wide variety of vinylic monomers including 
polar ones readily and efficiently at a low cost. The process comprises polymerizing a vinylic monomer (a) in the presence 

of an alcohol (b) which does not enter addition polymerization by using an initiator system (c) essentially comprising a peroxide 
in such a manner that f
urther use is made of at least one catalyst (d) selected from the group consisting of organic sulfonic 
acid compounds which do not enter addition polymerization and inorganic acids and that the reactor is substantially free from 

any component other than the above components (a) through (d).

<DESCRIPTION>
The present invention relates to a process for 
producing a polymer having a hydroxyl group at both 
terminals. A polymer having a hydroxyl group at both 
terminals is able to convert easily the hydroxyl group 
into other functional groups by carrying out a suitable 
reaction on the terminal hydroxyl group, and also, the 
polymer itself converts into a linear molecule and/or a 
network molecule by using reactivity of the terminal 
hydroxyl group and carrying out a suitable reaction on 
this hydroxyl group and, as a result, the polymer 
becomes a high-molecular compound having excellence in 
various properties such as strength, heat resistance, 
weather resistance, durability and so forth. This polymer having a hydroxyl group at both 
terminals has, for example, the following great 
advantages 1) to 6) by displaying a feature such as 
having a hydroxyl group at both terminals. 
1) In a case where the polymer is used as a raw 
material (for example, a crosslinking agent) for 
various kinds of resins such as a polyester resin, a 
polyurethane  
 
resin and a polycarbonate resin, since there is 
not any unreacted material, all polymers are surely 
assembled in a resin-cross linked structure. Therefore, 
various kinds of resins using the polymer does not show 
physical property-lowering derived from the unreacted 
material. 2 ○ A polymer in which a functional group has been 
introduced into a side chain by copolymerizing a vinyl-based 
monomer having a functional group such as a hydroxyl 
group, a carboxyl group and an amino group 
(hereinafter, abbreviated as "a copolymer of a functional 
group-containing vinyl-based monomer"); when said polymer is 
used for a reaction, its terminal becomes a play part (a 
free terminal) which is not assembled in the resin (-crosslinked) 
structure, but such a thing does not occur in 
a polymer having a hydroxyl group at both terminals. 3 ○ Compared with the copolymer of a functional 
group-containing vinyl-based monomer, because scattering in 
the distance between the functional groups is very small, 
the distance between reacting sites (crosslinking sites) is 
nearly constant, so that a homogeneous resin (-crosslinked) 
structure is made. 4 ○ In a case of a copolymer of a functional group-containing 
vinyl-based monomer, even if the synthesis of a 
thermoplastic polymer is attempted by making a material of  
 
2.0 in the average number of functional groups and by 
allowing this to react with a chain-elongating agent having 
two functionalities, since a polymer having
