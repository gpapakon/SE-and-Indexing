<ABSTRACT>
The invention relates to an apparatus, in a vehicle, for transmitting data to a fixed beacon, which operates according to the passive transponder method. The continuous signal transmitted by the beacon is reflected and modulated using a controllable impedor, preferably a microwave diode. The microwave diode is controlled via two inputs in such a way that it can assume three operating conditions. Optimum operating conditions can be created for the diode with the aid of the three operating conditions, which correspond to the different diode control currents. Furthermore, the control circuit is simple and inexpensive to manufacture.

<CLAIMS>
Vehicle apparatus for transmitting data to a fixed
beacon which has a transceiver device, having an

antenna for receiving a continuous signal which is
emitted by the beacon and having a control circuit by

means of which the received signal is modulated and can
be transmitted back to the beacon, the control circuit

(10) having a controllable impedance (4), 
characterized
in that
 the control circuit is designed to supply at
least three working currents for the controllable

impedance, the control circuit having a control input
and a modulation input and the working range of the

controllable impedance being capable of being
determined by the voltage levels at the two inputs, in

which, when there is a first level, a predefined first
control current flows through the controllable

impedance and this control current can be used to
receive the continuous signal which is transmitted by

the beacon, and the controllable impedance is increased
when a second level is applied to the control input,

with the result that a second and third control current
of the controllable impedance can be connected as a

function of the level of the modulation input for
transmission.
Vehicle apparatus according to Claim 1,

characterized in that
 the controller (10) has at least
two current sources or voltage sources for feeding the 

controllable impedance (4).
Vehicle apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the control
circuit (10) actuates the controllable impedance (4) by

means of two signals which can be combined logically.
Vehicle apparatus according to one of the
preceding claims, 
characterized in that
 the
controllable impedance is a semiconductor switch,

preferably a diode.
